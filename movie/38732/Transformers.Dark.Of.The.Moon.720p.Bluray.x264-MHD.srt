1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,372
<i>We were once a peaceful race</i>

2
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,955
<i>of intelligent, mechanical beings.</i>

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,008
<i>But then came the war</i>

4
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,633
<i>between the Autobots,</i>
<i>who fought for freedom</i>

5
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,215
<i>and the Decepticons,</i>
<i>who dreamt of tyranny.</i>

6
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,180
<i>Overmatched and outnumbered,</i>

7
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,937
<i>our defeat was all but certain.</i>

8
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,240
<i>But in the war's final days,</i>

9
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,122
<i>one Autobot ship escaped the battle.</i>

10
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,829
<i>It was carrying a secret cargo,</i>

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,757
<i>which would have changed</i>
<i>our planet's fate.</i>

12
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,391
<i>A desperate mission.</i>

13
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,102
<i>Our final hope.</i>

14
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,496
<i>A hope that vanished.</i>

15
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,090
One up there. One over there.

16
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,300
And one more down there.

17
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,595
What you got?

18
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,730
<i>Impact detected.</i>

19
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,411
We have impact confirmed.
Contact at 2250 GMT.

20
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,905
What?

21
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,578
Get me SecDef on the phone
right away.

22
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,097
<i>Mr. McNamara,</i>
<i>the President is expecting you.</i>

23
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,728
Get Bobby in here.

24
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,273
Mr. President, designation, top secret.

25
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,521
We believe a UFO has crashed
into the Moon.

26
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,773
We think the Russians are onto it
as well.

27
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,355
Well, then you tell NASA
to move heaven and earth.

28
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,656
We need to get to the moon.

29
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,700
<i>We're going to attempt</i>
<i>a manned mission</i>.

30
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,698
NASA said it would take five years.

31
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,780
You get there before the Russians.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,366
<i>I believe that this nation</i>
<i>should commit itself</i>

33
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,247
<i>to achieving the goal</i>

34
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,704
<i>before this decade is out</i>

35
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,959
<i>of landing a man on the moon</i>
<i>and returning him safely to the Earth.</i>

36
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,169
<i>Ignition sequence start.</i>

37
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:47,721
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

38
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,392
<i>All engines running.</i>

39
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,845
<i>Liftoff. We have a liftoff.</i>

40
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,649
<i>Thirty-two minutes past the hour.</i>
<i>Liftoff on Apollo 11.</i>

41
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,901
<i>Neil Armstrong reporting Apollo 11</i>
<i>on proper heading.</i>

42
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,403
<i>Apollo 11 is on the way, riding that</i>

43
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,528
<i>pillar of flame</i>

44
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:09,238
<i>from the Saturn V out there,</i>
<i>250, 000 miles away,</i>

45
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,197
<i>where the moon is waiting</i>

46
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,409
<i>for man 's first arrival.</i>

47
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,251
Houston, you're a go for landing. Over.

48
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,800
<i>Forty feet, down two and a half.</i>
<i>Picking up some dust.</i>

49
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,010
<i>Thirty feet, two and a half down.</i>
<i>Faint shadow.</i>

50
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,882
<i>Capcom, flight.</i>

51
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,936
<i>Four forward. Drifting to the right a little.</i>

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,266
<i>Down a half.</i>

53
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,853
<i>Contact light.</i>

54
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,317
<i>Okay, engine stop.</i>

55
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,278
<i>Houston,</i>

56
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,818
<i>Tranquility Base here.</i>

57
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,366
The Eagle has landed.

58
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,156
<i>We copy you down, Eagle.</i>

59
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,033
<i>You got a bunch of guys</i>
<i>about to turn blue.</i>

60
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,372
<i>We're breathing again.</i>

61
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,788
<i>Perhaps 400 million persons</i>
<i>are watching this broadcast today</i>

62
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:03,216
<i>of the greatest event in our time</i>
<i>and one of the great events</i>

63
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,294
<i>of all recorded history.</i>

64
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,880
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

65
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,550
<i>Okay, I'm gonna step off the LEM now.</i>

66
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,225
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

67
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,067
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

68
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,315
- Are we good?
- Yes, sir.

69
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,318
<i>Unofficial time on the first step, 109.</i>...

70
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,332
<i>Apollo 11? This is Houston, over.</i>

71
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,911
Eagle, we're getting
a signal interference. Do you copy?

72
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,706
<i>We now have had confirmation</i>

73
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,916
<i>of loss of signal</i>

74
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,837
<i>from the Apollo 11.</i>

75
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,842
<i>The Apollo 11 is, at the moment,</i>
<i>on the far side of the moon</i>.

76
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,349
Neil, you are dark on the rock.

77
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,355
<i>Mission is a go.</i>

78
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,850
<i>We have 21 minutes.</i>

79
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,732
<i>My God.</i>

80
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,906
<i>It's some sort of giant metal face.</i>

81
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,449
Jesus.

82
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,116
<i>Control, we are inside the ship.</i>

83
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,255
<i>Extensive damage.</i>

84
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,958
<i>Way too big to check the entire ship.</i>

85
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,137
<i>Everything's dead in here, Houston.</i>

86
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,058
<i>No signs of life anywhere.</i>

87
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,013
<i>These things are massive.</i>

88
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,606
We copy. You've got seven minutes
on your oxygen.

89
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,066
<i>We are not alone after all, are we?</i>

90
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,944
<i>No, sir. We're not alone.</i>

91
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,192
<i>Go ahead, Mr. President.</i>

92
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,871
<i>Hello, Neil and Buzz.</i>
<i>I'm talking to you by telephone</i>

93
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,540
<i>from the Oval Room</i>
<i>at the White House</i>.

94
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:45,579
<i>And this certainly has to be the most</i>
<i>historic telephone call ever made.</i>

95
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,793
<i>I just can't tell you</i>
<i>how proud we all are of you.</i>

96
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,880
<i>For every American, this has to be</i>
<i>the proudest day of our lives.</i>

97
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,928
<i>Because of what you have done.</i>...

98
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,600
<i>We have splashdown.</i>

99
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,262
<i>...</i>. <i>the heavens have become a part</i>

100
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,938
<i>of man 's world.</i>

101
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,316
<i>For one priceless moment</i>

102
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,312
<i>in the whole history of man</i>

103
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,400
<i>all the people on this Earth</i>
<i>are truly one.</i>

104
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,030
<i>One in their pride</i>
<i>in what you have done.</i>

105
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,625
<i>It inspires us to redouble our efforts</i>

106
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,297
<i>to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.</i>

107
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,367
My hero needs to wake up.

108
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,757
What is that?

109
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,930
This is your new lucky bunny.

110
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,394
It's a beautiful thought, Carly,

111
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,852
but I don't think
it's the whole bunny that's lucky.

112
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,732
You see, it's just this section here.

113
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,398
You see,
it's just the rabbit foot that's lucky.

114
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,538
Well, it's just a good luck charm.
To help you think positive?

115
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,406
Today's important.

116
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,784
Come on, get up.

117
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,995
- Hey, wear that nice tie.
- Yeah.

118
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,168
You need any money for lunch?

119
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,510
No, I don't need any money for lunch.
I have money from yesterday's lunch.

120
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,801
You love it, don't you?
I'm just your American boy toy.

121
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,424
A lover boy toy.

122
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,431
You know how demoralizing it is
to have saved the world twice

123
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,762
and still be groveling for a job?

124
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,097
People don't know
you saved the world, Sam.

125
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,978
I mean, I do. I believe you.

126
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,934
The government knows. I mean,
they could hook me up with a job

127
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,109
right here in D. C.

128
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,813
I mean, I should be working
with the Autobots, otherwise it's not fair.

129
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,114
Come on, they paid for your college.
The President gave you a hero medal.

130
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,287
<i>Thank you, man. Great job.</i>

131
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,999
That's the coolest thing
that ever happened to me.

132
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,293
All right, guys.

133
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,122
- What the fuck!
- Wow.

134
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,708
And, as I recall, that wasn't even
the highlight of your day.

135
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,507
Mr. Ambassador, here.

136
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,754
British Embassy, you're up next.

137
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,766
No, you don't wear it.
See, you've gotta... The box.

138
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,973
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

139
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,682
You're supposed to leave it
in the box, right?

140
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,984
You keep it in this.
What a gorgeous box.

141
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,616
Oh, yeah. My medal.
You know who gave that to me?

142
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,247
- Who?
- POUTS.

143
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,496
President of the United States.

144
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,211
Babe, it's hard for everybody
to get a job.

145
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,418
I don't have time. You see, my parents
are gonna be here in a week

146
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,594
on their road trip Partybus World Tour.

147
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,842
If my dad gets here
and I don't have a job,

148
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,599
he's gonna spank me.
You know, it's go time for me.

149
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,802
All right, tonight, I'll give you a job.

150
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,019
Romance me with a nice dinner
and maybe you can get that bonus.

151
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,404
- Get lucky.
- Get him out of here.

152
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,615
Wait. No, no, no, no.

153
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,989
- Oh, he's gross!
- She's good.

154
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,866
They're stranded here. Somebody's
got to watch out for them.

155
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,289
Yesterday, that one was
in my underwear drawer.

156
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,451
Did research. Looking real good, too.

157
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,081
No need to hit me.

158
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,164
- You are not a normal boyfriend.
- That's what you love about me.

159
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,374
- Crybaby.
- We're not at the love word yet.

160
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,381
Maybe a little bit closer when you're
covering your half of the rent.

161
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,296
Good-bye.

162
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,299
Frickin' shorting my circuits out here!

163
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,851
It's inhumane, what it is!
Make us live in a box

164
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,227
on a balcony, right next to a beast!
Like a common animal!

165
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,397
Stop, okay?

166
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,897
You and your creepy sidekick
can't be in here without permission.

167
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,852
According to who?
Miss Blondie Blonde?

168
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,813
Giddyup, little doggie!

169
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,111
- Yo, Brains, wassup?
- Doing good.

170
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,868
Shit, I seen this one.
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.

171
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,826
You know, Sam, I don't know
about moving in with this chick.

172
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,785
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

173
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,920
She was mean. Didn't like her.

174
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,543
Us guys got to stick together.

175
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,174
<i>We are family</i>

176
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,092
No, we are not family.
You're a political refugee,

177
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,469
and I have finally found someone
who appreciates me for me.

178
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,555
Well, you tell her
that we're not your pets,

179
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,931
and we're not your toys!

180
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,139
All right? We're an advanced, genius
alien race just looking for a home.

181
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,065
- Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
- Didn't have to stop.

182
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,736
Come on.
What're they going to do, tow it?

183
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,359
Where is he?

184
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,365
Sammy!

185
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,369
- Come on, that's funny!
- Sam.

186
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,618
I missed you guys so much.

187
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,540
Sure, you did. What do you think?

188
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,867
- Look at that.
- Cute.

189
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,418
- You look old.
- Stop it.

190
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,585
Feel like I can see the end.

191
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,755
I love your little tie.
Hey, where's my girl?

192
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,457
- Where's my beautiful Carly?
- She's at work, Ma.

193
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,793
She's got a new job. You guys said
you were gonna be here in a week.

194
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,218
The 21st, not the 11th, Dad, remember?

195
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,637
We just hauled ass in this thing.

196
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,557
- We stopped for gas.
- This thing. The love tub, it flies.

197
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,560
Are we keeping you from something?
Like, say, your job?

198
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,979
Well, it's about time.
You had us worried.

199
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,229
I have job interviews.

200
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,445
That's good.

201
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,988
- That sucks.
- Stop it.

202
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,986
You don't have to be so negative, Dad.
You know, you're in D. C.

203
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,317
You're here with your son
and your family.

204
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,368
- I mean, it's a good time.
- It sucks that you don't have a job.

205
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,162
Yeah, but there's good things
to do here, too, right?

206
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,989
Right? Museums
and monuments, okay?

207
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,620
- I'll see you tonight.
- I'm bagging the gift.

208
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,502
Sam, I think for an interview
you should wear real pants.

209
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,830
I think for life,
you should wear real pants.

210
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,290
What happened to Bumblebee?

211
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,501
He's off on his missions.
I had to get this for backup.

212
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,303
- Your car has a job, huh?
- Stop.

213
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,176
What does it change into?

214
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,303
It doesn't change into anything.
It's a collector's item, Ma.

215
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,350
I got it for a steal.
It just needs some work. Trust me.

216
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,145
No, I think it's darling.
It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee,

217
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,265
if Bumblebee were a sad piece of shit.

218
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,279
Come on, we'll give you a ride!

219
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:31,029
<i>In the years since our arrival,</i>
<i>our new home, Earth,</i>

220
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,236
<i>has seen much change.</i>

221
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,410
<i>Energon detectors guard its cities now.</i>

222
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,209
<i>Long-range defense systems</i>
<i>watch the skies.</i>

223
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:46,500
<i>So now we assist our allies</i>
<i>in solving human conflicts,</i>

224
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,966
<i>to prevent mankind</i>
<i>from bringing harm to itself.</i>

225
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,692
On the ground, <i>per favore!</i>
And stay there!

226
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,171
<i>We work in secret teams</i>
<i>on various missions around the globe.</i>

227
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,714
<i>And all the while</i>

228
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,802
<i>we search for signs</i>
<i>of our true enemies' return.</i>

229
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,646
<i>I am Voshkod, General Counsel</i>
<i>with Ukrainian Department of Energy.</i>

230
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,601
<i>My government will officially deny</i>

231
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,688
that we're having this conversation.

232
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,240
At one of our decommissioned facilities,
a discovery was made,

233
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,785
which I fear may be alien in nature.

234
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,617
The facility's name is Chernobyl.

235
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,387
Mr. Voshkod.

236
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,310
So, uninhabited since '86.

237
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,897
I hear it won't be livable again
for another 20,000 years?

238
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,318
At least.
Ukraine was the most fertile land.

239
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,693
It's a tragedy.

240
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,198
This way.

241
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,702
Gear up!
We have 60 minutes on the ground.

242
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,825
Watch your radiation levels.

243
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,457
Mr. Voshkod,
where's your protective gear?

244
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,339
Where's your protective gear?

245
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,510
It would not matter.

246
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,343
For me, it's only a matter of time.

247
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,719
Through the school.

248
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,687
Yuri will take you below.
And one other thing, Colonel.

249
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,686
In private,
there were some energy experiments.

250
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,065
It can wait.

251
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,665
Keep moving. Stay tight.

252
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,873
Okay, right here. I think I found it.

253
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,126
Optimus, we got a visual.

254
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,132
Looks like the object's clamped
in some kind of a metal harness.

255
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,219
What's this? Guys!

256
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,855
Why does this thing have
Soviet space program markings on it?

257
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,395
Sputnik?

258
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,102
Energon readings, sir. It's strong.

259
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,653
Below us. It's coming fast.

260
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,448
Contact, contact!

261
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,505
Get topside now! Move, move, move!

262
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,331
- Let's go!
- Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!

263
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,162
Stay behind me!

264
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,674
Optimus!

265
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,380
Fall back!

266
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,883
It's circling around us!

267
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,726
It's taking our flank!

268
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,150
Get the heavy weapon!

269
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,314
Optimus!

270
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,047
What the hell was that thing?

271
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,425
That

272
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,544
is Shockwave.

273
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,930
Why was he after this?

274
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,342
It's impossible.

275
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:53,098
This is an engine part
from a long lost Autobot ship.

276
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,749
Pleasure working with you.

277
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,549
Interviews. This is so exciting.

278
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,464
Honey, do you want some gum?

279
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,301
Your breath gets really gnarly
when you're nervous.

280
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,103
- Mr. Witwicky?
- Yeah. Search is over.

281
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,980
I'm Mr. Whitley.

282
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,020
Mr...

283
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,610
- Is anybody else joining?
- No.

284
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,021
No? You want me to move right there?

285
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,151
- I'll move right there.
- I'd prefer not.

286
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,196
Ready? Begin.

287
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,699
Graduated this year. Majored
in geopolitics. Minor in tech studies.

288
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,199
Very interested in government
and technology,

289
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,622
how that's gonna intersect and co-exist.

290
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,915
Shape the future.

291
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,914
Why did we bother sending him
to an lvy college for?

292
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,246
Three months out of school
and he can't find a job?

293
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,830
Mr. Masuhisu...

294
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,085
Matsumoto.

295
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,713
- Matsumoto.
- Moto.

296
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,589
- Martha, can I call you Martha?
- No, you may not.

297
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,591
Okay, Jack,
there's two types of people in this world.

298
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,014
There's think ers, there's doers.

299
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,269
There's winners, there's dreamers,
and there's buddies.

300
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,346
What about some weaknesses?

301
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,223
I don't...

302
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,524
You have a very trustworthy face.

303
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,023
You remind me of
like an Asian Colonel Sanders.

304
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,603
A man I can trust.

305
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,653
He's a millennial.

306
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,232
That means they're the, you know,
like lost generation.

307
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,158
Why was the FBI looking for you?

308
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,156
The what?

309
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,612
Yeah, FBI. Good of you to flag that.

310
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,790
It was during all that alien craziness
when you were 14.

311
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,708
I mean, they were very kind to me,
found me in a jiffy.

312
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,962
And that's all been expunged.
Obama gave me a medal, actually.

313
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,540
I'm just saying.
It's always good to have a medal guy

314
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,000
in the office, with a medal.

315
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,713
- From Obama?
- Yeah.

316
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,593
In this office,
we're mostly Republicans, so...

317
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,135
I'm not feeling too good.

318
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,216
- No?
- No.

319
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,302
Why don't you get a little dipping tray
and dip the dog in Pepto?

320
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,556
That's a solution.

321
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,058
I got another one. We got to go.

322
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,264
- Come on.
- Really?

323
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,770
Sit.

324
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,191
Got myself a Mr. Sam Witwicky,
recent college graduate.

325
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,773
Previous experience, next to zero,

326
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,778
yet he has a recommend letter
from our board?

327
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,071
WTF to that.

328
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,623
- Do I know somebody on your board?
- Here's the deal.

329
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,621
You know who we are.
Accuretta Systems,

330
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:23,172
global leader in telecom, aerospace,
17 billion in profit last year.

331
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,592
We contract for DARPA, NASA, JPL,
you name it.

332
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,421
You perform here,
doors open for you anywhere.

333
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,177
First job out of college is critical, kid.

334
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,055
You either take a step
down the correct career path

335
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,603
or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.

336
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:43,226
So it all depends on how you respond
to my next two words.

337
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,102
Impress me.

338
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,029
- Now?
- Impress me.

339
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,232
You catch me off guard.

340
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,611
- I don't know where to begin.
- Impress me.

341
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,988
I'm an open book.
Ask me any question you like.

342
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,035
- So you're a go-getter, ramrod...
- Yes, sir.

343
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,238
...take-charge kind of guy?

344
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,039
I'm a killer. A stone-cold killer.

345
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,242
So, take-charge guy?

346
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,873
Tak e-charge, Viking, barbarian,
of course, that's me.

347
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,454
Pow! I'm here.

348
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,386
We are not looking for that here.

349
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:16,134
No brown-nosing. No suck up.
No toolery. I...

350
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,059
<i>Yes, Mr. Brazos.</i>

351
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,065
Why is Shontel using
what appears to be a red cup

352
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,520
from the red floor

353
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,072
- when we are on the yellow floor?
<i>- I'm on it.</i>

354
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,823
It is a visual and, therefore,
a visceral betrayal.

355
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,616
Stop it!

356
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,739
Such a dumbass.

357
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,874
Disgusting!

358
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,285
Thank you!

359
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,666
It's total anarchy around here.

360
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:51,465
The e-mail I read
said administrative aide?

361
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,258
Nope. Mailroom.

362
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,257
I'm gonna go.

363
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,929
Do you have any idea how many
lvy League Phi Beta Kappas

364
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,231
- would kill to...
- Mister, I saved your life twice. Okay?

365
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,730
I can't tell you how or when or why,

366
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,105
but I have done shit that matters

367
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,564
and I'd just kind of like a job
where I matter again.

368
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,903
So thank you, but no, thank you, okay?

369
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,199
You know what I think?
You want the job after this job.

370
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,372
But, son, this is the job
that's standing in your way.

371
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,789
And that's why you're gonna be
so very, very good at it.

372
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,370
'Cause when I look at you,
I see a younger me.

373
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:50,278
<i>All arriving Autobots, in par,</i>
<i>training and debriefing in 15 minutes.</i>

374
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,736
<i>Dino, report to Bay 23.</i>

375
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,237
<i>Sideswipe, Bay 37</i>
<i>for weapons assessment.</i>

376
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,748
Senator, I suggest you remember that

377
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,168
when the NSA wants funding,
they call me.

378
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,746
When the CIA
is gonna take out a target,

379
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,581
they ask first for my permission.

380
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,882
And when the President wants to know

381
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,085
which members of Congress
are politically vulnerable

382
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,013
in terms of, let's say,
undiscovered criminal conduct,

383
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,340
I'm the number he dials.

384
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,926
<i>U. S. Agencies say</i>
<i>they have been monitoring the blast.</i>

385
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,683
<i>But if, in fact,</i>
<i>this was a covert military strike,</i>

386
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,106
<i>- no nation has claimed responsibility.</i>
- CIA is up my ass

387
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,682
about this mystery raid
in the Middle East.

388
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,019
So, it's time to come clean.
Was your unit involved?

389
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,229
I'm not sure, ma'am.

390
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,407
All right, guys. This is how you do
a Decepticon head kill shot.

391
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,319
As Director of National Intelligence,

392
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,279
I'm a really big fan
of intelligent answers.

393
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,866
I can't really tell you definitively.
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

394
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,701
They like to sneak out of the house
every once in a while.

395
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,002
Colonel Lennox, are you in command
or are you not?

396
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,420
Yes, ma'am, I am.

397
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,463
Stop with the "ma'am."
Enough with the "ma'am."

398
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,916
Do I look like a "ma'am"?

399
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,093
No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes.

400
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,963
This gun
is my perfect invention, Ironhide.

401
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,047
Right.

402
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,848
Good, you're here!

403
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,057
Me name's Que.

404
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,932
I do hope you have answers for him.
I've never seen him so upset.

405
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,355
Optimus, you remember
Charlotte Mearing?

406
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,603
Our Director of National Intelligence?

407
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,312
He's in a bad mood.
He's not talking to anybody today.

408
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,898
What is this, the silent treatment?

409
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,655
- We've seen that and this is not that.
- Definitely not.

410
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,452
This is worse.

411
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,996
Prime! Make something of yourself!

412
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,332
He's pissed.

413
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,881
You lied to us.

414
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:39,132
Everything humans know of our planet
we were told had all been shared.

415
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,965
So why was this found
in human possession?

416
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,300
We were in the dark on this also.

417
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,386
It was Director Only clearance
at Sector 7 until now.

418
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,561
The bag.

419
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,395
- Which bag?
- Hermès. Birkin. Green ostrich!

420
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,852
Oh, my God.

421
00:26:56,198 --> 00:27:00,407
This is a secret few men knew,
and fewer still remain alive.

422
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,984
Allow me to please introduce to you

423
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,661
two of NASA's
founding mission directors

424
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,955
and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin,

425
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,454
one of the first two men
to step foot on the moon.

426
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,287
Sir? Optimus Prime.

427
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,875
From a fellow space traveler,
it's a true honor.

428
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,380
The honor is mine.

429
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:24,390
Our entire space race of the 1960s,
it appears, was in response to an event.

430
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:30,229
Our astronauts investigated
a crashed alien ship.

431
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,847
<i>No survivors onboard.</i>

432
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:35,108
We were sworn to secrecy
by our Commander in Chief.

433
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,945
This was a mission
you will never speak of.

434
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,112
I understand, sir.

435
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,409
A total of 35 people
knew the real plan at NASA.

436
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,454
Soviets managed to land
unmanned probes.

437
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,825
Somehow they must have picked up
that fuel rod.

438
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,289
We believe the Russians deduced

439
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,416
that the rod
was a fissionable fuel assembly,

440
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,590
believed they had it mastered,
and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.

441
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,009
We landed six missions in all.

442
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,712
<i>We took hundreds of photos</i>
<i>and samples.</i>

443
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,593
<i>We locked them away forever,</i>

444
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,512
and the moon program was shut down.

445
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,844
Well, did you search the crash vault?

446
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,520
The ship's name was the <i>Ark.</i>

447
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,523
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

448
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:23,240
It was carrying an Autobot technology
which would have won us the war.

449
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,318
And its captain.

450
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,236
Who was its captain?

451
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:31,244
The great Sentinel Prime,
the technology's inventor.

452
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:35,078
He was commander of the Autobots
before me.

453
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,787
It's imperative that I find it

454
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,794
before the Decepticons learn
of its location.

455
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,798
Our Autobot spacecraft
has the ability to get there.

456
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,472
And you must pray it's in time.

457
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,105
Hi. I'm here to see Carly Spencer.

458
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,827
Carly!

459
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,913
- You got the job?
- This is crazy.

460
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,164
- You really got it?
- Yes.

461
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,497
See, what did I tell you? It's the bunny.

462
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,790
You are so welcome.

463
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,001
- Do you like me more?
- A little bit, yeah.

464
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,211
You said you were his assistant curator,

465
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,761
you didn't say
the guy owns Space Mountain.

466
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:31,091
I know. Isn't it beautiful in here?
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.

467
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,301
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

468
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,476
Sam.

469
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,764
Dylan Gould.

470
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,188
Hey. A pleasure to meet you.

471
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,271
Pleasure meeting you.
Carly's told me a lot about you.

472
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,697
Well, vice versa.
It's a beautiful building you got.

473
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,320
It's like the Starship <i>Enterprise</i> in here.

474
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,947
Thank you very much. It leaks.

475
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,902
Before Carly came
to help run the collection,

476
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,704
it was just a complete mess.

477
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,032
But now,
the restorations are back on track.

478
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,162
We're going to Pebble Beach this year,

479
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,289
and we're gonna get a trophy
for that stand right there.

480
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,213
You know why?
Because this woman right here

481
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,627
- is my secret weapon.
- Okay.

482
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,132
Mr. Gould, please, you exaggerate.
All I've done is get you organized.

483
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,759
You've done much more than that,
my Duchess.

484
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,387
Nicknames, that's fun.

485
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,468
Yeah. The Duchess.

486
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,643
She's adorable.

487
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,020
You know, when I stole her away
from the British Embassy,

488
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,689
I said, "It's easy to manage a country.

489
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,142
"Try managing
a priceless collection of art."

490
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,947
Tak e a look
at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

491
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,114
Designed by a Frenchman.

492
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,407
Look at the curves.
Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.

493
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,038
Sensual.

494
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,374
Built to evoke the body
of the ideal woman.

495
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,076
Come on.

496
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,707
My dad had a $ 10 desk and a dream,
and he built it into an empire.

497
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,424
Wow.

498
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,752
We're the largest accounting firm
in the U.S.

499
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,840
I started up the venture side
after he passed. Invest in the future.

500
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,175
Try and bet on the winners.

501
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,012
See, collecting cars helps me
keep my sanity.

502
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,478
You guys look great.

503
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,899
That was a great day, Mr. Gould.

504
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,030
- I haven't seen that one.
- No. Me, neither.

505
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,736
Jeans are tight.

506
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:19,162
Here we go. Here we go. You see that?

507
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,742
Judgment. Judging a man by his car?

508
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,418
And you're gonna wave at him
while he's judging me?

509
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,714
What's with you? He's my boss.
This job pays for our food, our rent.

510
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,417
No, I totally understand.
I'm totally fine. I get it. I'm well fed.

511
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,218
And guess what?
I'm not your boy toy anymore.

512
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,011
I got my big boy pants on.
You see them?

513
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,305
In the car. Thank you, Duchess.

514
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,099
Oh, my God.
Are you threatened by him?

515
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,602
Threatened? What am I threatened by?
His money? His power? His good looks?

516
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,058
None of the above. Check!

517
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,189
God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

518
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,396
Get in the car, please.

519
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,483
Sam, he's hardly the first man
to ever smile at me.

520
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,862
- I think I can handle it.
- Hold on, hold on.

521
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,196
It's the smiling back part
that gets me. Okay?

522
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,996
No more smiles. Never again. I promise.

523
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,828
That works for me.

524
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,918
Easy! Easy!
You're not gonna get it started that way.

525
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,049
Well, I was just getting it ready.
I'm about 32% done with my restoration.

526
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,223
Some chrome work,
put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.

527
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,634
You know, Carly's been telling me
you've been struggling job-wise.

528
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,267
Just so you know,

529
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,688
I'm on the board for Accuretta Systems,
and I put in a call for you.

530
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,858
Let's keep it between us, okay?
She's so proud of you.

531
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,319
You're a lucky man.

532
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,651
Xanthium <i>approaching Tranquility Base.</i>

533
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,453
<i>You're a go for landing.</i>

534
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,166
Ratchet, let's roll.

535
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,685
We're entering the <i>Ark.</i>

536
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,002
His levels are faint.

537
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,763
He locked himself away
to guard the pillars.

538
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,635
Sentinel.

539
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,260
You're coming home, old friend.

540
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:27,517
All hail Megatron.

541
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,565
My master! Yes, my master! Yes!

542
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:46,824
Don't be greedy, my fragile ones.

543
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,127
My poor master.

544
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,208
How it pains me to see you so wounded,
so weak.

545
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,591
Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!

546
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,639
You know what you are told,
which is nothing.

547
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,100
Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.

548
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:17,107
And what news
from your little assassin?

549
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,405
Autobots have taken the bait!

550
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:23,076
They've discovered the <i>Ark</i>
and returned with its cargo.

551
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:28,032
You did me great honor
tracking that ship to the moon.

552
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:33,587
Your human collaborators
have served their purpose, Soundwave.

553
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,837
It's time to eliminate loose ends.

554
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,011
<i>Laserbeak, kill them all.</i>

555
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,634
<i>With pleasure.</i>

556
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,312
Is your daddy home?

557
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,360
- "Then Madeline said..."
- Madeline!

558
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,113
Hello, Mom.

559
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,202
Get out of the house!

560
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,126
- What are you doing in my house?
- Just visiting.

561
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,679
What is this hoochie-mama outfit?

562
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,684
No, this is the aerospace division!
We do not allow that here!

563
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,861
New guy! You see that?
That's a Latin meltdown, okay?

564
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,314
You ever show up in my office
with a hoochie-mama outfit, you're fired.

565
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,444
You got that?

566
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,696
Okay, you're gonna be on this cart
for two-and-a-half years, okay?

567
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,072
I want you to live it, love it and name it.

568
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,163
There's no ladder climbing in my office.
I run a tight ship. Okay?

569
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,581
- Yes, sir.
- Move!

570
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,557
I found that paper
I was telling you about.

571
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,354
- What are we looking at?
- Shut up!

572
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,977
You do that to me again,
and I'll kick your ass!

573
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,947
Hi.

574
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,149
Hi, angel.

575
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,609
- How are you?
- Good.

576
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,570
I had a meeting downtown.
Was it okay for me to stop by?

577
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,701
I don't know.
My 500-page employee conduct manual

578
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,907
isn't exactly a page turner.

579
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,037
This is great.

580
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,835
Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world,
and I have organized four binders.

581
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,332
I'm living the dream. Come on.

582
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,795
Visitor violation.

583
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,130
- You okay?
- Absolutely.

584
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,138
I'm next.

585
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,356
Listen. Saturday.
Dylan's throwing a party at his house.

586
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,024
It's a work thing,
but he's invited you, too.

587
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,100
Did he?

588
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,561
I want you to come
and laugh at my bad jokes.

589
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,145
It would really mean a lot to me, okay?

590
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,026
I'd love to go. How'd you get over here?

591
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,946
- Car.
- You don't have a car.

592
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,157
- Yes, I do.
- What, did you win it in a raffle?

593
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,613
He gave me one.

594
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,788
He gave you a car?

595
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,457
Yeah, I think it was a work perk.

596
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,659
A work perk.

597
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:22,293
- What kind of car did he give you?
- A Mercedes SLS AMG.

598
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,632
Really throaty engine.

599
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,760
<i>Mercedes-Benz SLS</i>

600
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,346
<i>- combines breathtaking performance.</i>...
- You drove this here?

601
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,932
That's a $200, 000 car.

602
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:34,972
I know.

603
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,894
You know how long it would take me
to afford a car like this?

604
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,977
- A long time?
- Yeah, like 53 years.

605
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,353
He said it was for both of us.

606
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,480
Then what we should do is,
we should sell it and buy a house.

607
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,397
You're frustrated, I know.

608
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,740
I've been there.

609
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,365
It's called paying your dues.
Good things will happen.

610
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,740
Ladies and gentlemen,

611
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,323
I need some lunch time filing done, stat.

612
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,534
Who would like
to score some Bruce Brazos points?

613
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,665
Bruce, you found your guy.

614
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,751
Witwicky!

615
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,588
The man who makes this company run.

616
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:09,886
Now, who have we here?

617
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,806
Is it a sister, Facebook friend,
Twitter tweeter?

618
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,099
- Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.
- Hi.

619
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,518
I'm his girlfriend.
A pleasure to meet you. Sam was right.

620
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,311
You really do have
a smashing head of hair.

621
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,764
Well, thank you.

622
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,353
- Sam, I got to run.
- Yeah.

623
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,231
Here, your present.

624
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,692
Your favorite color.

625
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,283
- N ice to meet you, Mr. Brazos.
- And you.

626
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,203
See you, boys.

627
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,379
I'm still stewing about
that binder incident, Jerry.

628
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,582
May I finish my Shuhua milk, Donny?

629
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,919
I don't care about your exotic milk.
I care about respect!

630
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,815
I know who you are!

631
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,491
Witwicky! Witwicky!

632
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,032
- I'm talking to you!
- Excuse me. Thank you.

633
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,122
Slow down, tiger.

634
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,040
You showed up in the background
of six different photos,

635
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,743
two continents, with aliens.

636
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,207
That was you in Egypt, right?
Because you know the aliens.

637
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,882
See you!

638
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,177
Give me my jacket!

639
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,181
I'm Wang. Deep Wang. Deep Wang.

640
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,724
You're not getting it. Deep Throat.

641
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,025
Watergate? I'm talking code to you...

642
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,603
Damn it.

643
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,480
They watch and listen.

644
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,367
I can't go to the government,
but you can!

645
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,784
Because shit's going down, son!
It is Code Pink, as in Floyd!

646
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,536
Dark Side! Why do you think
no one's been up there since 1972?

647
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,085
I know you're speaking English,
it's just a very strange English.

648
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,333
That's why I'm not...

649
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,085
Don't. I'm gonna hit you.

650
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,841
I'm gonna hit you right back, son.

651
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,801
It's my manifesto.

652
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,132
They're whacking us out,

653
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,804
everyone who knows
what's on the dark...

654
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,596
Your alien friends are in danger,
you know, the good ones. It's up to you.

655
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,014
Calm down.

656
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,726
Easy, Sam!

657
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,865
What are you looking at?

658
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,363
Yo, dawg.

659
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,742
Are you up in my shit?
Who are you working for?

660
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,329
Staredown, you and me.

661
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,411
Guess I won.

662
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,999
Moon satellites.

663
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,252
The Russian space program.

664
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,471
Experts dead.

665
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,263
Space program ends.

666
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,142
Dark side... Dark side of the moon.

667
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,103
Look what I found outside the bathroom.
Is it yours?

668
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,226
- Deal with this.
- Yes, sir.

669
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,564
I did everything you want!

670
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,358
I really think we should talk,
'cause some of the stuff...

671
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,189
Whoa! Knock first!

672
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,569
Can't you see I'm busy?

673
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,658
Who are you? Who are you?

674
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,070
You straddled me in the stall.

675
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,035
That's happened to me once in this life.
I wouldn't forget it.

676
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,826
From the bathroom stall.
You took your package out.

677
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,287
- You took your package out.
- Whoa! We are not boyfriends, okay?

678
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,710
One phone call from me
and I'll have you fired.

679
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,632
Yes, I will, Gaylord!

680
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,217
Are you okay?

681
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,129
Hemorrhoids!

682
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,964
Should I come back?
When should I come back?

683
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,800
Come back
when you learn some manners!

684
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,557
I don't know him!
I would never say anything!

685
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,069
Okay, okay!
I sabotaged the mapping satellite,

686
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,192
just like I promised,

687
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,989
I can put a blind spot in the program
as a bonus.

688
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,863
What more do you want from me?

689
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,741
Jerry, you are my favorite.

690
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,413
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

691
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:10,460
I know, but my superiors need me to...

692
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,747
- Please, you don't have to...
...suicide you.

693
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,342
What did you say to Witwicky?

694
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,045
Shit!

695
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,931
Who wants some chick en dinner now,
bitch?

696
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,182
'Cause somebody messed
with the wrong Wang today!

697
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,731
Come on! You want some of me?

698
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,700
I don't need any more didactic lectures
from Chuck.

699
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:47,871
Jesus!

700
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,874
Get legal.

701
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,007
That's Jerry!

702
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,380
Come on, people.
Yes, a workmate died,

703
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,632
but looking out the window
is not going to bring him back.

704
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,883
The man was depressed.

705
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,010
Don't take a picture!

706
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,342
You can keep watching him,
but he's not getting up.

707
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,927
You all read "Humpty Dumpty." Okay?

708
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,312
Witwicky.

709
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,231
I'm spearheading the press.
You clean up.

710
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:18,152
Wang is everywhere. He is in the bistro.

711
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,571
He's in the bamboo.
He's on the balustrade.

712
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,570
You see the sidewalk down there? Man!

713
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,698
Box up his personals.
Get his name off his parking space.

714
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,495
Hey, when did we get a new copier?

715
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,699
Listen, I'm not gonna say anything
about what I saw.

716
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,661
Who you share a toilet stall with
is totally your business.

717
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,497
This is exceedingly Japanese.

718
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,214
They never make it easy, do they?

719
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,125
- What is with you?
- This is the real deal, Carly, okay?

720
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,553
I need you to stay composed.
It's real life. I'll explain it to you later.

721
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,141
We've got an emergency.
You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here.

722
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,810
I'm reporting a Decepticon.
The Decepticons are back.

723
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:33,977
You gotta open that gate right now.

724
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,556
Easy, sir.
This is Health and Human Services.

725
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,141
Right. Packing M4s?

726
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,601
What are you protecting,
colostomy bags?

727
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,980
- Bedpans? Throat lozenges?
- Babe...

728
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,562
Where'd you get that hat from,
nursing school?

729
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,363
So, you're nurses
and foot-powder protectors? Fantastic.

730
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,530
- Babe.
- Yes.

731
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,698
I don't think we're in the right place.

732
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:47,775
We are in the right place.

733
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,906
We're in the right place
and I'm gonna talk to Optimus right now.

734
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:50,952
- You're gonna get Optimus out here.
- Sir.

735
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,029
Sir, you got the wrong building.

736
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,113
I don't know what you're talking about.

737
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,915
What part of "Decepticons are back"
do you not understand?

738
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,584
Yo! You being a smartass?

739
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,664
Do not hit my car! It's a collector's item!

740
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,005
I wouldn't do that.

741
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,333
You're crazy!

742
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:06,961
We got an Energon reading!

743
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,592
We've got aliens in the vehicle!

744
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,846
You move, you're dead! Out! Out!

745
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,801
Got aliens in the vehicle!

746
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,263
- Freeze! Get out!
- We're freezing!

747
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,939
Are you...

748
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,357
Are you kidding me?

749
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,025
Sam, they've got guns!

750
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:27,198
- I got him. Go!
- Bee! Is Bee in there?

751
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,942
Okay, all right!

752
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,574
This how you treat Autobots?
We're on the same team.

753
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,247
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-Eleven,
dickhead.

754
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,165
- That's right.
- A-hole.

755
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,993
How's your car now?

756
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,424
That's my car.

757
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,930
Come here.

758
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,007
Come here!

759
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,093
Come on. Sam.

760
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,393
What is your deal?

761
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,179
I know your black ops stuff
is important to you.

762
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,560
I'm not trying to diminish it
or guilt-trip you or anything,

763
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,141
I just never see you anymore.

764
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,568
You can't come to the garage
and just hang out one night?

765
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,771
Sam. That makes me feel bad.

766
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,397
I hope you feel bad.
You should feel bad.

767
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,199
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.
I feel bad every single day.

768
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,619
Yo, let's go, both of you.
Lennox wants to see you.

769
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,071
What, we not good enough
for you anymore?

770
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,533
I'm sorry, babe.
They were very rude, all right?

771
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,585
And you're fixing my car.
You don't think so?

772
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,920
Raise your hand if you had
a flying psycho-ninja copier

773
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:24,997
trying to kill you today!

774
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,172
Those are my brass knuckles.

775
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,171
That's my anklet.
Do I have to take that off, too?

776
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,297
And my toe rings?

777
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,258
<i>All NEST officials clear the floor.</i>

778
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,431
<i>We have 10 minutes</i>
<i>until attempted contact.</i>

779
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,799
We've taken possession
of the five devices

780
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,602
that were hidden in the ship
with Sentinel Prime.

781
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,351
They're some kind of
prototype Autobot technology.

782
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:44,859
They say Sentinel
was the Einstein of his civilization,

783
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,151
so we're gonna keep these locked up

784
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,108
until we know what we're dealing with.

785
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,487
Right now, no one gets access. No one.

786
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,694
This Wang guy recognized me.
He told me to warn you.

787
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,995
He was talking
about the dark side of the moon,

788
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,117
- then they killed him.
- Wait a minute.

789
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,244
- He mentioned the moon?
- Yeah, dark side of the moon.

790
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,917
But why would Decepticons
want to kill humans?

791
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,040
I thought their war was
with the Autobots.

792
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,292
And that is when he made his first
quick-look science report.

793
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,045
That's what we want...

794
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,295
Who's the chick? Okay.

795
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,343
Excuse me! Colonel Lennox?

796
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,842
Director Mearing,
this is Sam Witwicky...

797
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:17,050
I know his name, Colonel.
I wanna know who gave him clearance?

798
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,680
Who gave me clearance?
How about Optimus Prime,

799
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,477
when he touched down in suburbia
looking for my house?

800
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,889
This is the
National Intelligence Director.

801
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,189
In case you...

802
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,272
- H i.
- Disrespecting a federal officer?

803
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,819
Maybe that'll get you somewhere.
Who's she?

804
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,112
She's my girlfriend.

805
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,776
What is this, like, a date?

806
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,487
She knows all about the Autobots, okay?
She knows Bumblebee.

807
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,035
And she comes from a military family.
I can vouch for her.

808
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,785
Hey, I have an idea. How about
we get back to the important topics,

809
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,241
like the fact that I almost had
my face cut off by a Decepticon?

810
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,918
As a taxpayer, I'd like to lodge
a complaint, as a matter of fact.

811
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,085
Okay, listen, all right?

812
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,209
One of the software engineers
at Sam's office was murdered today.

813
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,040
He was involved in NASA's
lunar mapping probe.

814
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,335
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

815
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,463
We cannot entrust national security
to teenagers

816
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,184
unless I missed a policy paper.
Are we doing that now? No. Good.

817
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,935
I don't care who you are.

818
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,811
If you breathe a word of what you
see in here, you will do time for treason.

819
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,936
Do you understand me?

820
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,395
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.
I know them. I don't know you.

821
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,567
You will.

822
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,033
Sentinel Prime.

823
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,532
These things run on Energon,
and he's out of it. He's in a

824
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,030
sort of a sleep mode.

825
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,914
Let us begin.

826
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,588
That's the great Matrix of Leadership.

827
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:38,723
He holds the only thing in the universe
that can repower a Transformer's spark.

828
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,388
This is incredible.

829
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,724
Sentinel Prime,

830
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,223
we bid you return.

831
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,192
Hold your fire!

832
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,993
Stop! Sentinel!

833
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,952
It is I, Optimus Prime!

834
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,909
It is all right. You are safe.

835
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,079
There is nothing to fear.

836
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,208
We are here.

837
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,548
You are home, Sentinel.

838
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,554
The war... The war!

839
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,935
The war was lost.

840
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,398
Cybertron is now
but a barren wasteland.

841
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,647
We have taken refuge here,
on planet Earth.

842
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,274
Its human race is our ally.

843
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,358
My ship. We came under fire.

844
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,694
The pillars. Where are the pillars?

845
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,991
You saved five of them,
including the control pillar.

846
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,370
Only five?

847
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,876
We once had hundreds!

848
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,170
Excuse me, gentlemen.

849
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:54,044
May I ask, what is this technology
you're looking for?

850
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,967
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

851
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,670
Together the pillars
form a space bridge.

852
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,512
I designed, and I alone, can control it.

853
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,558
It defies your laws of physics

854
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,262
to transport matter
through time and space.

855
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:11,349
You're talking
about a teleportation device, aren't you?

856
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,230
Yes, for resources, for refugees.

857
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:18,234
Refugees, or troops of soldiers,
weapons, maybe bombs!

858
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,158
A means of an instant strike!
That's its military function, isn't it?

859
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:25,409
It is our technology
and it must be returned.

860
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,911
Yes. If humans say so.

861
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,961
You can't just bring weapons of
mass destruction into our atmosphere!

862
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,457
You kind of have to clear customs first!

863
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,007
A little formality called paperwork
kind of separates us from the animals.

864
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:40,594
I will overlook your condescending tone

865
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,297
if you heed the gravity of mine.

866
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,680
The Decepticons must never know
the space bridge is here.

867
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,927
For in their hands,

868
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:52,106
it would mean the end of your world.

869
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,687
"Total Nightmare" file.

870
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,608
So, the investigation is open.
We've sent agents to your office.

871
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:01,315
And, for the time being, we're gonna
send you home with Autobot protection.

872
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,567
Who do I need to speak to

873
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,620
to get you guys to understand
that I can help, that I can contribute?

874
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:07,947
Hey, we can all help.
Want to tell you what I know?

875
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,704
I could tell you about the solar system,
all the fun planets to hang out in.

876
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,783
Get off my desk, please.

877
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,586
You pulling out guns?
I can't help you out now. She angry.

878
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,753
Oh, my God.

879
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,456
What do you envision for me?
I go home now?

880
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,542
I go back to work? I make copies?
I mean...

881
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,878
This is a unit
for veteran intelligence officers

882
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,462
and Special Forces,

883
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,718
not for boys
who once owned special cars.

884
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,390
That's a bit harsh, isn't it, ma'am?

885
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,009
Don't call me ma'am. I'm not a ma'am.

886
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,594
Well, you're a woman, aren't you?

887
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,935
So, are those yours?

888
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,982
Yeah. CIA.

889
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:39,107
I only ask 'cause I also have a medal,
from the President.

890
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:42,482
Yeah. Great.
So, it's not that complicated, right?

891
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,158
No one gets to work with the Autobots
unless I approve it.

892
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,610
You're breaking my chain of command.

893
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,661
Come on, let's go.
You've done what you came for.

894
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,664
With all due respect, young man,
I appreciate what you did.

895
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:55,915
But you're not a soldier.

896
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,746
You're a messenger.
You've always been a messenger.

897
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,624
He's a hero.

898
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,182
Bee, you take the freight elevator.
I'll see you up there.

899
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,603
This blows.
That lady officially kicked us out.

900
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,436
Yeah.
Witness Protection Program sucks.

901
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,613
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer
with big yellow and his cannons.

902
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,531
That dog can't protect crap.

903
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,155
Bee?

904
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,791
You miss hanging out?

905
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,126
Yeah, me, too.

906
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,667
That woman,
she called me a messenger.

907
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,378
Can you believe that? After everything
I've done, I'm a messenger.

908
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,215
I believe it. I tell you, Sammy,
we feel the same way.

909
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,015
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

910
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,229
We should do something about it.

911
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:59,479
Bee, I need to know
why they're killing humans.

912
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,561
I say we call in the expert.

913
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,442
<i>My next guest is a former</i>
<i>American intelligence operative</i>

914
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,398
<i>who has dared to speak out</i>

915
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:10,202
<i>regarding our alleged military alliance</i>
<i>with what many describe</i>

916
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,452
<i>as a group</i>
<i>of extraterrestrial mercenaries.</i>

917
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:17,876
<i>He is the author of the bestselling book,</i>
Code-Name Hero.

918
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,086
<i>Former special agent,</i>
<i>Seymour Simmons</i>.

919
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,665
Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.

920
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,625
<i>Now, Agent Simmons,</i>
<i>you would have us believe</i>

921
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,460
<i>that it is in our best interest</i>

922
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:30,139
<i>to formally take sides</i>
<i>in this so-called alien civil war?</i>

923
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,762
Well, the other side wanted to
spank us for breakfast,

924
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,219
so I wouldn't exactly call it a toss-up.

925
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,100
These Decepticons are lethal.

926
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,933
<i>But polls show</i>
<i>half the world would feel safer</i>

927
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,767
<i>with the Autobots completely gone.</i>

928
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,569
<i>Get them out of here!</i>
<i>We don't need them here!</i>

929
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,772
<i>I feel safer when I sleep</i>
<i>with a hand grenade</i>.

930
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,232
<i>Doesn't mean I'm always right.</i>

931
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:51,034

00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:55,743
- Chaz, I'm doing an interview.
- Sorry, Mr. Simmons.

934
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:56,949
Downsized, Bill.

935
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,659
- Budget cuts. Chaz, out.
<i>- Your psych evaluation reports</i>

936
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,461
<i>"severe delusional tendencies."</i>

937
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,708
This is ambush journalism.

938
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,711
<i>You want the truth</i>
<i>about the alien alliance?</i>

939
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:08,636
<i>Buy my book! Buy my book,</i>
<i>before it's too late, people!</i>

940
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,962
<i>You want a piece of me, Bill?</i>

941
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,422
<i>- You want to get naked? I'm ready!</i>
- Wow.

942
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:14,384
<i>- Interview is over! You, out of my house.</i>
<i>- You're sounding like a pinhead, agent.</i>

943
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,218
<i>- And I've got a suggestion for you.</i>
<i>- It's over. Understand?</i>

944
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,519
<i>- Damage control.</i>
- Dutch!

945
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,517
You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons!

946
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,815
You have 23 seconds
to leave the property.

947
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,312
I have called the police!

948
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,894
<i>You are peasant people</i>
<i>throwing rocks at a giant!</i>

949
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,229
What's up next? What have we got?

950
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,651
Book signing, Midtown, noon.

951
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,824
Then we pitch your reality show
to the Discovery Channel.

952
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:34,115
And I have this Witwicky
who keeps calling me.

953
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,241
Five times today.

954
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,492
Kid? What does he want?

955
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,039
I called you
because the Decepticons are back.

956
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,491
I want to know why,
and I need your help.

957
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,827
They're back?

958
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,332
Well, that's good for business.

959
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,334
What if I told you
I know a 50-year-old alien secret

960
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,631
that nobody ever told you.

961
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:52,088
Do not tempt my addiction.
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

962
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,966
- Dutch, is this line secure?
- No.

963
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,516
Don't take the risk.
I'm rich, why should I?

964
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,973
Do not relapse. I won't.

965
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:06,018
Do not let the demons win.

966
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,228
Got it.

967
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,860
What kind of secret?

968
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,117
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.

969
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,320
Future tech. Assassinations.
That kind of stuff.

970
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,530
Apollo.

971
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,953
Dutch!

972
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,793
Tell Megatron, "Let's tango."

973
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,849
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

974
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,565
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

975
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,362
I've wondered what might have been

976
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:55,318
if you had fought the final battle,
instead of me.

977
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,536
Never mourn the past, young warrior.

978
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:02,617
Thanks to you, our race survives.

979
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:07,083
You were our leader, Sentinel.

980
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:10,007
It is your right to lead us again.

981
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,379
In a world I do not know,

982
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:17,431
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.
You are mine.

983
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,645
You've got to break this case down.

984
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,685
What we have here
is an astronaut epidemic.

985
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:29,234
MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident.
Killed. DOA. Car death.

986
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,436
It's like these guys can't drive.

987
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,566
They can fly into outer space,
but they can't drive a car.

988
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:36,567
- Procured your information, Witwicky.
- Thank you, Bruce.

989
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,868
Now,

990
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,705
let me see one right now. One time.

991
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,325
- Quick.
- Very.

992
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,999
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

993
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,630
It says NASA launched it in 2009.

994
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,304
See, forensics show
Wang may have messed with the code,

995
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,972
preventing it from mapping
the far side of the moon,

996
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:00,299
which is also the dark side.

997
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,804
Fucking awesome.

998
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,479
They infiltrate us, intimidate us,
coerce us to do their dirty work.

999
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,430
And once they're done,

1000
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,271
a double-tap to the cerebellum.

1001
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,568
So humans are working
for the Decepticons.

1002
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,234
I don't think
this is about the Decepticons

1003
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,737
looking for something on the moon.

1004
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,036
I think it's about something
they wanted to hide.

1005
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,156
Come to Daddy.

1006
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,373
Come on, throw down.

1007
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,416
Did you eat a lot of paint chips
when you were a kid?

1008
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,043
He's a freak.

1009
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,382
- Like it?
- Get back!

1010
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,762
I'm ticklish!

1011
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:44,347
Sir! We are having a pretty high-level
alien intel confab here

1012
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:47,680
that I don't think you're cleared for,
errand boy.

1013
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,809
Yeah, you're right.

1014
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,312
- It's a bitching robot.
- I think it's time to go, Bruce.

1015
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,940
- Thank you so much for this. And...
- Got to go, Bruce.

1016
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:59,529
I'm smoking over here. Downloading
missing Russian cosmonauts.

1017
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,490
Turns out the Soviets canceled
a manned mission to the moon.

1018
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,454
The moon, in 1972.

1019
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,907
And two of their cosmonauts
went into hiding in America.

1020
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,708
And I just found them alive.

1021
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,001
You're a genius, Brains.

1022
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,342
That was smooth, Bumblebee.

1023
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,635
Missed it by that much.

1024
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,802
Hi.

1025
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,262
Would somebody care to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1026
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,439
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1027
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,063
Who am I? Who is that?
Dutch! Frisk her!

1028
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,564
Certainly.

1029
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,737
No. Dutch.

1030
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,064
Don't touch me.

1031
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,695
- I'm not gonna touch her.
- Sam?

1032
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,575
Angel.

1033
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,946
I was working. I'm sorry about this.

1034
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,578
- Great. We're homeless.
- She lives here? Wow.

1035
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,872
You had your chance to frisk her.

1036
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,954
- I have a girlfriend.
- Really? What's her name?

1037
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,209
India.

1038
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,632
We're supposed to be
at Dylan's party, remember?

1039
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,176
I do remember,
but these are my friends.

1040
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,719
They need me.
I have to be here right now.

1041
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:05,095
So, what, the Autobots and the military,
they can't handle this on their own?

1042
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,426
You know what I liked
about your war stories, Sam?

1043
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,603
It's that they were stories,
they were in the past.

1044
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,429
<i>Look, I know you're thinking</i>
<i>about your brother, okay?</i>

1045
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,107
And you're thinking about your family.
And it's not that situation.

1046
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,183
- No?
- No.

1047
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,020
Why not? Why isn't it, Sam?

1048
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,073
You think we'd rather have his medals,
or we'd rather have him?

1049
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,994
I hear you. I get it.
Where are you taking my bunny? Stop!

1050
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,412
Just stop for a second.

1051
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:28,955
You think I could sleep last night?

1052
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,328
And then it hit me.
No, Sam wants to be in danger.

1053
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,001
- He doesn't know who he is without it.
- I just want to matter.

1054
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,788
You matter to me.

1055
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,296
I know you're worried.
I know you're worried.

1056
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,473
But I promise you, I can handle this.

1057
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,808
Can you? You can promise it?

1058
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,226
I promise.

1059
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,894
Sam, I don't want to lose you,
and I know where this leads.

1060
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,527
I'm not ready for this.

1061
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,655
Are you coming with me?

1062
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,152
I can't.

1063
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,659
Okay.

1064
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,499
Hey.

1065
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,289
Here's your foot.

1066
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,594
The warrior's path is a solitary one.

1067
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,729
How the hell did she afford that car?

1068
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,183
- Her boss.
- Rich bastards!

1069
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,735
I used to hate them. Now, it's...

1070
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,858
Going to a gig on the hunt
for two Russian cosmonauts.

1071
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,068
Nothing like driving in a Maybach.

1072
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,119
Germans know how to make cars,
let me tell you.

1073
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:56,000
My Dutchman,
former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire,

1074
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,327
tracked them down here.

1075
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,672
So, these cosmonauts
went into hiding. Why?

1076
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,125
Bingo. I got a match.

1077
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,052
You're a German Shepherd, Dutch.

1078
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,381
The thing about Russians is,
they never like to talk.

1079
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,218
It's gonna take a little
of the "international language."

1080
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,641
That means "good-bye."

1081
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,077
Stay loose.

1082
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,993
Dutch, give me something tough.

1083
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,997
Baryshnikov.

1084
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,377
We do speak English.

1085
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,167
Dutch, you suck.

1086
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,253
It's a Cyrillic alphabet.

1087
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,340
It's like all the buttons
you never push on a calculator!

1088
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,720
I don't suck.

1089
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,929
Agent Seymour Simmons,
Sector Eight, formerly Seven.

1090
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,981
We know who you are, cosmonautchiks.

1091
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:01,103
So what?

1092
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,152
You were supposed to travel
to the dark side of the moon,

1093
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,946
then it all got shut down.

1094
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,739
The question is, why?

1095
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,833
"Can my child smoke in here?"

1096
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,842
Okay, all right. Okay.

1097
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,132
Go ahead, shoot me.

1098
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,631
I'm willing to die for my country.
Are you?

1099
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,135
Really?

1100
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,887
You are beautiful. Has anyone ever
told you you're beautiful?

1101
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,142
She's a beautiful woman.

1102
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,064
Hey!

1103
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,236
Dutch! Back in the cage.

1104
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,368
Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!

1105
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,329
Control your boy, please.
Control your boy.

1106
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,576
Dutch, stop!

1107
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,372
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.

1108
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,207
Okay, let's everybody just calm down!

1109
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:10,760
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns.
Let's relax. World War II is over.

1110
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,263
You are about to see
one of the biggest Soviet secrets.

1111
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,187
America first to send man to the moon.

1112
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,936
But USSR first to send camera.

1113
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,815
In 1959, our Luna 3

1114
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:31,148
take picture of the dark,
the shadow side.

1115
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,616
Sees nothing.

1116
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,280
But in 1963, Luna 4 sees...

1117
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,491
- Strange rocks.
- Yeah.

1118
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,622
Around the ship. Hundreds of them.

1119
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,453
Yeah, show picture.

1120
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,211
With some drag marks.

1121
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,297
I've seen these.
These aren't rocks, these are pillars.

1122
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,016
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1123
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,344
We know about them
because the Autobots have five of these.

1124
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:04,556
The Decepticons must have raided
the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there,

1125
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:07,063
took the pillars, and hid them.

1126
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,188
It doesn't make sense.

1127
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,270
The Decepticons have the ship.
They have all those pillars.

1128
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:11,445
Why would they leave Sentinel

1129
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,364
when he's the only one
who can use them?

1130
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,241
Unless...

1131
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,576
He's the one thing they still need.

1132
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,872
We've got to meet up with Sentinel,
rendezvous with him and keep him safe.

1133
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,579
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel.
Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1134
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,785
We're coming to NEST now.

1135
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,038
Mr. Witwicky,
I thought I made it clear to you

1136
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,624
that I did not want you
calling this phone.

1137
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,425
<i>Listen, the whole thing has been</i>
<i>a setup since the beginning.</i>

1138
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,629
The Decepticons wanted Optimus
to find Sentinel

1139
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,429
because only Optimus could revive him.

1140
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,257
But we have the space bridge.

1141
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,594
Mearing, you have five pillars.
I just learned that they have hundreds.

1142
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:43,974
<i>You're doing exactly</i>
<i>what they wanted you to do.</i>

1143
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,271
<i>What do you need me to say to you?</i>

1144
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,849
The Decepticons are coming
for Sentinel Prime!

1145
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,107
We're going to NEST.

1146
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,402
<i>We have an Energon alert.</i>

1147
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,859
<i>Energon readings detected</i>
<i>on the D. C. Parkway.</i>

1148
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,871
<i>Currently tracking</i>
<i>three black Suburbans.</i>

1149
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,613
Bee, you got to get Sentinel
out of here! You got to guard him!

1150
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,911
Oh, <i>mein Gott!</i> I'm fired!

1151
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,671
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

1152
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,269
Got you!

1153
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,404
Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!

1154
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,893
Bee, you've got to move faster!
Faster, Bee! Go!

1155
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:52,728
Bee!

1156
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:15,956
All right, back to NEST!

1157
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,927
Dino, I got him!

1158
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,975
Ironhide!

1159
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,341
Is there a problem?

1160
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,883
A little Mexican standoff we got here.

1161
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,806
Weapons down.

1162
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,934
And we'll let you escape
with your dignity.

1163
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,518
Drop them.

1164
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,813
That's good.

1165
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,528
Ironhide, watch out!

1166
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,739
Ironhide, catch!

1167
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,788
Behind you!

1168
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,176
Decepticon punk!

1169
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,928
Class dismissed.

1170
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,566
- Get inside! Let's go!
- Move! Keep moving!

1171
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,860
- Lennox!
- Go, go, go!

1172
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,066
We got Decepticons everywhere.

1173
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,242
I've got my whole team deployed
looking for them. Ironhide!

1174
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,862
Protect Sentinel!
Get him locked up inside!

1175
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,197
Consider it done!

1176
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,577
Hey, you've got to guard him,
'cause he's the key to the whole thing.

1177
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:19,413
Indeed, I am. What you must realize,
my Autobot brothers,

1178
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:22,123
is we were never going to win the war.

1179
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:27,091
For the sake of our planet's survival,
a deal had to be made

1180
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,589
with Megatron.

1181
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:39,311
- Get back!
- What have you done?

1182
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,694
I hereby discharge you from duty.

1183
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:50,947
- Bee!
- Get back!

1184
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,753
Rally all NEST forces back to the base!
Come on!

1185
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:09,837
No...

1186
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:19,646
Get a medic down here!

1187
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:23,226
We don't have enough men!
Do not engage Sentinel!

1188
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,853
Just go to the back gate.

1189
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:31,693
Tak e cover!

1190
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,489
Watch left! Watch left!

1191
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,699
Let's go! Follow me!

1192
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,090
- Director, don't go there!
- Stand down!

1193
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,261
Hey, Sentinel!

1194
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,051
- Director!
- What is going on?

1195
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,427
What do you think you are doing?

1196
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,721
I am a Prime!

1197
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,182
I do not take orders from you.

1198
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:04,608
Director Mearing, come on.

1199
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,481
We can't fight him. Let's go.
We have to go.

1200
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,030
Now return what belongs to me!

1201
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:13,567
Oh, my God!

1202
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,967
- You guys okay?
- Is everybody out?

1203
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,340
Everybody, stay calm.
You're gonna be fine.

1204
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:45,100
Yeah, take a look, Optimus!
This is all on you!

1205
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,185
Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.

1206
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:52,524
Come on, let's go.
All right, notify the 101St Airborne!

1207
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,950
We need to hunt this thing down!

1208
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,287
Carly!

1209
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:07,288
Hot from our little campfire.

1210
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,419
S'mores. Isn't that great?

1211
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,341
We're really living off the land.

1212
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,212
Mom, Dad, have you guys seen
Carly come home yet?

1213
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,464
Excuse me. Can you knock, please?
This is our bedroom.

1214
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:17,673
Why wouldn't she be at home?

1215
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:20,764
We had a fight
and we might have broken up,

1216
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:21,935
or be on a break. I don't really know.

1217
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,230
- What? No.
- Look, I can't talk about it right now.

1218
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,558
I can't go into details, Mom.
I have to find her.

1219
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,610
Sit down. We're having
a family meeting. Family meeting!

1220
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,895
You may not know this,

1221
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,402
but your father and I
were not always this perfectly happy.

1222
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,902
You know, there was a time
in our marriage

1223
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,655
when I thought
this was not gonna work out.

1224
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,699
- Can we please not?
- She's damaging him.

1225
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,372
You break up with
one world-class hottie...

1226
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:42,949
No. Stop. Stop, okay? She dumped me,

1227
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,035
I moved on to something better.
That's it. I'm a happier person.

1228
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,118
The second beautiful girl,
and you lose her.

1229
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,202
Why don't you help me?

1230
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,622
- They had an argument.
- One fight.

1231
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,584
You're not gonna get a third one,
I mean, unless you have like a big...

1232
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,918
What the... Ma!

1233
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:56,425
Maybe you just don't know
what you're doing.

1234
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,597
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.
- You need the book.

1235
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,720
- Tell him about the book.
- You're always wrong. Get used to it.

1236
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,597
Okay. You've gotta read this.
<i>She Comes First.</i>

1237
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,724
- There's some killer shit in here.
- No. No.

1238
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:07,272
- That's it, I'm going.
- No! No!

1239
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,938
Sit down, sit down! Back me up!

1240
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,736
- Happy wife, happy life.
- Heck yeah.

1241
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:16,281
Unhappy wife, stone-cold misery
for the rest of your...

1242
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:17,609
- Stop.
- It's true.

1243
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,864
All I'm saying is, do you love this girl?

1244
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,534
- She's the one.
- Then you gotta go get her.

1245
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,911
I mean, your dad and I,
when we had troubles,

1246
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,664
he moved heaven and earth to find me.

1247
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:30,337
Say what you said. Say it.

1248
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:33,040
"I will follow you to the end of time."

1249
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:34,632
Does that suck or what?

1250
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,631
- It's like a bad sci-fi film.
- No. It is so sweet.

1251
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,093
I want you to get out of the city. You get
as far away from here as you can.

1252
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,423
You understand?

1253
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:42,758
I love you.

1254
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:06,366
My master! Such a brilliant scheme!

1255
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,624
So when Sentinel left Cybertron,
it was to defect?

1256
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:14,415
He was meant to rendezvous
with me here on Earth

1257
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,751
before fate waylaid us both.

1258
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,636
The only way to revive him,

1259
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:22,591
we needed Prime and his Matrix.

1260
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,759
Excellent strategy.

1261
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,811
Mine, mine!

1262
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,775
So he is now your partner, master?

1263
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:43,452
He is my greatest triumph.

1264
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,824
So impressive.

1265
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,407
Commencing transport.

1266
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,330
Stop! No! No, Sentinel!

1267
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:51,877
Forgive me.

1268
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,841
Here we are.

1269
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,793
Fight us now.

1270
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:39,833
Contact!

1271
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,965
Watch out! Move it! Move it!

1272
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,345
Autobots, retreat!

1273
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,041
Why, Sentinel, why?

1274
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:19,169
For Cybertron! For our home!

1275
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:24,800
What war destroyed, we can rebuild!
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1276
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:29,975
No, it's not the only way. This is our
home! We must defend the humans!

1277
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,428
So lost you are, Optimus.

1278
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,559
On Cybertron, we were gods.

1279
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,142
And here, they call us machines.

1280
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,946
Let the humans serve us, or perish.

1281
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:49,245
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
In time you'll see.

1282
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,407
It's not over.

1283
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:59,251
Now, if I were him, I wouldn't let you
out of my sight for one second.

1284
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,417
It's funny. I was just thinking
on the way over here,

1285
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,548
I could really use some advice
from Dylan, and there he is.

1286
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,175
- Can I speak to you, Carly?
- Welcome. Please, sit down.

1287
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,381
Have a drink.

1288
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,725
You know what, I don't need a drink.
Or a car, or a job.

1289
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,222
I just need to speak
to my girlfriend alone.

1290
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,599
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

1291
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,102
Excuse me.

1292
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:23,153
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you outside.

1293
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,443
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1294
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,116
I remember a talk I had
with my dad once about tough choices.

1295
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,035
Yeah, now's not the time.
We'll set something up, though.

1296
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,363
Of course, it was way back,
when my dad's firm was in charge

1297
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,165
of budget review
and accounting for NASA.

1298
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:37,873
You see,
the thing that he taught me was,

1299
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:41,126
when it's not your war,
you join the side that's going to win.

1300
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,082
Move.

1301
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,634
Too direct? Or is it just me?

1302
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:46,756
Certainly not you, sir.

1303
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:01,851
You're mine!

1304
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,648
No!

1305
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,615
- Get help!
- Sam, I can't get out!

1306
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,150
- Someone get help!
- Good night!

1307
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,281
Good night, Mr. Dylan.

1308
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:13,363
Get me out of here!

1309
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,084
Help! Get help!

1310
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,163
- He's young. He will learn. Good night.
- Get me out!

1311
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,505
It was a fun night.

1312
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:28,298
You really think you're the first man ever
asked to join the noble alien cause?

1313
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:29,720
Who are you?

1314
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:32,890
Do you know why we've not been back
to the moon since 1972?

1315
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,800
Because these two,

1316
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,932
they came to my dad and they told him
to do some creative accounting.

1317
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,605
Make it way too expensive
to ever go back. So, he and the others

1318
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,025
shut down the American
and Russian space programs.

1319
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,103
And they've been our clients ever since.

1320
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,859
- You helped them kill people?
- You think they'd give you a choice?

1321
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,653
Besides, it's not
like I personally participated.

1322
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,779
I am a liaison. I liaise.

1323
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:56,705
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

1324
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,535
Sam!

1325
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,589
- Sam!
- Let her go!

1326
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,837
Sam!

1327
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,880
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.

1328
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,014
You're the one spy
I've never been able to provide

1329
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,558
as someone close to the Autobots.

1330
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,226
Sam! Don't do what he wants!

1331
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,933
Yes, he will.

1332
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,063
They all do.

1333
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,563
They will slaughter her,
you understand me?

1334
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:33,196
In the time it takes you to blink,
they'll do it to her and they'll do it to me.

1335
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,073
So you show a little respect

1336
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,405
when someone offers you a job!

1337
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,036
Wrist.

1338
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,292
You are to track down Optimus Prime,

1339
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,244
because you're the one human
he trusts,

1340
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,876
and you will ask one question.

1341
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:50,005
How does he intend to fight back?
Strategies, tactics, everything!

1342
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:58,183
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it?
It's very high-tech.

1343
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,807
It lets us see what you see,
hear what you hear

1344
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:02,229
and it taps your nervous system.

1345
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,682
So, if you so much as try and signal...

1346
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,610
I don't know what to tell you, Sam.

1347
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,734
Relationships have consequences.
I am here because of my father.

1348
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,235
She is here because of you.

1349
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,120
Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

1350
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:19,989
Soundwave, would you please?

1351
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,211
Sam, do your job.

1352
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,123
She'll be safe. I give you my word.

1353
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:34,461
I'll kill you. You have my word.

1354

<i>Combatant Commands</i>

Yeah, I really don't see

I have underestimated you at every turn.

1375
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,355
What?

1376
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,281
You warned us
that they were using humans.

1377
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,029
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

Are you all right?

1381
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,499
Yes.

1382
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,963
- No, you're not. You're sweating.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1383
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,169
I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

1384
01:22:57,264 --> 01:22:59,346
I'm nervous because you got me
in here with this information.

1385
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:00,718
Okay, I'm a Twitter junkie.
I blog everything.

01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,696
<i>In the words</i>
<i>of the House Majority Leader,</i>

1396
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,531
<i>the sponsor of today's resolution,</i>

1397
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:27,787
<i>- "We cannot in good conscience...</i>. <i>"</i>
- Okay.

1398
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,584
What? They can't do this.

1399
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,629
- You gotta tell them. They can't do that.
- Okay. It's official. It's a go, people.

1400
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:35,002
These are our allies. The Autobots
fought for us. They fought with us.

1401
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,128
And where are we now?

1402
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,756
Facing an enemy invasion

1403
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,508
with an enemy that has the means
to deploy countless more.

1404
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,517
If there is any more you know,

1405
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:48,095
anything at all
about the enemy's intentions,

1406
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:50,768
now is the time to tell.

1407
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,941
Autobots have no way
of leaving this planet.

1408
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,936
And that is where you're wrong.

1409
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,981
<i>Its name is the</i> Xanthium.

1410
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,028
<i>It brought the second wave of Autobots</i>

1411
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,610
<i>and it's been under NASA 's care</i>
<i>and study ever since.</i>

1412
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,196
<i>We linked it</i>
<i>with a decommissioned shuttle</i>

1413
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,953
<i>to maintain military control</i>
<i>until they're gone</i>.

1414
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:13,162
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque
on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not 19!

1415
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:15,623
You're gonna risk the lives
of all me mates! I'll ball you!

1416
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:19,217
These guys are the Wreck ers.
They take care of the <i>Xanthium.</i>

1417
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,386
We don't let them off the base much,
'cause they're assholes.

1418
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,509
You gotta pull that, ya nancy swanker!

1419
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,056
It's time to kill him!

1420
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:27,054
I'm just trying to help, you know.
Just doing my job.

1421
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,602
Just calm down. Leave him alone.
This is a human being.

1422
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,772
- Epps!
- You are ridiculous!

1423
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:33,098
- Is that you?
- What up, man?

1424
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:34,979
What are you doing here?

1425
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,651
I retired from the Air Force.

1426
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:38,486
Can you let my hand go?

1427
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,031
What the hell was that?

1428
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,408
Now I just consult
to run interference for them.

1429
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:44,735
Well, you're not helping!

1430
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,118
No more combat and aliens shooting
at my ass. I got a dream job.

1431
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,119
Time to get off this planet.

1432
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,577
Kicking the Autobots out.
Can you believe this is happening?

1433
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,171
- Where do you think it's taking them?
- Any planet but here.

1434
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,719
I wanna talk
to whoever's in charge here!

1435
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:07,516
Well, well, well. Charlotte Mearing.

1436
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,265
Agent Simmons.
Former Agent Simmons.

1437
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,596
So I see you survived Washington.

1438
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:16,650
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.
I survive. I will survive.

1439
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:21,022
They're bringing everybody in, kid.
Putting all the intel on the table.

1440
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:26,406
And if you think deporting nine Autobots
is gonna solve a damn thing...

1441
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:27,736
It's out of my hands.

1442
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,280
Moving up in the world?

1443
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,372
Your booty looks excellent.

1444
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,255
If you ever say a word to anyone

1445
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:40,879
about what happened
that night in Quantico,

1446
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,751
I'll cut your heart out.

1447
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:44,878
You already did.

1448
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:48,636
Sammy, listen to me.
Don't let them exile us.

1449
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:51,434
- Don't let them take us, Sam.
- It's a Decepticon trap.

1450
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,266
Check the nitrogen levels.
We're booking out of here.

1451
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:34,928
Optimus?

1452
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:39,601
What your leaders say is true.
This was all my fault.

1453
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:44,317
I told them whom to trust.
I was so wrong.

1454
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,945
That doesn't make it your fault.
It just makes you human for a change.

1455
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,825
Remember this.

1456
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,779
You may lose your faith in us,

1457
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:55,449
but never in yourselves.

1458
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,332
I need to know
how you're gonna fight back.

1459
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,670
I know this is strategy,
I know you're coming back

1460
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,676
with reinforcements, something.
I know there's a plan.

1461
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,312
You can tell me.
No other human will ever know.

1462
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,477
There is no plan.

1463
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,611
If we just do what they want,
how are we gonna live with ourselves?

1464
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:28,652
You are my friend, Sam.

1465
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,151
You always will be.

1466
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,158
But your leaders have spoken.

1467
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,415
From here,

1468
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,627
the fight will be your own.

1469
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,517
Make it short.

1470
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:57,727
We're loading up.

1471
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:02,357
All right, hustle up!
We're launching at dawn.

1472
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:09,406
We're gonna do whatever we can.
Make it like it was.

1473
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:12,735
You will always be my friend, Sam.

1474
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,161
I gotta be going on.

1475
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,753
Years from now, they're gonna ask us,

1476
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:35,215
"Where were you
when they took over the planet?"

1477
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,844
We're gonna say,

1478
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:42,389
"We just stood by and watched."

1479
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:58,739
You should really look at this
as a partnership.

1480
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,329
You have to stand
on the side of progress

1481
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:02,875
if you wanna be a part of history.

1482
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,676
<i>Seven, six, five,</i>

1483
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:21,596
<i>four, three, two,</i>

1484
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,601
<i>one, zero.</i>

1485
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,531
<i>Go ahead and throttle up.</i>

1486
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,884
You wanted an answer. You got one.

1487
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:56,509
<i>I always get what I want, Sam.</i>
<i>We just needed to be sure</i>.

1488
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,305
Sure of what?

1489
01:29:58,435 --> 01:29:59,641
That they would go without a fight.

1490
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,153
<i>- Say again.</i>
<i>- Tracking an incoming object.</i>

1491
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,241
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1492
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,336
I need your help to track a phone call.
There's a man on this phone.

1493
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,463
He's the head of their human operations
and he has Carly hostage.

1494
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:18,385
I want you to sit down. Don't move.

1495
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:21,802
Follow me.

1496
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,263
I'm watching him drive up right now.

1497
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,814
The call was placed en route.

1498
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:32,142
I'm hacking into
the phone's camera now.

1499
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,606
There, that's it.
That's a live stream from the camera.

1500
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:37,030
Someplace... Hold on.
I can triangulate this.

1501
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,404
Okay, it's Chicago cell sites.
There, I've got it.

1502
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:43,202
Trump Tower, Chicago.
Lower penthouse.

1503
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:44,704
We're on.

1504
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:48,783
- I'm going.
- You sure?

1505
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:51,585
She's done nothing but try to help me,
and I can be there in 15 hours.

1506
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:53,914
You're not going alone.

1507
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,885
I still got my NEST friends out there.

1508
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:00,883
I'll round them up,
we'll find your girlfriend,

1509
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,305
we're gonna bring this guy in.

1510
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,965
Why are you helping me?

1511
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,306
'Cause that asshole
killed my friends, too.

1512
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:26,788
They said they were here for
our resources, to rebuild their planet.

1513
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:30,117
Yes, but really
one resource in particular.

1514
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:32,202
One unique to our planet.

1515
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:35,208
Us?

1516
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:38,713
You're very smart.

1517
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:41,044
You see, they can't rebuild
without a slave labor force.

1518
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:44,881
How many rocks up there in
the universe offer six billion workers?

1519
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:48,139
What are you talking about?
We can't transport people.

1520
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,642
They're not shipping people.
They're shipping their planet here.

1521
01:32:57,655 --> 01:32:59,065
Oh, my God.

1522
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:01,731
What's Sentinel doing here?

1523
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:05,569
Watch. They're spreading hundreds of
pillars around the globe right now.

1524
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:08,245
In just a few hours,
they're gonna launch them into orbit

1525
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:11,575
and bring Cybertron
into our atmosphere.

1526
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:13,785
The red one there controls the rest.

1527
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,916
He triggers that,
it starts the whole thing.

1528
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:19,875
Be gone, insect operative.
Your work is done.

1529
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:22,339
Your Excellency. He's such a dick.

1530
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,135
- You want this to happen?
- I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1531
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,892
You think I asked for this?
I inherited a client.

1532
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:35,598
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here
and we're all their slaves,

1533
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:37,308
I guess they'll still need a human leader.

1534
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:39,735
Don't jinx me.
You want to survive, you listen to me.

1535
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:01,630
It is time for the slaves of Earth
to recognize their masters.

1536
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:03,334
Seal off the city.

1537
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:01,109
Get the dogs outta here now!
Get them in the back!

1538
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:04,775
I guess they didn't tell you about
this part, did they?

1539
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,198
You think I'm at every meeting?

1540
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:09,526
Look, I'm safe.

1541
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:10,952
They said I was safe.

1542
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:23,710
Let's roll!

1543
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:31,965
We had a signal earlier.

1544
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,891
It's not working.

1545
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:42,643
<i>This is a national emergency broadcast.</i>

1546
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:50,942
<i>Chicago has suffered a massive attack.</i>

1547
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,795
Wrong way!

1548
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,291
Get out of here! Go back!

1549
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,850
<i>There is a ring of alien ships</i>
<i>around Chicago.</i>

1550
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,525
Our high-range bombers
were just knocked out of the sky.

1551
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:27,570
<i>They can 't get through</i>
<i>enemy air defenses over the city.</i>

1552
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:29,113
<i>Our satellites have been jammed.</i>

1553
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,407
<i>We have no way to monitor</i>
<i>the enemy's movement.</i>

1554
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:34,361
<i>Our old NEST teams are on stand-down</i>
<i>holding at Grissom Air Force Base</i>.

1555
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,070
We're about 10 minutes from
the battle zone.

1556
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,828
We have Special Forces
trying to gain access to the city,

1557
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:40,783
<i>and infantry is staging at the perimeter.</i>

1558
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:43,540
Excuse me, excuse me,
it just doesn't make sense!

1559
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,122
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1560
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,003
They keep shooting down our drones.

1561
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:49,425
<i>They want us blind.</i>

1562
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,591
<i>But we do have</i>
<i>a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.</i>

1563
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,968
Well, whoever's manning
these UAV drones,

1564
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:57,015
can we try to redirect them
toward Trump Tower?

1565
01:36:57,103 --> 01:36:59,469
The kid, Witwickety,
was on his way to Chicago.

1566
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:03,640
Said some point-man human op is there
for the Decepticons!

1567
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:05,812
Listen, if I know anything, I know this,

1568
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:09,020
that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet.

1569
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,695
My God.

1570
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:55,279
We came here to find her
in the middle of all that?

1571
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,782
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1572
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,203
I'm not going in there.

1573
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,622
No one's going in.

1574
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:09,543
I am.

1575
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:12,462
With or without you, I'll find her.

1576
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:16,713
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.
Is that what you want?

1577
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,339
Is that what you want?

1578
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:21,513
You came all the way out here
to get yourself killed? Huh?

1579
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:22,639
Listen to what I'm saying.

1580
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,470
She's here because of me.
Do you understand?

1581
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:28,308
Listen, if you go in this building,
that's if she's even still alive,

1582
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:29,768
there's no way
you're gonna be able to reach her!

1583
01:38:29,862 --> 01:38:31,693
What do you suggest I do?

1584
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:34,155
It's over.

1585
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:37,905
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1586
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:39,653
No.

1587
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,537
Incoming!

1588
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:31,207
We will kill them all.

1589
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:38,048
Wreck ers, kill him!

1590
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,805
This is going to hurt!

1591
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,929
A lot!

1592
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,187
Your leaders will now understand.

1593
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:55,566
Decepticons will never leave
your planet alone.

1594
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:59,487
And we needed them to believe
we had gone.

1595
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,990
For today, in the name of freedom,

1596
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,412
we take the battle to them!

1597
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,601
- I saw your ship blow up!
- The ship?

1598
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:35,227
We were never in the ship!
We designed the damn thing, didn't we?

1599
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:38,358
We were hidden
in the first booster rocket to separate.

1600
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:42,067
Splashed down back in the Atlantic,
just as planned.

1601
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:43,776
We ain't going nowhere.

1602
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:46,780
Yeah, no one's exiling us.

1603
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:52,918
The Autobots are staying right here.
We're gonna help you win this war.

1604
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:56,130
They're surrounding the city
to make a fortress

1605
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:59,459
so that no one can see
what they're up to inside.

1606
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:03,092
Our only chance
is the element of surprise.

1607
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,843
I think I know where to look!

1608
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:09,685
<i>Mini-drone is on approach</i>
<i>to Trump Tower.</i>

1609
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,311
You're telling me
Sam's headed into that?

1610
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,067
Poor kid.

1611
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,571
Probably never got close.

1612
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,440
So, you can fly this thing, right?

1613
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:26,202
What is that... What is that?
What is that? So-so?

1614
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:29,663
So you so-so can fly this.
That feels terrible.

1615
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:33,250
We're right behind you.

1616
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:41,425
All right, we're going in!

1617
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:09,283
The city is secure.

1618
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:12,331
The humans cannot stop us.

1619
01:42:12,418 --> 01:42:14,750
As the afternoon falls,

1620
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:18,125
the rest of the pillars
will reach their launch position.

1621
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:23,050
This is the victory I promised you
so many years ago,

1622
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:28,055
where we rebuild Cybertron together!

1623
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:31,267
I have deigned to work with you

1624
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:34,808
that our planet may survive!

1625
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:38,232
I will never work for you!

1626
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:41,777
You would be wise
to remember the difference.

1627
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:06,252
I'm so sick of this.
I'm just sick of waiting.

1628
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:10,757
Where is she?

1629
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,390
Where is she?

1630
01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:15,261
You've got some balls.

1631
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:28,782
No, Sam!

1632
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:34,573
No! No, no!

1633
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:39,702
Carly!

1634
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,250
Carly!

1635
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,292
Jump!

1636
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,245
Bee, fire!

1637
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:23,955
Bee!

1638
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:49,780
Autobots! They're alive!

1639
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,693
Decepticons, defend the pillar!

1640
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:59,540
Raise the bridges! Find them!

1641
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:15,593
Sam.

1642
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:18,676
You found me.

1643
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:20,102
I'd follow you anywhere.

1644
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:35,242
Form a perimeter! Let's go, let's go!

1645
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:36,660
Well, you're crazy.

1646
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:39,954
What is that? Is that us?

1647
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,868
This thing's a military UAV.
Stone, check and see if it's still working.

1648
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:45,373
Yeah, it's still got power.

1649
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:46,829
Flight Control, do you copy?

1650
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:49,544
Can... Can you rotate?
Can you do something?

1651
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:51,258
I think we got something.

1652
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:53,085
Epps! We got Epps!

1653
01:45:54,139 --> 01:45:55,925
<i>Come on, work! Work!</i>

1654
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,301
All right, turn the volume up on that!

1655
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:58,716
The kid!

1656
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:00,927
<i>Can you rotate or something?</i>

1657
01:46:02,064 --> 01:46:04,851
Yes, yes! Okay, okay, okay.
They can see us.

1658
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:06,682
<i>Chicago is ground zero,</i>
<i>do you understand?</i>

1659
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:09,189
<i>- Can you hear us? You understand?</i>
- Witwicky.

1660
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,645
<i>Please listen. Sentinel Prime is here</i>

1661
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,195
<i>and he has the pillars</i>
<i>to his space bridge</i>.

1662
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,773
They're on top of a building
on Chicago River.

1663
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:15,278
It's owned by
Hotchkiss Gould Investments.

1664
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:18,156
<i>Now, the pillar that controls everything</i>
<i>is in the southeast cupola</i>.

1665
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,662
<i>You've got to destroy the pillar.</i>
<i>You have to shoot down the pillar</i>

1666
01:46:20,749 --> 01:46:22,956
<i>or they're going to transport</i>
<i>Cybertron here, do you understand?</i>

1667
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:24,579
<i>- Do you understand?</i>
- What?

1668
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:28,379
Give me a G PS on the building
and on that drone! Let's go!

1669
01:46:28,465 --> 01:46:30,421
Mensurate those coordinates.
Shorten the kill chain.

1670
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:32,257
Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.

1671
01:46:32,344 --> 01:46:33,379
<i>The southeast cupola.</i>

1672
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,755
All right!

1673
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:38,297
We need to move
before the fighters spot us.

1674
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,633
Wait here until we scout a route ahead.

1675
01:46:40,978 --> 01:46:42,809
- Let's roll.
- Ratchet, cover high.

1676
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:46,688
Hey, think we could use that rock et
to shoot down the pillar?

1677
01:46:46,775 --> 01:46:49,437
We're eight blocks away.
We got to get closer to take a shot.

1678
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,649
Not closer. Higher.
We need a clear line of sight.

1679
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:55,815
And it's across the river. Gonna have
a hell of a time trying to sneak up.

1680
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:57,566
We only got one shot.

1681
01:46:58,662 --> 01:47:00,323
One shot's all we need.

1682
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:03,743
We got to be able to see
around that building from the ground.

1683
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:06,667
Get NSA to send service specs for
any cameras in that area.

1684
01:47:06,754 --> 01:47:07,789
Maybe some are working.

1685
01:47:08,213 --> 01:47:11,000
Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.

1686
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:14,212
Listen up. You want to hit back?

1687
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:18,546
We're gonna have to wingsuit in.
It's the only way to get close.

1688
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:22,262
I can't promise anyone a ride home,
but if you're with me,

1689
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:24,681
the world needs you now.

1690
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,680
I'll find my own ride home, sir.

1691
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:31,642
Who else?

1692
01:47:34,907 --> 01:47:36,022
General Morshower,

1693
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:38,607
requesting diversionary action
to the south of the city.

1694
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:41,034
<i>We're coming north and low</i>.
<i>You guys drive them to the east.</i>

1695
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,262
Autobot victory! Autobot victory!

1696
01:48:32,715 --> 01:48:35,548
That is one scary-ass Decepticon!

1697
01:48:35,634 --> 01:48:39,627
They got my trailer.
I need that flight tech.

1698
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:44,261
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.
Wreck ers,

1699
01:48:44,977 --> 01:48:46,683
we need a diversion.

1700
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:49,432
- Let's get some!
- You got that right.

1701
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:52,682
Listen, we're gonna circle around
to that glass building.

1702
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:54,732
And we'll get high enough
to make the rocket shot

1703
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:56,360
while you guys draw his fire.

1704
01:48:56,447 --> 01:48:57,937
- Let's move!
- Wait a minute!

1705
01:48:58,032 --> 01:49:01,365
I'm not letting you go out there
without my urban combat prototypes.

1706
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:03,113
- We got to go, Que!
- Come on.

1707
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:05,201
They're great inventions for kicking ass!

1708
01:49:05,289 --> 01:49:06,369
What are these?

1709
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:10,200
Those are boom-sticks.
Armed in 30 seconds.

1710
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,000
Grapple gloves, for climbing.

1711
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:14,411
Go, go! Move your ass! Move, move!

1712
01:49:14,506 --> 01:49:17,088
Move, move! Go, go, go!

1713
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:24,133
- Move, move!
- Let's go!

1714
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:37,601
Let's go! Run!

1715
01:49:44,953 --> 01:49:46,363
- Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
- No, no, no!

1716
01:49:46,455 --> 01:49:48,946
- Where you going?
- Stop, stop, stop! Don't leave!

1717
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:52,875
You never leave a 'bot behind!
Shockwave's coming!

1718
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:58,748
Go for the stairs!

1719
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,457
Epps, this way!

1720
01:50:01,887 --> 01:50:03,627
<i>Breaking right.</i>

1721
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:05,053
<i>Bead. Rolling in.</i>

1722
01:50:10,187 --> 01:50:11,302
We got another one coming around.

1723
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:13,478
Coming around on the left side,
coming around on the right side.

1724
01:50:13,565 --> 01:50:15,931
We're going to use Willis Tower
for cover!

1725
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:17,891
Once we make altitude, we jump!

1726
01:50:17,986 --> 01:50:20,898
- A lot of airplanes out here!
- Contact off the nose.

1727
01:50:23,242 --> 01:50:24,652
<i>Mayday! I don't think</i>
<i>he's gonna make it</i>.

1728
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:27,359
<i>- Mayday, mayday! Six-one going down.</i>
- Heads up! Heads up!

1729
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:33,373
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1730
01:50:42,594 --> 01:50:45,006
<i>- Tally on the left.</i>
<i>- Got him.</i>

1731
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:49,302
Here we go! Here we go!

1732
01:50:49,601 --> 01:50:51,011
Keep it tight!

1733
01:50:51,103 --> 01:50:52,218
<i>Coming around.</i>

1734
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:54,428
All right, focus, focus, focus.

1735
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:01,184
<i>Threat above tower, six o'clock!</i>

1736
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,565
Locusts!

1737
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,317
<i>Look out! Breaking right! Breaking right!</i>

1738
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:09,701
<i>- Watch out, watch out!</i>
<i>- Holy shit!</i>

1739
01:51:11,748 --> 01:51:13,158
Look out, look out, look out!

1740
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:14,410
Get them out, get them out,
get them out!

1741
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:16,742
- Everybody out, out, out!
- Jump, jump, jump!

1742
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:25,049
Get out, get out!

1743
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:26,172
I'm stuck!

1744
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:28,212
<i>Now. Get them out now!</i>
<i>Get them out now!</i>

1745
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,589
Help!

1746
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:52,786
<i>Get separation</i>.
<i>Track away, track away!</i>

1747
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:14,800
Hard left! Hard left!

1748
01:52:16,063 --> 01:52:18,019
Six hundred feet.

1749
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,116
Check your six! Check your six!

1750
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:38,582
He's on our ass! Watch out, watch out!

1751
01:52:42,673 --> 01:52:43,708
<i>Sharp right!</i>

1752
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:50,506
<i>Building dead ahead!</i>

1753
01:52:50,806 --> 01:52:52,137
Thread the needle!

1754
01:53:01,692 --> 01:53:03,353
Pull, pull!

1755
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,354
- Come on, we're high enough!
- This is a mother getting up here!

1756
01:53:08,448 --> 01:53:10,234
- Get your fat ass over here!
- I'm coming.

1757
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,951
Set up the rocket!

1758
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:20,866
- They're coming.
- Weapons status?

1759
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:23,043
29 Bot-busters, 20 piercing D-Bot.

1760
01:53:25,382 --> 01:53:28,624
There, the building with the dome.

1761
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:32,294
For our brothers,
let's make this trip worth it.

1762
01:53:35,434 --> 01:53:36,469
Oh, God.

1763
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:40,844
The building!

1764
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:46,732
They're shooting at the building!

1765
01:53:50,032 --> 01:53:51,112
This is not a good idea.

1766
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:52,814
- What?
- This is not a good idea.

1767
01:53:52,909 --> 01:53:54,365
- This building is unstable.
- Listen, stop for a second.

1768
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:56,489
If we don't do what we came to do,
it doesn't matter, we all die.

1769
01:53:56,621 --> 01:53:58,612
Right? That's your target.
Come on, man!

1770
01:53:58,749 --> 01:54:00,489
I don't even care
if the building collapses.

1771
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:02,074
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

1772
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:05,327
The building is going over!

1773
01:54:05,422 --> 01:54:06,753
- Hang on!
- Tak e cover!

1774
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,084
Keep your hands up!

1775
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:25,935
It's okay! It stopped!

1776
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:27,857
Guys, look!

1777
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:30,606
- Incoming, incoming!
- Everybody hide!

1778
01:54:58,767 --> 01:55:01,053
Don't move.

1779
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:07,480
Go, go.

1780
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:15,526
Run!

1781
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:17,153
Cover fire!

1782
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:22,863
Shoot the glass! Jump out the window!

1783
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:30,419
Jump!

1784
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:49,848
We're gonna die!

1785
01:55:51,403 --> 01:55:53,268
Sam, I can't stop!

1786
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:55,562
Shoot the glass!

1787
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:22,304
Sam!

1788
01:56:47,792 --> 01:56:50,124
Is everybody okay?

1789
01:56:50,212 --> 01:56:51,247
You okay?

1790
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:52,669
What the hell was that?

1791
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:55,881
Driller-bot is thirsty.

1792
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:01,253
- This evil thing's looking at me!
- What?

1793
01:57:14,277 --> 01:57:16,484
It's even got an uglier
Decepticon with it!

1794
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,811
We have to evac!

1795
01:57:36,424 --> 01:57:40,133
- Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!
- We're trapped!

1796
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:42,844
Okay. How do we get out of here?
Hey! Come on!

1797
01:57:42,931 --> 01:57:45,217
Oh, Lord Jesus,
let me just get out of this alive.

1798
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:57,733
Move! We got to move!

1799
01:57:57,821 --> 01:57:59,937
Why do the Decepticons
always get the good shit?

1800
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:01,862
- Move!
- We're about to be eaten, people!

1801
01:58:24,389 --> 01:58:26,175
We're gonna die!

1802
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:44,280
- Hold on!
- Give me your hand!

1803
01:58:44,451 --> 01:58:45,941
- I'm swinging that way!
- Got her!

1804
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,572
Oh, my God!

1805
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:50,028
I'm dropping you on the fire escape!

1806
01:59:07,432 --> 01:59:08,467
Sam!

1807
01:59:09,726 --> 01:59:11,591
We gotta move!

1808
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:27,611
I'm coming for you!

1809
02:00:22,549 --> 02:00:23,880
Optimus!

1810
02:00:23,967 --> 02:00:26,629
- Wreckers!
- We're coming!

1811
02:00:27,804 --> 02:00:30,671
Decepticons around the world,

1812
02:00:30,765 --> 02:00:32,721
launch the pillars.

1813
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:06,085
We are so lost!

1814
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:07,507
Always left out.

1815
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:10,418
Ka-ching!

1816
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,339
It's time to lay down the law.

1817
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:15,970
About to bring some hurt now.

1818
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:26,355
It's starting! You see it?

1819
02:01:29,574 --> 02:01:31,235
Look out!

1820
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:41,123
Where are Sam and Carly?

1821
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:44,919
We'll go this way.

1822
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:53,381
I give you one thing to do,

1823
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:55,429
one thing to do,
and you drop the ball on that?

1824
02:01:55,517 --> 02:01:57,132
I ain't signed up for all this!

1825
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:59,434
Got aliens blasting at me,
running around, chasing me!

1826
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:01,762
I'm ducking through churches and
buildings and all that kind of crap!

1827
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:04,814
This is bullshit!
I ain't signed up for this, Epps.

1828
02:02:04,901 --> 02:02:06,061
I'm trying to keep it together.

1829
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:13,865
- What a treat! You and me, alone!
- Carly!

1830
02:02:19,249 --> 02:02:20,739
Come on, come on! Run!

1831
02:02:23,169 --> 02:02:25,956
Okay. He's after me, not you.

1832
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:27,920
Run!

1833
02:02:29,425 --> 02:02:31,837
You can't hide, boy!

1834
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:39,007
I just love it when
your little insect feet try to run!

1835
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,558
- Sam!
- Run!

1836
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:48,100
I thought you were working for us, boy?

1837
02:02:52,115 --> 02:02:54,652
No! Sam!

1838
02:03:04,127 --> 02:03:05,742
My eye!

1839
02:03:18,057 --> 02:03:19,593
My eye!

1840
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:24,761
Target the Decepticon!

1841
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:33,027
Sam!

1842
02:03:37,994 --> 02:03:39,359
Please, you've got to save Sam!

1843
02:03:39,454 --> 02:03:40,864
- You've got to save him!
- What the hell is he doing?

1844
02:03:44,417 --> 02:03:45,998
This better work.

1845
02:03:46,127 --> 02:03:48,209
D-Bots! D-Bots!

1846
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:03,716
I can't see! I can't see!

1847
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:04,888
Sam!

1848
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:06,844
It's on my hand! Grab the knife! Knife!

1849
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,225
- I'm trying!
- Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!

1850
02:04:08,733 --> 02:04:12,442
The bomb's gonna blow!
The bomb's gonna...

1851
02:04:12,528 --> 02:04:14,484
You human scum!

1852
02:04:14,572 --> 02:04:16,483
- We got 20 seconds on that bomb!
- What bomb?

1853
02:04:16,574 --> 02:04:17,609
You see that bomb?

1854
02:04:17,951 --> 02:04:20,112
- Cut it, cut it, cut it!
- I got it!

1855
02:04:20,244 --> 02:04:22,075
How long do we have?

1856
02:04:22,872 --> 02:04:25,659
I'm gonna kick you!

1857
02:04:34,217 --> 02:04:35,627
Cut, cut, cut!

1858
02:04:37,095 --> 02:04:39,211
I'm gonna kill...

1859
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:58,028
Well, he's dead.

1860
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:02,575
Hey, Bee's going to run with
the rest of the Autobots

1861
02:05:02,662 --> 02:05:03,947
- and meet us at the edge of the river.
- All right.

1862
02:05:32,567 --> 02:05:35,604
It sucked me in!
There was nothing I could do!

1863
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:38,936
This is a total cluster...

1864
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:42,106
We got to get across the river.

1865
02:05:42,201 --> 02:05:43,862
You see that? She said the control pillar

1866
02:05:43,953 --> 02:05:45,193
- was in that first cupola.
- All right.

1867
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:48,287
Let's go! Move! Let's move!

1868
02:05:48,833 --> 02:05:50,869
<i>Tomahawks are inbound.</i>

1869
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:55,290
I'm in the traffic cameras.

1870
02:05:56,132 --> 02:05:58,168
<i>Four Autobots are captured.</i>

1871
02:05:58,384 --> 02:06:00,295
Oh, my God. We're helpless.

1872
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:03,177
Whatever's set to happen,
with those pulses getting faster,

1873
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:04,470
it's gonna happen soon.

1874
02:06:05,141 --> 02:06:06,756
<i>No sign of Optimus.</i>

1875
02:06:07,643 --> 02:06:10,055
How do we get these bridges down?

1876
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:13,096
Spread out. Check in there.

1877
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:15,936
Epps!

1878
02:06:16,027 --> 02:06:18,063
Epps, I've been looking for your ass.
How you doing?

1879
02:06:18,154 --> 02:06:20,736
Retirement is wack. Even worse,

1880
02:06:20,823 --> 02:06:22,563
we can't get across the river
to that building,

1881
02:06:22,658 --> 02:06:24,569
and the Autobots
are upstairs, surrounded.

1882
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,240
Just pan the camera around, all right?

1883
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:34,246
All right. Pan... Pan right. That's you.

1884
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:37,454
Try getting into the bridge control room.

1885
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:41,670
What are they doing?
They're just standing there.

1886
02:06:41,761 --> 02:06:45,674
Hang on. Dutch, see if you can
hack into the bridge.

1887
02:06:46,557 --> 02:06:48,639
Sir, SEALs are here.

1888
02:06:48,726 --> 02:06:50,557
It's a good day, boys! What do you got?

1889
02:06:50,645 --> 02:06:52,761
Got a 10-man SEAL unit, sir,
tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.

1890
02:06:52,855 --> 02:06:53,844
- How long?
- Fifteen.

1891
02:06:54,065 --> 02:06:57,728
- You're my prisoners!
- Take it easy. We surrender.

1892
02:06:58,528 --> 02:06:59,859
Get off me.

1893
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:02,191
Get off me!

1894
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:05,485
All right, you're gonna need your
40 Mike-Mikes and frags. Go full auto.

1895
02:07:05,576 --> 02:07:09,444
The vibrations jack up their circuits.
Snipers, shoot for the eyes.

1896
02:07:09,539 --> 02:07:12,201
All right, your target is up
on top of that building, that cupola.

1897
02:07:12,542 --> 02:07:15,284
How doomed you are, Autobots.

1898
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:17,790
You simply fail to understand

1899
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:22,214
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

1900
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:25,047
Activating the bridge.

1901
02:07:36,566 --> 02:07:38,397
They happy about something.

1902
02:07:38,776 --> 02:07:40,641
We're in the heart of their ship.

1903
02:07:40,736 --> 02:07:42,692
Let's give 'em a little ride.

1904
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:45,112
We gonna screw this ship up.

1905
02:07:45,491 --> 02:07:47,903
It's a 128K binary encryption code.

1906
02:07:49,245 --> 02:07:50,906
It's difficult.

1907
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:54,489
But not for me. I'm in. Bridge down.

1908
02:07:56,002 --> 02:07:58,414
The bridge is coming down!
Someone's watching over us!

1909
02:07:59,046 --> 02:08:00,582
Come on! Let's go!

1910
02:08:00,798 --> 02:08:03,289
"Pleasure working with you, Seymour."

1911
02:08:03,384 --> 02:08:05,090
I believe you're supposed to say.

1912
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:07,418
Good job, Dutch.

1913
02:08:14,270 --> 02:08:15,851
Get off me!

1914
02:08:40,671 --> 02:08:43,253
Hurry! They're triggering the pillars!

1915
02:08:44,508 --> 02:08:46,669
Prisoners? You're keeping prisoners?

1916
02:08:47,011 --> 02:08:48,967
Yes.

1917
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,795
You need to teach them about respect.

1918
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:53,381
This was all business, but now
it's personal, do you understand me?

1919
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:59,971
I understand.
No prisoners, only trophies.

1920
02:09:00,816 --> 02:09:04,434
Bee, I think they're going to kill us.

1921
02:09:05,488 --> 02:09:08,730
- You, your time is up.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1922
02:09:08,824 --> 02:09:11,110
We surrendered! We're your prisoners.

1923
02:09:11,202 --> 02:09:13,409
- Move it!
- Can't we talk this out?

1924
02:09:13,496 --> 02:09:17,114
We're all a bunch of good chaps!
I mean you no...

1925
02:09:19,835 --> 02:09:21,871
Why did you...

1926
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:30,961
Good-bye, my old friend.

1927
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:34,012
You're mine now.

1928
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:48,861
Get off me!

1929
02:09:49,532 --> 02:09:50,988
- I got to help him.
- What?

1930
02:09:51,826 --> 02:09:53,282
What are you doing?

1931
02:09:53,369 --> 02:09:55,860
- I got to help him.
- Sam, you can't help him.

1932
02:10:03,879 --> 02:10:06,120
Turn around.

1933
02:10:15,057 --> 02:10:17,639
We... We gave 'em a hell of a run.

1934
02:10:33,576 --> 02:10:35,191
We did it, Brains! We did it!

1935
02:10:35,286 --> 02:10:36,822
Rip this ship apart!

1936
02:11:15,451 --> 02:11:18,067
- We had a nice run, Brains, you and me.
- Yeah, we gonna die.

1937
02:11:34,762 --> 02:11:37,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, baby!
You all come with us!

1938
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:40,847
Go! You guys,
follow that ground team! Go!

1939
02:11:40,935 --> 02:11:44,177
- Move, move, move!
- Epps, third floor! We're going to 45!

1940
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:51,434
All right. Two snipers, right here!

1941
02:11:53,489 --> 02:11:54,478
All right, dock up!

1942
02:11:56,117 --> 02:11:57,982
We jump in three minutes!

1943
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:02,991
Set up shop right here.

1944
02:12:07,586 --> 02:12:08,701
Set up.

1945
02:12:10,631 --> 02:12:11,996
I'm downstairs.

1946
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:14,673
We got five targets
and Shockwave right below us.

1947
02:12:14,927 --> 02:12:16,667
<i>Stand by to jump!</i>

1948
02:12:16,762 --> 02:12:19,094
All right, let's go! Get ready, get ready.

1949
02:12:32,403 --> 02:12:34,018
Go!

1950
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:45,613
Snipers, take out their eyes.

1951
02:12:49,378 --> 02:12:50,868
All right, demo team, let's crank steel.

1952
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:01,132
Turning steel!

1953
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:38,669
Don't fire till I tell you!

1954
02:13:49,522 --> 02:13:50,932
Go!

1955
02:13:52,816 --> 02:13:54,352
Good job, kid!

1956
02:13:54,443 --> 02:13:55,478
Fire!

1957
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:09,284
- We got him!
- Yeah!

1958
02:14:10,459 --> 02:14:12,074
He's on the run!

1959
02:14:14,421 --> 02:14:16,503
Autobots, attack!

1960
02:14:21,804 --> 02:14:23,760
Mortar that bridge!

1961
02:14:27,434 --> 02:14:29,766
It's our world now!

1962
02:14:30,646 --> 02:14:32,637
Commence transport!

1963
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:47,276
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1964
02:15:01,927 --> 02:15:03,258
Optimus!

1965
02:15:38,213 --> 02:15:40,204
You die!

1966
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:49,508
No!

1967
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:02,396
Get down here, Sentinel!

1968
02:16:02,488 --> 02:16:04,570
Optimus,

1969
02:16:04,657 --> 02:16:06,568
you forget your place!

1970
02:16:13,415 --> 02:16:17,078
I bring you Cybertron, your home,

1971
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:21,083
and still you choose humanity.

1972
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:25,086
You were the one who taught me
freedom is everyone's right.

1973
02:16:28,597 --> 02:16:30,838
I will retrigger that pillar!

1974
02:16:30,933 --> 02:16:34,016
Then you'll have to go through me!

1975
02:16:38,023 --> 02:16:39,513
Okay, I've got to try and help.

1976
02:16:39,608 --> 02:16:41,519
- I have to. You stay here.
- Don't you go. Don't go.

1977
02:16:41,610 --> 02:16:44,977
You'll be fine, okay? I promise.
I got to get to that pillar.

1978
02:16:47,241 --> 02:16:49,072
Charge the pillar!

1979
02:16:49,159 --> 02:16:50,490
We got Autobots!

1980
02:17:07,803 --> 02:17:09,759
Reinforcements!

1981
02:17:09,847 --> 02:17:12,680
Decepticon ships, fire at Optimus!

1982
02:17:17,229 --> 02:17:19,891
We're taking fire!
I need those Tomahawks now!

1983
02:17:20,149 --> 02:17:21,764
<i>First wave inbound.</i>

1984
02:17:27,906 --> 02:17:30,522
We've got to cover for Optimus!

1985
02:17:44,673 --> 02:17:47,836
Decepticons, trigger the pillar!

1986
02:17:48,552 --> 02:17:50,543
Restart that pillar!

1987
02:17:51,013 --> 02:17:52,423
Trigger the pillars.

1988
02:17:53,307 --> 02:17:57,550
I can't hold them!
The ships have us pinned!

1989
02:17:58,270 --> 02:17:59,680
No!

1990
02:18:00,022 --> 02:18:02,559
Inbound, 10 seconds! Danger close!

1991
02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:04,935
Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, 14250!

1992
02:18:05,027 --> 02:18:06,267
Positive surface contact.

1993
02:18:06,361 --> 02:18:07,851
<i>- Target I. D</i>.
- Target acquired.

1994
02:18:36,433 --> 02:18:39,015
- Dylan! Wait!
- No!

1995
02:18:42,022 --> 02:18:43,057
Dylan!

1996
02:18:44,149 --> 02:18:45,559
Stop! Stop!

1997
02:18:45,901 --> 02:18:47,141
No!

1998
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:49,647
You can't do this, okay?

1999
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,236
There's only one future for me.

2000
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:22,518
Cybertron, you are saved, at last.

2001
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:34,647
Have you come to surrender?

2002
02:19:35,075 --> 02:19:37,487
- Was it all worth it?
- Obviously.

2003
02:19:37,578 --> 02:19:41,617
All your work to bring Sentinel back
and now clearly he has all the power.

2004
02:19:41,999 --> 02:19:43,785
It's actually almost tragic.

2005
02:19:43,876 --> 02:19:46,993
You dare lecture me, slave?

2006
02:19:47,087 --> 02:19:49,669
Your Decepticons
finally conquering this planet,

2007
02:19:49,756 --> 02:19:51,087
and yet, their leader won't be you!

2008
02:19:51,174 --> 02:19:55,508
It will be me! It will always be me.

2009
02:19:56,597 --> 02:19:58,679
In any minute now,

2010
02:19:58,765 --> 02:20:02,599
you'll be nothing but Sentinel's bitch.

2011
02:20:09,776 --> 02:20:11,437
Rock et!

2012
02:20:12,905 --> 02:20:14,111
Die!

2013
02:20:26,668 --> 02:20:27,999
You chose sides?

2014
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:30,164
You chose wrong.

2015
02:20:36,345 --> 02:20:39,178
Always the bravest of us!

2016
02:20:42,184 --> 02:20:44,721
But you could never make
the hard decisions!

2017
02:20:47,773 --> 02:20:50,810
Our planet will survive!

2018
02:20:51,777 --> 02:20:52,983
No!

2019
02:21:02,871 --> 02:21:05,908
We were gods once. All of us.

2020
02:21:06,041 --> 02:21:08,373
- But here...
- Please!

2021
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,872
...there will only be one!

2022
02:21:21,807 --> 02:21:25,516
This is my planet!

2023
02:21:36,238 --> 02:21:38,194
I just saved a whole other world.

2024
02:21:38,407 --> 02:21:41,240
You think you're a hero, huh?
You think you're a hero?

2025
02:21:41,576 --> 02:21:44,033
No. I'm just a messenger.

2026
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:53,126
The pillar's still connected!

2027
02:21:55,048 --> 02:21:56,458
Bring it up!

2028
02:21:56,758 --> 02:21:58,965
- Bee! Let's do this!
- Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

2029
02:21:59,052 --> 02:22:00,667
Pillar's still connected!

2030
02:22:00,762 --> 02:22:03,003
Rip that pillar down!

2031
02:22:26,288 --> 02:22:30,031
Now, we need a truce.

2032
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:33,538
All I want is to be back in charge.

2033
02:22:33,628 --> 02:22:35,710
Besides,

2034
02:22:35,797 --> 02:22:39,585
who would you be without me, Prime?

2035
02:22:39,676 --> 02:22:42,088
Time to find out.

2036
02:23:04,618 --> 02:23:07,735
Optimus, all I ever wanted

2037
02:23:07,829 --> 02:23:10,320
was the survival of our race.

2038
02:23:10,749 --> 02:23:15,083
You must see why I had to betray you.

2039
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:17,502
You didn't betray me.

2040
02:23:18,006 --> 02:23:20,338
You betrayed yourself.

2041
02:23:20,675 --> 02:23:22,211
No, Optimus!

2042
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:19,981
Sam.

2043
02:24:59,274 --> 02:25:02,107
I love you.

2044
02:25:03,486 --> 02:25:04,726
You're the only thing
I need in this world,

2045
02:25:04,821 --> 02:25:07,437
and I'll do anything to make it up to you,
I promise.

2046
02:25:08,074 --> 02:25:10,690
I'm going to hold you to that.

2047
02:25:10,785 --> 02:25:12,275
Just never let me go.

2048
02:25:13,205 --> 02:25:14,820
I promise.

2049
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:21,584
Rings.

2050
02:25:29,387 --> 02:25:30,968
I love this car.

2051
02:25:31,264 --> 02:25:35,052
Bee, you've got to slow it down.
You got to slow way down, okay?

2052
02:25:35,936 --> 02:25:37,176
I'm just trying to help out.

2053
02:25:39,314 --> 02:25:40,975
<i>In any war</i>

2054
02:25:41,107 --> 02:25:44,099
<i>there are calms between storms.</i>

2055
02:25:44,819 --> 02:25:46,025
You fought bravely.

2056
02:25:46,112 --> 02:25:48,728
<i>There will be days when we lose faith.</i>

2057
02:25:48,823 --> 02:25:51,656
<i>Days when our allies turn against us.</i>

2058
02:25:52,327 --> 02:25:56,741
<i>But the day will never come</i>
<i>that we forsake this planet</i>

2059
02:25:56,998 --> 02:25:59,489
<i>and its people.</i>

2060
02:26:20,814 --> 02:26:25,023
That's what I call
the start of a beautiful future.

2061
02:26:26,194 --> 02:26:28,150
Arrest him.

2062
02:26:28,321 --> 02:26:29,356
It was worth it!

2063
02:26:29,447 --> 02:26:31,529
- Get him out of here!
- I'd go to jail for love! I don't care!

2064
02:26:31,741 --> 02:26:34,608
Go ahead, take me in! I want to go in!
Let's go in.

2065
02:26:34,703 --> 02:26:36,534
Come on, Charlotte,
take me in right now!
