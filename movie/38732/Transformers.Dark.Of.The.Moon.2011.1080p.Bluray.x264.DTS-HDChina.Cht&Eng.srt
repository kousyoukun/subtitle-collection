You know how demoralizing it is to save the world twice,

134
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,970
還要卑躬屈膝去找個工作
to be groveling for a job.

135
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,190
別人又不知道你拯救過世界  山姆
They don't know you saved the world, Sam.

136
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,320
我知道  我信你

137
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,060
政府知道  但也沒給我在華盛頓安排個工作
Government knows, but he doesn't give me a job right here in D.C.

138
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,650
我應該和汽車人一起工作
I mean I should be working with the autobots.

139
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,910
不然太不公平了
Otherwise, it's not fair.

140
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,220
好啦  他們供你念完了大學
Come on, they paid for your college.

141
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,250
總統頒給你一塊英雄獎章

142
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,680
謝謝  小伙子  幹得不錯
Thank you, man. Great job.

143
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,480
而且我記得
And as I recall

144
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,460
這還不是那天的高潮
that wasn't even the highlight of your day.

145
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,170
大使先生  給

放在盒子
Leave it in the box, right.

150
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,340
收在盒子  這盒子真漂亮
You keep it in there, what a gorgeous box.

151
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,100
對  我的獎章
Oh yeah, my medal.

152
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,990
你知道誰給我的嗎
You know who gave that to me?

153
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,140
誰
Who?

154
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,050
白宮內部對美國總統的稱謂縮略語

155
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,050
-博圖士  -噢

156
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,730
美國總統
The President of the United States.

157
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,330
所有人都很難找工作
Hey, it's hard for everybody to get a job.

158
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,970
我沒時間了
I don't have time.

159
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,600
我爸媽自駕游把世界玩了個遍
You see, my parents are going to be here in a week.

160
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,570
一周後就會到這兒
From their road-trip party world tour.

161
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,080
我爸就要來了  我卻沒個工作
My dad gets here, and I don't have a job.

162
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,520
他絕對會抽我  我時間不多了 
He's gonna spank me you know. It's go time for me.

163
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,890
好吧  今晚我給你個工作
All right, tonight I'll give you a job.

164
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,430
為我準備一頓浪漫的晚餐
Romance me with a nice dinner and, uh...

165
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,330
也許我會給你獎勵

166
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,870
-真養眼  -快滾開
- Good looking. - Get out of here.

167
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,440
等等  別  別
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

168
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,090
他太噁心了
Oh, he's gross.

169
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,000
她很火辣哦
She's good.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,100
他們被困在這
They've been stranded here,

171
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,060
得有人看著他們
somebody's got to watch out for them, you know.

172
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,400
昨天他還藏在我內衣櫥
Yesterday that one was in my underwear drawer.

173
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,240
不錯的選擇  也很養眼
Good reason, it looked real good too.

174
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,280
-幹嘛打我  -我想要個正常的男朋友
- What are you hitting, huh? - I want a normal boyfriend.

175
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,880
可你就愛我這點  不是嗎
That's what you love about me, isn't it?

176
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,070
真是個愛哭鬼
Heh, what a cry baby.

177
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,500
我還沒說過那個字呢
You know I don't have the word yet.

178
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,720
要是你能分攤房租  我可能就說了
Maybe a little bit closer when you can pay your half of the rent.

179
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,350
拜
Bye.

180
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,520
在外面都特麼讓我短路了
Frinking shorting my circuits out here.

181
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,530
你這樣做真不人道
It's inhumane, what it is.

182
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,650
讓我們住在陽台的盒子
Make us live in a box on a balcony.

183
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,230
旁邊還是頭畜生
Right next to a beast.

184
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,280
-把我當動物養嗎  -行了  住嘴
- Like a common animal. - Stop, okay.

185
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,340
你和你那神經的巫師朋友
You and your creepy psychic,

186
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,670
沒有允許不能進來
you can't be in here without permission.

187
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,900
誰說的  那個金髮小妞嗎
According to who, Miss blondy-blonde?

188
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,410
小狗狗  進去

191
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,810
真煩  我應該看這段
Ah shoot, I'd seen this one.

192
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,630
史波克發瘋那段
It's the one where Spock goes nuts.

193
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,700
山姆  我不知道搬來和這小妞同住會怎樣
You know Sam, I don't know about moving in with this chick.

194
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,130
要是她像上個姑娘一樣把我們甩了呢
Uh, what if she dumps us like the last girl?

195
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,960
我不喜歡她  太兇了
What she was mean, didn't like her.

196
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,950
我們得團結起來
Us guys got to stick together.

197
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,210
不  我們不是一家人  你們是政治難民
No, we're not family. You're a political refugee.

198
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,770
而我終於找到真正喜歡我的人
And I have finally found someone who appreciates me for me.

199
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,720
那你告訴她  我們不是寵物
Well you tell her that we're not your pets.

200
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,870
也不是玩具
And we're not your toys.

201
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,300
我們是高等智能外星種族
All right, we're an advanced genius alien race,

202
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
只想找個安身之處
just looking for a home.

203
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,320
-就停在這  -能在這停嗎
- We could leave it right here. - Didn't think we should stop.

204
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,020
得了吧  他們能拿我們怎麼辦  拖走嗎
Come on, what are they going to do, tow it?

205
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,130
他在哪
Where is he?

206
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,320

我想死你們了
I miss you guys so much.

209
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,310
當然  怎麼樣
Sure you did, what do you think?

210

-真不錯  -可愛吧

211
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,540
-經典裝扮  -少來
-Gold. - Stop it.

212
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,460
過段時間就知道是不是了
Wait until you see the end.

213
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,980
領帶很漂亮
Oh I love your little tie.

214
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,600
我媳婦呢
Hey, where's my girl?

- She's got a new job. - Right.

217
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,800
我以為你們一周以後才到
I thought you were going to be here in a week.

218
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,190
11月21號  老爸你告訴我的
The 21st of the 11th, Dad remember?

219
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,820
-這完全是興致所至  -這傢伙可快了
- It's all the enthusiastic thing... - ... A love job with flies.

220
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,660
我們耽誤你什麼事了嗎
Oh, are we keeping you from something?

221
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,900
比如  工作
Like say, your job.

222
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,240

223
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,320
我們很擔心
You had us worried.

224
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,080
我  我有面試

225
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,280
那挺好啊

226
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,220
-糟透了  -別說這話

227
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,420
你不用這麼悲觀  爸爸
You don't have to be so negative dad, you know.

228
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,280
你到了華盛頓  和你兒子  家人在一起
You're in DC, you're here with your son, your family.

山姆  我認為你去面試得穿條正式的褲子
Sam, I think for an interview you should wear real pants.

235
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,460
我認為一輩子都應該穿正式的褲子
I think for life you should wear real pants.

236
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,470
大黃蜂怎麼了
Oh, wha...what happened to Bumble Bee?

237
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,670
他出去執行任務了  我得拿這輛備用
He's off on his missions, I had to get this as a back-up.

這車會變成什麼
What does it change into?

240
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,480
什麼都不會變
It doesn't change into anything.

241
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,250
是個收藏家的藏品  便宜得很
It's a collectors' item, I got it for a steal.

242
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,510
只是需要修整一下  真的
It just needs some work, trust me.

243
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,560
挺不錯的  挺像大黃蜂
Oh, I think it's darling. It reminds me a lot of Bumble Bee.

244
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,310
如果大黃蜂也是堆廢鐵的話
If Bumble Bee were a sad piece of shit.

245
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,780
來  我們送你去

我們的新家地球  變化巨大

是國防部長的車

255
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,960
趴下  最好呆在原地別動 
On the ground. Better not move, and stay there.

256
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,900
我們組成秘密部隊在全球執行各種任務

回歸的跡象

259
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,620
我是瓦斯科特

260
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,470
隸屬烏克蘭能源部總理事會

我方政府會正式否認

我們有過本次談話

在一棟淨化設施埵釧珛o現 
At one of our decontamination facilities a discovery was made,

264
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,200

這棟設施的名字是切爾諾貝利

我聽說接下來兩萬年也不適合居住
I hear it won't be livable again for another 20,000 years.

269

Okay, I can't tell you how or when.

407
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,340
或為何  但我的確做了
Or why, but I have done shit that matters.

408
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,410
我只想再找個需要我的工作
And I'd just kinda like a job where I matter again.

409
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,640
所以謝了  不必回謝
So thank you, but no thank you.

410
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,200
-好嗎  -知道我怎麼想嗎
- Okay. -You know what I think?

411
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,410
你想要的工作將在這個工作以後出現
You want the job after this job.

412
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,550
可是孩子  這份工作是你必經的一站
But son, this is the job that's standing in your way.

413
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,820
這就是為何你能非常勝任這個工作
And that's why you're going to be so very, very good at it.

414
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,230
因為當我看著你
'Cause when I look at you.

415
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,730
彷彿看見年輕的自己
I see a younger me.

416
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,900
機密鳥巢總部  華盛頓特區

417
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,820
全體運行中的汽車人變形汽車
All running Autobots in car,

418
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,320
十五分鐘後開始訓練
training in 15 minutes.

419
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,050
意大利人在二十三號車位報告

420
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,550
橫炮在三十七號隔間進行武器測試
Sideswipe bay 37 for weapons assessment.

421
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,630
參議員  希望你記住  每當航天航空局
Senator, I suggest you remember that when the NASA

422
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,180
...需要資金  他們就給我打電話
...wants funding they call me.

423
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,630
中央情報局執行任務之前
When the CIA is going to take out a target.

424
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,690
也要得到我的許可
They ask first for my permission.

425
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,900
總統想知道哪位國會議員
When the President wants to know

426
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,200
在政治上不堅定
which members of Congress are politically vulnerable.

427
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,890
比如說未經發現的犯罪行為
In terms of oh, let's say undiscovered criminal conduct.

428
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,480
也會問過我
I'm on their memory dials.

429
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,000
美政府表示他們正對爆炸進行監視
USA agency say they have been monitoring the blast.

430
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,520
美國有線新聞網  伊朗發生工業事故

431
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,080
可事實上這是一起秘密軍事襲擊
But in fact this was a covert military strike.

432
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,330
目前沒有任何國家表示為這起爆炸負責
No nation has yet claimed ownership.

433
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,930
中央情報局為中東發生的這起
The CIA is up my ass about this mystery...

434
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,810
神秘爆炸事件對我糾纏不休
..raid in the middle east.

435
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,050
是時候坦白了  部隊是否參與此事
So it's time to come clean, was the unit involved?

436
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,450
不太清楚  女士
Uh, I'm not sure, Ma'am.

437
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,540
大家看好  就是這樣對霸天虎
All right guys, this is how you do a Decepticon...

438
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,800
的頭部進行致命攻擊
...head kill shot.

439
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,500
作為國家情報局的指揮官
As director of National Intelligence,

440
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,470
我喜歡有點腦子的答案
I'm a really big fan of intelligent answers.

441
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,260
我  我實在不能明確回答您
I...I can't really tell you definitively.

442
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,110
這些汽車人就像十幾歲的孩子
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

443
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,560
喜歡時不時地溜出去
They like to sneak out of the house once in a while.

444
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,180
蘭諾克斯上校  你究竟是不是指揮官 
Colonel Lennox, are you in command or are you not?

445
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,500
是的  女士  我是
Yes, Ma'am. I am....

446
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,520
別叫我女士  受夠了
Stop with the Ma'am, enough with the Ma'am.

447
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,790
我看起來有那麼老嗎
Do I look like a Ma'am?

448
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,760
沒有  女士  
No, ma'am.

449
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,470
是  女士  是
Yes, ma'am, yes.

450
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,960
-這是我最好的一件發明  -不錯
- This one is a perfect invention I have made. - Right.

451
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,110
太好了  他們來了
Oh, good they're here.

452
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,560
我叫齊  希望你們能解答他的疑問
My name's Que. I do hope you have answers for him.

453
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,990
我從沒見過他這麼心煩
I've never seen him so upset.

454
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,010
擎天柱  記得夏洛特·米櫻吧
Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing?

455
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,480
國家情報局的主管
Our director of National Intelligence.

456
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,400
他心情不好
He's in a bad mood.

457
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,750
他今天誰都不想理
He's a not want to talk-a to anybody today.

458
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,350
這算什麼
What is this?

459
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,030
安靜療法嗎
The silent treatment?

460
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,920
我們見過那種  這次不是
We've seen that, and this is not that.

461
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,510
-絕對不是  -這次更糟
- Definitely not. - This is worse.

462
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,040
擎天柱  你自己說
Prime, make something of yourself.

463
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,400
他很生氣
He's pissed.

464
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,020
你們騙了我們
You lied to us.

465
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,960
你們告訴我們
Everything humans' know of our planet

466
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,140
說已經共享了所有對我們星球已知的情況
we were told had all been shared.

467
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,320
那為什麼人類的土地上會發現這玩意
So why was this found in human possession?

468
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,270
這事兒我們也不知道
We were in the dark on this also.

469
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,370
今天以前只有主管能進入第7區
It was director only clearance at Sector 7, until now.

470
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,830
-把包拿來  -哪個包
- The bag. - Which bag?

471
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,910
鉑金女士包  綠色鴕鳥皮的
Hermes Birkin, green ostrich.

472
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,460
真受不了
Oh my god.

473
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,860
這是個鮮為人知的秘密
This is a secret few men knew.

474
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,770
知情人也死得差不多了
And fewer still remain alive.

475
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,170
請允許我向你介紹
Allow me to please introduce to you,

476
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,680
建立航空航天局的兩位主管
two of NASA's founding mission directors.

477
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,030
以及宇航員  波茲·阿爾德林博士
and astronaut, Dr. Buzz Aldrin.

478
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,180
最先登陸月球的兩人之一  長官
One of the first two men to step foot on the moon. Sir.

479
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,490
擎天柱
Optimus Prime.

480
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,060
作為後進的宇宙旅行者
From a fellow space traveler.

481
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,870
見到你很榮幸
It's a true honor.

482
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,710
我也很榮幸
The honor is mine.

483
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,110
我們整個六十年代的太空競賽
Our entire space race of the 1960's...

484
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,760
好像都是對某一事件的回應
...it appears was in response to an event.

485
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,370
我方宇航員對一架墜毀的外星飛船進行調查
Our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship.

486
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,990
艙內無人生還
No survivors on board.

487
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,480
在總指揮的命令下  我們發誓對一切保密
We were sworn to secrecy by our commander in chief.

488
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,090
這是一項永不能提及的任務
This was a mission you will never speak of.

489
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,010
明白  長官
I understand, sir.

490
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,530
航空航天局埵@有35人知道真正的計劃
A total of 35 people knew the real plan at NASA.

491
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,780
蘇聯人成功向月球發射了無人探測器
Soviets managed to land unmanned probes.

492
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,090
他們一定是以某種方式得到了燃料棒
Somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod.

493
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,930
我們認為俄國人的推斷出
We believe the Russians deduced

494
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,470
那只燃料棒是可裂變燃料裝置
that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly.

495
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,930
認為他們在切爾諾貝利對其監管及控制
Believed they had it mastered and harnessed it at Chernobyl.

496
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,930
切爾諾貝利  蘇聯歐洲部分中西部城市

497
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,090
我們接下來總共進行了六次任務
We went on six missions in all.

498
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,980
拍攝了大量照片和取樣
We took hundreds of photos and samples.

499
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,740
把它們永久性的封存起來
We locked them away forever.

500
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,670
而月球項目從此停止
And the moon program was shut down.

501
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,140
你們在哪兒找到墜毀殘骸的
Where did you search the crash hold?

502
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,070
飛船的名字叫做方舟
The ships name was the Ark.

503
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,490
我目睹它從賽博坦逃走
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

504
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,410
堶捧f載著一項汽車人技術
It was carrying an Autobot

505
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,040
能讓我們贏得戰爭
technology which would have won us the war.

506
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,590
堶掄晹鳥鱆
And its captain.

507
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,450
-機長是誰  -偉大的領袖  御天敵
- Who was this captain? - The Great Sentinel Prime.

508
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,300
發明這項技術的人
The technology's inventor.

509
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,740
他曾是汽車人的指揮官
He was commander of the Autobots.

510
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,950
是我的前任
Before me.

511
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,060
當務之急是
It's imperative that I find it

512
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,160
我必須在霸天虎知道具體位置之前找到它
before the Decepticons learn of its location.

513
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,010
我們汽車人的宇宙飛船可以到達那
Our Autobot space craft has the ability to get there.

514
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,690
而你們只能祈禱這還來得及
And, you must pray it's in time.

515
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,080
我想見卡莉·斯賓塞
Hi, I'm here to see Carly Spenser.

516
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,130
卡莉

517
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,990
你找到工作啦
You got the job?

我對這座太空山
I'm seriously curious about

523
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,730
真的很好奇

老闆也酷斃了
And he's the coolest guy, ever.

526
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,070

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,070
卡莉常跟我提起你

532
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,770
彼此彼此  你這棟房子真不錯 
Well, visa versa. It's a beautiful building you got.

533
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,900
簡直就是星際迷航堛漸禶~號
The Star Ship Enterprise here.

534
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,720
謝謝誇獎  這媞|雨
Thank you very much, it leaks.

535
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,650
在卡莉來幫忙整理藏品之前
Ah, before Carly came to help on the collection

536
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,680
這堣@團糟
it was just a complete mess.

537
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,510
不過現在修復重回正軌了
But now the restorations are back on track.

538
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,860
今年我要再戰圓石灘
I'm going to pebble beach this year,

539
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,930
再贏個獎盃放在那兒
going to need a trophy for that stand right there.

540
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,980
知道為什麼嗎
You know why?

541
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,940
因為你身邊這位大美人兒
Because this woman right here,

542
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,310
正是我的秘密武器 很好  
...is my secret weapon. Okay.

543
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,480
古爾德先生  拜託 你太誇張了
Mr. Gould please, you exaggerate.

544
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,070
我只負責安排事宜而已
All I've done is get you organized.

545
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,400
你可遠不止這樣  管家婆 
Oh you have done much more than that, my Dutchess.

546
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,100
昵稱啊  挺有趣的
Nicknames, that's fun.

547
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,970
沒錯  管家婆
Yeah, the Dutchess.

548
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,720
她真可愛
She's adorable.

549
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,630
我從英國大使館把她挖走的時候
You know when I stole her away from the British Embassy,

550
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,700
我說過  管理一個國家容易
I said, it's easy to manage a country.

551
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,860
管理物價的藝術藏品沒那麼簡單
Try managing a priceless collection of art.

552
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,760
看這款1939年的德拉哈耶165敞篷車
Take a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

553
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,160
法國人設計的
Designed by a French man.

554
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,930
看看這線條  真是精緻無比
Look at the curves, elegant isn't it?

555
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,350
美極了
Beautiful.

556
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,350
讓人充滿慾望
Sensual.

557
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,280
讓人想起女人的完美曲線
Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman.

558
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,290
快來
Come on.

559
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,730
我父親有一張十塊錢的桌子和一個夢想
My dad had a ten dollar desk and a dream.

560
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,580
由此他建立了一家大企業
And he built it into an empire.

561
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,550
我們是美國最大的會計師事務所
We're the largest accounting firm in the US.

562
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,040
我的商業投機是在他過世之後才開始的
I started off the adventure side after he passed.

563
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,390
未來就會如此
That's in the future.

564
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,940
在成功者身上下注
Try and bet on the winners.

565
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,960
收藏汽車讓我保持清醒
See collecting cars helps me keep my sanity.

566
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,020
拍得不錯
These look great.

567
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,770
那天真精彩  古爾德先生
Oh, that was a great day, Mr. Gould.

568
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,800
-我之前都沒看到那張  -我也沒見過
- I didn't see that one. - No, me either.

569
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,060
褲子夠緊的
Jeans are tight.

570
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,430
來吧  來吧
Oh, here we go, here we go.

571
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,510
看見了嗎
You see that?

572
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,620
以貌取人  看我開破車就看不起我 
Judgment, judge to my car.

573
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,140
你還等著他看不起我嗎
You going to wait on him while he's judging me?

574
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,800
你怎麼啦  他是我老闆
What's with you? He's my boss.

575
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,540
我們吃的住的花得都是他的錢
He still pays for our food, our rent.

576
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,530
不是  我完全理解
No, I totally understand.

577
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,190
我一點都不在乎  我明白  我被養活得不錯 
I'm totally fine, I get it. I'm well fed.

578
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,900
你猜怎麼著  我不再當你的小白臉了
Guess what, I'm not your boy toy anymore.

579
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,900
現在起我提上褲子掙錢養家了
I got my big boy pants on now.

580
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,730
看見沒
You see them?

581
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,080
麻煩上車  管家婆
In the car, thank you Duchess.

582
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,260
天哪  你吃他的醋嗎
Oh, my god, are you threatened by him?

583
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,700
吃醋  我為什麼吃醋
Threatened, what am I threatened by?

584
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,370
為他的錢  權  還是臉蛋兒吃醋
His money, his power, his good looks?

585
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,810
都不是  就選這個
None of the above, check!

586
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,870
你耍小孩子脾氣的樣子太性感了
Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

587
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,090
拜託上車吧
Get in the car, please.

588
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,330
山姆  向我諂媚的不是他一個 
Sam, he's hardly the first man to ever smile at me.

589
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,210
我覺得我能處理好
I think I can handle it.

590
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,820
等等  是你對他的回應讓我不爽 
Hold on, hold on. It's..It's the smiling back part that gets me.

591
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,970
-知道嗎  -不再對他笑了
- Okay. - No more smiles.

592
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,430
再也不笑了  我保證
Never again, I promise.

593
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,680
你看  我就吃這套 
You see, that works for me.

594
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,350
別急  別急
Easy, easy.

595
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,740
這麼弄可發動不起來
You're not going to get it started that way.

596
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,490
什麼  我就是讓它預熱一下
What, I was just getting it ready.

597
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,890
我差不多做完了32%的修復工作
I'm about 32% done with my restoration.

598
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,350
鍍上鉻  在後面加個擾流板  搞定
Chrome work, put a spoiler on the back, done deal.

599
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,690
卡莉一直跟我說你為找不到工作煩心
You know Carly's been telling me you've been struggling job loss.

600
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,970
然後你都知道了
Just so you know.

601
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,950
我剛好是艾奇利塔系統董事會成員
I'm on the board for Accuretta systems.

602
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,820
我替你打了個電話
And I put in a call for you.

603
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,410
此事你知我知  好嗎
Just keep it between us, okay.

604
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,900
她對我很好
She's so kind to me.

605
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,890
你運氣真好
You're a lucky man.

606
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,280
蒼耳接近靜海基地

607

把自己封藏了起來

620
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,860
別那麼貪心

我的小寶貝們

622
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,790
您看起來不太好  主人

623

汽車人上鉤了
Autobots have taken the bait.

629

630
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,250
把堶悸漯F西帶回來了

643
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,630
穿這麼暴露算怎麼回事
What's this hoochee around here?

644
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,240
是因為...
Just because...

645
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,920
不行  我們公司做的是航空工業
No. This is the aerospace baby.

你被開除了
You are not allowed back here.

647

新人  看見沒
New guy, you see that?

648
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,080
那個拉丁人被炒了
That's a Latin melt down, okay.

649
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,200
要是你穿一身便裝出現在我的辦公室 你就被炒了
You ever show up in my office with a regional outfit you're fired.

I want you to live it, love it and made it.

653
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,620
我的地盤沒有靠關係升級這種事  這堿鰜葖傸Y明
There's no ladder climbing in my office. I run a tight ship.

654
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,310
-是的  先生  -很好  去幹活

657
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,450
閉嘴
Shut up!

658
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,200
你再這麼干我就揍死你
You do that to me again and I'll kick your ass.

659
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,780

你怎麼樣
You're good?

661
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,380
我要在市中心開個會  過來看你沒問題吧
I had a meeting downtown, is it okay for me to stop by?

662
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,700
不知道  500頁的員工守則 
I don't know my 500 page

663
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,710
一下可看不完

664
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,850

這可能是做夢吧  快來

違反訪客準則了

669
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,530

00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,390
好了吧
Okay.

815
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,790
威特維奇
Witwicky.

816
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,540
在見報之前
When this comes out in the press,

817
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,460
你去收拾乾淨  到處都是王的屍體
you clean up. Wang is everywhere.

818
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,400
鐵絲網上  柱子上
He is in the bristle. He's in the bamboo.

819
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,970
欄杆上
He's on the balustrade.

820
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,560
你看見那堛漱H行道了嗎
Did you see the sidewalk down there?

821
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,940
天吶
Oh, man.

822
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,090
你要忘了這個人  把他停車位上的名字撤下來
You forget his person, get his name off his parking space.

823
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,400
我們什麼時候買了個新的複印機
Hey, when did we get a new copier?

824
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,670
我看到的事情我絕不透露半個字
See, I'm not gonna say anything about what I saw?

825
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,550
你跟誰共用一個廁所完全是你的事
Who you share a toilet stall with is totally your business.

826
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,890
這絕對是日貨
This is exceedingly Japanese.

827
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,720
日貨總是這麼難搞
They never make it easy.

828
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,730
你怎麼了
What is with you?

829
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,940
這事很重要  卡莉
This is the really deal, Carly.

830
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,170
好吧  我要你保持鎮靜
Okay, I need you to stay composed.

831
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,220
是真的  我一會兒給你解釋
It's real life, I'll explain to you later.

832
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,450
這是緊急情況  幫我聯繫蘭諾克斯上校
We got an emergency, you gotta get Colonel Lennox in here.

833
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,020
跟霸天虎有關  霸天虎回來了
On point decepticons, the deceptions are back again.

834
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,500
-馬上給我把那門打開  -冷靜  先生
- You gotta open that gate up right now. - Easy, sir.

835
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,820
這堿O衛生和人類服務部
This is health and human services.

836
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,340
好吧  都裝備上M-4了
Right, packing M-4's?

837
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,360
M-4是卡賓槍的一種型號  用於部隊實戰

838
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,720
這麼大陣勢要保護什麼  結腸袋嗎
What are you protecting, colostomy bags?

839
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,270
-便盆還是止咳糖  -寶貝兒
- Bed pans, throat lozenges? - Babe.

840
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,810
你們的帽子哪堥茠  護士學校嗎
Where did you get that hat from? Nursing school?

841
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,520
所以你們是在保護護士跟足光粉嗎
So your are nurses and foot powder protector.

842
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,870
-很好  不錯  -寶貝兒  我覺得我們
- Oh, fantastic, yes. - Baby, I don't think we're in....

843
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,150
-找錯地方了  -我們沒有找錯地方
- ... the right place. - We are in the right place.

844
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,120
我們沒有找錯地方
We are in the right place.

845
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,940
我們沒有找錯地方
We are in the right place,

846
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,070
我馬上要跟擎天柱說話
and I want to talk to Optimus right now.

847
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,150
你現在去給我找擎天柱
You're going to get me Optimus right now.

848
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:51,990
我想你找錯地方了
I'm sure you got the wrong building.

849
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,860
我不知道你在說什麼
I don't know what you're talking about.

850
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,790
霸天虎回來了  你聽不懂嗎
What part of the Deceptions are back don't you understand?

851
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,600
你能放聰明點嗎
You're being a smart ass.

852
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,540
不要砸我的車  這可是收藏品
Do not hit my car, it's a collector's item.

853
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,150
要是我就不會這麼干
I wouldn't do that.

854
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,200
你真是瘋了
You're crazy.

855
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,100
檢測到有能量塊
We got an Energon reading.

856
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,590
車上那麼少可能會被忽略
We got Missed it by that much in the vehicle.

857
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,380
-不許動  -我們不動
- Freeze! -Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're freezing.

858
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,260
你是不是...
Are you...

859
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,540
請從車堨X來
Please get out of the car.

860
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,090
-我抓住他了  快走  -大黃蜂
- I got him, go. - Bee!

861
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,310
大黃蜂在嗎
Is Bee in there?

862
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,910
-好吧  你抓住我了  -趴下
- Okay, you got me. - Stay down.

863
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,470
你就是這麼對待汽車人的
This how you treat Autobots?

864
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,680
我們是一條戰線上的
We're on the same team.

865
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,410
好好享受你以後在7-11的工作吧  混球
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-11, dickhead.

866
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,270
-好吧  -混蛋
- That's right. - A-hole.

867
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,550
現在瞧瞧你的車吧
How's your car now?

868
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,420
那才是我的車
That's my car.

869
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,620
過來
Come here.

870
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:52,930
過來
Come here!

871
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,950
別這樣  山姆
Come on... Sam.

872
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,560
你怎麼回事
What is your deal, huh?

873
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,320
我知道你們的什麼秘密行動很重要
I know your black ops stuff is important.

874
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,310
要知道我不是想攔著你
You know I'm not trying to diminish it,

875
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,550
讓你內疚或者怎麼樣的
or guilt trip you, or anything.

876
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,740
但是我好久沒見到你了
But I just never see you anymore.

877
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,300
你就不能回來車庫呆一個晚上嗎
You can't come to the garage and stay on one night?

878
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,710
山姆  你這麼說我很難過
Sam, that makes me feel bad.

879
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,680
我真希望你難過  你就應該難過
Yeah, well, I hope you feel bad, you should feel bad.

880
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,740
看看我現在開的這個老破車
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.

881
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,980
我每天都覺得很難過
I feel bad every single day.

882
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,750
跟我來  你們倆
Yo, let's go, both of you.

883
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,740
蘭諾克斯要見你們
Lennox wants to see you.

884
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,210
怎麼了  現在我們就配不上你了嗎
What, we're not good enough for you anymore.

885
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,980
抱歉  寶貝兒  他們很粗魯  對嗎
Sorry, babe, they were very rude, right.

886
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,890
你給我把車修好
And you're fixing my car.

887
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,540
你反對嗎
You don't think so?

888
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,600
要是你今天遇到了一個會飛的變態
Raise your hand if you had a

889
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,050
複印機隱者殺手  請舉手 
flying psycho ninja copier try to kill you today.

890
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,330
那些是我的銅指節
Those are my brass knuckles.

891
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,280
那是我腳環  需要我把那個也脫下來嗎
That's my anklet, do I have to take that off too?

892
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,390
還有我腳趾環
And my toe rings?

893
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,310
全部無關人員撤離本
All the unofficials clear the floor.

894
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,370
距離接觸行動  還有十分鐘
We have ten minutes until attempted contact.

895
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,060
我們已經拿到
We've taken possession of

896
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,980
藏在御天敵飛船上的五個設備
the five devices that were hidden in the ship of Sentinel Prime.

897
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,220
某種程度上說他們是汽車人的原型科技
They're some kind of prototype Autobot technology.

898
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,960
他們說御天敵是他們文明堛熒R因斯坦
They say Sentinel was the Einstein of his civilization.

899
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,490
所以我們要把這些鎖起來
So we're going to keep these locked up,

900
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,020
直到我們弄清楚這些是什麼
... until we know what we're dealing with.

901
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,270
現在不許任何人接近
Right now no one gets access.

902
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,470
-任何人  -今早有個人認出我來了
- No one. - This morning a guy recognized me.

903
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:54,860
他讓我來提醒你
He told me to warn you,

904
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,080
他說到月之陰影
he's talking about the dark side of the moon.

905
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,090
-然後他們把他殺了  -等一下  你說月亮
- Then they killed him. - Wait a minute, you mentioned the moon?

906
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,290
是啊  月之陰影 
Yeah, dark side of the moon.

907
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,800
但是為什麼霸天虎想要殺害人類呢
But why would the decepticons want to kill humans?

908
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,090
我以為他們的敵人是汽車人
I thought their war was with the Autobots.

909
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,390
這是他第一次做定時報告的時間
And that is when he made his first quick list of time report.

910
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,470
這就是我想要的
That's what I want..

911
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,440
那個女的是誰  好的
Who's the chick, okay.

912
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,450
請問  蘭諾克斯上校
Excuse me, Colonel Lennox.

913
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,490
米櫻局長
Director Mearing.

914
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:13,790
這位是山姆·威特維奇
This is Sam Witwicky.

915
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,510
-一個平民  -我知道他是誰  上校
- A civilian c.. - I know his name, Colonel.

916
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,020
我想知道誰讓他進來的
I want to know who gave him clearance.

917
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,730
誰讓我進來的  不如說是擎天柱
Who gave me Clearance? How about Optimus Prime.

918
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,770
在他降落在郊區尋找我房子的時候
When he touched down in suburbia looking for my house.

919
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,900
這位是國家情報局主管
This is the national intelligence director.

920
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,190
要是你...
In case you...

921
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,260
-你好  -藐視國家官員
- Hi. - Disrespecting a federal officer.

922
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,050
你應該知道後果的  她是誰
That ought to get you somewhere, who's she?

923
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,110
她是我女朋友
She's my girlfriend.

924
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,140
這算怎麼回事  約會嗎
What is this like a date?

925
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,950
她知道所有汽車人的事情
She knows all about the Autobots, okay.

926
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,320
她知道大黃蜂  而且她來自軍人的家庭
She knows Bumblebee, and comes from a military family.

927
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,250
我可以替她擔保
I can vouch for her.

928
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,410
我有一個主意
Hey, I have an idea.

929
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,860
不如我們說回那個重要的話題
How bout we get back to the important topics?

930
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,370
比如說我的臉差點被霸天虎切下來
Like the fact I almost had my face cut off by a Decepticon.

931
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,800
事實上  作為一個納稅人  我可以投訴的
As a tax payer I can lodge a complaint as a matter of fact.

932
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,850
好了  聽著
Okay, listen.

933
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,440
山姆公司的一個軟體工程師今天被殺害了
One of the software engineers at Sam's office was murdered today.

934
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,500
他參與過太空總署的月球繪圖探測
He was involved in NASA's Lunar mapping probe.

935
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,280
事情是這樣的  蘭諾克斯上校
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

936
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,050
我們不能把國家安全托付給年輕人
We cannot entrust national security to teenagers.

937
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,000
除非說有什麼政策我不知道
Unless I missed the policy paper.

938
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,100
有嗎
Are we doing that now?

939
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,240
沒有  很好
No, good.

940
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,170
我不管你是誰
I don't care who you are.

941
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,010
要是你把在這堿搢鴘獄‘X去一個字
If you breathe a word of what you've seen here.

942
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,510
就以叛國罪把你扔進監獄
You will do time for treason.

943
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,030
明白了嗎
Do you understand me?

944
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,180
我只聽汽車人的命令
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.

945
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,630
我認識他們  我不認識你
I know them, I don't know you.

946
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,390
你會認識我的
You will.

947
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,960
御天敵
Sentinel Prime.

948
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,680
他是靠能量塊維持生存  他已經用完了
He seems to run on Energon, and he's out of it.

949
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,980
他現在是在睡眠模式
He's in a sort of a sleep mode.

950
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,470
開始吧
Let us begin.

951
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,380
這就是偉大的領袖矩陣
It's the great matrix of leadership.

952
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,030
他掌握著宇宙中僅有的一樣東西
He holds the only thing in the

953
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,520
能夠重新啟動變形金剛的火種
universe that can repower a Transformers spark.

954
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,020
太不可思議了
This is incredible.

955
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,800
御天敵
Sentinel Prime.

956
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,060
我們歡迎你回來
We bid you return.

957
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,470
復仇
Revenge.

958
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,280
-不  -不要開槍
- No. - Hold your fire.

959
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,640
-不要  御天敵  -不要開槍
- No, Sentinel. - Hold your fire.

960
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,240
是我  擎天柱
It is I, Optimus Prime.

961
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,820
沒事了
It is all right.

962
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,070
你安全了
You are safe.

963
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,700
沒什麼好怕的
There's nothing to fear.

964
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,640
我們來了
We are here.

965
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,180
你回家了  御天敵
You are home, Sentinel.

966
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,200
戰爭
The war?

967
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,510
戰爭
The war!

968
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,920
我們輸了
The war was lost.

969
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,560
賽博坦現在已經成了不毛之地
Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland.

970
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,420
我們在地球避難
We have taken refuge here on Planet Earth.

971
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,200
人類是我們的盟軍
Its human race is our allies.

972
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,460
我的飛船呢
My ship?

973
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,450
我們遭遇了襲擊
We came under fire.

974
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,670
傳送柱
The pillars.

975
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,220
傳送柱在哪
Where are the pillars?

976
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,250
你保住了五根
You saved five of them.

977
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,110
包括控制柱
Including the control pillar.

978
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,680
只有五根嗎
Only five?

979
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,070
我們以前有上百根的
We once had hundreds.

980
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,990
打擾一下  先生們  我能問問
Excuse me, gentlemen. May I ask,

981
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,080
你們要尋找的科技是什麼嗎
what is this technology you're looking for?

982
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,030
它具有重塑宇宙的能力
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

983
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,710
集結所有傳送柱就能形成空間橋
Together the pillars form a space bridge.

984
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,580
這是我設計的  只有我能控制
I designed and I alone can control it.

985
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,580
這打破了你們的物理學定理
It defied your laws of physics

986
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,470
物質一定要通過時間空間傳輸
to transport matter through time and space.

987
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:11,410
你們說的是瞬間傳輸  是嗎
You're talking about a teleportation device, aren't you?

988
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,370
是的  傳輸資源和難民
Yes, for resources, for refuges.

989
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,780
難民  或者軍隊
Refuges or troops of soldiers.

990
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,280
武器  或者炮彈
Weapons, maybe bombs.

991
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,740
一種瞬間襲擊的手段
A means of an instant strike,

992
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,140
這就是它的軍事功能  對嗎
that's its military function, isn't it?

993
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,200
這是我們的科技
It is our technology.

994
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,430
必須要歸還給我們
And it must be returned.

995
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,890
是的  如果人類同意的話
Yes, if humans say so.

996
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,840
你不能把大規模殺傷武器
You can't just bring weapons

997
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,980
運到我們的地盤
of mass destruction into our atmosphere.

998
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,670
首先要申報海關
Kind of have to declare customs first.

999
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,150
一種叫做文書工作的小手續
A little formality called paperwork.

1000
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,010
這是我們人類跟動物的區別
Kinda separates us from the animals.

1001
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,400
如果你能扛起我肩上的重擔
I will overlook your condescending tone

1002
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,050
我就忽略你這居高臨下的語氣
if you heave the gravity of mine.

1003
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,640
絕不能讓霸天虎知道空間橋在這
The decepticons must never know the space bridge is here.

1004
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,970
因為要是到了他們手上
For in their hands...

1005
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,310
你們的世界就完蛋了
... it would mean the end of your world.

1006
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,760
這文件做的太差
Totaly nightmare file.

1007
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,250
那就展開調查吧
So the investigation is open.

1008
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,670
我們會派特工去你辦公室
We sent agents to your office.

1009
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,830
現在
And for the time being,

1010
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,570
我們會讓汽車人護送你回家
we're going to send you home with Autobot protection.

1011
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,390
我需要跟誰說
Wh.. Who do I need to speak to,

1012
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,360
才能讓你們明白我可以幫忙
to get you guys to understand I can help.

1013
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,560
我可以幫忙
I can contribute.

1014
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,470
我們都可以幫上忙  告訴我你知道什麼
Hey, we can all help. You tell me what you know,

1015
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,740
我可以跟你說說我去過所有有趣的星球
I can tell you all the fun planets I've been.

1016
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,780
請從我桌子上下來
Get off my desk, please.

1017
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,440
你掏槍了  好吧  那我幫不了你
Aw, you pulling out guns. Okay, can't help you on that.

1018
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,700
天哪
Oh, my god.

1019
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,550
你想要我怎麼做  立刻回家
What do you envision for me? I go back home now?

1020
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,470
回去上班  繼續去複印嗎  我是說...
I go back to work? I make copies? I mean...

1021
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,260
這個部門堻ㄛO些有經驗的
This is a unit for veteran

1022
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,220
情報人員和特種部隊
intelligence officers and special forces.

1023
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,550
而不是開過特殊汽車的小男生
Not for boys who once owned special cars.

1024
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,670
這麼說有些刻薄吧  夫人
That's a bit harsh, isn't it ma'am?

1025
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,200
不要叫我夫人  我不是夫人
Don't call me ma'am, I'm not a ma'am.

1026
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,660
但你是女的  對吧
But you're a woman, aren't you?

1027
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,460
那麼...
Sooo.

1028
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,270
那些是你的嗎
Are those yours?

1029
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,740
是的  中情局發的
Yeah, CIA.

1030
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
我這麼問只是因為我也有一個
I only ask because I also have a medal.

1031
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,340
總統發的
From the President.

1032
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:40,340
是的
Yeah.

1033
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,680
不錯  所以其實沒那麼複雜對吧
Great, so it's not that complicated, right?

1034
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,280
沒有我的批准  誰也不許跟汽車人一起工作
No one gets to work with the Autobots unless I approve it.

1035
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,970
你是在破壞我的指揮系統
You're breaking my chain of command.

1036
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:49,940
來吧  走吧
Come on, let's go.

1037
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,950
你已經盡力了
You've done what you can for them.

1038
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,440
請恕我直言  年輕人
With all due respect, young man.

1039
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,750
我很欣賞你的所作所為
I appreciate what you did.

1040
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,890
但是你不是戰士
But you're not a soldier.

1041
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,080
你是個送信的  你一直就是個送信的
You're a messenger, you've always been a messenger.

1042
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,320
他是個英雄
He's a hero.

1043
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,810
大黃蜂  你坐貨物升降機  我們一會兒上面見
Bee, you take the freight elevator, I'll see you up there.

1044
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,900
要開戰了
Ah, this blows.

1045
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,240
-那個女士把我們踢出局了  -是啊
- That lady officially kicked us out. - Yeah.

1046
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,490
保護證人計劃遜斃了
Witness protection program sucks.

1047
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,640
是啊  但有大黃蜂和他的大炮
Yeah, but we're a whole

1048
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,720
我們安全多了
lot safer with big yellow and his cannons.

1049
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,510
那隻狗什麼都保護不了
That dog can't protect crap.

1050
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,060
大黃蜂
Bee.

1051
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,060
你睡不著
You couldn't sleep.

1052
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,380
是啊  我也是
Yeah, me too.

1053
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,770
我真不敢相信她管我叫送信的
I don't believe she called me a messenger.

1054
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,460
你能相信嗎  我做了這麼多  卻只是個送信的
Do you believe that? After everything I've done, I'm a messenger.

1055
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,220
我相信  跟你說  塞米  我們的感覺和你一樣
Oh, I believe it. I tell ya, Sammy, we feel the same way.

1056
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,360
地球上的人太無禮了
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

1057
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,640
我們得做點什麼
We should do something about it.

1058
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,100
大黃蜂
Bee.

1059
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,020
我想知道他們為什麼要殺害人類
I need to know why they're killing humans.

1060
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,880
不如我們給專家打個電話
What say we call in the expert?

1061
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:04,530
我下一位客人曾是美國情報人員
My next guest, is a former American intelligence operative

1062
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,220
他曾勇敢說出
who has dared to speak out

1063
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,420
我們的外星盟軍實情
regarding our alleged military alliance,

1064
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,980
而很多人稱
... with what many describe

1065
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:13,470
他們是外星球的僱傭兵
as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries.

1066
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,860
他是暢銷書《代號英雄》的作者
He is the author of the best selling book, "Code-Name Hero".

1067
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,160
有請我們的特工  西摩·西蒙斯 
For our special agent, Seymour Simmons.

1068
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,550
比爾  我是你的粉絲  我很高興來到這
Bill, big fan. Great to be here.

1069
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,780
西蒙斯特工
Now, agent Simmons.

1070
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,550
你希望我們相信這是我們
You would have us believe that it is in our best centuries

1071
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,240
在外星內戰中選擇陣營的最好時機
to formally take sides in this so called alien civil war?

1072
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,060
另一方想把我們砍了做早餐  所以
Well, the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast, so.

1073
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,250
我不認為我們還有別的選擇
I wouldn't exactly want to call it a toss up.

1074
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,170
那些霸天虎們是很危險的
These decepticons are lethal.

1075
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,800
但是民意調查顯示有一半的人類
But polls show half the world

1076
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,980
覺得所有的汽車人離開  地球才會安全
would feel safer with the Autobots completely gone.

1077
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,160
把他們弄走
Get them out of here.

1078
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,800
我們不需要他們
We don't need them here.

1079
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,900
那睡覺的時候要拿個手榴彈才安全了
I feel safer when I sleep with a hand grenade.

1080
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,280
我說的不一定對
It doesn't mean I'm always right.

1081
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,020
謝謝  事實上  我們手埵酗憟鬌膆雱A
Thank you. Here's a fact, we obtained documents that show you were

1082

-已經被情報委員會開除了  -查克  我在做採訪呢
- fired by the intelligence committee. - Chuck, I'm doing the interview.

1083

是為了縮小規模  比爾  預算削減
Down sized. Bill, budget cuts.

- Chuck, out. - ... report get severe delusional tendencies.

1085
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,840
這是新聞陷阱
This is ambush journalism.

1086
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,620
你想知道外星盟軍的真相嗎
You want the truth about the alien alliance?

1087
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,810
來買我的書吧

趁現在還來得及  各位 
Before it's to late, people.

1090
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,890
你想惹惱我嗎  比爾  脫光打一架
You want to piss me, Bill, you want get naked?

1091
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,510
我隨時奉陪  採訪結束
I'm ready, interview is over.

1092
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,110
-你像個發了瘋的間諜  -你給我滾出去
- You sound like a pin-head agent. - You get out of my house.

1093
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,550
我給你一個忠告吧
And I got a suggestion for you.

1094
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:16,450
採訪結束了  明白嗎
It is over, understand?

1095
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,230
損害防控
Damage control.

1096
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,560
-管家  -很明顯你弄得西蒙斯先生很心煩
- Dutch! - You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons.

1097
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,810
給你23秒離開這間屋子
You have 23 seconds to leave the property.

1098
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,320
我已經叫警察了
I have called the police.

1099
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,970
你們是群不自量力的農民
You are peasant people throwing rocks at a giant.

1100
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,300
接下來是什麼  還有什麼 
What's up next, what have we got?

1101
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,740
中午在市中心的新書籤售會
Book signing midtown at noon,

1102
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,990
然後是探索頻道的真人秀節目
then your pic reality show for discovery HM.

1103
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,610
對了  還有這個
Oh, and I had this, um... um.

1104
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,950
威特維奇  今天給我打了五個電話
The Witwicky who keeps calling me five times today.

1105
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,370
那個孩子  他想做什麼
The kid, what does he want?

1106
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,150
我打電話是因為霸天虎回來了
I called because the decepticons

1107
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,800
我想知道原因  我需要你的幫助
are back and I want to know why, and I need your help.

1108
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,930
他們回來了
They're back?

1109
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,390
那樣的話  又能賺錢了
Well, that's good for business.

1110
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,710
要是我告訴你我知道一個50年前
What if I told you I know a 50

1111
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,710
外星秘密而沒人告訴過你  怎麼樣
year old alien secret that nobody ever told you?

1112
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,000
別誘惑我
Do not tempt my addiction.

1113
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,280
我已經金盆洗手了  孩子
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

1114
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,540
管家  這條線路安全嗎
Dutch, is this line secure?

1115
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,380
不安全
No.

1116
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:56,970
加密

1117
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,570
別冒險
Don't take the risk.

1118
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,080
我很有錢  為什麼不冒險
I'm rich, why should I?

1119
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,140
別犯老毛病  我不會的
Do not relapse, I won't.

1120
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,890
別讓魔鬼們取得勝利
Do not let the demons win.

1121
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,160
線路安全

1122
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:06,890
好了
Got.

1123
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,860
什麼樣的秘密
What kind of.... secret?

1124
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,100
阿波羅號  月球  外星人  隱藏的
Apollo, moon, aliens, cover-up...

1125
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,630
未來科技  暗殺  一類的東西
... future tech, assassinations, that kind of stuff.

1126
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,460
阿波羅號
Oh, Apollo.

1127
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,790
管家
Dutch!

1128
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:31,160
告訴威震天  跟哥跳個舞吧
Tell Megatron, let's tango.

1129
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,950
這個星球如此宏偉  如此寧靜
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

1130
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,260
一點都不像賽博坦的末日歲月
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

1131
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,760
我很想知道它本來會是什麼樣子
I've wondered what might have been.

1132
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,660
如果是你指揮了最後的戰鬥
If you had fought the final battle.

1133
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:55,260
而不是我
Instead of me.

1134
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,090
永遠不要為過去悲傷  年輕的戰士
Never morn the past, young warrior.

1135
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,180
正是因為你  我們的種族才得以存續
Thanks to you, our race survives.

1136
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,540
你才是我們的首領  御天敵
You were our leader, Sentinel.

1137
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,920
再次領導我們是你的權利
It is your right to lead us again.

1138
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,680
在一個我不瞭解的世界
In a world I do not know.

1139
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,450
我不再是你的老師了  擎天柱
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.

1140
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,440
現在你是我的老師
You are mine.

1141
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,490
我們必須查清楚這件事
We've got to break this case down.

1142
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,810
這些宇航員的死亡迅速蔓延
What we have here is an astronaut epidemic.

1143
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,810
戰爭中失蹤的  去世了的  交通事故的
M.I.A., dead, died in a car accident,

1144
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,440
被謀殺的  送醫時死亡的  車禍死的
killed, D.O.A., car death.

1145
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,510
就像是這些傢伙不會開車
It's like these guys can't drive.

1146
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,640
他們可以飛去外太空
They can fly into outer space.

1147
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,000
但是他們卻不會開汽車
But they can't drive a car.

1148
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,620
你的資料拿到了  威特維奇
Procured your information, Witwicky.

1149
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,710
謝謝你  布魯斯
Thank you, Bruce.

1150
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,630
別關門
Noo.

1151
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,870
你得讓我見識一下  就一下
You let me see one of them, one time.

1152
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,480
-快點  -很快的
- Quick. - Very.

1153
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,940
這是勘測命令
Here's their reconnaissance order.

1154
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,370
上面說航天航空局2009年啟動
It say's NASA launched in 2009.

1155
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,270
看  記錄顯示王可能弄亂了代碼
See, forensics show Wang may have messed with the code

1156
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,950
以阻止他們對月球的遠端進行繪圖
preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon

1157
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,350
也就是陰影一面
which is also the dark side.

1158
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,840
真特麼了不起
Freaking awesome.

1159
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,900
他們跟我們交易  恐嚇我們
They pay for trade us, intimidate us.

1160
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,510
強迫我們幹些不法勾當
... coerce us to do their dirty work.

1161
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,790
一旦他們完成了
And once they're done?

1162
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,300
卡嚓
Dushhhh.

1163
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,570
就殺人滅口
The double tap cerebellum.

1164
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,310
所以這些人當時是在替霸天虎效力
So he was working for the Decepticons.

1165
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,270
我覺得這跟霸天虎
I don't think this is about the Decepticons.

1166
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,230
在找月球上的什麼東西沒關係
looking for something on the moon.

1167
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,090
我想是他們是想隱藏什麼
I think it's about something they wanted to hide.

1168
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,790
跟老爸過兩招
Come to daddy.

1169
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,540
來吧  認輸吧
Come on, fall down.

1170
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,560
你小時候生病吃錯藥了吧
Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?

1171
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,070
真是個怪胎
The freak.

1172
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,790
喜歡嗎
Hah, like it.

1173
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,630
我來教你
I'll teach you...

1174
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,870
先生
Sir.

1175
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,250
這堨縝b舉行一個高層的外星情報會議
Having a pretty high level alien Intel confab here.

1176
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,890
你還不夠資格出現在這塈a
That I don't think you're cleared for.

1177
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,870
-跑腿的  -是的  你是對的
- Errand boy. - Yeah, you're right.

1178
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,660
-這機器人真給力  -布魯斯  你該走了
- It's a bitchin' robot. - I think it's time to go, Bruce, okay?

1179
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,840
謝謝你讓我進來
Thank you so much for this.

1180
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,110
還是快走吧  布魯斯
Better go, Bruce.

1181
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,570
我都要冒煙了
Hey, I'm smokin' over here.

1182
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,680
還有失蹤的俄羅斯宇航員
Now with the missing Russian cosmonauts.

1183
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,750
蘇聯取消過一次載人登月任務
Turns out the soviets cancelled a manned mission to the moon.

1184
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,480
是在1972年
The moon, in 1972

1185
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,870
當時有2名蘇聯宇航員隱匿在美國
when 2 of cosmonauts went into hiding in America.

1186
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,830
我剛找到他們了
And I just found them, aaaah.

1187
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,190
你真是個天才  堮
You're a genius, Brains.

1188
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,130
這招真行  大黃蜂
Oh, that was smooth, Bumble Bee.

1189
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,870
差了一大截
Missed it by that much.

1190
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,510
你好
Hi.

1191
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,220
有人告訴我怎麼了嗎
Would somebody tell me what the hell's going on?

1192
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,230
你是誰
Who are you?

1193
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,170
-你是誰  -我是誰
- Who are you? - Who am I?

別碰我
Don't touch me.

1198
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,750
-我不會...  -山姆

1199
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,110
天使
Angel.

1200
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,670
我在工作

00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,960
對於這一切  我很抱歉
I'm sorry about this.

1202
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,830
很好  我們無家可歸了
Great, we're homeless.

1203
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,790
她住這媔
She lives here?

1204
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,600
你有機會搜她身
You had your chance to frisk her.

1205
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:51,920
我也有女朋友
I have a girl friend.

1206
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,140
是嗎  叫什麼
Really, what's her name?

1207
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,110
印蒂亞
Innn...dia.

1208
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,620
我們說好要去參加迪蘭的聚會  記得嗎 
We're suppose to be at Dylan's party, remember?

1209
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,250
沒忘  可你也知道  我那些朋友

...they need me. I have to be here right now.

1211
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,850
還有什麼  汽車人以及軍方
And what, the Autobots and the

1212
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,730
他們無法獨自搞定此事
military they can't handle this on their own.

1213
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,250
知道我喜歡你那些戰爭故事什麼嗎  山姆
You know what I liked about your war stories, Sam?

1214
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,630
因為它們只是故事
It's that they were stories.

1215
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:09,710
都是些過去的事情
They were in the past.

1216
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,150
聽著  我知道你想起了你哥哥
Look, I know you're thinking about your brother.

1217
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,800
還有你的家人
Okay, and you're thinking about your family.

1218
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,160
但這次情況不一樣
And it's not that situation.

1219
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,070
-不一樣嗎  -不一樣
- No? - No.

1220
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,040
怎麼不一樣
Why not?

1221
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:17,520
怎麼就不一樣呢  山姆
Why isn't it, Sam?

1222
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:20,730
你覺得我們是想讓我哥哥活著  還是想要獎章
You think we'd rather has his medals, or we'd rather have him?

1223
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,880
我知道  我明白
I hear you, I get it.

1224
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,850
你拿我的兔子去哪兒  站住
Where are you taking my bunny, stop.

1225
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,460
就等一下
Just stop for a second.

1226
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,010
你以為昨晚上我睡著了嗎
You think I could sleep last night?

1227
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,450
我終於明白  山姆想大冒險
I mean it hit me. No, Sam want's the big danger.

1228
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:32,600
沒有冒險就活不下去
He doesn't know who he is without it.

1229
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,660
我只想有人需要我
I just wanna matter.

1230
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,320
我需要你
You matter to me.

1231
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,490
我知道你是擔心我  我知道
I know you're worried, I know you're worried.

1232
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,670
但我向你保證  我可以搞定
But I promise you I can, I can handle this.

1233
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,810
能行嗎  你能保證嗎
Can you, you can promise it?

1234
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,010
我保證
I promise.

1235
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,690
山姆  我不想失去你  我知道這件事情的後果
Sam, I don't want to loose you, and I know where this leads.

1236
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,900
我還沒準備好
I'm not ready for this.

1237
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,320
你和我一起嗎
Are you coming with me?

1238
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,840
我辦不到
I can't.

1239
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,770
好吧
Okay.

1240
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,620
給你的腳
Here's your foot.

1241
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,780
真正的勇士得直面路途上的孤獨
A warrior's path is a solitary one.

1242
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,390
她怎麼買得起這樣的車
How the hell does she afford that car?

1243
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,110
-她老闆送的  -有錢的混蛋
- Her boss. - Rich bastards.

1244
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,330
我以前恨死這些傢伙了
I used to hate them.

1245
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,590
但現在...
But now it's...

1246
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,710
結隊去追捕兩名俄羅斯宇航員
Going to a gang on a hunt for two Russian Cosmonauts.

1247
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,160
沒有什麼比開著邁巴赫更爽的了  是吧
Nothing like driving in a Maybach, huh?

1248
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,400
告訴你  只有德國人真正懂車
Germans know how to make cars, let me tell ya.

1249
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,910
我這個管家  前國家安全局成員  
My Dutch man. Former NSA,

1250
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,100
網絡特別探員

1251
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,780
一路跟蹤他們至此
Tracked them down, here.

1252
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,250
這麼說這些宇航員想藏起來  為什麼呢
So these cosmonauts wanted to hide. Why?

1253
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,630
我看到一個目標
Bingo, I got a match.

1254
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,160
你簡直是只德國牧羊犬  管家
You're a German Shepard, Dutch.

1255
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,550
俄羅斯人
The thing about Russians is...

1256
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,030
都不喜言談
...they never like to talk.

1257
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,330
得用點全球通用語言
It's going to take a little of the international language.

1258
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,840
-Dos vedanya  -這是再見的意思
- Dos vedanya. - That means goodbye.

1259
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,090
誰來引領革命
Who's to get revolution.

1260
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,850
一個名人  不知道叫什麼
A famous, I have no idea.

1261
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:36,900
管家

1264
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,370
管家  你真沒用
Dutch, you suck.

1265
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,280
這是斯拉夫字母
It's a Cyrillic, alphabet.

1266
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,450
就像些計算器上你從用不到的案件
It's like all the buttons you never push on a calculator.

1267
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,610
不是我沒用
I don't suck.

1268
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,310
西摩·西蒙斯特工  外星交流部門的  已經退役了
Agent Seymour Simmons, CETI. Formerly Seta.

1269
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,550

1270
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,990
宇航員
Cosmonaut chicks.

1271
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,220
那又怎樣
So what?

1272
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,860
你本應航行到月球的陰影  然而
You were suppose to travel to the Dark side of the moon, then....

1273
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,020
忽然一切都取消了
It all got shut down.

1274
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,310
問題是
The question is.

1275
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:11,890
為什麼
Why?

1276
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,490
我的孩子可以在這吸煙嗎
Can my child smoke in here?

1277
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,120
好吧  沒事  好吧

1278
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,860
-開槍啊  -這個菜鳥是誰
- Yeah, shoot me. - Who was this delish, huh?

1279
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,900
我就是個司機  你呢
I'm only the driver in my country are you?

1280
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,680
你真漂亮
You are beautiful.

1281
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,040
沒人說你很漂亮嗎
Has anyone told you, you're beautiful?

1282
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,460
因為她就是個美人
'Cause she's a beautiful woman.

1283
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,430
管家  回籠子
Dutch, back in the cage.

Control your boy, please control your boy.

1285
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,750
管家  住手

1286
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,400
抱歉  這是老毛病 
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.

1287
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,080
好了  大家都冷靜下來
Okay, let's everybody just calm down.

1288
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,600
讓我們降降溫  把槍放下  放鬆點
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns. Just relax.

1289
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,060
第二次世界大戰結束了
World War 2 is over.

1290
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,930
你將看到的是前蘇聯最高機密之一
You're about to see one of the biggest soviet secrets.

1291
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,350
是美國人首次將人類送上月球
America first to send men to the moon.

1292
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,860
但首次將攝像機送上去的是前蘇聯
But U.S.S.R. First to send camera.

1293
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,560
1959年  我們的月球三號
In 1959 our Lunar 3.

1294
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,070
拍下了月球陰影  背光的那一側
take picture of the Dark, the shadow side.

1295
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:33,730
什麼都沒看到
See's nothing.

1296
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:39,980
-可是在1963年  月球四號看到  -奇怪的岩石
- But in 1963 Lunar 4 sees.. - ... strange rocks.

1297
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,830
-是的  -遍佈在飛船周圍
- Yeah. - Around the ship.

1298
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,480
數以百計
Hundreds of them.

1299
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,080
給  這是照片
Here, show picture.

1300
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:49,230
有一些拖痕
With some, drag marks.

1301
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,530
我看過  這些不是岩石
I've seen these, these aren't rocks.

1302
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,670
這些是傳送柱
These are pillars.

1303
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,770
外星人用來搭建太空橋的傳送柱
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1304
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,340
因為汽車人也有五個  所以我們知道
We know about them because the Autobots have five of these.

1305
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,780
霸天虎們肯定在阿波羅11到達之前
The decepticons must have

1306
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,690
襲擊了飛船
raided the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there.

1307
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:07,120
拿走傳送柱藏了起來
Took the pillars and hid them.

1308
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,360
這個說不通  霸天虎攻擊了飛船
Well that doesn't make sense. The Decepticons have the ship.

1309
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,310
所有能量柱都歸他們了  
They have all those pillars.

1310
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:11,620
如果說只有御天敵才能使用
Why would they leave several...

1311
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,260
為什麼還留下好幾個呢
... of these if he's the only one that can use them?

1312
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,740
除非
Unless...

1313
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,130
他們仍然需要他
He's the one thing they still need.

1314
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,400
我們得和御天敵會面
We got to meet up with Sentinel.

1315
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:21,040
跟他會合  並保證他的安全
Rendezvous with him, and keep him safe.

1316
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,790
米櫻  我剛帶上御天敵  擎天柱十分鐘後到
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel, Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1317
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,060
我們正在全速趕過去
We're coming in fast, now.

1318
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:29,090
威特維奇先生  我想我已經講清楚了
Mr. Witwicky I thought I made it clear to you,

1319
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,680
不要打這個電話
that I did not want you calling this phone.

1320
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,270
聽著  整件事情從一開始就是個陰謀
Listen, the whole thing has been a set up since the beginning.

1321
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,570
霸天虎想利用擎天柱找到御天敵
Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel,

1322
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,510
因為只有擎天柱才能讓他復活
because only Optimus could revive him.

1323
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,220
可是我們掌握著太空橋
But we have the space bridge.

1324
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,980
米櫻  你只不過有五個傳送柱而已
Mearing, you have five pillars.

1325
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,460
我剛剛得知他們有上百個
I just learned that they have hundreds.

1326
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,900
你被利用了
You're doing exactly what they wanted you to do.

1327
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,400
聽著
What do I need to say to you.

1328
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,820
霸天虎為御天敵而來
The Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime.

1329
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,320
立刻趕往鳥巢基地
We're going to NEST.

1330
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,500
收到能量警報
We have an Energon alert.

1331
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,290
正在追蹤
Currently tracking.

1332
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,490
三輛黑色車位於郊區
Three black suburban.

1333
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:38,570
大黃蜂  你得把御天敵帶出去  全速前進
B, you gotta get Sentinel out of here, you got to floor it.

1334
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,010
天啊  我還好
Oh man, oh I'm fine.

1335
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:55,690
小心點  小心點
Watch out, watch out.

1336
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:13,960
逮著了
Gotcha.

1337
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,660
開槍  開槍
Shoot him, shoot him!

1338
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,660
快開槍  大黃蜂
Shoot him, B.

1339
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,260
大黃蜂  快跑  再快點  再快點  大黃蜂  跑 
B, you gotta move. Faster, faster B, go!

1340
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,030
完了
Wipeout.

1341
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,210
好了  返回鳥巢基地
Come on, back to NEST.

1342
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,830
意大利人  我來追他
Dino, I got him.

1343
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,040
有問題嗎
Is there a problem?

1344
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,000
陷入小小的僵局
Whoa, little Mexican stand-off we got here.

1345
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:06,570
放下武器
Weapons down.

1346
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,010
這樣我們會讓你們有尊嚴地逃跑
And we'll let you escape with your dignity.

1347
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,060
放下武器
Drop them.

1348
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,650
很好
That's good.

1349
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,270
鐵皮  當心

鐵皮  拿著
Ironhide, catch.

1351
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:38,490
小心後面
Behind you.

1352
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:44,330
無恥霸天虎
Decepticon punk.

1353
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,850
解決
Class dismissed.

1354
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,770

到處都是霸天虎

1358

我已經出動全部人馬出去找了

1359
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,710
鐵皮

1360
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,010
保護好御天敵  把他鎖在堶

1361
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,310
包在我身上

1362
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,310
你的任務是守護好他  他是整件事情的核心
You gotta guard him, because he's the key to the whole thing.

1363
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,180
確實如此
Indeed I am.

1364
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:19,460
你必須意識到的是  我親愛的汽車人兄弟
What you must realized, my Autobot brothers.

1365
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,950
我們永遠也不可能贏得這場戰爭
Is we were never going to win the war.

1366
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:24,680
為我們星球的存亡著想
For the sake of our planets survival.

1367
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,890
必須與威震天
A deal had to be made.

1368
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,500
達成某種協議
With Megatron.

1369
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,150
退後
Get back!

1370
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,900
你做了什麼
What have you done?

1371
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:43,500
據此  我解除你的職權

把所有鳥巢部隊帶回基地

讓他們進來  帶進來  我們這堣H手不夠
Get them in, get them here. We don't have enough men.

1376
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,070
別招惹御天敵
Do not engage Sentinel.

1377
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,210
去後門
Just go to the back gate.

1378
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,500
長官  趴下
Director, down.

1379
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,790
快行動  快行動
Let's slide, let's slide

1380
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:38,830
走  跟上

1382
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,420

1383
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,270
御天敵
Hey, Sentinel.

1384
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:52,990
怎麼了
What is going on?

1385
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,600
你在幹什麼
What do you think you're doing?

1386
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,450
我是御天敵
I am a Prime.

1387
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,020
無須聽從你的命令
I do not take orders from you.

1388
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:05,950
米櫻指揮官快走  我們不是他的對手  快走
Director Mearing come on. We can't fight him, let's go.

1389
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,270

把屬於我的還給我

1391
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,550
天啊
Oh, my god.

1392
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,240
所有人出去  所有人出去
Everybody out, everybody out.

1393
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,650
大家保持冷靜
Everybody stay calm.

1394
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,320
看看  擎天柱
Yeah take a look, Optimus.

1395
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,760
這都是因你而起
This is all on you.

1396
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,260
御天敵攻擊了地下室
The Sentinel hit the vault.

1397
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,380
把傳送柱帶走了
Took the pillars.

1398
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,880
快來  我們走
Come on, let's go.

1399
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,090
這樣  通知101傘兵部隊
All right, notify the 101st airborne.

1400
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,120
我們得把東西追回來
We need to hunt this thing down.

1401
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,060
卡莉
Carly.

1402
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,460
篝火弄的  熱乎乎的
Hot from a little camp fire.

1403
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,610
曲奇餅
Smores.

1404
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,210
不錯吧  我們真的生活在世外 
Isn't this great, we are really living off the land.

1405
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,170
爸  媽  有沒看到卡莉回來過啊
Ma, Dad. Have you guys seen Carly come home yet?

1406
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,880
不好意思  你能先敲門嗎
Excuse me, can you knock please.

1407
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:16,870
這是我們的臥室
This is our bedroom.

1408
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:17,890
她為什麼不在家呢
Why wouldn't she be at home?

1409
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,280
我們吵架了  而且
We had a fight, and....

1410
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,390
我們可能已經分手了  或者正要分手  
We might have broken up, or be on a break.

1411
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,290
我也搞不清
I don't really know.

1412
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,030
-什麼  -聽著  我沒法談這個
- What!?.. Noo. - Look, I can't talk about it.

1413
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,320
-你開玩笑吧  -我
- You gotta be kidding me. - I

1414
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,880
現在沒功夫跟你談論細節  媽  我得找到她
can't go into details now, Mom. I have to find her.

1415
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,740
山姆  我們得開個家庭會議
Sam, we're having a family meeting.

1416
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,740
家庭會議
Family meeting.

1417
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,280
你可能還不知道  不過你爸爸和我
You may not know this. But your

1418
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,520
並不是一直以來都這麼愉快地相處
father and I were not always this perfectly happy.

1419
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,400
你知道在我們的婚姻中我也曾想過
You know there was a time in our marriage when I thought,

1420
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,710
這次過不下去了
"This is not going to work out."

1421
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,120
-你可以快點嗎  -我只是希望你
- Can you please hurry up. - I'm just hope you ...

1422
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,580
-能夠明白  -她損我呢
- .. just understand that you... - She's damaging me.

1423
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,350
你是和世界頂級的女人分手
...break up with one world class high.

1424
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,060
-不  停  停  夠了  -嗯
- No, stop, stop, okay. - Yeah.

1425
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,440
她甩了我  我就找個更好的
She dumped me, I moved to something better.

1426
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,490
沒錯  我更高興了
That's it, I'm a happier person.

1427
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:46,500
你想得美
It's not going to be as beautiful...

1428
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,260
-失去她  你為什麼失去她了呢  -幫幫我
- Lose her, why did you lose her? - Help me.

1429
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,530
-他們只是吵架了  -是打架了
- They had an argument. - We had a fight.

1430
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,840
好吧  可是你找不到第三個了
Okay, but you're not going to get a third one.

1431
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,660
除非你有個大...
I mean unless you have like a big...

1432
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,370
什麼  媽媽
What the, mom!

1433
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:55,530
媽  媽  我不想談這個了
Mom, mom, don't want to talk about it.

1434
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:56,290
你根本就不瞭解情況
I mean you just don't know.

1435
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,290
-隻是不想談  -你需要本書
- Just don't want to talk. - You need a book.

1436
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,760
跟她說你永遠都是錯的
You'll always wrong.

1437

-習慣就好了  -好的  這就是你要讀的

1441
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,570
-不  不  -坐下  坐下
- No, no. - Sit down. Sit down!

1442
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,810
立刻聲援
Back me up.

1443
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,380
有快樂的妻子  就有幸福的生活
Happy wife, happy life.

1444
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,070
-沒錯  -不快樂的妻子
- Yeah. - unhappy wife

1445
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,460
將會使得你的下半輩子慘不忍睹
Stone cold misery for the rest of your...

1446
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,670
-夠了  -這是事實
- Stop. - It's true.

1447
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,860
我只是想說
All I'm saying is.

1448
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,140
你愛這個女孩嗎
Do you love this girl?

1449
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,190
她就是我要找的
She's the one.

1450
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,830
那麼你就得想法得到她
Then you gotta go get her.

1451
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:25,070
我是說  你爸爸和我鬧矛盾的時候
I mean, your dad and I, when we had troubles.

1452
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:27,650
即便天涯海角他也會找到我
He moved heaven and earth to find me.

1453
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,710
不是嗎  告訴他你怎麼說的
Would he, say what you said.

1454
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:30,670
說啊
Say it.

1455
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,080
我會伴你左右  直到天荒地老
I would follow you to the end of time.

1456
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,970
-是不是挺傻冒的  -不
- Does that suck or what? - No.

1457
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,390
愛幻想的壞蛋
Bad syfy dope.

1458
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,840
我要你們盡量躲遠點  越遠越好
I want you guys to get as far away from here as you can.

1459
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,230
明白嗎
You understand?

1460
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,820
我愛你們
I love you.

1461
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,290
哦  主人
Oh, my master.

1462
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,250
您的計劃實在高明
Such a brilliant scheme.

1463
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,830
那麼  御天敵離開賽博坦的時候
So, when Sentinel left Cybertron,

1464
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,660
就是要叛變
...it was to defect.

1465
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,360
在命運將我們都打敗之前
He was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth,

1466
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,890
他本該和我在地球會合
before fate waylaid us both.

1467
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,520
能讓他復活的唯一辦法
The only way to revive him,

1468
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:22,880
就是擎天柱和矩陣
...we needed Prime and his matrix.

1469
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,170
天衣無縫的策略
Excellent strategy.

1470
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,820
所以他現在是您的夥伴了  主人
So he is now your partner, master.

1471
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,730
拉攏到他是我最大的勝利
He is my greatest triumph.

1472
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:44,980
真是嘆為觀止
So impressive.

1473
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,380
開始傳送
Commencing transport.

1474
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,470
住手  不  不  不  御天敵
Stop! No, no, no Sentinel!

1475
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,660
原諒我
Forgive me.

1476
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,640
我們就在這
Here we are.

1477
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,600
來打吧
Fight us now.

1478
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,800
汽車人  撤退
Autobots, retreat.

1479
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,430
為什麼  御天敵  為什麼
Why Sentinel, why?

1480
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,850
為了賽博坦
For Cybertron.

1481
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,100
為了我們的家
For our home.

1482
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,020
戰爭毀掉的東西  我們可以重建
What war destroyed, we can rebuild.

1483
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,050
但要與霸天虎聯合才有可能
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1484
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,040
不  不是非這樣不可
No, it's not the only way.

1485
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:28,550
這堣~是我們的家
This is our home.

1486
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,210
我們必須保護人類
We must defend the humans.

1487
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,340
你大錯特錯  擎天柱
So lost you are, Optimus.

1488
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,250
在賽博坦我們是上帝
On Cybertron we were Gods.

1489
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,680
而這堨L們卻叫我們機器
And here they call us machines.

1490
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,240
讓人類做我們的奴隸
Let the humans serve us.

1491
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,620
或者毀滅
Or perish.

1492
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,260
你該慶幸我沒殺你
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

1493
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,260
過不了多久  你就會明白的
In time, you'll see.

1494
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,570
這事沒完
It's not over.

1495
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,260
如果我是他
And if I were him,

1496
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,470
我會半刻也不讓你脫離我的視線範圍
...I wouldn't let you out of my sight for one second.

1497
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,530
真是好笑  一路以來我都在想
It's funny I was just thinking on the way over here,

1498
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,060
也許我該聽聽迪蘭的意見
I really could use some advice from Dylan.

1499
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,900
-你還真在這  可以跟你談談嗎  -歡迎光臨
- And there he is. Can I speak to you? - Welcome.

1500
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,150
請坐  喝點東西吧
Please sit down, have a drink.

1501
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,180
知道嗎  我不需要飲料
You know what, I don't need a drink.

1502
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:11,710
或者一輛汽車  或者一份工作
Or a car, or a job.

1503
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,230
我只想單獨跟我女朋友談談
I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone.

1504
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,880
沒什麼問題吧  燈泡先生
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

1505
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,820
失陪
Excuse me.

1506
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,830
-怎麼回事  -到外面告訴你
- What's going on? - I'll tell you outside.

1507
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,360
我真覺得可以幫到你  山姆
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1508
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,160
我還記得跟父親的談到艱難的選擇
I remember a talk I had with my dad once, about tough choices.

1509
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,170
現在不是時候  我有些事需要處理
Now's not the time, I'll set something up, though.

1510
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,350
那還要回溯到我爸爸的公司
'Cause that was way back when my dad's firm was in charge

1511
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,810
負責航空航天局的預算審核及報賬工作
of budget review and accounting for NASA.

1512
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:37,790
他教會我的事情是
You see the thing that he taught me was...

1513
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,120
戰爭本身與你無關時
When it's not your war,

1514
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,270
要跟勝利的一方聯手
you join the side that's going to win.

1515
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,740
太直接了嗎  還是我不討人喜歡
Too direct, or was it just me?

1516
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,240
顯然責任不在您  先生
Certainly not you, sir.

1517
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,580
你是我的
You're mine.

1518
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,610
-幫忙  誰能幫幫忙  -山姆  我出不去
- Get help. Someone get help. - Sam, I can't get out.

1519
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,330
-晚安  -晚安  迪蘭先生
- Goodnight - Goodnight Mr. Dylan.

1520
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,810
山姆  救我出去
Sam, get me out of here.

1521
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:17,860
救命
Help.

1522
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,060
救命
Get help.

1523
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,030
他還年輕  會懂事的
He's young, he will learn.

1524
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,640
-讓我出去  -晚安
- Get me out. - Goodnight.

1525
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,880
今晚很愉快
This was a fun night.

1526
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,330
你真以為自己是第一個
You really think you're the

1527
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:28,390
被要求介入一場宏大的外星人事件中嗎
first man ever asked to join a noble alien cause?

1528
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:29,380
你是誰
Who are you?

1529
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,640
知道為什麼自1972年後
You know why we've not

1530
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,890
我們沒再重返月球嗎
been back to the moon since 1972?

1531
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,030
因為這兩個傢伙
Because these two.

1532
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:35,790
他們來找我爸
They came to my dad and

1533
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:37,930
讓他在賬目中做些手腳
they told him to do some creative accounting.

1534
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,760
使得返回月球花費太高
Make it way to expensive to ever go back.

1535
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,250
所以他和其他人
So he and others, shut

1536
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,020
終止了美俄兩國的太空計劃
down the American and Russian space programs.

1537
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,470
而且自那以後他們就是我們的客戶了
And they've been our clients ever since.

1538
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:46,690
你還幫忙殺人嗎
You helped to kill people?

1539
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,110
有得選嗎
You think they give you a choice?

1540
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,810
此外  我也不是直接參與其中
Besides, it's not like I personally participated.

1541
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:50,810
我是個聯絡員
I am a liaison.

1542
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,160
負責聯絡
I liaise.

1543
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,070
這樣浪費時間就太沒誠意了  山姆
It's hostile take over time, Sam.

1544
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,700
山姆
Sam!

1545
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,320
讓她走
Let her go.

1546
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,000
山姆
Sam.

1547
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,070
我監視你好多年了  山姆
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.

1548
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,480
再也找不到比你更好的
You're the one spy I've never been

1549
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,750
能夠安排在汽車人身邊的間諜了
able to provide as the one close to the Autobots.

1550
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,270
山姆  別聽他的
Sam, don't do what he wants.

1551
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,500
不  他會的
Yes he will.

1552
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,090
像他們一樣
They all do.

1553
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,720
放聰明點  懂嗎
You should be smarter. You understand me.

1554
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,300
你眨眼的功夫
The time it takes you to blink,

1555
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,140
他們就會幹掉她  也會幹掉我
they will do it to her, and they will do it to me.

1556
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,130
所以當別人給你工作時
So you show a little respect.

1557
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,180
得有起碼的尊重
When someone offers you a job.

1558
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,810
手腕
Wrist.

1559
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,510
你要去跟蹤擎天柱
You are to track down, Optimus Prime.

1560
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,230
人類之中他只信任你
Because you're the one human he trusts.

1561
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,870
你去問他
You will ask one question.

1562
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,550
他打算如何反擊
How does he intend to fight back?

1563
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,860
策略  戰術  所有的東西
Strategies, tactics, everything.

1564
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,100
像被咬了一口  是吧
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it.

1565
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,520
高科技產品
It's very high tech.

1566
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,040
通過它  我們可以知道
It lets us see

1567
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,760
你看到了什麼  聽到了什麼
what you see, hear what you hear.

1568
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,290
而且它可以入侵你的神經系統
And it attacks your nervous system.

1569
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,940
所以別玩花招
So if you so much as try and signal.

1570
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,600
我知道要告訴你什麼了  山姆
I know what to tell you, Sam.

1571
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,140
關係產生結果
Relationships have consequences.

1572
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,630
我在這堿O因為我父親  
I am here because my father,

1573
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,310
她在這堳h是因為你
she is here because of you.

1574
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,380
別  別  別  別
Stop! Stop, stop...stop.

1575
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,160
震盪波  暫且別動她
Soundwave, if you please.

1576
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,120
山姆
Sam.

1577
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:26,530
完成你的任務
Do your job.

1578
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:28,710
她就沒事  我向你保證
She'll be safe. I give you my word.

1579
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,730
我會宰了你
I'll kill you.

1580
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,410
給我記住
You have my word.

1581
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,530
全體戰鬥員進入一級備戰
Combatant commands are now at Defcon 1.

1582
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,260
大約有兩百個霸天虎藏在暗處
Approximately 200 Decepticons are in hiding.

1583
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,890
南美和中國
Energon detectors have been

1584
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:47,630
能量檢測設備都被觸發
triggered as far away as South America and China.

1585
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:50,440
聯合國剛剛收到一份加密音頻文件
The U.N. just received an encrypted audio file.

1586
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,630
說是來自汽車人的領導者
They say it's from the leaders of the Autobots.

1587
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,080
地球的守衛者們
Defenders of Earth.

1588
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:57,950
我們為你們的自然資源而來
We have come for your natural resources.

1589
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:00,530
以此重建我們受損的星球
To rebuild our damaged planet.

1590
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,190
當運完所有我們需要的東西
When we have transported all we needed.

1591
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,530
就會還你們和平
We will leave your world in peace.

1592
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,050
要想獲得這種和平
For such peace to exist.

1593
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:13,210
必須立刻驅逐你們庇護的所有汽車人叛徒
You must immediately exile the Autobot rebels you have harbored.

1594
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:15,550
無商量餘地
Non negotiable.

1595
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,510
請與叛逆者斷絕關係
Renounce the rebels.

1596
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,090
等候你們的答覆
We await your reply.

1597
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,780
我們在中轉站聽你的匯報
We'll debrief you in transit.

1598
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,170
我不知道我對你們有何幫助
Yeah I really don't see how I can be of any help.

1599
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:25,220
你們個個都很忙
I mean you guys seem pretty busy.

1600
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,260
我們可再約時間
We can just do this another time, I think.

1601
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,270
每次我都低估了你
I have underestimated you at every turn.

1602
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,380
你  什麼
You..Ha...what?

1603
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,310
你提醒過我們說他們在利用人類
You warned us that they were using humans.

1604
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,200
而且你知道御天敵是關鍵
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

1605
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,130
長官
Director.

1606
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,770
我算老幾  你才是專家
Oh, who am I? Hey, you're the expert.

1607
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,560
我只是一個四處走動的危險人物
I'm just a walking security risk.

1608
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:50,520
你沒事吧
Are you all right?

1609
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,620
沒事
Yes.

1610
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:55,520
-不  你有事  看都在冒汗了  -沒事  真沒事
- No you're not, you're sweating. - No, I'm fine.

1611
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:57,280
沒事  我冒汗是因為我緊張
I'm fine. I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

1612
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,250
我緊張是因為
I'm nervous because you

1613
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,680
你告訴我這樣的秘密
got me in here for this information, okay.

1614
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:00,970
我是個微博控  什麼東西都往上寫  
I'm a twitter junkie, I blog everything,

1615
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:01,870
不能保守秘密
I can't keep secrets.

1616
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,030
-你不敢  -我在跟你說實話
- Oh you wouldn't dare. - That's the truth, I'm telling you.

1617
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:03,550
你不敢
You wouldn't dare.

1618
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:04,760
長官  十五號線有你的電話
Director I got a call for you at 15.

1619
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,070
你在幹嘛
What are you doing?

1620
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,350
沒幹嘛  你在幹嘛
Nothing, what are you doing?

1621
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,360
離我遠點
Get away from me.

1622
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,380
今天在首都發生了一些列重要事件
It's been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol.

1623
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,260
片刻之前  立法會
Just moments ago legislation was

1624
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:19,510
通過了驅逐美國領土上汽車人的法案
passed to exile the Autobots from American shores.

1625
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:23,050
美國軍隊同他們的聯盟正式結束
The U.S. Military alliance with them is officially over.

1626
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:24,590
-來自白宮的消息和  -是
- The words of the house and the... - Yeah.

1627
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:26,630
當局領導人回應今天的決議
..Authority leaders responds to today's resolution.

1628
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:28,490
-什麼  -我們不能故意邀請
- What? - We cannot in good conscious invite...

1629
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,930
他們不能這樣做  你的告訴他們不能這樣做
They can't do this, you gotta tell them they can't do that.

1630
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,830
好  這是官方決定  大家開始行動 
Okay, it's official, it's a go people!

1631
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:33,620
他們是我們的盟軍
These are our allies.

1632
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:35,140
汽車人為我們而戰  跟我們並肩作戰
The Autobot's fought for us, they fought with us.

1633
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,080
但我們現在什麼處境呢
And where are we now?

1634
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,550
面對著敵人的入侵
Facing an enemy invasion.

1635
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,670
面對著貪得無厭的敵人
With an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more.

1636
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,580
你還知道什麼嗎
If there's more you know?

1637
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,090
任何關於敵人意圖的消息
Anything at all about the enemies intentions.

1638
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,820
現在要告訴我們了
Now's the time to tell.

1639
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,960
汽車人沒法離開這個星球
Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.

1640
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:55,850
這一點你就錯了
That is where you're wrong.

1641
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:59,150
它名叫蒼耳
Its name is the Xanthium.

1642
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,060
帶來了第二批汽車人
It bought the second wave of Autobots.

1643
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,650
從那以後它一直由航空航天局看管和研究
And it's been under NASA's care and study ever since.

1644
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,140
我們把它與一部退役的航天飛機相連
We've linked it with a decommissioned shuttle,

1645
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,880
維持軍管直至離開
to maintain military control until they're gone.

1646
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,910
那破爛需要一萬磅的扭矩
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque

1647
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:13,320
我這邊不需要
on this cheaper Cheep... Oh, not my thing.

1648
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,730
你造成的破壞拖了大夥兒的時間
You damage this delays all me mates.

1649
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:17,560
那幾個就是營救車
That's your wreckers.

1650
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,210
他們看管蒼耳
They take care of the Xanthium.

1651
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,500
我們不太讓他們離開基地  
We don't let them off the base much,

1652
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,440
因為他們是一群混球
because they're assholes.

1653
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,500
你應該拉那頭  你這娘娘腔的賤人
You gotta pull that you Nancy wanker.

1654
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,400
這麼用力會弄壞的
It's torqued to kill them.

1655
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,330
冷靜
Calm down.

1656
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:32,410
-愛普斯  -你丫真蠢
- Epps. - You are ridiculous, that's you.

1657
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,380
你好  夥計
Hello, man.

1658
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:36,740
-你怎麼在這  -我從空軍退役了
-What are you doing here -I'm retired from the air force.

1659
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,190
能放手嗎
Can you let my hand go?

1660
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,160
那是什麼鬼東西
What the hell was that?

1661
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,840
現在我只是給他們當顧問做後勤
I went on to just consult and run interference for them.

1662
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,590
沒有戰鬥
No more combat

1663
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:47,030
沒有外星人在背後攻擊我
or alien shooting at my ass.

1664
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,280
我得到了一份夢想職業
I got a dream job.

1665
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,700
要把汽車人趕走
Kicking the Autobots out.

1666
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,740
你相信這是真的嗎
Do you believe this is happening?

1667
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,640
你認為要把他們送到哪
Where do you think is taking them?

1668
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:57,150
除了地球  隨便哪 
Any planet but here.

1669
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:02,760
我要找這堛滬t責人
I want to talk to whoever's in charge here.

1670
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,700
夏洛特·米櫻
Charlotte Mearing.

1671
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:08,880
西蒙斯特工
Agent Simmons

1672
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,830
前西蒙斯特工
Former Agent Simmons, so.

1673
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,660
我看到你在華盛頓倖免於難
I see you survived Washington.

1674
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,540
華盛頓  埃及  被人傷透心 
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.

1675
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,100
我都沒死  我以後也不會死
I survived, I will survive.

1676
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,000
他們把所有人都捲進來了  孩子
They're bringing everybody in, kid.

1677
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,050
把所有機器擺在桌子上
Putting all the Intel on the table.

1678
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,240
如果你認為把九個汽車人送走
And if you think that putting 9 Autobots,

1679
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,430
就能解決這破事
is going to solve a damn thing...

1680
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,520
這我管不了
It's out of my hands.

1681
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,450
平步青雲  是嗎
Moving up in the world, huh?

1682
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,880
你那活真不錯
Your booty looks excellent.

1683
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:39,340
如果你告訴任何人
You ever say word to anyone

1684
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,030
那晚在匡提科發生的事情
about what happened that night in Quantico.

1685
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,910
我就把你的心挖出來
I'll cut your heart out.

1686
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,650
我的心已經被你挖了
You already did.

1687
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,670
塞米  聽我說
Sammy, listen to me.

1688
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,770
別讓讓他們驅逐我們  
Don't let them exile us.

1689
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:50,060
別讓他們帶走我們  山姆
Don't let them take us, Sam.

1690
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,690
這是霸天虎的圈套
It's a Decepticon trap.

1691
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,100
檢查氮氣  我們要從這堸_飛
Checked the nitrogen, we're booting out of here.

1692
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:34,930
擎天柱
Optimus.

1693
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,250
你們首領說得對
What your leaders say is true.

1694
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,900
都是我的錯
This was all my fault.

1695
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,210
我告訴他們要相信誰
I told them whom to trust.

1696
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,260
我大錯特錯
I was so wrong.

1697
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:45,480
這不是你的責任
It doesn't make your fault,

1698
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,030
而是讓你變得更加像人類
it makes you human for a change.

1699
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,630
記住
Remember this.

1700
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,840
你們可以對我們失去信心
You may loose your faith in us.

1701
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:55,270
但千萬別對自己失去信心
But never in yourselves.

1702
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,210
我想知道你們怎樣反擊
I need to know how you're going to fight back.

1703
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,160
我知道肯定有什麼策略
I know there's a strategy.

1704
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,590
我知道你們會帶著援軍回來
I know you're coming back with reinforcements.

1705
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,020
我知道你們有計劃的
Something, I know there's a plan.

1706
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,360
你可以告訴我  不會有其他人知道
You can tell me, no other human will ever know.

1707
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,480
沒計劃
There is no plan.

1708
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,320
我們只是按他們的要求去做
We just do what they want,

1709
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,650
我們自己怎麼活下去
how are we going to live with ourselves?

1710
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:28,590
你是我的朋友  山姆
You are my friend, Sam.

1711
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:31,100
永遠都是
You always will be.

1712
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:34,040
但你們首領已經說了
But your leaders have spoken.

1713
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:36,770
從今以後
From here.

1714
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,640
你們只能獨自戰鬥
The fight will be your own.

1715
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,040
長話短說
Make it short.

1716
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,790
我們要起飛了
We're loading up.

1717
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:00,570
好了  快點
All right, hustle up!

1718
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,500
當力所能及時
When we do whatever we can.

1719
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,400
就做得漂亮點
make it like it was.

1720
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,900
你永遠是我的朋友
You will always be, my friend.

1721
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,300
山姆
Sam.

1722
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,900
我要走了
I gotta be going on.

1723
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,600
多年以後  他們會問我們
Years from now, they're gonna ask us.

1724
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:35,340
他們佔領這星球的時候  你們在哪
Where were you when they took over the planet?

1725
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,740
我們回答說
We're gonna say.

1726
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,440
我們只是袖手旁觀
We just stood by and watched.

1727
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:58,640
你應該把這看做合作
You should really look at this as a partnership.

1728
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,730
如果你想被載入史冊
You have to stand on the side of progress

1729
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,040
就應該順應潮流
if you want to be a part of history.

1730
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,640
準備發射  五  四  三  二
Go launch in..5...4...3..2

1731
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,040
一  零
1...zero.

1732
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,960
我要說的就是  你得逞了  
The word is, you got it.

1733
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,830
我總是心想事成的  山姆
I always get what I want, Sam.

1734
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:57,240
我們還要確認一下
We just needed to be sure.

1735
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,440
確認什麼
Sure of what?

1736
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,140
他們不戰而退
That they would go without a fight.

1737
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:13,640
-再說一遍  -探測到外來物體
- Say again? - Detecting a foreign object.

1738
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:07,170
我們現在全為霸天虎做事了
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1739
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:11,310
芝加哥  伊利諾斯

1740
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:13,440
我要你幫我追蹤一個電話
I need your help to track a phone call.

1741
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,340
電話那邊是個難得  他是人類行動的頭目
It's a man on this phone, he's the head of the human operation.

1742
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,540
他挾持了卡莉做人質
And he's holding Carly hostage.

1743
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,240
坐好  別動
Sit down, don't move.

1744
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,970
我正看著他開過來
I'm watching him drive up right now.

1745
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:29,630
已經鎖定電話線路
The call was placed in-route.

1746
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:32,130
我現在入侵電話的攝像頭
I'm hacking into the phone's camera right now.

1747
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,630
好了  從攝像頭傳回來的實時數據
There that is, that's a live stream from the camera.

1748
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:36,900
什麼地方  等等  我用三角定位
Someplace, hold on I can triangulate this.

1749
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:39,890
好了  是芝加哥的基站
Okay, it's Chicago cell site.

1750
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,090
那  找到了  
There, I got it.

1751
01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:43,290
川普大廈  芝加哥  稍矮的頂層公寓
Trump tower, Chicago, lower penthouse.

1752
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:44,490
我們行動
We're on.

1753
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:48,290
-我要去  -真的嗎
- I'm going. - You're sure.

1754
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:49,590
她在那堜t立無援
She is out there without any help

1755
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:51,640
我十五個小時就能到那兒
I can be there in 15 hours.

1756
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,350
你不會一個人去
You're not going alone.

1757
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:58,690
那邊還有我一些鳥巢部隊的朋友
Still got my NEST friends out there.

1758
01:31:58,690 --> 01:31:59,940
我們召集他們 
We'll round them up,

1759
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:02,250
去救出你的女朋友  再抓到那壞蛋
find your girlfriend and bring this guy in.

1760
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,550
為什麼你要幫我
Why are you helping me?

1761
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,150
因為那混蛋也殺了我的朋友
'Cause that asshole killed my friends, too.

1762
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,650
他們說來這堿O要我們的資源
They said they were here for our resources.

1763
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,050
去重建他們的星球
To rebuild their planet.

1764
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,650
是的  確切的說是一種特別的資源
Yes, really one resource in particular.

1765
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:31,950
地球特有的
One unique to our planet.

1766
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,350
我們
Us.

1767
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:39,150
你真聰明
You're very smart.

1768
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,750
沒有奴隸的勞動力  他們無法重建
You see they can't rebuild without a slave labor force.

1769
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,850
要發射多少火箭才能運送六十億勞動力
How many rocks up there in the universe offer 6 billion workers?

1770
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,150
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

1771
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,150
我們不能運人
We can't transport people.

1772
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,360
他們不是運人
They're not shipping people.

1773
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,780
他們把他們的星球運到這
They're shipping their planet here.

1774
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:58,750
我的天
Oh, my God.

1775
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:01,380
御天敵在這堸竣偵
What's Sentinel doing here?

1776
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,860
看
Watch.

1777
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:05,260
他們正在地球散佈幾百根傳送柱
They're spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now.

1778
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,860
幾小時之後
In just a few hours.

1779
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:08,460
把它們載入到軌道
They're going to launch them into orbit.

1780
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:11,160
把賽博坦運到我們的大氣層
And bring cybertron into our atmosphere.

1781
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,060
紅色的那根控制其他的傳送柱
The red one there, controls the rest.

1782
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,360
只要觸發它  就會啟動整個過程
He triggers that, it starts the whole thing.

1783
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:20,360
螻蟻工人滾吧  沒你的事兒了
Be gone insect operative, your work is done.

1784
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,710
是  閣下
Your Excellency.

1785
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:22,860
你真不要臉
You're such a dick.

1786
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,450
你希望這些發生嗎
You want this to happen?

1787
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:30,060
我想活  我還想多活四十年
I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1788
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,460
你認為我自找的嗎
You think I asked for this?

1789
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,960
我繼承了個客戶而已
I inherited a client.

1790
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,460
是啊  當賽博坦運過來  我們都成了奴隸
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here and we're all their slaves

1791
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,660
估計他們還是需要一位傀儡領袖
I guess they'll still need a human leader.

1792
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,960
說白了  你要想活命就得聽我的
Get this straight, you want to survive you listen to me.

1793
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:58,750
是時候讓地球奴隸們
It is time for the slaves of earth

1794
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,860
認識一下他們的主人了
to recognize their masters.

1795
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,660
封鎖城市
Seal off the city.

1796
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,260
把狗帶走  帶到後面來
Get the dogs out of here now, get them in the back.

1797
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,860
我才他們沒告訴你這部分  是吧
I guess they didn't tell you about this part, did they.

1798
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,260
你覺得我都知情嗎
You think I'm at every meeting?

1799
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:08,160
他們承諾我的安全
They promised I'm safe.

1800
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,260
他們說過我會沒事
They said I'm safe.

1801
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:24,260
出發
Let's roll.

1802
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,160
這堥S有信號
Don't have a signal reading.

1803
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,560
手機沒用了
It's not working.

1804
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,060
撤退
Move back.

1805
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,120
芝加哥被外星人飛船包圍了
There's a ring of alien ships around Chicago.

1806
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,800
我們的遠程炸彈在空中被擊落
Our high range bombers were just knocked out of the sky.

1807
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,680
無法衝破敵人在城市上空的空中防禦
They can't get through enemy air defenses over the city.

1808
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,250
我們的衛星被破壞了
Our satellites have been jammed.

1809
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,550
沒法監控敵軍的行動
We have no way to monitor the enemies movement.

1810
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,110
全部鳥巢部隊都撤退了
All NEST teams are on stand down.

1811
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:34,850
只剩空軍基地的兵力
Only have troops at air force base, move out.

1812
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:36,240
離戰區10分鐘航程
10 minutes from the battle zone.

1813
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,110
我們派出特種部隊爭取進城
We have special forces trying to gain access to the city.

1814
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:40,820
一個步兵團往周邊地區進發
An infantry is staging at the perimeter.

1815
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:43,220
聽我說  聽我說  這真荒謬 
Excuse me, excuse me, it just doesn't make sense.

1816
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,960
我們就不能派眼線進去嗎
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1817
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,080
他們不停地擊毀我們的無人駕駛戰機
They keep shooting down our drones.

1818
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,480
他們就是要我們看不見
They want us blind.

1819
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:52,380
但我們還有幾架小型遙控飛機可以一試
But we do have a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.

1820
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,880
如果我們可以操縱這些無人機
Well if we can man these UAV drones,

1821
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,980
我們可以把它們落向川普大廈嗎
...Can we try to redirect them toward, Trump Tower?

1822
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,180
那小子威特維奇正趕往芝加哥
The kid, Witwicky was on his way to Chicago.

1823
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,980
在霸天虎到之前
Set some point man human ops there,

1824
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,080
派小股偵查兵過去
before the Decepticons.

1825
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,580
聽著  據我所知 
Listen, if I know anything, I know this.

1826
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:09,580
那小子就是外星人的黑仔
That kid is an alien bad news magnet.

1827
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,580
我的天
My God.

1828
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:55,280
我們要在這種情況進城找她嗎
We came here to find her in the middle of all that?

1829
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,030
我們真要進去嗎  愛普斯
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1830
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,080
我不進去
I'm not going in there.

1831
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,580
沒人進去
No one's going in.

1832
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,280
我去
I am.

1833
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,680
有沒有你們  我也要找到她
With or without you, I'll find her.

1834
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,480
你這相當於自殺  山姆
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.

1835
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,680
這就是你來的目的嗎
Is that what you want?

1836
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,080
這就是你來的目的嗎
Is that what you want?

1837
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,960
你大老遠跑來就是要送死嗎
You came all the way out here to get yourself killed.

1838
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,860
聽到我的話了嗎
Huh? Listen...to me what I'm saying.

1839
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,460
她在這堨因為我
She's here because of me, do you understand?

1840
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,560
聽著  如果你進去
Listen, if you go in this building.

1841
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:28,360
就算她還活著
That's if she's even still alive.

1842
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,190
你也沒法救她
There's no way you're going to be able to even reach her.

1843
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:31,370
那你有什麼好建議嗎
Well what would you suggest I do.

1844
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,860
結束了
It's over.

1845
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,980
很遺憾  但都結束了 
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1846
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,780
不
No.

1847
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,940
敵人來了
Woah, incoming!

1848
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,050
我們會把他們全幹掉
We will kill them all.

1849
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:37,590
營救車  殺了他
Wreckers, kill him.

1850
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:43,490
這肯定很疼
This is going to hurt a lot.

1851
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,990
你們的首領現在應該明白
Your leaders will now understand.

1852
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:55,590
霸天虎不會放過地球的
Decepticons will never leave your planet alone.

1853
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:59,290
而我們要讓他們以為我們已經走了
And we needed them to believe we had gone.

1854
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:02,610
今天  以自由的名義
For today, in the name of freedom,

1855
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:06,070
我們向他們宣戰
we take the battle to them.

1856
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:29,570
我看著你們的飛船發射
I saw your ship blow up.

1857
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:32,470
我們沒上船
The ship, we were never in the ship.

1858
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:35,030
這是我們設計好的
We designed the damn thing, didn't we.

1859
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:38,270
我們躲在一級推進火箭堻Q分離出來
We were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate,

1860
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:41,420
按計劃落在大西洋
splashed down back in the Atlantic, just as planned.

1861
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,880
我們哪都沒去
We ain't going no where.

1862
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,080
沒人能驅逐我們
Yeah, no ones exiling us.

1863
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,580
汽車人仍然留在這
The Autobots are just staying right here.

1864
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:52,750
我們要幫你們打贏這場仗
We're going to help you win this war.

1865
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:55,740
他們環城形成防禦
They're surrounding the city to make a fortress.

1866
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,980
那樣就沒人看見他們在堶掠竣偵礞F
So that no one can see what they're up to inside.

1867
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,860
我們唯一的機會就是奇襲
Our only chance is the element of surprise.

1868
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,640
我想我知道該去哪
I think I know where to look.

1869
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:08,710
小型無人偵查機靠近川普大廈
Mini-drones on approach, Trump Tower.

1870
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,300
你是要告訴我  山姆要進去嗎
You're telling me, Sam's headed into that?

1871
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,460
可憐的娃兒
Poor kid.

1872
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,400
可能永遠接近不了
Probably never got close.

1873
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,490
你能開這東西  是嗎
Your gonna fly this thing, right?

1874
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,660
什麼意思  那是什麼意思
What does, what is that, what is that?

1875
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:26,740
還行
So, so.

1876
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:28,390
所以你還能湊合開
So you so, so can fly.

1877
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:29,590
這太可怕了
That feels terrible.

1878
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:33,340
我們支援你
We're right behind you.

1879
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:40,750
好吧
All right.

1880
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,990
我們進城
We're going in.

1881
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,700
城市被封鎖了
The city's secure.

1882
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:12,330
人類無法阻止我們
The humans cannot stop us.

1883
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:14,230
下午以後
As the afternoon falls,

1884
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:18,100
剩下的傳送柱會到達指定位置
the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position.

1885
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:23,470
這就是我多年以前向你承諾過的勝利
This is the victory I promised you so many years ago

1886
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,940
這就是我們重建賽博坦的地方
where we rebuild Cybertron.

1887
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,410
一起重建
together.

1934
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,160

You gotta shoot the pillar. You have to shoot down the pillar.

我們有八條街的距離
We're eight blocks away.

1952

需要靠近點才能開火

1953
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:51,350
不是靠近  而是要高點

我不能向你們保證能平安歸來

飛起來  我們走

轉向  轉向
More flap, more flap.

2032
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:34,860
注意六點鐘方向
Check your six, Check your six.

2033

2034
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:44,020
散開
Separate.

2035
01:52:49,450 --> 01:52:50,610
前面那棟樓是死胡同
Building, dead ahead.

2036
01:52:50,610 --> 01:52:51,830
我們穿過去
Thread the needle.

2037
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:02,860
打開降落傘
Pull, pull!

2038
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:07,290
過來  我們集合

爬上來真他媽累
This is a mother getting up here.

2040
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:09,760
趕緊帶著肥屁股滾過來

2041
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:10,510
就來
I'm coming.

01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:17,340
裝好火箭筒
Set up the rocket.

2043
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:19,760
快點  
Come on.

帶上爆破炸彈

2046
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:23,380
在D點有20人

2047
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:27,250
就是那  他們在那棟樓上
There, the building with the Prime.

2048
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:29,840
為了犧牲的兄弟們
For our brothers.

2049
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,610
我們要讓這次行動值回票價
Let's make this trip worth it.

2050
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:36,330
老天
Oh, oh God.

2051
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:40,220
樓怎麼了   樓怎麼了
Whoa, this building oh the building.

2052
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:46,300
他們在向大樓射擊
They're shooting at the building.

2053
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:51,140
這不是個好主意  
This is not a good idea.

2054
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:51,820
什麼
What?

2055
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:53,750
這不是個好主意  這樓不穩
This is not a good idea, the building's not stable.

2056
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:55,590
等等  我們不做能做的 
Just stop for a second. We don't do what we can do.

2057
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:56,700
那就沒意義了  反正我們都要死
Then it doesn't matter, we all die.

2058
01:53:56,710 --> 01:53:58,210
是吧  全看你了  加油
Right? It's your time, come on man.

2059
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:00,270
樓塌了我也沒辦法
I'm incapable of collapse.

2060
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:01,960
反正我有心臟病
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

2061
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,090
樓正往下倒
The building is going over.

2062
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:06,510
-抓住   -找掩護
-Hang on. -Take cover.

2063
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:26,090
好了  停下了
It's okay, it's done.

2064
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,780
大家  注意
Guys, look.

2065
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:29,040
敵人來了  
Incoming, incoming.

2066
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,160
都藏起來
Everybody hide.

2067
01:54:58,610 --> 01:54:59,530

火力掩護
Cover fire.

2070
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:22,540
打破窗戶  跳出去
Shoot the glass, jump out the window.

2071
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,700
跳
Jump.

2072
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:53,380
山姆  我停不下了

2073
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,590
打碎玻璃
Shoot the glass.

2074
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:22,390
山姆
Sam.

2075
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:49,000
大家都沒事嗎
Is everyone okay?

2076
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:51,100
你還好嗎
You okay?

2077
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:52,890
下面那是什麼鬼東西
What the hell was that?

2078
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,840
那個獨眼怪看到我了
This Zevo thing is looking at me.

2079
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:01,610
什麼
What?

2080
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:16,530
他還帶著一個扭動的霸天虎
He's even got a undulating decepticon with it.

2081
01:57:16,810 --> 01:57:17,760
往回走
Get back.

2082
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:38,900
它爬上來了  樓梯不能走了
It's coming up, the stairs are blocked.

2083
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:41,800
我們怎麼離開
Hey, how do we get out of here.

2084
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:42,970
快點
Hey, come on.

2085
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:45,760
上帝  只要讓我活著離開
Oh lord, just let me get out of this alive.

2086
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,740
我願意把養老金全給你
I'll give you annuities, and get it together.

2087
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:57,890
走  我們得離開
Move, we gotta move.

2088
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:59,950
為什麼霸天虎總是那麼牛逼

把手給我
Give me your hand.

2092
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:46,120
抓住她
You know, got her.

2093
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,270
把她扔到防火通道
Let's drop her to the fire escape.

2094
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:08,820
山姆
Sam!

2095
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:10,900
天  我們快走

下去  快
Get down, move.

2097
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:26,680
我來幫你們
I'm coming for you.

2098
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:23,920
擎天柱
Optimus!

2099
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:25,270
營救車  
Wreckers.

2100
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,600
我們來了
We're coming.

2101
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:29,830
全世界的霸天虎
Decepticons around the world.

2102
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:32,160
啟動傳送柱
Launch the pillars.

2103
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,750
我們被丟棄了
Ahh, we are so lost.

2104
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,390
我們總是被忽略
Always left out.

2105
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,860
但也不錯
Excellent.

2106
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,240
現在可以說了算了
It's time to lay down the law.

2107
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:15,770
給他們點厲害看看
By to be the hurt now.

2108
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:24,970
開始啟動了
They're starting.

2109
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:26,500
看到了嗎
You see it.

02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:30,500
找掩護
Get down.

2111
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,590
山姆和卡莉去哪了
Where is Sam and Carly?

2112
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:44,330
我們往這邊跑
We can run this way.

2113
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:53,230
我就交給你這一件事
I give you one thing to do.

2114
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,600
就是看好他們  你竟然都搞砸了
One thing to do and you drop the ball on that.

2115
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,010
我可從沒答應承擔這義務
I never signed for all of this.

2116
02:01:57,190 --> 02:01:59,430
外星人轟炸我  四處追我

I'm ducking in churches and

2118
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,890
窮於應付
buildings and all that kind of crap, maybe.

2119
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:03,510
去你的吧  我可沒答應這些  愛普斯
This is bullshit, I didn't sign up for this, Epps.

2120
02:02:04,870 --> 02:02:06,030
我盡力不吵了
I'm trying to keep it down.

2121
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:13,440
真是難得  就只有你們和我
What a treat, you and me.  Alone.

2122
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:20,660
快  快跑

2123
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:25,540
他是在追我  不是你
Okay, he's after me not you.

2124
02:02:25,890 --> 02:02:27,170
快逃

2125
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:31,080
臭小子  你無處可藏了

2126
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,000
跑  快跑

真是開心

2130
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:48,340
本以為你還會為我們效力呢  小子
Thought you were working for us, boy.

2131
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:54,430
山姆

- You've got to save him. - What is he doing?

2138

做好這管用
This better work.

2139
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:03,270
我看不見了
Ow, ow, ow. I can't see, I can't see.

2140
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:04,630
山姆

你們這些人類
You humans.

2145
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,010
炸彈還有二十秒爆炸

2146
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:16,690
什麼炸彈

我要把你們甩掉
I'll kick you.

2151
02:04:56,210 --> 02:04:57,120
他完蛋了
Well he's dead.

2152
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:02,150
好了  大黃蜂去召集其他汽車人

在河邊和我們會合

2154
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:04,210
明白
All right.

2155
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,820
他把我吸進來  我也沒辦法 
He sucked me in, there was nothing I could do.

2156
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:39,170
這堿O霸天虎的集簇群
Uh oh. This is a total cluster form.

2157
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,790
我們必須要過河
We gotta get across the river.

2158
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:42,940

You see that?

2159
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:44,860
卡莉說控制柱就在第一個圓塔
She said the control pillar is in that first cupola.

2160
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:47,550
走  我們行動
Go, move. Let's move.

2161
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:50,100
戰斧導彈已發射
Tomahawks are inbound.

2162
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,620
預計二十分鐘後到達
ETA, twenty minutes.

2163
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:55,090
我入侵了交通攝像頭
I'm in the traffic cameras.

2164
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,460
有四個汽車人被抓住了
Four Aubobots are captured.

2165
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,220
天啊  我們孤立無援了
Oh my God, we're helpless.

2166

2309
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:57,580
我得撤退
This step I must bend.

2310
02:17:58,440 --> 02:17:59,980
不

迪蘭

2316
02:18:37,590 --> 02:18:39,820
-好的  -不

2317
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:43,310
-該死  -迪蘭

2318
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:45,650
住手

2319
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:46,940
不
No.

2320
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:49,120
你不能這樣
You can't do this.

2321
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:50,110
知道不
Okay.

2322
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:51,940
我只有這條路
There's only one future for me.

2323
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:17,940
賽博坦

2324

最終
You are saved.

2325
02:19:20,570 --> 02:19:22,890
你得救了
At last.

2326
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:34,840
你是來投降的嗎
Oh, have you come to surrender?

2327
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,570
-這值得嗎  -當然
- Was it all worth it? - Obviously.

2328
02:19:37,570 --> 02:19:39,390
你用盡全力救回了御天敵

2329
02:19:39,390 --> 02:19:41,840
現在他擁有至高無上的權利

2330
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:43,650
你可真慘
It's actually almost tragic.

2331
02:19:43,660 --> 02:19:47,090
你竟敢教訓我  奴隸

2332
02:19:47,230 --> 02:19:49,720
你們霸天虎最終將征服這個星球

2333
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:50,940
但領袖不是你
And yet their leader wasn't you.

2334
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:55,440
是我  一定是我
It will be me, it will always be me.

2335
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,180
從此以後的每一刻
Any minute from now.

2336
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:00,380
他們會嘲笑你
They'll be laughing.

2337
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:02,680
你只是御天敵的婊子
You're Sentinels bitch.

2338
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,390
發射
Again!

2339
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:27,880
你選了陣營

2340
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:30,370
卻選錯了
You chose wrong.

2341
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:39,030
你一直都是我們中最勇敢的

2342
02:20:42,210 --> 02:20:45,090
但你卻從未做過艱難的抉擇
But you could never make the hard decisions.

2343
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:46,310
現在
Now!

2344
02:20:47,790 --> 02:20:50,610
我們的星球將存活
Our planet will survive.

2345
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:52,870
不
No.

2346
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:04,610
我們都曾是神
We were Gods once.

2347
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:05,900
我們每個人
All of us.

2348
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:07,110
但現在
But here,

2349
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:08,180
求你了
Please.

2350
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:10,650
只能有一個神
They'll only be one.

2351
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:25,690
這是我的星球
This is MY planet.

2352
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:38,260
我拯救了另一個世界
I just saved a whole other world.

2353
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:39,560
你認為你是英雄嗎
You think you're a hero?

2354
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:41,430
你認為你是英雄
Huh, you think you're a hero.

2355
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:42,400
不
No.

2356
02:21:42,670 --> 02:21:44,130
我只是一個送信的
I'm just a messenger.

2357
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:53,200
它還在傳送
It's still connected.

2358
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:56,670
小心  等下
Watch, wait up.

2359
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:58,920
-大黃蜂  -過來  過來
- B!  - Get going, get going. Let's move it.

2360
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,630
太空橋還在傳送
Oh it's still connected.

2361
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:02,950
讓它停下
Lets lock it that.

2362
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:27,440
不
No.

2363
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:29,970
我們先停戰
We need a truce.

2364
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:33,500
我只是要重新奪回領導權
All I wanted was to be back in charge.

2365
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:35,260
再說
Besides...

2366
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:38,350
沒有我  你也什麼都不是
Who would you be without me?

2367
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:39,640
御天敵
Prime.

2368
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:41,990
我們走著瞧
Time to find out.

2369
02:23:04,570 --> 02:23:07,660
擎天柱  我只是想  
Optimus. All I ever wanted,

2370
02:23:07,670 --> 02:23:10,390
拯救我們的種族
was the survival of our race.

2371
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:15,120
你要明白  我為什麼得背叛你
You must see why I had to betray you.

2372
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:17,420
你沒有背叛我
You didn't betray me.

2373
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:20,320
你背叛了你自己
You betrayed yourself.

2374
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:22,500
不  擎天柱
No, Optimus!

2375
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:19,310
山姆

你是我在這世界的唯一
You're the only thing I need in this world.

2379
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:06,920
我會盡一切可能補償你  我保證
And I'll do anything to make it up to you, I promise.

2380
02:25:08,150 --> 02:25:09,800
我會記住你的承諾
I'm gonna hold you to that.

2381
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:12,620
別再讓我離開
Just never let me go.

2382
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,360
我保證
Promise.

2383
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:21,380

Rings.

2384

2385
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:32,930
但  你別這麼心急
But, you gotta slow down.

2386
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:35,350
慢點來  好吧
You gotta slow way down. Okay.

2387
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:37,750
我只想幫忙
I'm just trying to help out.

2388
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:40,880
在任何戰爭中
In any war.

2389
02:25:41,050 --> 02:25:43,970
暴風雨間總有安寧
There are calms, between storms.

2390
02:25:44,710 --> 02:25:48,760
-你戰鬥很勇敢  -有時我們會失去信念
- You fought bravely. - There will be days when we loose faith.

2391
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:51,740
有時盟友會背叛我們
Days when our allies turn against us.

2392
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,480

2393
02:25:54,480 --> 02:25:56,960
放棄這個星球
That we forsake this planet.

2394
02:25:56,960 --> 02:25:58,540
也不會放棄人類
And it's people.

2395
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:24,810
這就是我所說的美好未來
That's what I called such a beautiful future

2396
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:27,440
逮捕他
Arrest him

2397
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,490
-這也值了  -把他帶走
- It's worthy it - Get him out of here

2398
02:26:29,490 --> 02:26:31,610
我剛證明她是愛我的  我不在乎
I just got her for the love. I don't care.

2399
02:26:31,610 --> 02:26:36,770
把我抓起來吧
I want going. Take me in. I want going. Let's going
