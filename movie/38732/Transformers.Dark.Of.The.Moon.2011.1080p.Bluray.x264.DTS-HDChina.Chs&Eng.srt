别人又不知道你拯救过世界  山姆

Government knows, but he doesn't give me a job right here in D.C.

138

不然太不公平了

我没时间了

159
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,600
我爸妈自驾游把世界玩了个遍
You see, my parents are going to be here in a week.

168
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,090
他太恶心了

他们被困在这里
They've been stranded here,

171
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,060
得有人看着他们
somebody's got to watch out for them, you know.

172
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,400
昨天他还藏在我内衣橱里
Yesterday that one was in my underwear drawer.

173
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,240
不错的选择  也很养眼

我还没说过那个字呢
You know I don't have the word yet.

178
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,720
要是你能分摊房租  我可能就说了

在外面都特么让我短路了
Frinking shorting my circuits out here.

181

让我们住在阳台的盒子里

旁边还是头畜生

184
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,280
-把我当动物养吗  -行了  住嘴

You know Sam, I don't know about moving in with this chick.

194
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,130
要是她像上个姑娘一样把我们甩了呢
Uh, what if she dumps us like the last girl?

195
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,960
我不喜欢她  太凶了
What she was mean, didn't like her.

196
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,950
我们得团结起来
Us guys got to stick together.

197
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,210

No, we're not family. You're a political refugee.

我们是高等智能外星种族
All right, we're an advanced genius alien race,

202
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
只想找个安身之处

我以为你们一周以后才到
I thought you were going to be here in a week.

218
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,190

-好吗  -知道我怎么想吗
- Okay. -You know what I think?

411
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,410
你想要的工作将在这个工作以后出现
You want the job after this job.

412
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,550
可是孩子  这份工作是你必经的一站
But son, this is the job that's standing in your way.

413
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,820
这就是为何你能非常胜任这个工作
And that's why you're going to be so very, very good at it.

414
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,230
因为当我看着你
'Cause when I look at you.

415
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,730
仿佛看见年轻的自己
I see a younger me.

416
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,900
机密鸟巢总部  华盛顿特区

417
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,820
全体运行中的汽车人变形汽车
All running Autobots in car,

418
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,320
十五分钟后开始训练
training in 15 minutes.

419
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,050
意大利人在二十三号车位报告

420
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,550
横炮在三十七号隔间进行武器测试
Sideswipe bay 37 for weapons assessment.

421
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,630
参议员  希望你记住  每当航天航空局
Senator, I suggest you remember that when the NASA

422
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,180
...需要资金  他们就给我打电话
...wants funding they call me.

423
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,630
中央情报局执行任务之前
When the CIA is going to take out a target.

424
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,690
也要得到我的许可
They ask first for my permission.

425
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,900
总统想知道哪位国会议员
When the President wants to know

426
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,200
在政治上不坚定
which members of Congress are politically vulnerable.

427
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,890
比如说未经发现的犯罪行为
In terms of oh, let's say undiscovered criminal conduct.

428
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,480
也会问过我
I'm on their memory dials.

429
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,000
美政府表示他们正对爆炸进行监视
USA agency say they have been monitoring the blast.

430
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,520
美国有线新闻网  伊朗发生工业事故

431
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,080
可事实上这是一起秘密军事袭击
But in fact this was a covert military strike.

432
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,330
目前没有任何国家表示为这起爆炸负责
No nation has yet claimed ownership.

433
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,930
中央情报局为中东发生的这起
The CIA is up my ass about this mystery...

434
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,810
神秘爆炸事件对我纠缠不休
..raid in the middle east.

435
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,050
是时候坦白了  部队是否参与此事
So it's time to come clean, was the unit involved?

436
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,450
不太清楚  女士
Uh, I'm not sure, Ma'am.

437
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,540
大家看好  就是这样对霸天虎
All right guys, this is how you do a Decepticon...

438
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,800
的头部进行致命攻击
...head kill shot.

439
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,500
作为国家情报局的指挥官
As director of National Intelligence,

440
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,470
我喜欢有点脑子的答案
I'm a really big fan of intelligent answers.

441
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,260
我  我实在不能明确回答您
I...I can't really tell you definitively.

442
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,110
这些汽车人就像十几岁的孩子
These Autobots are like teenage kids.

443
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,560
喜欢时不时地溜出去
They like to sneak out of the house once in a while.

444
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,180
兰诺克斯上校  你究竟是不是指挥官 
Colonel Lennox, are you in command or are you not?

445
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,500
是的  女士  我是
Yes, Ma'am. I am....

446
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,520
别叫我女士  受够了
Stop with the Ma'am, enough with the Ma'am.

447
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,790
我看起来有那么老吗
Do I look like a Ma'am?

448
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,760
没有  女士  
No, ma'am.

449
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,470
是  女士  是
Yes, ma'am, yes.

450
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,960
-这是我最好的一件发明  -不错
- This one is a perfect invention I have made. - Right.

451
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,110
太好了  他们来了
Oh, good they're here.

452
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,560
我叫齐  希望你们能解答他的疑问
My name's Que. I do hope you have answers for him.

453
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,990
我从没见过他这么心烦
I've never seen him so upset.

454
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,010
擎天柱  记得夏洛特・米樱吧
Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing?

455
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,480
国家情报局的主管
Our director of National Intelligence.

456
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,400
他心情不好
He's in a bad mood.

457
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,750
他今天谁都不想理
He's a not want to talk-a to anybody today.

458
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,350
这算什么
What is this?

459
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,030
安静疗法吗
The silent treatment?

460
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,920
我们见过那种  这次不是
We've seen that, and this is not that.

461
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,510
-绝对不是  -这次更糟
- Definitely not. - This is worse.

462
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,040
擎天柱  你自己说
Prime, make something of yourself.

463
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,400
他很生气
He's pissed.

464
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,020
你们骗了我们
You lied to us.

465
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,960
你们告诉我们
Everything humans' know of our planet

466
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,140
说已经共享了所有对我们星球已知的情况
we were told had all been shared.

467
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,320
那为什么人类的土地上会发现这玩意
So why was this found in human possession?

468
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,270
这事儿我们也不知道
We were in the dark on this also.

469
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,370
今天以前只有主管能进入第7区
It was director only clearance at Sector 7, until now.

470
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,830
-把包拿来  -哪个包
- The bag. - Which bag?

471
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,910
铂金女士包  绿色鸵鸟皮的
Hermes Birkin, green ostrich.

472
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,460
真受不了
Oh my god.

473
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,860
这是个鲜为人知的秘密
This is a secret few men knew.

474
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,770
知情人也死得差不多了
And fewer still remain alive.

475
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,170
请允许我向你介绍
Allow me to please introduce to you,

476
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,680
建立航空航天局的两位主管
two of NASA's founding mission directors.

477
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,030
以及宇航员  波兹・阿尔德林博士
and astronaut, Dr. Buzz Aldrin.

478
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,180
最先登陆月球的两人之一  长官
One of the first two men to step foot on the moon. Sir.

479
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,490
擎天柱
Optimus Prime.

480
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,060
作为后进的宇宙旅行者
From a fellow space traveler.

481
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,870
见到你很荣幸
It's a true honor.

482
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,710
我也很荣幸
The honor is mine.

483
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,110
我们整个六十年代的太空竞赛
Our entire space race of the 1960's...

484
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,760
好像都是对某一事件的回应
...it appears was in response to an event.

485
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,370
我方宇航员对一架坠毁的外星飞船进行调查
Our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship.

486
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,990
舱内无人生还
No survivors on board.

487
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,480
在总指挥的命令下  我们发誓对一切保密
We were sworn to secrecy by our commander in chief.

488
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,090
这是一项永不能提及的任务
This was a mission you will never speak of.

489
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,010
明白  长官
I understand, sir.

490
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,530
航空航天局里共有35人知道真正的计划
A total of 35 people knew the real plan at NASA.

491
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,780
苏联人成功向月球发射了无人探测器
Soviets managed to land unmanned probes.

492
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,090
他们一定是以某种方式得到了燃料棒
Somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod.

493
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,930
我们认为俄国人的推断出
We believe the Russians deduced

494
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,470
那只燃料棒是可裂变燃料装置
that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly.

495
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,930
认为他们在切尔诺贝利对其监管及控制
Believed they had it mastered and harnessed it at Chernobyl.

496
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,930
切尔诺贝利  苏联欧洲部分中西部城市

497
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,090
我们接下来总共进行了六次任务
We went on six missions in all.

498
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,980
拍摄了大量照片和取样
We took hundreds of photos and samples.

499
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,740
把它们永久性的封存起来
We locked them away forever.

500
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,670
而月球项目从此停止
And the moon program was shut down.

501
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,140
你们在哪儿找到坠毁残骸的
Where did you search the crash hold?

502
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,070
飞船的名字叫做方舟
The ships name was the Ark.

503
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,490
我目睹它从赛博坦逃走
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

504
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,410
里面搭载着一项汽车人技术
It was carrying an Autobot

505
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,040
能让我们赢得战争
technology which would have won us the war.

506
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,590
里面还有机长
And its captain.

507
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,450
-机长是谁  -伟大的领袖  御天敌
- Who was this captain? - The Great Sentinel Prime.

508
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,300
发明这项技术的人
The technology's inventor.

509
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,740
他曾是汽车人的指挥官
He was commander of the Autobots.

510
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,950
是我的前任
Before me.

511
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,060
当务之急是
It's imperative that I find it

512
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,160
我必须在霸天虎知道具体位置之前找到它
before the Decepticons learn of its location.

513
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,010
我们汽车人的宇宙飞船可以到达那里
Our Autobot space craft has the ability to get there.

514
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,690
而你们只能祈祷这还来得及
And, you must pray it's in time.

515
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,080
我想见卡莉・斯宾塞
Hi, I'm here to see Carly Spenser.

516
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,130
卡莉

- Do you like me a little more? - A little bit, yeah.

522
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,800
我对这座太空山
I'm seriously curious about

523
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,730
真的很好奇
this space mountain.

524
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,040
我知道  这里很美吧
I know, isn't it beautiful in here?

525
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,230
老板也酷毙了
And he's the coolest guy, ever.

526
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,070
-是吗  -没错

530
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,500

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,070
卡莉常跟我提起你
Carly has told me a lot about you.

532
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,770
彼此彼此  你这栋房子真不错 
Well, visa versa. It's a beautiful building you got.

533
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,900
简直就是星际迷航里的企业号
The Star Ship Enterprise here.

534
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,720
谢谢夸奖  这里漏雨
Thank you very much, it leaks.

535
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,650
在卡莉来帮忙整理藏品之前
Ah, before Carly came to help on the collection

536
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,680
这里一团糟
it was just a complete mess.

537
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,510
不过现在修复重回正轨了
But now the restorations are back on track.

538
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,860
今年我要再战圆石滩
I'm going to pebble beach this year,

539
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,930
再赢个奖杯放在那儿
going to need a trophy for that stand right there.

540
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,980
知道为什么吗
You know why?

541
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,940
因为你身边这位大美人儿
Because this woman right here,

542
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,310
正是我的秘密武器 很好  
...is my secret weapon. Okay.

543
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,480
古尔德先生  拜托 你太夸张了
Mr. Gould please, you exaggerate.

544
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,070
我只负责安排事宜而已
All I've done is get you organized.

545
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,400
你可远不止这样  管家婆

她真可爱
She's adorable.

549
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,630
我从英国大使馆把她挖走的时候
You know when I stole her away from the British Embassy,

550
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,700
我说过  管理一个国家容易
I said, it's easy to manage a country.

551
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,860
管理物价的艺术藏品没那么简单
Try managing a priceless collection of art.

552

00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,730
我父亲有一张十块钱的桌子和一个梦想
My dad had a ten dollar desk and a dream.

560
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,580
由此他建立了一家大企业

561
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,550
我们是美国最大的会计师事务所

562
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,040
我的商业投机是在他过世之后才开始的
I started off the adventure side after he passed.

563
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,390
未来就会如此
That's in the future.

564
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,940
在成功者身上下注
Try and bet on the winners.

565
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,960
收藏汽车让我保持清醒

裤子够紧的
Jeans are tight.

570
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,430
来吧  来吧

571
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,510
看见了吗
You see that?

572
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,620
以貌取人  看我开破车就看不起我 
Judgment, judge to my car.

573
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,140
你还等着他看不起我吗
You going to wait on him while he's judging me?

574
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,800
你怎么啦  他是我老板
What's with you? He's my boss.

575
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,540
我们吃的住的花得都是他的钱
He still pays for our food, our rent.

576
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,530
不是  我完全理解
No, I totally understand.

577
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,190
我一点都不在乎  我明白  我被养活得不错 
I'm totally fine, I get it. I'm well fed.

578
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,900
你猜怎么着  我不再当你的小白脸了
Guess what, I'm not your boy toy anymore.

麻烦上车  管家婆
In the car, thank you Duchess.

582
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,260
天哪  你吃他的醋吗
Oh, my god, are you threatened by him?

583
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,700
吃醋  我为什么吃醋
Threatened, what am I threatened by?

584
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,370
为他的钱  权  还是脸蛋儿吃醋
His money, his power, his good looks?

585
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,810
都不是  就选这个
None of the above, check!

586
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,870
你耍小孩子脾气的样子太性感了

587
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,090
拜托上车吧

588
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,330
山姆  向我谄媚的不是他一个 
Sam, he's hardly the first man to ever smile at me.

589
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,210
我觉得我能处理好
I think I can handle it.

590
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,820
等等  是你对他的回应让我不爽 
Hold on, hold on. It's..It's the smiling back part that gets me.

591
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,970
-知道吗  -不再对他笑了
- Okay. - No more smiles.

592
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,430
再也不笑了  我保证
Never again, I promise.

593
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,680
你看  我就吃这套 
You see, that works for me.

594
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,350
别急  别急
Easy, easy.

595
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,740
这么弄可发动不起来
You're not going to get it started that way.

596
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,490
什么  我就是让它预热一下

我差不多做完了32%的修复工作

Chrome work, put a spoiler on the back, done deal.

599
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,690
卡莉一直跟我说你为找不到工作烦心
You know Carly's been telling me you've been struggling job loss.

600
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,970
然后你都知道了
Just so you know.

601
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,950

您看起来不太好  主人

630
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,250
把里面的东西带回来了

What's this hoochee around here?

644
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,240
是因为...
Just because...

645
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,920
不行  我们公司做的是航空工业

There's no ladder climbing in my office. I run a tight ship.

654
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,310
-是的  先生  -很好  去干活

一下可看不完

你要忘了这个人  把他停车位上的名字撤下来
You forget his person, get his name off his parking space.

823
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,400
我们什么时候买了个新的复印机
Hey, when did we get a new copier?

824
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,670
我看到的事情我绝不透露半个字
See, I'm not gonna say anything about what I saw?

825
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,550
你跟谁共用一个厕所完全是你的事
Who you share a toilet stall with is totally your business.

826
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,890
这绝对是日货
This is exceedingly Japanese.

827
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,720
日货总是这么难搞
They never make it easy.

828
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,730
你怎么了
What is with you?

829
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,940
这事很重要  卡莉
This is the really deal, Carly.

830
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,170
好吧  我要你保持镇静
Okay, I need you to stay composed.

831
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,220
是真的  我一会儿给你解释
It's real life, I'll explain to you later.

832
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,450
这是紧急情况  帮我联系兰诺克斯上校
We got an emergency, you gotta get Colonel Lennox in here.

833
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,020
跟霸天虎有关  霸天虎回来了
On point decepticons, the deceptions are back again.

834
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,500
-马上给我把那门打开  -冷静  先生
- You gotta open that gate up right now. - Easy, sir.

835
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,820
这里是卫生和人类服务部
This is health and human services.

836
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,340
好吧  都装备上M-4了
Right, packing M-4's?

837
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,360
M-4是卡宾枪的一种型号  用于部队实战

838
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,720
这么大阵势要保护什么  结肠袋吗
What are you protecting, colostomy bags?

839
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,270
-便盆还是止咳糖  -宝贝儿
- Bed pans, throat lozenges? - Babe.

840
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,810
你们的帽子哪里来的  护士学校吗
Where did you get that hat from? Nursing school?

841
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,520
所以你们是在保护护士跟足光粉吗
So your are nurses and foot powder protector.

842
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,870
-很好  不错  -宝贝儿  我觉得我们
- Oh, fantastic, yes. - Baby, I don't think we're in....

843
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,150
-找错地方了  -我们没有找错地方
- ... the right place. - We are in the right place.

844
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,120
我们没有找错地方
We are in the right place.

845
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,940
我们没有找错地方
We are in the right place,

846
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,070
我马上要跟擎天柱说话
and I want to talk to Optimus right now.

847
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,150
你现在去给我找擎天柱
You're going to get me Optimus right now.

848
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:51,990
我想你找错地方了
I'm sure you got the wrong building.

849
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,860
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

850
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,790
霸天虎回来了  你听不懂吗
What part of the Deceptions are back don't you understand?

851
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,600
你能放聪明点吗
You're being a smart ass.

852
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,540
不要砸我的车  这可是收藏品
Do not hit my car, it's a collector's item.

853
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,150
要是我就不会这么干
I wouldn't do that.

854
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,200
你真是疯了
You're crazy.

855
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,100
检测到有能量块
We got an Energon reading.

856
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,590
车上那么少可能会被忽略
We got Missed it by that much in the vehicle.

857
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,380
-不许动  -我们不动
- Freeze! -Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're freezing.

858
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,260
你是不是...
Are you...

859
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,540
请从车里出来
Please get out of the car.

860
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,090
-我抓住他了  快走  -大黄蜂
- I got him, go. - Bee!

861
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,310
大黄蜂在吗
Is Bee in there?

862
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,910
-好吧  你抓住我了  -趴下
- Okay, you got me. - Stay down.

863
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,470
你就是这么对待汽车人的
This how you treat Autobots?

864
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,680
我们是一条战线上的
We're on the same team.

865
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:35,410
好好享受你以后在7-11的工作吧  混球
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-11, dickhead.

866
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,270
-好吧  -混蛋
- That's right. - A-hole.

867
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,550
现在瞧瞧你的车吧
How's your car now?

868
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,420
那才是我的车
That's my car.

869
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,620
过来
Come here.

870
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:52,930
过来
Come here!

871
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,950
别这样  山姆
Come on... Sam.

872
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,560
你怎么回事
What is your deal, huh?

873
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,320
我知道你们的什么秘密行动很重要
I know your black ops stuff is important.

874
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,310
要知道我不是想拦着你
You know I'm not trying to diminish it,

875
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,550
让你内疚或者怎么样的
or guilt trip you, or anything.

876
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,740
但是我好久没见到你了
But I just never see you anymore.

877
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,300
你就不能回来车库呆一个晚上吗
You can't come to the garage and stay on one night?

878
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,710
山姆  你这么说我很难过
Sam, that makes me feel bad.

879
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,680
我真希望你难过  你就应该难过
Yeah, well, I hope you feel bad, you should feel bad.

880
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,740
看看我现在开的这个老破车
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.

881
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,980
我每天都觉得很难过
I feel bad every single day.

882
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,750
跟我来  你们俩
Yo, let's go, both of you.

883
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,740
兰诺克斯要见你们
Lennox wants to see you.

884
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,210
怎么了  现在我们就配不上你了吗
What, we're not good enough for you anymore.

885
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,980
抱歉  宝贝儿  他们很粗鲁  对吗
Sorry, babe, they were very rude, right.

886
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,890
你给我把车修好
And you're fixing my car.

887
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,540
你反对吗
You don't think so?

888
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,600
要是你今天遇到了一个会飞的变态
Raise your hand if you had a

889
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,050
复印机隐者杀手  请举手 
flying psycho ninja copier try to kill you today.

890
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,330
那些是我的铜指节
Those are my brass knuckles.

891
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,280
那是我脚环  需要我把那个也脱下来吗
That's my anklet, do I have to take that off too?

892
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,390
还有我脚趾环
And my toe rings?

893
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,310
全部无关人员撤离本
All the unofficials clear the floor.

894
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,370
距离接触行动  还有十分钟
We have ten minutes until attempted contact.

895
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,060
我们已经拿到
We've taken possession of

896
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,980
藏在御天敌飞船上的五个设备
the five devices that were hidden in the ship of Sentinel Prime.

897
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,220
某种程度上说他们是汽车人的原型科技
They're some kind of prototype Autobot technology.

898
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,960
他们说御天敌是他们文明里的爱因斯坦
They say Sentinel was the Einstein of his civilization.

899
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,490
所以我们要把这些锁起来
So we're going to keep these locked up,

900
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,020
直到我们弄清楚这些是什么
... until we know what we're dealing with.

901
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,270
现在不许任何人接近
Right now no one gets access.

902
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,470
-任何人  -今早有个人认出我来了
- No one. - This morning a guy recognized me.

903
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:54,860
他让我来提醒你
He told me to warn you,

904
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,080
他说到月之阴影
he's talking about the dark side of the moon.

905
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,090
-然后他们把他杀了  -等一下  你说月亮
- Then they killed him. - Wait a minute, you mentioned the moon?

906
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,290
是啊  月之阴影 
Yeah, dark side of the moon.

907
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,800
但是为什么霸天虎想要杀害人类呢
But why would the decepticons want to kill humans?

908
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,090
我以为他们的敌人是汽车人
I thought their war was with the Autobots.

909
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,390
这是他第一次做定时报告的时间
And that is when he made his first quick list of time report.

910
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,470
这就是我想要的
That's what I want..

911
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,440
那个女的是谁  好的
Who's the chick, okay.

912
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,450
请问  兰诺克斯上校
Excuse me, Colonel Lennox.

913
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,490
米樱局长
Director Mearing.

914
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:13,790
这位是山姆・威特维奇
This is Sam Witwicky.

915
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,510
-一个平民  -我知道他是谁  上校
- A civilian c.. - I know his name, Colonel.

916
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,020
我想知道谁让他进来的
I want to know who gave him clearance.

917
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,730
谁让我进来的  不如说是擎天柱
Who gave me Clearance? How about Optimus Prime.

918
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,770
在他降落在郊区寻找我房子的时候
When he touched down in suburbia looking for my house.

919
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,900
这位是国家情报局主管
This is the national intelligence director.

920
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,190
要是你...
In case you...

921
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,260
-你好  -藐视国家官员
- Hi. - Disrespecting a federal officer.

922
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,050
你应该知道后果的  她是谁
That ought to get you somewhere, who's she?

923
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,110
她是我女朋友
She's my girlfriend.

924
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,140
这算怎么回事  约会吗
What is this like a date?

925
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,950
她知道所有汽车人的事情
She knows all about the Autobots, okay.

926
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,320
她知道大黄蜂  而且她来自军人的家庭
She knows Bumblebee, and comes from a military family.

927
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,250
我可以替她担保
I can vouch for her.

928
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,410
我有一个主意
Hey, I have an idea.

929
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,860
不如我们说回那个重要的话题
How bout we get back to the important topics?

930
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,370
比如说我的脸差点被霸天虎切下来
Like the fact I almost had my face cut off by a Decepticon.

931
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,800
事实上  作为一个纳税人  我可以投诉的
As a tax payer I can lodge a complaint as a matter of fact.

932
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,850
好了  听着
Okay, listen.

933
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,440
山姆公司的一个软件工程师今天被杀害了
One of the software engineers at Sam's office was murdered today.

934
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,500
他参与过太空总署的月球绘图探测
He was involved in NASA's Lunar mapping probe.

935
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,280
事情是这样的  兰诺克斯上校
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

936
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,050
我们不能把国家安全托付给年轻人
We cannot entrust national security to teenagers.

937
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,000
除非说有什么政策我不知道
Unless I missed the policy paper.

938
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,100
有吗
Are we doing that now?

939
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,240
没有  很好
No, good.

940
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,170
我不管你是谁
I don't care who you are.

941
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,010
要是你把在这里看到的说出去一个字
If you breathe a word of what you've seen here.

942
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,510
就以叛国罪把你扔进监狱
You will do time for treason.

943
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,030
明白了吗
Do you understand me?

944
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,180
我只听汽车人的命令
I'll take my orders from the Autobots.

945
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,630
我认识他们  我不认识你
I know them, I don't know you.

946
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,390
你会认识我的
You will.

947
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,960
御天敌
Sentinel Prime.

948
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,680
他是靠能量块维持生存  他已经用完了
He seems to run on Energon, and he's out of it.

949
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,980
他现在是在睡眠模式
He's in a sort of a sleep mode.

950
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,470
开始吧
Let us begin.

951
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,380
这就是伟大的领袖矩阵
It's the great matrix of leadership.

952
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,030
他掌握着宇宙中仅有的一样东西
He holds the only thing in the

953
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,520
能够重新启动变形金刚的火种
universe that can repower a Transformers spark.

954
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,020
太不可思议了
This is incredible.

955
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,800
御天敌
Sentinel Prime.

956
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,060
我们欢迎你回来
We bid you return.

957
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,470
复仇
Revenge.

958
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,280
-不  -不要开枪
- No. - Hold your fire.

959
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,640
-不要  御天敌  -不要开枪
- No, Sentinel. - Hold your fire.

960
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,240
是我  擎天柱
It is I, Optimus Prime.

961
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,820
没事了
It is all right.

962
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,070
你安全了
You are safe.

963
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,700
没什么好怕的
There's nothing to fear.

964
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,640
我们来了
We are here.

965
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,180
你回家了  御天敌
You are home, Sentinel.

966
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,200
战争
The war?

967
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,510
战争
The war!

968
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,920
我们输了
The war was lost.

969
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,560
赛博坦现在已经成了不毛之地
Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland.

970
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,420
我们在地球避难
We have taken refuge here on Planet Earth.

971
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,200
人类是我们的盟军
Its human race is our allies.

972
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,460
我的飞船呢
My ship?

973
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,450
我们遭遇了袭击
We came under fire.

974
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,670
传送柱
The pillars.

975
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,220
传送柱在哪里
Where are the pillars?

976
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,250
你保住了五根
You saved five of them.

977
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,110
包括控制柱
Including the control pillar.

978
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,680
只有五根吗
Only five?

979
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,070
我们以前有上百根的
We once had hundreds.

980
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,990
打扰一下  先生们  我能问问
Excuse me, gentlemen. May I ask,

981
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,080
你们要寻找的科技是什么吗
what is this technology you're looking for?

982
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,030
它具有重塑宇宙的能力
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

983
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,710
集结所有传送柱就能形成空间桥
Together the pillars form a space bridge.

984
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,580
这是我设计的  只有我能控制
I designed and I alone can control it.

985
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,580
这打破了你们的物理学定理
It defied your laws of physics

986
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,470
物质一定要通过时间空间传输
to transport matter through time and space.

987
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:11,410
你们说的是瞬间传输  是吗
You're talking about a teleportation device, aren't you?

988
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,370
是的  传输资源和难民
Yes, for resources, for refuges.

989
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,780
难民  或者军队
Refuges or troops of soldiers.

990
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,280
武器  或者炮弹
Weapons, maybe bombs.

991
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,740
一种瞬间袭击的手段
A means of an instant strike,

992
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,140
这就是它的军事功能  对吗
that's its military function, isn't it?

993
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,200
这是我们的科技
It is our technology.

994
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,430
必须要归还给我们
And it must be returned.

995
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,890
是的  如果人类同意的话
Yes, if humans say so.

996
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,840
你不能把大规模杀伤武器
You can't just bring weapons

997
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,980
运到我们的地盘
of mass destruction into our atmosphere.

998
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,670
首先要申报海关
Kind of have to declare customs first.

999
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,150
一种叫做文书工作的小手续
A little formality called paperwork.

1000
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,010
这是我们人类跟动物的区别
Kinda separates us from the animals.

1001
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,400
如果你能扛起我肩上的重担
I will overlook your condescending tone

1002
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,050
我就忽略你这居高临下的语气
if you heave the gravity of mine.

1003
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,640
绝不能让霸天虎知道空间桥在这里
The decepticons must never know the space bridge is here.

1004
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,970
因为要是到了他们手上
For in their hands...

1005
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,310
你们的世界就完蛋了
... it would mean the end of your world.

1006
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,760
这文件做的太差
Totaly nightmare file.

1007
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,250
那就展开调查吧
So the investigation is open.

1008
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,670
我们会派特工去你办公室
We sent agents to your office.

1009
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,830
现在
And for the time being,

1010
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,570
我们会让汽车人护送你回家
we're going to send you home with Autobot protection.

1011
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,390
我需要跟谁说
Wh.. Who do I need to speak to,

1012
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,360
才能让你们明白我可以帮忙
to get you guys to understand I can help.

1013
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,560
我可以帮忙
I can contribute.

1014
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,470
我们都可以帮上忙  告诉我你知道什么
Hey, we can all help. You tell me what you know,

1015
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,740
我可以跟你说说我去过所有有趣的星球
I can tell you all the fun planets I've been.

1016
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,780
请从我桌子上下来
Get off my desk, please.

1017
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,440
你掏枪了  好吧  那我帮不了你
Aw, you pulling out guns. Okay, can't help you on that.

1018
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,700
天哪
Oh, my god.

1019
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,550
你想要我怎么做  立刻回家
What do you envision for me? I go back home now?

1020
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,470
回去上班  继续去复印吗  我是说...
I go back to work? I make copies? I mean...

1021
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,260
这个部门里都是些有经验的
This is a unit for veteran

1022
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,220
情报人员和特种部队
intelligence officers and special forces.

1023
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,550
而不是开过特殊汽车的小男生
Not for boys who once owned special cars.

1024
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,670
这么说有些刻薄吧  夫人
That's a bit harsh, isn't it ma'am?

1025
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,200
不要叫我夫人  我不是夫人
Don't call me ma'am, I'm not a ma'am.

1026
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,660
但你是女的  对吧
But you're a woman, aren't you?

1027
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,460
那么...
Sooo.

1028
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,270
那些是你的吗
Are those yours?

1029
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,740
是的  中情局发的
Yeah, CIA.

1030
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
我这么问只是因为我也有一个
I only ask because I also have a medal.

1031
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,340
总统发的
From the President.

1032
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:40,340
是的
Yeah.

1033
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,680
不错  所以其实没那么复杂对吧
Great, so it's not that complicated, right?

1034
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:45,280
没有我的批准  谁也不许跟汽车人一起工作
No one gets to work with the Autobots unless I approve it.

1035
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,970
你是在破坏我的指挥系统
You're breaking my chain of command.

1036
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:49,940
来吧  走吧
Come on, let's go.

1037
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,950
你已经尽力了
You've done what you can for them.

1038
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,440
请恕我直言  年轻人
With all due respect, young man.

1039
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,750
我很欣赏你的所作所为
I appreciate what you did.

1040
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,890
但是你不是战士
But you're not a soldier.

1041
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,080
你是个送信的  你一直就是个送信的
You're a messenger, you've always been a messenger.

1042
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,320
他是个英雄
He's a hero.

1043
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,810
大黄蜂  你坐货物升降机  我们一会儿上面见
Bee, you take the freight elevator, I'll see you up there.

1044
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,900
要开战了
Ah, this blows.

1045
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,240
-那个女士把我们踢出局了  -是啊
- That lady officially kicked us out. - Yeah.

1046
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,490
保护证人计划逊毙了
Witness protection program sucks.

1047
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,640
是啊  但有大黄蜂和他的大炮
Yeah, but we're a whole

1048
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,720
我们安全多了
lot safer with big yellow and his cannons.

1049
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,510
那只狗什么都保护不了
That dog can't protect crap.

1050
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,060
大黄蜂
Bee.

1051
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,060
你睡不着
You couldn't sleep.

1052
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,380
是啊  我也是
Yeah, me too.

1053
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,770
我真不敢相信她管我叫送信的
I don't believe she called me a messenger.

1054
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,460
你能相信吗  我做了这么多  却只是个送信的
Do you believe that? After everything I've done, I'm a messenger.

1055
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,220
我相信  跟你说  塞米  我们的感觉和你一样
Oh, I believe it. I tell ya, Sammy, we feel the same way.

1056
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,360
地球上的人太无礼了
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

1057
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,640
我们得做点什么
We should do something about it.

1058
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,100
大黄蜂
Bee.

1059
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,020
我想知道他们为什么要杀害人类
I need to know why they're killing humans.

1060
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,880
不如我们给专家打个电话
What say we call in the expert?

1061
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:04,530
我下一位客人曾是美国情报人员
My next guest, is a former American intelligence operative

1062
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,220
他曾勇敢说出
who has dared to speak out

1063
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,420
我们的外星盟军实情
regarding our alleged military alliance,

1064
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,980
而很多人称
... with what many describe

1065
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:13,470
他们是外星球的雇佣兵
as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries.

1066
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,860
他是畅销书《代号英雄》的作者
He is the author of the best selling book, "Code-Name Hero".

1067
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,160
有请我们的特工  西摩・西蒙斯 
For our special agent, Seymour Simmons.

1068
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,550
比尔  我是你的粉丝  我很高兴来到这里
Bill, big fan. Great to be here.

1069
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,780
西蒙斯特工
Now, agent Simmons.

1070
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,550
你希望我们相信这是我们
You would have us believe that it is in our best centuries

1071
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,240
在外星内战中选择阵营的最好时机
to formally take sides in this so called alien civil war?

1072
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,060
另一方想把我们砍了做早餐  所以
Well, the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast, so.

1073
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,250
我不认为我们还有别的选择
I wouldn't exactly want to call it a toss up.

1074
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,170
那些霸天虎们是很危险的
These decepticons are lethal.

1075
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,800
但是民意调查显示有一半的人类
But polls show half the world

1076
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,980
觉得所有的汽车人离开  地球才会安全
would feel safer with the Autobots completely gone.

1077
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,160
把他们弄走
Get them out of here.

1078
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,800
我们不需要他们
We don't need them here.

1079
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,900
那睡觉的时候要拿个手榴弹才安全了
I feel safer when I sleep with a hand grenade.

1080
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,280
我说的不一定对
It doesn't mean I'm always right.

1081
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,020
谢谢  事实上  我们手里有文件显示你
Thank you. Here's a fact, we obtained documents that show you were

1082
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,310
-已经被情报委员会开除了  -查克  我在做采访呢
- fired by the intelligence committee. - Chuck, I'm doing the interview.

1083
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,770
是为了缩小规模  比尔  预算削减
Down sized. Bill, budget cuts.

1084
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,750
-查克  闪一边去  -文件称你有严重妄想症的倾向
- Chuck, out. - ... report get severe delusional tendencies.

1085
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,840
这是新闻陷阱
This is ambush journalism.

1086
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,620
你想知道外星盟军的真相吗
You want the truth about the alien alliance?

1087
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,810
来买我的书吧
Buy my book.

1088
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,330
来买我的书吧
Buy my book!

1089
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,880
趁现在还来得及  各位 
Before it's to late, people.

1090
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,890
你想惹恼我吗  比尔  脱光打一架
You want to piss me, Bill, you want get naked?

1091
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,510
我随时奉陪  采访结束
I'm ready, interview is over.

1092

我给你一个忠告吧
And I got a suggestion for you.

1094
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:16,450
采访结束了  明白吗
It is over, understand?

1095
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,230
损害防控
Damage control.

1096
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,560
-管家  -很明显你弄得西蒙斯先生很心烦
- Dutch! - You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons.

1097
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,810
给你23秒离开这间屋子
You have 23 seconds to leave the property.

1098
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,320
我已经叫警察了
I have called the police.

1099
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,970
你们是群不自量力的农民
You are peasant people throwing rocks at a giant.

1100
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,300
接下来是什么  还有什么 
What's up next, what have we got?

1101
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,740
中午在市中心的新书签售会
Book signing midtown at noon,

1102
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,990
然后是探索频道的真人秀节目

1103
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,610
对了  还有这个
Oh, and I had this, um... um.

1104
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,950
威特维奇  今天给我打了五个电话
The Witwicky who keeps calling me five times today.

1105
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,370
那个孩子  他想做什么
The kid, what does he want?

1106
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,150
我打电话是因为霸天虎回来了
I called because the decepticons

1107
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,800
我想知道原因  我需要你的帮助

1108
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,930
他们回来了
They're back?

1109
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,390
那样的话  又能赚钱了
Well, that's good for business.

1110
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,710
要是我告诉你我知道一个50年前
What if I told you I know a 50

1111
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,710
外星秘密而没人告诉过你  怎么样
year old alien secret that nobody ever told you?

1112
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,000
别诱惑我
Do not tempt my addiction.

1113
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,280
我已经金盆洗手了  孩子
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

1114
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,540
管家  这条线路安全吗
Dutch, is this line secure?

1115
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,380
不安全
No.

1116
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:56,970
加密

1117
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,570
别冒险
Don't take the risk.

1118
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,080
我很有钱  为什么不冒险
I'm rich, why should I?

1119
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,140
别犯老毛病  我不会的
Do not relapse, I won't.

1120
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,890
别让魔鬼们取得胜利
Do not let the demons win.

1121
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,160
线路安全

1122
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:06,890
好了
Got.

1123
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,860
什么样的秘密
What kind of.... secret?

1124
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,100
阿波罗号  月球  外星人  隐藏的
Apollo, moon, aliens, cover-up...

1125
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,630
未来科技  暗杀  一类的东西
... future tech, assassinations, that kind of stuff.

1126
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,460
阿波罗号
Oh, Apollo.

1127
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,790
管家
Dutch!

1128
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:31,160
告诉威震天  跟哥跳个舞吧
Tell Megatron, let's tango.

1129
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,950
这个星球如此宏伟  如此宁静
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

1130
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,260
一点都不像赛博坦的末日岁月
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

1131
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,760
我很想知道它本来会是什么样子
I've wondered what might have been.

1132
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,660
如果是你指挥了最后的战斗
If you had fought the final battle.

1133
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:55,260
而不是我
Instead of me.

1134
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,090
永远不要为过去悲伤  年轻的战士
Never morn the past, young warrior.

1135
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,180
正是因为你  我们的种族才得以存续
Thanks to you, our race survives.

1136
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,540
你才是我们的首领  御天敌
You were our leader, Sentinel.

1137
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,920
再次领导我们是你的权利
It is your right to lead us again.

1138
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,680
在一个我不了解的世界
In a world I do not know.

1139
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,450
我不再是你的老师了  擎天柱
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.

1140
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,440
现在你是我的老师
You are mine.

1141
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,490
我们必须查清楚这件事
We've got to break this case down.

1142
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,810
这些宇航员的死亡迅速蔓延
What we have here is an astronaut epidemic.

1143
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,810
战争中失踪的  去世了的  交通事故的
M.I.A., dead, died in a car accident,

1144
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,440
被谋杀的  送医时死亡的  车祸死的
killed, D.O.A., car death.

1145
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,510
就像是这些家伙不会开车
It's like these guys can't drive.

1146
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,640
他们可以飞去外太空
They can fly into outer space.

1147
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,000
但是他们却不会开汽车
But they can't drive a car.

1148
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,620
你的资料拿到了  威特维奇
Procured your information, Witwicky.

1149
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,710
谢谢你  布鲁斯
Thank you, Bruce.

1150
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,630
别关门
Noo.

1151
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,870
你得让我见识一下  就一下
You let me see one of them, one time.

1152
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,480
-快点  -很快的
- Quick. - Very.

1153
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,940
这是勘测命令
Here's their reconnaissance order.

1154
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,370
上面说航天航空局2009年启动
It say's NASA launched in 2009.

1155
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,270
看  记录显示王可能弄乱了代码
See, forensics show Wang may have messed with the code

1156
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,950
以阻止他们对月球的远端进行绘图
preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon

1157
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,350
也就是阴影一面
which is also the dark side.

1158
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,840
真特么了不起
Freaking awesome.

1159
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,900
他们跟我们交易  恐吓我们
They pay for trade us, intimidate us.

1160
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,510
强迫我们干些不法勾当
... coerce us to do their dirty work.

1161
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,790
一旦他们完成了
And once they're done?

1162
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,300
咔嚓
Dushhhh.

1163
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,570
就杀人灭口
The double tap cerebellum.

1164
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,310
所以这些人当时是在替霸天虎效力
So he was working for the Decepticons.

1165
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,270
我觉得这跟霸天虎
I don't think this is about the Decepticons.

1166
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,230
在找月球上的什么东西没关系
looking for something on the moon.

1167
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,090
我想是他们是想隐藏什么
I think it's about something they wanted to hide.

1168
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,790
跟老爸过两招
Come to daddy.

1169
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,540
来吧  认输吧
Come on, fall down.

1170
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,560
你小时候生病吃错药了吧
Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?

1171
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,070
真是个怪胎
The freak.

1172
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,790
喜欢吗
Hah, like it.

1173
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,630
我来教你
I'll teach you...

1174
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,870
先生
Sir.

1175
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,250
这里正在举行一个高层的外星情报会议
Having a pretty high level alien Intel confab here.

1176
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:46,890
你还不够资格出现在这里吧
That I don't think you're cleared for.

1177
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,870
-跑腿的  -是的  你是对的
- Errand boy. - Yeah, you're right.

1178
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,660
-这机器人真给力  -布鲁斯  你该走了
- It's a bitchin' robot. - I think it's time to go, Bruce, okay?

1179
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,840
谢谢你让我进来
Thank you so much for this.

1180
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,110
还是快走吧  布鲁斯
Better go, Bruce.

1181
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,570
我都要冒烟了
Hey, I'm smokin' over here.

1182
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,680
还有失踪的俄罗斯宇航员
Now with the missing Russian cosmonauts.

1183
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,750
苏联取消过一次载人登月任务
Turns out the soviets cancelled a manned mission to the moon.

1184
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,480
是在1972年
The moon, in 1972

1185
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,870
当时有2名苏联宇航员隐匿在美国
when 2 of cosmonauts went into hiding in America.

1186
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,830
我刚找到他们了
And I just found them, aaaah.

1187
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,190
你真是个天才  里恩
You're a genius, Brains.

1188
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,130
这招真行  大黄蜂
Oh, that was smooth, Bumble Bee.

1189
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,870
差了一大截
Missed it by that much.

1190
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,510
你好
Hi.

1191
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,220
有人告诉我怎么了吗
Would somebody tell me what the hell's going on?

1192
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,230
你是谁
Who are you?

1193
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,170
-你是谁  -我是谁
- Who are you? - Who am I?

1194
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,350
那是谁  管家  搜她身
Who is that? Dutch, frisk her.

1195
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,460
-当然  -不要
- Certainly. - Here, no.

1196
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:37,720
管家
Dutch, um...

1197
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,690
别碰我
Don't touch me.

1198
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,750
-我不会...  -山姆
- I'm not going to... - Sam?

1199
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,110
天使
Angel.

1200
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,670
我在工作
Uh, I was working.

1201
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,960
对于这一切  我很抱歉
I'm sorry about this.

1202
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,830
很好  我们无家可归了
Great, we're homeless.

1203
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,790
她住这里吗
She lives here?

1204
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,600
你有机会搜她身
You had your chance to frisk her.

1205
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:51,920
我也有女朋友
I have a girl friend.

1206
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,140
是吗  叫什么
Really, what's her name?

1207
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,110
印蒂亚
Innn...dia.

1208
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,620
我们说好要去参加迪兰的聚会  记得吗 
We're suppose to be at Dylan's party, remember?

1209
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,250
没忘  可你也知道  我那些朋友
I do remember, but you know, my friends,

1210
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,780
需要我  现在走不开
...they need me. I have to be here right now.

1211
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,850
还有什么  汽车人以及军方
And what, the Autobots and the

1212
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,730
他们无法独自搞定此事
military they can't handle this on their own.

1213
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,250
知道我喜欢你那些战争故事什么吗  山姆
You know what I liked about your war stories, Sam?

1214
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,630
因为它们只是故事
It's that they were stories.

1215
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:09,710
都是些过去的事情
They were in the past.

1216
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,150
听着  我知道你想起了你哥哥
Look, I know you're thinking about your brother.

1217
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,800
还有你的家人
Okay, and you're thinking about your family.

1218
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,160
但这次情况不一样
And it's not that situation.

1219
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,070
-不一样吗  -不一样
- No? - No.

1220
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,040
怎么不一样
Why not?

1221
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:17,520
怎么就不一样呢  山姆
Why isn't it, Sam?

1222
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:20,730
你觉得我们是想让我哥哥活着  还是想要奖章
You think we'd rather has his medals, or we'd rather have him?

1223
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,880
我知道  我明白
I hear you, I get it.

1224
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,850
你拿我的兔子去哪儿  站住
Where are you taking my bunny, stop.

1225
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,460
就等一下
Just stop for a second.

1226
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,010
你以为昨晚上我睡着了吗
You think I could sleep last night?

1227
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,450
我终于明白  山姆想大冒险
I mean it hit me. No, Sam want's the big danger.

1228
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:32,600
没有冒险就活不下去
He doesn't know who he is without it.

1229
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,660
我只想有人需要我

1230
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,320
我需要你
You matter to me.

1231
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,490
我知道你是担心我  我知道
I know you're worried, I know you're worried.

1232
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,670
但我向你保证  我可以搞定
But I promise you I can, I can handle this.

1233
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,810
能行吗  你能保证吗
Can you, you can promise it?

1234
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,010
我保证
I promise.

1235
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,690
山姆  我不想失去你  我知道这件事情的后果
Sam, I don't want to loose you, and I know where this leads.

1236
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,900
我还没准备好
I'm not ready for this.

1237
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,320
你和我一起吗
Are you coming with me?

1238
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,840
我办不到
I can't.

1239
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,770
好吧
Okay.

1240
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,620
给你的脚
Here's your foot.

1241
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,780
真正的勇士得直面路途上的孤独
A warrior's path is a solitary one.

1242
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,390
她怎么买得起这样的车

1243
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,110
-她老板送的  -有钱的混蛋
- Her boss. - Rich bastards.

1244
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,330
我以前恨死这些家伙了
I used to hate them.

1245
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,590
但现在...
But now it's...

1246
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,710
结队去追捕两名俄罗斯宇航员
Going to a gang on a hunt for two Russian Cosmonauts.

1247
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,160
没有什么比开着迈巴赫更爽的了  是吧
Nothing like driving in a Maybach, huh?

1248
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,400
告诉你  只有德国人真正懂车
Germans know how to make cars, let me tell ya.

1249
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,910
我这个管家  前国家安全局成员

1251
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,780
一路跟踪他们至此
Tracked them down, here.

1252
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,250
这么说这些宇航员想藏起来  为什么呢
So these cosmonauts wanted to hide. Why?

1253
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,630
我看到一个目标
Bingo, I got a match.

1254
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,160
你简直是只德国牧羊犬  管家
You're a German Shepard, Dutch.

1255
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,550
俄罗斯人
The thing about Russians is...

1256
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,030
都不喜言谈
...they never like to talk.

1257
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,330
得用点全球通用语言
It's going to take a little of the international language.

1258
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,840
-Dos vedanya  -这是再见的意思
- Dos vedanya. - That means goodbye.

1259
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,090
谁来引领革命
Who's to get revolution.

1260
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,850
一个名人  不知道叫什么

1261

管家

1264
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,370
管家  你真没用
Dutch, you suck.

1265
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,280
这是斯拉夫字母
It's a Cyrillic, alphabet.

1266
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,450
就像些计算器上你从用不到的案件
It's like all the buttons you never push on a calculator.

1267
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,610
不是我没用
I don't suck.

1268
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,310
西摩・西蒙斯特工  外星交流部门的  已经退役了
Agent Seymour Simmons, CETI. Formerly Seta.

1269
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,550

1270
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,990
宇航员
Cosmonaut chicks.

1271
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:01,220
那又怎样
So what?

1272
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,860
你本应航行到月球的阴影  然而
You were suppose to travel to the Dark side of the moon, then....

1273
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,020
忽然一切都取消了
It all got shut down.

1274
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,310
问题是
The question is.

1275
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:11,890
为什么
Why?

1276
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,490
我的孩子可以在这吸烟吗
Can my child smoke in here?

1277
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,120
好吧  没事  好吧

-开枪啊  -这个菜鸟是谁
- Yeah, shoot me. - Who was this delish, huh?

1279

我就是个司机  你呢

1280
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,680
你真漂亮
You are beautiful.

1281
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,040
没人说你很漂亮吗
Has anyone told you, you're beautiful?

1282
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,460
因为她就是个美人
'Cause she's a beautiful woman.

1283
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,430
管家  回笼子里

抱歉  这是老毛病

1287
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,080
好了  大家都冷静下来
Okay, let's everybody just calm down.

1288
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,600
让我们降降温  把枪放下  放松点
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns. Just relax.

1289
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,060
第二次世界大战结束了
World War 2 is over.

1290
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,930
你将看到的是前苏联最高机密之一
You're about to see one of the biggest soviet secrets.

1291
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,350
是美国人首次将人类送上月球
America first to send men to the moon.

1292
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,860
但首次将摄像机送上去的是前苏联
But U.S.S.R. First to send camera.

1293
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,560
1959年  我们的月球三号
In 1959 our Lunar 3.

1294
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,070
拍下了月球阴影  背光的那一侧
take picture of the Dark, the shadow side.

1295
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:33,730
什么都没看到
See's nothing.

1296
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:39,980
-可是在1963年  月球四号看到  -奇怪的岩石
- But in 1963 Lunar 4 sees.. - ... strange rocks.

1297
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,830

有一些拖痕
With some, drag marks.

1301
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,530
我看过  这些不是岩石
I've seen these, these aren't rocks.

1302
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,670
这些是传送柱
These are pillars.

1303
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,770
外星人用来搭建太空桥的传送柱
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1304
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,340
因为汽车人也有五个  所以我们知道
We know about them because the Autobots have five of these.

1305
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,780
霸天虎们肯定在阿波罗11到达之前
The decepticons must have

1306
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,690
袭击了飞船
raided the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there.

1307
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:07,120
拿走传送柱藏了起来
Took the pillars and hid them.

1308
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,360
这个说不通  霸天虎攻击了飞船
Well that doesn't make sense. The Decepticons have the ship.

1309
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,310
所有能量柱都归他们了  
They have all those pillars.

1310
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:11,620
如果说只有御天敌才能使用
Why would they leave several...

1311
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,260
为什么还留下好几个呢
... of these if he's the only one that can use them?

1312
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,740
除非
Unless...

1313
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,130
他们仍然需要他
He's the one thing they still need.

1314
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,400
我们得和御天敌会面
We got to meet up with Sentinel.

1315
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:21,040
跟他会合  并保证他的安全
Rendezvous with him, and keep him safe.

1316
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,790
米樱  我刚带上御天敌  擎天柱十分钟后到
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel, Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1317
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,060
我们正在全速赶过去
We're coming in fast, now.

1318
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:29,090
威特维奇先生  我想我已经讲清楚了
Mr. Witwicky I thought I made it clear to you,

1319
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,680
不要打这个电话
that I did not want you calling this phone.

1320
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,270
听着  整件事情从一开始就是个阴谋
Listen, the whole thing has been a set up since the beginning.

1321
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,570
霸天虎想利用擎天柱找到御天敌
Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel,

1322
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,510
因为只有擎天柱才能让他复活
because only Optimus could revive him.

1323
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,220
可是我们掌握着太空桥
But we have the space bridge.

1324
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,980
米樱  你只不过有五个传送柱而已
Mearing, you have five pillars.

1325
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,460
我刚刚得知他们有上百个
I just learned that they have hundreds.

1326
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,900
你被利用了
You're doing exactly what they wanted you to do.

1327
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,400
听着
What do I need to say to you.

1328
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,820
霸天虎为御天敌而来
The Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime.

1329
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,320
立刻赶往鸟巢基地

1332
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,490
三辆黑色车位于郊区
Three black suburban.

1333
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:38,570
大黄蜂  你得把御天敌带出去  全速前进
B, you gotta get Sentinel out of here, you got to floor it.

1334
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,010
天啊  我还好
Oh man, oh I'm fine.

1335
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:55,690
小心点  小心点
Watch out, watch out.

1336
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:13,960
逮着了
Gotcha.

1337
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:16,660
开枪  开枪

1338
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,660
快开枪  大黄蜂
Shoot him, B.

1339
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,260
大黄蜂  快跑  再快点  再快点  大黄蜂  跑 
B, you gotta move. Faster, faster B, go!

1340
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,030
完了
Wipeout.

1341
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,210
好了  返回鸟巢基地
Come on, back to NEST.

1342
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,830
意大利人  我来追他
Dino, I got him.

1343
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,040
有问题吗
Is there a problem?

1344
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,000
陷入小小的僵局
Whoa, little Mexican stand-off we got here.

1345
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:06,570
放下武器
Weapons down.

1346
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,010
这样我们会让你们有尊严地逃跑
And we'll let you escape with your dignity.

1347
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,060
放下武器
Drop them.

1348
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,650
很好
That's good.

1349
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,270
铁皮  当心
Ironhide, watch out.

1350
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,980
铁皮  拿着
Ironhide, catch.

1351
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:38,490
小心后面
Behind you.

1352
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:44,330
无耻霸天虎
Decepticon punk.

1353
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,850

1356
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,920
-兰诺克斯  -走  走  走  走

1357
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,250
到处都是霸天虎
We got decepticons everywhere.

1358
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,680
我已经出动全部人马出去找了
I got my whole team deployed looking for them.

1359
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,710

1360
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,010
保护好御天敌  把他锁在里面
Protect Sentinel, get him locked up inside.

1361
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,310
包在我身上
Consider it done.

1362
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,310
你的任务是守护好他  他是整件事情的核心
You gotta guard him, because he's the key to the whole thing.

1363
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,180
确实如此
Indeed I am.

1364
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:19,460
你必须意识到的是  我亲爱的汽车人兄弟
What you must realized, my Autobot brothers.

1365
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,950
我们永远也不可能赢得这场战争
Is we were never going to win the war.

1366
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:24,680
为我们星球的存亡着想
For the sake of our planets survival.

1367
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,890
必须与威震天
A deal had to be made.

1368
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,500
达成某种协议
With Megatron.

1369
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,150
退后
Get back!

1370
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,900
你做了什么
What have you done?

1371
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:43,500
据此  我解除你的职权
I hereby discharge you from duty.

1372
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,290
-大黄蜂  -退后
- B! - Get back.

1373
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,440
把所有鸟巢部队带回基地
Bring all the NEST forces back to the base.

1374
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,530
来吧  快走
Come on, move.

1375
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,020
让他们进来  带进来  我们这里人手不够
Get them in, get them here. We don't have enough men.

1376
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,070
别招惹御天敌
Do not engage Sentinel.

1377
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,210
去后门
Just go to the back gate.

1378
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,500
长官  趴下
Director, down.

1379
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,790
快行动  快行动
Let's slide, let's slide

1380
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:38,830
走  跟上
Go, follow me.

1381
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,780
开火
Start firing.

1382
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,420
-等等  不要  -滚开
- Wait don't. - Get out.

1383
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,270
御天敌
Hey, Sentinel.

1384
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:52,990
怎么了
What is going on?

1385
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,600
你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

1386
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,450
我是御天敌
I am a Prime.

1387
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,020
无须听从你的命令
I do not take orders from you.

1388
01:12:03,790 --> 01:12:05,950
米樱指挥官快走  我们不是他的对手  快走
Director Mearing come on. We can't fight him, let's go.

1389
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,270
-我们得走  -立刻
- We have to go. - Now.

1390
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,870
把属于我的还给我
Return what belongs to me.

1391
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,550
天啊
Oh, my god.

1392
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,240
所有人出去  所有人出去
Everybody out, everybody out.

1393
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,650
大家保持冷静
Everybody stay calm.

1394
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,320
看看  擎天柱
Yeah take a look, Optimus.

1395
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,760
这都是因你而起
This is all on you.

1396
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,260
御天敌攻击了地下室
The Sentinel hit the vault.

1397
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,380
把传送柱带走了
Took the pillars.

1398
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,880
快来  我们走
Come on, let's go.

1399
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,090
这样  通知101伞兵部队
All right, notify the 101st airborne.

1400
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,120
我们得把东西追回来
We need to hunt this thing down.

1401
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,060
卡莉
Carly.

1402
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,460
篝火弄的  热乎乎的
Hot from a little camp fire.

1403
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,610
曲奇饼
Smores.

1404
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,210
不错吧  我们真的生活在世外 
Isn't this great, we are really living off the land.

1405
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,170
爸  妈  有没看到卡莉回来过啊
Ma, Dad. Have you guys seen Carly come home yet?

1406
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,880
不好意思  你能先敲门吗
Excuse me, can you knock please.

1407
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:16,870
这是我们的卧室
This is our bedroom.

1408
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:17,890
她为什么不在家呢
Why wouldn't she be at home?

1409
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:19,280
我们吵架了  而且
We had a fight, and....

1410
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,390
我们可能已经分手了  或者正要分手  
We might have broken up, or be on a break.

1411
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,290
我也搞不清
I don't really know.

1412
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,030
-什么  -听着  我没法谈这个
- What!?.. Noo. - Look, I can't talk about it.

1413
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,320
-你开玩笑吧  -我
- You gotta be kidding me. - I

1414
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,880
现在没功夫跟你谈论细节  妈  我得找到她
can't go into details now, Mom. I have to find her.

1415
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,740
山姆  我们得开个家庭会议
Sam, we're having a family meeting.

1416
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,740
家庭会议
Family meeting.

1417
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,280
你可能还不知道  不过你爸爸和我
You may not know this. But your

1418
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,520
并不是一直以来都这么愉快地相处
father and I were not always this perfectly happy.

1419
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:35,400
你知道在我们的婚姻中我也曾想过
You know there was a time in our marriage when I thought,

1420
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,710
这次过不下去了
"This is not going to work out."

1421
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,120
-你可以快点吗  -我只是希望你
- Can you please hurry up. - I'm just hope you ...

1422
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,580
-能够明白  -她损我呢
- .. just understand that you... - She's damaging me.

1423
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,350
你是和世界顶级的女人分手
...break up with one world class high.

1424
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,060
-不  停  停  够了  -嗯
- No, stop, stop, okay. - Yeah.

1425
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,440
她甩了我  我就找个更好的
She dumped me, I moved to something better.

1426
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,490
没错  我更高兴了
That's it, I'm a happier person.

1427
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:46,500
你想得美
It's not going to be as beautiful...

1428
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,260
-失去她  你为什么失去她了呢  -帮帮我
- Lose her, why did you lose her? - Help me.

1429
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,530
-他们只是吵架了  -是打架了
- They had an argument. - We had a fight.

1430
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,840
好吧  可是你找不到第三个了
Okay, but you're not going to get a third one.

1431
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,660
除非你有个大...
I mean unless you have like a big...

1432
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,370
什么  妈妈
What the, mom!

1433
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:55,530
妈  妈  我不想谈这个了
Mom, mom, don't want to talk about it.

1434
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:56,290
你根本就不了解情况
I mean you just don't know.

1435
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,290
-只是不想谈  -你需要本书
- Just don't want to talk. - You need a book.

1436
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,760
跟她说你永远都是错的
You'll always wrong.

1437
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,870
-习惯就好了  -好的  这就是你要读的
- Get used to it. -Okay, this you gotta read this.

1438
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,450
书名叫她第一次来  里面有些
She comes first, there's some killer...

1439
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:05,030
-确实不错的东西  -别  别  别
- ...shit in here. - No, No, No.

1440
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:06,500
-看看吧  -免谈  免谈
- Ah, let's get this. - No, no.

1441
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,570
-不  不  -坐下  坐下
- No, no. - Sit down. Sit down!

1442
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,810
立刻声援
Back me up.

1443
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,380
有快乐的妻子  就有幸福的生活
Happy wife, happy life.

1444
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,070
-没错  -不快乐的妻子
- Yeah. - unhappy wife

1445
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,460
将会使得你的下半辈子惨不忍睹
Stone cold misery for the rest of your...

1446
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,670
-够了  -这是事实
- Stop. - It's true.

1447
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,860
我只是想说
All I'm saying is.

1448
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,140
你爱这个女孩吗
Do you love this girl?

1449
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,190
她就是我要找的
She's the one.

1450
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,830
那么你就得想法得到她
Then you gotta go get her.

1451
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:25,070
我是说  你爸爸和我闹矛盾的时候
I mean, your dad and I, when we had troubles.

1452
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:27,650
即便天涯海角他也会找到我
He moved heaven and earth to find me.

1453
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,710
不是吗  告诉他你怎么说的
Would he, say what you said.

1454
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:30,670
说啊
Say it.

1455
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:33,080
我会伴你左右  直到天荒地老
I would follow you to the end of time.

1456
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,970
-是不是挺傻冒的  -不
- Does that suck or what? - No.

1457
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,390
爱幻想的坏蛋
Bad syfy dope.

1458
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,840
我要你们尽量躲远点  越远越好
I want you guys to get as far away from here as you can.

1459
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,230
明白吗
You understand?

1460
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,820
我爱你们
I love you.

1461
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,290
哦  主人
Oh, my master.

1462
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,250
您的计划实在高明
Such a brilliant scheme.

1463
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,830
那么  御天敌离开赛博坦的时候
So, when Sentinel left Cybertron,

1464
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,660
就是要叛变
...it was to defect.

1465
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,360
在命运将我们都打败之前
He was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth,

1466
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,890
他本该和我在地球会合
before fate waylaid us both.

1467
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,520
能让他复活的唯一办法
The only way to revive him,

1468
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:22,880
就是擎天柱和矩阵
...we needed Prime and his matrix.

1469
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,170
天衣无缝的策略
Excellent strategy.

1470
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,820
所以他现在是您的伙伴了  主人
So he is now your partner, master.

1471
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,730
拉拢到他是我最大的胜利
He is my greatest triumph.

1472
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:44,980
真是叹为观止
So impressive.

1473
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,380
开始传送
Commencing transport.

1474
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,470
住手  不  不  不  御天敌
Stop! No, no, no Sentinel!

1475
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,660
原谅我
Forgive me.

1476
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,640
我们就在这
Here we are.

1477
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,600
来打吧
Fight us now.

1478
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,800
汽车人  撤退
Autobots, retreat.

1479
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,430
为什么  御天敌  为什么
Why Sentinel, why?

1480
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,850
为了赛博坦
For Cybertron.

1481
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,100
为了我们的家
For our home.

1482
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,020
战争毁掉的东西  我们可以重建
What war destroyed, we can rebuild.

1483
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,050
但要与霸天虎联合才有可能
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1484
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,040
不  不是非这样不可
No, it's not the only way.

1485
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:28,550
这里才是我们的家
This is our home.

1486
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,210
我们必须保护人类
We must defend the humans.

1487
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:32,340
你大错特错  擎天柱
So lost you are, Optimus.

1488
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,250
在赛博坦我们是上帝
On Cybertron we were Gods.

1489
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,680
而这里他们却叫我们机器
And here they call us machines.

1490
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,240
让人类做我们的奴隶
Let the humans serve us.

1491
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,620
或者毁灭
Or perish.

1492
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,260
你该庆幸我没杀你
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

1493
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,260
过不了多久  你就会明白的
In time, you'll see.

1494
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,570
这事没完
It's not over.

1495
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,260
如果我是他
And if I were him,

1496
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,470
我会半刻也不让你脱离我的视线范围
...I wouldn't let you out of my sight for one second.

1497
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,530
真是好笑  一路以来我都在想
It's funny I was just thinking on the way over here,

1498
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,060
也许我该听听迪兰的意见
I really could use some advice from Dylan.

1499
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,900
-你还真在这  可以跟你谈谈吗  -欢迎光临
- And there he is. Can I speak to you? - Welcome.

1500
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,150
请坐  喝点东西吧
Please sit down, have a drink.

1501
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,180
知道吗  我不需要饮料
You know what, I don't need a drink.

1502
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:11,710
或者一辆汽车  或者一份工作
Or a car, or a job.

1503
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,230
我只想单独跟我女朋友谈谈
I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone.

1504
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,880
没什么问题吧  灯泡先生
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

1505
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,820
失陪
Excuse me.

1506
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,830
-怎么回事  -到外面告诉你
- What's going on? - I'll tell you outside.

1507
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,360
我真觉得可以帮到你  山姆
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1508
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,160
我还记得跟父亲的谈到艰难的选择
I remember a talk I had with my dad once, about tough choices.

1509
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,170
现在不是时候  我有些事需要处理
Now's not the time, I'll set something up, though.

1510
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,350
那还要回溯到我爸爸的公司
'Cause that was way back when my dad's firm was in charge

1511
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,810
负责航空航天局的预算审核及报账工作
of budget review and accounting for NASA.

1512
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:37,790
他教会我的事情是
You see the thing that he taught me was...

1513
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,120
战争本身与你无关时
When it's not your war,

1514
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,270
要跟胜利的一方联手
you join the side that's going to win.

1515
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,740
太直接了吗  还是我不讨人喜欢
Too direct, or was it just me?

1516
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,240
显然责任不在您  先生
Certainly not you, sir.

1517
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,580
你是我的
You're mine.

1518
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,610
-帮忙  谁能帮帮忙  -山姆  我出不去
- Get help. Someone get help. - Sam, I can't get out.

1519
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,330
-晚安  -晚安  迪兰先生
- Goodnight - Goodnight Mr. Dylan.

1520
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,810
山姆  救我出去
Sam, get me out of here.

1521
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:17,860
救命
Help.

1522
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,060
救命
Get help.

1523
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,030
他还年轻  会懂事的
He's young, he will learn.

1524
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,640
-让我出去  -晚安
- Get me out. - Goodnight.

1525
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,880
今晚很愉快
This was a fun night.

1526
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,330
你真以为自己是第一个
You really think you're the

1527
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:28,390
被要求介入一场宏大的外星人事件中吗
first man ever asked to join a noble alien cause?

1528
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:29,380
你是谁
Who are you?

1529
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,640
知道为什么自1972年后
You know why we've not

1530
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,890
我们没再重返月球吗
been back to the moon since 1972?

1531
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,030
因为这两个家伙
Because these two.

1532
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:35,790
他们来找我爸
They came to my dad and

1533
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:37,930
让他在账目中做些手脚
they told him to do some creative accounting.

1534
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,760
使得返回月球花费太高
Make it way to expensive to ever go back.

1535
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,250
所以他和其他人
So he and others, shut

1536
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,020
终止了美俄两国的太空计划
down the American and Russian space programs.

1537
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,470
而且自那以后他们就是我们的客户了
And they've been our clients ever since.

1538
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:46,690
你还帮忙杀人吗
You helped to kill people?

1539
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,110
有得选吗
You think they give you a choice?

1540
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,810
此外  我也不是直接参与其中
Besides, it's not like I personally participated.

1541
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:50,810
我是个联络员
I am a liaison.

1542
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,160
负责联络
I liaise.

1543
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,070
这样浪费时间就太没诚意了  山姆
It's hostile take over time, Sam.

1544
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,700
山姆
Sam!

1545
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,320
让她走
Let her go.

1546
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,000
山姆
Sam.

1547
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,070
我监视你好多年了  山姆
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.

1548
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,480
再也找不到比你更好的
You're the one spy I've never been

1549
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,750
能够安排在汽车人身边的间谍了
able to provide as the one close to the Autobots.

1550
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,270
山姆  别听他的
Sam, don't do what he wants.

1551
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,500
不  他会的
Yes he will.

1552
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,090
像他们一样
They all do.

1553
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,720
放聪明点  懂吗
You should be smarter. You understand me.

1554
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,300
你眨眼的功夫
The time it takes you to blink,

1555
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,140
他们就会干掉她  也会干掉我
they will do it to her, and they will do it to me.

1556
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,130
所以当别人给你工作时
So you show a little respect.

1557
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,180
得有起码的尊重
When someone offers you a job.

1558
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,810
手腕
Wrist.

1559
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,510
你要去跟踪擎天柱
You are to track down, Optimus Prime.

1560
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,230
人类之中他只信任你
Because you're the one human he trusts.

1561
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,870
你去问他
You will ask one question.

1562
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,550
他打算如何反击
How does he intend to fight back?

1563
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,860
策略  战术  所有的东西
Strategies, tactics, everything.

1564
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,100
像被咬了一口  是吧
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it.

1565
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,520
高科技产品
It's very high tech.

1566
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,040
通过它  我们可以知道
It lets us see

1567
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,760
你看到了什么  听到了什么
what you see, hear what you hear.

1568
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,290
而且它可以入侵你的神经系统
And it attacks your nervous system.

1569
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,940
所以别玩花招
So if you so much as try and signal.

1570
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,600
我知道要告诉你什么了  山姆
I know what to tell you, Sam.

1571
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,140
关系产生结果
Relationships have consequences.

1572
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,630
我在这里是因为我父亲  
I am here because my father,

1573
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,310
她在这里则是因为你
she is here because of you.

1574
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,380
别  别  别  别
Stop! Stop, stop...stop.

1575
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,160
震荡波  暂且别动她
Soundwave, if you please.

1576
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,120
山姆
Sam.

1577
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:26,530
完成你的任务
Do your job.

1578
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:28,710
她就没事  我向你保证
She'll be safe. I give you my word.

1579
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,730
我会宰了你
I'll kill you.

1580
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,410
给我记住
You have my word.

1581
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,530
全体战斗员进入一级备战
Combatant commands are now at Defcon 1.

大约有两百个霸天虎藏在暗处
Approximately 200 Decepticons are in hiding.

1583

1584
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:47,630
能量检测设备都被触发

1585
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:50,440
联合国刚刚收到一份加密音频文件

01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,080
但我们现在什么处境呢
And where are we now?

1634
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,550
面对着敌人的入侵
Facing an enemy invasion.

1635
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,670
面对着贪得无厌的敌人
With an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more.

1636
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,580
你还知道什么吗
If there's more you know?

1637
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,090
任何关于敌人意图的消息
Anything at all about the enemies intentions.

1638
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,820
现在要告诉我们了
Now's the time to tell.

1639
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,960
汽车人没法离开这个星球
Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.

1640
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:55,850
这一点你就错了
That is where you're wrong.

1641
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:59,150
它名叫苍耳
Its name is the Xanthium.

1642
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,060
带来了第二批汽车人
It bought the second wave of Autobots.

1643
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,650
从那以后它一直由航空航天局看管和研究
And it's been under NASA's care and study ever since.

1644
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,140
我们把它与一部退役的航天飞机相连
We've linked it with a decommissioned shuttle,

1645
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:08,880
维持军管直至离开
to maintain military control until they're gone.

1646
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:10,910
那破烂需要一万磅的扭矩
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque

1647
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:13,320
我这边不需要
on this cheaper Cheep... Oh, not my thing.

1648
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,730
你造成的破坏拖了大伙儿的时间
You damage this delays all me mates.

1649
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:17,560
那几个就是营救车
That's your wreckers.

1650
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,210
他们看管苍耳
They take care of the Xanthium.

1651
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,500
我们不太让他们离开基地  
We don't let them off the base much,

1652
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,440
因为他们是一群混球
because they're assholes.

1653
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,500
你应该拉那头  你这娘娘腔的贱人
You gotta pull that you Nancy wanker.

1654
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,400
这么用力会弄坏的
It's torqued to kill them.

1655
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,330
冷静
Calm down.

1656
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:32,410
-爱普斯  -你丫真蠢
- Epps. - You are ridiculous, that's you.

1657
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,380
你好  伙计
Hello, man.

1658
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:36,740
-你怎么在这  -我从空军退役了
-What are you doing here -I'm retired from the air force.

1659
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,190
能放手吗
Can you let my hand go?

1660
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,160
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

1661
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,840
现在我只是给他们当顾问做后勤
I went on to just consult and run interference for them.

1662
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,590
没有战斗
No more combat

1663
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:47,030
没有外星人在背后攻击我
or alien shooting at my ass.

1664
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,280
我得到了一份梦想职业
I got a dream job.

1665
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,700
要把汽车人赶走
Kicking the Autobots out.

1666
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,740
你相信这是真的吗
Do you believe this is happening?

1667
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,640
你认为要把他们送到哪
Where do you think is taking them?

1668
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:57,150
除了地球  随便哪 
Any planet but here.

1669
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:02,760
我要找这里的负责人
I want to talk to whoever's in charge here.

1670
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,700
夏洛特・米樱
Charlotte Mearing.

1671
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:08,880
西蒙斯特工
Agent Simmons

1672
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,830
前西蒙斯特工
Former Agent Simmons, so.

1673
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,660
我看到你在华盛顿幸免于难
I see you survived Washington.

1674
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,540
华盛顿  埃及  被人伤透心 
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak.

1675
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,100
我都没死  我以后也不会死
I survived, I will survive.

1676
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,000
他们把所有人都卷进来了  孩子
They're bringing everybody in, kid.

1677
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,050
把所有机器摆在桌子上
Putting all the Intel on the table.

1678
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,240
如果你认为把九个汽车人送走
And if you think that putting 9 Autobots,

1679
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,430
就能解决这破事
is going to solve a damn thing...

1680
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,520
这我管不了
It's out of my hands.

1681
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,450
平步青云  是吗
Moving up in the world, huh?

1682
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,880
你那活真不错
Your booty looks excellent.

1683
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:39,340
如果你告诉任何人
You ever say word to anyone

1684
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,030
那晚在匡提科发生的事情
about what happened that night in Quantico.

1685
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:42,910
我就把你的心挖出来
I'll cut your heart out.

1686
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,650
我的心已经被你挖了
You already did.

1687
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,670
塞米  听我说
Sammy, listen to me.

1688
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,770
别让让他们驱逐我们  
Don't let them exile us.

1689
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:50,060
别让他们带走我们  山姆
Don't let them take us, Sam.

1690
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,690
这是霸天虎的圈套
It's a Decepticon trap.

1691
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:31,100
检查氮气  我们要从这里起飞
Checked the nitrogen, we're booting out of here.

1692
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:34,930
擎天柱
Optimus.

1693
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,250
你们首领说得对
What your leaders say is true.

1694
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,900
都是我的错
This was all my fault.

1695
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,210
我告诉他们要相信谁
I told them whom to trust.

1696
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,260
我大错特错
I was so wrong.

1697
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:45,480
这不是你的责任
It doesn't make your fault,

1698
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,030
而是让你变得更加像人类
it makes you human for a change.

1699
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,630
记住
Remember this.

1700
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,840
你们可以对我们失去信心
You may loose your faith in us.

1701
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:55,270
但千万别对自己失去信心
But never in yourselves.

1702
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,210
我想知道你们怎样反击
I need to know how you're going to fight back.

1703
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,160
我知道肯定有什么策略
I know there's a strategy.

1704
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,590
我知道你们会带着援军回来
I know you're coming back with reinforcements.

1705
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,020
我知道你们有计划的
Something, I know there's a plan.

1706
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,360
你可以告诉我  不会有其他人知道
You can tell me, no other human will ever know.

1707
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,480
没计划
There is no plan.

1708
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,320
我们只是按他们的要求去做
We just do what they want,

1709
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,650
我们自己怎么活下去
how are we going to live with ourselves?

1710
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:28,590
你是我的朋友  山姆
You are my friend, Sam.

1711
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:31,100
永远都是
You always will be.

1712
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:34,040
但你们首领已经说了
But your leaders have spoken.

1713
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:36,770
从今以后
From here.

1714
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,640
你们只能独自战斗
The fight will be your own.

1715
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,040
长话短说
Make it short.

1716
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,790
我们要起飞了
We're loading up.

1717
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:00,570
好了  快点
All right, hustle up!

1718
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,500
当力所能及时
When we do whatever we can.

1719
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,400
就做得漂亮点
make it like it was.

1720
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,900
你永远是我的朋友
You will always be, my friend.

1721
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,300
山姆
Sam.

1722
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,900
我要走了
I gotta be going on.

1723
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,600
多年以后  他们会问我们
Years from now, they're gonna ask us.

1724
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:35,340
他们占领这星球的时候  你们在哪里
Where were you when they took over the planet?

1725
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,740
我们回答说
We're gonna say.

1726
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,440
我们只是袖手旁观
We just stood by and watched.

1727
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:58,640
你应该把这看做合作
You should really look at this as a partnership.

1728
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,730
如果你想被载入史册
You have to stand on the side of progress

1729
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,040
就应该顺应潮流
if you want to be a part of history.

1730
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,640
准备发射  五  四  三  二
Go launch in..5...4...3..2

1731
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,040
一  零
1...zero.

1732
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,960
我要说的就是  你得逞了  
The word is, you got it.

1733
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,830
我总是心想事成的  山姆
I always get what I want, Sam.

1734
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:57,240
我们还要确认一下
We just needed to be sure.

1735
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,440
确认什么
Sure of what?

1736
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,140
他们不战而退
That they would go without a fight.

1737
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:13,640
-再说一遍  -探测到外来物体
- Say again? - Detecting a foreign object.

1738
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:07,170
我们现在全为霸天虎做事了
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1739
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:11,310
芝加哥  伊利诺斯

1740
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:13,440
我要你帮我追踪一个电话
I need your help to track a phone call.

1741
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,340
电话那边是个难得  他是人类行动的头目
It's a man on this phone, he's the head of the human operation.

1742
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,540
他挟持了卡莉做人质
And he's holding Carly hostage.

1743
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,240
坐好  别动
Sit down, don't move.

1744
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,970
我正看着他开过来
I'm watching him drive up right now.

1745
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:29,630
已经锁定电话线路
The call was placed in-route.

1746
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:32,130
我现在入侵电话的摄像头
I'm hacking into the phone's camera right now.

1747
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,630
好了  从摄像头传回来的实时数据
There that is, that's a live stream from the camera.

1748
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:36,900
什么地方  等等  我用三角定位
Someplace, hold on I can triangulate this.

1749
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:39,890
好了  是芝加哥的基站
Okay, it's Chicago cell site.

1750
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,090
那里  找到了  
There, I got it.

1751
01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:43,290
川普大厦  芝加哥  稍矮的顶层公寓
Trump tower, Chicago, lower penthouse.

1752
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:44,490
我们行动
We're on.

1753
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:48,290
-我要去  -真的吗
- I'm going. - You're sure.

1754
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:49,590
她在那里孤立无援
She is out there without any help

1755
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:51,640
我十五个小时就能到那儿
I can be there in 15 hours.

1756
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,350
你不会一个人去
You're not going alone.

1757
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:58,690
那边还有我一些鸟巢部队的朋友
Still got my NEST friends out there.

1758
01:31:58,690 --> 01:31:59,940
我们召集他们 
We'll round them up,

1759
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:02,250
去救出你的女朋友  再抓到那坏蛋
find your girlfriend and bring this guy in.

1760
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,550
为什么你要帮我
Why are you helping me?

1761
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,150
因为那混蛋也杀了我的朋友
'Cause that asshole killed my friends, too.

1762
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,650
他们说来这里是要我们的资源
They said they were here for our resources.

1763
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,050
去重建他们的星球
To rebuild their planet.

1764
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,650
是的  确切的说是一种特别的资源
Yes, really one resource in particular.

1765
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:31,950
地球特有的
One unique to our planet.

1766
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,350
我们
Us.

1767
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:39,150
你真聪明
You're very smart.

1768
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,750
没有奴隶的劳动力  他们无法重建
You see they can't rebuild without a slave labor force.

1769
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,850
要发射多少火箭才能运送六十亿劳动力
How many rocks up there in the universe offer 6 billion workers?

1770
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,150
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1771
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,150
我们不能运人
We can't transport people.

1772
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,360
他们不是运人
They're not shipping people.

1773
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,780
他们把他们的星球运到这里
They're shipping their planet here.

1774
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:58,750
我的天
Oh, my God.

1775
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:01,380
御天敌在这里做什么
What's Sentinel doing here?

1776
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,860
看
Watch.

1777
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:05,260
他们正在地球散布几百根传送柱
They're spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now.

1778
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,860
几小时之后
In just a few hours.

1779
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:08,460
把它们载入到轨道
They're going to launch them into orbit.

1780
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:11,160
把赛博坦运到我们的大气层
And bring cybertron into our atmosphere.

1781
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,060
红色的那根控制其他的传送柱
The red one there, controls the rest.

1782
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,360
只要触发它  就会启动整个过程
He triggers that, it starts the whole thing.

1783
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:20,360
蝼蚁工人滚吧  没你的事儿了
Be gone insect operative, your work is done.

1784
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,710
是  阁下
Your Excellency.

1785
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:22,860
你真不要脸
You're such a dick.

1786
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,450
你希望这些发生吗
You want this to happen?

1787
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:30,060
我想活  我还想多活四十年
I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1788
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,460
你认为我自找的吗
You think I asked for this?

1789
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,960
我继承了个客户而已
I inherited a client.

1790
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,460
是啊  当赛博坦运过来  我们都成了奴隶
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here and we're all their slaves

1791
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,660
估计他们还是需要一位傀儡领袖
I guess they'll still need a human leader.

1792
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,960
说白了  你要想活命就得听我的
Get this straight, you want to survive you listen to me.

1793
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:58,750
是时候让地球奴隶们
It is time for the slaves of earth

1794
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,860
认识一下他们的主人了
to recognize their masters.

1795
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,660
封锁城市
Seal off the city.

1796
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,260
把狗带走  带到后面来
Get the dogs out of here now, get them in the back.

1797
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,860
我才他们没告诉你这部分  是吧
I guess they didn't tell you about this part, did they.

1798
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,260
你觉得我都知情吗
You think I'm at every meeting?

1799
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:08,160
他们承诺我的安全
They promised I'm safe.

1800
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,260
他们说过我会没事
They said I'm safe.

1801
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:24,260
出发
Let's roll.

1802
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,160
这里没有信号
Don't have a signal reading.

1803
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,560
手机没用了
It's not working.

1804
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,060
撤退
Move back.

1805
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,120
芝加哥被外星人飞船包围了
There's a ring of alien ships around Chicago.

1806
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,800
我们的远程炸弹在空中被击落
Our high range bombers were just knocked out of the sky.

1807
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,680
无法冲破敌人在城市上空的空中防御
They can't get through enemy air defenses over the city.

1808
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,250
我们的卫星被破坏了
Our satellites have been jammed.

1809
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,550
没法监控敌军的行动
We have no way to monitor the enemies movement.

1810
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,110
全部鸟巢部队都撤退了
All NEST teams are on stand down.

1811
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:34,850
只剩空军基地的兵力
Only have troops at air force base, move out.

1812
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:36,240
离战区10分钟航程
10 minutes from the battle zone.

1813
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,110
我们派出特种部队争取进城
We have special forces trying to gain access to the city.

1814
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:40,820
一个步兵团往周边地区进发
An infantry is staging at the perimeter.

1815
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:43,220
听我说  听我说  这真荒谬 
Excuse me, excuse me, it just doesn't make sense.

1816
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,960
我们就不能派眼线进去吗
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1817
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,080
他们不停地击毁我们的无人驾驶战机
They keep shooting down our drones.

1818
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,480
他们就是要我们看不见
They want us blind.

1819
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:52,380
但我们还有几架小型遥控飞机可以一试
But we do have a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.

1820
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,880
如果我们可以操纵这些无人机
Well if we can man these UAV drones,

1821
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,980
我们可以把它们落向川普大厦吗
...Can we try to redirect them toward, Trump Tower?

1822
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,180
那小子威特维奇正赶往芝加哥
The kid, Witwicky was on his way to Chicago.

1823
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,980
在霸天虎到之前
Set some point man human ops there,

1824
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,080
派小股侦查兵过去
before the Decepticons.

1825
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,580
听着  据我所知 
Listen, if I know anything, I know this.

1826
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:09,580
那小子就是外星人的黑仔
That kid is an alien bad news magnet.

1827
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,580
我的天
My God.

1828
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:55,280
我们要在这种情况进城找她吗
We came here to find her in the middle of all that?

1829
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,030
我们真要进去吗  爱普斯
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1830
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,080
我不进去
I'm not going in there.

1831
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,580
没人进去
No one's going in.

1832
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,280
我去
I am.

1833
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,680
有没有你们  我也要找到她
With or without you, I'll find her.

1834
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,480
你这相当于自杀  山姆
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.

1835
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,680
这就是你来的目的吗
Is that what you want?

1836
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,080
这就是你来的目的吗
Is that what you want?

1837
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,960
你大老远跑来就是要送死吗
You came all the way out here to get yourself killed.

1838
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,860
听到我的话了吗
Huh? Listen...to me what I'm saying.

1839
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,460
她在这里全因为我
She's here because of me, do you understand?

1840
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,560
听着  如果你进去
Listen, if you go in this building.

1841
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:28,360
就算她还活着
That's if she's even still alive.

1842
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,190
你也没法救她
There's no way you're going to be able to even reach her.

1843
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:31,370
那你有什么好建议吗
Well what would you suggest I do.

1844
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,860
结束了
It's over.

1845
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,980
很遗憾  但都结束了 
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1846
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,780
不
No.

1847
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,940
敌人来了
Woah, incoming!

1848
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,050
我们会把他们全干掉
We will kill them all.

1849
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:37,590
营救车  杀了他
Wreckers, kill him.

1850
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:43,490
这肯定很疼
This is going to hurt a lot.

1851
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,990
你们的首领现在应该明白
Your leaders will now understand.

1852
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:55,590
霸天虎不会放过地球的
Decepticons will never leave your planet alone.

1853
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:59,290
而我们要让他们以为我们已经走了
And we needed them to believe we had gone.

1854
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:02,610
今天  以自由的名义
For today, in the name of freedom,

1855
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:06,070
我们向他们宣战
we take the battle to them.

1856
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:29,570
我看着你们的飞船发射
I saw your ship blow up.

1857
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:32,470
我们没上船
The ship, we were never in the ship.

1858
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:35,030
这是我们设计好的
We designed the damn thing, didn't we.

1859
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:38,270
我们躲在一级推进火箭里被分离出来
We were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate,

1860
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:41,420
按计划落在大西洋
splashed down back in the Atlantic, just as planned.

1861
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,880
我们哪都没去
We ain't going no where.

1862
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:46,080
没人能驱逐我们
Yeah, no ones exiling us.

1863
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,580
汽车人仍然留在这里
The Autobots are just staying right here.

1864
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:52,750
我们要帮你们打赢这场仗
We're going to help you win this war.

1865
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:55,740
他们环城形成防御
They're surrounding the city to make a fortress.

1866
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,980
那样就没人看见他们在里面做什么了
So that no one can see what they're up to inside.

1867
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,860
我们唯一的机会就是奇袭
Our only chance is the element of surprise.

1868
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,640
我想我知道该去哪
I think I know where to look.

1869
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:08,710
小型无人侦查机靠近川普大厦
Mini-drones on approach, Trump Tower.

1870
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,300
你是要告诉我  山姆要进去吗
You're telling me, Sam's headed into that?

1871
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,460
可怜的娃儿
Poor kid.

1872
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,400
可能永远接近不了
Probably never got close.

1873
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,490
你能开这东西  是吗
Your gonna fly this thing, right?

1874
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,660
什么意思  那是什么意思
What does, what is that, what is that?

1875
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:26,740
还行
So, so.

1876
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:28,390
所以你还能凑合开
So you so, so can fly.

1877
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:29,590
这太可怕了
That feels terrible.

1878
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:33,340
我们支援你
We're right behind you.

1879
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:40,750
好吧
All right.

1880
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,990
我们进城
We're going in.

1881
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,700
城市被封锁了
The city's secure.

1882
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:12,330
人类无法阻止我们
The humans cannot stop us.

1883
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:14,230
下午以后
As the afternoon falls,

1884
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:18,100
剩下的传送柱会到达指定位置
the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position.

1885
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:23,470
这就是我多年以前向你承诺过的胜利
This is the victory I promised you so many years ago

1886
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,940
这就是我们重建赛博坦的地方
where we rebuild Cybertron.

1887
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,410
一起重建
together.

1888
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:34,610
跟你合作  我赢得的是星球的存活
I have gained to work with you that my planet may survive.

1889
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:37,790
我绝不会听命于你
I will never work for you.

1890
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:42,430
你要是明智  就应该记得这差别 
And you would be wise to remember the difference.

1891
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:05,650
烦死我了  等得真心烦 
Oh, I'm so sick of this. I'm sick of waiting.

1892
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:11,010
她在哪
Where is she?

1893
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,640
她在哪
Where is she!?

1894
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:15,150
你真是勇气可嘉
You've got some balls.

1895
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,260
不  山姆
No, Sam!

1896
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:34,550
不
No!

1897
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:40,050
卡莉
Carly!

1898
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,650
卡莉
Carly!

1899
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:46,750
跳
Jump.

1900
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,650
大黄蜂  开火
Bee, fire.

1901
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,350
救他  大黄蜂
Help him, Bee.

1902
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:49,750
汽车人  他们还活着
Autobots, they're alive.

1903
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:52,140
汽车人他们在这里
They're here, Autobots.

1904
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,800
霸天虎保护传送柱
Decepticons defend the pillar.

1905
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:57,040
升起桥
Release the bridges.

1906
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,410
找到他们
Find them.

这是小型军用无人侦查机

1914
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,250
检查看看是否还游泳

随便做点什么
Can you do something?

1919
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:51,160
我认为我们收到信号了

爱普斯  看到爱普斯了

行了  他们能看见我们

1928
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:06,460
芝加哥是一片废墟  明白吗

而且他有空间桥的部件

1932
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:14,060
他们在芝加哥河畔的一座建筑的楼顶
They're on top of a building on the Chicago river.

1933
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,460
他们有一大群人对这里进行封锁
So they have whole bunch school doing investment

1934
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,160
控制柱控制一切
The control pillar controls everything.

1935
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,560
就在东南的圆塔
In the southeast cupola.

1936
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,660
你们要向控制柱开火  必须把控制柱打下来
You gotta shoot the pillar. You have to shoot down the pillar.

1937
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,400
否则他们就要把赛博坦运到这里了
Or they're going to transport Cybertron here,

1938
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,590

-东南方的圆塔  -就这样

1946
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:38,510
我们得在敌机发现之前转移

在这里等我们去找路

我们走

1949
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:43,350
救护车  高空掩护
Ratchet, cover high.

1950
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,710
可能用那火箭炮把控制柱打掉吗
Hey, think you could use that rocket to shoot down the pillar?

1951
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:48,050
我们有八条街的距离
We're eight blocks away.

1952
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:49,750
需要靠近点才能开火
We gotta get closer to take a shot.

1953
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:51,350
不是靠近  而是要高点
Not closer, higher.

1954
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:52,950
我们需要清晰的视线

1955
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,150
而且是在河对岸
And it's across the river.

1956
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:56,050
还需要时间偷偷地接近

1957
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,550
只有一发炮弹

1958
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:00,150
一发就够了
One shot's all we need.

1959
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:03,630
我们的能从地面观察那座楼

1960
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:06,650
让国家安全局发来那里所有摄像头的说明
Get NSA to send service specs for any cameras in that area.

1961
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:07,850

1965
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:16,360
我们要穿翼装进去
We're going to have a wing-suit in.

1966
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:17,960
这是唯一的靠近方式

1967
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,080
我不能向你们保证能平安归来  
I can't promise anyone a ride home,

1968
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:22,060
但如果你们和我一起去

现在世界需要你们

听着  我们要绕到那玻璃楼
Listen, we're going to circle around to that glass building.

1984
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:54,680
那有足够的高度来发射火箭炮
We'll get high enough to make the rocket shot.

1985
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:56,980
你们去分散他的火力  走

为了牺牲的兄弟们
For our brothers.

2049
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,610
我们要让这次行动值回票价
Let's make this trip worth it.

2050
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:36,330
老天
Oh, oh God.

2051
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:40,220
楼怎么了   楼怎么了
Whoa, this building oh the building.

2052
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:46,300
他们在向大楼射击

2053
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:51,140
这不是个好主意  
This is not a good idea.

2054

This is not a good idea, the building's not stable.

Just stop for a second. We don't do what we can do.

2057
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:56,700
那就没意义了  反正我们都要死
Then it doesn't matter, we all die.

2058
01:53:56,710 --> 01:53:58,210
是吧  全看你了  加油
Right? It's your time, come on man.

2059
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:00,270
楼塌了我也没办法
I'm incapable of collapse.

2060
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:01,960
反正我有心脏病
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

2061
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,090
楼正往下倒
The building is going over.

2062

好了  停下了
It's okay, it's done.

2064
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,780
大家  注意
Guys, look.

2065
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:29,040

都藏起来
Everybody hide.

打碎玻璃
Shoot the glass.

2074
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:22,390
山姆

2075
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:49,000
大家都没事吗
Is everyone okay?

2076
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:51,100
你还好吗
You okay?

2077
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:52,890
下面那是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

2078
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,840
那个独眼怪看到我了
This Zevo thing is looking at me.

2079

往回走

2082
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:38,900
它爬上来了  楼梯不能走了
It's coming up, the stairs are blocked.

2083
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:41,800
我们怎么离开
Hey, how do we get out of here.

2084
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:42,970
快点
Hey, come on.

2085
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:45,760
上帝  只要让我活着离开
Oh lord, just let me get out of this alive.

2086
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,740
我愿意把养老金全给你

走  我们得离开

2088
01:57:57,890 --> 01:57:59,950
为什么霸天虎总是那么牛逼

01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:46,120
抓住她
You know, got her.

2093
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,270
把她扔到防火通道
Let's drop her to the fire escape.

2094
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:08,820
山姆
Sam!

2095
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:10,900

下去  快
Get down, move.

2097
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:26,680
我来帮你们
I'm coming for you.

2098
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:23,920
擎天柱
Optimus!

02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:25,270
营救车  
Wreckers.

2100
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,600
我们来了
We're coming.

2101
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:29,830
全世界的霸天虎
Decepticons around the world.

2102
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:32,160
启动传送柱
Launch the pillars.

2103
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,750
我们被丢弃了
Ahh, we are so lost.

2104
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,390
我们总是被忽略
Always left out.

2105
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,860
但也不错
Excellent.

2106
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,240
现在可以说了算了
It's time to lay down the law.

2107
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:15,770
给他们点厉害看看
By to be the hurt now.

2108
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:24,970
开始启动了
They're starting.

2109
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:26,500
看到了吗
You see it.

2110
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:30,500
找掩护
Get down.

2111
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,590
山姆和卡莉去哪了
Where is Sam and Carly?

2112
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:44,330
我们往这边跑
We can run this way.

2113
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:53,230
我就交给你这一件事
I give you one thing to do.

2114
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,600
就是看好他们  你竟然都搞砸了
One thing to do and you drop the ball on that.

2115
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,010
我可从没答应承担这义务
I never signed for all of this.

2116
02:01:57,190 --> 02:01:59,430
外星人轰炸我  四处追我

I'm ducking in churches and

2118
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,890
穷于应付
buildings and all that kind of crap, maybe.

2119
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:03,510
去你的吧  我可没答应这些  爱普斯
This is bullshit, I didn't sign up for this, Epps.

2120
02:02:04,870 --> 02:02:06,030
我尽力不吵了
I'm trying to keep it down.

2121
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:13,440
真是难得  就只有你们和我
What a treat, you and me.  Alone.

2122
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:20,660
快  快跑
Come on, come on. Let's run.

2123
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:25,540
他是在追我  不是你
Okay, he's after me not you.

2124
02:02:25,890 --> 02:02:27,170
快逃
Wait run, run.

2125
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:31,080
臭小子  你无处可藏了

2126
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,000
跑  快跑

2127

看你们忙着用小虫腿跑路

2130
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:48,340
本以为你还会为我们效力呢  小子
Thought you were working for us, boy.

2131
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:54,430

- You've got to save him. - What is he doing?

2138

做好这管用
This better work.

2139
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:03,270
我看不见了
Ow, ow, ow. I can't see, I can't see.

2140
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:04,630

你们这些人类
You humans.

2145
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,010
炸弹还有二十秒爆炸

2146
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:16,690
什么炸弹

2151
02:04:56,210 --> 02:04:57,120
他完蛋了
Well he's dead.

好了  大黄蜂去召集其他汽车人
Okay, he's going to run with

2153
02:05:02,150 --> 02:05:03,510
在河边和我们会合
the rest of the Autobots, meet us at the river.

2154
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:04,210
明白
All right.

2155
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,820
他把我吸进来  我也没办法 
He sucked me in, there was nothing I could do.

2156
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:39,170
这里是霸天虎的集簇群
Uh oh. This is a total cluster form.

2157
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,790
我们必须要过河
We gotta get across the river.

2158
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:42,940
看那里
You see that?

2159
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:44,860
卡莉说控制柱就在第一个圆塔里
She said the control pillar is in that first cupola.

2160
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:47,550
走  我们行动
Go, move. Let's move.

2161
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:50,100
战斧导弹已发射
Tomahawks are inbound.

2162
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,620
预计二十分钟后到达
ETA, twenty minutes.

2163
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:55,090
我入侵了交通摄像头
I'm in the traffic cameras.

2164
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,460
有四个汽车人被抓住了
Four Aubobots are captured.

2165
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,220
天啊  我们孤立无援了
Oh my God, we're helpless.

2166

传送要开始了  那些脉冲电流闪得更快
It was set to happen. With those

2168
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:07,040
没有看到擎天柱
No sign of Optimus.

2169
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:09,090
怎么才能把桥放下
How do we get these bridges down?

2170
02:06:11,090 --> 02:06:12,300
散开  四处查看
Spread out, check in there.

2171
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:18,260
爱普斯  你在这  你来干什么
Epps, you're here, what are you doing?

2172
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:19,270
时间紧迫
Time is wack.

2173
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:20,860
更糟的是  
Even worse,

2174
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:22,800
我们无法过桥到对面那座大楼
we can't get across the river to that dude.

2175
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,720
楼上的汽车人也全被包围了
And the Aubobots are upstairs surrounded.

2176
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:32,560
移动镜头看下周围好吗

2177
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,320
好  右移  说你呢

2178
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,900
派人去大桥控制室
Trying to get to that bridge control.

2179
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,650
他们在那里做什么  光站着不动
What are they doing there? They are just standing there.

2180
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:42,940
等等  管家
Hang on, Dutch.

2181
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,100
你能入侵大桥控制系统吗
See if you can hack into the bridge.

2182
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,920
长官  海豹突击队到了

2330
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:43,650
你可真惨
It's actually almost tragic.

2331
02:19:43,660 --> 02:19:47,090
你竟敢教训我  奴隶
You dare lecture me, slave.

2332
02:19:47,230 --> 02:19:49,720
你们霸天虎最终将征服这个星球
Your decepticons finally conquering this planet.

2333
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:50,940
但领袖不是你
And yet their leader wasn't you.

2334
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:55,440
是我  一定是我
It will be me, it will always be me.

2335
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,180
从此以后的每一刻
Any minute from now.

2336
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:00,380
他们会嘲笑你
They'll be laughing.

2337
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:02,680
你只是御天敌的婊子
You're Sentinels bitch.

2338
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,390
发射
Again!

2339
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:27,880
你选了阵营
You chose sides.

2340
02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:30,370
却选错了
You chose wrong.

2341
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:39,030
你一直都是我们中最勇敢的
Always the bravest of us.

2342
02:20:42,210 --> 02:20:45,090
但你却从未做过艰难的抉择
But you could never make the hard decisions.

2343
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:46,310
现在
Now!

2344
02:20:47,790 --> 02:20:50,610
我们的星球将存活
Our planet will survive.

2345
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:52,870
不
No.

2346
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:04,610
我们都曾是神
We were Gods once.

2347
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:05,900
我们每个人
All of us.

2348
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:07,110
但现在
But here,

2349
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:08,180
求你了
Please.

2350
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:10,650
只能有一个神
They'll only be one.

2351
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:25,690
这是我的星球
This is MY planet.

2352
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:38,260
我拯救了另一个世界
I just saved a whole other world.

2353
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:39,560
你认为你是英雄吗
You think you're a hero?

2354
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:41,430
你认为你是英雄
Huh, you think you're a hero.

2355
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:42,400
不
No.

2356
02:21:42,670 --> 02:21:44,130
我只是一个送信的
I'm just a messenger.

2357
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:53,200
它还在传送
It's still connected.

2358
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:56,670
小心  等下
Watch, wait up.

2359
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:58,920
-大黄蜂  -过来  过来
- B!  - Get going, get going. Let's move it.

2360
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,630
太空桥还在传送
Oh it's still connected.

2361
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:02,950
让它停下
Lets lock it that.

2362
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:27,440
不
No.

2363
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:29,970
我们先停战
We need a truce.

2364
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:33,500
我只是要重新夺回领导权
All I wanted was to be back in charge.

2365
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:35,260
再说
Besides...

2366
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:38,350
没有我  你也什么都不是
Who would you be without me?

2367
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:39,640
御天敌
Prime.

2368
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:41,990
我们走着瞧
Time to find out.

2369
02:23:04,570 --> 02:23:07,660
擎天柱  我只是想  
Optimus. All I ever wanted,

2370
02:23:07,670 --> 02:23:10,390
拯救我们的种族
was the survival of our race.

2371
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:15,120
你要明白  我为什么得背叛你
You must see why I had to betray you.

2372
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:17,420
你没有背叛我
You didn't betray me.

2373
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:20,320
你背叛了你自己
You betrayed yourself.

2374
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:22,500
不  擎天柱
No, Optimus!

2375
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:19,310
山姆
Sam.

2376
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:00,570
我爱你
I love you.

2377
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:02,340
我爱你

2378
02:25:03,470 --> 02:25:04,620
你是我在这世界的唯一
You're the only thing I need in this world.

2379
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:06,920
我会尽一切可能补偿你  我保证
And I'll do anything to make it up to you, I promise.

2380
02:25:08,150 --> 02:25:09,800
我会记住你的承诺
I'm gonna hold you to that.

2381
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:12,620
别再让我离开
Just never let me go.

2382
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,360
我保证
Promise.

2383
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:21,380
戒指
Rings.

2384
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:31,160
我爱这辆车
I love this car.

2385
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:32,930
但  你别这么心急
But, you gotta slow down.

2386
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:35,350
慢点来  好吧
You gotta slow way down. Okay.

2387
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:37,750
我只想帮忙
I'm just trying to help out.

2388
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:40,880
在任何战争中
In any war.

2389
02:25:41,050 --> 02:25:43,970
暴风雨间总有安宁
There are calms, between storms.

2390
02:25:44,710 --> 02:25:48,760
-你战斗很勇敢  -有时我们会失去信念
- You fought bravely. - There will be days when we loose faith.

2391
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:51,740
有时盟友会背叛我们
Days when our allies turn against us.

2392
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,480
但我们绝不会

2393
02:25:54,480 --> 02:25:56,960
放弃这个星球
That we forsake this planet.

2394
02:25:56,960 --> 02:25:58,540
也不会放弃人类
And it's people.

2395
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:24,810
这就是我所说的美好未来
That's what I called such a beautiful future

2396
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:27,440
逮捕他
Arrest him

2397
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,490
-这也值了  -把他带走
- It's worthy it - Get him out of here

2398
02:26:29,490 --> 02:26:31,610
我刚证明她是爱我的  我不在乎
I just got her for the love. I don't care.

2399
02:26:31,610 --> 02:26:36,770
把我抓起来吧
I want going. Take me in. I want going. Let's going
