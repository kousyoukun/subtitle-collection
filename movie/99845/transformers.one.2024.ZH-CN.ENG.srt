00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,470
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,470
好吧，让我们看看这里有什么。

3
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,400
Seen it. Seen it.

4
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,400
看过了。看过了。

5
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,700
Huh. What's this about?

6
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,700
嗯。这是怎么回事？

<i>为了保护我们的宇宙，他牺牲了自己的生命力，</i><i></i>

36
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,960
<i>为了帮助他们，Primus创造了一个强大的实体，</i><i></i>

<i>With the Matrix

Well, hello, guys.
I'm so glad you're here.

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,650
大家好。我很高兴你能来。

75
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,050
Which way is the exit?

76
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,050
出口在哪个方向？

77
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,590
I must've taken a wrong turn.

78
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,590
我一定是拐错弯了。

79
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,430
It's that defective mining bot,
Oreon Pix!

80
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,430
是那个有缺陷的采矿机器人，Oreon Pix！

81
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,890
Orion Pax.
Who cares?

82
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,890
猎户座Pax。谁在乎呢?

83
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,930
We told you
to never come back here!

84
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,930
我们告诉过你别再来这里！

85
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,900
Why are we all yelling?
I'm gonna smash you!

86
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,900
我们为什么都大喊大叫？我要打烂你！

87
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,570
Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

88
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,570
等一等。等等，等等。不需要暴力。

89
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,200
How about this:
I run away, you chase me.
We play that game. Huh?

90
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,200
这样怎么样：我逃跑，你追我。我们玩这个游戏。嗯?

91
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,240
Come on.
You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

92
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,240
来吧。你更大，更快。会很有趣的。

93
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,070
He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

94
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,070
他没有齿轮。让我们给他一个先机。

95
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,940
Why not?
It's not like
he can transform.

96
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,940
为什么不呢?他又不会变形。

97
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,910
Oh, yeah?

98
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,910
噢,是吗?

99
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,910
Well, watch this.

100
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,910
好吧，看看这个。

101
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,080
Get him!

102
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,080

103
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,590

106
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,290

Evening, everyone.
Pardon me.

126

127
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,950

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,950

133
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,040
Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

134
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,040
好吧,伙计们!谢谢你的抢先一步。

135
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
You want to give me

136
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
你想再给我一个吗？

137
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,880
You're dead!
I'll take that as a no.

138

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,550
哦……你说什么，无齿轮？

143
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,110
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean you.

144
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,110
对不起，先生，我不是说你。

145
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,980
I was referring
to the bot
who was behind you.

146
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,980
我指的是在你后面的那个机器人。

147
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,490
What? Where'd he go?

148
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,490
怎么啦？他去哪儿了？

149
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,950
The filthy
red and blue bot?

150
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,950
那个肮脏的红蓝相间的机器人？

151
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,920
Has a big mouth,
squeaky joints,

152
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,920
嘴巴很大，关节吱吱作响，

153
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,630
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

154
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,630
散发出金属腐蚀的恶臭？

155
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,320
Where is he?
He went that way.

156
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,320
他在哪里？他朝那边走去。

157
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,500
When I get
my hands on that bot...

158
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,500
等我拿到那个机器人…

159
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,230
All right, all clear.

160
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,230
好了，没事了。

161
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,870
Okay, D-16,
I may be a little rusty,

162
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,870
好吧，D-16，我可能有点生疏了，

163
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,550
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

164
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,550
但“腐蚀”?太远了。

165
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,680
Let me guess.
Chased out of
the archives?

166
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,680
让我猜猜。被赶出档案馆？

167
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,750
Yeah.
I had to jump
out of a window this time.

168
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,750
是的。这次我只能从窗户跳下去了。

169
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,550
Almost died.
It was wild.

170
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,550
几乎死亡。太疯狂了。

171
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,780
And digging through
ancient data
is worth dying for?

172
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,780
挖掘古代数据值得为之付出生命吗？

173
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,150
Yes, it is.

174
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,150
是的，它是。

175
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,620
I need a new best friend.

176
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,620
我需要一个新的好朋友。

177
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,530
If there are clues
in our recorded history

178
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,530
如果我们的历史记录中有线索

179
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,630
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

180
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,630
可以帮助找到领导力矩阵，

181
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,020
they're in the archives.

182
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,020
它们在档案馆里。

183
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,390
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

184
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,390
擎天柱，擎天柱

185
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,500
is up on the surface
right now,

186
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,500
现在就在海面上，

187
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,740
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

188
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,740
冒着生命危险寻找母体。

189
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,840
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

190
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,840
这正是我正在做的。我是想帮他。

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
Yeah, okay.

192
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
是的,好的。

193
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,170
The sooner Energon
flows again,

194
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,170
能量流得越快，

195
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,340
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

196
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,340
我们就不用挖矿了。

197
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,680
Don't you want
to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

198
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,680
难道你不想选择自己的道路，做你想做的事吗？

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,340
We're miners.
We mine, that's all.

200
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,340
我们的矿工。我们是我的，仅此而已。

201
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,850
No, there has got to be
something more I can do.
I can feel it.

202
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,850
不，我肯定还能做些什么。我能感觉到。

203
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,890
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

204
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,890
噢,是吗?就像你有一种“感觉”

205
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,660
you could transform
without a cog?

206
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,660
没有齿轮你也能变形？

207
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,450
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

208
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,450
你说过你不会再提那件事的。

209
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,890
Took me three days
to pry you open.

210
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,890
我花了三天才把你撬开。

211
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,030
Your feelings
get you in trouble.

212
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,030
你的感觉会给你带来麻烦。

213
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,570
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,570
是的,是的。

215
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,800
Just trust
in Sentinel Prime.
I do trust in him.

216
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,800
只要相信哨兵擎天柱。我确实信任他。

217
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,460
Hey, if we did have cogs--

218
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,460
如果我们真有齿轮的话

219
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,740
I'd transform
into a shovel
and beat you.

220
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,740
我会变成铁锹揍你。

221
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,680
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

222
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,680
我不喜欢你回答得这么快。

223
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,580
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

224
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,580
但听着，如果你真的赢了我，我不会给你这么棒的

225
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,850
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

226
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,850
我这里有威震天王。天气凉爽。

227
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,820
I'll give it
to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?

228
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,820
我把它给别人。什么威震天王的东西？

229
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,690
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

230
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,690
啊，没什么。只是，你知道，

231
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,990
mint-condition Megatronus Prime
decal, first edition.

232
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,990
全新威震天王贴花，第一版。

233
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,590
What?

234
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,590
怎么啦？

235
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,450
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

236
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,450
如果你不想要，我可以把它扔掉。

237
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,060
Throw it away? Don't--
That's not funny.
Let me see.

238
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,060
扔掉？别——这一点都不好笑。让我看看。

239
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,450
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

240
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,450
等待。不要抓住。你要把它弄皱。

241
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,100
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

242
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,100
哨兵说威震天是

243
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,000
The strongest Prime
to ever live.

244
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,000
有史以来最强大的擎天柱。

245
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
I know, buddy.

246
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
我知道，伙计。

247
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,680
Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool.

248
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,680
你穿起来很好看。啊，真的很酷。

249
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,550
Thanks.
Always got your back.

250
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,550
谢谢。永远支持你。

251
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,950
No matter what.

252
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,950
无论如何。

253
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,120
<i>Approaching sublevel station.
Stand clear of doors.</i><i></i>

254
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,120
<i>接近分段站。请远离门。</i><i></i>

255
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,050
<i>Mining teams,
prepare to unload.</i><i></i>

256
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,050
<i>采矿队，准备卸货。</i><i></i>

257
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,540
Metal to the pedal, drill bits.
This is it.

258
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,540
金属到踏板，钻头。就是这里。

259
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,010
How much Energon have you mined
under my leadership?

260
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,010
在我的领导下，你们开采了多少能量？

261
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,340
So much, Elita-1!

262
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,340
够了，Elita-1！

263
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
And how perfect
is my mining record?

264
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
我的采矿记录有多完美？

265
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,850
So perfect, Elita-1!

266
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,850
太完美了，Elita-1！

267
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,220
We are a mere
30 units of Energon away

268
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,220
我们只差30单位能量了

269
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,250
from my promotion to supervisor.

270
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,250
从我升职为主管开始。

271
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,820
Are you happy for me?

272
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,820
你为我高兴吗？

273
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,220
So happy, Elita-1!

274
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,220
太高兴了，Elita-1！

275
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,990
Elita-- I mean Captain,

276
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,990
埃莉塔，我是说船长，

277
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,700
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

278
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,700
你今天早上看起来特别有光泽。新波兰吗?

279
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Orion Pax,
I'm sorry that I somehow

280
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
猎户座帕克斯，很抱歉我不知怎么

281
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,490
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

282
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,490
让你以为我们是朋友。

283
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,970
Apology accepted.

284
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,970
接受道歉。

285
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,710
Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

286
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,710
把那面墙点亮！我们走吧!十秒!

287
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,330
Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

288
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,330
很高兴今天能带队，上尉。

289
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,970
Feeling like I have
enough power in me

290
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,970
感觉自己有足够的力量

291
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,880
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

292
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,880
亲自去接触普里默斯

293
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,540
You don't have
the touch or the power.

294
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,540
你没有那种触觉和能力。

295
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,750
Ready positions,
rust buckets! Let's go!

296
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,750
各就各位，铁锈桶！我们走吧!

297
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,680
She's in a good mood today.
Mm-hmm.

298
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,680
她今天心情很好。嗯哼。

299
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,410
You ready?
Always ready.

300
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,410
你准备好了吗?总是准备好了。

301
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,050
Let's punch in.

302
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,050
我们打卡吧。

303
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,760
Here we go.
This one won't be open long.

304
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,760
开始吧。这家店开不了多久。

305
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,090
Brace it up!

306
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,090
振作起来！

307
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,020
Here we go! Bridge!

308
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,020
我们开始吧！桥!

309
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,260
Brace up!

310
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,260
振作起来!

311
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,600
Lower channel is open.

312
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,600
下通道打开。

313
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,360
Drill power on max!

314
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,360
开足马力！

315
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,460
Low bridge!

316
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,460
桥低!

317
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
Drill it out!

318
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
把它钻出来！

319
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,610
I tapped a vein!

320
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,610
我敲了一下静脉！

321
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,450
It's unstable!
We got to go, we got to move!

322
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,450
不稳定!我们得走了，快走！

323
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,490
Evacuate!

324
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,490
撤离!

325
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,100
Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

326
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,100
每个人都出去!立即撤离!

327
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,770
The tunnel is closing.

328
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,770
隧道正在关闭。

329
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,770
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

330
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,770
重复，隧道要关闭了！

331
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,940
You with me, D?
On your six! Keep going!

332
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,940
你跟得上我吗，D？六点钟方向！继续前进!

333
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,910
Look out!

334
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,910
当心!

335
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,280
Jazz is stuck!

336
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,280
爵士被困住了！

337
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

338
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
艾丽塔，有个矿工被困了。

339
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,310
I'm falling back to assist.

340
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,310
我后退去协助。

341
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,090
<i>Negative.
Do not break protocol.
Evacuate!</i><i></i>

342
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,090
<我>负的。不要破坏协议。撤离!< / i >

343
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,220
We're gonna need more lift.

344
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,220
我们需要更多的力。

345
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,580
It's closing!
Just grab your pack and go.

346
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,580
关闭!拿上你的背包就走。

347
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,830
Yeah. Good idea.

348
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,830
是的。好主意。

349
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,160
What? No, I didn't mean it!

350
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,160
怎么啦？不，我不是那个意思！

351
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,800
Pull him clear!

352
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,800
把他拉出来！

353
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,600
<i>Pax, what's happening?</i><i></i>

354
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,600
帕克斯，发生什么事了？< / i >

355
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,300
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

356
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,300
没有什么要紧的事。只是正常的协议遵循的东西。

357
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,910
It's all good.

358
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,910
一切都很好。

359
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,240
Oh, that's not good.

360
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,240
哦，那可不太好。

361
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,820
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

362
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,820
猎户座·帕克斯，你能离开死亡隧道吗？

363
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,920
<i>Elita, it's about
to get messy out there!</i><i></i>

364
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,920
Elita，外面要乱起来了！< / i >

365
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,060
Go, go, go!

366
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,060
快，快，快！

367
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,860
Run! Run!

368
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,860
快跑!快跑!

369
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,690
Hurry!
We're not gonna make it!

370
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,690
快点!我们赶不上了！

371
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,800
Come on! Go, go, go!

372
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,800
来吧!快，快，快！

373
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,670
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

374
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,670
搞什么鬼，帕克斯？我告诉过你撤离。

375
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,240
I did, eventually.
If I get fired because of you--

376
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,240
我最终做到了。如果我因为你被炒了

377
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,210
Oh, please.
They're not
gonna fire you.

378
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,210
哦,请。他们不会解雇你的。

379
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,640
Elita-1, you're fired.

380
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,640
艾丽塔一号，你被解雇了。

381
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,710
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

382
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,710
怎么啦？为什么?我严格遵守了礼仪。

383
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,650
That is true.
I was the one
who broke the rules.

384
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,650
这是真的。是我打破了规则。

385
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,320
No one asked you!

386
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,320
没人问你！

387
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,620
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard
for this.

388
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,620
暗翼，求你了，为了这个我太努力了。

389
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,690
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

390
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,690
你们是没有齿轮的机器人，选择有限。

391
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,360
Report to waste management
immediately.

392
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,360
立即向废物管理部门报告。

393
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,030
Waste management?

394
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,030
废物管理?

395
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,030
Elita...
Next time,
why don't you stop and think

396
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,030
Elita……下次，你为什么不停下来想想

397
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,560
before you ruin someone's life?

398
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,560
在你毁了别人的生活之前？

399
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,730
I'm sorry!

400
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,730
我很抱歉!

401
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,110
Hey, Darkwing!
Don't do it.

402
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,110
嘿,Darkwing !不要这样做。

403
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,340
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

404
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,340
我也许没有齿轮，但我的手指可以变形。

405
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,280
Guess which one?
I'll give you
a "limited option."

406
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,280
猜猜是哪一个？我会给你一个“有限的选择”。

407
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,920
Excuse me, sir.

408
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,920
对不起，先生。

409
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,820
Allow me.

410
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,820
请允许我。

411
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,250
I apologize
on his behalf for the--

412
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,250
我代表他向你道歉

413
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,790
Why?

414
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,790
为什么?

415
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,670
That really hurt.

416
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,670
真的很痛。

417
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,210
What'd you expect?
He's metal.

418
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,210
你想要什么？他是金属。

419
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,880
You know you were
out of line,

420
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,880
你知道你太过分了，

421
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,110
talking back
to a superior like that.

422
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,110
跟上级顶嘴。

423
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,280
Darkwing was out of line.
He deserves it.

424
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,280
暗翼太过分了。这是他应得的。

425
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,580
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

426
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,580
你难道不厌倦我们被当作废物对待吗？

427
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,020
He had every right
to hit me.
I interfered.

428
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,020
他完全有权利打我。我干扰。

429
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,750
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

430
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,750
我很感激你支持我。

431
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,870
I'm glad
you were there with me

432
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,870
我很高兴你和我在一起

433
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,460
to get punched in the face.
That was fun.

434
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,460
被人打脸。那很有趣。

435
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,690
Anytime, buddy.

436
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,690
随时,老兄。

437
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,600
<i>Attention, all sectors.</i><i></i>

438
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,600
<i>各部门请注意。</i><i></i>

439
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,730
<i>Stand by for
a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i><i></i>

440
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,730
<i>等待哨兵Prime的实时传输。</i><i></i>

441
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,640
He's back?
He's back already?
Maybe he found the Matrix.

442
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,640
他回来了吗?他已经回来了？也许他找到母体了。

443
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,210
<i>Is it on? Okay, thank you.</i><i></i>

444
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,210
<i>开了吗？好的，谢谢。</i><i></i>

445
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,050
<i>Hello, my friends.</i><i></i>

446
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,050
<i>大家好。</i><i></i>

447
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,610
<i>Hello, Iacon City!</i><i></i>

448
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,610
你好，Iacon市！< / i >

449
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,250
<i>Hello to our saviors,
the industrious miners</i><i></i>

450
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,250
<i>向我们的救星，勤劳的矿工们问好</i><i></i>

451
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,260
<i>who toil selflessly to maintain
our Energon reserves.</i><i></i>

452
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,260
他们无私地辛勤劳作以维持我们的能源储备。

453
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,190
<i>I celebrate you.</i><i></i>

454
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,190
<i>我为你庆祝。</i><i></i>

455
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,560
Humility and presence!
That's leadership!

456
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,560
谦卑和风度！这是领导!

457
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,530
Ah! Nobody does it better!

458
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,530
啊!没有人做得更好！

459
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,300
<i>Once again, I have narrowly
returned with my fleet</i><i></i>

460
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,300
<i>再一次，我带着我的舰队险胜返回</i><i></i>

461
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,970
<i>after another
treacherous expedition</i><i></i>

462
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,970
<i>在另一次危险的探险之后</i><i></i>

463
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,340
<i>across the desolate, dangerous
surface of our planet.</i><i></i>

464
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,340
<i>穿越我们星球荒凉、危险的表面。</i><i></i>

465
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,880
<i>I departed with hopes
of finding
the Matrix of Leadership,</i><i></i>

466
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,880
<i>我带着找到领导矩阵的希望离开了，</i><i></i>

467
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,080

468
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,080
<i>为塞伯坦带来平衡的关键。</i><i></i>

469
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,110
<i>I regret to inform you</i><i></i>

470
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,110
<i>我很遗憾地通知你</i><i></i>

471
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,510
<i>that we've
returned empty-handed.</i><i></i>

472
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,510
<i>我们空手而归。</i><i></i>

473
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,150
<i>This is a setback,
but not a failure.</i><i></i>

474
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,150
<i>这是一次挫折，但不是失败。</i><i></i>

475
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,190
<i>Rest assured, I will find
the Matrix of Leadership,</i><i></i>

476
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,190
<i>请放心，我会找到领导力矩阵，</i><i></i>

477
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,650
<i>so that Energon can flow again.</i><i></i>

478
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,650
<i>使Energon可以再次流动。</i><i></i>

479
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,460
<i>But that's in the future.</i><i></i>

480
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,460
<i>但那是将来的事。</i><i></i>

481
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,760
<i>Right now,
I think we all

482
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,760

<i>Tomorrow,

484
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,300

<i>My favorite event.</i><i></i>

<i>A high-octane race

492
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,870
<i>一场横跨Iacon市的高强度比赛。</i><i></i>

493
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,150
<i>Let's all see which competitor

495
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,790
D.

496
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,790
D。

497
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,560
Psst! Hey, D.

498
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,560
嘘!嘿,D。

499
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,440
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

500
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,440
太好了，你起来了。来吧，我有个主意。

501
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,370
Whatever this is,
it better be good.

502
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,370
不管这是什么，最好是好事。

503
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Listen.

504
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,080
对，对，对，对。好吧。听。

505
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,180
All right, what if...
what if...

506
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,180
好吧，如果……如果……

507
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,680
what if tomorrow

508
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,680
如果明天呢？

509
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,520
we ran
in the Iacon 5000, huh?

510
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,520
我们开的是Iacon 5000 ？

511
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,490
What if kill you
for waking me up?

512
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,490
不如杀了你，因为你吵醒了我？

513
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,220
No, no, no, hear me out.

514
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,220
不，不，不，听我说完。

515
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,690
We don't even have to win!

516
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,690
我们甚至不需要赢！

517
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,060
Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

518
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,060
太好了，因为我们不会。

519
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,260
But-- But if we beat
just one Transformer,

520
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,260
但如果我们能打败一个变形金刚，

521
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
it proves
we're just as good as they are.

522
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
这证明我们和他们一样优秀。

523
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,400
Not only would we
go down in history,

524
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,400
我们不仅会被载入史册，

525
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,730
the mining bots
that did the impossible,

526
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,730
采矿机器人完成了不可能的任务，

527
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,600
but we would show everyone
that we're--

528
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,600
但我们会向所有人展示我们是

529
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,670
we're capable
of so much more!

530
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,670
我们有能力做更多！

531
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,010
Or we get
publicly humiliated

532
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,010
否则我们会被公开羞辱

533
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,740
and then busted
back to tier one.

534
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,740
然后又回到了第一层。

535
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,680
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

536
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,680
是啊，但至少我们会做点什么？

537
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,310
Pax...
Come on, D.

538
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,310
罗马帝国……得了吧，D。

539
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,780
Pax.

540
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,780
Pax。

541
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,650
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

542
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,650
我们是不会变形的采矿机器人。

543
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,880
We can't fly,
we can't roll,

544
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,880
我们不能飞，我们不能滚，

545
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,220
we can't race.

546
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,220
我们不能比赛。

547
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,290
Come on, let's go.

548
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,290
来吧，我们走。

549
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,290
All right, fine.

550
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,290
好吧，没问题。

551
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,030
Yeah, maybe you're right.

552
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,030
也许你是对的。

553
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,100
Maybe.

554
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,100
也许吧。

555
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,670
The Iacon 5000
is finally here!

556
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,670
Iacon 5000终于来了！

557
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,240
I have a surprise
for you. Come on.

558
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,240
我有个惊喜要给你。来吧。

559
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,440
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

560
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,440
你要去哪里？体育馆在那边。

561
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,110
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Follow me.

562
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,110
是的，是的，我知道。跟我来。

563
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,220
Great.
We're gonna be late now.

564
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,220
太好了。我们要迟到了。

565
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,350
I wanted good seats.

566
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,350
我想要好座位。

567
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,220
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony.
This is wonderful!

568
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,220
我们大老远来就是为了错过开幕式。这太棒了！

569
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,990
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

570
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,990
相信我，我知道我在做什么。

571
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,060
Hold up!

572
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,060
举起!

573
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,760
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you
halfway across the city.

574
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,760
如果被困在其中，你就会被炸飞半个城市。

575
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,360
Okay,
where are you taking me?

576
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,360
好吧，你要带我去哪？

577
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,760
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

578
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,760
别犯傻了，这绝对值得。相信我。

579
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,110
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

580
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,110
嘿，你不是个小故障。

581
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,800
Look, I know this is, like,
fun for you,

582
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,800
我知道这对你来说很有趣，

583
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,370
like, we're joking around,

584
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,370
就像我们在开玩笑，

585
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,970
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

586
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,970
但如果你让我错过了艾康5000的任何部分

587
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,540
I swear I will smelt
your face right off your...

588
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,540
我发誓我会从你的…

589
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,320
<i>Welcome to the Iacon 5000.
There they are.</i><i></i>

590
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,320
欢迎来到Iacon 5000。

591
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,620
<i>Put your hands together
as today's competitors
are taking the field.</i><i></i>

592
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,620
<i>把你的手放在一起，因为今天的竞争对手正在领跑。</i><i></i>

593
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,590
Look! There's
Thunderglide and Behemoth!

594
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,590
看！有迅雷滑翔和巨兽！

595
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,270
This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

596
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,270
真是难以置信！我觉得我在比赛！

597
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,030
You did this for me?

598
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,030
你这么做是为了我？

599
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,140
No.

600
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,140
不。

601
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
I did this for us.

602
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
我这么做是为了我们。

603
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,680
<i>And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.</i><i></i>

604
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,680
<i>现在是你们期待已久的时刻。</i><i></i>

605
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,420
<i>The icon of Iacon!</i><i></i>

606
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,420
<i> icon的图标！< / i ></i>

607
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,550
<i>The savior of Cybertron!</i><i></i>

608
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,550
塞伯坦的救世主！< / i >

609
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,160
<i>Quintessons fear him,
but we love him!</i><i></i>

610
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,160
学生害怕他，但我们爱他！< / i >

611
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,330
<i>Our leader,
the one and only...</i><i></i>

612
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,330
<i>我们的领袖，独一无二的…</i><i></i>

613
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,130
<i>Sentinel Prime!</i><i></i>

614
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,130
<我>哨兵' !< / i >

615
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,430
I love you, Sentinel!

616
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,430
我爱你，哨兵！

617
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,140
Yes! It feels so good
to be here with you all today.

618
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,140
是的!今天和大家在一起感觉很好。

619
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,670
My friends.
My Cybertronian family.

620
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,670
我的朋友。我的塞伯坦家族。

621
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,040
It has been
precisely 50 cycles

622
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,040
正好是50个周期

623
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,580
since the Quintessons
attacked our home.

624
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,580
自从Quintessons袭击我们家之后

625
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,120
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

626
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,120
自从我们失去领导力矩阵已经有50个周期了

627
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,750
and our Energon supply
dried up.

628
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,750
我们的能源供应枯竭。

629
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,820
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

630
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,820
从杀死其他超级战士的战斗开始已经过去了50个周期，

631
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,790
my brothers
and sisters in arms.

632
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,790
我的兄弟姐妹们。

633
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,020
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

634
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,020
今天我们向为我们牺牲生命的超级英雄致敬

635
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,730
and we show them
that the strength of Cybertron
will never be diminished.

636
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,730
让他们知道塞伯坦的力量永远不会被削弱。

637
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,570
Racers, on your marks!

638
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,570
选手们，各就各位！

639
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,220
I can't believe we get to watch
from the starting line.

640
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,220
真不敢相信我们能站在起跑线上观看比赛。

641
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,750
The best seats
in the house!

642
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,750
最好的座位！

643
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,850
Why'd you bring jetpacks?

644
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,850
你为什么带着喷气背包？

645
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,590
<i>Get set!</i><i></i>

646
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,590
<我>设置!< / i >

647
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,390
It's time to show them
we are more than meets the eye.

648
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,390
是时候向他们展示我们的真面目了。

649
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,790
Oh, no.

650
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,790
哦,不。

651
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,860
<i>And they're off!</i><i></i>

652
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,860
<i>他们走了！< / i ></i>

653
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,900
Are you crazy?
Sure feels like it.

654
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,900
你疯了吗？感觉就是这样。

655
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,900
<i>The Iacon 5000 has begun!</i><i></i>

656
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,900
icon 5000已经开始了！< / i >

657
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,780
I'm sorry, are those
miners in the race?

658
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,780
抱歉，那些矿工也在竞选吗？

659
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,220
Miners!
Those are miners,
like us!

660
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,220
矿工!他们是矿工，和我们一样！

661
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,110
<i>I can't believe
what I'm seeing here!
Miners trying to run</i><i></i>

662
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,110
我简直不敢相信我在这里看到的！试图运行的矿工

663
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,820
<i>in the Iacon 5000!</i><i>
You've got to be kidding me.</i>

664
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,820
<i>在Iacon 5000！</i><i>你一定是在开玩笑。</i>

665
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,920
<i>This is insane!</i><i></i>

666
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,920
这太疯狂了！< / i >

667
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,560
There are miners
in the race!
Miners?

668
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,560
比赛中有矿工！矿工吗?

669
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,790
No way!
They can't even transform!

670
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,790
没门!他们连变形都不会！

671
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,630
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

672
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,630
这是猎户座帕克斯和D-16！

673
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,030
<i>This is a first
in Iacon 5000 history.</i><i></i>

674
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,030
<i>这是Iacon 5000历史上的第一次。</i><i></i>

675
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,130
<i>How are they going to survive?</i><i></i>

676
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,130
<i>他们将如何生存？< / i ></i>

677
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,000
If we survive this,
I'm gonna kill you!

678
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,000
如果我们能活下来，我就杀了你！

679
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,480
I accept those terms.

680
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,480
我接受这些条件。

681
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,850
<i>It's Tailwind
pulling into the lead
down the main stretch</i><i></i>

682
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,850
<i>顺风在主拉伸段拉入领先位置</i><i></i>

Hey, look out!

686
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,620
嘿，小心！

687
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,730
I owe you one.
More like a thousand.

688
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,730
我欠你一个人情。更像是一千。

689
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,930
I can't believe
we're not in last place!

690
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,930
真不敢相信我们不是最后一名！

691
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000
Eat it, miner!

692
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000

Hey!
Jetstorm, I'm so sorry.
Big fan!

705
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,110
And... now!

706
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,110

707
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,910
Move!

708
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,910
动!

709
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,180
<i>And the miners
have fallen way behind.</i><i></i>

710
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,180
<i>矿工们已经远远落在后面了。</i><i></i>

711
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,050
<i>We can now focus
on the real contenders
in this race.</i><i></i>

712
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,050
<i>我们现在可以关注这场比赛中真正的竞争者了。</i><i></i>

713
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,350
<i>I don't believe it!

714
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,350
我不相信！矿工们干掉暗翼！< / i >

715
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,040
Oh, miners!

716
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,040
哦,矿工!

717
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,780
Great effort,
Darkwing!

718
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,780
干得好，暗翼！

719
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,620
That worked!
It actually worked!

720
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,620
那工作!它真的起作用了！

721
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,790
Is this the dumbest thing
we've ever done?

722
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,790
这是我们做过的最蠢的事吗？

723
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,330
Oh, yeah, it's up there!

724
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,330
哦，是的，它在上面！

725
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,260
No, no, no!

how long do you think
we'll be here?

我不会跟你说话的。

You know what?
I can't believe
you made me do that.

780

你知道吗？真不敢相信你让我这么做。

781
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,820
We are so screwed!
Thought you weren't
talking to me.

782

我们完蛋了！我以为你不和我说话了。

783
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,950
Hey, look, I know
it's all a big joke to you.
But not me.

784
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,950
听着，我知道这对你来说是个大笑话。但我不是。

785
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,180
I was paying my dues.
I was going places.

786
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,180
我付了我的会费。我要去很多地方。

787
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,560
And now they're gonna
bust me down

788
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,560
现在他们要把我抓起来

789
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,020
I-- I don't even know
how many tiers!

790
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,020

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,830
I'm sorry, D.

792
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,830
对不起，D。

793
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,560
But come on,
didn't you feel it?

794
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,560
拜托，你感觉不到吗？

795
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,660
Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

796
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,660
哪怕只有一秒钟，你不觉得解放了吗？

797
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,290
Didn't you feel like
you were something else?

798
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,290
难道你不觉得自己是另一个人吗？

799
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,160
Like you could be more
than what they say you are?

800
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,160
好像你能比他们说的更好吗？

801
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,870
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

802
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,870
是的，我感觉到了。我做到了。

803
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,540
But it doesn't matter.

804
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,540
但没关系。

805
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,910
We're going to get
punished and demoted.

806
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,910
我们会受到惩罚，被降职。

807
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,010
Sentinel Prime
saw the whole thing.

808
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,010
哨兵擎天看到了整个过程。

809
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,280
This is so embarrassing.

810
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,280
这太尴尬了。

811
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,960
It's clear.

812
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,960
很明显。

816
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,870
D-16。

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,510
What you two did today

818
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,510
你们俩今天干了什么

819
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,100
was one of the
craziest things
I've ever seen.

820
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,100
是我见过的最疯狂的事情之一

821
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,610
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

822
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,610
先生，这都是我的主意，我们很抱歉。

823
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,040
I loved it!

824
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,040
我喜欢它！

825
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,110
You did?

826
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,110
你做了吗?

827
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,980
How could anyone
not love it?

828
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,980
怎么会有人不喜欢呢？

829
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,750
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

830
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,750
你给了我最好的车手一场真正的比赛。

831
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,150
So we're not
getting demoted?

832
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,150
所以我们不会被降职？

833
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,350
Demoted?

834
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,350
降级?

835
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,450
Demoted.

836
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,450
降级。

837
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,460
What is happening?

838
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,460
发生了什么？

839
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,260
The fact of the matter
is we're halfway
into the first shift

840
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,260
事实是我们第一班才上了一半

841
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,640
since the race ended
and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

842
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,640
自从比赛结束，采矿人员已经达到了150%的配额。

843
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,780
You inspired them
to work harder!

844
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,780
你激励他们更加努力工作！

845
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,880

846
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,880
哨兵一号，长官，

847
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,150
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

848
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,150
我们参加比赛是为了向大家展示我们的潜力。

849
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,080
That we bots can do
more than just mine--

850
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,080
我们机器人能做的不仅仅是我的

851
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,410
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

852
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,410
杰出的!我喜欢能独立思考的机器人。

853
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,150
Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

854
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,150
也许你们俩可以参观一下矿场，

855
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,450
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

856
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,450
和你的兄弟们谈谈，帮助他们看到自己的潜力。

857
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,600
Wow! Okay, great.

858
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,600
哇!好了,好了。

859
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,390
That sounds incredible.

860
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,390
听起来不可思议。

861
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,290
I would love to--
Sir, it's time.

862
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,290
我很乐意先生，时间到了。

863
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,930
Ah, yes.

864
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,930
啊,是的。

865
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,600
I'm sorry, friends.

866
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,600
对不起，朋友们。

867
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,670
We're preparing
our next travel
to the surface.

868
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,670
我们在准备下一次的地表之旅。

869
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,470
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

870
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,470
但与此同时，我要招待你。

871
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,610
Hang tight.
Airachnid, have someone
escort these heroes

872
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,610
挂紧。蜘蛛，派人护送这些英雄

873
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,470
to my personal
service facilities.

874
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,470
我的私人服务设施。

875
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,470
Best care in Iacon.

876
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,470
在Iacon得到最好的照顾。

877
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,310
Until next time, legends.

878
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,310
下节课见，传奇。

879
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,090
Sentinel Prime.
The Sentinel Prime!

880
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,090
哨兵撇。擎天柱哨兵！

881
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,190
You still mad at me?
I am less mad at you.

882
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,190
你还在生我的气？我没那么生你的气了。

883
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,830
I'm telling you, D--
I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

884
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,830
我跟你说，小迪，我有种感觉一切都会改变

885
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,990
and we're gonna go--

886
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,990
我们要去

887
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,830
Miners!

888
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,830
矿工!

889
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,900
Hi, Darkwing.

890
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,900
嗨,Darkwing。

891
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,470
Oh, no, no, no.
No!

892
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,470
哦，不，不，不。不!

893
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,040
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

894
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,040
等等,等等!你不明白！

895
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,540
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

896
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,540
我们应该去哨兵擎天柱的服务舱！

897
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,850
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

898
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,850
你们两个笨蛋再也见不到人了。

899
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,340
I'll make sure of that.

900
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,340
我会确保的。

901
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,650
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

902
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,650
你搞错了！问哨兵!

903
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,790
I hate that guy!

904
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,790
我讨厌那个家伙！

905
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,330
You! How did you get down here?

906
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,330
你!你是怎么下来的？

907
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,070
There's no access to this level.

908
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,070
无法进入这一层。

909
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,100
There is nobody
down here but me.

910
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,100
这里除了我没人。

911
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,650
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

912
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,650
天啊，你是真的！

913
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,880
You're others!
You're not... me!

914
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,880
你是别人的!你不是…我!

915
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,620
You're here,
and you're not me!

916
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,620
你在这里，你不是我！

917
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,850
Uh, yeah.
Awesome!

918
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,850
嗯,是的。太棒了!

919
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,350
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

920
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,350
我很抱歉。那对你来说一定很奇怪。

921
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,550
I just haven't had
a lot of company

922
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,550
我只是没几个人陪我

923
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,660
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

924
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,660
从他们把我关在50层开始。

925
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,930
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

926
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,930
五十?但是只有40个子级别。

927
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,590
That's what I thought!

928
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,590
我也是这么想的！

929
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,560
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

930
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,560
原来还有十多只，而且都不讨人喜欢。

931
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,330
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

932
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,330
也许这就是为什么没有人真正谈论它们的原因。

933
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,740
How long have you
been down here?

934
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,740
你在这里多久了？

935
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,400
How long have I been here?

936
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,400
我在这里多久了？

937
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

938
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
让我想想，在很长一段时间和永远之间？

939
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,340
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

940
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,340
我是说，我有其他工作，但我一直被重新分配

941
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,210
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

942
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,210
因为我很擅长我的工作。

943
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,250
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

944
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,250
哦!顺便说一下，我是B-127。

945
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,720
But you can call me B.

946
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,720
但是你可以叫我B。

947
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,380
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

948
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,380
我还在想一些昵称呢。

949
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,090
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

950
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,090
我现在漂浮的那个是巴达萨天。

951
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,860
Which is actually pronounced...
"Badassatron."

952
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,860
实际上发音是…“Badassatron。”

953
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,230
But if you have any critiques--

954
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,230
但如果你有任何意见

955
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,230
Yeah, great.
How do we get
out of here?

956
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,230
是的,很好。我们怎么离开这里？

957
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,160
Great question. You don't.

958
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,160
好问题。你不。

959
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,770
We don't?
Nope.

960
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,770
我们不?不。

961
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,070
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

962
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,070
我们进入垃圾管理区的权限有限，

963
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,140
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

964
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,140
但那里的新轮班经理不喜欢分心。

965
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,180
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

966
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,180
不，他们更希望我们留在这里完成手头的任务。

967
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,750
Which is?
Oh!

968
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,750
是哪一个?哦!

969
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,690
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

970
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,690
废料从那里的斜槽进来

971
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,480
onto the conveyor belt.

972
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,480
放到传送带上。

973
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,420
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

974
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,420
我们的工作是寻找任何可能值得打捞的东西

975
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,120
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

976
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,120
在它进入熔炉被熔炼之前。

977
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,160
So you watch garbage burn.

978
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,160
所以你看着垃圾燃烧。

979
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,650
Yes!

980
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,650
是的!

981
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,290
It is so great
that you're here now.

982
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,290
你能来真是太好了。

983
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,190
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

984
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,190
我迫不及待地想了解你的一切。

985
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,030
And then tell you
everything about me!

986
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,030
然后告诉你关于我的一切！

987
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,940
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

988
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,940
我有很多希望和梦想，我很想和大家分享

989
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,270
with one or two
new best friends.

990
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,270
和一两个新的好朋友。

991
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,470
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

992
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,470
是啊，我很乐意

993
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,140
Where are my manners?

994
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,140
我的礼貌哪儿去了？

995
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,940
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

996
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,940
来吧，我把你介绍给其他船员。

997
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
Hey, guys, we've got company!

998
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
伙计们，有人来了！

999
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,750
This is EP-508,

1000
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,750
这是EP-508，

1001
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,510
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

1002
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,510
这是A-A-Tron，这位是Steve。

1003
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,920
"Steve"?
Yeah, he's foreign.

1004
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,920
“乔布斯”?是的，他是外国人。

1005
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,890
Do they talk back to you?

1006
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,890
他们会和你顶嘴吗？

1007
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,190
Um, they're not real.

1008
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,190
嗯，他们不是真的。

1009
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,830
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

1010
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,830
天啊，你觉得我有那么疯狂吗？

1011
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,290
It's just
you've been down here a--

1012
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,290
只是你在这里待了这么久

1013
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,870
No, I was talking to Steve.

1014
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,870
不，我在和史蒂夫说话。

1015
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,490
Classic Steve.

1016
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,490
经典的史蒂夫。

1017
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,300
What is that?
Look at this guy.

1018
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,300
那是什么？看看这个家伙。

1019
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,330
It's coming from inside.

1020
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,330
它是从内部发出的。

1021
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,840
Oh! Steve! No!

1022
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,840
哦!史蒂夫!不!

1023
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,040
I am so sorry.
Steve, no!

1024
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,040
我很抱歉。史蒂夫,不!

1025
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,140
We can fix it, don't worry.
My Steve!

1026
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,140
我们能修好的，别担心。我的史蒂夫!

00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,340
天博智!

1043
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,640
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

1044
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,640
这些是地表上某个位置的坐标。

1045
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,240
This could be
where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

1046
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,240
这里可能是擎天柱在Quintesson战争中死去的地方。

1047
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,680
Which means
this is where we could find

1048
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,680
也就是说我们可以在这里找到

1049
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,020
the Matrix of Leadership.

1050
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,020
《领导力矩阵》

1051
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,550
What are you talking about?
It's an old beacon
inside a statue made of garbage.

1052
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,550
你在说什么？这是一个在垃圾雕像里的旧灯塔。

1053
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,190
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

1054
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,190
或者这是我们如何找到的线索

1055
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,960
the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!

1056
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,960
《领导力矩阵》不。不可能。绝对不是!

1057
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,760
Hey, D, come on,
this could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

1058
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,760
D，别这样，这是我们向大家展示我们不是…的机会

1059
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,200
You already tried
to "show everyone"

1060
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,200
你已经试着“向所有人展示”了

1061
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,730
in the race
you tricked me
into running,

1062
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,730
在你骗我参加的比赛中，

1063
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,100
which got us
stuck down here

1064
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,100
是什么把我们困在这里的

1065
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,530
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

1066
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,530
在这个废物坑里，拿着这个…

1067
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,470
really cool guy.

1068
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,470
很酷的家伙。

1069
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,700
Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying--

1070
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,700
哦，谢谢。我只是说——

1071
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,510
There's a reason
no one goes
to the surface.

1072
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,510
没人去地表是有原因的。

1073
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,240
It's dangerous!

1074
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,240
是很危险的!

1075
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,610
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime
finds us.

1076
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,610
我就在这里等着哨兵擎天柱找到我们。

1077
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,480
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

1078
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,480
哦,好的。是的。嗯。

1079
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,550
Well, we'll just
stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

1080
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,550
好吧，我们就永远呆在这里。你没意见吧，B？

1081
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,960
Forever? This is great!

1082
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,960
到永远吗?这太棒了！

1083
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,190
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

1084
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,190
我有了新的同事和室友。

1085
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,120
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

1086
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,120
既然史蒂夫死了，还有很多空间。

1087
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,260
I usually sleep
on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

1088
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,260
我通常睡在传送带上，但你完全可以睡。

1089
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,790
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

1090
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,790
我会睡在阿创旁边的角落。

1091
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,530
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

1092
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,530
也有足够的空间让你伸展身体，

1093
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,930
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

1094
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,930
因为你比我高。明白我的意思吗？

1095
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,040
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be
if you personally handed him

1096
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,040
D，你觉得如果你亲自交给哨兵他会有什么反应

1097
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,010
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

1098
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,010
你发现的领导力矩阵？

1099
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,910
Okay, stop.
I know what you're
trying to do.

1100
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,910
好了,停止。我知道你想干什么。

1101
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,180
And it's
definitely working.
I'm in.

1102
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,180
这绝对是有效的。我在。

1103
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,710
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
How do we get
to the surface?

1104
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,710
哈,哈!是的,朋友。我们怎么到地面上去？

1105
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,890
Pfft! You kidding me?
The surface?

1106
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,890
啐!开什么玩笑？表面吗?

1107
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,020
Easy. I know a way.

1108
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,020
一件容易的事。我知道一个办法。

1109
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,780
But it won't be easy.

1110
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,780
但这并不容易。

1111
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,750
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

1112
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,750
为什么有这么多垃圾？啊!

1113
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,130
Warn me
next time, please.
My mouth was open.

1114
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,130
下次请提醒我。我张着嘴。

1115
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,620
Only 49 sublevels to go!

1116
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,620
只有49个子级别去！

1117
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,790
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

1118
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,790
废物处理列车是唯一的交通工具

1119
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,970
that go all the way
to the surface.

1120
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,970
一直延伸到表面。

1121
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,430
Yeah, but they
don't allow passengers.
The trains are autonomous.

1122
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,430
是的，但是他们不让乘客进去。火车是自动驾驶的。

1123
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,830
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

1124
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,830
是啊，这就是“不容易”的部分。

1125
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,310
It's perfect.
We'll be safe
inside the train.

1126
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,310
它是完美的。我们在火车里是安全的。

1127
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,410
That's the last one.
Send 'er up!

1128
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,410
这是最后一个。让她上来！

1129
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,160
Hold up! One more.

1130
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,160
举起!一个。

1131
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,530
I'll lock it down.

1132
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,530
我会把它锁起来的。

1133
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,830
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

1134
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,830
不管你是谁，谢谢你这么傻。

1135
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,980
Turning you in will
definitely get me promoted
back up a rank or two.

1136
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,980
告发你肯定能让我升回一两个级别。

1137
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,020
Got her!

1138
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,020
了她!

1139
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,210
No, wait, I--

1140
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,210
不，等等，我

1141
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,550
Elita! Stop!

1142
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,550
Elita !停!

1143
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,350
Orion?
Hold on, let me--

1144
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,350
猎户星座吗?等等，让我——

1145
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,580
Security! Sound the ala--

1146
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,580
安全!发出ala的声音——

1147
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,900
She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this.

1148
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,900
她往引擎那边去了！别担心，我能行。

1149
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,230
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

1150
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,230
等等，让我解释一下！我们在执行任务！

1151
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,400
So am I. To ruin your life.

1152
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,400
我也是，毁了你的生活。

1153
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,020
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where--

1154
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,020
Elita等。我们发现了一条信息。我们知道——

1155
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,880
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

1156
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,880
这个机器人疯了！她是谁？

1157
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,420
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

1158
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,420
死路一条，伊莉塔。不可能……

1159
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,620
Well, she's gone.

1160
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,620
好吧，她走了。

1161
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,900
Whoa!

1162
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,900
哇!

1163
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,830
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

1164
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,830
为什么?我为什么要这么做？我为什么要这么做？

1165
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,980
Climb faster!

1166
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,980
快爬!

1167
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,290
Gotcha!

1168
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,290
明白了!

1169
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,660
Ah, the surface.

1170
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,660
啊，表面。

1171
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,200
It's beautiful.

1172
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,200
它是美丽的。

1173
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,140
I am speechless.

1174
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,140
我无语了。

1175
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,630
Elita, listen to me.

1176
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,630
伊莉塔，听我说。

1177
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,900
We know where
the Matrix of Leadership is.

1178
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,900
我们知道领导力矩阵在哪里。

1179
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,940
Oh, sure.
And I'm really a Prime.

1180
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,940
哦,当然。我真的是Prime会员。

1181
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,350
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

1182
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,350
我只是更喜欢装一箱箱有毒废物。

1183
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,840
Whoa.
Where did you get this?

1184
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,840
哇。你从哪儿弄来的？

1185
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,610
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

1186
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,610
来自我的朋友史蒂夫。俄里翁杀了他。

1187
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,090
I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive.

1188
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,090
我没有杀史蒂夫。他从未活过。

1189
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,490
What?
Look.

1190
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,490
怎么啦？看。

1191
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,690
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

1192
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,690
哨兵告诉我们他要去地表，

1193
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,590
and then we found this message.

1194
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,590
然后我们发现了这个信息。

1195
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,820
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

1196
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,820
我们想我们可以亲手交给他

1197
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,820
or scout
the locations ourselves.

1198
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,820
或者我们自己去侦察地点。

1199
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,130
Whichever comes first.

1200
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,130
先到的那个。

1201
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,700
This was too important to wait.

1202
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,700
这件事太重要了，不能再等了。

1203
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,400
It will change all of our lives.

1204
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,400
它将改变我们所有人的生活。

1205
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,210
No, no, no, no.

1206
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,210
不，不，不。

1207
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,510
I'm not going to get demoted
again because of you.

1208
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,510
我不会再因为你被降职了。

1209
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,380
I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying the--

1210
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,380
我要调头，我要通知

1211
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,310
Hey, guys? Guys?

1212
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,310
嘿,伙计们?人吗?

1213
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,380
What is that?

1214
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,380
那是什么？

1215
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,010
Is it getting bigger?

1216
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,010
它越来越大了吗？

1217
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,850
Or closer?

1218
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,850
还是近?

1219
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,930
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1220
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,930
不，不，不，不！

1221
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,540
Are you closing?
Don't close. Stop closing.

1222
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,540
你们要打烊了吗？不要关闭。停止关闭。

1223
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
It's closed!

1224
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
它是封闭的!

1225
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,740
Oh, come on!

1226
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,740
哦，别这样！

1227
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,780
Oh, now I know why
no one comes to the surface!

1228
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,780
哦，现在我知道为什么没有人浮出水面了！

1229
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,540
<i>Elita?</i><i></i>

1230
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,540
<我> Elita吗?< / i >

1231
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,870
Elita?

1232
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,870
Elita吗?

1233
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,350
You okay?

1234
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,350
你没事吧?

1235
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,610
Please stop
punching me in the face.

1236
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,610
别再打我的脸了。

1237
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,810
Can you help?

1238
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,810
你能帮忙吗？

1239
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,650
Iacon-- The train--

1240
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,650
艾康——火车——

1241
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,880
Where's the train?
Relax, okay? Here it comes.

1242
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,880
火车在哪里？放松,好吗?它来了。

1243
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,920
And there it goes.

1244
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,920
就这样。

1245
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,050
Okay, I was wrong about that.
It was going the other way.

1246
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,050
好吧，我错了。相反的方向。

1247
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,240
Okay, so I think
this is us,

1248
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,240
好吧，我想这就是我们，

1249
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,770
and if we follow
the path to--
Now you listen to me,

1250
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,770
如果我们沿着这条路走现在你听我说

1251
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,350
Mr. "Zero Seconds
Since My Last Accident"!

1252
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,350
先生。“距离上次事故零秒”！

1253
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,450
I'll go on your little quest
because I don't have a choice.

1254
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,450
我会继续你的小任务，因为我别无选择。

1255
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,320
But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,

1256
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,320
但我带着地图，我在导航，如果一无所获，

1257
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,920
then I'm dragging you
and those two idiot go-bots

1258
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,920
那我就拖着你和那两个白痴机器人

1259
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,320
back to Iacon City

1260
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,320
回到艾肯市

1261
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,990
and to the first
supervisor depot we see,

1262
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,990
我们看到的第一个监工仓库，

1263
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,960
at which point you will explain
everything that's happened,

1264
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,960
然后你就会解释发生的一切，

1265
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,760
using words that reflect me

1266
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,760
用能反映我的语言

1267
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,030
in a very positive light!
Got it?

1268
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,030
以一种非常积极的方式！明白了吗?

1269
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,300
Yeah, okay.
Deal. Great. All right.

1270
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,300
是的,好的。交易。太好了。好吧。

1271
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,640
Let's go!
She's joining us?

1272
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,640
我们走吧!她要加入我们？

1273
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,270
Fantastic!

1274
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,270
太棒了!

1275
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,670
Hi there. Uh, Elita, right?
Am I saying that right?

1276
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,670
嗨。呃，是埃莉塔，对吧？我说的对吗？

1277
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,940
Wanted to formally
introduce myself.

1278
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,940
我想正式介绍一下我自己。

1279
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,610
I'm B-127. You kneed me
in the face earlier, back there.

1280
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,610
我是b - 127。你之前在那用膝盖打了我的脸。

1281
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,290
You can call me B,
or Badassatron.

1282
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,290
你可以叫我B，或者Badassatron。

1283
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,050
It's a nickname
some of the guys gave me.

1284
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,050
是一些人给我起的绰号。

1285
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,460
I don't know. I didn't give it
to myself or anything.

1286
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,460
我不知道。我不是给自己吃的。

1287
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,560
Actually, it's pronounced...
"Badassatron,"

1288
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,560
实际上，它的发音是……“Badassatron。”

1289
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,660
in case you were wondering.

1290
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,660
如果你想知道的话。

1291
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,960
Badassatron.

1292
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,960
Badassatron。

1293
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
You like that, right?

1294
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
你喜欢这样，对吧？

1295
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,160
Badass--
I'm gonna need you
to talk less.

1296
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,160
混蛋，我要你少说话。

1297
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,930
Sure! No-- Yeah, no problem.

1298
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,930
当然!不——是的，没问题。

1299
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,640
What am I talking less about,
my nickname?

1300
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,640
我少说了什么，我的昵称吗？

1301
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,940
That's fine with me.
Got some mountains over here...

1302
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,940
我没意见。这里有一些山…

1303
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,840
Hey. You're thinking
about what you'll say

1304
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,840
嘿。你在想你要说什么

1305
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,810
when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?

1306
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,810
当你把母体交给哨兵时，是吗？

1307
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,110
I can't help it.

1308
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,110
我没办法。

1309
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,380
D, we're really doing this.

1310
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,380
D，我们真的在做这个。

1311
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,850
So glad
I'm out here with you.
This was a great idea.

1312
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,850
很高兴能和你在一起。这是个好主意。

1313
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,490
I'm just having a good time.

1314
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,490
我只是玩得很开心。

1315
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,050
How much further
is the Matrix on the map?

1316
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,050
矩阵在地图上还有多远？

1317
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,560
Make an educated guesstimate.

1318
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,560
做一个有根据的猜测。

1319
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,530
This is the coolest thing
that has ever happened

1320
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,530
这是发生过的最酷的事

1321
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,490
to anyone anywhere,
I'm telling you!

1322
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,490

没有门，我们在外面。

1329
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,060
Hey, look,
there's more of it over here.

1330
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,060
嘿，看，这里还有更多。

1331
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,670
What is it?
It's not metal.

1332
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,670
这是什么？它不是金属。

1333
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,140
It's like some kind
of weird nature. It's weird.

1334
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,140
就像某种奇怪的天性。这很奇怪。

1335
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,540
So are they.

1336
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,540

Um...

1344
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,060
嗯…

1345
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,600
I think this is not right.
We should go.

1346
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,600
我觉得这样不对。我们该走了。

1347
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,430
Yeah, good idea.
Run!

1348
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,430
好主意。快跑!

1349
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,500
What are we running from?

1350
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,500
我们在逃避什么？

1351
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,560
What is that?
Oh, no.

1352
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,560
那是什么？哦,不。

1353
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,730
It's a Quintesson ship.
What?

1354
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,730
这是一艘Quintesson船。怎么啦？

1355
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,430
What do we do?
What do we do?
Shh! Quiet.

1356
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,430
我们该怎么办？我们该怎么办？嘘!安静。

1357
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,320
It's scanning for life-forms.
Move, move!

1358
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,320
它在扫描生命形式。动,动!

1359
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,280
Wait!

1360
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,280
等等!

1361
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,120
Go, go, go, go!

1362
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,120
快，快，快，快！

1363
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,260
Come on!

1364
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,260
来吧!

1365
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,000
They're not gonna make it.

1366
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,000
他们不会成功的。

1367
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,270
Whoa.

1368
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,270
哇。

1369
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
What-- What were they
searching for?

1370
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
他们在找什么？

1371
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,000
Someone to hug, B.
How should I know?

1372
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,000
B.我怎么知道？

1373
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,060
I'm not waiting around
to find out.

1374
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,060
我不会等着发现的。

1375
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,440
This way.
We're close.

1376
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,440
这种方式。我们接近。

1377
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,230
Quintessons haven't
been here for 50 cycles.

1378
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,230
Quintessons已经有50个周期没来了。

1379
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,910
It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

1380
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,910
这说不通啊。外面什么都没有。

1381
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,500
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

1382
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,500
有牙齿的洞穴。没什么可怕的。

1383
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,170
Knives coming
out of the ceiling. Amazing.

1384
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,170
刀子从天花板上冒出来。很神奇的。

1385
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,680
Everyone,
do we have to go insi--?

1386
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,680
各位，我们一定要进去吗？

1387
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,750
Okay, yep, we're going in.

1388
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,750
好了，我们要进去了。

1389
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,050
Why shouldn't we? Just walking
into the scariest place

1390
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,050
为什么不能呢？走进了最可怕的地方

1391
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,550
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

1392
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,550
我这辈子见过的最好的。

1393
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,620
This is ridiculous.

1394
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,620
这太荒谬了。

1395
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,980
I don't believe it.

1396
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,980
我不相信。

1397
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,110
The Primes.

1398
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,110
质数。

1399
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,880
We're here.

1400
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,880
我们在这里。

1401
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,860
Megatronus Prime.

1402
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,860
Megatronus撇。

1403
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,640
Zeta Prime.

1404
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,640
ζ撇。

1405
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,980
The Matrix!

1406
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,980
矩阵!

1407
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,550
It's gone.

1408
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,550
这是一去不复返了。

1409
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,480
Let's keep looking.

1410
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,480
我们继续找。

1411
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,720
Hey, guys!

1412
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,720
嘿,伙计们!

1413
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,600
It's Alpha Trion!

1414
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,600
是阿尔法狮王！

1415
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,700
He's powered down.

1416
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,700
他断电了。

1417
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,370
But his spark is still lit.

1418
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,370
但他身上的火花仍未熄灭。

1419
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,760
Quintesson ambush!

1420
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,760
Quintesson伏击!

1421
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,360
Attack!

1422
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,360
攻击!

1423
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,590
Message before--

1424
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,590
消息之前,

1425
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,800
Whoa, whoa, it's okay!
It's okay.

1426
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,800
哇，哇，没事的！没关系。

1427
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,640
You're safe now.

1428
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,640
你现在安全了。

1429
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,370
The war is over.

1430
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,370
战争结束了。

1431
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,360
I failed you, old friend.

1432
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,360
我让你失望了，老朋友。

1433
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,360
You deserved
so much better than this end.

1434
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,360
你不该落得这样的下场。

1435
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,970
No, you didn't fail.

1436
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,970
不，你没有失败。

1437
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,810
We heard your message.
We've come to find
the Matrix.

1438
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,810
我们听到了你的留言。我们是来找母体的。

1439
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,010
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

1440
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,010
你的转变很顺利。你怎么了？

1441
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,910
Who are you?

1442
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,910
你是谁？

1443
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,280
We're cogless miners,
from Iacon.

1444
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,280
我们是没有齿轮的矿工，来自艾肯。

1445
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,380
Miners? Why?

1446
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,380
矿工吗?为什么?

1447
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,820
Well, we've had
to drill for Energon

1448
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,820
我们不得不为能源公司钻探

1449
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,950
ever since
it stopped flowing.

1450
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,950
自从它停止流动。

1451
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,250
Impossible.

1452
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,250
不可能的。

1453
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,480
That's why we came.
To fix things.

1454
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,480
这就是我们来的原因。去解决问题。

1455
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,550
If we find
the Matrix of Leadership

1456
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,550
如果我们找到领导矩阵

1457
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,290
and get it to Sentinel Prime,
he can fix--

1458
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,290
把它交给哨兵擎天柱，他就能修好

1459
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,670
Sentinel is no Prime.

1460
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,670
哨兵不是王者。

1461
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,430
What?
He's broken.
Fantastic.

1462
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,430
怎么啦？他是坏了。太棒了。

1463
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,270
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

1464
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,270
你在说什么？你为什么这么说？

1465
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,170
Sentinel Prime
is our protector.

1466
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,170
守护者是我们的保护者。

1467
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,300
He's been saving us from
the Quintessons ever since--

1468
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,300
从那以后他就一直把我们从Quintessons手中拯救出来

1469
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,270
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

1470
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,270
你还没有得救。你一直活在谎言中。

1471
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,280
I saw the truth
with my own eyes.

1472
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,280
我亲眼看到了真相。

1473
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,410
Come. I will show you.

1474
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,410
来了。我来告诉你。

1475
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,890
For thousands of cycles,
the war with the Quintessons

1476
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,890
数千个轮回，与五世会的战争

1477
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,000
had been a brutal conflict.

1478
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,000
这是一场残酷的冲突。

1479
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,200
<i>Until Sentinel,
the principal aide
to the Primes,</i><i></i>

1480
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,200
<i>直到哨兵，质数的主要助手，</i><i></i>

1481
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,210
<i>intercepted an enemy transmission.</i><i></i>

1482
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,210
<i>截获了敌人的信号。</i><i></i>

1483
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:04,110
<i>There was going to be
a secret gathering
of Quintesson commanders.</i><i></i>

1484
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:04,110
<i>将有一个Quintesson指挥官的秘密聚会。</i><i></i>

1485
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,880
<i>Their elimination
could end the war.</i><i></i>

1486
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,880
<i>消灭他们可以结束战争。</i><i></i>

1487
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,050
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

1488
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,050
这是一项非常重要的任务，我们擎天柱自己承担了。

1489
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,320
We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,

1490
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,320
我们同意秘密会见哨兵获取他的敏感情报，

1491
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,960
here in this cave.

1492
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,960
就在这个山洞里。

1493
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,720
But we were not alone.

1494
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,720
但我们并不孤单。

1495
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,560
Quintessons!
They're here!

1496
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,560
Quintessons !他们在这里!

1497
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,070
It's a trap!
Battle positions!

1498
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,070
这是个陷阱！战斗位置!

1499
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,530
Hold the line!
Primus be with us!

1500
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,530
别挂线！普里默斯与我们同在！

1501
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,640
For Cybertron!

1502
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,640
塞伯坦传奇!

1503
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,350
<i>We were outnumbered,
but stood as one.</i><i></i>

1504
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,350
<i>我们寡不敌众，但团结一致。</i><i></i>

1505
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,580
<i>Our victory was near.</i><i></i>

1506
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,580
<i>我们就要胜利了。</i><i></i>

1507
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,060
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i><i></i>

1508
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,060
<i>直到我们被背叛。</i><i></i>

1509
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,550
Sentinel, why?

1510
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,550
哨兵,为什么?

1511
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,090
For all the power
of Cybertron.

1512
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,090
不管塞伯坦有多强大。

1513
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:32,660
<i>But Sentinel never
understood the true power
of what he desired.</i><i></i>

1514
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:32,660
<i>但是哨兵从来没有理解他所渴望的东西的真正力量。</i><i></i>

1515
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,730
<i>The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded</i><i></i>

1516
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,730
<i>领导矩阵只能被运用</i><i></i>

1517
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,700
<i>by one that Primus himself
deems worthy.</i><i></i>

1518
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,700
<i>被一个Primus自己认为值得的人。</i><i></i>

1519
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,410
<i>And Sentinel
most certainly was not.</i><i></i>

1520
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,410
<i>而Sentinel绝对不是。</i><i></i>

1521
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,480
No!

1522
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,480
不!

1523
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:58,790
Wait. Hold on. You're saying
that the Matrix of Leadership
just vanished?

1524
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:58,790
等待。等一等。你是说《领导力矩阵》消失了？

1525
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,460
No.

1526
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,460
不。

1527
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,870
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

1528
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,870
不，不，不。那是不可能的。我不相信。

1529
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,730
Why would Sentinel
do that?

1530
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,730
哨兵为什么要这么做？

1531
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,330
To make a bargain.

1532
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,330
做交易。

1533
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,270
A bargain? With who?

1534
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,270
讨价还价?与谁?

1535
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,510
With the new rulers
of Cybertron.

1536
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,510
塞伯坦的新统治者。

1537
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,480
The Quintessons.

1538
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,480
Quintessons。

1539
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,710
There are so many.

1540
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,710
有这么多。

1541
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,040
He's here.

1542
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,040
他在这里。

1543
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,280
Sentinel Prime is here.

1544
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,280
擎天柱哨兵来了。

1545
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,410
Keep your eyes open.
They always are.

1546
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,410
睁大你的眼睛。他们总是这样。

1547
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,990
I load those crates.

1548
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,990
我装那些箱子。

1549
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,420
Those are filled
with contaminated metal.

1550
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,420
里面装满了被污染的金属。

1551
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,130
I don't understand.

1552
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,130
我不明白。

1553
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,760
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

1554
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,760
Quintessons想用有毒废物做什么？

1555
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,100
Our Energon.

1556
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,100
我们的Energon。

1557
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,310
Traitor!
D, no.

1558
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,310
叛徒!D,没有。

1559
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,490
I know what
I promised you

1560
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,490
我知道我答应过你什么

1561
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,630
but our mines,
they're running out!

1562
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,630
但我们的地雷快用完了！

1563
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,830
There's barely
enough Energon for us.

1564
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,830
能量勉强够我们用。

1565
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,630
I swear I will
get you the rest.

1566
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,630
我发誓我会把剩下的给你。

1567
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,180
Triple-time
every mining shift.

1568
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,180
每次采矿班次增加三倍。

1569
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,870
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

1570
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,870
在我拿到能量之前，所有矿工都不能休息。

1571
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,550
All of it! Let's go.

1572
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,550
全部！我们走吧。

1573
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,400
Now you have seen the truth.

1574
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,400
现在你看到了真相。

1575
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,340
Every day...

1576
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,340
每一天…

1577
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,940
Every single day
of my life

1578
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,940
我生命中的每一天

1579
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,510
has been a lie.

1580
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,510
一直都是谎言。

1581
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,010
My God, I knew it!

1582
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,010
天哪，我就知道！

1583
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,880
Deep down,
I always felt
something was off.

1584
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,880
内心深处，我总觉得不对劲。

1585
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,390
He deceived everyone.

1586
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,390
他欺骗了所有人。

1587
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:53,560
Sentinel bought himself power
and then put us to work
paying off his debt.

1588
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:53,560
哨兵给自己买了权力然后让我们帮他还债。

1589
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,330
I can't believe it.

1590
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,330
我真不敢相信。

1591
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,860
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

1592
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,860
很明显，我可以相信

1593
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,700
I just saw it,
but I still...

1594
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,700
我刚看到，但我还是…

1595
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,730
I can't believe it.

1596
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,730
我真不敢相信。

1597
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,730
Sentinel lied

1598
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,730
哨兵撒了谎

1599
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,870
to my face.
It was all a sham.

1600
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,870
当着我的面。这一切都是假的。

1601
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,710
How could we
have been so gullible?

1602
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,710
我们怎么会这么容易上当受骗？

1603
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:12,350
Oh, this-- this is going
to change everything.

1604
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:12,350
这，这将改变一切。

1605
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,350
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

1606
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,350
你必须这么做，不是吗？

1607
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,690
Me? What did I do?

1608
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,690
我吗?我做了什么？

1609
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,520
You just had
to go to the surface,

1610
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,520
你只要走到水面上，

1611
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,560
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

1612
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,560
必须进入Iacon 5000

1613
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,130
You just had to break protocol!

1614
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,130
你非得违反规定不可！

1615
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,400
Who cares about protocol?
I do!

1616
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,400
谁在乎协议？我做!

1617
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,570
I care!

1618
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,570
我在乎!

1619
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,210
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

1620
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,210
因为只要你遵纪守法就不会有什么坏事发生！

1621
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,700
Sentinel Prime
has been forcing us

1622
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,700
Sentinel Prime一直在逼迫我们

1623
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,070
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

1624
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,070
在矿井里工作，直到我们的齿轮脱落，

1625
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,770
and all the while he's been
giving the Energon away
to our greatest enemies!

1626
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,770
而他却一直把能量器交给我们最大的敌人！

1627
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,780
And what do you think
he's going to do to us
when he finds out that we know?

1628
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,780
如果他发现我们知道了，你觉得他会怎么对我们？

1629
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,880
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

1630
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,880
我没在想他会怎么做，

1631
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,550
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

1632
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,550
我在想我们该怎么做。

1633
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,320
That's the whole thing!

1634
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,320
这就是全部！

1635
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,720
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

1636
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,720
你从来不考虑别的，只考虑你自己！

1637
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,050
Fantastic!
Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

1638
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,050
太棒了!另一个猎户座公园的总体规划。我等不及要听了。

1639
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,430
Don't you want
to stop him?

1640
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,430
你不想阻止他吗？

1641
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,330
No, I want to kill him!

1642
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,330
不，我要杀了他！

1643
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,270
I want to put Sentinel in chains

1644
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,270
我想把哨兵锁起来

1645
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,930
and march him
through the mines

1646
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,930
带他穿过矿井

1647
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,470
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

1648
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,470
这样每个人都能看到他是假的擎天柱！

1649
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:13,410
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

1650
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:13,410
我想让他受苦，然后在黑暗中死去。

1651
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,100
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

1652
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,100
但我们都知道这并不重要

1653
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,740
what I want, right, Pax?

1654
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,740
我想要的，对吧，帕克斯？

1655
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,350
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

1656
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,350
事实是，我们只是没有大脑的机器人。对吧?

1657
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:28,190
We had limited options,
and now... now we have none.

1658
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:28,190
我们的选择有限，而现在…现在我们没有了。

1659
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:34,460
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

1660
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:34,460
塞伯坦的儿子和女儿都有齿轮。

1661
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,400
Oh, yeah.
I've been with myself
since I came online,

1662
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,400
哦,是的。自从我上网后，我一直和自己在一起，

1663
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,370
and this slot's
always been empty.

1664
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,370
这个位置一直是空的。

1665
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,400
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

1666
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,400
你在说什么？你是说——

1667
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
No. No way.
Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

1668
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
不。不可能。没人会那么邪恶，哨兵也不行。

1669
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,450
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

1670
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,450
他在你上网前把你的齿轮拆了。

1671
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,650
We were born with
transformation cogs,
but he...

1672
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,650
我们生来就有变形的齿轮，但他…

1673
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,620
He took them from us.

1674
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,620
他从我们手中夺走了他们。

1675
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,850
What defines a Transformer...

1676
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,850
变压器的定义是什么？

1677
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,330
...is not the cog
in his chest

1678
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,330
…不是他胸口的齿轮吗

1679
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:08,360
but the spark
that resides in their core.

1680
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:08,360
而是他们内心深处的火花。

1681
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,700
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1682
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,700
给你意志让你的世界变得更美好的火花。

1683
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,200
My fellow Primes had that spark.

1684
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,200
我的同伴们也有这样的火花。

1685
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,250
And I see their strength
in you.

1686
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,250
我在你身上看到了他们的力量。

1687
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:30,320
Take their cogs
and access
your full potential.

1688
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:30,320
接受他们的建议，充分发挥你的潜力。

1689
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,450
Prima.

1690
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,450
表面上。

1691
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,980
Onyx.

1692
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,980
缟玛瑙。

1693
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,120
Alchemist.

1694
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,120
炼金术士。

1695
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,330
Micronus.

1696
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,330
Micronus。

1697
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:45,160
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

1698
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:45,160
战士的精神高尚，忠诚，力量强大。

1699
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,160
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

1700
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,160
它们的独特性因此而增强。

1701
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:20,440
They were one. You are one.

1702
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:20,440
他们是一体的。你就是其中之一。

1703
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,310
All are one!

1704
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,310
一切都是一体的！

1705
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,950
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

1706
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,950
等待。我们有…你给了我们…

1707
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:43,460
The ability
to change your world.

1708
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:43,460
改变世界的能力。

1709
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:48,630
How you choose
to use that power
is up to you.

1710
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:48,630
你选择如何使用这种力量取决于你自己。

1711
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:54,900
They've found us.

1712
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:54,900
他们找到我们了。

1713
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,610
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

1714
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,610
哦,是的!是时候反击了！

1715
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,480
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

1716
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,480
不。你必须回到艾肯城，通知所有人。

1717
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,980
Embedded in this
are the records
I have shown you.

1718
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,980
这里面有我给你们看的记录。

1719
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,450
Use it to reveal the truth.

1720
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,450
用它来揭露真相。

1721
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,820
We will.

1722
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,820
我们会的。

1723
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,950
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

1724
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,950
这条隧道通向山里。

1725
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,820
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

1726
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,820
塞伯坦的未来掌握在你手中。

1727
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,320
We're out of time.

1728
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,320
我们没时间了。

1729
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,960
We got to move!

1730
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,960
我们得走了！

1731
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,730
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

1732
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,730
等等，我们不能把你丢在这里。

1733
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,290
Your fight will come,
my friend.

1734
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,290
你的战斗终将到来，我的朋友。

1735
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,670
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

1736
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,670
普里默斯对我们都有意义。

1737
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,610
But this fight...

1738
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,610
但是这场战斗……

1739
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,510
This fight is mine.

1740
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,510
这场战斗是我的。

1741
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:36,010
Now go!

1742
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:36,010
现在去!

1743
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,430
Stand down, old timer.

1744
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,430
退下，老家伙。

1745
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,430
Ah. Old, you say?

1746
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,430
啊。你是说老了？

1747
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,220
Not too old for you.

1748
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,220
对你来说不算太老。

1749
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,230
We need to hurry!

1750
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,230
我们得快点了！

1751
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,930
I still think
we have better odds

1752
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,930
我还是觉得我们胜算更大

1753
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,700
fighting than outrunning them.

1754
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,700
与他们搏斗，而不是逃避。

1755
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,740
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

1756
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,740
等等!我们有齿轮。我们现在可以变换了。

1757
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,710
That's right.
Everyone ready?
I was born ready.

1758
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,710
这是正确的。每个人都准备好了吗?我生来就准备好了。

1759
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,370
On three. One--

1760
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,370
三。一个——

1761
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:50,850
Ah!

1762
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:50,850
啊!

1763
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,190
How do we use these things?

1764
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,190
我们如何使用这些东西？

1765
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,120
I don't know. Just try.

1766
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,120
我不知道。只是试一试。

1767
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,700
It's working. Ha! It's working!

1768
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,700
这是工作。哈!这是工作!

1769
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,540
My head! My head!

1770
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,540
我的头!我的头!

1771
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,600
Whoa!

1772
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,600
哇!

1773
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,440
Help! Help!

1774
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,440
的帮助!的帮助!

1775
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,650
This is not faster!

1776
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,650
这不是更快！

1777
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,550
Oh, come on!

1778
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,550
哦，别这样！

1779
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:24,650
And transform!

1780
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:24,650
和转换!

1781
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,690
Wheels! I need wheels!

1782
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,690
轮子!我需要轮子！

1783
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:39,390
Whoa.

1784
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:39,390
哇。

1785
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,660
Ha!

1786
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,660
哈!

1787
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,120
Oh, wow.

1788
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,120
哦,哇。

1789
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,660
We're alive!
I've never moved that fast.

1790
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,660
我们活着!我从来没这么快过。

1791
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,460
That was incredible!
Did you see me slide all over?

1792
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,460
太不可思议了！你看到我全身滑倒了吗？

1793
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,910
Yes!

1794
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,910
是的!

1795
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,500
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

1796
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,500
嘿，老兄。你没事吧?

1797
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,180
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

1798
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,180
我很好。你在开玩笑吗？我们可以变形！

1799
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,350
We transform!

1800
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,350
我们变换!

1801
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,980
Oh, hey! I know.

1802
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,980
哦,嘿!我知道。

1803
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,090
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

1804
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,090
我们在浪费时间。我们得回去找艾康。

1805
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,280
Looks like the fastest way

1806
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,280
看起来是最快的方法

1807
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,020
back to Iacon is--
Here, I got it.

1808
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,020
回到Iacon是这里，我知道了。

1809
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,520
Hey, what are you doing?

1810
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,520
嘿，你在干什么？

1811
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,220
Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful.

1812
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,220
别担心，我能行。是的，但是要小心。

1813
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,060
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

1814
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,060
我们的证据在里面，你却洒得到处都是。

1815
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:49,740
I... got... it.

1816
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:49,740
我…得到了……它。

1817
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,010
Okay.

1818
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,010
好吧。

1819
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,270
Follow me.

1820
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,270
跟我来。

1821
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,380
Alpha Trion!

1822
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,380
α揣恩!

1823
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,220
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

1824
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,220
你还活着。你看那个？

1825
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,030
You look horrible.

1826
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,030
你看起来很糟糕。

1827
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,160
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

1828
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,160
叛徒。你真丢人。

1829
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,430
Primus will surely--
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

1830
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,430
普里默斯肯定会——嗯哼。是的。闭嘴。

1831
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,240
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

1832
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,240
我抓住机会掌控了自己的未来。

1833
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,710
Anything to get
out of working for you

1834
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,710
只要不为你工作就行

1835
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,070
and that boring
council of elders.

1836
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,070
还有那个无聊的长老会议。

1837
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,270
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

1838
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,270
说真的，我会看你们超级英雄的

1839
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,410
spend half the day
losing a war

1840
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,410
花半天时间输掉一场战争

1841
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:38,250
and the other half
sitting around waxing poetic
about loyalty and honor.

1842
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:38,250
而另一半则坐在那里对忠诚和荣誉赞歌。

1843
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,550
And now look at you.

1844
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,550
现在看看你。

1845
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,390
Hear my words:
You will fall.

1846
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,390
听我说：你会倒下的。

1847
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,450
And a new Prime will rise--

1848
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,450
一个新的超级英雄将会崛起

1849
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,990
There you go again.

1850
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,990
你又来了。

1851
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,930
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

1852
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,930
我不想再听任何演讲了。

1853
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,740
There were others
in the cave with you.

1854
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,740
洞里还有其他人和你在一起。

1855
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,800
Who are they?

1856
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,800
他们是谁？

1857
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,940
They are to be your undoing.

1858
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,940
他们将是你的毁灭。

1859
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,370
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

1860
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,370
你输了，哨兵。你什么也做不了

1861
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,480
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

1862
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,480
我刚才不是说不许演讲吗？

1863
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,120
You heard me, right?

1864
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,120
你听到了，对吧？

1865
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,550
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

1866
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,550
这就是我说的。难以置信。

1867
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,450
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

1868
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,450
他们都是这样的。那么无礼。

1869
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,290
Okay. Hunt down the others.

1870
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,290
好吧。追捕其他人。

1871
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,630
With pleasure.

1872
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,630
与快乐。

1873
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,480
Hey, buddy.

1874
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,480
嘿,哥们。

1875
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,510
Oh. Hey.

1876
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,510
哦。嘿。

1877
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,320
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

1878
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,320
你最近有点沉默。你还好吗？

1879
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,650
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

1880
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,650
我满脑子都是哨兵的假笑。

1881
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:55,490
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

1882
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:55,490
他必须为他的所作所为付出代价。总得有人做点什么。

1883
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,700
We are. With Alpha's proof
inside that device,
we will show everyone the truth.

1884
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,700
我们是来旅游的。阿尔法的证据在装置里，我们会向大家展示真相。

1885
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,810
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

1886
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,810
你真的认为会那么容易吗？

1887
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,810
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

1888
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,810
艾康不想听真相。

1889
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,070
They worship Sentinel.

1890
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,070
他们崇拜哨兵。

1891
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,110
There's got to be
a better way
to bring him down.

1892
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,110
一定有更好的办法扳倒他。

1893
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,810
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

1894
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,810
我们必须相信每个人都会相信我们展示给他们的东西。

1895
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,920
I trusted Sentinel!

1896
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,920
我信任哨兵！

1897
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,610
With everything.

1898
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,610
与一切。

1899
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:22,090
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

1900
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:22,090
我再也不会相信所谓的领袖了。

1901
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,420
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

1902
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,420
我只知道我能信任一个人

1903
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,270
All right,
wake them up.

1904
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,270
好吧，把他们叫醒。

1905
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,460
Now, are you spies

1906
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,460
你们是间谍吗

1907
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,770
or just incompetent lackeys?

1908
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,770
或者只是不称职的走狗？

1909
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,600
We're not spies.
But he is incompetent.

1910
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,600
我们不是间谍。但他无能。

1911
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,950
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

1912
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,950
扫描电脉冲。他说的是真话。

1913
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,510
That just means
he believes himself,
like any spy would.

1914
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,510
这只能说明他相信自己，就像其他间谍一样。

1915
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,050
Uh, why is he gagged?

1916
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,050
他为什么被堵住了嘴？

1917
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,750
He wouldn't stop talking.

1918
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,750
他不停地说话。

1919
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,290
Even when he was
unconscious?

1920
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,290
即使在他失去知觉的时候？

1921
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,520
Especially when
he was unconscious!

1922
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,520
尤其是当他失去知觉的时候！

1923
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,760
Enough!

1924
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,760
够了!

1925
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,360
Two options for you!

1926
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,360
你有两个选择！

1927
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,070
One, we slowly
dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

1928
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,070
第一，我们慢慢地拆下你们每个人一个螺栓一个螺钉，

1929
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:42,730
and really make sure
you feel it.

1930
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:42,730
一定要感觉到。

1931
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,870
Or two:

1932
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,870
两个:

1933
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,670
In exchange
for a quick death,

1934
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,670
为了让我死得痛快

1935
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,110
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

1936
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,110
你给我们能量列车的情报，

1937
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:50,110
access to the mines

1938
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:50,110
进入矿井

1939
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:53,820
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

1940
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:53,820
或者任何可能伤害你上司的事，哨兵擎天柱。

1941
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,350
Who exactly are you guys?

1942
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,350
你们到底是谁？

1943
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:58,120
Ah!

1944
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:58,120
啊!

1945
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,190
The Cybertronian High Guard!

1946
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,190
塞伯坦最高卫队！

1947
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,090
I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

1948
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,090
我就说不够紧吧！

1949
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,230
Prestigious defenders
of Iacon.
Prestigious?

1950
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,230
著名的伊肯的捍卫者。著名的?

1951
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:08,960
He's right.
I read all about you
in the archives.

1952
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:08,960
他是对的。我在档案里看到了你的一切。

1953
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,400
You were
the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

1954
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,400
你们是塞伯坦最具传奇色彩的战士。

1955
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,200
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

1956
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,200
看，看，看！红蜘蛛,

1957
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,100
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

1958
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,100
你们是冲击波和声波。

1959
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,730
Raise your hand
if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

1960
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,730
如果你的名字里有“wave”，请举手。有很多“波浪”。

1961
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,310
Silence!

1962
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,310
安静!

1963
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:23,440
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

1964
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:23,440
黄色烦人的那个是对的。

1965
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
Whoo!

1966
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
哇!

1967
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,280
We were once the High Guard.

1968
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,280
我们曾经是最高卫队。

1969
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,020
We witnessed
Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

1970
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,020
我们目睹了哨兵的背叛，擎天柱的陨落。

1971
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,920
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

1972
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,920
从那天起，我们一直在暗地里战斗，

1973
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,650
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

1974
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,650
尽我们所能破坏哨兵。

1975
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,390
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1976
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,390
太好了!我们——等等，等等。

1977
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,100
Okay, okay.
We're good.
Everyone relax.

1978
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,100
好吧,好吧。我们很好。每个人都放松。

1979
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,590
I'm just saying we're allies.

1980
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,590
我只是说我们是盟友。

1981
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,660
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

1982
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,660
我们在回艾肯的路上，

1983
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,730
and now with your help,
we can unify Cybertron
against Sentinel Prime.

1984
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,730
现在有了你的帮助，我们可以联合塞伯坦对抗哨兵擎天柱。

1985
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:53,880
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

1986
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:53,880
统一的塞伯坦只是个神话。

1987
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,740
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

1988
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,740
最重要的是一个机器人比另一个机器人强！

1989
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:03,610
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

1990
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:03,610
好吧。所以，这些家伙有点紧张。

1991
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,550
Yeah. Just a little.

1992
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,550
是的。只会一点点。

1993
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,920
Hey!

1994
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,920
嘿!

1995
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,490
What are you doing?

1996
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,490
你在干什么？

1997
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,720
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

1998
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,720
我告诉你我不会做什么。

1999
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,660
I'm not cowering
in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

2000
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,660
我才不要躲在破船里，扮演国王的角色。

2001
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,860
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

2002
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,860
我没有假装我能改变什么

2003
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,600
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

2004
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,600
打了一拳，然后跑开躲起来！

2005
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,860
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

2006
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,860
我今天发现哨兵酒吧烂透了，

2007
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,870
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

2008
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,870
我要让他为此付出代价

2009
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,370
Today!

2010
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,370
今天!

2011
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:31,980
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

2012
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:31,980
你以为你侮辱了我就能离开吗？

2013
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,020
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

2014
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,020
没有我的命令，谁也不许离开。

2015
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,680
Is that right?

2016
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,680
对吗？

2017
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,850
Well, how can you say so

2018
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,850
你怎么能这么说呢

2019
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,820
with my head in your teeth?

2020
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,820
把我的头塞进你的嘴里？

2021
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,490
D!

2022
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,490
D !

2023
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,430
Whoa!

2024
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,430
哇!

2025
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,900
Hit me!

2026
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,900
打我!

2027
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,180
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!

2028
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,180
做到!来吧!是的,更多!

2029
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,710
D-16! D-16! D-16!

2030
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,710
D-16 !D-16 !D-16 !

2031
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:12,880
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

2032
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:12,880
你想看看一个机器人比另一个机器人强吗？嗯?

2033
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,960
Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

2034
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,960
这就是你的全部能耐吗，硬汉？

2035
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,750
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

2036
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,750
我们走吧!做到!来吧!

2037
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,480
Please! I beg you!

2038
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,480
拜托!我求你了！

2039
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,310
Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

2040
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,310
停!D，他不是敌人！

2041
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,780
Bear witness!

2042
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,780
见证!

2043
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,580
This is the last time
I show mercy!

2044
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,580
这是我最后一次仁慈！

2045
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,260
Decide right now:

2046
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,260
现在就决定：

2047
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:54,890
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before
your pathetic leader,

2048
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:54,890
你可以躲在这里，向你可怜的领导鞠躬，

2049
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:58,230
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

2050
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:58,230
或者跟随我向伊肯进军

2051
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:01,800
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

2052
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:01,800
我要彻底干掉哨兵！

2053
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:08,870
D-16! D-16! D-16!

2054
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:08,870
D-16 !D-16 !D-16 !

2055
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,960
B, come on!

2056
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,960
B，别这样！

2057
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,760
Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

2058
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,760
攻击所有敌人！我找到桥了！

2059
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:37,430
Elita, get down!

2060
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:37,430
艾丽塔，趴下！

2061
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:02,690
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

2062
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:02,690
我感觉就像有人把悬崖砸在我身上。

2063
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:05,230
Where are the others?

2064
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:05,230
其他人呢？

2065
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,020
Sentinel's troops
took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

2066
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,020
哨兵部队尽可能多地俘虏了他们的俘虏。

2067
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,830
They got D-16 and B.

2068
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,830
他们有D-16和B。

2069
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:12,700
Oh, no.

2070
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:12,700
哦,不。

2071
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,270
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

2072
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,270
还有一半的高警备队疯子。

2073
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,000
Our proof.

2074
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,000
我们的证据。

2075
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,440
It's gone.

2076
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,440
这是一去不复返了。

2077
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,580
So, what do we do now?

2078
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,580
那么，我们现在该怎么办？

2079
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,180
D was right.

2080
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,180
D是对的。

2081
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,780
About what?
Everything.

2082
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,780
关于什么?一切。

2083
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:31,420
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

2084
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:31,420
看看它。环顾四周。这是一场灾难。

2085
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,160
It's all my fault.

2086
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,160
都是我的错。

2087
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,080
I should have
stayed on protocol.

2088
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,080
我应该按规定办事的。

2089
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,760
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

2090
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,760
听我说。我真的想让你听听。

2091
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,830
Are you listening?

2092
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,830
你在听吗？

2093
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,830
I'm better than you.

2094
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,830
我比你强。

2095
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,470
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

2096
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,470
好吧，我听到了。

2097
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,100
I'm better than you
in every way,

2098
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,100
我各方面都比你强，

2099
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,610
except you have hope.

2100
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,610
除了你还有希望。

2101
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:01,320
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

2102
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:01,320
你一直都是。你回矿井去救爵士了。

2103
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,290
You snuck up
to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

2104
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,290
你潜到地表去找领导矩阵。

2105
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,110
Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

2106
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,110
是啊，那结果如何？

2107
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,880
My point is,

2108
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,880
我的观点是，

2109
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,150
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

2110
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,150
你的直觉告诉你打破常规是有原因的。

2111
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:16,270
This blind optimism
that you have

2112
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:16,270
你这种盲目的乐观

2113
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:20,630
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

2114
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:20,630
所以你才会做出如此大胆勇敢的选择，

2115
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,500
that are also extremely stupid.

2116
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,500
这也是非常愚蠢的。

2117
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,070
First time
giving a pep talk?

2118
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,070
第一次给人打气？

2119
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,840
You're inspiring.

2120
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,840
你是鼓舞人心的。

2121
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,210
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

2122
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,210
你可以设想一个别人看不到的更美好的未来。

2123
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,320
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

2124
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,320
如果我们还想再见到B和D-16，

2125
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,350
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

2126
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,350
这就是我们现在需要的猎户座和平。

2127
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,590
Listen to me.

2128
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,590
听我说。

2129
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,690
We can do this.

2130
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,690
我们可以做到。

2131
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:49,360
Those Energon trains
will be heading
back to Iacon.

2132
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:49,360
那些能量列车会回艾肯的。

2133
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,090
If we intercepted one--

2134
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,090
如果我们拦截一个

2135
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:55,300
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

2136
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:55,300
当然可以，我可以改道。我们还需要什么？

2137
01:09:55,300 --> 01:10:00,030
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

2138
01:09:55,300 --> 01:10:00,030
我的直觉告诉我，我们得找些疯子。

2139
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:04,380
I was afraid
you'd say that.

2140
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:04,380
我就怕你会这么说。

2141
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,980
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

2142
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,980
冲击波，声波。你在后面。

2143
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,250
In order to save
our captured friends,
we have to act now.

2144
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,250
为了救被俘的朋友，我们必须马上行动。

2145
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,550
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

2146
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,550
我把你炸回艾康怎么样？

2147
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,990
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

2148
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,990
哦!她一拳打在我眼睛上！

2149
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,230
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

2150
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,230
大家都闭嘴！你们所有人。听他说。

2151
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,060
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

2152
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,060
很可能是我们的朋友被俘虏了

2153
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,730
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

2154
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,730
在哨兵的塔顶

2155
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,770
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

2156
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,770
突然袭击会给我们一个营救他们的机会。

2157
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:33,740
Impossible. We do not
have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

2158
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:33,740
不可能的。我们没有足够的士兵，也没有办法进去。

2159
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,910
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

2160
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,910
伊莉塔会带我们进去的。我还会调集更多的军队。

2161
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,550
Why should we follow you?

2162
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,550
我们为什么要跟着你？

2163
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,380
We will follow you.

2164
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,380
我们会跟着你。

2165
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,620
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

2166
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,620
注意，高卫。准备战斗。

2167
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,650
What is our first move?

2168
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,650
我们的第一步是什么？

2169
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:47,820
We roll out.

2170
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:47,820
我们推出。

2171
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:50,430
What?

2172
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:50,430
怎么啦？

2173
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:51,860
Louder.

2174
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:51,860
响亮。

2175
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,300
Transform and roll out!

2176
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,300
变换并推出！

2177
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,840
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

2178
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,840
我不明白。为什么我们还活着？

2179
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,450
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

2180
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,450
看看这群吵吵闹闹的人！高级守卫！

2181
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:13,320
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

2182
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:13,320
知道吗，你们好难找啊。

2183
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,910
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

2184
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,910
每次到地表，我都在寻找你。

2185
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,450
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

2186
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,450
追踪洞穴里的机器人让我找到了他们。

2187
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:20,790
Oh-ho-ho!

2188
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:20,790
Oh-ho-ho !

2189
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,720
You captured Starscream!
It was too easy.

2190
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,720
你抓住了红蜘蛛！这太容易了。

2191
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,920
I'm going to rip you apart
piece by piece

2192
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,920
我要把你撕成碎片

2193
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,430
so that your death
is painful!

2194
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,430
所以你的死是痛苦的！

2195
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:28,730
You'll regret
the day you were--

2196
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:28,730
你会后悔的

2197
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,700
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

2198
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,700
你听起来很可笑。这很奇怪。

2199
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,730
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

2200
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,730
D-16，你会是一个多么悲惨的故事。

2201
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:37,640
Atop the leaderboard
in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

2202
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:37,640
在你的领域名列前茅，暗地里却成了叛徒。

2203
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,740
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

2204
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,740
我不是叛徒。你是叛徒。

2205
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,480
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

2206
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,480
Nuh-uh。你们，你们所有人，都是叛徒。

2207
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,170
You've been working
with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

2208
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,170
你一直在和Quintessons合作破坏我的探险。

2209
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,620
You're the reason
why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

2210
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,620
你就是我还没找到领导力矩阵的原因。

2211
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,910
None of that is true!

2212
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,910
这些都不是真的！

2213
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,520
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

2214
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,520
相信我，这是真的

2215
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,460
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

2216
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,460
当我在全体艾肯人面前处决你的时候

2217
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,280
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

2218
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,280
因为在这里，真相是我创造的。

2219
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,440
Well, well.
What's this about?

2220
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,440
嗯,很好。这是怎么回事？

2221
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,000
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

2222
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,000
我不会跪在你面前。

2223
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,970
Feeling confident, are we?

2224
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,970
感觉很自信，是吗？

2225
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:18,210
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

2226
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:18,210
你吓不倒我。你想知道为什么吗？

2227
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,310
Please.

2228
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,310
请。

2229
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,550
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

2230
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,550
因为我已经没什么可失去的了。

2231
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,720
You took it all.

2232
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,720
你全拿走了。

2233
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,460
I sure did.

2234
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,460
当然了。

2235
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,920
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

2236
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,920
啊，威震天王。

2237
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,400
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was
the coolest Prime!

2238
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,400
你当然是粉丝了。威震天是最酷的擎天柱！

2239
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,290
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

2240
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,290
最大的!最坏的!最艰难的!

2241
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,770
That's why,
after I killed him,

2242
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,770
所以我杀了他之后，

2243
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,040
I took his cog for myself.

2244
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,040
我把他的齿轮夺去了。

2245
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,550
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

2246
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,550
他比你伟大得多！

2247
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,840
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

2248
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,840
我不知道。我很好。

2249
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,720
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

2250
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,720
但我能理解你为什么想用他的脸来代替我。

2251
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,780
Here.

2252
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,780
在这里。

2253
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,250
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

2254
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,250
我们要确保它不会脱落。

2255
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,540
Okay.

2256
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,540
好吧。

2257
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,110
I can do this.

2258
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,110
我能做到。

2259
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,260
You can't be serious.
We just worked
22 shifts without a break!

2260
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,260
你不是认真的吧。我们连续干了22个班！

2261
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,990
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

2262
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,990
这些矿工需要休息和时间来修复和

2263
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,290
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

2264
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,290
哨兵质点需要更多能量。

2265
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:49,740
So get back in the mines
before I make you
get back in the--

2266
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:49,740
所以在我让你回矿井之前赶紧回去

2267
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,400
Who was that?
Did you see
who that was?

2268
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,400
那是谁？你看到那是谁了吗？

2269
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,610
That can't be him.

2270
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,610
不可能是他。

2271
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,710
Is that...

2272
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,710
是……

2273
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,410
It can't be.

2274
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,410
这不可能。

2275
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,950
Orion?
Jazz.

2276
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,950
猎户星座吗?爵士乐。

2277
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,380
Is it really you?

2278
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,380
真的是你吗？

2279
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,790
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

2280
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,790
是啊，我知道我看起来有点不一样了。

2281
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,380
"Little"?

2282
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,380
“小”?

2283
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,220
There's nothing
"little" about you.

2284
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,220
你一点都不“小”。

2285
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,090
Uh, how is this possible?

2286
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,090
这怎么可能？

2287
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:16,930
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

2288
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:16,930
哨兵告诉我们你死于种族伤害。

2289
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,900
Sentinel is a liar.

2290
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,900
哨兵是个骗子。

2291
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,930
What?
Huh?

2292
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,930
怎么啦？嗯?

2293
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:24,100
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

2294
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:24,100
听着，我知道这听起来像是我说的。

2295
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,610
I was never
the most focused miner.

2296
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,610
我从来都不是最专注的矿工。

2297
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,070
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

2298
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,070
但正如你所见，现在一切都不同了。

2299
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,150
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

2300
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,150
我来到水面，了解了真相。

2301
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,290
My friends,

2302
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,290
我的朋友,

2303
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:49,390
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

2304
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:49,390
我们生来就有变形的齿轮。

2305
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,600
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

2306
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,600
然后哨兵，他从我们这里偷走了它们。

2307
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,000
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

2308
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,000
他剥夺了我们自己做决定的能力。

2309
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,170
He stole our freedom.

2310
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,170
他偷走了我们的自由。

2311
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:08,820
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

2312
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:08,820
但现在，我给你第一个真正的选择。

2313
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,950
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

2314
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,950
你可以上第23班，把自己挖死

2315
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,480
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

2316
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,480
或者和我一起对抗哨兵

2317
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,160
Right now.

2318
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,160
现在。

2319
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,530
How are we supposed to do that?
We can't fight.
We don't have cogs.

2320
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,530
我们该怎么做呢？我们不能战斗。我们没有齿轮。

2321
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:29,800
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

2322
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:29,800
定义变形金刚的不是它胸前的齿轮

2323
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,770
but the spark
that resides in their core.

2324
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,770
而是他们内心深处的火花。

2325
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,940
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

2326
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,940
给你意志让你的世界变得更美好的火花。

2327
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,810
And that spark,
Sentinel can never
take from us.

2328
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,810
而那火花，哨兵永远无法从我们这里夺走。

2329
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:43,210
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

2330
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:43,210
我们的人不够多。我们需要一支军队。

2331
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,990
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

2332
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,990
我们有一个。伊莉塔正在带军队来。

2333
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,050
We are not alone in this.

2334
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,050
我们并不孤单。

2335
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:51,860
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

2336
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:51,860
如果我们想掌握自己的命运，

2337
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,520
we will have to
fight for it.

2338
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,520
我们必须为此而战。

2339
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,900
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

2340
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,900
现在是我们站起来的时候了……

2341
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,900
...for ourselves.

2342
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,900
…为我们自己。

2343
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:03,170
Stand up for this injustice.

2344
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:03,170
为这种不公正挺身而出。

2345
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:09,070
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

2346
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:09,070
我向你保证这场战斗是值得的。

2347
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,750
Follow me.

2348
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,750
跟我来。

2349
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,650
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

2350
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,650
当我们站在一起时，没有什么能阻止我们。

2351
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:18,180
Together as one.

2352
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:18,180
合为一体。

2353
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:22,690
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

2354
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:22,690
猎户座罗马帝国!猎户座罗马帝国!猎户座罗马帝国!

2355
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,190
<i>Elita, it's time.</i><i></i>

2356
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,190
<i>Elita，时间到了。</i><i></i>

2357
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,520
You got it.

2358
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,520
你说对了。

2359
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,800
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

2360
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,800
系好安全带，Blinky。我们要进去了。

2361
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,440
Not a good idea.

2362
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,440
这不是个好主意。

2363
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:47,780
D, stay down.

2364
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:47,780
D，趴下。

2365
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,420
Well, that's a shame.

2366
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,420
哦，那太遗憾了。

2367
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,390
You really were
a great miner.

2368
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,390
你真是个了不起的矿工。

2369
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,330
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

2370
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,330
有人入侵了！保护哨兵!

2371
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:22,150
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

2372
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:22,150
他们发现了我们。要开始颠簸了。

2373
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,790
High Guard, eject.

2374
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,790
高卫，弹射。

2375
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,760
Come on! Move out!

2376
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,760
来吧!搬出去!

2377
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,770
There's too many.
We have to abort!

2378
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,770
太多了。我们必须中止行动！

2379
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,470
We're not gonna make it.

2380
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,470
我们撑不过去了。

2381
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,310
Whoo-hoo!

2382
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,310
Whoo-hoo !

2383
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:55,920
Metal to the pedal, miners!

2384
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:55,920
开足马力，矿工们！

2385
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,680
Let's break some protocol!

2386
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,680
让我们打破一些规则吧！

2387
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,450
That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

2388
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,450
我说的就是这个，帕克斯！

2389
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,360
Whoa! That's intense.

2390
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,360
哇!这是强烈的。

2391
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,070
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

2392
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,070
你赢不了的，矿工。我什么都看见了！

2393
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,970
That's right, you do.

2394
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,970
没错，你有。

2395
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,710
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

2396
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,710
除了我们即将撞上的那座塔。

2397
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,350
What's going on?

2398
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,350
这是怎么呢？

2399
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,730
Hey!

2400
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,730
嘿!

2401
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,000
What has he done to you?

2402
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,000
他对你做了什么？

2403
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,870
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

2404
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,870
这跟我要对哨兵做的事比起来根本不算什么。

2405
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:55,070
Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

2406
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:55,070
声波，释放囚犯。

2407
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:02,080
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

2408
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:02,080
我知道怎么阻止他。Airachnid就是答案。

2409
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,850
I'm doing this my way.
D!

2410
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,850
我要按我的方式来。D !

2411
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,420
Yes!

2412
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,420
是的!

2413
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,490
Whoa!

2414
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,490
哇!

2415
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,030
Whoa-ho-ho!

2416
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:13,030
Whoa-ho-ho !

2417
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,390
I got a battle mask!

2418
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,390
我有一个战斗面具！

2419
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,060
Elita! Battle mask!

2420
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,060
Elita !战斗面具!

2421
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:21,030
It appeared
when this guy tried to--

2422
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:21,030
当这个人试图

2423
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:23,070
Knife hands?
I have knife hands!

2424
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:23,070
刀手?我的手像刀一样！

2425
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:27,140
What the--?

2426
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:27,140
——什么?

2427
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,950
Badassatron.

2428
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,950
Badassatron。

2429
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,150
Where's Sentinel?

2430
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,150
哨兵在哪儿?

2431
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,960
You pathetic little twits.

2432
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,960
你们这些可怜的小笨蛋。

2433
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:48,290
Did you really think
that you could knock down
everything I've built?

2434
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:48,290
你真以为你能把我建造的一切都推倒吗？

2435
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:52,130
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.
What truth?

2436
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:52,130
结束了，哨兵。你无法逃避真相。什么真理?

2437
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,840
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

2438
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,840
我从你刚出生的胸膛里取出了螺丝钉？

2439
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,040
Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off
the Quintessons

2440
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,040
逼你做我的，这样我就可以付钱给Quintessons了

2441
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,400
and live like a king?

2442
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,400
像国王一样生活？

2443
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,400
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

2444
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,400
这些都不重要！因为真相……

2445
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,410
...is what I make it.

2446
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,410
…是我做的。

2447
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:08,510
Incoming!

2448
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:08,510
传入的!

2449
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,680
Whoa!

2450
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,680
哇!

2451
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:17,090
He's too strong.
I have a plan.

2452
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:17,090
他太强壮了。我有个计划。

2453
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:19,290
We need Airachnid.
Airachnid?

2454
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:19,290
我们需要Airachnid。Airachnid吗?

2455
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:21,560
We need her memory.
Where is she?

2456
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:21,560
我们需要她的记忆。她在哪里？

2457
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,160
Found her!

2458
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,160
发现她!

2459
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:25,660
Elita!

2460
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:25,660
Elita !

2461
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,940
<i>Do not break her.</i><i></i>

2462
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,940
<i>不要打断她。</i><i></i>

2463
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,270
<i>Bring her
to the broadcast station.</i><i></i>

2464
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,270
<i>带她去广播站。</i><i></i>

2465
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:30,500
<i>We'll meet you there.</i><i></i>

2466
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:30,500
<i>我们在那儿见。</i><i></i>

2467
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,470
Easier said than done.

2468
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,470
说起来容易做起来难。

2469
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,790
<i>I said,
don't break her!</i><i></i>

2470
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,790
我说了，别伤害她！< / i >

2471
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,820
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

2472
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,820
放松点!我已经很温柔了。

2473
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,000
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

2474
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,000
猎户!猎户座,看!我的手像刀一样！

2475
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,600
I can see that.

2476
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,600
我看得出来。

2477
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,800
I'm gonna cut these guys.
Watch. Come here!

2478
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,800
我要切掉这些家伙。手表。来这里!

2479
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,670
You can jab them later.
We got to go.

2480
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,670
你可以稍后再打。我们得走了。

2481
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,050
Yeah!

2482
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,050
是啊!

2483
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,560
Uh, excuse me.
You can't be in here.

2484
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,560
呃，打扰一下。你不能在这里。

2485
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,510
B!

2486
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,510
B !

2487
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:46,340
These are not
the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?

2488
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:46,340
他们不是坏人。你为什么要剪门？

2489
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,980
What? No, I didn't--
That was an-- I--

2490
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,980
怎么啦？不，我没有，那是，我

2491
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,610
It was already like that.
Right?

2492
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,610
已经是那样了。对吧?

2493
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:51,950
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

2494
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:51,950
是的，没错。没错，是的。

Yes. Mm-hmm.

不，不，不。为什么?

2581
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,860
Why did you do that? Why?

2582
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,860
你为什么要那样做？为什么?

2583
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,970
D, no.

2584
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,970
D,没有。

2585
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:13,520
I'm done saving you.

2586
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:13,520

Follow me and you will
never again be deceived.

2592
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:03,090
跟着我，你就不会再受骗了。

2593
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,430
Rise up!

2594
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,430

2601
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:17,200
<i>your noble sacrifice
for the greater good</i><i></i>

2602
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:17,200
<i>你为更大的利益做出了崇高的牺牲</i><i></i>

2603
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,250
<i>has proven you worthy
in the eyes of Primus.</i><i></i>

2604
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,250
<i>已经在普里默斯的眼中证明了你的价值。</i><i></i>

2605
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,520
<i>He entrusts in you</i><i></i>

2606
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,520
<i>他信任你</i><i></i>

2607
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,420
the future of Cybertron

2608
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,420
塞伯坦的未来

2609
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:33,050
and the Matrix of Leadership!

2610
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:33,050
以及《领导力矩阵》！

2611
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,660
I will lead us all
into the future!

2612
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,660
我将带领大家走向未来！

2613
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,750
I...

2614
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,750
我…

2615
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,580
am...

2616
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,580
我…

2617
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:00,290
Megatron!

2618
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:00,290
威震天!

2619
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,920
<i>Arise...</i><i></i>

2620
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,920
<我>出现…< / i >

2621
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:06,050
<i>Optimus Prime.</i><i></i>

2622

<我>擎天柱。< / i >

2623
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,930
Burn it down!

2624
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,930
烧了它！

2625
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,930
All of it!

2626
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,930
全部！

2627
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:21,510
All hail Megatron!

2628
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:21,510
威震天万岁！

2629
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:25,910
He's gonna kill everyone.
We have to stop him.
Come on.

2630
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:25,910
他会杀了所有人。我们必须阻止他。来吧。

2631
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:29,110
Stop! It's over.

2632
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:29,110
停!这是结束了。

2633
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:32,880
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

2634
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:32,880
当他的所有追随者都死了，一切就结束了！

2635
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,820
Impossible.

2636
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,820
不可能的。

2637
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:14,350
Primus gave you the Matrix.

2638
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:14,350
普里默斯给了你母体。

2639
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:16,560
We could've built
the future together.

2640
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:16,560
我们本可以一起创造未来。

2641
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,600
I'll build it myself.

2642
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,600
我自己来做。

2643
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,200
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

2644
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,200
等我把挡道的人都打倒了！

2645
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:04,810
Ah!

2646
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:04,810
啊!

2647
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:10,140
We were given the power
to change our world

2648
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:10,140
我们被赋予了改变世界的力量

2649
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,650
and you chose to destroy it.

2650
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,650
而你却选择了毁灭它。

2651
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,110
Just like Sentinel.

2652
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,110
就像哨兵一样。

2653
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:17,980
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

2654
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:17,980
你背叛了塞伯坦和它的公民。

2655
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,450
And you betrayed me.

2656
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,450
你背叛了我。

2657
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,600
Go.

2658
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,600
走了。

2659
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,130
Take the High Guard
and leave.

2660
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,130
带上高卫队离开。

2661
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:42,970
You are banished from Iacon.

2662
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:42,970
你被驱逐出艾肯。

2663
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:50,180
It didn't have to end
this way.

2664
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:50,180
事情本不必这样结束的。

2665
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:55,990
This isn't over, Prime.

2666
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:55,990
这还没完，擎天柱。

2667
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:05,900
High Guard, follow me!

2668
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:05,900
高卫兵，跟我来！

2669
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:22,050
<i>The line
between friend and enemy</i><i></i>

2670
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:22,050
<i>敌友分界</i><i></i>

2671
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,210
<i>is not as clear
as I once believed.</i><i></i>

2672
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,210
<i>不像我曾经认为的那样清晰。</i><i></i>

2673
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:29,150
<i>Once it's crossed,
there's no going back.</i><i></i>

2674
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:29,150
<i>一旦越过，就没有回头路了</i><i></i>

2675
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:33,190
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i><i></i>

2676
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:33,190
<i>因为有些转换是永久的</i><i></i>

2677
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,060
Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

2678
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,060
嘿，威震天王。好。

2679
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:37,230
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

2680
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:37,230
哦,是的。他是我的英雄。

2681
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:39,060
The greatest Prime
to ever live.

2682
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:39,060
有史以来最伟大的擎天柱。

2683
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,560
I'm D-16.
Orion Pax.

2684
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,560
我D-16。猎户座Pax。

2685
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,970
You ever mine Energon before?

2686
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,970
你以前开采过能源吗？

2687
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,370
No. You?

2688
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,370
不。你吗?

2689
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:49,580
No. I hear it's dangerous.

2690
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:49,580
不。我听说这很危险。

2691
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,680
Well, I'll tell you what.

2692
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,680
好吧，我告诉你。

2693
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:54,210
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

2694
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:54,210
你看着我，我保证也看着你。

2695
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,410
All right.

2696
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,410
好吧。

2697
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,250
Thanks, Pax.

2698
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,250
谢谢,Pax。

2699
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,590
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

2700
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,590
塞伯坦的新开始。

2701
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,700
And a new leader.

2702
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,700
还有一个新的领导人。

2703
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,710
Yes, about that.

2704
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,710
是的，关于那个。

2705
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,710
I could use some help
from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

2706
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,710
我可以从一个各方面都比我强的机器人那里得到一些帮助。

2707
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,680
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

2708
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,680
谁,我吗?哦，不，不。

2709
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,080
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

2710
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,080
我在垃圾管理部门有份不错的工作。

2711
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,080
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

2712
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,080
队长，我欠你一次升职。

2713
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,850
How's Major Elita sound?

2714
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,850
埃莉塔少校还好吗？

2715
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:35,420
How about Commander?

2716
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:35,420
指挥官呢？

2717
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,380
Even better.

2718
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,380
那就更好了。

2719
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:41,360
And I'm sorry, B,
but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

2720
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:41,360
我很抱歉，B，但我不能让你回到50层。

2721
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,190
I may be a Prime now,

2722
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,190
我现在可能是Prime会员了

2723
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:44,930
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

2724
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:44,930
但我需要你在我身边

2725
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:48,430
Are you serious?
This is the greatest
day of my life.

2726
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:48,430
你是认真的吗？这是我一生中最棒的一天。

2727
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,630
I get to work
for the government.

2728
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,630
我为政府工作。

2729
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:54,270
Okay. So that's new.

2730
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:54,270
好吧。这是新的。

2731
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,940
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

2732
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,940
不好意思，发生什么事了？

2733
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:30,110
<i>And now we stand here
together as one...</i><i></i>

2734
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:30,110
<i>现在我们站在一起作为一个人…</i><i></i>

2735
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:35,640
<i>proving we all have
the power to transform,</i><i></i>

2736
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:35,640
<i>证明我们都有改变的能力，</i><i></i>

2737
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,890
<i>to become
who we were destined to be,</i><i></i>

2738
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,890
<i>成为我们注定要成为的人，</i><i></i>

2739
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:43,580
<i>to right wrongs,
to make our world better.</i><i></i>

2740
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:43,580
<i>去纠正错误，让我们的世界更美好。</i><i></i>

2741
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:46,760
<i>Because here,
freedom and autonomy</i><i></i>

2742
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:46,760
<i>因为这里，自由和自治</i><i></i>

2743
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,490
<i>are the rights
of all sentient beings.</i><i></i>

2744
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,490
<i>是一切有情众生的权利。</i><i></i>

2745
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:55,070
<i>Here,
all are truly Autobots.</i><i></i>

2746
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:55,070
<i>在这里，所有人都是真正的汽车人。</i><i></i>

2747
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:00,140
<i>This message is a warning
to all Quintessons.</i><i></i>

2748
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:00,140
<i>此消息是对所有Quintessons的警告。</i><i></i>

2749
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:05,540
<i>If you dare
return to Cybertron,
the Autobots will be waiting.</i><i></i>

2750
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:05,540
<i>如果你敢回到塞伯坦，汽车人会等着你的。</i><i></i>

2751
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,480
<i>I will be waiting.</i><i></i>

2752
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,480
<i>我等你。</i><i></i>

2753
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,310
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i><i></i>

2754
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,310
<i>我是擎天柱</i><i></i>

2755
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,670
Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

2756
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,670
嘿,伙计们!好消息，能量号回来了！

2757
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,950
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

2758
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,950
我有一个齿轮，我可以变形！

2759
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,890
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

2760
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,890
说来话长。我以后再告诉你。

2761
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:50,450
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

2762
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:50,450
哦!这是最棒的部分。我的手是直刀。

2763
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:52,290
Watch this. Knife hands!

2764
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:52,290
看这个。刀手!

2765
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,230
No!

2766
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,230
不!

2767
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:23,970
<i>Sentinel the betrayer is dead.</i><i></i>

2768
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:23,970
<i>哨兵：背叛者已死。</i><i></i>

2769
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:27,710
<i>But his death has given life
to a new enemy.</i><i></i>

2770
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:27,710
<i>但是他的死给了一个新的敌人生命。</i><i></i>

2771
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:29,910
<i>A stronger enemy.</i><i></i>
