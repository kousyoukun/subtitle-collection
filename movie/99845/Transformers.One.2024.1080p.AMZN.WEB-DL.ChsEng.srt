1
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,470
好吧 让我看看这里有什么
Okay, let's see what we got here.

2
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,400
看过了 都看过了
Seen it. Seen it.

3
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,700
这是什么
Huh. What's this about?

4
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,570
在混沌 混沌 混沌
At the dawn... dawn... dawn...

5
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,930
混沌 混沌
dawn... dawn... dawn...

6
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,950
这就对了
Ah. Here we go.

7
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,590
混沌之初
At the dawn of time,

8
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,160
混沌之初 有位仁慈且强大的造物主
there was our gracious and powerful creator,

9
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,860
元始天尊
Primus.

10
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,060
他为了保护我们的宇宙 献出了自己的生命
To protect our universe, he sacrificed his life force,

11
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,870
将自己变成了我们的星球
transforming himself into our planet,

12
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,640
塞伯坦
Cybertron.

13
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,410
从塞伯坦的核心
From within Cybertron's core,

14
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,970
元始天尊创造出了创造了最初的变形机械生命体
Primus birthed the first Transformers

15
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,290
元祖金刚
known as the Primes,

16
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,350
最强大的十三使徒金刚
the most powerful Transformers,

17
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,230
肩负着领导和保护赛博坦未来的职责
appointed to lead and protect future generations.

18
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,960
为了帮助他们 元始天尊创造出了
To assist them, Primus created an entity of great power,

19
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,160
领导模块
the Matrix of Leadership.

20
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,160
领导模块 就是这个 好 继续说
The Matrix, there it is. Okay. Good. Come on. Keep going.

21
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,830
在领导模块加持下
With the Matrix in the Primes' possession,

22
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:17,340
赛博坦的自然能源像泉涌般运转起来
Cybertron's natural power source, Energon, flowed in abundance,

23
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,710
成为星球的生命之源
sustaining life across the planet.

24
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,350
注意 检测到存在未经授权生命体在档案库移动
Attention! Unauthorized movement detected in archival vault.

25
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,650
J-3区域
Sector J-3.

26
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,720
KDQ-12至KDK-1区域
KDQ-12 to KDK-1.

27
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
十秒内到达档案库
Breaching archives in ten seconds.

28
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,400
世代以来 星球平静祥和 生生不息
For generations, there was peace and prosperity,

29
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,830
直到领导模块消失不见
until the Matrix of Leadership was lost,

30
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,540
导致能量晶体无法继续运转
causing Energon to no longer flow.

31
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,700
为什么每个关于领导模块的传说都只说到这里
Why does every legend about the Matrix end right there?

32
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,970
我就不信找不到后面的内容
One of these has to say what happened.

33
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,240
站住 罪犯 即将执行扣押
Halt, criminal! Prepare to be detained!

34
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,380
站住 罪犯 即将执行……
Oh, hey there. Halt, criminal! Prepare to...

35
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,080
不许动 趴下
Freeze! Get down!

36
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,650
好吧 伙计们 很高兴在这里遇到你们
Well, hello, guys. I'm so glad you're here.

37
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,050
出口往哪里走
Which way is the exit?

38
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,590
我一定是走错路了
I must've taken a wrong turn.

39
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,430
是那个有缺陷的矿工 欧利安 屁克斯
It's that defective mining bot, Oreon Pix!

40
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,890
奥利安 派克斯 管他呢?
Orion Pax. Who cares?

41
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,930
我们告诉过你别再来这里
We told you to never come back here!

42
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,900
我们为什么都喜欢大喊大叫 我要撕烂你
Why are we all yelling? I'm gonna smash you!

43
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,570
等等 等等 没必要使用暴力
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, hold on. No need for violence.

44
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,200
你看这样如何 我逃 你们追 我们玩这个游戏如何
How about this: I run away, you chase me. We play that game. Huh?

45
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,240
来吧 你们更大 更快 肯定会很有趣
Come on. You're bigger, faster. It'll be fun.

46
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,070
他没有变形齿轮 让我们给他一个机会
He doesn't have a cog. Let's give him a head start.

47
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,940
就是 反正他也不会变形
Why not? It's not like he can transform.

48
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,910
是吗
Oh, yeah?

49
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,910
好吧 看好这个
Well, watch this.

50
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,080
抓住他
Get him!

51
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,290
会飞的东西 哪里有会飞的东西
Something that flies. Something that flies.

52
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,930
准备执行扣押
Prepare to be detained!

53
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,700
站住 罪犯 准备执行扣押
Halt, criminal! Prepare to be detained!

54
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,130
站住 罪犯
Halt, criminal!

55
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,650
快啊 启动啊 快啊
Come on! Start! Come on!

56
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,690
不 不
Whoa. No, no, no, no!

57
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,460
他在那
There he is!

58
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,160
哈 再见咯 混蛋……
Ha-ha! So long, suck...

59
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,330
能量晶体块
Ooh, Energon.

60
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,140
晚上好 各位 我先失陪了
Evening, everyone. Pardon me.

61
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,360
是奥利安 没搞错 又来
Ah, it's Orion. Seriously, again?

62
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,040
好吧 伙计们 抢先一步啊
Okay, fellas! Thanks for the head start.

63
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
敢不敢再来一轮
You want to give me another one?

64
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,880
-你死定了 -我就当你们不同意
You're dead! I'll take that as a no.

65
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,710
嘿 你们别挡道啊
Hey! Watch where you're going!

66
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,550
你说什么 无齿小辈
Oh... What did you say, no-cog?

67
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,110
对不起 先生 我不是在说你们
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean you.

68
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,980
我指的刚才在你们身后的那个机器人
I was referring to the bot who was behind you.

69
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,490
什么 他人呢
What? Where'd he go?

70
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,950
红蓝色的乞丐机器人
The filthy red and blue bot?

71
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,920
大嘴巴 叭叭叭 破关节 咔咔咔
Has a big mouth, squeaky joints,

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,630
还散发出一股金属腐蚀的恶臭
gives off a corroded metallic stench?

73
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,320
他在哪里 他朝那边跑了
Where is he? He went that way.

74
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,500
我要是抓住那厮
When I get my hands on that bot...

75
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,230
出来吧 都走了
All right, all clear.

76
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,870
好吧 D-16 我可能是有点脏
Okay, D-16, I may be a little rusty,

77
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,550
但说我腐蚀 太过了啊
but "corroded"? That is too far.

78
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,680
让我猜猜 档案馆追过来的
Let me guess. Chased out of the archives?

79
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,750
是的 这次我只能从窗户跳下去了
Yeah. I had to jump out of a window this time.

80
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,550
差点挂了 很疯狂吧
Almost died. It was wild.

81
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,780
找个旧档案 搭上性命啊
And digging through ancient data is worth dying for?

82
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,150
是这样
Yes, it is.

83
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,620
我需要交个新的朋友了
I need a new best friend.

84
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,530
那些历史记录中保存有很多线索
If there are clues in our recorded history

85
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,630
可以帮助我们找到领导模块
that can help locate the Matrix of Leadership,

86
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,020
都在档案馆里
they're in the archives.

87
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,390
御天敌 御天敌
Sentinel Prime, the Sentinel Prime,

88
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,500
现在就在地表
is up on the surface right now,

89
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,740
冒着生命危险 为我们寻找领导模块
risking his life for us in search of the Matrix.

90
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,840
这正是我在做的 我就是想帮他一把
That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm trying to help him.

91
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
好吧
Yeah, okay.

92
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,170
只要能量晶体又开始运转
The sooner Energon flows again,

93
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,340
我们就不用再挖矿了
the sooner we won't have to mine for it.

94
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,680
难道你不想掌握自己的命运 活得自在嘛
Don't you want to choose your own path, do whatever you want?

95
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,340
我们是矿工 我们负责采矿 如是而已
We're miners. We mine, that's all.

96
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,850
不 我敢肯定我还能做更大的事儿 我感觉得到
No, there has got to be something more I can do. I can feel it.

97
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,890
哦 是吗 就像你上次觉得自己
Oh, yeah? Like the time you had a "feeling"

98
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,660
没有变形齿轮也能变形那样
you could transform without a cog?

99
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,450
你说过你不会再提那件事的
You said you were never gonna mention that again.

100
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,890
我花了三天才让你缓过劲来
Took me three days to pry you open.

101
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,030
而你的感觉只会给你带来麻烦
Your feelings get you in trouble.

102
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,570
知道了 知道了
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,800
你只需要相信御天敌 我非常相信他啊
Just trust in Sentinel Prime. I do trust in him.

104
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,460
如果我们真有变形齿轮…
Hey, if we did have cogs...

105
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,740
我会变成一把铁锹 揍你一顿
I'd transform into a shovel and beat you.

106
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,680
我不喜欢你回答得那么直接
I don't like how fast you answered that.

107
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,580
你看 如果你真的揍了我一顿 我不会给你我手里
But listen, if you did beat me, I couldn't give you this awesome.

108
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,850
这张这么酷的震天尊小玩意儿 很酷哦
Megatronus Prime thing I have here. It's cool.

109
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,820
我还是送给别人吧 震天尊什么鬼
I'll give it to someone else. What Megatronus Prime thing?

110
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,690
没什么 就是小小的 你懂的
Ah, it's nothing. Just a, you know,

111
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,990
全新无损初版震天尊贴花而已
mint-condition Megatronus Prime decal, first edition.

112
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,590
啥
What?

113
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,450
如果你不想要 我只好扔掉了
If you don't want it, I can just throw it away.

114
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,060
扔掉 别…别开玩笑 让我看看
Throw it away? Don't... That's not funny. Let me see.

115
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,450
等等 别上手 要把它弄皱的
Wait. Don't grab. You're gonna crease it.

116
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,100
御天敌说震天尊是…
You know, Sentinel says Megatronus was the...

117
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,000
有史以来最强大的领袖
The strongest Prime to ever live.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
我知道 兄弟
I know, buddy.

119
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,680
和你很配 真的好帅
Looks good on you. Ah, it's really cool.

120
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,550
谢谢 永远挺你
Thanks. Always got your back.

121
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,950
无论发生何事
No matter what.

122
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,120
即将到达地下站 请远离车门
Approaching sublevel station. Stand clear of doors.

123
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,050
采矿组 准备卸货
Mining teams, prepare to unload.

124
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,540
油门到底 钻头组 开工吧
Metal to the pedal, drill bits. This is it.

125
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,010
在我的领导下 你们开采了多少能量晶体
How much Energon have you mined under my leadership?

126
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,340
数不胜数 艾丽塔
So much, Elita-1!

127
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
我们的采矿记录有多厉害
And how perfect is my mining record?

128
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,850
无人能敌 艾丽塔
So perfect, Elita-1!

129
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,220
我们只差三十单位的能量晶体
We are a mere 30 units of Energon away

130
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,250
我就可以晋升为主管
from my promotion to supervisor.

131
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,820
你们为我高兴吗
Are you happy for me?

132
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,220
很高兴 艾丽塔
So happy, Elita-1!

133
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,990
艾丽塔……我是说队长
Elita... I mean Captain,

134
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,700
你今天早上看起来容光焕发 新发油?
you are looking especially shiny this morning. New polish?

135
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
派克斯 很抱歉让你
Orion Pax, I'm sorry that I somehow

136
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,490
误会我们是朋友了
gave you the impression that we're friends.

137
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,970
接受道歉
Apology accepted.

138
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,710
把那面墙点亮 我们走  十秒后
Light up that wall! Let's go! Ten seconds!

139
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,330
我很乐意冲锋陷阵 队长
Happy to take the lead today, Captain.

140
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,970
感觉自己干劲十足
Feeling like I have enough power in me

141
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,880
我亲自给你去挖星球核心
to drill down and touch Primus myself.

142
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,540
你没有那种劲 也没有那心
You don't have the touch or the power.

143
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,750
各就各位 拖油瓶们 我们动工
Ready positions, rust buckets! Let's go!

144
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,680
她今天心情很好
She's in a good mood today. Mm-hmm.

145
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,410
你准备好了吗 时刻准备着
You ready? Always ready.

146
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,050
我们打卡吧
Let's punch in.

147
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,760
开始吧 时间不多
Here we go. This one won't be open long.

148
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,090
隧桥加固
Brace it up!

149
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,020
准备 加固
Here we go! Bridge!

150
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,260
隧桥加固
Brace up!

151
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,600
下层通道开启
Lower channel is open.

152
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,360
开足马力
Drill power on max!

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,460
低处加固
Low bridge!

154
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
把它钻出来
Drill it out!

155
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,610
我钻到了矿脉
I tapped a vein!

156
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,450
这里撑不住了 我们得撤 快跑
It's unstable! We got to go, we got to move!

157
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,490
撤离
Evacuate!

158
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,100
所有人出去 立即撤离
Everyone out! Evacuate immediately!

159
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,770
隧道正在关闭
The tunnel is closing.

160
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,770
重复 隧道正在关闭
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

161
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,940
你跟得上吗 D 我就在你后面 别落下了
You with me, D? On your six! Keep going!

162
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,910
当心
Look out!

163
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,280
爵士被困住了
Jazz is stuck!

164
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
艾丽塔 有个矿工被困
Elita, we've got a trapped miner.

165
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,310
我现在返回去营救
I'm falling back to assist.

166
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,090
不行 不能破坏规则 马上撤离
Negative. Do not break protocol. Evacuate!

167
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,220
我们需要更多的外力
We're gonna need more lift.

168
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,580
隧道要关闭了 带好包裹赶紧离开
It's closing! Just grab your pack and go.

169
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,830
对 好主意
Yeah. Good idea.

170
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,160
什么 不 我不是那个意思
What? No, I didn't mean it!

171
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,800
把他拉出来
Pull him clear!

172
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,600
派克斯 什么情况
Pax, what's happening?

173
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,300
没什么 我就是遵循了规则
Nothing much. Just normal protocol-following stuff.

174
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,910
现在一切都好
It's all good.

175
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,240
哦 这下可不太好了
Oh, that's not good.

176
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,820
奥利安 派克斯 你能快点离开死亡隧道吗
Orion Pax, could you please exit the tunnel of death?

177
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,920
艾丽塔 这里马上就要全部塌方了
Elita, it's about to get messy out there!

178
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,060
快 快
Go, go, go!

179
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,860
快跑 快跑
Run! Run!

180
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,690
快点 我们要赶不上了
Hurry! We're not gonna make it!

181
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,800
快点 快 快
Come on! Go, go, go!

182
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,670
搞什么鬼 派克斯 我说了赶紧撤离
What the hell, Pax? I told you to evacuate.

183
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,240
我做了啊 如果我因为你而被解雇…
I did, eventually. If I get fired because of you...

184
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,210
得了吧 他们不会解雇你的
Oh, please. They're not gonna fire you.

185
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,640
艾丽塔 你被解雇了
Elita-1, you're fired.

186
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,710
什么 为什么 我严格遵守了规则
What? Why? I followed protocol to the letter.

187
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,650
她说的是真的 是我破坏的规则
That is true. I was the one who broke the rules.

188
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,320
你闭嘴
No one asked you!

189
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,620
黑云 求你了 我一直任劳任怨的
Darkwing, please, I've worked too hard for this.

190
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,690
你是没有变形齿轮的机器人 没有权力选择
You are no-cog bots with limited options.

191
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,360
去废物管理部门报到 马上
Report to waste management immediately.

192
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,030
废物管理部门
Waste management?

193
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,030
-艾丽塔 -下次毁了别人生活前
Elita... Next time, why don't you stop and think

194
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,560
先动动你的脑子
before you ruin someone's life?

195
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,730
我很抱歉
I'm sorry!

196
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,110
-黑云 -别这样
Hey, Darkwing! Don't do it.

197
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,340
我或许没有变形齿轮 但我的手指可以变形
I may not have a cog, but my finger can transform.

198
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,280
猜猜是哪个 我让你也没有选择的权利
Guess which one? I'll give you a "limited option."

199
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,920
不好意思 先生
Excuse me, sir.

200
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,820
请允许我
Allow me.

201
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,250
为他的无礼……道歉
I apologize on his behalf for the...

202
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,790
什么
Why?

203
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,670
真的很痛
That really hurt.

204
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,210
-你到底想干嘛 -他出手太重
What'd you expect? He's metal.

205
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,880
你也太过分了
You know you were out of line,

206
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,110
敢跟上级顶嘴
talking back to a superior like that.

207
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,280
黑云先过分的 他活该
Darkwing was out of line. He deserves it.

208
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,580
你难道甘心我们一辈子被当作废物对待吗
Aren't you tired of being treated like we're nothing?

209
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,020
他完全有权利打我 是我掺和进来的
He had every right to hit me. I interfered.

210
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,750
我很感激你一直挺我
Hey, and I appreciate you having my back.

211
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,870
有你和我在一起
I'm glad you were there with me

212
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,460
被人打一拳 也挺有趣
to get punched in the face. That was fun.

213
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,690
随时奉陪 老兄
Anytime, buddy.

214
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,600
各部门注意
Attention, all sectors.

215
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,730
准备播放御天敌的直播画面
Stand by for a live transmission from Sentinel Prime.

216
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,640
他回来了吗 他已经回来了吗 也许他找到了领导模块
He's back? He's back already? Maybe he found the Matrix.

217
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,210
开始了吗 好的 谢谢
Is it on? Okay, thank you.

218
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,050
你们好 朋友们
Hello, my friends.

219
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,610
你好 铁堡
Hello, Iacon City!

220
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,250
向我们的救星 勤劳的矿工们问好
Hello to our saviors, the industrious miners

221
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,260
他们为维持我们的能量晶体储备而无私奉献
who toil selflessly to maintain our Energon reserves.

222
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,190
我向你们致敬
I celebrate you.

223
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,560
谦卑且得体 这是领袖风范
Humility and presence! That's leadership!

224
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,530
没有人比他更优秀了
Ah! Nobody does it better!

225
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,300
我和我的舰队又一次侥幸脱险归来
Once again, I have narrowly returned with my fleet

226
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,970
经历了又一次危险的探险之旅
after another treacherous expedition

227
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,340
穿越了地表的无人区
across the desolate, dangerous surface of our planet.

228
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,880
期望此行能找到领导模块
I departed with hopes of finding the Matrix of Leadership,

229
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,080
它是能让塞伯坦回到正轨的关键
the key to bringing balance to Cybertron.

230
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,110
很遗憾
I regret to inform you

231
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,510
我们这次还是空手而归
that we've returned empty-handed.

232
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,150
这是一次挫折 但绝不是失败
This is a setback, but not a failure.

233
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,190
请大家放心 我一定会找到领导模块
Rest assured, I will find the Matrix of Leadership,

234
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,650
让能量晶体再次流动
so that Energon can flow again.

235
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,460
但那都是后话了
But that's in the future.

236
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,760
而现在 我觉得我们都应该放松一下
Right now, I think we all deserve a little fun!

237
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,300
明天 无需工作 全天休息
Tomorrow, there will be no work. All shifts off

238
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,010
因为明天要举办铁堡五千大奖赛
because tomorrow is the Iacon 5000!

239
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,830
我最喜欢的比赛
My favorite event.

240
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,870
这是一场让铁堡活力四射的高强度比赛
A high-octane race all across Iacon City.

241
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,150
让我们来看看有多少参赛者能证明他们外壳之下 超越眼见
Let's all see which competitor can prove they are truly more than meets the eye.

242
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,440
太好了 你醒了 来吧 我有个主意
Oh, good, you're up. Come on, I have an idea.

243
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,370
不管是什么 最好是个好主意
Whatever this is, it better be good.

244
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,080
对 对 好吧 你看
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Listen.

245
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,180
如果说 如果
All right, what if... what if...

246
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,680
明天呢
what if tomorrow

247
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,520
我们一起参加铁堡五千大奖赛 怎么样
we ran in the Iacon 5000, huh?

248
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,490
不如我杀了你 因为你把我吵醒了
What if kill you for waking me up?

249
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,220
别 别 听我说完
No, no, no, hear me out.

250
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,690
我们不一定需要赢得比赛
We don't even have to win!

251
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,060
对啊 因为我们根本不可能
Oh, that's good, because we wouldn't.

252
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,260
但是…但是只要我们赢过一个变形金刚
But... But if we beat just one Transformer,

253
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
就能证明我们和他们一样优秀
it proves we're just as good as they are.

254
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,400
到时候我们会被载入史册
Not only would we go down in history,

255
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,730
采矿机器人完成了不可能的任务
the mining bots that did the impossible,

256
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,600
还会向所有人证明我们…
but we would show everyone that we're...

257
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,670
的能力远不止如此
we're capable of so much more!

258
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,010
或者当众出丑
Or we get publicly humiliated

259
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,740
降一级矿工
and then busted back to tier one.

260
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,680
是啊 但至少我们能做一番作为 你懂吧
Yeah, but at least we would've done something, you know?

261
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,310
派克斯……来吧 D
Pax... Come on, D.

262
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,780
派克斯
Pax.

263
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,650
我们就是不会变形的采矿机器人
We're mining bots who can't transform.

264
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,880
我们不会飞 也不会翻滚
We can't fly, we can't roll,

265
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,220
更不能参加比赛
we can't race.

266
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,290
来吧 我们回去吧
Come on, let's go.

267
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,290
好吧 那好吧
All right, fine.

268
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,030
也许你是对的
Yeah, maybe you're right.

269
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,100
也许吧
Maybe.

270
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,670
铁堡五千大奖赛终于要开始了
The Iacon 5000 is finally here!

271
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,240
我给你们准备了惊喜 跟我来
I have a surprise for you. Come on.

272
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,440
你要去哪里 赛场在那边
Where are you going? The stadium's that way.

273
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,110

274
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,220
太好了 这下我们要迟到了
Great. We're gonna be late now.

275
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,350
我想要占个好座位呢
I wanted good seats.

276
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,220
我们大老就为了远来这里 而错过开幕式 太棒了
We came all this way to miss the opening ceremony. This is wonderful!

277
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,990
相信我 我知道我在做什么
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

278
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,060
停下
Hold up!

279
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,760
如果没躲过 你就会被吹飞半个城市
Get caught in one of those, it'll launch you halfway across the city.

280
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,360
好吧 你到底要带我去哪
Okay, where are you taking me?

281
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,760
别像个傻子 这绝对值得 相信我
Don't be a glitch, this will be totally worth it. Trust me.

282
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,110
嘿 你就喜欢这样
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

283
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,800
我知道这对你来说很有趣
Look, I know this is, like, fun for you,

284
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,370
就像我们开玩笑没啥
like, we're joking around,

285
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,970
但如果你让我错过了铁堡五千大奖赛的的任何部分
but if you make me miss any part of the Iacon 5000,

286
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,540
我发誓我会把你的脸…
I swear I will smelt your face right off your...

287

Put your hands together as today's competitors are taking the field.

289
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,590

Look! There's Thunderglide and Behemoth!

290
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,270
这角度难以置信 我觉得我身临其境啊
This is unbelievable! I feel like I'm in the race!

291
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,030
这是为我准备的吗
You did this for me?

292
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,140
不
No.

293
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
为了我们
I did this for us.

294

现在是万众期待的时刻
And now the moment you've all been waiting for.

295
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,420
铁堡的偶像
The icon of Iacon!

296
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,550
塞伯坦的救世主
The savior of Cybertron!

297
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,160
五面怪的克星 我们的偶像
Quintessons fear him, but we love him!

298
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,330
我们的领袖 独一无二的…
Our leader, the one and only...

299
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,130
御天敌

302

朋友们 我塞伯坦家人们
My friends. My Cybertronian family.

303
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,040
五十年前
It has been precisely 50 cycles

304
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,580
自从五面怪入侵了我们的家园
since the Quintessons attacked our home.

305
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,120
五十年前我们失去了领导模块
Fifty cycles since we lost the Matrix of Leadership

306
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,750
我们的能源晶体供应枯竭
and our Energon supply dried up.

307
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,820
五十年前 我们在战场上去世了其他的领袖
Fifty cycles since the battle that killed the other Primes,

308
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,790
失去了很多兄弟姐妹
my brothers and sisters in arms.

309
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,020
今天我们在这里一起缅怀为我们牺牲的领袖们
Today we honor the Primes who gave their lives for ours

310
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,730
我们共同证明塞伯坦的力量永远不会枯竭
and we show them that the strength of Cybertron will never be diminished.

311
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,570
选手们 各就各位
Racers, on your marks!

312
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,220
真不敢相信我们能站在起跑线上观看比赛
I can't believe we get to watch from the starting line.

313
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,750
最佳的视角
The best seats in the house!

314
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,850
你为什么带着飞行包
Why'd you bring jetpacks?

315
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,590
预备
Get set!

316
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,390
是时候向他们展示我们远不止于此的能力了
It's time to show them we are more than meets the eye.

317
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,790
哦 不
Oh, no.

318
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,860
他们出发了
And they're off!

319
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,900
你疯了吗 这感觉就对了
Are you crazy? Sure feels like it.

320
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,900
铁堡五千大奖赛开始了
The Iacon 5000 has begun!

321
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,780
等等 怎么矿工也在参加比赛吗
I'm sorry, are those miners in the race?

322
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,220
矿工 他们是矿工 和我们一样
Miners! Those are miners, like us!

323
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,110
真的难以置信 居然有矿工参加比赛
I can't believe what I'm seeing here! Miners trying to run

324
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,820
在铁堡五千大奖赛 你在跟我开玩笑吧
in the Iacon 5000! You've got to be kidding me.

325
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,920
这太疯狂了
This is insane!

326
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,560
有矿工参赛 矿工
There are miners in the race! Miners?

327
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,790
不可能 他们连变形都不会
No way! They can't even transform!

328
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,630
是奥利安 派克斯和D-16
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

329
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,030
这是铁堡五千大奖赛历史上的首次
This is a first in Iacon 5000 history.

330
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,130
他们能坚持到最后吗
How are they going to survive?

331
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,000
如果我们能坚持到终点 我要宰了你
If we survive this, I'm gonna kill you!

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,480
我接受前面半句
I accept those terms.

333
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,850
顺风在主路追上了领先者
It's Tailwind pulling into the lead down the main stretch

334
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,620
紧随其后的是扫射和天火
followed by Strafe and Skyfire!

335
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,620
嘿 小心
Hey, look out!

336
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,730
我欠你一个人情 你欠我的多了去了
I owe you one. More like a thousand.

337
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,930
真不敢相信我们不是最后一名
I can't believe we're not in last place!

338
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000
吃我一棍 矿工
Eat it, miner!

339
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
黑云带来了毁灭性的一击 抓好了
Darkwing delivers a devastating blow! Gotcha!

340
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,180
我们还不够快 即兴发挥吧
We're not fast enough! Improvise!

341
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,300
给我下去 激转 你是我的偶像
Hey! Get off! Spinout! Big fan!

342
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,560
天暴 不好意思 偶像
Hey! Jetstorm, I'm so sorry. Big fan!

343
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,190

344
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,240
把握好节奏
Time it just right!

345
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,110
预备 跳
And... now!

346
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,910
躲开
Move!

347
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,180
矿工已被远远甩在了后面
And the miners have fallen way behind.

348
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,050
我们现在可以专注于这场比赛中真正的竞争者了
We can now focus on the real contenders in this race.

349
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,350
难以置信 矿工居然干掉了黑云
I don't believe it! The miners take down Darkwing!

350
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,040
矿工
Oh, miners!

351
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,780
表现不错啊 黑云
Great effort, Darkwing!

352
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,620
成功了 我们成功了
That worked! It actually worked!

353
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,790
这算是我们做过的最蠢的事吗
Is this the dumbest thing we've ever done?

354
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,330
绝对 最最蠢的
Oh, yeah, it's up there!

355
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,260
不 不

359
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,450
两名矿工现在处于第一位置

360
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,420
真是难以置信
This is unbelievable!

361
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,190

363
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,600
一位矿工现在正背着另一位
One miner is now carrying the other

364
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,960
距离终点线只有几步之遥
mere steps from the finish line

克劳蒂娅后来居上拿到了冠军
Chromia comes from behind to take the prize.

369
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,980
这是一场千年难遇的比赛
Talk about an Iacon 5000 for the ages.

370
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,750
好吧 拿下第二名还是不错的
Well, second place is still pretty good.

371
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
呼叫救护车医生 救护车医生 请到94号医疗舱
Paging Dr. Ratchet. Dr. Ratchet to Medical Bay 94.

372
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,860
别担心 你很快就会好起来的
Do not worry. You will be fixed up in no time.

373
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,160
我赢了吗
Did I win?

374
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,800
你赢了参加奖
You participated.

375
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,700
所以…
So...

376
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,870
你觉得我们还要在这里待多久
how long do you think we'll be here?

377
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,140
别跟我说话
I'm not talking to you.

378
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,340
真不敢相信你居然拉着我干这事
You know what? I can't believe you made me do that.

379
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,820
我们完蛋了 我以为你不和我说话了
We are so screwed! Thought you weren't talking to me.

380
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,950
听着 我知道你不把这当回事 但我不同
Hey, look, I know it's all a big joke to you. But not me.

381
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,180
我努力工作 我要去更好地的地方
I was paying my dues. I was going places.

382
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,560
结果现在我不知道
And now they're gonna bust me down.

383
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,020
我…我都不知道要被降几级
I... I don't even know how many tiers!

384
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,830
对不起 D
I'm sorry, D.

385
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,560
但拜托 你感觉不到吗
But come on, didn't you feel it?

386
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,660
哪怕只有一秒钟 你不觉得解脱吗
Even for just a second, didn't you feel liberated?

387
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,290
难道你不觉得自己是另一个人吗
Didn't you feel like you were something else?

388
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,160
没觉得超出了所有人的预期吗
Like you could be more than what they say you are?

389
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,870
是 我感觉到了 感觉的到
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

390
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,540
可那有什么用
But it doesn't matter.

391
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,910
我们还是会被惩罚 降级
We're going to get punished and demoted.

392
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,010
御天敌会看到比赛的整个过程
Sentinel Prime saw the whole thing.

393
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,280
那更尴尬
This is so embarrassing.

394
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,960
安全
It's clear.

395
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,390
奥利安 派克斯
Orion Pax.

396
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,870
D-16
D-16.

397
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,510
你俩今天干的事
What you two did today

398
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,100
是我见过的最疯狂的事之一
was one of the craziest things I've ever seen.

399
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,610
先生 这完全是我一个人的主意 我很抱歉
Sir, this is all my idea, and we're so sorry.

400
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,040
我很喜欢
I loved it!

401
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,110
真的吗
You did?

402
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,980
怎么会有人不喜欢呢
How could anyone not love it?

403
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,750
你们让我最好的车手使出了浑身解数
You gave my best racers a real run for their money.

404
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,150
所以我们不会被降级了
So we're not getting demoted?

405
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,350
降级?
Demoted?

406
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,450
降级
Demoted.

407
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,460
发生了什么
What is happening?

408
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,260
事实是我们第一轮采矿才进行了一半
The fact of the matter is we're halfway into the first shift

409
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,640
比赛结束后 我们的矿工已经完成了150%的业绩
since the race ended and that mining crew has already reached 150% quota.

410
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,780
你们激励了他们更加努力工作
You inspired them to work harder!

411
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,880
御天敌 先生
Sentinel Prime, sir,

412
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,150
我们参加比赛是为了向大家展示我们的潜力
we joined the race to show everyone our potential.

413
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,080
我们矿工机器人能做的不仅仅会采矿…
That we bots can do more than just mine...

414
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,410
优秀 我欣赏独立思考的人
Outstanding! I love a bot that can think for himself.

415
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,150
也许你们俩可以去一下矿场
Perhaps you two could tour the mines,

416
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,450
和你的兄弟们谈谈 帮助他们挖掘自己的潜力
speak to your brethren, and help them see their potential.

417
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,600
哇 好
Wow! Okay, great.

418
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,390
听起来很不错啊
That sounds incredible.

419
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,290
我很乐意……先生 时间到了
I would love to... Sir, it's time.

420
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,930
是的
Ah, yes.

421
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,600
不好意思 朋友们
I'm sorry, friends.

422
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,670
我们在准备下一次的地表之旅
We're preparing our next travel to the surface.

423
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,470
在此之前 我要奖励你们
But in the meantime, I've got a treat for you.

424
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,610
等我一下 黑寡妇 派人护送这两位英雄
Hang tight. Airachnid, have someone escort these heroes

425
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,470
去我的私人接待处
to my personal service facilities.

426
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,470
用最好的服务
Best care in Iacon.

427
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,310
下回见 明星们
Until next time, legends.

428
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,090
御天敌 尊敬的御天敌
Sentinel Prime. The Sentinel Prime!

429
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,190
你还在生我的气 我没那么生你的气了
You still mad at me? I am less mad at you.

430
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,830
我和你说 D……我有一种很强烈的预感 一切都要变了
I'm telling you, D... I got a feeling that everything's gonna change

431
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,990
我们要…
and we're gonna go...

432
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,830
矿工
Miners!

433
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,900
黑云
Hi, Darkwing.

434
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,470
哦 不 不
Oh, no, no, no. No!

435
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,040
等等 等等 你不明白
Wait, wait! You don't understand!

436
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,540
我们要去御天敌的私人接待处
We were supposed to go to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

437
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,850
你们两个笨蛋 从今往后再也见不到任何人了
You two dolts aren't going to see anyone ever again.

438
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,340
我保证
I'll make sure of that.

439
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,650
你搞错了 问问御天敌
You're making a mistake! Ask Sentinel!

440
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,790
我讨厌那个家伙
I hate that guy!

441
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,330
你们 你们是怎么下来的
You! How did you get down here?

442
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,070
这层谁也不让进
There's no access to this level.

443
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,100
这里只有我一个人在
There is nobody down here but me.

444
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,650
天啊 你们是真人
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

445
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,880
你们是其他人 你们 不是…我
You're others! You're not... me!

446
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,620
你们在这里 而且你们不是我
You're here, and you're not me!

447
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,850
显然是这样 太棒了!
Uh, yeah. Awesome!

448
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,350
我很抱歉 你们一定觉得很奇怪
I am so sorry. That must have been weird for you.

449
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,550
从他们把我送到50层以来
I just haven't had a lot of company

450
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,660
就没有什么人来探望过我
since they put me down here in sublevel 50.

451
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,930
五十层 但是地下不是只有40层么
Fifty? But there are only 40 sublevels.

452
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,590
我原来也是这么想的
That's what I thought!

453
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,560
结果还有十多层 而且一点都不宜居
Turns out there are ten more, and they are not pleasant.

454
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,330
也许这就是为什么没人愿意提这事
Probably why nobody ever really talks about them.

455
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,740
你在这里多久了
How long have you been down here?

456
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,400
我在这里多久了
How long have I been here?

457
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
让我想想 差不多一辈子
Let's see, somewhere between a long time and forever?

458
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,340
我是说 我之前也有别的工作 但我一直被转岗
I mean, I had other jobs, but I kept getting reassigned

459
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,210
也许因为我太过出色了
'cause I'm so good at what I do.

460
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,250
顺便说一下 我是B-127
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

461
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,720
但你们也可以叫我B
But you can call me B.

462
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,380
我正好在想一些别的昵称什么的
And I'm actually working on some nicknames.

463
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,090
我现在想到那个是霸道金刚
The one I'm floating right now is Badassatron.

464
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,860
实际上发音是…霸道金刚
Which is actually pronounced... "Badassatron."

465
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,230
但如果你们有什么更好的意见…
But if you have any critiques...

466
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,230
很好 很好 你知道我们怎么能离开这里吗
Yeah, great. How do we get out of here?

467
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,160
好问题 你们走不了
Great question. You don't.

468
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,770
我们走不了 走不了
We don't? Nope.

469
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,070
我们本来能去垃圾管理部转转
We have limited access to the waste management area,

470
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,140
但那里新来的经理不喜欢被打搅
but the new shift manager there does not like distractions.

471
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,180
是的 他们更希望我们守在岗位上埋头苦干
No, they prefer we stay here on the task at hand.

472
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,750
干什么呢
Which is? Oh!

473
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,690
废料从那里的斜槽进来
The scrap comes in from the chute there

474
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,480
放到传送带上
onto the conveyor belt.

475
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,420
我们的工作就是在它们进入熔炉之前
Our job is to look for anything that might be worth salvaging

476
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,120
挑出值得回收的东西
before it hits the furnace and gets smelted.

477
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,160
所以你负责燃烧垃圾
So you watch garbage burn.

478
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,650
没错
Yes!

479
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,290
你们能来真是太好了
It is so great that you're here now.

480
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,190
我迫不及待地想了解你们的一切
I can't wait to learn everything about you.

481
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,030
然后告诉你们关于我的一切
And then tell you everything about me!

482
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,940
我有很多的梦想 就等着你们两个
I have a lot of hopes and dreams that I am just dying to share

483
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,270
新的好朋友一起分享
with one or two new best friends.

484
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,470
可以 我很乐意……
Uh, yeah, I would love to...

485
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,140
我很失礼
Where are my manners?

486
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,940
来吧 我给你们介绍一下其他人
Come on, I'll introduce you to the rest of the crew.

487
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
伙计们 我们来客人了
Hey, guys, we've got company!

488
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,750
这是EP-508
This is EP-508,

489
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,510
这是A-A创 还有这位是史蒂夫
this is A-A-Tron, and this fella here is Steve.

490
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,920
“史蒂夫” 是的 他是老外
"Steve"? Yeah, he's foreign.

491
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,890
他们会和你说话
Do they talk back to you?

492
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,190
嗯 他们不是活人
Um, they're not real.

493
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,830
天啊 你觉得我疯了吗
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

494
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,290
只是你一直呆在这里…
It's just you've been down here a...

495
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,870
不 我在和史蒂夫说话呢
No, I was talking to Steve.

496
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,490
经典的史蒂夫
Classic Steve.

497
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,300
那是什么 看看这个家伙
What is that? Look at this guy.

498
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,330
声音是从内部发出的
It's coming from inside.

499
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,840
哦 史蒂夫 不
Oh! Steve! No!

500
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,040
我很抱歉 史蒂夫 不
I am so sorry. Steve, no!

501
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,140
我们能修好的 别担心 我的史蒂夫
We can fix it, don't worry. My Steve!

502
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,050
五面怪偷袭
Quintesson ambush!

503
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,190
呼叫至高守卫 立即支援 立即支援
Calling the High Guard for immediate support. Immediate support!

504
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,450
那是钛师傅
That's Alpha Trion.

505
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,990
元祖金刚
One of the Primes?

506
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,320
重复一遍 竞天择遇袭
Repeat, Zeta Prime has fallen!

507
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,160
这是一则紧急求救信息 保护领导模块
It's an SOS message. Protect the Matrix!

508
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,430
发送位置坐标 发送位置坐标
Sending location coordinates. Sending location coordinates.

509
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,340
我勒个尊啊
Holy Primus!

510
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,640
那个位置的坐标就在地表上某处
Those are coordinates to a location on the surface.

511
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,240
这里可能就是元祖金刚在战争中牺牲的地方
This could be where the Primes died in the Quintesson war.

512
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,680
也就是说 我们也许能在那附近找到
Which means this is where we could find

513
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,020
领导模块
the Matrix of Leadership.

514
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,550
你在胡说什么 这不过是在垃圾堆里掉出来的老信号灯
What are you talking about? It's an old beacon inside a statue made of garbage.

515
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,190
或者也是我们找到领导模块的线索
Or it's a clue of how we could find

516
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,960
不 不可能 绝对不可能
the Matrix of Leadership. No. No way. Absolutely not!

517
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,760
嘿 D 别这样 这可能是我们向大家证明我们不是…
Hey, D, come on, this could be our chance to show everyone we're not...

518
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,200
你已经骗我去参加比赛了
You already tried to "show everyone"

519
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,730
并向所有人证明过自己了
in the race you tricked me into running,

520
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,100
而结果就是我们困在了这里
which got us stuck down here

521
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,530
在这个垃圾堆里 还有这个…
in this waste hole with this, uh...

522
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,470
很酷的小伙
really cool guy.

523
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,700
哦 谢谢 我只是说…
Oh, thank you. I'm just saying...

524
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,510
没人去过地表肯定是有原因的
There's a reason no one goes to the surface.

525
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,240
是太危险了
It's dangerous!

526
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,610
我就在这里等着御天敌找到这里 哪里也不去
I'm waiting right here until Sentinel Prime finds us.

527
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,480
哦 行吧 可以
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

528
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,550
好吧 我们就永远呆在这里等下去 你没意见吧 B
Well, we'll just stay here forever. That cool with you, B?

529
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,960
永远吗  太棒了
Forever? This is great!

530
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,190
我有新的同事和新室友陪我
I have new coworkers and roommates.

531
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,120
既然史蒂夫不在了 这里就有很多空间了
There's plenty of room now that Steve is dead.

532
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,260
我通常睡在传送带上 不过你也可以睡
I usually sleep on the conveyor belt, but you can totally have it.

533
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,790
我和A-A创挤一下就行
I'll sleep in the corner next to A-A-Tron.

534
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,530
有足够的空间让你伸展身体
Plenty of room for you to stretch out, too,

535
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,930
毕竟你比我高 明白我的意思吗
'cause you're taller than I am. Know what I mean?

536
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,040
D 如果你亲自交给御天敌你发现的领导模块
Hey, D, what do you think Sentinel's reaction would be if you personally handed him

537
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,010
你觉得他会有什么反应
the Matrix of Leadership that you found?

538
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,910
好了 打住 我知道你想说什么
Okay, stop. I know what you're trying to do.

539
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,180
而且这招有效 我参加行了吧
And it's definitely working. I'm in.

540
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,710
哈 好 果然是好哥们 我们怎么能去到地表
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy. How do we get to the surface?

541
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,890
开什么玩笑 地表
Pfft! You kidding me? The surface?

542
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,020
简单 我知道一条路
Easy. I know a way.

543
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,780
但这并不容易
But it won't be easy.

544
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,750
为什么有这么多垃圾 啊
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

545
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,130
下次请提醒我 我张着嘴
Warn me next time, please. My mouth was open.

546
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,620
只有49层了
Only 49 sublevels to go!

547
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,790
垃圾处理列车是唯一的交通工具
Waste-disposal trains are the only vehicles

548
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,970
一直开往地表
that go all the way to the surface.

549
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,430
知道 可他们不载人 这些列车都是无人驾驶的
Yes but they don't allow passengers. The trains are autonomous.

550
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,830
是啊 这就是不简单的路
Yeah, that's the "won't be easy" part.

551
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,310
完美 我们在车厢里是最安全的
It's perfect. We'll be safe inside the train.

552
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,410
这是最后一个 都运走
That's the last one. Send 'er up!

553
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,160
等等 还有一个
Hold up! One more.

554
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,530
我来关门
I'll lock it down.

555
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,830
多亏你这个傻瓜 无论是谁
Thanks for being an idiot, whoever you are.

556
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,980
把你拿下 肯定能让我升职加薪
Turning you in will definitely get me promoted back up a rank or two.

557
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,020
抓到了
Got her!

558
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,210
不 等等 我…
No, wait, I...

559
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,550
艾丽塔 住手
Elita! Stop!

560
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,350
奥利安 派克斯 等一下 让我……
Orion? Hold on, let me...

561
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,580
保安 通知……
Security! Sound the ala...

562
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,900
她往引擎室那边去了 别担心 我来处理
She's headed to the engine! Don't worry, I got this.

563
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,230
等等 听我解释 我们有任务在身
Hold on, let me explain! We're on a mission!

564
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,400
我也有 我也要毁了你的人生
So am I. To ruin your life.

565
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,020
艾丽塔 等等 我们发现了一条信息 我们知道……
Elita, wait. We found a message. We know where...

566
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,880
这娘们疯了 她是谁
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

567
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,420
没路了 艾丽塔 这里没路了……
Dead end, Elita. There's no way...

568
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,620
好吧 她走了
Well, she's gone.

569
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,830
为什么呢 我何苦呢 我这是何苦啊
Why? Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this?

570
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,980
快点爬!
Climb faster!

571
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,290
抓到了!
Gotcha!

572
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,660
这就是地表
Ah, the surface.

573
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,200
真是 太美了
It's beautiful.

574
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,140
我词穷了
I am speechless.

575
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,630
艾丽塔 听我说
Elita, listen to me.

576
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,900
我们知道哪里可以找到领导模块
We know where the Matrix of Leadership is.

577
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,940
哦 当然 我其实是元祖金刚
Oh, sure. And I'm really a Prime.

578
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,350
我只是更喜欢装一箱箱的有害垃圾
I just prefer loading crates of toxic waste.

579
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,840
你从哪儿弄来的这东西
Whoa. Where did you get this?

580
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,610
从我的朋友史蒂夫 奥利安弄死了他
From my friend Steve. Orion killed him.

581
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,090
我没有弄死史蒂夫 他压根死不了
I did not kill Steve. He was never alive.

582
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,490
什么 是这样
What? Look.

583
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,690
御天敌告诉我们他要去地表
Sentinel told us he was going to the surface,

584
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,590
然后我们发现了这个信息
and then we found this message.

585
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,820
我们想把这东西可以亲手交给他
We figured that we could hand deliver it to him

586
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,820
或者我们自己先去侦察一下地点
or scout the locations ourselves.

587
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,130
两个方案都行
Whichever comes first.

588
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,700
事关重大 不能再等了
This was too important to wait.

589
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,400
它将改变我们所有人的生活
It will change all of our lives.

590
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,210
不 不行
No, no, no, no.

591
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,510
我不想再一次因为你被降级
I'm not going to get demoted again because of you.

592
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,380
我们要调头 我要通知…
I'm turning this rig around and I'm notifying the...

593
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,310
各位 伙计们
Hey, guys? Guys?

594
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,380
那是什么
What is that?

595
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,010
它是不是越来越大了
Is it getting bigger?

596
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,850
还是越来越近
Or closer?

597
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,930
不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no!

598
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,540
别关门啊 不要 不要啊
Are you closing? Don't close. Stop closing.

599
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
关上了
It's closed!

600
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,740
不是吧
Oh, come on!

601
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,780
现在我知道为什么没有愿意来地表
Oh, now I know why no one comes to the surface!

602
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,540
艾丽塔
Elita?

603
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,870
艾丽塔
Elita?

604
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,350
你没事吧
You okay?

605
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,610
别再打我的脸了
Please stop punching me in the face.

606
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,810
帮我一下
Can you help?

607
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,650
铁堡……列车……
Iacon... The train...

608
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,880
列车去哪里了 放轻松 好吗 它马上来了
Where's the train? Relax, okay? Here it comes.

609
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,920
然后又走了
And there it goes.

610
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,050
好吧 我弄错了 另一个方向
Okay, I was wrong about that. It was going the other way.

611
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,240
好吧 我想现在我们在这
Okay, so I think this is us,

612
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,770
如果沿着这条路…现在你给我听好
and if we follow the path to... Now you listen to me,

613
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,350
你这个事故不断的家伙
Mr. "Zero Seconds Since My Last Accident"!

614
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,450
我会继续我们的小任务 因为我已经别无选择
I'll go on your little quest because I don't have a choice.

615
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,320
但由我拿着地图 我来带路 如果最后一无所获
But I carry the map, I navigate, and if this leads to nothing,

616
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,920
那我就把你连同那两个白痴机器人
then I'm dragging you and those two idiot go-bots

617
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,320
带回铁堡
back to Iacon City

618
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,990
路上看到的第一个监工站
and to the first supervisor depot we see,

619
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,960
给我把发生的一切解释清楚
at which point you will explain everything that's happened,

620
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,760
并且必须用非常正面积极的措辞
using words that reflect me

621
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,030
汇报我的事迹 我讲清楚了吗
in a very positive light! Got it?

622
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,300
好的 成交 太好了 好吧
Yeah, okay. Deal. Great. All right.

623
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,640
我们走 她要加入我们吗
Let's go! She's joining us?

624
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,270
太棒了
Fantastic!

625
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,670
嗨 呃 是艾丽塔吧 我的发音对吗
Hi there. Uh, Elita, right? Am I saying that right?

626
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,940
我想正式介绍一下我自己
Wanted to formally introduce myself.

627
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,610
我是B-127 就是你之前在那用膝盖打了我脸的那位
I'm B-127. You kneed me in the face earlier, back there.

628
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,290
你可以叫我B 或者霸道金刚
You can call me B, or Badassatron.

629
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,050
是别人给我起的绰号
It's a nickname some of the guys gave me.

630
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,460
我也不懂什么意思 反正不是我起的
I don't know. I didn't give it to myself or anything.

631
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,560
实际上 它的发音是……霸道金刚
Actually, it's pronounced... "Badassatron,"

632
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,660
如果你喜欢的话
in case you were wondering.

633
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,960
霸道金刚
Badassatron.

634
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
你喜欢这名字 对吧
You like that, right?

635
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,160
霸道……我需要你闭嘴
Badass... I'm gonna need you to talk less.

636
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,930
当然  不…好 没问题
Sure! No... Yeah, no problem.

637
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,640
我少说了什么 我的绰号吗
What am I talking less about, my nickname?

638
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,940
我没意见 这里有一些山…
That's fine with me. Got some mountains over here...

639
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,840
嘿 你在想当你把领导模块交给御天敌时
Hey. You're thinking about what you'll say

640
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,810
说些什么吧
when you hand the Matrix to Sentinel, aren't you?

641
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,110
不停在想
I can't help it.

642
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,380
D 我们这回来真的了
D, we're really doing this.

643
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,850
很高兴能和你一起来这里 你这主意真不错
So glad I'm out here with you. This was a great idea.

644
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,490
我只是玩得很开心
I'm just having a good time.

645
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,050
地图上 距离领导模块还有多远
How much further is the Matrix on the map?

646
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,560
做准确一点的预估
Make an educated guesstimate.

647
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,530
我明确告诉你 这是我人生中最酷的事
This is the coolest thing that has ever happened

648
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,490
最酷的人 最酷的地方
to anyone anywhere, I'm telling you!

649
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,890
不是一个 不是两个 也不是三个 而是四个
♪ Not one, not two Not three, but four ♪

650
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,160
四个好朋友手牵手 往门里来
♪ Four best friends who are Walking through the door ♪

651
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,570
这里没有门 我们在户外
There's no doors, we're outside.

652
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,060
看 这里更多
Hey, look, there's more of it over here.

653
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,670
这是什么 它不是金属
What is it? It's not metal.

654
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,140
像某种奇怪的自然物 好奇怪
It's like some kind of weird nature. It's weird.

655
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,540
那里也有
So are they.

656
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,140
去找领导模块
♪ Going to the Matrix ♪

657
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,680
和最好的朋友一起
♪ With my best friends ♪

658
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,710
那是什么声音
What was that?

659
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,600
我感觉不对劲 快撤
I think this is not right. We should go.

660
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,430
好主意 快跑
Yeah, good idea. Run!

661
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,500
我们在躲什么
What are we running from?

662
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,560
那是什么 哦 不
What is that? Oh, no.

663
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,730
这是艘五面怪的军舰 什么
It's a Quintesson ship. What?

664
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,430
我们该怎么办  该怎么办 嘘 安静
What do we do? What do we do? Shh! Quiet.

665
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,320
它在扫描生命体 走 快走
It's scanning for life-forms. Move, move!

666
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,280
等一下
Wait!

667
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,120
快 快
Go, go, go, go!

668
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,260
来啊
Come on!

669
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,000
他们不会成功的
They're not gonna make it.

670
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
什么……他们在寻找什么
What... What were they searching for?

671
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,000
-某人的抱抱 -B.我怎么知道
Someone to hug, B. How should I know?

672
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,060
我不会等着被发现的
I'm not waiting around to find out.

673
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,440
这边 我们接近了
This way. We're close.

674
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,230
五面怪已经有五十年没来了
Quintessons haven't been here for 50 cycles.

675
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,910
这说不通啊 外面什么都没有
It doesn't make sense. There's nothing out here.

676
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,500
有利齿的山洞 没什么可怕的
A cave with teeth. Nothing scary about that.

677
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,170
洞顶倒插着刀子 神奇
Knives coming out of the ceiling. Amazing.

678
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,680
各位 我们一定要进去吗
Everyone, do we have to go insi...?

679
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,750
好了 我们要进去了
Okay, yep, we're going in.

680
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,050
为什么一定要 走进了我这辈子见过
Why shouldn't we? Just walking into the scariest place

681
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,550
最可怕的地方
I've ever seen in my entire life.

682
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,620
这太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

683
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,980
我不相信
I don't believe it.

684
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,110
元祖金刚
The Primes.

685
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,880
我们找到了
We're here.

686
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,860
震天尊
Megatronus Prime.

687
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,640
竞天择
Zeta Prime.

688
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,980
领导模块
The Matrix!

689
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,550
不见了
It's gone.

690
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,480
我们继续找
Let's keep looking.

691
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,720
伙计们
Hey, guys!

692
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,600
是钛师傅
It's Alpha Trion!

693
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,700
他能量耗尽了
He's powered down.

694
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,370
但他身上的火种仍未熄灭
But his spark is still lit.

695
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,760
五面怪伏击!
Quintesson ambush!

696
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,360
突袭!
Attack!

697
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,590
收到消息之前……
Message before...

698
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,800
没事了 没事了
Whoa, whoa, it's okay! It's okay.

699
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,640
你安全了
You're safe now.

700
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,370
战争结束了
The war is over.

701
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,360
我让你失望了 老朋友
I failed you, old friend.

702
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,360
你理应得到更好的结局
You deserved so much better than this end.

703
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,970
不 你没有失败
No, you didn't fail.

704
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,810
我们收到了你的讯息 来找领导模块的
We heard your message. We've come to find the Matrix.

705
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,010
你们的变形齿轮呢 你们发生什么事了
Your transformation cogs. What happened to you?

706
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,910
你们是谁
Who are you?

707
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,280
我们是从铁堡来的矿工
We're cogless miners, from Iacon.

708
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,380
矿工 为什么
Miners? Why?

709
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,820
我们挖矿寻找能源晶体
Well, we've had to drill for Energon

710
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,950
自从能源晶体停止流动
ever since it stopped flowing.

711
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,250
不可能
Impossible.

712
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,480
这就是我们来找寻领导模块的原因 去修复能源晶体
That's why we came. To fix things.

713
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,550
如果我们找到领导模块
If we find the Matrix of Leadership

714
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,290
然后把它交给御天敌元祖 他就能回复…
and get it to Sentinel Prime, he can fix...

715
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,670
御天敌不是元祖
Sentinel is no Prime.

716
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,430
怎么啦 坏了 太棒了
What? He's broken. Fantastic.

717
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,270
你在说什么 你为什么要这么说
What are you talking about? Why would you say that?

718
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,170
御天敌是我们星球的保护者
Sentinel Prime is our protector.

719
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,300
他把我们从五面怪的魔爪中拯救出来……
He's been saving us from the Quintessons ever since...

720
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,270
你们并没有得救 你们一直活在谎言中
You have not been saved. You've been living a lie.

721
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,280
而我亲眼看到了真相
I saw the truth with my own eyes.

722
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,410
来吧 我来告诉你
Come. I will show you.

723
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,890
千年轮回 五面怪的战争
For thousands of cycles, the war with the Quintessons

724
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,000
那是一场残酷的战争
had been a brutal conflict.

725
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,200
有一天 元祖金刚的副手御天敌自称
Until Sentinel, the principal aide to the Primes,

726
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,210
截获了敌人的信息
intercepted an enemy transmission.

727
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:04,110
五面怪的指挥官们将举行一次秘密聚会
There was going to be a secret gathering of Quintesson commanders.

728
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,880
能够消灭他们就可以结束这场战争
Their elimination could end the war.

729
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,050
这显然是一项非常重要的任务 我们元祖金刚责无旁贷
It was a mission so important, we Primes took it on ourselves.

730
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,320
御天敌建议我们一同分享他的秘密情报 我们同意了
We agreed to meet Sentinel for his sensitive intel in secret,

731
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,960
就在这个山洞里
here in this cave.

732
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,720
但山洞里还有别人
But we were not alone.

733
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,560
五面怪 他们在这
Quintessons! They're here!

734
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,070
这是个陷阱 准备战斗
It's a trap! Battle positions!

735
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,530
坚守阵地 元祖金刚与我们同在
Hold the line! Primus be with us!

736
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,640
为塞伯坦而战
For Cybertron!

737
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,350
我们虽寡不敌众 但万众一心
We were outnumbered, but stood as one.

738
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,580
眼看曙光乍现
Our victory was near.

739
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,060
可惜我们还是被出卖了
Until we were betrayed.

740
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,550
御天敌 为什么
Sentinel, why?

741
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,090
为塞伯坦的力量
For all the power of Cybertron.

742
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:32,660
但御天敌不明白他所渴望那个的力量
But Sentinel never understood the true power of what he desired.

743
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,730
领导模块 只能为元始天尊
The Matrix of Leadership can only be wielded

744
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,700
认同之人所用
by one that Primus himself deems worthy.

745
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,410
而御天敌绝对不是
And Sentinel most certainly was not.

746
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,480
不!
No!

747
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:58,790
等等 等一下 你是说领导模块就那么消失了
Wait. Hold on. You're saying that the Matrix of Leadership just vanished?

748
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,460
不
No.

749
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,870
不 不 不可能的 我不相信
No, no, no. That is impossible. I don't believe it.

750
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,730
御天敌为什么要这么做
Why would Sentinel do that?

751
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,330
做了一个交易
To make a bargain.

752
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,270
交易 和谁
A bargain? With who?

753
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,510
塞伯坦的新统治者
With the new rulers of Cybertron.

754
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,480
五面怪
The Quintessons.

755
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,710
它们的数量太多了
There are so many.

756
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,040
他来了
He's here.

757
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,280
御天敌来了
Sentinel Prime is here.

758
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,410
-睁大眼睛 -我一直都在睁大眼睛
Keep your eyes open. They always are.

759
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,990
我来装那些箱子
I load those crates.

760
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,420
里面装满受到污染的金属
Those are filled with contaminated metal.

761
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,130
我不明白
I don't understand.

762
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,760
五面怪要有害废弃物干嘛？
What do the Quintessons want with toxic waste?

763
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,100
他们要的是我们的能量晶体
Our Energon.

764
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,310
-叛徒-D 别这样
Traitor! D, no.

765
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,490
我知道我答应过你什么
I know what I promised you

766
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,630
但我们的矿场就快要枯竭了
but our mines, they're running out!

767
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,830
能量晶体勉强够我们之用
There's barely enough Energon for us.

768
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,630
我发誓我会把剩下的给你
I swear I will get you the rest.

769
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,180
每个班次加三倍工时
Triple-time every mining shift.

770
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,870
在我拿到能量晶体之前 所有矿工都不能休息
No miner gets a break until I get my Energon.

771
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,550
我全部都要 走吧
All of it! Let's go.

772
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,400
现在你们看到了真相
Now you have seen the truth.

773
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,340
每一天…
Every day...

774
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,940
我这辈子的每一天
Every single day of my life

775
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,510
都是一个谎言
has been a lie.

776
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,010
天哪 我就知道
My God, I knew it!

777
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,880
直觉告诉我有什么不对劲
Deep down, I always felt something was off.

778
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,390
他欺骗了 所有人
He deceived everyone.

779
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:53,560
御天敌窃取了权力 还要我们拼命工作 帮他还债
Sentinel bought himself power and then put us to work paying off his debt.

780
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,330
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

781
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,860
显然 我相信...
Well, obviously, I can believe it,

782
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,700
…我亲眼看到的 但我还是…
I just saw it, but I still...

783
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,730
无法相信
I can't believe it.

784
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,730
御天敌会撒谎
Sentinel lied

785
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,870
御天敌当着我的面…对我撒谎
to my face. It was all a sham.

786
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,710
一切都是骗局 我们就这么轻易地上当了
How could we have been so gullible?

787
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:12,350
这下一切都不一样了
Oh, this... this is going to change everything.

788
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,350
你非要这样不可 是吧
You just had to do it, didn't you?

789
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,690
我 我做什么了
Me? What did I do?

790
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,520
你非得要来地表
You just had to go to the surface,

791
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,560
你非得要参加铁堡五千大奖赛
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

792
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,130
你非得要违反规定
You just had to break protocol!

793
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,400
-谁在乎规则啊  -我在乎
Who cares about protocol? I do!

794
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,570
我在乎
I care!

795
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,210
只要遵守规则 就不会有意外发生
Because nothing bad happens when you stay on protocol!

796
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,700
御天敌一直逼我们
Sentinel Prime has been forcing us

797
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,070
在矿井里卖命工作 直到筋疲力尽
to work in the mines until our gears strip,

798
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,770
而他竟然转手就把能量晶体 送给我们最大的敌人
and all the while he's been giving the Energon away to our greatest enemies!

799
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,780
如果他发现我们知道了 你觉得他会怎么对我们
And what do you think he's going to do to us when he finds out that we know?

800
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,880
我不在乎他会做什么
I'm not thinking about what he's going to do,

801
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,550
我在想我们要做什么
I'm thinking about what we're going to do.

802
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,320
你就是这样
That's the whole thing!

803
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,720
从来都只顾着替自己着想 不顾别人
You're never thinking about anything else, just yourself!

804
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,050
太好了 你又有伟大计划 我等不及要听
Fantastic! Another Orion Pax master plan. I can't wait to hear this.

805
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,430
你难道不想阻止他
Don't you want to stop him?

806
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,330
不 我要杀了他
No, I want to kill him!

807
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,270
我想把御天敌锁起来
I want to put Sentinel in chains

808
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,930
拉着他穿越矿区
and march him through the mines

809
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,470
好让大家知道他是个冒牌元祖金刚
so everyone can see him for the false Prime that he is!

810
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:13,410
我要他在黑暗中吃尽苦头然后死去
I want him to suffer and then to die in darkness.

811
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,100
但我们都知道我要什么并不重要
But we all know that it doesn't matter

812
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,740
我想要的 对吧 派克斯
what I want, right, Pax?

813
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,350
事实上 我们只是没变形齿轮的机器人 对吗
The fact is, we're just cogless bots. Right?

814
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:28,190
我们的选择有限 而现在我们别无他选
We had limited options, and now... now we have none.

815
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:34,460
赛博坦所有的子民出生时都有变形齿轮
No son or daughter of Cybertron is born without a cog.

816
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,400
是吗 自我上流水线工作起就是这副摸样
Oh, yeah. I've been with myself since I came online,

817
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,370
这个位置自始至终都是空的
and this slot's always been empty.

818
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,400
你这话什么意思 你是说…
What are you saying? Are you saying...

819
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
不 不可能 谁都不会那么罪大恶极 御天敌也不会吧
No. No way. Nobody could be that evil, not even Sentinel.

820
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,450
他在你们上线前就把你们的变形齿轮拿走
He removed your cogs before you came online.

821
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,650
我们生来就有变形齿轮 而他…
We were born with transformation cogs, but he...

822
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,620
他把它们夺走了
He took them from us.

823
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,850
成为变形金刚
What defines a Transformer...

824
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,330
靠的不是他胸口的变形齿轮
...is not the cog in his chest

825
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:08,360
而是内心深处的那束火种
but the spark that resides in their core.

826
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,700
火种赋予了你们让世界变得更美好的意志
A spark that gives you the will to make your world better.

827
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,200
我的领袖同伴们也有这样的火种
My fellow Primes had that spark.

828
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,250
我在你身上看到了他们的力量
And I see their strength in you.

829
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:30,320
接受他们的变形齿轮 激发你们的潜力
Take their cogs and access your full potential.

830
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,450
先觉天
prima.

831
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,980
锐天骁
Onyx.

832
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,120
撷天萃
Alchemist.

833
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,330
微天星
Micronus.

834
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:45,160
拥有高尚灵魂的战士们 忠诚 坚韧
Warriors of noble spirit, loyalty, strength.

835
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,160
他们的优秀品质 会因此更加闪耀
Their uniqueness enhanced by these.

836
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:20,440
你们齐心协力 万众一心
They were one. You are one.

837
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,310
万众一心
All are one!

838
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,950
等等 我们有了…你……你给了我们……
Wait. We have... You... You gave us...

839
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:43,460
改变世界的能力
The ability to change your world.

840
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:48,630
如何发挥这份能力 取决于你们自己了
How you choose to use that power is up to you.

841
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:54,900
他们找到我们了
They've found us.

842
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,610
是的 是时候反击了
Oh, yes! Time to fight back!

843
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,480
不 你们得返回铁堡 把情况告诉所有人
No. You must return to Iacon City and alert everyone.

844
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,980
这里面有我给你们看过的影像
Embedded in this are the records I have shown you.

845
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,450
用它来揭开真相
Use it to reveal the truth.

846
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,820
我们会的
We will.

847
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,950
这条隧道一直通向山坡
This tunnel leads to the mountains.

848
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,820
塞伯坦的未来掌握在你手中
Cybertron's future is in your hands.

849
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,320
没时间了
We're out of time.

850
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,960
我们快走
We got to move!

851
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,730
等等 我们不能把你丢在这里
Wait, we can't just leave you here.

852
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,290
你的战斗马上就会来临 朋友
Your fight will come, my friend.

853
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,670
元始天尊对我们各有安排
Primus has a purpose for us all.

854
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,610
但是这一战……
But this fight...

855
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,510
是属于我的
This fight is mine.

856
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:36,010
快走
Now go!

857
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,430
投降吧 老家伙
Stand down, old timer.

858
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,430
你说我老
Ah. Old, you say?

859
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,220
是你们在我面前太嫩
Not too old for you.

860
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,230
我们得快点
We need to hurry!

861
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,930
我觉得我们这么样跑
I still think we have better odds

862
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,700
还不如和他们拼了胜算更高
fighting than outrunning them.

863
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,740
等等 我们不是有变形齿轮 我们可以变形啊
Wait! We have cogs. We can transform now.

864
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,710
-没错 准备好了么  -我蓄势待发
That's right. Everyone ready? I was born ready.

865
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,370
数到三 一…
On three. One...

866
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,190
这东西怎么用啊
How do we use these things?

867
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,120
我也不知道 只能试试看
I don't know. Just try.

868
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,700
可以了 成功了
It's working. Ha! It's working!

869
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,540
我的头呢
My head! My head!

870
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,440
救命 救命
Help! Help!

871
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,650
这不是更快
This is not faster!

872
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,550
哦 别这样
Oh, come on!

873
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:24,650
现在…变形
And transform!

874
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,690
轮胎 我要轮胎
Wheels! I need wheels!

875
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,660
-我们还活着 -我没那么快过
We're alive! I've never moved that fast.

876
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,460
=太不可思议了 -看到我滑下来吗
That was incredible! Did you see me slide all over?

877
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,910
是的
Yes!

878
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,500
兄弟 你还好吧
Hey, whoa, buddy. You okay?

879
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,180
我很好 开什么玩笑 我们可以变形了
I'm great. Are you kidding me? We can transform!

880
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,350
我们可以变形了
We transform!

881
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,980
我知道啊
Oh, hey! I know.

882
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,090
别浪费时间 我们得回去铁堡
We're wasting time. We have to get back to Iacon.

883
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,280
看起来回去
Looks like the fastest way

884
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,020
最快的方法是… 我懂了
back to Iacon is... Here, I got it.

885
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,520
嘿 你在干嘛
Hey, what are you doing?

886
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,220
别担心 我行的 -小心点
Don't worry, I got it. Yeah, but be careful.

887
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,060
证据在里面 你别弄得到处都是
Our proof is inside and you're spilling it everywhere.

888
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:49,740
我可以的
I... got... it.

889
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,010
好吧
Okay.

890
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,270
跟我来
Follow me.

891
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,380
钛师傅
Alpha Trion!

892
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,220
你还活着 真没想到
You are still alive. Would you look at that?

893
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,030
你看起来很糟糕
You look horrible.

894
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,160
叛徒 你真是可耻
Traitor. You are a disgrace.

895
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,430
元始天尊一定会… 是的 闭嘴
Primus will surely... Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

896
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,240
抓住机会 掌控我的未来
I seized an opportunity to take control of my future.

897
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,710
只要不必替你和无聊的元老会工作就行
Anything to get out of working for you

898
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,070
还有那个无聊的长老会议
and that boring council of elders.

899
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,270
说真的 我宁愿看你们这些元祖金刚
Seriously, I would watch you Primes

900
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,410
要么一天到晚吃败仗
spend half the day losing a war

901
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:38,250
要么围在一起高谈阔论所谓的忠诚与荣誉
and the other half sitting around waxing poetic about loyalty and honor.

902
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,550
现在看看你的下场
And now look at you.

903
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,390
你给我听好了 你们注定会下台
Hear my words: You will fall.

904
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,450
新的领袖将崛起…
And a new Prime will rise...

905
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,990
又在絮絮叨叨了
There you go again.

906
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,930
我不想再听任何大道理
I don't want to listen to any more speeches.

907
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,740
洞里还有其他人
There were others in the cave with you.

908
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,800
他们是谁
Who are they?

909
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,940
他们会是你的克星
They are to be your undoing.

910
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,370
你输定了 御天敌 你无法挽回…
You've lost, Sentinel. Nothing you can do...

911
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,480
我说过我不想听你絮絮叨叨了
Oh, didn't I just say no speeches?

912
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,120
大家都听到吧
You heard me, right?

913
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,550
这就是我最烦的 真不让人省心
This is what I'm talking about. Unbelievable.

914
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,450
他们个个都这样 完全不尊重我
All of them are like that. So disrespectful.

915
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,290
行了 把那几个抓回来
Okay. Hunt down the others.

916
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,630
乐意效劳
With pleasure.

917
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,480
嘿,哥们
Hey, buddy.

918
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,320
你一直没说话 没事吧
You've been a little quiet. Are you all right?

919
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,650
我满脑子都是御天敌那副假笑的表情
All I can think about is Sentinel's smirking face.

920
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:55,490
他必须为他的所作所为付出代价 总得有人做点什么
He must pay for what he's done. Someone has to do something.

921
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,700
我们一起 有了钛师傅的证据 我们就可以让真相公之于众
We are. With Alpha's proof inside that device, we will show everyone the truth.

922
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,810
你真的觉得后面会那么简单吗
You honestly believe it'll be that easy?

923
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,810
铁堡不想知道真相
Iacon doesn't want to hear the truth.

924
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,070
他们崇拜御天敌
They worship Sentinel.

925
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,110
一定有更好的办法推翻他
There's got to be a better way to bring him down.

926
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,810
我们得相信大家都会相信事实真相
We have to trust everyone will believe what we show them.

927
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,920
我曾经相信御天敌
I trusted Sentinel!

928
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,610
全心全意相信他
With everything.

929
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:22,090
我不会再相信任何所谓的领袖 永远也不会
I will never trust a so-called leader ever again.

930
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,420
我只相信一个人
There's only one bot I know I can trust...

931
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,270
好了 叫醒他们
All right, wake them up.

932
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,460
快说 你们是间谍吗
Now, are you spies

933
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,770
还是一群没用的小跟班
or just incompetent lackeys?

934
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,600
-我们不是间谍 -但他的确挺没用的
We're not spies. But he is incompetent.

935
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,950
扫描电波信号 他说的是实话
Scanning electrical impulses. He speaks the truth.

936
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,510
那只说明他们信念很强 间谍都一样
That just means he believes himself, like any spy would.

937
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,050
为什么他被堵住了嘴
Uh, why is he gagged?

938
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,750
他是个话痨
He wouldn't stop talking.

939
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,290
昏迷的时候也话痨
Even when he was unconscious?

940
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,520
昏迷话痨的更严重
Especially when he was unconscious!

941
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,760
够了
Enough!

942
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,360
给你们两个选择
Two options for you!

943
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,070
第一个 我们慢慢地一个螺帽一个螺丝 把你们每个人拆了
One, we slowly dismantle each of you one bolt and screw at a time,

944
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:42,730
让你们痛不欲生
and really make sure you feel it.

945
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,870
第二
Or two:

946
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,670
你们想死得痛快
In exchange for a quick death,

947
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,110
就要说出能量列车
you give us intel on the Energon trains,

948
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:50,110
通往矿区的道路
access to the mines

949
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:53,820
或是能伤害你们老大御天敌的情报
or anything else that could hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

950
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,350
你们到底是谁
Who exactly are you guys?

951
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,190
塞伯坦至高卫队
The Cybertronian High Guard!

952
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,090
我就说堵得不够紧
I told you it wasn't tight enough!

953
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,230
-铁堡最厉害的守卫者 最厉害
Prestigious defenders of Iacon. Prestigious?

954
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:08,960
他说的对 我在档案库读过你们的事迹
He's right. I read all about you in the archives.

955
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,400
你们是赛博坦最具传奇性的战士
You were the most legendary warriors in all of Cybertron.

956
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,200
看 看 红蜘蛛
Look, look, look! That's Starscream,

957
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,100
你们是震荡波和声波
and you're Shockwave, and Soundwave.

958
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,730
名字中有“波”的举手 好多“波”啊
Raise your hand if "wave" is in your name. There's a lot of "waves."

959
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,310
闭嘴
Silence!

960
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:23,440
超级烦人的小黄人说得对
The yellow annoying one is correct.

961
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,280
我们曾经是至高卫队
We were once the High Guard.

962
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,020
我们亲眼目睹御天敌的背叛和元祖金刚的殒落
We witnessed Sentinel's betrayal, saw the Primes fall.

963
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,920
从那天起 我们就在暗中继续奋战
Since that day, we've been fighting from the shadows,

964
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,650
尽全力破坏御天敌的计划
doing whatever we can to sabotage Sentinel.

965
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,390
太好了 我们…
That's great! We're... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

966
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,100
好啦 没事 大家放轻松
Okay, okay. We're good. Everyone relax.

967
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,590
我只是想说我们是盟友
I'm just saying we're allies.

968
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,660
我们正要回去铁堡的路上
We were on our way back to Iacon,

969
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,730
我们能让赛博坦人同心协力对抗御天敌
and now with your help, we can unify Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.

970
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:53,880
让赛博坦人同心协力的想法是个笑话
The idea of a unified Cybertron is a myth.

971
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,740
只有打倒另一个机器人的力量才算实力
All that counts is the strength of one bot over another!

972
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:03,610
好吧 所以 这些家伙有点极端
Okay. So, these guys are a little intense.

973
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:05,550
是的 会有一点点
Yeah. Just a little.

974
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,490
你在干什么
What are you doing?

975
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,720
我跟你说我不想干嘛
I tell you what I'm not doing.

976
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,660
我不想躲在破烂飞船 假装自己是王者
I'm not cowering in some busted ship, playing king of the throne.

977
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,860
我不想假装挥出一拳
I'm not pretending like I'm making a difference

978
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,600
然后逃走就能改变什么
by throwing one punch and then running away to hide!

979
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,860
我发现御天敌是叛徒
I found out that Sentinel is rotten today,

980
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,870
我要让他付出代价
and I'm gonna make him pay for it.

981
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,370
就在今天
Today!

982
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:31,980
你以为能羞辱我后 一走了之
You think you can insult me and just walk away?

983
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,020
除非我允许 谁也别想离开
No one leaves here unless I say so.

984
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,680
是吗
Is that right?

985
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,850
你怎么能这么说呢
Well, how can you say so

986
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,820
当我用头撞烂你牙齿
with my head in your teeth?

987
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,900
打我啊
Hit me!

988
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,180
打啊 来啊 继续打
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!

989
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:12,880
你们想看一个机器人打倒另一个的力量
You want to see the strength of one bot over another? Huh?

990
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,960
这就是你的全部能耐吗
Is that all you've got, tough bot?

991
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,750
来啊 打啊 快啊
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

992
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,480
拜托!我求你了
Please! I beg you!

993
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,310
住手 D 他不是敌人
Stop! D, he's not the enemy!

994
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,780
大家看好了
Bear witness!

995
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,580
这是我最后一次手下留情
This is the last time I show mercy!

996
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,260
你们现在就做出决定
Decide right now:

997
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:54,890
可以躲在这里 向这个可怜虫卑躬屈膝
You can stay here in hiding, bowing before your pathetic leader,

998
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:58,230
或是追随我向铁堡进军
or follow me as we march on Iacon

999
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:01,800
我会彻底干掉御天敌
and I take down Sentinel once and for all!

1000
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,960
B 来吧
B, come on!

1001
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,760
迎击所有敌人 我去摧毁舰桥
Engage all hostiles! I've got the bridge!

1002
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:37,430
艾丽塔 趴下
Elita, get down!

1003
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:02,690
我感觉被一座悬崖压倒
I feel like someone dropped a cliff on me.

1004
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:05,230
其他人呢
Where are the others?

1005
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,020
御天敌的部队抓走一大堆囚犯
Sentinel's troops took as many prisoners as they could carry.

1006
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,830
D-16和B也被抓走
They got D-16 and B.

1007
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:12,700
噢 不好了
Oh, no.

1008
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,270
还有一半的至高护卫疯子
And half of those High-Guard nutjobs.

1009
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,000
我们的证据
Our proof.

1010
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,440
也没有了
It's gone.

1011
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,580
那现在该怎么办
So, what do we do now?

1012
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,180
D是对的
D was right.

1013
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,780
-关于什么  -所有的一切
About what? Everything.

1014
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:31,420
看看四周 这是一场大灾难
Look at it. Look around. This is a disaster.

1015
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,160
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

1016
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,080
我应该遵守规定
I should have stayed on protocol.

1017
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,760
给我听好 我要你好好听我说
Listen to me. I really want you to hear this.

1018
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,830
你在听吗
Are you listening?

1019
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,830
我比你更强
I'm better than you.

1020
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,470
知道了 我们明白你的意思
Yeah, okay, I'm hearing you.

1021
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,100
我虽然各方面都比你强
I'm better than you in every way,

1022
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,610
但你心怀希望
except you have hope.

1023
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:01,320
一向如此 你会返回矿井救出爵士
You always have. You went back into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1024
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,290
你会偷潜到危险的地表寻找领导模块
You snuck up to the surface to find the Matrix of Leadership.

1025
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,110
是啊 结果不怎么样
Yeah, and how'd that work out?

1026
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,880
我想说的是
My point is,

1027
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,150
你的直觉要你打破规则是有原因的
that your instincts tell you to break protocol for a reason.

1028
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:16,270
正是你盲目的乐观
This blind optimism that you have

1029
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:20,630
才会让你每一次都勇于做出既大胆又勇敢的选择
is why you make such bold and courageous choices,

1030
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,500
虽然也是挺蠢的选择
that are also extremely stupid.

1031
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,070
你应该是第一次安慰人吧
First time giving a pep talk?

1032
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,840
你能振奋人心
You're inspiring.

1033
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,210
你能预见到别人想不出来的 美好未来
You can envision a better future that no one else can see.

1034
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:35,320
如果我们想再见到B和D-16
And if we ever want to see B and D-16 again,

1035
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,350
现在就站起来继续当那个乐观向上的奥利安 派克斯
that is the Orion Pax that we need right now.

1036
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,590
听我说
Listen to me.

1037
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,690
我们可以做到
We can do this.

1038
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:49,360
能量列车会驶回铁堡
Those Energon trains will be heading back to Iacon.

1039
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,090
我们只要拦截到一列…
If we intercepted one...

1040
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:55,300
没问题 我能让它转向 还需要什么
Hell yes, I can reroute it. What else do we need?

1041
01:09:55,300 --> 01:10:00,030
我大条直觉告诉我应该多召募一些疯战友
Well, my bold instincts tell me we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1042
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:04,380
我就怕你会这么说
I was afraid you'd say that.

1043
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,980
震荡波 声波和后面那个
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave. You in the back.

1044
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,250
想要拯救我们的朋友就必须马上行动
In order to save our captured friends, we have to act now.

1045
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,550
我马上就把你轰回铁堡
How about I blast you back to Iacon?

1046
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,990
她直视我的眼睛
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1047
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,230
大家闭嘴 全都听他的话
Everyone, shut up! All of you. Listen to him.

1048
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,060
我们的朋友应该被关在
Most likely, our friends are being held captive

1049
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,730
御天敌的塔顶
at the top of Sentinel's tower.

1050
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,770
突击是拯救他们最好的机会
A surprise attack would give us a chance to rescue them.

1051
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:33,740
不可能 没有足够的士兵 我们也进不去
Impossible. We do not have enough soldiers or a way inside.

1052
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,910
艾丽塔会设法进去 我会找到更多士兵
Elita will get us in. And I will get more troops.

1053
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,550
我们为什么要追随你
Why should we follow you?

1054
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,380
我们会追随你
We will follow you.

1055
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,620
注意 高卫 准备战斗听好了 至高护卫 准备作战
Attention, High Guard. Prepare for battle.

1056
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,650
第一步行动是什么
What is our first move?

1057
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:47,820
我们出发
We roll out.

1058
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:50,430
什么
What?

1059
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:51,860
大声点
Louder.

1060
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,300
变形金刚 出发
Transform and roll out!

1061
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,840
我不明白 为什么我们还活着
I don't understand. Why are we still alive?

1062
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,450
看看这群混混 至高护卫
Look at this rowdy bunch! The High Guard!

1063
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:13,320
知道吗 你们真的很难找
You know, you guys have been tough to find.

1064
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,910
我每次去地表都在寻找你们
Every trip to the surface, I've been searching for you.

1065
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,450
追踪山洞的机器人 让我找到他们
Tracking the bots in the cave led me right to them.

1066
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,720
你抓住了红蜘蛛 这太容易了
You captured Starscream! It was too easy.

1067
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,920
我要把你大卸八块
I'm going to rip you apart piece by piece

1068
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,430
让你痛不欲生
so that your death is painful!

1069
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:28,730
-你会后悔…
You'll regret the day you were...

1070
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,700
你听起来很可笑 还很奇怪
You sound ridiculous. It's weird.

1071
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,730
D-16 你的下场会很惨
Oh, D-16, what a tragic story you'll be.

1072
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:37,640
在你的矿场那么优秀 私底下却是叛徒
Atop the leaderboard in your sector and secretly a traitor.

1073
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,740
我不是叛徒 你才是
I'm not a traitor. You're the traitor.

1074
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,480
不 你们 你们全都是叛徒
Nuh-uh. You, all of you, are traitors.

1075
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,170
你们一直在和五面怪勾结 破坏我的探险
You've been working with the Quintessons to sabotage my expeditions.

1076
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,620
你们害我到现在还没找到领导模块
You're the reason why I haven't found the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1077
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,910
你胡说八道
None of that is true!

1078
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,520
相信我 当我再铁堡当众处决你们
Oh, trust me, it'll be very true

1079
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,460
的时候就不是胡说八道了
when I'm executing you in front of all of Iacon.

1080
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,280
因为在这里 真相是我说了算
Because down here, the truth is what I make it.

1081
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,440
很好 什么情况啊
Well, well. What's this about?

1082
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,000
我才不会向你下跪
I'm not kneeling in front of you.

1083
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,970
你很自信嘛
Feeling confident, are we?

1084
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:18,210
我不怕你 你想知道为什么吗
You don't scare me. You want to know why?

1085
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,310
请说
Please.

1086
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,550
因为我已经没什么可失去的了
Because I don't have anything left to lose.

1087
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,720
你夺走我的一切
You took it all.

1088
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,460
说的没错
I sure did.

1089
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,920
啊 这不是震天尊
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1090
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,400
眼光不错 他是最酷的领袖
Of course you were a fan. Megatronus was the coolest Prime!

1091
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,290
最大 最狠 最强
The biggest! The baddest! The toughest!

1092
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,770
于是我杀了他之后
That's why, after I killed him,

1093
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,040
我把他的变形齿轮占为己有
I took his cog for myself.

1094
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,550
你永远都不会比他更伟大
He was greater than you'll ever be!

1095
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,840
很难说 我也很优秀
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1096
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,720
但我能理解你为什么喜欢他 而不喜欢我
But I can understand why you'd want to wear his face over mine.

1097
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,780
拿去
Here.

1098
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,250
我来确定它不会被弄掉
Let's make sure it doesn't come off.

1099
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,540
好吧
Okay.

1100
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,110
我可以的
I can do this.

1101
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,260
不是吧 我们连续值班二十二班没休息过了
You can't be serious. We just worked 22 shifts without a break!

1102
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,990
矿工也需要休息和维修
These miners need rest and time to repair and...

1103
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,290
御天敌需要更多能量晶体
Sentinel Prime wants more Energon.

1104
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:49,740
给我回去矿场 不然我把你们打回去
So get back in the mines before I make you get back in the...

1105
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,400
-那是谁  -你看到刚才那是谁了吗
Who was that? Did you see who that was?

1106
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,610
不可能是他
That can't be him.

1107
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,710
是……
Is that...

1108
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,410
这不可能
It can't be.

1109
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,950
-奥利安  -爵士
Orion? Jazz.

1110
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,380
真的是你吗
Is it really you?

1111
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,790
是啊 我知道我看起来有点不一样了
Yeah, I know I, uh, look a little different.

1112
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,380
有点
"Little"?

1113
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,220
你现在完全变了
There's nothing "little" about you.

1114
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,090
这是怎么回事
Uh, how is this possible?

1115
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:16,930
御天敌说你比赛受伤去世了
Sentinel told us you died from your race injuries.

1116
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,900
御天敌是个骗子
Sentinel is a liar.

1117
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:21,930
什么
What? Huh?

1118
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:24,100
听着 我知道我这么说可能会有点奇怪
Look, I know how this will sound coming from me.

1119
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,610
我不是个好矿工
I was never the most focused miner.

1120
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,070
正如你们所见 现在一切都变了
But as you can see, everything is different now.

1121
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,150
我去了地表 得知了真相
I went to the surface and I learned the truth.

1122
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,290
朋友们
My friends,

1123
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:49,390
我们每个人与生俱来都有变形齿轮
we were all born with transformation cogs.

1124
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,600
御天敌却把它们夺走了
And then Sentinel, he stole them from us.

1125
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,000
他也夺走我们自己做决定的能力
He took away our ability to make our own decisions.

1126
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,170
他偷走了我们的自由
He stole our freedom.

1127
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:08,820
但现在我要给你们第一个真正的决定权
But now, I'm offering you your first real choice.

1128
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,950
你们可以继续工作23个班 让自己活活累死
You can work a 23rd shift and mine yourself to death

1129
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,480
或是跟我一起反抗御天敌
or fight back against Sentinel with me.

1130
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:20,160
就是现在现在
Right now.

1131
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,530
我们该怎么做呢 我们没有变形齿轮就不能战斗
How are we supposed to do that? We can't fight. We don't have cogs.

1132
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:29,800
成为变形金刚 靠的不是他胸口的变形齿轮
What defines a Transformer is not the cog in its chest

1133
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,770
而是内心深处的那束火种
but the spark that resides in their core.

1134
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,940
给你意志让你的世界变得更美好的火种
A spark that gives you the will to make your world better.

1135
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,810
而那火种 御天敌永远无法从我们这里夺走
And that spark, Sentinel can never take from us.

1136
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:43,210
我们数量不够多 需要一支军团
There's not enough of us. We'd need an army.

1137
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,990
我们已有一支军团 艾丽塔正在召募士兵
And we have one. Elita is bringing troops.

1138
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,050
我们并不孤单
We are not alone in this.

1139
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:51,860
想要掌控自己的命运
If we want to be in control of our own destiny,

1140
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,520
我们必须为此而战
we will have to fight for it.

1141
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,900
现在我们就要勇敢站起来
Now is the time for us to stand up...

1142
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,900
为我们自己奋战
...for ourselves.

1143
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:03,170
为了反抗不公正
Stand up for this injustice.

1144
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:09,070
我向你们保证这绝对值得誓死奋战
I promise you this fight will be worth it.

1145
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,750
追随我
Follow me.

1146
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,650
只要同心协力 什么都无法阻挡我们
Nothing can stop us when we stand together.

1147
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:18,180
万众一心
Together as one.

1148
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:22,690
奥利安 派克斯 奥利安 派克斯
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

1149
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,190
艾丽塔 时间到了
Elita, it's time.

1150
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,520
收到
You got it.

1151
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,800
系好安全带 准备闪亮登场 我们进去
Buckle up, Blinky. We're going in.

1152
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,440
别自寻死路
Not a good idea.

1153
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:47,780
D 趴下
D, stay down.

1154
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,420
那太可惜了
Well, that's a shame.

1155
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,390
你曾是很好的矿工
You really were a great miner.

1156
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,330
遭到攻击 保护御天敌
We've got a breach! Protect Sentinel!

1157
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:22,150
被他们发现了 这会很颠簸
They spotted us. It's about to get bumpy.

1158
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,790
至高护卫 弹射
High Guard, eject.

1159
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,760
快啊 冲吧
Come on! Move out!

1160
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,770
敌人太多了 必须中止行动
There's too many. We have to abort!

1161
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,470
我们死定了
We're not gonna make it.

1162
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:55,920
开足马力 矿工们
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1163
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,680
全力进攻 让我们违反点规定吧
Let's break some protocol!

1164
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,450
我要的就是这个 派克斯
That's what I'm talking about, Pax!

1165
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,360
太夸张了
Whoa! That's intense.

1166
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,070
你赢不了 我啥都看得见
You can't win, miner. I see everything!

1167
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,970
没错 你说得对
That's right, you do.

1168
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,710
但你反面看不到我们正要冲进塔台
Except the tower we're about to crash into.

1169
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,350
怎么回事
What's going on?

1170
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,000
他对你做了什么
What has he done to you?

1171
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,870
这跟我要对御天敌做的事比起来根本不算什么
This is nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1172
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:55,070
声波 松绑囚犯
Soundwave, free the prisoners.

1173
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:02,080
我知道怎么阻止他 答案是黑寡妇
I know how to stop him. Airachnid is the answer.

1174
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,850
-我要用我的方法 -D
I'm doing this my way. D!

1175
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,420
太棒了
Yes!

1176
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,390
我有战斗面罩
I got a battle mask!

1177
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,060
艾丽塔 战斗面罩
Elita! Battle mask!

1178
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:21,030
突然冒出来…
It appeared when this guy tried to...

1179
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:23,070
手刀 我有手刀
Knife hands? I have knife hands!

1180
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:27,140
搞什么
What the...?

1181
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,950
霸道金刚
Badassatron.

1182
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,150
御天敌在哪儿
Where's Sentinel?

1183
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,960
你们这两个无可救药的蠢货
You pathetic little twits.

1184
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:48,290
真以为你们能摧毁我建造的一切
Did you really think that you could knock down everything I've built?

1185
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:52,130
都结束了 御天敌 你逃避不了真相 什么真相
It's over, Sentinel. You can't escape the truth. What truth?

1186
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,840
拔掉了你们与生俱来的变形齿轮
That I plucked the cogs from your newborn chests?

1187
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,040
逼你们采矿 买通五面怪
Forced you to mine so that I could pay off the Quintessons

1188
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,400
过着国王般生活
and live like a king?

1189
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,400
随便你们怎么说 因为这里的真相……
None of that matters! Because the truth...

1190
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:05,410
．.．全部由我做主
...is what I make it.

1191
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:08,510
找掩体
Incoming!

1192
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:17,090
-他太强了 -我有个主意
He's too strong. I have a plan.

1193
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:19,290
-需要抓住黑寡妇 -黑寡妇
We need Airachnid. Airachnid?

1194
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:21,560
-我们需要她的记忆 -她在哪
We need her memory. Where is she?

1195
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,160
她在这里
Found her!

1196
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:25,660
艾丽塔
Elita!

1197
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,940
别弄伤她
Do not break her.

1198
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,270
把她带到广播站去
Bring her to the broadcast station.

1199
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:30,500
我们在那里见
We'll meet you there.

1200
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,470
说得倒轻巧
Easier said than done.

1201
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,790
-我叫你别弄伤她
I said, don't break her!

1202
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,820
听到了 我这会儿很温柔
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1203
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,000
奥利安 快看 我有一对手刀
Orion! Orion, look! I have knife hands!

1204
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,600
我看到了
I can see that.

1205
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,800
我削两个给你看看 过来啊
I'm gonna cut these guys. Watch. Come here!

1206
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,670
晚点再削 我们得走了
You can jab them later. We got to go.

1207
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,560
不好意思 闲人莫入
Uh, excuse me. You can't be in here.

1208
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:46,340
-他们不是坏蛋 -你干嘛劈开门
These are not the bad guys. Why did you cut the door?

1209
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,980
怎么啦 不 我没有……那是……我…
What? No, I didn't... That was an... I...

1210
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,610
我来的时候那样了 对吧?
It was already like that. Right?

1211
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:51,950
是的 没错 没错 是的
Yes, that's right. That's right, yes.

1212
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:54,060
是的 一开始就长这样…是的 嗯哼
Yeah, it was already like... Yes. Mm-hmm.

1213
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,590
注意 铁堡全体居民
Attention, Iacon City.

1214
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:03,970
请准备收看御天敌的直播
Stand by for a live transmission from Sentinel Prime.

1215
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:11,340
怎么了 D-16
What's wrong, D-16?

1216
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,440
起来
Rise up!

1217
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:19,080
所以我杀了他之后
That's why after I killed him...

1218
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:23,220
我杀了他以后 就把他的变形齿轮占为己有
That's why after I killed him, I took his cog for myself.

1219
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,550
占为己有
...cog for myself.

1220
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:29,390
什么真相 我拔掉了你们与生俱来的变形齿轮
What truth? That I plucked the cogs from your newborn chests?

1221
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:31,090
逼你们替我采矿 好让我给五面怪还债
Forced you to mine so that I could pay off

1222
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:32,950
像国王一样生活吗
the Quintessons and live like a king?

1223
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:34,660
什么真相
What truth?

1224
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,590
我拔掉你们天生就有的变形齿轮
That I plucked the cogs from your newborn chests?

1225
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:38,300
逼你们采矿 买通五面怪
Forced you to mine so that I could pay off

1226
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,460
过着国王般生活
the Quintessons and live like a king?

1227
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:42,300
我已经逼矿工卖命工作
I'm working my miners as hard as I can.

1228
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,270
我发誓会把剩下的给你
I swear I will get you the rest!

1229
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,440
我已经逼矿工卖命工作
I'm working my miners as hard as I can.

1230
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,240
我发誓会把剩下的给你
I swear I will get you the rest!

1231
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,610
我已经逼矿工卖命工作 我发誓…
I'm working my miners as hard as I can, I swear...

1232
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,250
骗子!
Liar!

1233
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,910
我们信任你
We trusted you!

1234
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:00,620
叛徒!
Traitor!

1235
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:02,680
派克斯 我们成功了
Pax, we did it.

1236
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,700
我们可以一起领导赛博坦
We can lead Cybertron together!

1237
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,100
别这样
Don't do this!

1238
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,510
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1239
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:58,150
结束了 D
It's over, D.

1240
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:00,310
铁堡居民都知道真相了
Everyone in Iacon knows the truth.

1241
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,970
我也是
So do I!

1242
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:05,150
他夺走了我们的一切 我必须这么做
He took everything from us! I have to do this!

1243
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:06,810
你不必杀他
No, you don't.

1244
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:10,520
不能用一场处决开始重建铁堡
Rebuilding Iacon cannot begin with an execution.

1245
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,050
他死有余辜 难道你不知道
He deserves to die! Can't you see that?

1246
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:16,070
我们比他更好 别变得跟御天敌一样
We're better than this. Don't be like Sentinel.

1247
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:19,730
派克斯…
Pax,

1248
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:23,800
你必须让开 不然我会动手
you need to move out of my way before I move you myself.

1249
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,000
D,听……
D, listen...

1250
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,380
住手
Stop!

1251
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,360
不!
No!

1252
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,430
不 不 不 为什么?
No, no, no, no. Why?

1253
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,860
你为什么那么做 为什么
Why did you do that? Why?

1254
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,970
D 不要
D, no.

1255
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:13,520
我不想再救你了
I'm done saving you.

1256
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:56,460
元祖金刚的时代结束了
The Age of Primes has ended!

1257
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,820
不会再有冒牌先知
No more false prophets!

1258
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:03,090
只要追随我 你们将不会再受骗
Follow me and you will never again be deceived.

1259
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,430
反抗
Rise up!

1260
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,500
反抗 反抗
Rise up! Rise up!

1261
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:11,700
反抗 反抗 反抗
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!

1262
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,070
奥利安 派克斯
Orion Pax,

1263
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:17,200
你牺牲小我完成大我的高贵情操
your noble sacrifice for the greater good

1264
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,250
证明了你在元始天尊眼中的价值
has proven you worthy in the eyes of Primus.

1265
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,520
他托付给你
He entrusts in you

1266
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,420
塞伯坦的未来
the future of Cybertron

1267
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:33,050
以及领导模块
and the Matrix of Leadership!

1268
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,660
我将带领大家走向未来
I will lead us all into the future!

1269
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,750
我…
I...

1270
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,580
叫…
am...

1271
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:00,290
威震天!
Megatron!

1272
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,920
崛起吧
Arise...

1273
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:06,050
擎天柱
Optimus Prime.

1274
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,930
把它摧毁
Burn it down!

1275
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,930
全部
All of it!

1276
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:21,510
威震天万岁
All hail Megatron!

1277
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:25,910
他会杀了所有人 我们必须阻止他 来吧
He's gonna kill everyone. We have to stop him. Come on.

1278
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:29,110
住手 结束了
Stop! It's over.

1279
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:32,880
他所有的爪牙都死了才算结束
It's over when every last one of his followers is dead!

1280
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,820
不可能的
Impossible.

1281
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:14,350
元始天尊把领导模块交给你
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1282
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:16,560
我们本可以一起创造未来
We could've built the future together.

1283
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,600
我会亲手建造未来
I'll build it myself.

1284
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,200
谁敢挡我的路就得死
After I tear down everyone in my way!

1285
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:10,140
我们被赋予了改变世界的力量
We were given the power to change our world

1286
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,650
而你却选择了毁灭它
and you chose to destroy it.

1287
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,110
就像御天敌一样
Just like Sentinel.

1288
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:17,980
你背叛了赛博坦和所有居民
You have betrayed Cybertron and its citizens.

1289
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,450
背叛了我
And you betrayed me.

1290
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,600
走吧
Go.

1291
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,130
带着至高护卫离开
Take the High Guard and leave.

1292
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:42,970
你被逐出铁堡
You are banished from Iacon.

1293
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:50,180
事情不必变成这样
It didn't have to end this way.

1294
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:55,990
这还没完 擎天柱
This isn't over, Prime.

1295
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:05,900
至高护卫 跟我走
High Guard, follow me!

1296
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:22,050
敌友之间的界线
The line between friend and enemy

1297
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,210
不像我曾相信的那么清楚
is not as clear as I once believed.

1298
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:29,150
一旦跨越界线 就再也无法回头
Once it's crossed, there's no going back.

1299
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:33,190
有些改变永远不能恢复
Because some transformations are permanent.

1300
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,060
震天尊元祖金刚 帅啊
Hey, Megatronus Prime. Nice.

1301
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:37,230
对啊 他是我的偶像
Oh, yeah. Well, he's my hero.

1302
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:39,060
史上最伟大的元祖金刚
The greatest Prime to ever live.

1303
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,560
-我是D-16 -我是奥利安 派克斯
I'm D-16. Orion Pax.

1304
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,970
-你开采过能量晶体吗  -没有
You ever mine Energon before?

1305
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,370
-你呢
No. You?

1306
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:49,580
-没有 听说很危险
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1307
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,680
好吧 不如这样
Well, I'll tell you what.

1308
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:54,210
你挺我 我也一定会挺你
You watch my back, I promise to watch yours.

1309
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,410
好啊
All right.

1310
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,250
谢了 派克斯
Thanks, Pax.

1311
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,590
塞伯坦迎来了新的开始
A new beginning for Cybertron.

1312
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,700
也迎来了新的领袖
And a new leader.

1313
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,710
对了 说到这个
Yes, about that.

1314
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,710
我正巧需要一个帮手 需要一个各方面都比我强的人
I could use some help from a bot who is better than me in every way.

1315
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,680
说我吗 不用了
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1316
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,080
我在垃圾管理部门干得挺开心的
I have a pretty sweet gig working in waste management.

1317
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,080
那么 队长 不如我帮你升一次职
Well, Captain, I do owe you a promotion.

1318
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,850
艾丽塔少校怎么样
How's Major Elita sound?

1319
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:35,420
我更喜欢指挥官
How about Commander?

1320
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,380
正合我意
Even better.

1321
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:41,360
抱歉 B 但我不能让你回到地下五十层
And I'm sorry, B, but I cannot let you go back to sublevel 50.

1322
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,190
虽然我是领袖
I may be a Prime now,

1323
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:44,930
但我需要你在我身边
but I'm gonna need you by my side.

1324
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:48,430
你是认真的吗  这是我人生中最棒的一天
Are you serious? This is the greatest day of my life.

1325
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,630
我终于可以又为星球效力
I get to work for the government.

1326
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:54,270
好吧 这是第一回的
Okay. So that's new.

1327
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:55,940
不好意思 这是怎么了
I'm sorry, what is happening?

1328
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:30,110
如今我们并肩而立 团结一心
And now we stand here together as one...

1329
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:35,640
事实证明我们都有变形的能力
proving we all have the power to transform,

1330
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,890
成为我们注定要成为的人
to become who we were destined to be,

1331
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:43,580
修正错误 让我们的世界更美好
to right wrongs, to make our world better.

1332
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:46,760
因为在这里 自由自主的生活
Because here, freedom and autonomy

1333
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,490
是所有众生的权利
are the rights of all sentient beings.

1334
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:55,070
在这里 所有人 都是真正的汽车人
Here, all are truly Autobots.

1335
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:00,140
这条信息是对五面怪的警告
This message is a warning to all Quintessons.

1336
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:05,540
如果你胆敢再回到塞伯坦 汽车人不会再坐以待毙
If you dare return to Cybertron, the Autobots will be waiting.

1337
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,480
我 严阵以待
I will be waiting.

1338
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,310
我 就是擎天柱
I am Optimus Prime.

1339
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:18,460
变形金刚：起源

1340
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,670
伙计们 好消息 能量晶体回来了
Hey, guys! Great news, the Energon's back!

1341
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,950
我有变形齿轮 我可以变形
And I have a cog and I can transform!

1342
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,890
说来话长 我以后再告诉你
It's a long story. I'll fill you in later.

1343
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:50,450
最棒的是 我有两把手刀
Oh! And here's the best part. My hands are straight-up knives.

1344
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:52,290
看好 手刀出鞘
Watch this. Knife hands!

1345
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,230
不
No!

1346
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:23,970
御天敌那个叛徒死了
Sentinel the betrayer is dead.

1347
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:27,710
但他的死产生一个全新的敌人
But his death has given life to a new enemy.

1348
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:29,910
更强大的敌人
A stronger enemy.

1349
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:32,040
跟我有私人恩怨的敌人
A personal enemy.

1350
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:37,360
我们不会受到他的谎言蒙骗
We will not be blinded by his deception.

1351
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,020
我们是…
We are the ones who are...

1352
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:42,860
霸天虎
Decepticons!

1353
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,690
反抗
Rise up!

1354
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:48,190
反抗 反抗
Rise up! Rise up!

1355
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Merged by Ricco
