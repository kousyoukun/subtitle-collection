19
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,530
Jasmine?

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,250
Jasmine! We gonna be late, come on.

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,410
Let's go.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,170
Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,230
Something's going on right in our face.

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,400
You're so stuck on those iPhones,

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,800
Jphone 12s or whatever,

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,640
blow up in your hand.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,850
You can't Google what's going on right now.

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,390
Are y'all paying attention?

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,900
Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,320
Why?

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,610
They here to clean this water?

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,240
When this water been dirtier than the Devil's mouth for 50 years.

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,120
And now they want to clean it?

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,870
They got plans for us, man.

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,890
Looking like George Jetson rejects.

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,130
'Cause they weak!

38
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,300
Weak hearts!

39
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,670
Weak lungs!

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,130
Can't even breathe up here without a mask.

41
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,720
But we was put through hell to be purified.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
You know what I'm sayin', brothers and sisters?

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,060
Man, it's crazy what jail will do to a nigga.

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,370
They don't care about their water, man,

45
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,460
there's something going on,

46
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,320
we gonna get to the bottom of it.

47
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,050
And they lucky I'm a man of God right now.

48
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,010
You think he rehearses this every morning?

49
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,160
Or they would catch these hands.

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,870
Seems a bit more impromptu.

51
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,760
2019 out here!

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,390
We been yellin' about this water

53
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,170
since before they were born.

54
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,250
Before they were born!

55
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,050
Where's this bus, man? We're not gonna make it.

56
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,390
Y'all leave us the hell alone.

57
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,800
Unless y'all really here to help us.

58
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,060
We'll get there.

59
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,280
They got plans for us, man.

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,410
We're not gonna make it, bro.

61
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,790
Not for you and me.

62
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,200
So I urge you!

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,940
Fight for your land!

64
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,690
Fight for your home!

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,240
- Fight for your... - Let's skate.

66
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,960
This here?

67
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,880
This is the edge, bro!

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,420
The final frontier of Manifest Destiny.

70
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,840
Last edge of the city.

71
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,530
Man, two steps further,

72
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,180
you'll be drinking that filthy saltwater.

73
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,730
But we built these ships.

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,770
Dredged these canals.

75
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,820
In the San Francisco they never knew existed.

76
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,500
And now they come to build something new?

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,090
Whole blocks half in the past, half in the future.

78
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,680
But should you venture into their San Francisco,

79
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,010
the one they pillaged for gold!

80
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,260
Remember your truth!

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,680
In the city of facades.

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,940
Take me with you!

83
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,360
Take me with you, man!

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,990
Come on, where are we going?

85
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,410
Where are we going?

86
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,330
Come on, I'm coming! I'm coming!

87
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,800
Look at them look at you.

88
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,380
Look down at you.

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,760
But we built them!

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,470
We are these homes!

91
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,810
Their eyes...

92
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,310
Their pointed brims...

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,980
We move if they move.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,360
Our sweat soaked in the wood.

95
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,160
Gilded in our image.

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,540
This is our home!

97
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,460
Our home!

98
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,170
Our home.

99
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,760
Thanks.

100
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,850
Are you sure they're gone?

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,780
Jim?

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
I mean, their car is gone.

103
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,500
Let's check the back, man.

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,760
Good morning.

105
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,830
How are you?

106
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,550
Remember that time they were in the kitchen?

107
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,800
Jim!

108
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,430
Remember the kitchen?

109
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,970
Yeah, sure.

110
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,760
But, bro...

111
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,390
Didn't I tell you these railings are periwinkle, not black.

112
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,650
Yeah, I got it.

113
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,530
We gotta start coming more than every two weeks, bro.

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,040
This fuckin' garden's a nightmare.

115
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,460
I'll bring my grandpa's tools next time.

116
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,040
Please do.

117
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,850
Wallpaper's chipping.

118
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,930
These people are killing this house.

119
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,910
You're not goin' in though.

120
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,850
Jim?

121
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,230
I mean...

122
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,070
I mean...

123
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,400
No?

124
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,780
They're definitely gone, though.

125
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,030
Better be quick this time.

126
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,080
Yeah, I know.

127
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,750
Takes time.

128
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,710
Yeah, I know.

129
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,540
I'll be at my spot.

130
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,130
All right.

131
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,630
Quick.

132
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,170
Okay.

133
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,680
- Jesus, man! - Honey.

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,350
Just get the heck out of here, man.

135
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,100
- What the fuck? - He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

136
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,560
He's painting the house now?

137
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
Well, yeah.

138
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,420
Stop fixing my house!

139
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,260
I'm almost done, just hold on.

140
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,650
Why don't you just paint the neighbors' houses?

141
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,050
Theirs are worse than ours.

142
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,780
Just hold on one second.

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,220
I mean, we appreciate it,

144
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,030
in some way, but, yeah...

145
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,330
It's weird, man!

146
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,650
I'm almost done.

147
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,290
Look, we will call the cops, man.

148
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,580
And I mean it this time.

149
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,880
No, we're not gonna call the cops.

150
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,300
We're not calling the cops, just stop coming back.

151
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,370
I'm almost done, hold on, please, hold on.

152
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,040
Just get off my fucking birdie bath.

153
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,890
- No, just... - Get outta here, man.

154
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,000
- Those were $3. - Fine.

155
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,890
I'll finish it next time.

156
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,230
- God! - Next time?

157
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,670
Just get...

158
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,100
Get the heck off my birdie bath!

159
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,090
Just water the plants in the back or I will.

160
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,140
Bro! You were supposed to be the lookout!

161
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,680
You were the one that was so worried.

162
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,140
I got distracted.

163
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,730
Bro!

164
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,270
What if OG is right though?

165
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,940
You really gotta stop eating the fish out there.

166
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,440
I think it's fine.

167
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,320
All fish has mercury.

168
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,160
I know, but I saw a seagull with a dick, bro.

169
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,700
Well, so I guess it's a male.

170
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,620
No, like, bro, like a human dick.

171
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,980
Nasty-ass tumbleweave. Pussy.

172
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,640
- Wild, bro. - Wassup, nigga?

173
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,770
- Ain't tryin' do nothin'. - Scuff my shoes up, huh?

174
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,170
I ain't tryin' do that bullshit...

175
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,310
{\an8}Stop playin' before I slap the shit out your face.

176
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,920
Man, shut your ass up, nigga.

177
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,530
All right, I ain't finna chase you, you play too much, bro.

178
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,820
You lucky I don't beat your ass out here, bro.

179
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,070
Kofi!

180
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,780
- What's good, brother? - What's up with y'all?

181
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,100
You know I seen Moms last night, right?

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
She was looking like she was missing a little bit on the top.

183
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,770
I mean we shower in the same water, Jim.

184
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,870
So niggas takin' showers together now?

185
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,490
Probably was.

186
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,830
That's fruity.

187
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,100
I was trying to tell him not to eat the fish,

188
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,730
because the water is toxic.

189
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,800
That's 'cause they built the atomic bomb right there, nigga.

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,020
I don't think that's true.

191
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,020
What'd he say?

192
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,790
Damn. First thing, that's true.

193
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,710
Bro, them shoes ain't true,

194
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,150
I know your Jesus-lookin' ass ain't talkin', bro.

195
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,800
- Them things is phony. - They're definitely phony.

196
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,340
What about cuz, man?

197
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,550
You was supposed to call me last night.

198
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,550
- What happened with... - Oh, yeah, dude is a cat.

199
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,200
You see his hair, he might be a cheetah.

201
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,190
Can I help you?

202
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,050
I'd like to see the man in charge.

203
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,400
In here.

204
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,610
He's walking him into the Chief's office.

205
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,090
Oh, dear.

206
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,350
I want to report a murder.

207
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,520
- Sit down. - Now, who's that?

208
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,310
Edgar O'Ryan.

209
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,740
Where was this murder committed?

210
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,810
- Edmund O'Brien. - San Francisco.

211
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Him, yeah, yeah.

212
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,400
Who was murdered?

213
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,450
I was.

214
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,830
What?

215
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,700
- How? - Just watch it.

216
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,540
I don't have very much time.

217
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,100
Hand me my beer, son.

218
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,590
Yes, sir.

219
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,430
O'Brien is smoking a cigarette in his office.

220
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,850
- Secretary's perched. - She pretty?

221
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,230
- Yeah? - I'd say... I'd say she is.

222
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,650
You dog.

223
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,570
Hey, Mont!

224
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,110
Montgomery!

225
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,330
How do I get their old croissant-throwing asses out of the house?

226
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,080
What if I peed on their table?

227
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,340
Like, what if I climbed up the birdie bath,

228
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,300
broke in and just peed all over that stupid little yellow table?

229
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,390
Wouldn't that ruin the floors?

230
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah, I guess you got a point there.

231
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,160
You think they'd let me live there as, like,

232
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,830
a caretaker for the house?

233
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,710
No.

234
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,380
That's fucked up.

235
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,400
I mean, I take pretty good care of the house, I think so at least.

236
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,510
Yeah, you do.

237
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,010
We like having you here, Jim.

238
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,810
I know, bro.

239
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,680
But...

240
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,150
You know there's no place like home.

241
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,110
Yeah.

242
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,190

Sir.

257
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,950
Yeah.

258
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,420
All right?

259
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,590
Small guy.

260
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,720
He's perfect.

261
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,680
You get any writing done this morning?

262
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,770
Writing is rewriting.

263
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,570
It's all part of the process.

264
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,360
Yeah, you got it, though.

265
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,030
Yeah, man.

266
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,560
What the f...

267
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,730
Y'all been here 12 years,

268
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,900
still can't take care of this house.

269
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,290
Hey, Paul.

270
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,880
I got you.

271
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,010
Eat your banana.

272
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,880
Fuck you.

273
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,390
You're a nice man.

274
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,390
You're a nice woman.

275
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,560
But I don't know you.

276
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,900
Well, yeah.

277
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,230
You know me pretty well, actually.

278
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,030
But you aren't my husband.

279
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,120
You're a little too young for me.

280
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,580
I am young.

281
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,580
I'm always young.

282
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,380
You're a nice man.

283
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,010
Thank you.

284
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,380
You're a nice woman.

285
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,030
You old marshmallow, cream puff ass,

286
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,490
candied yam-ass nigga, cream puff-ass nigga.

287
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,180
Shut up, bitch, bro.

288
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,060
You bitch. Hold this shit.

289
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
I should snatch your one-ass dread,

290
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,230
lookin' like a fuckin' Rastafarian sperm.

291
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,380
You got me fucked up.

292
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,920
We got you fucked up! We did!

293
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
That's all you gotta say?

294
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,510
Man, what I'm supposed to do, take off?

295
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,720
I don't care about none of that shit.

296
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,430
I know, I just ain't got nothin' else to say.

297
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,310
Man, I put that on a fact, that this nigga's a bitch, man.

298
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,040
Is that sure, man. Man, fuck this nigga.

299
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,750
'Sup, nigga?

300
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,590
'Sup, nigga?

301
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,100
'Sup, nigga?

302
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
How are you, nigga?

303
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,890
I hope she's not home.

304
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,390
That garden...

305
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,690
We have so much to do.

306
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,540
We have to rake it.

307
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,790
We have to weed it.

308
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,070
- We have to... - Jim.

309
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,780
Isn't that the car you used to live in?

310
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,710
Oh, God.

311
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,780
Jimmie!

312
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,370
What up, filth-smellin' motherfucker?

313
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,830
Do you need a ride?

314
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,590
Jimmie!

315
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,430
What's happenin', baby?

316
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,760
Get your young, old-looking ass in the car.

317
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,310
Daddy face.

318
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,660
Jimmie!

319
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,870
Oh, my God, where is this bus?

320
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,330
Man, if you don't get your up

321
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,770
the father from Good Times shirt-wearing ass in this car...

322
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,710
You really gonna ride in the bus with a shovel?

323
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,030
Get your farming ass in this car.

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,950
Jimmie the farmer with your bitch ass.

325
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,080
Come on, laugh a little bit, Jimmie, shit.

326
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,130
Still the same.

327
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,340
Yep, I like what you and your dad did with it.

328
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,760
So much you drove off with it?

329
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,940
No, I borrowed it, I didn't, just, come on...

330
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,720
I drove off with it... I borrowed it, shit.

331
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,720
Matter of fact, I seen your dad the other day.

332
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,600
He was good and lonely.

333
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,060
By hisself.

334
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,690
Okay.

335
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,250
I told him you need to get you a cat or a dog,

336
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,190
or woman or something, nigga, damn.

337
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,460
He's home alone...

338
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,030
Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

339
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,620
He's alone with no home.

340
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,910
Well, you live in a car by yourself.

341
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,290
Yeah, but I... But I'm not alone.

342
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,290
People like me.

343
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,300
I'm liked.

344
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,300
Lonely ass nigga.

345
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,680
When the last time you hung out with your daddy?

346
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,310
Couple weeks ago, I dunno.

347
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,690
Couple weeks ago? The nigga needs you today.

348
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,820
Shit.

349
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,000
That's what... That's what people have kids for,

350
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,740
so they can have some companionship!

351
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,320
Somebody to hang out with.

352
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,370
That's why I ain't had no kids.

353
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,200
'Cause I don't wanna be bothered.

354
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,210
Your daddy don't want this fuckin' car, man.

355
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,460
Wasn't that the Savoy House?

356
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,380
Sure was.

357
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,010
It was 100 motherfuckers in there, rent-controlled.

358
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,840
They thought they owned that shit.

359
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,430
The landlord burned all of the people outta there.

360
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,520
'Cause see, Jimmie,

361
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,640
you never really own shit.

362
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,480
This car ain't mine.

363
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,360
But it never was yours.

364
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,240
You never own shit!

365
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,090
What the fuck?

366
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,610
What's goin' on, man?

367
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,060
No se, bro.

368
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,340
Sir...

369
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,000
What's... What's going on?

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,480
Oh, God.

371
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,400
She's moving.

372
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,690
Fighting like crazy with her sister.

373
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,790
When someone dies in the family,

374
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,610
that's what white people do.

375
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,240
This is for her, this is for him, this is mine.

376
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,200
Who's gonna have the house?

377
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,040
So they lost the house?

378
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,660
Who's gonna possess the house?

379
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,310
They're just fighting, and fighting, and fighting.

380
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,540
What's gonna happen to it now?

381
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,000
Why'd they have to move out 'cause her mom died?

382
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,310
I don't know.

383
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,590
They were tasteless,

384
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,720
but at least they didn't fuck it up.

385
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,620
Well, that will be $10, hun.

386
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,660
Since when?

387
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,730
Since that's the best deal you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

388
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,860
I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie. I said 16.

389
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,040
How I'm gonna eat 60 Twix?

390
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,490
I don't know your life.

391
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,610
You act like you in Costco or something like that.

392
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,040
You ain't Costco.

393
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,350
You can go to Costco if you need to.

394
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,060
- You Rosco. - Go right now.

395
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,340
Sixteen, first time you had...

396
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,600
Jim. Jim.

397
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,560
Jim.

398
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,910
Jim?

399
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,920
So, gentlemen.

400
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,590
What can I do for you?

401
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,980
Yeah, we're curious about a house

402
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,050
on Golden Gate near Fillmore.

403
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,400
It's 959.

404
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,740
It's the gray, it's got the gold trim.

405
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,510
Yup, yup.

406
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,840
Yup, with the, um...

407
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,520
The witch hat.

408
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,140
Yeah, exactly.

409
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,500
Yeah!

410
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
I know exactly what you're talking about,

411
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,070
that place is very special.

412
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,130
I used to drive past that house on the way to school every day.

413
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,750
What school did you go to?

415
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,710
I went to St. Ignatius.

416
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,890
You from here, too?

418
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,630
Yeah, third generation, I went to Reardon, actually.

419
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,320
Really?

420
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,980
Yeah, we used to play y'all in football all the time.

421
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,600
Fuck you, you used to kill us in football.

422
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,810
I didn't wanna say that, but...

424
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,740
That's awesome, right on.

425
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,900
But, so, it's for sale? I didn't hear about that.

426
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,970
Well, I'm not sure.

427
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,760
It seems like the owner and her sister

428
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,260
are fighting over it.

429
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,460
But I guess her mom died.

430
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,040
Man.

431
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,410
I don't know, that sounds like an estate thing.

432
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,640
That's a sucky situation.

433
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,980
But, I mean...

434
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,290
With a house like that,

435
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,020
they could be fighting over that for years.

436
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,460
While it just sits there.

437
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
It's a pity.

438
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,340
So it's really just... just empty?

439
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,970
It's fucked up, right?

440
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,520
So fucked up, like I...

441
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,140
Bothers me, there's all these people in the street

442
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,760
and these big old houses

443
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,880
are just sitting there collecting dust.

444
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,270
But shit, what else can you say?

445
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,760
The fucking injustice of it!

446
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,490
Yeah.

447
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,660
Mont! We here, baby!

448
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,670
Spoiling all the fun,

449
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,360
leveling most of this neighborhood

450
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,890
in the name of Urban Renewal.

451
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,060
Sorry about your homes and your funky shops.

453
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,190
You can set up a shoeshine stand

454
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,580
in front of the parking lot at Safeway.

455
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,840
But you distinguished truth-seekers

456
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,340
want to know about the real hep cats who hung out here,

458
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,550
in the "Harlem of the West,"

459
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,420
where a few of these homes did survive.

460
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,160
Like this beauty here,

461
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,450
which was built clear back in the 1800s.

462
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,290
Before the black thing,

463
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,140
this was all Japanese,

465
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,820
till FDR's stormtroopers rounded them up into camps.

466
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,760
This house was built in the 1940s.

467
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,120
Say Hi to our neighbor here, everybody.

468
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,910
Hi.

469
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,410
That would actually be about 100 years late for this style.

470
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,650
We can see from his gingerbread trim,

471
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,570
this was built sometime in the 1850s.

472
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,830
1946!

473
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,620
I'm gonna have to disagree with you there, dude man.

474
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,910
No architect in the 1940s was building in this style.

475
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,200
That's probably true, but this wasn't built by an architect.

476
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,960
My grandfather built this.

477
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,370
He came here World War II,

478
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,120
he bought this lot and he built this house.

479
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,680
The stairs.

480
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,500
These windows.

481
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,720
The columns. The archways.

482
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,820
The witch hat.

483
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,450
The balustrades.

484
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,690
The fish scales.

485
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,900
This balcony.

486
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,010
That wall to keep y'all the fuck out.

487
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,110
All of it.

488
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,880
By Jimmie Fails I, with his own two hands. In 1946.

489
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,300
That's pretty amazing.

490
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,070
Let's move on to our next stop.

491
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,990
The closet Patty Hearst

492
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,400
willfully hid herself in, before trotting on down...

493
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,960
What's good with that? What's going on?

494
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,080
Feel like the King of England.

495
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,980
King Jimmie. Wave.

496
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,580
Wave to the General.

497
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,320
- Hey, General. - Yeah, but it's like a circle,

498
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,410
with your... with your elbow.

499
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,230
Yeah, and then cup the air.

500
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,300
That's kind of the thing there.

501
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,490
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah, that's good.

502
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,440
It's a beautiful house, Jimmie.

503
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,790
More beautiful than I could have imagined.

504
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,130
Yeah.

505
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,800
It's not quite there yet.

506
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,910
I mean, enough Dickens.

507
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,860
Charles Dickens.

508
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,590
Philistines, bro.

510
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,920
Proust!

512
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,290
Plath!

514
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,210
Hughes!

515
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,280
Jimmie! Langston Hughes!

516
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,740
They left him!

517
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,270
Bro!

518
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,520
Philistines!

519
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,700
Mont.

520
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,960
Mont.

521
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,530
Wake up.

522
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,840
Got a plan.

523
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,650
It's crazy.

524
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,390
Last time I was here, these weeds was taller than me.

525
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,570
She's expecting us?

526
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,920
Yes, sir.

527
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,870
- Auntie! - Jimmie!

528
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,770
Yes!

529
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,320
So good to see you!

530
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,920
- You look good! - Thank you.

531
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,490
- Hey! - This is Mont.

532
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,540
Nice to meet you.

533
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,170
Y'all not hot? Like, you want...

534
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,960
- It's hot as hell out here. - Take your jacket off.

535
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,020
Ain't nobody gonna steal your jacket.

536
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,030
This is a nice neighborhood.

537
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,490
Man, he better not break my damn board.

538
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,790
Shut up.

539
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,750
You should be thanking him.

540
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,400
He's the one that helped me pick out that board.

541
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,810
And besides...

542
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,100
Sometimes it's just nice to watch.

543
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,910
Ricky, do that trick you used to do, baby.

544
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,240
Nice, baby.

545
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,770
Y'all hella cute.

546
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,460
Thank you.

547
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,860
So,

548
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,550
how much of this stuff do you still have?

549
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,360
Really?

550
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,830
How much of this stuff do you have?

551
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,000
You just, no segue or nothin'?

552
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,730
You just came to see the stuff, huh?

553
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,020
Auntie...

554
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,830
I got my first place.

555
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,900
Really?

556
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,620
In the city?

557
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,990
In the city.

558
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,380
Look at you!

559
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,620
Y'all must be doing pretty well to afford a spot there.

560
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,570
Yeah, we got lucky.

561
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,120
It's super empty, though.

562
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,670
Your daddy didn't send you here, right?

563
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,950
- No. - You sure?

564
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,470
I swear to God.

565
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,200
'Cause I hope he's done dragging you into his schemes.

566
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,900
Auntie, this is for us.

567
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,190
Okay.

568
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,660
Okay.

569
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm proud of you, Jayboe.

570
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,430
- Really am. - Thank you.

571
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,650
I miss that city.

572
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,490
You still look good though, baby.

573
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,210
You still look good!

574
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,180
Oh, my goodness.

575
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,700
Damn, I knew you had some of it, but is this everything?

576
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,360
Everything your dad didn't smoke up.

577
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,640
Sorry, came out a little harsh.

578
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,040
I'm fine.

579
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,620
You really got all of this.

580
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,330
Yep!

581
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,780
Got as much as I could.

582
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,580
Open that.

583
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,010
That's amazing.

584
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,820
Yeah, I knew that,

585
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,390
out of everybody in this family,

586
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,930
you would be the one that come looking for this stuff.

587
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,630
So...

588
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,830
I can...

589
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,330
Everything?

590
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,890
It's yours.

591
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,140
- Thank you. - Hell, yeah.

592
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,030
Ricky, get the truck!

593
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,040
You guys good back there?

594
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,180
Bye.

595
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,530
Thank you.

596
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,250
So, Ricky never lived in the house?

597
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,590
No, Wanda didn't meet him

598
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,700
until after we lost it.

599
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,070
- Hello, sir. - Hey!

600
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,300
I'm Jimmie Fails, we haven't had the chance to meet yet.

601
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,500
- Yeah. - Yeah.

602
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,350
Welcome to the neighborhood.

603
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,150
Yeah, oh, yes...

604
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,560
Welcome.

605
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,270
Tim! Tim Ellory.

606
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,850
Sure, sure, nice to meet you, man.

607
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,690
It's a fast-moving market,

608
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,700
I don't even remember a sign going up.

609
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,330
It didn't need to, but...

610
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,910
Look, Tim, I want you to know

611
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,370
I'm going to be the best damn neighbor you ever had.

612
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,950
Well...

613
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,900
- All right, Jimmie, thank you. - My pleasure.

614
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,930
Well, you'll have to pardon me,

615
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,640
we've got lots to do, but...

616
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,660
- Of course, oh, yeah. - Very nice to meet you, yeah.

617
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,240
What the fuck was that all about?

618
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,020
I wanna drink my coffee

619
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,360
and scratch my ass while I read the paper.

620
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,960
You don't read the paper, Jimmie.

621
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,880
'Cause I never had a home to read it in.

622
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,810
Shit.

623
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,150
We could throw parties.

624
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
You could put on one of your plays.

625
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,060
We could yell.

626
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,700
- The neighbors, Jimmie. - Oh, the neighbors?

627
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,620
I got neighbors now.

628
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,900
Attaboy.

629
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,460
This nigga is a bitch.

630
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,600
I'm a soft nigga. Run the fake, nigga!

631
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,940
On everything, bro.

632
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,980
Man, this kid was a straight sucker.

633
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,000
You lyin', bro,

634
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,470
on everything, bro, straight sucker, bro.

635
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,220
- Tell him what happened. - I swear to God.

636
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,370
Man, last night, a white van pulled up.

637
00:41:59,370 --> 00:41:59,710
I swear to God, bro.

638
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,300
This nigga Kofi ran like a straight bitch!

639
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,290
- He not lyin'! - He gonna get us killed!

640
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,340
You niggas sayin' I ran? I didn't run, nigga!

641
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,050
Man, fuck what you niggas talkin' about.

642
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,580
Shut the fuck up, bro, he's a straight sucker, bro.

643
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,290
Man, he got us looking like bitches, bro.

644
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,290
If I've gotta get on this thing,

645
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,380
I'm gonna be questioning you!

646
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,410
You supposed to be my cousin.

647
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,330
I'mma bet you supposed to not run, nigga,

648
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,460
and that's what you supposed to do.

649
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,390
All right, all right, all right, all right, bro.

650
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,520
All right, everybody shut up, bro.

651
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,900
All right, everybody shut up, bro.

652
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,450
Kofi, what happened, bro?

653
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,030
Tell him.

654
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,300
Why?

655
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,700
- Tell him! - Did you run, nigga?

656
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,630
Nah, I didn't run, nigga.

657
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,790
I told you!

658
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,330
- Lyin', lyin'. - Man, fuck you, nigga.

659
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,710
Get on him!

660
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,480
- Hit me, bro. - Man, what?

661
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,170
Hit me, bro.

662
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,490
Hit me, bro.

663
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,190
And for what, you supposed to be my folks.

664
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,080
Kofi, hit that nigga, bro.

665
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,690
Yeah! Come on, bro!

666
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,930
Yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Get on him!

667
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,860
Hit me, bro! Hit me, bro!

668
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,280
This nigga's a bitch!

669
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,050
Hit me, man! Come on!

670
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,910
Guys! Guys!

671
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,930
Great, it's great.

672
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,790
Very good, very good.

673
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,460
Cut! Very good, very good.

674
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,100
Good, good, excellent.

675
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,800
Good. Hey, great news

676
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,510
is you're all doing marvelous work.

677
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,120
- What? - Congratulations,

678
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,420
it's not easy.

679
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,230
I believe you.

680
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,800
But I know it can be deeper.

681
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,900
Fuck you talkin' about?

682
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,710
Remember Stanislavski.

683
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,090
Fuck are you doin', man?

684
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,940
Grotowski or Slavski...

685
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,700
Chekhov, bruh.

686
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,160
- These are the greats. - I'm confused, bro.

687
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,450
You're okay there.

688
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,780
You're okay there.

689
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,660
Bro, you're not a director, bro.

690
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,780
Man, take your weird ass outta here.

691
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,610
Keep building it.

692
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,690
Nigga, I don't like when that nigga come around here, bro.

693
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,660
Bro, this nigga's a bitch.

694
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,750
Say the word, I get on this nigga, bro!

695
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,370
Here we go.

696
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,370
Watch this for me real quick, bro.

697
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,880
I know.

700
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,930
I seen your cousin, Al, the other day.

701
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,640
Aight, "Hey, Uncle James!"

702
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,010
I look like, "Man, I don't know you,

703
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,340
"Down there struttin' around,

705
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,970
like a Frisco fruit cup."

706
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,360
I know his daddy mad as hell.

707
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,300
You still skateboarding?

708
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,480
Nah.

709
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,380
What?

710
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,620
Come here, help me cut these out.

711
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,710
And make sure the color bleeds all the way through,

712
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,290
no white edges, aight?

713
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,800
Yes, sir. Same as always.

714
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,380
Yeah.

715
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,820
Same as always.

716
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,270
you remember that, warehouse we squatted at?

717
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,100
After we lived in the El Dorado?

718
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,420
We lost that ' cause we didn't pay taxes, right?

719
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,340
Hell, nah.

720
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,990
I paid our fair share of tax on that.

721
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,620
But who cares, old drafty-ass roach nest.

722
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,100
Shit, it was that,

723
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,160
or sleeping on the street with your little ass.

724
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,830
Well, I appreciate it, Dad.

725
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,610
So, say I'm at a place now

726
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,330
and the owners left it,

727
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,630
I'm gonna pay taxes on it...

728
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,610
And you put gas and electric in your name?

729
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,230
Right, I'm gonna do that next, you know I know.

730
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,650
Okay, doin' it like your old man.

731
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,370
That's good.

732
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,010
And nobody's come to check on it?

733
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,550
Nope. It's empty.

734
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,520
Good.

735
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,040
That buys you time.

736
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,630
And they been gone three years?

737
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,290
Nah, just recently.

738
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,780
Wait, what?

739
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,950
You were workin' on it while they were still in it?

740
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,160
Yeah.

741
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,670
Where is this house?

742
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,370
It's the house in Fillmore.

743
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,010
What house?

744
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,150
Our old house.

745
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,150
What the fuck you mean, our old house?

746
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,010
Have you seen that house?

747
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,020
Well, yeah, I mean,

748
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,580
I be over there all the time.

749
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,930
Then you know that's not your old house

750
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,920
and that's not your black-ass neighborhood.

751
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,340
Little disrespectful lyin' ass.

752
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,580
- What are you talking about? - Nigga, I know you skateboard!

753
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,030
Yeah.

754
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,430
Yeah, I see all that shit out there.

755
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,770
Everybody's little path.

756
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,480
I'm like 30 steps ahead of y'all.

757
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:04,230
Go on.

758
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,830
Get!

759
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,980
You know we don't talk about that house no more.

760
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,090
Put the shit down and go!

761
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,380
You been waiting here long?

762
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,000
Hella long, bro.

763
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,550
I might just skate.

764
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,010
Well, that's nice.

765
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,130
This guy fucks.

766
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:28,730
Sundeep. Sundeep, bro, this guy fucks.

767
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,580
This guy fucks!

768
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,370
This guy fucks!

769
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:35,120
This guy fucks! This guy fucks!

770
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,950
This guy fucks! This guy fucks!

771
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,770
This guy fucks! This guy fucks!

772
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,860
this city.

773
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,130
I already know, bro.

774
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,580
Fuck!

775
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,360
Are you okay?

776
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,100
Yeah.

777
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,190
Yeah.

778
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,550
What is all this?

779
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,930
A little room I used to come in

780
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,500
when my dad was doing his thing.

781
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,620
It's cool, right?

782
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,380
Yeah, man.

783
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,170
Did you see him today?

784
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,770
How'd it go?

785
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,480
He said this was a bad idea.

786
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,420
Thought you said he was an idiot.

787
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,530
Nah, he's just mad 'cause he lost the house.

788
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,490
But what if we shouldn't be here?

789
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,580
Who should be here more?

790
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,020
Some millionaire?

791
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,920
They'd want it 'cause it looks nice.

792
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,860
You're the reason it looks nice, Jim.

793
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,260
I don't know.

794
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,060
What the fuck?

795
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,430
I invited somebody.

796
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,070
What's good, nigga?

797
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,670
Glad you could make it.

798
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,150
What's goin' on?

799
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,560
Be back in a sec, pardon me.

800
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,080
Y'all got an organ?

801
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,110
Columns and shit.

802
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,960
It's just y'all here?

803
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,780
Yeah.

804
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:13,700
It just makes noises.

805
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,200
Okay.

806
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,120
It's nice to see you in that chair,

807
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,550
I didn't know you'd pick that one.

808
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,400
Thanks a lot, bro.

809
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,150
Kinda awkward, but this place is cool.

810
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,220
Yeah.

811
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,180
Jimmie's been doing a lot to fix it up.

812
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,060
How'd y'all get this?

813
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:34,620
It's Jimmie's.

814
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,070
His grandpa built it.

815
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,790
He was the first black man in San Francisco.

816
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,880
That's what they call him anyways.

817
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,100
Shit.

818
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:47,580
This that house?

819
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,580
Jimmie used to talk about this spot all the time.

820
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,430
But you know how niggas be in the group home.

821
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,110
Overexaggerating and shit.

822
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,320
Trying to be all special.

823
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,480
You weren't lying about this one, though, h Jimmie?

824
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,010
You were in a group home?

825
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,040
Yeah.

826
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,810
For like a year.

827
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,010
Yep.

828
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,470
You guys wanna go for a schvitz?

829
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,990
A what?

830
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,550
Wait, your grandfather made this too?

831
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,690
Nah. Nah, these white people did.

832
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,450
Well, how you know he was the first one, though?

833
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,370
Nigga be lyin'.

834
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:58,290
Bro, he came over here from New Orleans.

835
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:01,000
There was hella Japanese people, bro.

836
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,360
And then they got thrown into little war camps

837
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,690
and he wasn't tryin' to move into nobody else's shit,

838
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,330
so he built this, bro.

839
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,550
This is great.

840
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,090
You still skate, bro?

841
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,210
Nah.

842
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,480
No, I don't skate no more.

843
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,920
Shit, I mean, you used to be hella raw.

844
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,230
Yeah.

845
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,330
I don't know, I'm, uh...

846
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:30,720
you remember Gunna?

847
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,380
Remember when he got caught stealing from the candy lady?

848
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,870
Yeah, he's an ugly-ass crier, really.

849
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,210
Man.

850
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,500
Hurt as fuck!

851
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,550
Remember, uh, Ms. Homer,

852
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,900
- the one that ran the group home? - Oh yeah!

853
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,670
And she cut that nigga hair, had his line crooked!

854
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,100
Hella much!

855
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,520
He goin', "Damn, that white lady couldn't cut no hair!"

856
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,510
Had that nigga's shit lookin' like Lombard Street.

858
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,860
That nigga said Lomb...

859
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,070
Man, you niggas gonna make me piss on myself.

860
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,810
Shit, y'all got a bathroom up in here, man?

861
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,030
In this big-ass house?

862
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:13,210
It's down the hall.

863
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,620
It's the room with the little claw-foot tub.

864
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,140
Aight, this cool as shit, big-ass house.

865
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,060
Mans...

866
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,290
I wish I had a grandpa like you.

867
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,310
Need me some shit like this.

868
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,610
This shit is enjoyable.

869
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,090
Right on, bro.

870
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,490
I'm proud of you niggas. You too, Mont.

871
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,160
Crazy-ass.

872
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,960
Just living the life, man.

873
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,920
Y'all niggas just really done made it, man.

874
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,500
Shit, I'm gonna go use this bathroom real quick.

875
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,520
You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie.

876
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:51,010
"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

877
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:14,750
You should, uh...

878
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,990
You should have your own room, bro.

879
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:21,800
That's okay, Jim.

880
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,440
Nah, seriously, man.

881
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,370
I been in your space forever.

882
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,560
This place is yours, too.

883
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,460
Any room?

884
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,630
How about this one?

885
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,650
Are you sure you want the dining room?

886
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,200
Yeah.

887
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:11,810
It's perfect.

888
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,200
Dream big, bro.

889
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:22,330
It's yours.

890
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,650
Yeah, we're gonna have to figure something out.

891
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:37,910
I don't have that much time.

892
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,950
It's a complicated situation.

893
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,140
No, the power's been on, i just need the bill in my name.

894
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,080
Okay, great. Well, when will I get the first invoice?

895
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,610
And you can't mail that any sooner?

896
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,830
He's talking about paying some bills.

897
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,430
'Cause I wouldn't say no if he offered to chip in a little more.

898
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,060
He already pays half, Grandpa.

899
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:19,120
Well, he's been here for a while, you know?

900
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,140
And he is not exactly family.

901
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,010
I think he knows that.

902
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,660
Let's hope so.

903
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,000
What's all this noise up in here?

904
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,180
I'm just packing some stuff.

905
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,000
It's for a project.

906
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,320
Since when?

907
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,150
I mean, we haven't even talked about the characters yet.

908
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:43,000
You know how much I like that.

909
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,600
Yeah, well... I'm still working on it.

910
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,130
Don't quite have a plot yet.

911
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,350
Well, we can brainstorm a little bit.

912
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,300
You know, that's where I think we the best at.

913
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,630
When we brainstorming.

914
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:01,960
I think I gotta brainstorm this one by myself right now.

915
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,820
But I'd love to talk about it soon.

916
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,060
You 'bout ready, bro?

917
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,140
Well, um...

918
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:23,360
Whatever it is, uh...

919
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,360
I'm proud of you.

920
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:33,940
Wow, look at him.

921
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,950
What type of shoes are those?

922
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,910
Yeah, you should start rocking like that, bra-bra.

923
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,450
What the fuck is up with your hat, Jimmie?

924
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,030
You look like a human cigarette, I can't handle it.

925
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,650
Jimmie, is that a bowling ball?

926
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,170
It's the black Alice and Wonderland.

927
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,320
Monty, bro, I heard you be whippin' out

928
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,900
that little weenie on all the girls.

929
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,780
Bro, with that hair, you look like a Simpson.

930
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,220
Nigga, shut up, bro, your one-shirt-havin' ass.

931
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,250
Jimmie, you wear the same shirt every motherfuckin' day.

932
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,620
You look like a fiend, Jimmie, come on!

933
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,660
just like your daddy!

934
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,310
I remember!

935
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,590
Your crackhead-ass daddy.

936
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,470
And your dumb-fiend-ass mom.

937
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,210
Family of fiends, dog.

938
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,350
I done sold him a rock back in the day.

939
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,840
What you got up in there?

940
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,210
Some lace curtains for that whole beautifyin'-ass house

941
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,170
that y'all been makin' up and shit?

942
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:22,890
Okay, Kofi! Okay, what else?

943
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,820
Look! These niggas the other day, they pulled up the other day.

944
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,680
Niggas had all types of feminine shit

945
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,270
goin' on in that house, bro.

946
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,040
Jimmie, what two men do that?

947
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,850
Just 'cause you in that big ass house,

948
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,470

949
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:35,510
- Never. - You're not better than us.

950
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,020
What is those, lace curtains

951
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,630
you gonna beautify the house with?

952
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,150
Come on, man, soft-ass nigga.

953
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,990
I know who you is, Jimmie, remember!

954
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:45,770
You know what y'all need to do?

955
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:46,740
Y'all need to disappear

956
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,630
like a motherfuckin' magic trick, nigga!

957
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,580
Rabbit out the hat, get the fuck out here.

958
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:51,970
Fuck outta here!

959
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,400
Jimmie! Jimmie! Go home!

960
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,500
You're really drawing them?

961
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,520
They just talk shit.

962
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,670
Well, you talked shit when I met you.

963
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,520
I did?

964
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,500
You did.

965
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:32,960
It's fine, though.

966
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,240
Why'd you hang out with me, then?

967
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,840
You care about things. I liked you.

968
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:50,840
You really don't give a fuck what anybody says?

969
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,080
I shouldn't get to appreciate them 'cause they're mean to me?

970
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:01,100
That's silly.

971
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,810
What are you doing here?

972
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,800
What are you ever doing here?

973
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,900
Didn't you move out, though?

974
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,220
Yeah.

975
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,450
They changed the fuckin' locks on me.

976
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,830
I'm sorry, that sucks.

977
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,820
What do you want, man?

978
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:31,560
How long you gonna be here?

979
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,020
I don't know yet.

980
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,730
I'm just tryin' to...

981
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,840
Let go.

982
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,720
Okay, well...

983
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,210
I guess we'll just come back tomorrow then.

984
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:47,250
Great.

985
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,210
That's nice.

986
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,650
Come on, Jim, we'll go to my house.

987
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,450
In this crazy fuckin' city, you're still here.

988
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:13,280
Man, those damn kids dropping bubble gum all over the place,

989
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:15,430
it'll get all over your seat, man.

990
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:16,410
You know what I'm sayin'?

991
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:19,740
Think she'll stay there all night?

992
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:23,950
Watch, we'll come back

993
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,640
and she'll be painting the windowsill.

994
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:39,430
Yes, baby. Yes, I will be there.

995
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,340
I've been clean for three years,

996
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,670
I know where those meetings are.

997
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,300
All right, you got it.

998
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,000
I'll be there 15 minutes early.

999
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,300
Yes. Yes, I told...

1000
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,430
Jayboe?

1001
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:54,880
Jayboe.

1002
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,460
Mom.

1003
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,190
Mom.

1004
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,050
Good to see you.

1005
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,790
- Yeah. I'm sorry. - That's all right.

1006
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,570
I thought you and Ron were in LA.

1007
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:20,840
No, we been back for three months now.

1008
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,590
This is my friend, Mont.

1009
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:28,940
'Scuse me, I'm Jimmie's mom,

1010
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:29,790
Nice to meet you.

1011
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,120

1015
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:37,330
You should stop by.

1016
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,880
You know, come check it out.

1017
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,090
That's nice. Yeah.

1018
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,140
The house, my dad's old house.

1019
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:45,910
Your family house,

1020
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,410

1021
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,280
Okay. Well, I got your number, I'll call you.

1022
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,630
Try to come over there tomorrow.

1023
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:54,950
I don't have a phone.

1024
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,450
Well, I just have to come over there, then.

1025
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,590
What's the best time to come? I'll be over there tomorrow.

01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:24,400
Well, it was good to see you too, son, okay?

1036
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,480
- All right, bye now. - Okay.

1037
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,900
Okay. Oh, my God, you taller than me now.

1038
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,530
- Yeah... - Okay, bye, son.

1039
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,570
Yeah, bye.

1040
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,500
Why? Why?

1041
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,300
- What happened? - Why?

1042
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:25,920
What the fuck?

1044
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,220
What happened?

1045
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:43,560
- What the fuck happened? - He got shot.

1046
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:46,110
They shot him.

1047
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,940
Who? Who shot him?

1048
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,660
Who?

1049
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:57,660
Bay niggas.

1050
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,080
For what?

1051
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,000
For what?

1052
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,670
He was talking shit to the wrong niggas.

1053
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:11,840
Tried to bluff some niggas out.

1054
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,590
Tried to bluff them out?

1055
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:17,220
Man, what's with all the questions, bro?

1056
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:20,810
I just don't get it.

1057
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,140
I just fuckin' seen y'all.

1058
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,270
And nigga?

1059
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,230
And I don't fucking get it!

1060
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:27,400
Man.

1061
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,150
Get the fuck up outta here, bro.

1062
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,730
Me get the fuck outta here?

1063
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:32,820
- Yes, nigga, go! - It's your fucking fault!

1064
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,570
That's my fuckin' friend, too!

1065
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,650
- All right, nigga. - Get on this nigga!

1066
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,490
All right.

1067
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:42,330
Push up on this nigga, bro.

1068
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:43,910
You finna let him say that?

1069
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,370
That poor boy and his friends.

1070
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,870
I'm sorry, Jimmie.

1071
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:33,000
I hope I never made you feel like you weren't welcome here.

1072
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:38,220
No, I... I never felt like that.

1073
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,930
'Cause I don't care where you been.

1074
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,980
You don't have to tell me.

1075
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:50,850
It's just, you two

1076
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:54,070
stick together.

1079
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:11,460
You know, I was writing a play about him.

1080
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,180
You don't have to stop now.

1081
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:27,520
"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

1082
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:40,200
I know it sounds weird, but...

1083
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,570
I kinda feel like that could've been me.

1084
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:46,990
If not for the house.

1085
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,720
Man, I wanna go home.

1086
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:26,450
Filthy, fishy salt water.

1087
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:32,290
Water been funkier than the Devil's mouth for 50 years.

1088
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,790
Now they wanna clean it up.

1089
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:37,960
They've got plans for us.

1090
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,260
We were made to be put through Hell.

1091
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:46,760
Purified... We were made to be put through Hell.

1092
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,020
Be purified.

1093
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:03,360
Fuck!

1094
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:06,240
Oh, God.

1095
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,240
Fuck!

1096
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,880
How did she toss all of our shit?

1097
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,100
I don't think it was her.

1099
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,450
Fuckin' traitor.

1100
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,210
Okay.

1101
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:10,970
Can you stay here and watch the shit?

1102
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,390
Yeah, where you going?

1103
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,980
- Where you going? - I'll be back.

1104
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:18,400
I'll be back.

1105
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,440
Jimmie!

1106
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,620
Sorry, how can I help you today?

1107
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,790
- I want to buy a house. - A house?

1108
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:40,920
That's exciting.

1109
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,880
Are you working with an agent?

1110
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,920
No. Do I need to?

1111
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:49,470
No. Not necessarily.

1112
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,470
Do you have a price range in mind?

1113
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:52,970
I have a house in mind.

1114
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:59,190
It's on the market, I assume?

1115
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,190
How much are they asking?

1116
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,730
At least $4 million.

1117
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:08,240
And how much are you willing to put down?

1118
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:11,110
How much is usual?

1119
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:16,160
Well, typically, we'd be looking to secure at least 20%.

1120
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:25,550
I wouldn't have that.

1121
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,630
That's understandable.

1122
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,800
It's going to be hard to land a place like that.

1123
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,470
But suppose I ask instead...

1124
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,470
No, no, look.

1125
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:39,680
I get it.

1126
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,520
I'm young. I'm black.

1127
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,360
I'm not rich.

1128
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:49,320
I came here knowing all that.

1129
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,200
But let's be real, you also got a quota to meet.

1130
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,570
Now I'm not calling you a predator... Sir.

1131
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,620
But you're trying to make your money.

1132
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,410
So let me help you do that. Sir.

1133
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,120
{\an8}That's not the way this works.

1134
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,120
You can give me whatever deal you gotta give me.

1135
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,620
I don't care what it is.

1136
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,790
'Cause unlike all the other people that default,

1137
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,210
this is the only house I'll ever want.

1138
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,720
So I'll never miss a monthly bill, ever.

1139
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,050
{\an8}I completely understand how you feel, sir.

1140
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,050
You can give me your highest interest rate.

1141
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,510
You can give me your highest interest rate, okay?

1142
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,720
- Fuck... Fuck me. - No, I completely...

1143
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:17,850
You don't even have to feel bad.

1144
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:19,350
You don't even have to feel bad.

1145
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,900
Okay? I will pay back every single cent.

1146
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,230
I'm sorry, sir.

1147
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,400
I will pay back every single cent.

1148
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,570
Okay, okay, you win!

1149
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:38,200
Okay, yep, it's yours.

1150
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,080
You charming bastard, okay.

1151
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,370
Talk to you soon, buh-bye.

1152
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,920
How's it going, man?

1153
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,540
Fine, sir.

1154
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,630
I noticed the house we discussed is now for sale.

1155
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,630
There are some alarming elements in your literature

1156
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,390
I thought you would like to know.

1157
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,020
And certainly the Bureau of Real Estate would.

1158
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:06,520
This claims the property has a view of the Golden Gate.

1159
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,270
Which... I don't think is true.

1160
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,780
Well, it isn't. It isn't true.

1161
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,860
It also claims to have all the original

1162
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,700
"fixtures, floors, and faucets."

1163
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,620
Isn't true.

1164
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,830
And are you planning on disclosing that there's no septic tank?

1165
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,540
Which means, any day now,

1166
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,210
the garden could be flooded with shit.

1167
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,760
Where's this going, man?

1168
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,390
All this together seems like false advertisement.

1169
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,390
Which is grounds for void a sale.

1170
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:41,510
Potential revoke of license.

1171
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,180
I thought it might've been you guys.

1172
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,610
What's your deal, man?

1173
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:51,940
Don't have a deal.

1174
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:55,900
Look...

1175
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,450
Somebody on this floor would've gotten that house

1176
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,780
if it wasn't me.

1177
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,330
At least I'm from here, right?

1178
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:08,210
- I put your stuff on the street as a favor. - Okay.

1179
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,620
I could've had it trucked away,

1180
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:10,830
but I left it out for you.

1181
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,630
Look, dick wad.

1182
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:14,920
I'm not fucking around, I will report you.

1183
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:15,840
For what?

1184
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,340
Listing a view of the bridge? And fixtures?

1185
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,600
Everybody does that.

1186
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,720
I literally copy-pasted that shit.

1187
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,980
Well, you're lying about the history of the house.

1188
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:27,730
- I'm not lying about that. - Yes, you are!

1189
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:30,520
You say it was built one hundred years earlier than it actually was.

1190
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,900
Look, I'm not making this up.

1191
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,150
Yes, you are!

1192
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,980
James Fails built this house in 1946.

1193
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,780
- James? - Fails!

1194
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,400
What are you talking about?

1195
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,490
Look, man.

1196
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,120
Deed of Trust, 1857.

1197
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,250
Architect Gil-hoo-ley, some shit.

1198
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,050
Your guy Fails lost it in the '90s.

1199
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,340
See, right there.

1200
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,050
Look, man.

1201
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,930
If you need a week to find somewhere else,

1202
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,050
then take it.

1203
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,260
But...

1204
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,270
Don't go pulling some squatters rights shit on me, man.

1205
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:09,850
I got your mail.

1206
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,190
I know your name.

1207
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,570
I don't want to call the cops.

1208
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,320
I don't want to do that to you.

1209
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,460
Where'd you go?

1210
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,540
Doesn't matter, bro.

1211
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,960
I got everything inside.

1212
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,670
Except the couch.

1213
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,050
That shit almost fell on me.

1214
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,480
Jim...

1215
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:34,100
I spoke to the realtor.

1216
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,810
Yeah, fuck that guy.

1217
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,740
He's gonna throw us out.

1218
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,620
And eventually call the cops.

1219
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,620
I don't know how much longer we can keep doing this.

1220
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:56,000
I understand if you can't.

1221
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,840
I do.

1222
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,760
But I'm not leaving.

1223
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,180
- Jim, he said your grand... - Where am I gonna go?

1224
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,560
My dad's in the SRO.

1225
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,610
My aunt's out in bum fuck.

1226
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:20,820
My mom...

1227
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:25,110
Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

1228
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,580
I'm not leaving, bro.

1229
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:35,250
I'm the last one left.

1230
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,090
We have my house.

1231
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,600
I can't go back there, bro.

1232
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:55,850
Mont,

1233
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,560
this house...

1234
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,570
This is what I do.

1235
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,820
It's what we do, Mont.

1236
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,660
This is our shit.

1237
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,950
We can't give up now.

1238
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:11,910
We gotta fight.

1239
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,830
Right?

1240
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,540
Yeah.

1241
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,340
I'm with you, bro.

1242
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,760
You always been with me.

1243
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:56,790
Shit, you're writing?

1244
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,290
Yeah.

1245
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,790
I think I cracked a play.

1246
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,420
I'd like to put it on next week, if that's all right?

1247
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:12,050
Hell, yeah, get it, bro!

Hella fuckin' early.

1274
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,180
Here we go.

1275
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,490
Why are you dressed like a white boy?

1276
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,620
It's for your little show, huh?

1277
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,640
Man.

1278
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:58,030
You mess up my daddy's chair, Montgomery?

1279
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,080
No.

1280
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:05,030
No, sir, we... we were just...

1281
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,400
What you stuttering for? You got stage fright already?

1282
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:10,250
No.

1283
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:15,380
I don't care about the chair, son.

1284
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:19,880
But be easy with it.

1285
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:22,050
Thank you.

1286
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,180
Carry on.

1287
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:07,270
My daddy hated when I played that shit.

1288
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:20,110
Yeah, come on in, don't be shy.

1289
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,820
His grandpa built it.

1290
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,990
Not bad for a black man, huh?

1291
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:27,290
Oh, no.

1292
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:30,540
Very good. Very good.

1293
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,800
So, this is gonna be interesting. This is nice.

1294
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,550
- Nice crowd, too. - Yeah.

1295
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:45,680
You make a lot of money on candy?

1296
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:47,220
Sell candy?

1297
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,600
- I used to, for years. - Oh, yeah?

1298
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,550
Most of these new white people that's moving

1299
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,980
in these black neighborhoods,

1300
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,060
they don't even know they standing in the kitchen

1301
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,860
where a dude got shot at.

1302
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:59,360
I didn't know he was doing a play and shit.

1303
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,270
He just invited us.

1304
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,360
I don't know what weird shit they got goin' on,

1305
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,570
but it's pretty weird.

1306
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,710
What I'mma hit you for?

1307
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:19,920
You my folks.

1308
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:26,000
All right. All right.

1309
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,970
But I can't have soft niggas hanging around me.

1310
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:35,690
Hit me.

1311
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,360
Nah!

1312
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,820
Nah! For what, nigga?

1313
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,070
Hit me.

1314
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:47,070
Man up, nigga. Man up!

1315
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:49,780
No, bro!

1316
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,040
No! No, bro, no!

1317
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,410
You soft.

1318
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,830
You soft, nigga.

1319
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,230
They gonna call you a bitch at your funeral.

1320
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:03,600
I ain't no bitch!

1321
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,820
I ain't no bitch! I'm a man!

1322
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:06,930
Then hit me.

1323
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:10,710
Hit me, bro. Hit me.

1324
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:13,740
Hit me, nigga.

1325
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:25,790
All right!

1326
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,880
All right! Yeah!

1327
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:29,140
Here, nigga.

1328
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:30,790
I don't give a fuck.

1329
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:32,880
Come see me, nigga.

1330
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,340
Who out there hiding?

1331
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,690
Man up!

1332
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:36,950
Man up, nigga!

1333
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,000
Man up!

1334
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,620
No words.

1335
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,110
No words!

1336
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:51,710

Are these the people who knew Kofi?

1348
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:27,940
Got yelled at by my bitch boss for being late!

1349
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:29,090
Sorry!

1350
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,460

Man! Can't believe we lost my bro!

1354
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:45,840
But you wouldn't want me to be sad, Ko,

1355
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,810

ten years ago!

1360
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,150
Are these the people who knew Kofi?

1361
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:08,870
Kofi had dimensions.

1362
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:13,840
More than a... a post could reflect or a play could capture.

1363
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,530
So I summon you.

1364
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,350
Celebrate the life he lived.

1365
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:23,670
Not through those who speak the loudest.

1366
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:26,180
But through the memories he left us all.

1367
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,880
Ma'am!

1368
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:31,210
- Me? - How will you...

1369
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,480
How will you remember Kofi?

1370
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:47,270
He, you know, he used to come and walk my niece

1371
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:50,340
home from school when she first moved up here.

1372
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:53,200
He was a little gentleman, or whatnot,

1373
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,680
you know, sweet, um...

1374
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:58,540
It's just sad.

1375
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:04,720
I coached Kofi in Pop Warner.

1376
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,530
He stayed behind and helped me pack up.

1377
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,150
Every day.

1378
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:11,370
Yeah.

1379
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:15,270
And how 'bout you, young man?

1380
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:22,740
Shit, man.

1381
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:25,280
I don't know.

1382
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,410
Did I push him too hard?

1383
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:33,040
Kofi was my nigga, man.

1384
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,410
Did I push him too hard?

1385
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,960
How 'bout you?

1386
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,460
Well...

1387
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,800
My last memory of Kofi

1388
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,370
was him talking shit to me.

1389
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,950
He said some of the most fucked-up shit

1390
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:10,900
anybody's ever said to me.

1391
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,600
But Kofi also got jumped

1392
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,410
for defending me against the older kids in the group home.

1393
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,750
He didn't like to fight,

1394
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:25,330
but he fought for me then.

1395
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,250
People aren't one thing.

1396
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:40,900
That.

1397
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,380
All... all of it.

1398
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,410
What would have happened

1399
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,150
if Kofi could've

1400
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,770
showed himself?

1401
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:02,670
All forms of himself.

1402
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:06,580
The world

1403
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,520
put him in a box!

1404
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:13,620
And he never

1405
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:15,840
pushed beyond it.

1406
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:21,220
Let us.

1407
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:25,080
Let us break the boxes!

1408
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,590
Let us give each other the courage!

1409
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:30,190
To... to see!

1410
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,690
Beyond the stories we are born into!

1411
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:36,430
Let us all

1412
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:39,190
really look

1413
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,360
at Jimmie Fails IV.

1414
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:52,830
Self-taught historian.

1415
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:55,260
Carpenter.

1416
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:58,770
Gentle, loving man.

1417
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:01,040
A true survivor. Jimmie!

1418
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,130
How many places have you lived?

1419
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:05,100
And if they kicked you out tomorrow,

1420
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:08,070
you would still be all those things!

1421
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,970
You exist beyond the...

1422
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:13,270
these walls, you extend beyond your...

1423
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:15,190
your... your forefathers!

1424
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,160
You are more than this house!

1425
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,660
Jimmie, you are not these... these walls!

1426
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,700
You're not these floors, you're not this ceiling!

1427
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,280
- It's time you know! - Bro, what are you doing?

1428
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,690
- What are you doing? - It is time!

1429
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,660
- It is time you know! - I don't need to know,

1430
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:29,510
I don't need to know. Let's stop. Let's stop.

1431
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,750
- Jimmie... You don't! - Enough, stop!

1432
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:36,210
- Please, stop. Mont! - Jimmie!

1433
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,770
- Your grandpa didn't build this house! - Enough!

1434
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:44,950
He didn't build it, Jimmie!

1435
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:55,940
Yes, he did.

1436
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:01,050
- He built this house! - He didn't, I saw it, man,

1437
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:02,430
I saw the deed.

1438
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,570
I saw it.

1439
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,930
I don't know what the hell that thing was.

1440
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:57,990
Then he shoots a left.

1441
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:02,950
Man, let 'em leave.

1442
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:05,390
They don't deserve to be in here anyway.

1443
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:11,790
Neither do we.

1444
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,360
You gonna really listen to what

1445
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,610
another-ass nigga tell you what's true?

1446
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:24,340
Come on, Jayboe, get your spine up, son.

1447
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:27,200
- Have some pride, man. - I've been doin'.

1448
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:36,980
But you say it.

1449
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:39,880
Say what?

1450
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,670
The truth.

1451
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,640
What?

1452
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,420
That grandpa didn't build this house.

1453
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:52,940
Man, get outta here with that bullshit.

1454
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:54,520
Come on, Jayboe.

1455
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,110
Just say it.

1456
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,130
Can't tell you shit.

1457
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,600
I'm outta here, man.

1458
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:25,530
You sit in that bullshit if you want.

1459
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:57,270
Jayboe.

1460
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,340
I been telling people he built it for so long.

1461
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:15,670
Almost forgot it wasn't true.

1462
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:23,180
This was ours.

1463
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,010
And then it wasn't.

1464
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,540
So you just tell yourself what you need

1465
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,830
to make you feel like it still is.

1466
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,030
Shit.

1467
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,650
I did it, too.

1468
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:45,670
It makes you feel

1469
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:48,430
special.

1470
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,410
But you got a chance to get out

1471
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:55,770
from underneath all of that now.

1472
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:59,370
I don't want to.

1473
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:03,090
I just want it.

1474
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,560
Is that what you really want?

1475
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:15,590
To spend the rest of your life working for this?

1476
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,330
Fighting for this?

1477
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:26,100
I believe that you could make this place yours.

1478
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,390
I really do.

1479
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:36,520
But if you leave

1480
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,530
it's not your loss.

1481
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:46,390
It's San Francisco's.

1482
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,150
Fuck San Francisco.

1483
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:39,040
- This city blows. - Big time.

1484
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:40,950
I mean, whatever, I'm not above

1485
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:43,540
living in a former crack house, you know?

1486
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:46,100
But, I came here for Janis and the Airplane,

1487
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:48,500
not to work at a fucking startup.

1488
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,350
Dude, I've been saying for months,

1489
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,050
let's just move to East LA.

1490
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:53,510
This city's dead.

1491
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:55,230
Nah.

1492
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,240
Seriously, fuck this city.

1493
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,100
'Scuse me?

1494
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:05,460
You don't get to hate San Francisco.

1495
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:10,140
I'm sorry, what?

1496
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,700
Yeah, dude, I mean...

1497
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,910
Sorry, but I'll hate what I want.

1498
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,520
Do you love it?

1499
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:23,470
It's... I mean yeah, I'm here.

1500
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,720
But do I have to love it?

1501
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:29,220
You don't get to hate it unless you love it.

1502
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:34,500
Classic Muni shit.

1503
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:46,070
Who call the money man, come on now, hurry up.

1504
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,730
Pay attention!

1505
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,490
Alexander the Great was a black man.

1506
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:55,010
They don't teach you that in the devil school system.

1507
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:59,730
I can't take another day of this bullshit.

1508
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:08,560
Jim.

1509
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:16,700
I'm sorry I did that.

1510
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,700
It was a stupid play.

1511
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:25,160
Nah.

1512
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,060
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

1513
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:34,810
I just wanted it to be true.

1514
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:38,540
It felt so good, you know?

1515
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,670
It's okay.

1516
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:06,750
Jimmie.

1517
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,280
Are you hungry?

1518
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:10,920
Fucking starving.

1519
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:17,120
He's giving up.

1520
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:20,230
I can't take no more.

1521
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,670
He's breaking down.

1522
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,930
He's really tearing this apartment apart.

1523
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,820
This looks exciting though, you know?

1524
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,680
- Yeah. Yeah, it is. - Yeah? Oh, yeah?

1525
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:37,490
I got it now.

1526
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:39,620
He seems like he's horny or something.

1527
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:47,370
He's banging on the door again.

1529
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:23,530
Hi, Will.

1530
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:24,970
I'm leaving for San Francisco today,

1531
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:26,050
but I'll be back in about a week,

1532
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:27,740
I'll take care of it for you then.

1533
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:28,850
Sure is a scorcher, isn't it

1534
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:30,130
Well, I've seen him worse.

1535
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:31,470
Well have a nice time, Bert.

1536
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:33,940
- Yeah, thanks. - Why don't you...
