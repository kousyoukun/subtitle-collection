1
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,398
Jasmine?

2
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,986
Jasmine! We gonna be late. Come on.

3
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:17,994
Let's go.

4
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,908
Why do they have on these suits
and we don't?

5
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,915
Something's going on right in our face.

6
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:29,292
Y'all so stuck in those iPhones,
J-Phone 12s or whatever.

7
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,251
Blow up in your hand.

8
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,585
You can't Google
what's going on right now!

9
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,137
Are y'all paying attention?

10
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,510
Why do they have on these suits
if we don't?

11
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,102
Why?

12
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,439
They here to clean this water?

13
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,108
When this water been dirtier
than the devil's mouth for 50 years.

14
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,438
And now they want to clean it?

15
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,408
They got plans for us, man.

16
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,653
Looking like George Jetson rejects.

17
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,863
'Cause they weak!

18
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,495
Weak hearts! Weak lungs!

19
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,827
Can't even breathe up here without a mask.

20
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,460
But we was put through hell
to be purified.

21
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,389
You know what I'm sayin',
brothers and sisters?

22
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,762
Man,
it's crazy what jail will do to a nigga.

23
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,141
They don't care about they water, man.
There's something going on.

24
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,971
We gonna get to the bottom of it.

25
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,975
And they lucky I'm a man of God right now!

26
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,810
You think he rehearses this every morning?

27
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,816
Or they would catch these hands.

28
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,402
Seems a bit more impromptu.

29
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,699
2019 out here!

30
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,779
We been yellin' about this water
since before they were born.

31
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,830
Before they were born!

32
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,082
Where's this bus, man?
We're not gonna make it.

33
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,712
Y'all leave us the hell alone.
Unless y'all really here to help us.

34
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,134
We'll get there.

35
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,052
They got plans for us, man.

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,721
- We're not gonna make it, bro.
- Not for you and me.

37
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,972
So I urge you! Fight for your land!

38
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,557
Fight for your home!

39
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,061
- Fight for your...
- Let's skate.

40
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,870
This here?
This is the edge, bro!

41
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,040
The final frontier of Manifest Destiny.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,291
Last edge of the city.

43
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,797
Man, two steps further,
you'll be drinking that filthy saltwater.

44
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,474
But we built these ships,
dredged these canals,

45
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,391
in the San Francisco
they never knew existed.

46
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,149
And now they come to build something new?

47
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,831
Whole blocks half in the past,
half in the future.

48
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,620
But should you venture
into their San Francisco,

49
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,956
the one they pillaged for gold!

50
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,004
Remember your truth!

51
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,753
In the city of facades.

52
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:20,067
Take me with you! Hey! Hey!
Take me with you, man!

53
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,820
Come on, where are we going?
Where are we going?

54
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,029
Come on, I'm coming! I'm coming!

55
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:39,041
Look at them look at you.
Look down at you.

56
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,752
<i>But we built them!</i>

57
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,633
<i>We are these homes!</i>

58
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,760
<i>Their eyes...</i>

59
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,263
<i>their pointed brims.</i>

60
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,018
<i>We move if they move.</i>

61
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,140
<i>Our sweat soaked in the wood.</i>

62
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,148
<i>Gilded in our image.</i>

63
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,316
<i>This is our home!</i>

64
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,323
<i>Our home!</i>

65
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,949
<i>Our home.</i>

66
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,542
Thanks.

67
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,590
Are you sure they're gone?

68
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,858
Jim?

69
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,986
I mean, their car is gone.

70
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,906
Let's check the back, man.

71
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,276
Good morning. How are you?

72
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,344
Remember that time
they were in the kitchen?

73
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,080
Jim!

74
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,287
Remember the kitchen?

75
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,751
Yeah, sure.

76
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,587
But, bruh.

77
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,046
Didn't I tell you these railings
are periwinkle, not black.

78
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,101
Mm-hmm.

79
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,435
Yeah, I got it.

80
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,106
We gotta start coming more
than every two weeks, bro.

81
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,772
This fuckin' garden's a nightmare.

82
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,568
- I'll bring my grandpa's tools next time.
- Please do.

83
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,710
Wallpaper's chipping.

84
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,676
These people are killing this house.

85
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,431
You're not goin' in, though, Jim.

86
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
I mean...

87
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,807
I mean...

88
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,356
no.

89
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,601
They're definitely gone, though.

90
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,311
Better be quick this time. Hmm?

91
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,942
Yeah, I know.

92
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,649
Takes time.

93
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,742
Yeah, I know.

94
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,328
- I'll be at my spot.
- All right.

95
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,375
Quick.

96
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,083
Okay.

97
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,443
- Jesus, man!
- Honey.

98
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,199
Just get the heck out of here, man.

99
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,933
- What the fuck?
- He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

100
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,368
He's painting the house now?

101
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,918
- Well, yeah.
- Stop fixing my house!

102
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,666
I'm almost done. Just hold on.

103
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,419
Why don't you just paint
the neighbors' houses?

104
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,546
- Theirs are worse than ours.
- Just hold on one second.

105
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,845
I mean, we appreciate it,
in some way, but, yeah.

106
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,931
It's weird, man.

107
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,348
I'm almost done.

108
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,386
Look, we will call the cops, man.
And I mean it this time.

109
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,767
No, we're not gonna call the cops.

110
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,190
We're not calling the cops.
Just stop coming back.

111
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,939
I'm almost done. Hold on. Please, hold on.

112
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,487
Ugh! Just get off my fucking birdie bath.

113
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,657
Ugh! Get outta here, man.

114
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,700
- Those were $3.
- Fine.

115
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,073
I'll finish it next time. God!

116
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,953
Next time? Oh, just get...
Get the heck off my birdie bath!

117
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,909
Just water the plants in the back
or I will.

118
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,670
Oh!

119
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,706
Bro!
You were supposed to be the lookout.

120
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,881
Mm-hmm.

121
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,653
You were the one
that was so worried.

122
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,884
I got distracted.

123
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,555
Bro!

124
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,886
What if OG is right, though?

125
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,843
You really gotta stop eating
the fish out there.

126
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,581
I think it's fine.

127
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,971
All fish has mercury.

128
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,935
I know,
but I saw a seagull with a dick, bro.

129
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,478
Well, so I guess it's a male.

130
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,275
No, bro, like a human dick.

131
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,617
Oh, nasty-ass tumble-weave. Pussy.

132
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,572
- Wild, bro.
- Wassup, nigga?

133
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,353
Ain't tryin' do nothin'.
I ain't tryin' do that bullshit...

134
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,730
- Stop playin' before I slap your face.
- Man, shut your ass up, nigga.

135
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,962
I ain't finna chase you.

136
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,334
You play too much, bro.

137
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,757
You lucky I don't beat your ass out here,
bro.

138
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,552
- Kofi! What's good, brother?
- What's up with y'all?

139
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,800
Hey,
you know I seen Moms last night, right?

140
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,803
She was looking like she was
missing a little bit on the top.

141
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,385
I mean, we shower in the same water, Jim.

142
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,645
So, niggas takin' showers together now?

143
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,147
Probably was.

144
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,525
That's fruity.

145
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,037
I was trying to tell him
not to eat the fish

146
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,705
because the water is toxic.

147
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:11,377
Well, duh. That's 'cause they built
the atomic bomb right there, nigga.

148
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,591
I don't think that's true.

149
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,885
What'd he say?

150
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,379
- Damn.
- Breath stink. That's true.

151
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,646
Bro, them shoes ain't true.

152
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,974
I know your Jesus-lookin' ass
ain't talkin', bro.

153
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,521
- Them things is phony.
- They're definitely phony.

154
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,231
- What about cuz, man?
- Oh, yeah, dude is a cat.

155
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,986
You see his hair, he might be a cheetah.

156
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,117
<i>Can I help you?</i>

157
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,888
<i>I'd like to see the man in charge.</i>

158
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,376
<i>In here.</i>

159
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,418
He's walking him into the Chief's office.

160
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,211
Oh, dear.

161
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,045
<i>I want to report a murder.</i>

162
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,259
Now, who's that?

163
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,137
Edgar O'Ryan.

164
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,504
<i>Where was this murder committed?</i>

165
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,470
- Edmund O'Brien.
<i>- San Francisco.</i>

166
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,847
- That's right.
- Oh. Oh, him, yeah, yeah.

167
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,179
<i>Who was murdered?</i>

168
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,731
<i>I was.</i>

169
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,570
What?

170
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,524
- How?
- Just watch it.

171
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,912
Hey, hand me my beer, Son.

172
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,580
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

173
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,662
Yeah, okay.

174
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,453
O'Brien is smoking a cigarette

175
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,254
- in his office.
- Okay, yeah.

176
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,335
- Secretary's perched.
- She pretty?

177
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,513
Mmm.

178
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,972
- Yeah?
- I'd say she is.

179
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,518
You dog.

180
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,435
Hey, Mont!

181
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,438
- Montgomery!
- Hmm?

182
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,192
How do I get their old
croissant-throwing asses out of the house?

183
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,655
What if I peed on their table?

184
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,114
Like,
what if I climbed up the birdie bath,

185
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,039
broke in and just peed all over
that stupid little yellow table?

186
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,081
Wouldn't that ruin the floors?

187
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,255
Yeah, I guess you got a point there.

188
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,428
Oh.

189
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:43,404
You think they'd let me live there as,
like, a caretaker for the house?

190
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,526
No.

191
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,116
That's fucked up.

192
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,538
I mean, I take pretty good
care of the house.

193
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,209
I think so at least.

194
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,503
Yeah, you do.

195
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,915
We like having you here, Jim.

196
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,757
I know, bro.

197
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,679
But...

198
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,885
you know there's no place like home.

199
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,811
Yeah.

200
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,847

All right?

214

Small guy.

215
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,870
He's perfect.

216
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,547
Hey,
you get any writing done this morning?

217
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,966
Um...

218
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,765
writing is rewriting.

219
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,311
It's all part of the process.

220
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,224
Yeah, you got it, though.

221
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,773
Hmm. Yeah, man.

222
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,425
What the f...

223
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,598
Y'all been here 12 years,
still can't take care of this house.

224
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,283
Hey, Paul.

225
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,029
Hey!

226
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,953
I got you.

227
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,749
- Hi.
- Eat your banana.

228
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,545
- Fuck you.
- Hey.

229
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,247
You're a nice man.

230
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,459
You're a nice woman.

231
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,468
But I don't know you.

232
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,766
Well, yeah.

233
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,185
You know me pretty well, actually.

234
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,766
But you aren't my husband.

235
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,768
You're a little too young for me.

236
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,361
I am young.

237
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,402
I'm always young.

238
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,077
You're a nice man.

239
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,954
Oh, thank you.

240
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,170
You're a nice woman.

241
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,961
You old marshmallow, cream puff-ass,

242
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,418
candied yam-ass nigga,
cream puff-ass nigga.

243
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,219
- Shut up, bitch, bro.
- Hold this shit.

244
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,968
You bitch.

245
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:24,301
I should snatch your one-ass dread,
lookin' like a fuckin' Rastafarian sperm.

246
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,148
You got me fucked up.

247
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,753
- We got you fucked up?
- We did!

248
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,963
That's all you gotta say?

249
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,631
What I'm supposed to do, take off?

250
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,966
I don't care about none of that shit.

251
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,902
I just ain't got nothin' else to say.

252
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,053
Man, I put that on a fact,
that this nigga's a bitch, man.

253
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,517
- Is that sure, man.
- Fuck you, n...

254
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,614
Wassup, nigga?

255
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,457
'Sup, nigga?

256
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,294
'Sup, nigga?

257
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,341
How are you, nigga?

258
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,675
I hope she's not home.

259
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,806
That garden...

260
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,349
We have so much to do.

261
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,766
We have to rake it. We have to weed it.

262
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,215
- We have to...
- Jim.

263
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,437
Isn't that the car you used to live in?

264
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,688
Oh, God.

265
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:57,815
Jimmie!

266
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,197
What up, filth-smellin' motherfucker?

267
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,493
Do you need a ride?

268
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,121
Jimmie! What's happenin', baby?

269
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,457
Get your young,
old-looking ass in the car.

270
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,460
Daddy face. Jimmie!

271
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,716
Oh, my God, where is this bus?

272
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:28,676
If you don't get your up the-father-from-
<i>Good-Times</i> shirt-wearing ass in this car...

273
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,562
You really gonna ride the bus
with a shovel?

274
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,765
Get your farming ass in this car.

275
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,234
Jimmie the farmer with your bitch ass.

276
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,656
Come on. Laugh a little bit, Jimmie, shit.

277
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,830
Still the same.

278
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,911
Yep,
I like what you and your dad did with it.

279
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,243
So much you drove off with it?

280
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,792
No, I borrowed it.
I didn't just... Come on.

281
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,374
I drove off with it? I borrowed it. Shit.

282
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,335
Matter of fact,
I seen your dad the other day.

283
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,178
He was good and lonely.

284
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,926
By hisself.

285
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,678
Okay.

286
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,977
I told him,
"You need to get you a cat or a dog,

287
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,805
or a woman or something, nigga, damn."

288
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,682
He's home alone.

289
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,985
Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

290
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,734
He's alone with no home.

291
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,784
Well, you live in a car by yourself.

292
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,078
Yeah, but I... But I'm not alone.

293
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,989
People like me.

294
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,078
I'm liked.

295
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,914
Lonely ass nigga.

296
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,502
When the last time
you hung out with your daddy?

297
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,889
Couple weeks ago. I don't know.

298
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,517
Couple weeks ago?
The nigga needs you today.

299
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,598
Shit.

300
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,852
That's what...
That's what people have kids for,

301
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,856
so they can have some companionship,
somebody to hang out with.

302
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,773
That's why I ain't had no kids.
'Cause I don't wanna be bothered.

303
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,574
Your daddy don't want
this fuckin' car, man.

304
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,072
- Hey.
- Hmm?

305
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,993
- Wasn't that the Savoy House?
- Oh, sure was.

306
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,834
It was 100 motherfuckers in there,
rent-controlled.

307
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,587
They thought they owned that shit.

308
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,089
The landlord burned
all of the people out of there.

309
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,388
'Cause, see, Jimmie,
you never really own shit.

310
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,258
This car ain't mine.

311
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,181
But it never was yours.

312
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,776
You never own shit!

313
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,863
What the fuck?

314
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,552
Hey, what's goin' on, man?

315
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,754
<i>No sé,</i> bro.

316
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,893
Uh, sir?

317
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,816
What's-What's going on?

318
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,235
Oh, God.

319
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,903
She's moving.

320
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,982
Fighting like crazy with her sister.

321
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,074
When someone dies in the family,
that's what white people do.

322
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,661
"This is for her,
this is for him, this is mine."

323
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,912
Who's gonna have the house?

324
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,460
So they lost the house?

325
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,039
Who's gonna possess the house?

326
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,093
They're just fighting
and fighting and fighting.

327
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,019
What's gonna happen to it now?

328
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,575
Why'd they have to move out
'cause her mom died?

329
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,830
I don't know.

330
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:23,209
They were... tasteless,
but at least they didn't fuck it up.

331
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,371
Well, that will be 10 bucks, hun.

332
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,546
Since when?

333
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,797
Since that's the best deal
you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

334
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,594
I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie. I said 16.

335
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,547
How I'm gonna eat 60 Twix?

336
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,182
I don't know your life.

337
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,468
You act like you at Costco
or something like that.

338
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,728
You ain't at Costco.

339
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,147
Hey, you can go to Costco
if you need to.

340
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,794
- You Rosco.
- Go right now.

341
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,605
Sixteen. First time you had a check.

342
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,187
Jim. Jim.

343
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,448
Jim.

344
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,070
Jim?

345
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,535
So, gentlemen.

346
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,243
What can I do for you?

347
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,628
Yeah, we're curious about a house
on Golden Gate near Fillmore.

348
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,215
- Mm-hmm.
- It's 959.

349
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,259
It's gray, it's got the gold trim.

350
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,382
- Uh, it's got...
- Yep, yep.

351
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,634
Yep, with the, um...

352
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,058
the witch hat.

353
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,719
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah!

354
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,125
I know exactly what you're talking about.

355
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,061
- That place is very special.
- Hmm.

356
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,985
I used to drive past that house
on my way to school every day.

357
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,063
- What school did you go to?
- I went to St. Ignatius.

358
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,815
You from here, too?

359
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,069
Yeah, third generation,

360
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,026
- I went to Reardon, actually.
- Really?

361
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,015
Yeah, we used to play y'all
in football all the time.

362
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,076
- You used to kill us in football.
- Yeah, yeah.

363
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,643
I didn't wanna say that, but...

364
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,203
That's awesome, right on.

365
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,787
But, so, it's for sale?
I didn't hear about that.

366
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,668
Well, I'm not sure.

367
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,466
It seems like the owner and her sister
are fighting over it.

368
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,044
But I guess her mom died.

369
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,592
Ah, man.

370
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,808
I don't know.
That sounds like an estate thing.

371
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,101
That's a sucky situation.

372
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,683
But, I mean...

373
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,525
With a house like that, they could be
fighting over that for years.

374
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,856
While it just sits there.

375
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,031
It's a pity.

376
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,779
So it's really just... just empty?

377
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:23,117
It's fucked up, right?
So fucked up. Like, it bothers me.

378
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,726
There's all these people in the street,

379
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,539
and these big old houses
are just sitting there collecting dust.

380
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,712
But shit, what else can you say?

381
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,958
The fucking injustice of it.

382
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,048
Yeah.

383
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,789
Mont! We here, baby!

384
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,418
Spoiling all the fun,

385
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:24,530
leveling most of this neighborhood
in the name of Urban Renewal.

386
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,738
Sorry about your homes
and your funky shops.

387
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:32,326
You can set up a shoeshine stand
in front of the parking lot at Safeway.

388
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,706
But you distinguished truth-seekers

389
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,960
want to know about the real hep cats
who hung out here,

390
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,417
in the "Harlem of the West,"

391
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,254
where a few of these homes did survive.

392
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:49,059
Like this beauty here,
which was built clear back in the 1800s.

393
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:54,056
Before the black thing,
this was all Japanese,

394
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,733
till FDR's stormtroopers
rounded them up into camps.

395
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,152
This house was built in the 1940s.

396
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,740
Say hi to our neighbor here, everybody.

397
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,826
Hi.

398
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:10,121
That would actually be
about 100 years late for this style.

399
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:13,245
We can see from his gingerbread trim,

400
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:17,170
this was built sometime in the 1850s.

401
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,339
Uh, 1946!

402
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,460
I'm gonna have to disagree
with you there, dude man.

403
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:27,797
No architect in the 1940s
was building in this style.

404
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,805
That's probably true,
but this wasn't built by an architect.

405
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,304
My grandfather built this.

406
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,941
He came here in World War Il,

407
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,520
he bought this lot,
and he built this house.

408
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,241
The stairs. These windows.

409
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,195
The columns. The archways.

410
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,159
The witch hat.

411
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,284
The balustrades. The fish scales.

412
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,373
This balcony.

413
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,501
That wall to keep y'all the fuck out.

414
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,584
All of it.

415
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:11,258
By Jimmie Fails I, with his own two hands.
In 1946.

416
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,306
Wow.

417
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,805
That's pretty amazing.

418
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,895
Well...

419
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,814
let's move on to our next stop.

420
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:27,069
The closet Patty Hearst
willfully hid herself in

421
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,275
before trotting on down...

422
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,485
What's good with that? What's going on?

423
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,790
Feel like the King of England.
King Jimmie. Wave.

424
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,117
Wave to the General.

425
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,037
- Hey, General.
- Yeah, but it's like a circle

426
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,293
with your... with your elbow.

427
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,251
Yeah, and then cup the air.
That's "cup the air".

428
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,961
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, that's good.

429
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,629
It's a beautiful house, Jim.

430
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,222
More beautiful than I could have imagined.

431
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:39,814
Yeah.

432
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,395
It's not quite there yet.

433
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,532
I mean, they left Dickens.

434
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,743
Charles Dickens.

435
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,453
Philistines, bro.

436
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,504
Frost! Plath!

437
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,041
Hughes!

438
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,924
Jimmie! Langston Hughes! They left him!

439
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,926
Bro!

440
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,226
Philistines!

441
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,365
Mont.

442
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Mont.

443
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,154
Wake up.

444
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,544
Got a plan.

445
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,153
It's crazy.

446
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,938
Last time I was here,
these weeds was taller than me.

447
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,368
- She's expecting us?
- Yes, sir.

448
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,500
- Auntie!
- Jimmie!

449
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,339
Yes!

450
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,047
Oh! So good to see you!

451
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,632
- You look good!
- Thank you.

452
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,308
- Hey!
- This is Mont.

453
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,886
Nice to meet you. Oh.

454
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,972
Y'all not hot? Like, you want...

455
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,919
- It's hot as hell out here.
- Take your jacket off.

456
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,479
Ain't nobody gonna steal your jacket.

457
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,603
This is a nice neighborhood.

458
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,362
Man, he better not break my damn board.

459
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,160
Shut up. You should be thanking him.

460
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,913
He's the one that helped me
pick out that board.

461
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,250
And besides...

462
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,665
sometimes it's just nice to watch.

463
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,675
Mmm.

464
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,513
Ricky, do that trick you used to do, baby.

465
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,768
Nice, baby.

466
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,222
Y'all hella cute.

467
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,806
Aw, thank you.

468
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,774
So, how much of this stuff
do you still have?

469
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,650
Really?

470
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,369
"How much of this stuff do you have?"

471
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,780
You just... No segue or nothin'?

472
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,577
You just came to see the stuff, huh?

473
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,156
Auntie, I got my first place.

474
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,583
Whoa.

475
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,421
Really?

476
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,335
- In the city?
- In the city.

477
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,131
Look at you!

478
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,052
Y'all must be doing pretty well
to afford a spot there.

479
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,088
Yeah, we got lucky.

480
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,593
- Mm-hmm.
- It's super empty, though.

481
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,188
Your daddy didn't send you here, right?

482
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,562
- No.
- You sure?

483
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,733
I swear to God.

484
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,740
'Cause I hope he's done
dragging you into his schemes.

485
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,403
Auntie, this is for us.

486
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,828
Okay.

487
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,295
Okay.

488
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,501
I'm proud of you, Jayboe.

489
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,921
- Really am.
- Thank you.

490
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,878
I miss that city.

491
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,422
Oh! Ooh!

492
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,929
You still look good, though, baby.

493
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,472
You still look good.

494
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,141
Mmm.

495
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,144
Oh, my goodness.

496
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,234
Mmm.

497
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,075
Damn, I knew you had some of it,
but is this everything?

498
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,862
Everything your dad didn't smoke up.

499
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,077
Sorry. Came out a little harsh.

500
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,575
I'm fine.

501
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,175
You really got all of this.

502
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,968
Yep!

503
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,263
Got as much as I could.

504
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,063
Open that.

505
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,440
That's amazing.

506
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,152
Yeah, I knew that,
out of everybody in this family,

507
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,488
you would be the one
to come looking for this stuff.

508
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,250
So...

509
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
I can...

510
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,919
Everything?

511
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,332
It's yours.

512
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,960
- Thank you.
- Hell, yeah.

513
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,260
Ricky, get the truck!

514
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,590
You guys good back there?

515
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,907
Bye. Thank you.

516
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,752
So, Ricky never lived in the house?

517
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,173
No, Wanda didn't meet him
until after we lost it.

518
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,293
You gonna poop or not?

519
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,729
Hello.

520
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,896
- Hello, sir.
- Hey!

521
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,183
I'm Jimmie Fails.
We haven't had the chance to meet yet.

522
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,942
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

523
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:02,983
Welcome to the neighborhood.

524
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,773
Yeah, oh, yes. Welcome.

525
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,192
Tim. Tim Ellory.

526
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,652
Sure, sure. Nice to meet you, man.

527
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:13,706
It's a fast-moving market.
I don't even remember a sign going up.

528
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,658
Oh, it didn't need to, but...

529
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,377
Look, Tim, I want you to know,

530
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,830
I'm gonna be the best damn neighbor
you ever had.

531
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,256
Well...
all right, Jimmie, thank you.

532
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,346
My pleasure.

533
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,717
Uh, well, you'll have to pardon me.

534
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,265
We've got lots to do, but...

535
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,218
- Of course, oh, yeah.
- Very nice to meet you, yeah.

536
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,816
What the fuck was that all about?

537
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,005
I wanna drink my coffee and scratch my ass
while I read the paper.

538
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,557
You don't read the paper, Jimmie.

539
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,429
'Cause I never had a home to read it in.

540
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,526
Shit.

541
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,652
We could throw parties.

542
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,185
You could put on one of your plays.

543
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,533
We could yell.

544
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,129
- The neighbors, Jimmie.
- Oh, the neighbors?

545
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,215
- Hmm.
- I got neighbors now.

546
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,431

560
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,795
On everything, bro.
Man, this kid was a straight sucker.

561
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,755
You lyin', bro. On everything, bro.
Straight sucker, bro.

562
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,201
- Tell him what happened.
- Man, last night, a white van pulled up.

563
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,182
This nigga Kofi ran like a straight bitch!

564
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,103
- He not lyin'!
- You niggas sayin' I ran? I didn't run!

565
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,929
Man, fuck what you niggas talkin' about.

566
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,186
Shut the fuck up, bro.
He's a straight sucker, bro.

567
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,004
Hey, man, he got us
looking like bitches, bro.

568
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,006
If I've gotta get on this thing,
I'm gonna be questioning you!

569
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,271
You supposed to be my cousin.

570
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,093
I'm-a bet you supposed to not run, nigga,
and that's what you supposed to do.

571
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,155
All right, all right,
all right, all right, bro.

572
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,578
All right, everybody shut up, bro.
Everybody shut up, bro.

573
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,871
Kofi, what happened, bro?

574
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,583
Tell him.

575
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,708
Uh...

576
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,830
Why?

577
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,371
- Tell him!
- Did you run, nigga?

578
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,336
Nah, I didn't run, nigga. I told you!

579
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,169
- Lyin', lyin'.
- Man, fuck you, nigga.

580
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,800
- Get on him.
- Wow.

581
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,974
- Hit me, bro.
- Man, what?

582
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,436
Hit me, bro.

583
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,396
Hit me, bro.

584
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,002
And for what? You supposed to be my folks.

585
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,562
Hey, Kof, hit that nigga, bro.

586
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,565
Yeah! Come on, bro!

587
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,989
Yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Get on him!

588
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,817
Hit me, bro! Hit me, bro!

589
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,029
- This nigga's a bitch!
- Hit me, man! Come on!

590
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,488
Guys! Guys!

591
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,707
Great, it's great.

592
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,331
Very good, very good.

593
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,043
Cut! Very good, very good.

594
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,633
Good, good, excellent.

595
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:21,847
Good. Hey, great news is
you're all doing marvelous work.

596
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,925
- What?
- Congratulations. It's not easy.

597
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,814
I believe you.

598
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,275
But I know it can be deeper.

599
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,444
- Fuck you talkin' about?
- Hey.

600
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,232
Remember Stanislavski.

601
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,869
- Fuck are you doin', man?
- Grotowski. Stanislavski.

602
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,537
Chekhov. Brecht.

603
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,615
- These are the greats.
- I'm confused, bro.

604
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,246
Weird ass.

605
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,177
You're okay there.

606
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,176
You're okay there.

607
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,430
Bro, you're not a director, bro.

608
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,751
Man,
take your weird ass outta here.

609
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,811
Keep building it.

610
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,420
I don't like when that nigga
come around here, bro.

611
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,048
- This nigga's a bitch.
- Say the word, I get on this nigga, bro!

612
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:24,951
Here we go.

613
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,889
Watch this for me real quick, bro.

614
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,640
I know.

615
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,565
I seen your cousin Al the other day.

616
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,528
I hear, "Hey, Uncle James!"

617
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,822
I look like, "Man, I don't know you.

618
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:51,656
Down there struttin' around,
like a Frisco fruit cup." Hmm.

619
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,663
I know his daddy mad as hell. Mm-mm-mm.

620
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,746
You still skateboarding?

621
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,549
Nah.

622
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,096
Hmm.

623
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,513
What?

624
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,768
Come here, help me cut these out.

625
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,561
And make sure the color bleeds
all the way through.

626
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,111
No white edges, all right?

627
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,693
Yes, sir. Same as always.

628
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,278
Yeah.

629
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,868
Same as always.

630
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,243
Hey, you remember that, uh,
warehouse we squatted at?

631
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,790
After we lived in the El Dorado?

632
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,332
We lost that 'cause
we didn't pay taxes, right?

633
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:42,790
Hell nah.
I paid our fair share of tax on that.

634
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,545
But who cares? Old drafty-ass roach nest.

635
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,094
Shit, it was that, or sleeping
on the street with your little ass.

636
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,763
Well, I appreciate it, Dad.

637
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,730
Mm-hmm.

638
00:46:57,857 --> 00:47:00,691
So, say I'm at a place now,

639
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,109
and the owners left it.

640
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,482
I'm gonna pay taxes on it.

641
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,439
You put gas and electric in your name?

642
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,451
Right, I'm gonna do that next.
You know I know.

643
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,530
Okay, doin' it like your old man.

644
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,333
That's good.

645
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,911
And nobody's come to check on it?

646
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,496
Nope. It's empty.

647
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,005
Good. That buys you time.

648
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,337
And they been gone three years?

649
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,256
Nah, just recently.

650
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,012
Wait, what?

651
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,936
You were workin' on it
while they were still in it?

652
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,311
Yeah.

653
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,725
Where is this house?

654
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,566
It's the house in Fillmore.

655
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:58,917
Wow.

656
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,293
Our old house.

657
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,136
What the fuck you mean, our old house?

658
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,058
Have you seen that house?

659
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,522
Well, yeah. I mean,
I be over there all the time.

660
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,607
Then you know that's not your old house

661
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,901
and that's not
your black-ass neighborhood.

662
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,034
Little disrespectful lyin' ass.

663
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,536
- What are you talking about?
- Nigga, I know you skateboard!

664
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,423
Yeah. Yeah, I see all that shit out there.

665
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,792
Everybody's little path.

666
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,346
I'm, like, 30 steps ahead of y'all.

667
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,307
Go on. Get!

668
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,818
You know we don't talk
about that house no more.

669
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,156
Put the shit down and go!

670
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,367
Hey, you been waiting here long?

671
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,995
Hella long, bro.

672
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,535

673
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,081

Wow.

695
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,486
A little room I used to come in
when my dad was doing his thing.

00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:07,618
It's cool, right?

00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,455
Yeah, man.

698
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,212
Did you see him today?

699
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,793
How'd it go?

700
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,384
He said this was a bad idea.

701
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,339
Thought you said he was an idiot.

702
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:31,514
Nah, he's just mad
'cause he lost the house.

703
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,400
But what if we shouldn't be here?

704
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,688
Who should be here more?

705
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,367
Hmm?

706
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,159
Some millionaire?

707
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,870
They'd want it 'cause it looks nice.

708
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,706
You're the reason it looks nice, Jim.

709
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,670
I don't know.

710
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,259
What the fuck?

711
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,433
I invited somebody.

712
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,563
What's good, nigga?
Glad you could make it.

713
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,274
What's goin' on?

714
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,535
Be back in a sec. Pardon me.

715
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,162
Y'all got an organ?

716
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,133
Columns and shit.

717
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,818
It's just y'all here?

718
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:09,740
Yeah.

719
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,748
It just makes noises.

720
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,246
Oh, okay.

721
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,414
It's nice to see you in that chair.
I didn't know you'd pick that one.

722
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,499
Thanks a lot, bro.

723
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,004
Kinda awkward, but this place is cool.

724
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,057
Yeah.
Jimmie's been doing a lot to fix it up.

725
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,384
How'd y'all get this?

726
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:34,686
It's Jimmie's.

727
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,021
His grandpa built it.

728
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,561
He was the first black man
in San Francisco.

729
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,938
That's what they call him anyways.

730
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,779
Oh, shit.

731
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,282
- This that house?
- Hmm.

732
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,655
Hey, Jimmie used to talk
about this spot all the time.

733
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,217
But you know how niggas be
in the group home.

734
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,083
Overexaggerating and shit.

735
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,212
Trying to be all special.

736
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,250
You weren't lying about
this one, though, huh, Jimmie?

737
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,048
You were in a group home?

738
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,052
Yeah.

739
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:14,725
For, like, a year.

740
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,063
Yep.

741
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,394
You guys wanna go for a schvitz?

742
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,985
A what?

743
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,419
Wait, your grandfather made this, too?

744
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,509
Nah. Nah, these white people did.

745
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,087
Uh-huh.

746
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,302
Well, how you know
he was the first one, though?

747
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,429
This nigga be lyin'.

748
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,136
Bro, he came over here
from New Orleans.

749
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,479
There was hella Japanese people, bro.

750
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:04,101
And then they got thrown
into little war camps,

751
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,481
and he wasn't tryin' to move
into nobody else's shit.

752
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,188
So he built this, bro.

753
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,527
This is great.

754
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,282
You still skate, bro?

755
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,243
Nah.

756
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,533
No, I don't skate no more.

757
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,870
Oh, shit, I mean,
you used to be hella raw.

758
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,080
Yeah.

759
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,549
Not no more.

760
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,760
Hey, you remember Gunna?

761
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,213
Remember when he got caught
stealing from the candy lady?

762
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,552
Yeah, he's an ugly-ass crier.

763
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,012
Oh, man.

764
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,390
Hurt as fuck!

765
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:48,027
Hey, remember, uh, Miss Homer,
the one that ran the group home?

766
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,900
- Oh, yeah!
- And she cut that nigga hair.

767
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,858
Had his line crooked hella much!

768
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,534
"Know damn well
that white lady couldn't cut no hair!"

769
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,122
Had that nigga's shit lookin'
like Lombard.

770
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,748
That nigga said Lomb...

771
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,297
Ah, man, you niggas gonna
make me piss on myself.

772
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,591
Oh, shit, y'all got a bathroom
up in here, man?

773
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,090
- In this big-ass house?
- It's down the hall.

774
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,513
It's the room
with the little claw-foot tub.

775
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,092
All right.
This cool as shit, big-ass house.

776
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,886
Man...

777
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,389
I wish I had a grandpa like you.

778
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,440
Leave me some shit like this.

779
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,484
This shit's enjoyable.

780
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,107
Right on, bro.

781
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,189
I'm proud of you niggas. You too, Mont.

782
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,116
Crazy-ass.

783
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,036
Just living the life, man.

784
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,822
Y'all niggas really done made it, man.

785
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,292
Ah, shit, I'm gonna go use

786
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,370
You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie.

787
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,965
"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

788
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,981
You should, uh...

789
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,935
You should have your own room, bro.

790
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,991
That's okay, Jim.

791
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,539
Nah, seriously, man.

792
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,288
I been in your space forever.

793
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,628
This place is yours, too.

794
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,591
Any room?

795
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,659
How about this one?

796
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,964
Are you sure you want the dining room?

797
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,210
Yeah.

798
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:11,964
It's perfect.

799
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,172
Dream big, bro.

800
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,347
It's yours.

801
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,653
Um, yeah, we're gonna
have to figure something out.

802
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,113
I don't have that much time.

803
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,908
It's a complicated situation.

804
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,158
No, the power's been on.
I just need the bill in my name.

805
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,584
Uh-huh.

806
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,997
Okay, great.
Well, when will I get the first invoice?

807
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,630
And you can't mail that any sooner?

808
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,302
All right, yeah.

809
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,057
He's talking about paying some bills.

810
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,265
'Cause I wouldn't say no
if he offered to chip in a little more.

811
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,108
He already pays half, Grandpa.

812
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,984
Well, he's been here
for a while, you know?

813
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,024
And he is not exactly family.

814
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:24,945
I think he knows that.

815
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,116
Let's hope so.

816
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,994
What's all this noise up in here?

817
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,224
I'm just packing some stuff.

818
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,162
It's for a project.

819
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,502
Since when?

820
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,969
I mean, we haven't even talked
about the characters yet.

821
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,344
- You know how much I like that.
- Yeah, well, I'm still working on it.

822
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,054
Don't quite have a plot yet.

823
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:52,055
Well, we can brainstorm a little bit.

824
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,099
You know,
that's where I think we the best at.

825
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,525
When we brainstorming.

826
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:01,856
I think I gotta brainstorm
this one by myself right now.

827
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,785
But I'd love to talk about it soon.

828
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:10,956
You about ready, bro?

829
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,420
Mm-hmm.

830
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,130
Well, um...

831
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,419
whatever it is, uh...

832
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:27,424
I'm proud of you.

833
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,556
- Wow, look at him.
- What type of shoes are those?

834
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,767
Yeah, you should start
rocking like that, bra-bra.

835
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,568
What the fuck is up with your hat, Jimmie?

836
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,987
You look like a human cigarette.
I can't handle it.

837
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:46,283
Jimmie, is that a bowling ball?
It's the black Alice in Wonderland.

838
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:50,409
Hey, Monty, I heard you be whippin' out
that little weenie on all the girls.

839
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,665
Bro, with that hair,
you look like a Simpson.

840
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,244
Nigga, shut up, bro,
your one-shirt-havin' ass.

841
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,206
Jimmie, you wear the same shirt
every motherfuckin' day.

842
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,586
You look like a fiend, Jimmie. Come on!

843
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,009
Hey, just like your daddy!

844
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,384
I remember your crackhead-ass daddy.

845
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,340
And your dope-fiend-ass mom.

846
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,892
Family of fiends, dawg.

847
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,265
I done sold him a rock
back in the day.

848
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,597
Hey, what you got up in there?

849
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,932
Some lace curtains for that whole
beautifyin'-ass house

850
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:19,858
that y'all been makin' up and shit?

851
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,562
Okay, Kofi! Okay, what else?

852
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,634
These niggas the other day,
they pulled up the other day.

853
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:28,151
Niggas had all types of feminine shit
goin' on in that house, bro.

854
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,827
Jimmie, what two men do that?

855
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:33,281
Just 'cause you in that big-ass house,
you not better than us, Jimmie.

856
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,583
- Never.
- You're not better than us.

857
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:38,349
Hey, what is those, lace curtains
you gonna beautify the house with?

858
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,879
Come on, man, soft-ass nigga.

859
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,674
I know who you is, Jimmie. Remember!

860
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,613
Hey, you know what y'all need to do?

861
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:48,175
Y'all need to disappear
like a motherfuckin' magic trick, nigga!

862
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,758
Rabbit out the hat. Get the fuck out here.
Fuck outta here!

863
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,557
Jimmie! Jimmie! Go home!

864
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,448
You're really drawing them?

865
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,580
They just talk shit.

866
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,539
Well, you talked shit when I met you.

867
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,548
I did?

868
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,383
You did.

869
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,011
It's fine, though.

870
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,264
Why'd you hang out with me, then?

871
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,810
You care about things. I liked you.

872
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,783
You really don't give a fuck
what anybody says?

873
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:57,073
I shouldn't get to appreciate them
'cause they're mean to me?

874
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,911
That's silly.

875
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,002
Oh.

876
01:05:58,705 --> 01:05:59,866
What are you doing here?

877
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,787
What are you ever doing here?

878
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,248
Uh...

879
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,796
didn't you move out, though?

880
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,217
Yeah.

881
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,344
They changed the fuckin' locks on me.

882
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,635
I'm sorry. That sucks.

883
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,814
What do you want, man?

884
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,561
How long you gonna be here?

885
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:35,652
I don't know yet. I'm just tryin' to...

886
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:38,950
let go.

887
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,703
Okay, well...

888
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,957
I guess we'll just
come back tomorrow, then.

889
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,247
Great.

890
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,295
That's nice.

891
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,632
Come on, Jim.
We'll go to my house.

892
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,304
In this crazy fuckin' city,
you're still here.

893
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,110
Man, those damn kids
dropping bubble gum all over the place.

894
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,189
It'll get all over your seat, man.
You know what I'm sayin'?

895
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,692
Think she'll stay there all night?

896
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,615
Watch, we'll come back
and she'll be painting the windowsill.

897
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,299
Yes, baby. Yes, I will be there.

898
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,949
I've been clean for three years.
I know where those meetings are.

899
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,717
All right, you got it.
I'll be there 15 minutes early.

900
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,057
Yes. Yes, I told...

901
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,438
Jayboe?

902
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,776
Jayboe.

903
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,397
Uh...

904
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,358
- Hi, Mom.

905
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:04,995

907
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,657
- Hi.

908
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:15,627
Um, yeah. Uh, I'm sorry.

909
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:18,334
- That's all right.
- I thought you and Ron were in LA.

910
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:20,984
Oh, no, we been back for three months now.

911
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,474
Uh, this is my friend, Mont.

912
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,937
Oh, hi. Excuse me, I'm Jimmie's mom.
Nice to meet you.

913
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,434
Pleasure to meet you.

01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,186

You should stop by.
You know, come check it out.

918
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,905
Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

919
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,029
The house, my dad's old house.

920
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,203
- Oh, your family house on Golden Gate?
- Yeah.

921
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,249
Okay. Well, I got your number.
I'll call you.

922
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,701
Try to come over there tomorrow.

923
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,037
Oh, I don't have a phone.

924
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,462
Well, I just have to come over there,
then.

925
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,544
What's the best time to come?

926
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,254

Okay. Cool, I'll be there tomorrow.

Well, it was good

01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,501
Yeah, bye. Uh...

01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,591
Why? Why?

942
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,092
What happened?

943
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,673
Why?

944
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:25,670
What the fuck?

945
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,262
What happened?

946
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,362
- What the fuck happened?
- He got shot.

947
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,155
They shot him.

948
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,701
Who? Who shot him?

949
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:55,876
Who?

950
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,709
Bay niggas.

951
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,162
For what?

952
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,006
For what?

953
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,226
He was talking shit
to the wrong niggas.

954
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,673
Tried to bluff some niggas out.

955
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,388
Tried to bluff them out?

956
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,937
Man, what's with all the questions, bro?

957
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:20,565

You finna let him say that?

969

<i>That poor boy and his friends.</i>

970
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,590
I'm sorry, Jimmie.

971
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,755
I hope I never made you feel like
you weren't welcome here.

972
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,934
No, I... I never felt like that.

973
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,770
'Cause I don't care where you been.

974
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,860
You don't have to tell me.

975
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:53,777
It's just, you two... stick together.

976
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,126
You know, I was writing a play about him.

977
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,888
You don't have to stop now.

978
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,358
"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

979
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,829
I know it sounds weird, but...

980
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,371
I kinda feel like that could've been me.

981
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,665
If not for the house.

982
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,686
Man, I wanna go home.

983
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,160
Filthy, fishy salt water.

984
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:32,049
Water been funkier
than the devil's mouth for 50 years.

985
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,251
Now they wanna clean it up.

986
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,462
<i>They've got plans for us.</i>

987
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,892
We was made to be put through hell.

988
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:46,396
Purified. We was made
to be put through hell.

989
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:49,725
Be purified.

990
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:03,704
Fuck!

991
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,287
Oh, God.

992
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,336
Fuck!

993
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,638
How did she toss all of our shit?

994
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,174
I don't think it was her.

995
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,122
Fuckin' traitor.

996
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,305
Okay.

997
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,878
Can you stay here and watch the shit?

998
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,394
Yeah, where you going?

999
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,773
- Where you going?
- I'll be back.

1000
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,526
I'll be back.

1001
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,404
Jimmie!

1002
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,205
Sorry, uh, how can I help you today?

1003
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,172
Uh...

1004
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,550
- I want to buy a house.
- A house?

1005
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,553
That's exciting.
Uh, are you working with an agent?

1006
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,511
No. Do I need to?

1007
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,227
No.

1008
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:51,305
Not necessarily. Um...
do you have a price range in mind?

1009
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,764
I have a house in mind.

1010
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,478
Oh.

1011
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,272
Um...

1012
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:58,979
it's on the market, I assume?

1013
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,109
How much are they asking?

1014
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,525
At least four million.

1015
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:07,905
Uh, and how much
are you willing to put down?

1016
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,036
How much is usual?

1017
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,746
Well, typically, we'd be looking
to secure at least 20%.

1018
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,547
I wouldn't have that.

1019
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,469
That's understandable.

1020
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,520
It's going to be hard
to land a place like that.

1021
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,894
But suppose I ask instead, uh...

1022
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,021
No, no, look.

1023
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,524
I get it.

1024
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:44,195
I'm young. Uh, I'm black.

1025
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:46,235
I'm not rich.

1026
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,200
I came here knowing all that.

1027
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:51,831
But let's be real.
You also got a quota to meet.

1028
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,371
- Now, I'm not calling you a predator.
- Sir.

1029
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:55,689
But you're trying to make your money.

1030
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:57,649
- So let me help you do that.
- Sir, that's not the way this works.

1031
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,553
You can give me whatever deal you
gotta give me. I don't care what it is.

1032
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,505
'Cause unlike all the other people
that default,

1033
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,880
this is the only house I'll ever want.

1034
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,175
So I'll never miss a monthly bill, ever.

1035
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,807
You can give me
your highest interest rate.

1036
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:14,583
You can give me your highest
interest rate, okay?

1037
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,564
- Fuck me.
- No, I completely...

1038
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,210
You don't even have to feel bad.
You don't even have to feel bad.

1039
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,484
Okay? I will pay back every single cent.

1040
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:27,154
I'm sorry, sir.

1041
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:29,987
I will pay back every single cent.

1042
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:35,663
Okay, okay, you win!

1043
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,915
Okay, yep, it's yours.

1044
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:41,001
You charming bastard. Okay.

1045
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,003
Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.

1046
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:47,220
- How's it going, man?
- Fine, sir.

1047
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,387
I noticed the house we discussed
is now for sale.

1048
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,624
There are some alarming elements
in your literature

1049
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,184
I thought you would like to know.

1050
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,575
And certainly the Bureau
of Real Estate would.

1051
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,319
Uh-huh.

1052
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:06,440
This claims the property has a view
of the Golden Gate.

1053
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:09,116
Which... I don't think is true.

1054
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,620
Well, it isn't. It isn't true.

1055
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:16,450
It also claims to have all the original
fixtures, floors, and faucets.

1056
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:17,829
Isn't true.

1057
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,400
And are you planning on disclosing
that there's no septic tank?

1058
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,290
Which means, any day now,

1059
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,923
the garden could be flooded... with shit.

1060
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,639
Where's this going, man?

1061
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:33,434
Well...

1062
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:37,016
all this together seems
like false advertisement.

1063
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,272
Which is grounds for void of sale.

1064
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:41,395
Potential revoke of license.

1065
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:42,942
I thought it might've been you guys.

1066
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,445
What's your deal, man?

1067
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,034
Don't have a deal.

1068
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,454
Hmm. Look...

1069
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,576
somebody on this floor would've
gotten that house if it wasn't me.

1070
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,004
At least I'm from here, right?

1071
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:07,509
I put your stuff on the street as a favor.

1072
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,335
- Okay.
- I could've had it trucked away,

1073
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,591
but I left it out for you.

1074
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:14,766
Look, dick wad.
I'm not fucking around. I will report you.

1075
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:19,142
For what? Listing a view of the bridge?
And fixtures?

1076
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:22,770
Everybody does that.
I literally copy-pasted that shit.

1077
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,820
Well, you're lying about
the history of the house.

1078
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:27,376
- I'm not lying about that.
- Yes, you are!

1079
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:30,274
You say it was built 100 years earlier
than it actually was.

1080
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,903
Look, I'm not making this up.

1081
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,360
Yes, you are!

1082
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,946
James Fails built this house in 1946.

1083
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,622
- James?
- Fails!

1084
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,268
What are you talking about?

1085
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,451
Look, man.

1086
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,043
Deed of Trust, 1857.

1087
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,841
Architect Gil-hoo-ley, some shit.

1088
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,588
Your guy Fails lost it in the '90s.

1089
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:55,215
See? Right there.

1090
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:00,770
Look, man. If you need a week to find
somewhere else, then take it.

1091
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:07,065
But... don't go pulling some
squatters rights shit on me, man.

1092
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,025
I got your mail.

1093
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:13,323
I know your name.

1094
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,489
I don't want to call the cops.

1095
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:18,321
I don't want to do that to you.

1096
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,507
Where'd you go?

1097
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,386
Doesn't matter, bro.

1098
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:21,430
I got everything inside. Except the couch.

1099
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:24,975
That shit almost fell on me.

1100
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:30,695
Jim...

1101
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:33,942
I spoke to the Realtor.

1102
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:35,694
Yeah, fuck that guy.

1103
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,656
He's gonna throw us out.

1104
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,326
And eventually call the cops.

1105
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,248
I don't know how much longer
we can keep doing this.

1106
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,877
I understand if you can't.

1107
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,011
I do.

1108
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,761
But I'm not leaving.

1109
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,977
- Jim, he said your grand...
- Where am I gonna go?

1110
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,360
My dad's in the SRO.

1111
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,399
My aunt's out in bum fuck.

1112
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:20,989
My mom...

1113
01:23:22,623 --> 01:23:26,037
Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

1114
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,460
I'm not leaving, bro.

1115
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,083
I'm the last one left.

1116
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:42,928
We have my house.

1117
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,472
I can't go back there, bro.

1118
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:58,190
Mont, this house...

1119
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:01,526
This is what I do.

1120
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:04,579
Hey, it's what we do, Mont.

1121
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,491
This is our shit.

1122
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:09,834
We can't give up now.

1123
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:11,790
We gotta fight.

1124
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,007
Right?

1125
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,425
Yeah.

1126
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,101
I'm with you, bro.

1127
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,562
You always been with me.

1128
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:56,659
Oh, shit, you're writing?

1129
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,586
Yeah. Uh... I think I cracked a play.

1130
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,058
I'd like to put it on next week,
if that's all right.

1131
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:11,938
Hell, yeah, get it, bro.

How'd you write all this that fast?

1153
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:56,542
There's more.

1154
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,750

Mont?

1165
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:58,975
Hella fuckin' early.

1166
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:04,026
Here we go.

1167
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:17,286
Why are you dressed like a white boy?

1168
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,290
Oh.

1169
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,546
It's for your little show, huh?

1170
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:48,104
Man.

1171
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,788
You mess up my daddy's chair, Montgomery?

1172
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:01,502
Huh?

1173
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:04,667
No. No, sir, we... we were just...

1174
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:08,215
What you stuttering for?
You got stage fright already? Huh?

1175
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,380
No.

1176
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,138
I don't care about the chair, son.

1177
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:19,935
But be easy with it.

1178
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,222
Thank you.

1179
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,312
Carry on.

1180
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:00,760
Phew.

1181
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,982
My daddy hated when I played that shit.

1182
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:19,908
Yeah, come on in. Don't be shy.

1183
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,623
His grandpa built it.

1184
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,792
Not bad for a black man, huh?

1185
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,791
Oh, no.

1186
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:30,123
Very good. Very good.

1187
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:40,554
So, this is gonna be interesting.
This is nice.

1188
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,557
- Nice crowd, too.
- Yeah.

1189
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,388
You make a lot of money on candy?

1190
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:47,473
Sell candy?

1191
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,274
- I used to, for years.
- Oh, yeah?

1192
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:52,775
Most of these new white people
moving in these black neighborhoods,

1193
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:56,323
they don't even know they standing
in the kitchen where a dude got shot at.

1194
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:57,409
Hmm.

1195
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:59,174
I didn't know
he was doing a play and shit.

1196
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,445
He just invited us,

1197
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,531
I don't know what weird shit
they got goin' on, but it's pretty weird.

1198
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,908
What I'm-a hit you for?

1199
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:19,843
You my folks.

1200
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,305
All right.

1201
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:26,352
All right.

1202
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,690
But I can't have soft niggas
hanging around me.

1203
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,570
Hit me.

1204
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:39,491
Nah!

1205
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,201
Nah! For what, nigga?

1206
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,404
Hit me.

1207
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:46,494
Man up, nigga. Man up!

1208
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:51,837
No, bro! No! No, bro, no!

1209
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:55,299
Oh, you soft.

1210
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,669
You soft, nigga.

1211
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,131
They gonna call you a bitch
at your funeral.

1212
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:05,764
I ain't no bitch!
I ain't no bitch! I'm a man!

1213
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,014
Then hit me.

1214
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:10,227
Hit me, bro. Hit me.

1215
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,188
Hit me, nigga.

1216
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,739
All right! All right!

1217
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:30,326
Yeah! Here, nigga. I don't give a fuck.

1218
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,630
Come see me, nigga.
Who out there hiding, hmm?

1219
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,799
Man up! Man up, nigga!

1220
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:37,966
- Man up!
- Hey!

1221
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,935
No words. No words!

1222
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:51,181
Please send e-hugs.

1223
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,067

01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,904
Damn! Just smoked with you the other day!

1227
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:09,365
Crazy!

1228
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:11,996
John Bishop.

1229

Two hundred and sixty likes. Ten shares.

1230
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:21,385
Are these the people who knew Kofi?

1231
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:27,349
Got yelled at by my bitch boss
for being late!

1232
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,020
Sorry! There's no timer for grief.

1233
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:35,521
Leah Tanaka, 320 likes.

1234
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,436
Man!

1235
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,523
Man! Can't believe we lost my bro!

1236
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:48,530
But you wouldn't want me to be sad, Ko,
so I put my pain into my music!

1237
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,865
Make sure you like the post.

Ro-Ro-Ro-Rodney Tuck.

1239

Mr. Tuck moved to Florida ten years ago!

1240
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:03,677
Are these the people who knew Kofi?

1241
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:08,261
Kofi had dimensions.

1242
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:13,517
More than a... a post could reflect
or a play could capture.

1243
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:17,191
So I summon you.

1244
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:21,236
Celebrate the life he lived.

1245
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:23,439
Not through those who speak the loudest.

1246
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:25,820
But through the memories he left us all.

1247
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:28,615
Ma'am!

1248
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,912
- Me?
- Hmm. How will you...

1249
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,991
How will you remember Kofi?

1250
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:38,586
Um...

1251
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:41,798
Um...

1252
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:47,755
he, you know, he used to come
and walk my niece home from school

1253
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:50,011
when she first moved up here.

1254
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,521
He was a little gentleman, or whatnot,
you know, sweet, um...

1255
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,099
It's just sad.

1256
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:00,310
Mmm.

1257
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:04,529
- I coached Kofi in Pop Warner.
- Mm-hmm.

1258
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:08,906
He stayed behind and helped me pack up
every day.

1259
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:11,449
Yeah.

1260
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,077
And how about you, young man?

1261
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:22,423
Shit, man.

1262
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,171
I don't know.

1263
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,096
Did I push him too hard?

1264
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:32,724
Kofi was my nigga, man.

1265
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,230
Did I push him too hard?

1266
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,111
Bro.

1267
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,691
Hmm. How about you?

1268
01:35:56,084 --> 01:35:57,291
Well...

1269
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:03,999
my last memory of Kofi
was him talking shit to me.

1270
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:10,508
He said some of the most fucked-up shit
anybody's ever said to me.

1271
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:16,263
But Kofi also got jumped

1272
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:19,101
for defending me against the older kids
in the group home.

1273
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,269
He didn't like to fight, but...

1274
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,228
he fought for me then.

1275
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:29,990
People aren't one thing.

1276
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:41,035
That.

1277
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:46,252
All...

1278
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:48,296
All of it.

1279
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,175
What would have happened...

1280
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:58,303
if Kofi could've... showed himself?

1281
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:02,022
All forms of himself.

1282
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:06,477
The world...

1283
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,238
put him in a box!

1284
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:15,491
And he never... pushed beyond it.

1285
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:21,120
Let us.

1286
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,582
Let us break the boxes!

1287
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:29,626
Let us give each other
the courage to-to see!

1288
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:33,133
Beyond the stories we are born into!

1289
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:38,893
Let us all really look

1290
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:42,062
at Jimmie Fails IV.

1291
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:52,485
Self-taught historian.

1292
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,112
Carpenter.

1293
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,537
Gentle, loving man.

1294
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:00,990
A true survivor. Jimmie!

1295
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:02,950
How many places have you lived?

1296
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:07,755
And if they kicked you out tomorrow,
you would still be all those things!

1297
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,708
You exist beyond the... these walls.

1298
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:14,671
You extend beyond your... your forefathers!

1299
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:16,971
You're not this house!

1300
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:19,425
Jimmie, you are not these... these walls!

1301
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:21,288
You're not these floors,
you're not this ceiling!

1302
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,304
- It's time you know!
- Bro, what are you doing?

1303
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:24,750
- What are you doing?
- It is time!

1304
01:38:24,774 --> 01:38:26,574
- It is time you know!
- I don't need to know.

1305
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:29,101
I don't need to know.
Let's stop. Let's stop.

1306
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:34,440
- Jimmie, you don't need...
- Enough, stop!

1307
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:36,116
- Please, stop. Mont!
- Jimmie!

1308
01:38:36,202 --> 01:38:38,410
- Your grandpa didn't build this house!
- Enough!

1309
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,582
He didn't build it, Jimmie!

1310
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:55,795
Yes, he did.

1311
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,431
He built this house!

1312
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:02,180
He didn't. I saw it, man. I saw the deed.

1313
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:06,431
I saw it.

1314
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,470
I don't know
what the hell that thing was.

1315
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:58,448
Then he shoots a left. Psh!

1316
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,400
Ha!

1317
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,782
Man, let 'em leave.

1318
01:40:02,872 --> 01:40:04,989
They don't deserve to be in here anyway.

1319
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:11,582
Neither do we.

1320
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:19,382
You gonna really let some old-ass nigga
tell you what's true?

1321
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:23,882
Come on, Jayboe.
Get your spine up, Son.

1322
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,802
- Have some pride, man.
- I've been doin'.

1323
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:36,611
But you say it.

1324
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:39,857
Say what?

1325
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:43,489
The truth.

1326
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:45,780
What?

1327
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:48,990
That grandpa didn't build this house.

1328
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:54,289
Man, get outta here with that bullshit.
Come on, Jayboe.

1329
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:02,012
Just say it.

1330
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:17,861
Can't tell you shit.

1331
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:22,449
I'm outta here, man.

1332
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:25,201
You sit in that bullshit if you want.

1333
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,251
Jayboe.

1334
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:07,929
I been telling people
he built it for so long.

1335
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:15,303
Almost forgot it wasn't true.

1336
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,819
This was ours.

1337
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:25,113
And then it wasn't.

1338
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:31,654
So you just tell yourself what you need
to make you feel like it still is.

1339
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:36,120
Shit.

1340
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:38,452
I did it, too.

1341
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,467
It makes you feel...

1342
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:48,420
special.

1343
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:55,473
But you got a chance to get out
from underneath all of that now.

1344
01:43:57,857 --> 01:43:59,223
I don't want to.

1345
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:02,938
I just want it.

1346
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:08,364
Is that what you really want?

1347
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:15,288
To spend the rest of your life
working for this?

1348
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:18,082
Fighting for this?

1349
01:44:22,298 --> 01:44:25,917
I believe that you could make
this place yours.

1350
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,171
I really do.

1351
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:36,221
But if you leave...

1352
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:42,186
it's not your loss.

1353
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:46,232
It's San Francisco's.

1354
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,827
Fuck San Francisco.

1355
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:38,874
- This city blows.
- Big time.

1356
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:40,038
I mean, whatever.

1357
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:43,452
I'm not above living in a former
crack house, you know?

1358
01:45:43,546 --> 01:45:46,038
But I came here for Janis
and the Airplane,

1359
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:48,464
not to work at a fucking start-up.

1360
01:45:48,551 --> 01:45:51,965
Dude, I've been saying for months,
let's just move to East LA.

1361
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:53,261
This city's dead.

1362
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:55,422
Yeah.

1363
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:56,973
Seriously, fuck this city.

1364
01:45:58,978 --> 01:46:00,094
Excuse me?

1365
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:05,140
You don't get to hate San Francisco.

1366
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:10,028
I'm sorry, what?

1367
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:14,615
Yeah, dude, I mean,
sorry, but I'll hate what I want.

1368
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:18,324
Do you love it?

1369
01:46:20,749 --> 01:46:22,866
It's... I mean, yeah, I'm here.

1370
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:25,418
But do I have to love it?

1371
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:28,959
You don't get to hate it
unless you love it.

1372
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:33,968
Classic Muni shit.

1373
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:46,435
Who call the money man?
Come on now, hurry up.

1374
01:46:46,525 --> 01:46:47,732
Pay attention!

1375
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:52,020
Alexander the Great was a black man.

1376
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:54,606
They don't teach you that
in the devil school system.

1377
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,319
I can't take another day of this bullshit.

1378
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:08,475
Oh, Jim.

1379
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:16,483
I'm sorry I did that.

1380
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:20,533
It was a stupid play.

1381
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:25,155
Nah.

1382
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:28,746
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

1383
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:34,463
I just wanted it to be true.

1384
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:38,210
It felt so good, you know?

1385
01:48:44,685 --> 01:48:45,801
It's okay.

1386
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:08,077
Hey, Jimmie. Are you hungry?

1387
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:10,575
Fucking starving.

1388
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:17,127
He's giving up.

1389
01:49:18,343 --> 01:49:20,209
I can't take no more.

1390
01:49:21,138 --> 01:49:23,596
- He's breaking down.
- Oh, wow.

1391
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,660
He's really tearing this apartment apart.

1392
01:49:27,352 --> 01:49:29,435
This looks exciting, though, you know?

1393
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:32,518
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.
- Yeah? Oh, yeah?

1394
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:37,315
- Oh! I got it now.
- Oh!

1395
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:39,020
He seems like he's horny or something.

1396
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:46,948
He's banging on the door again.
