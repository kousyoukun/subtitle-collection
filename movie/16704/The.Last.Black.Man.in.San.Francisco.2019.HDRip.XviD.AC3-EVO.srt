2
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:11,654
Jasmine?

3
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:16,291
Jasmine!
We gonna be late, come on.

4
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:19,292
Let's go.

5
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:21,463
Why do they have
on these suits and we don't?

6
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,432
Something's going on
right in our face.

7
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:27,601
You're so stuck
on those iPhones,

8
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:30,003
J phone 12s or whatever,

9
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:31,874
blow up in your hand.

10
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:36,476
You can't Google
what's going on right now.

11
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,514
Are y'all paying attention?

12
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:44,051
Why do they have on
these suits if we don't?

13
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:45,421
Why?

14
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:48,791
They here to clean this water?

15
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,726
When this water been dirtier
than the Devil's mouth

16
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:54,393
for 50 years.

17
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:55,464
And now they want to clean it?

18
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:58,964
They got plans for us, man.

19
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:01,768
Looking like
George Jetson rejects.

20
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,039
'Cause they weak!

21
00:02:03,838 --> 00:02:05,471
Weak hearts!

22
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:07,441
Weak lungs!

23
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,979
Can't even breathe up here
without a mask.

24
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,919
But we was put through Hell
to be purified.

25
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:21,555
You know what I'm sayin',
brothers and sisters?

26
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:24,524
Man, it's crazy what
jail will do to a nigga.

27
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,525
They don't care
about they water, man,

28
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:27,793
there's something going on,

29
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,562
we gonna get
to the bottom of it.

30
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:32,031
And they lucky
I'm a man of God right now.

31
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:34,033
You think he rehearses this
every morning?

32
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:36,669
Or they
would catch these hands.

33
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:39,038
Seems a bit more impromptu.

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,906
2019 out here!

35
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,609
We been yellin'
about this water

36
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,414
since before they were born.

37
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,550
Before they were born!

38
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:52,119
Where's this bus, man?
We're not gonna make it.

39
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:54,587
Y'all
leave us the hell alone.

40
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:56,823
Unless y'all really here
to help us.

41
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:58,557
We'll get there.

42
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,092
They
got plans for us, man.

43
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:01,595
We're not gonna make it, bro.

44
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:02,829
Not for you and me.

45
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:03,964
So I urge you!

46
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,002
Fight for your land!

47
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,502
Fight for your home!

48
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:12,508
- Fight for your...
- Let's skate.

49
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:25,922
<i>This here?</i>

50
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,889
<i>This is the edge, bro!</i>

51
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,894
<i>The final frontier
of Manifest Destiny.</i>

52
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,464
<i>Last edge of the city.</i>

53
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:38,632
<i>Man, two steps further,</i>

54
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:40,903
<i>you'll be drinking
that filthy saltwater.</i>

55
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,937
<i>But we built these ships.</i>

56
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,073
<i>Dredged these canals.</i>

57
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:50,580
<i>In the San Francisco
they never knew existed.</i>

58
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:03,159
<i>And now they come
to build something new?</i>

59
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:09,966
<i>Whole blocks half in the past,
half in the future.</i>

60
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,936
<i>But should you venture
into their San Francisco,</i>

61
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:18,140
<i>the one they pillaged
for gold!</i>

62
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,708
<i>Remember your truth!</i>

63
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,813
<i>In the city of facades.</i>

64
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,595
Take me with you!

65
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:18,564
Hey! Hey!

66
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,599
Take me with you, man!

67
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:21,934
Come on, where are we going?

68
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:25,772
Where are we going?

69
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:28,211
Come on, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

70
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:37,284
<i>Look
at them look at you.</i>

71
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:39,121
<i>Look down at you.</i>

72
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:41,824
<i>But we built them!</i>

73
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,760
<i>We are these homes!</i>

74
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,896
<i>Their eyes...</i>

75
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,565
<i>Their pointed brims...</i>

76
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,103
<i>We move if they move.</i>

77
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:59,541
<i>Our sweat soaked in the wood.</i>

78
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,613
<i>Gilded in our image.</i>

79
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:09,719
<i>This is our home!</i>

80
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:12,722
<i>Our home!</i>

81
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,226
<i>Our home.</i>

82
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:22,931
Thanks.

83
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:28,871
Are you sure they're gone?

84
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:44,751
Jim?

85
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:46,322
I mean,
their car is gone.

86
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:50,657
Let's check the back, man.

87
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,758
Good morning.

88
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,928
How are you?

89
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,198
Remember that time
they were in the kitchen?

90
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,135
Jim!

91
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,604
Remember the kitchen?

92
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:05,073
Yeah, sure.

93
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:07,909
But, bruh...

94
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:10,210
Didn't I tell you

95
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,281
these railings are
periwinkle, not black.

96
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,284
Mmm-hmm.

97
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:18,721
Yeah, I got it.

98
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,190
We gotta start coming more
than every two weeks, bro.

99
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:30,330
This fuckin' garden's
a nightmare.

100
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:32,898
I'll bring my grandpa's
tools next time.

101
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,102
Please do.

102
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:48,116
Wallpaper's chipping.

103
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,886
These people
are killing this house.

104
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,921
You're not
goin' in though.

105
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:55,992
Jim?

106
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,661
I mean...

107
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,361
I mean...

108
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,632
No?

109
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,434
They're definitely
gone, though.

110
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:10,003
Better be quick
this time. Hmm?

111
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,040
Yeah, I know.

112
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:12,908
Takes time.

113
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:15,174
Yeah, I know.

114
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:17,010
I'll be
at my spot.

115
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,113
All right.

116
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:22,114
Quick.

117
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:23,184
Okay.

118
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,750
- Jesus, man!
- Honey.

119
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,451
Just get the heck
out of here, man.

120
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,220
- What the fuck?
- He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

121
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:02,455
Oh, he's painting
the house now?

122
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:03,523
Well, yeah.

123
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:06,125
Stop fixing my house!

124
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,228
I'm almost done,
just hold on.

125
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,497
Why don't you just
paint the neighbors' houses?

126
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:12,132
Theirs are worse
than ours.

127
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,867
Just hold on one second.

128
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,167
I mean,
we appreciate it,

129
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,036
in some way, but, yeah...

130
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,104
It's weird, man!

131
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:20,306
I'm almost done.

132
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,274
Look, we will
call the cops, man.

133
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:23,777
And I mean it this time.

134
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,979
No, we're not
gonna call the cops.

135
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,314
We're not calling the cops,
just stop coming back.

136
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:31,117
I'm almost done, hold on,
please, hold on.

137
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:34,019
Ugh! Just get off
my fucking birdie bath.

138
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,821
No, just...

139
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:37,023
Get outta here, man.

140
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:38,827
- Those were $3.
- Fine.

141
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,027
I'll finish it next time.

142
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:42,461
- God!
- Next time?

143
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:43,930
Oh, just get...

144
00:09:43,932 --> 00:09:45,398
Get the heck off
my birdie bath!

145
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,202
Just water the plants
in the back or I will.

146
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,502
Oh!

147
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,937
Bro!
You were supposed to be the lookout!

148
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,273
Mmm-hmm.

149
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,840
You were the one
that was so worried.

150
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:56,212
I got distracted.

151
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:59,278
Bro!

152
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,480
What if OG
is right though?

153
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:04,050
You really gotta stop
eating the fish out there.

154
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:05,585
I think it's fine.

155
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:07,954
All fish has mercury.

156
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:12,992
I know, but I saw a
seagull with a dick, bro.

157
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:15,527
Well, so I guess
it's a male.

158
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:18,433
No, like, bro,
like a human dick.

159
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:23,869
Oh, nasty-ass
tumbleweave. Pussy.

160
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,271
- Wild, bro.
- Wassup, nigga?

161
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:26,572
- Ain't tryin' do nothin'.
- Scuff my shoes up, huh?

162
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,207
I ain't tryin'
do that bullshit...

163
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,508
Stop playin' before I slap
the shit out your face.

164
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,009
Man, shut your ass up, nigga.

165
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,177
All right,
I ain't finna chase you,

166
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:33,546

167
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:36,014
You lucky I don't beat
your ass out here, bro.

168
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:37,483
Kofi!

169
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,152
- What's good, brother?
- What's up with y'all?

170
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:41,019
Hey, you know I seen
Moms last night, right?

171
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:42,287
She was looking
like she was

172
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,356
missing a little bit
on the top.

173
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:46,960
I mean we shower in the same
water, Jim.

174
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,804
So niggas takin' showers
together now?

175
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,440
Probably was.

176
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:01,109
That's fruity.

177
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,244
I was trying to tell
him not to eat the fish,

178
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:06,979
because the water
is toxic.

179
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,413
Well, duh.

180
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,516
That's 'cause they built
the atomic bomb

181
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:11,887
right there, nigga.

182
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:26,034
I don't think
that's true.

183
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,234
What'd he say?

184
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:29,502
- Damn.
- First thing, that's true.

185
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:30,936
Bro, them shoes
ain't true,

186
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:32,272
I know your
Jesus-lookin' ass

187
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,940

bro.

188
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,642
- Them things is phony.
- They're definitely phony.

189
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:37,243
What about
cuz, man?

190
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:38,945
You was supposed to
call me last night.

191
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:40,479
- What happened with...
- Oh, yeah, dude is a cat.

192
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:41,580
You see his hair,
he might be a cheetah.

193
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:48,988
<i>Can I help you?</i>

194
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,058
<i>I'd like to see
the man in charge.</i>

195
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:52,024
<i>In here.</i>

196
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:53,558
He's walking him
into the Chief's office.

197
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,363
Oh, dear.

198
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:59,666
<i>I want to report
a murder.</i>

199
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:01,537
- <i>Sit down.</i>
- Now, who's that?

200
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:04,336
Edgar O'Ryan.

201
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:05,939
<i>Where was
this murder committed?</i>

202
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,606
- Edmund O'Brien.
- <i>San Francisco.</i>

203
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:10,109
Oh. Oh, him,
yeah, yeah.

204
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,279
<i>Who was murdered?</i>

205
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:14,917
<i>I was.</i>

206
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:21,287
What?

207
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:23,623
- How?
- Just watch it.

208
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,628
<i>I don't have
very much time.</i>

209
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,162
Hey, hand me
my beer, son.

210
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,665
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

211
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,231
Yeah, okay.

212
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,734
O'Brien is smoking
a cigarette

213
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:39,104
- in his office.
- Okay, yeah.

214
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:42,477
- Secretary's perched.
- She pretty?

215
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:45,378
Mmm...

216
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,283
- Yeah?
- I'd say... I'd say she is.

217
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:51,651
You dog.

218
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,557
Hey, Mont!

219
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:59,091
- Montgomery!
- Mmm?

220
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:01,293
How do I get their old
croissant-throwing asses

221
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:02,363
out of the house?

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,001
What if I peed
on their table?

223
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:12,341
Like, what if I climbed up
the birdie bath,

224
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:14,574
broke in and just peed

225
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,378
all over that stupid
little yellow table?

226
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:20,348
Wouldn't that
ruin the floors?

227
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,486
Yeah, I guess
you got a point there.

228
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:27,522
Oh.

229
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:41,367
You think they'd let me
live there as, like,

230
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:43,672
a caretaker
for the house?

231
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:49,108
No.

232
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,448
That's fucked up.

233
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,615
I mean, I take pretty
good care of the house,

234
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:58,417
I think so at least.

235
00:13:58,419 --> 00:13:59,755
Yeah, you do.

236
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,258
We like having
you here, Jim.

237
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,094
I know, bro.

238
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:09,162
But...

239
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:11,433
You know
there's no place like home.

240
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,303
Yeah.

241
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,205

Yeah.

All right?

259
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,776
Small guy.

260
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:05,147
He's perfect.

261
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:11,687
Hey, you get any writing
done this morning?

262
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:14,222
Um...

263
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,359
Writing is rewriting.

264
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:21,663
It's all part
of the process.

265
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:25,500
Yeah, you got it, though.

266
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,270
Hmm... Yeah, man.

267
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,726
What the f...

268
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:00,800
Y'all been here 12 years,

269
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,837
still can't take care
of this house.

270
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:15,517
Hey, Paul.

271
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:17,785
Hey!

272
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:20,956
I got you.

273
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:25,625
- Hi.
- Eat your banana.

274
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,759
- Fuck you.
- Hey.

275
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:30,763
You're a nice man.

276
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,898
You're a nice woman.

277
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,736
But I don't know you.

278
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:42,574
Well, yeah.

279
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:44,679
You know me
pretty well, actually.

280
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:49,314
But you aren't
my husband.

281
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:52,318
You're a
little too young for me.

282
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:57,659
I am young.

283
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:00,928
I'm always young.

284
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,330
You're a nice man.

285
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,535
Oh, thank you.

286
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:09,834
You're a nice woman.

287
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:13,039
You old marshmallow,
cream puff ass,

288
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,074
candied yam-ass nigga,
cream puff-ass nigga.

289
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,476
Shut up, bitch, bro.

290
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:20,045
- You bitch.
- Hold this shit.

291
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:21,981
I should snatch
your one-ass dread,

292
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:24,617
lookin' like
a fuckin' Rastafarian sperm.

293
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:30,455
You got me fucked up.

294
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,823
- We got you fucked up!
- We did!

295
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,391
That's all you gotta say?

296
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:34,726
Man, what I'm supposed
to do, take off?

297
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:36,395
I don't care
about none of that shit.

298
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:37,929
I know, I just ain't
got nothin' else to say.

299
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:39,398
Man, I put that
on a fact,

300
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
that this nigga's
a bitch, man.

301
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:41,469
- Is that sure, man.
- Man, fuck this nigga.

302
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,746
'Sup, nigga?

303
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:58,520
'Sup, nigga?

304
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,693
How are you, nigga?

305
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,495
I hope she's not home.

306
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:44,929
That garden...

307
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:47,399
We have so much to do.

308
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,734
We have to rake it.

309
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,002
We have to weed it.

310
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:51,340
- We have to...
- Jim.

311
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:55,140
Isn't that the car
you used to live in?

312
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:56,841
Oh, God.

313
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:59,145
Jimmie!

314
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:01,850
What up,
filth-smellin' motherfucker?

315
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,684
Do you need a ride?

316
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:13,993
Jimmie!

317
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:15,994
What's happenin', baby?

318
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:18,997
Get your young,
old-looking ass in the car.

319
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,733
Daddy face.

320
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:21,966
Jimmie!

321
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:24,570
Oh, my God,
where is this bus?

322
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:27,705
Man, if you don't get your up the
father from <i>Good Times</i> shirt-wearing ass

323
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:28,709
in this car...

324
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,744
You really gonna ride
in the bus with a shovel?

325
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:35,947
Get your farming ass
in this car.

326
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:38,484
Jimmie the farmer
with your bitch ass.

327
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:46,962
Come on, laugh a little bit,
Jimmie, shit.

328
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,594
Still the same.

329
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:52,566
Yep, I like what you
and your dad did with it.

330
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:55,834
So much
you drove off with it?

331
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:57,936
No, I borrowed it, I
didn't, just, come on...

332
00:20:57,938 --> 00:21:01,506
I drove off with it...
I borrowed it, shit.

333
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:03,908
Matter of fact,
I seen your dad the other day.

334
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,844
He was good and lonely.

335
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:07,181
By hisself.

336
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,081
Okay.

337
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,952
I told him you need to
get you a cat or a dog,

338
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:14,823
or woman or something,
nigga, damn.

339
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,490
He's home alone...

340
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:20,091
Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

341
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:22,528
He's alone with no home.

342
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,933
Well, you live in a car
by yourself.

343
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:30,836
Yeah, but I...
But I'm not alone.

344
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:32,541
People like me.

345
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:34,609
I'm liked.

346
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:37,546
Lonely ass nigga.

347
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,817
When the last time you
hung out with your daddy?

348
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,222
Couple weeks ago,
I dunno.

349
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:53,028
Couple weeks ago?
The nigga needs you today.

350
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:55,593
Shit.

351
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:58,129
That's what... That's what
people have kids for,

352
00:21:58,131 --> 00:22:00,599
so they can have
some companionship!

353
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:02,667
Somebody to hang out with.

354
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,637
That's why
I ain't had no kids.

355
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:06,839
'Cause I don't wanna
be bothered.

356
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:08,773
Your daddy don't want
this fuckin' car, man.

357
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:10,309
- Hey.
- Hmm?

358
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,711
Wasn't that
the Savoy House?

359
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:14,746
Oh, sure was.

360
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:18,553
It was 100 motherfuckers
in there, rent-controlled.

361
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:22,189
They thought
they owned that shit.

362
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,091
The landlord burned all
of the people outta there.

363
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:28,927
'Cause see, Jimmie,

364
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:30,798
you never really
own shit.

365
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:34,198
This car ain't mine.

366
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,072
But it never was yours.

367
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:46,147
You never own shit!

368
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:55,253
What the fuck?

369
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:09,767
Hey, what's goin' on, man?

370
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,171
<i>No se,</i> bro.

371
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:21,116
Uh, sir...

372
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,983
What's...
What's going on?

373
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,320
Oh, God.

374
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,023
She's moving.

375
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:31,790
Fighting like crazy
with her sister.

376
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:33,993
When someone
dies in the family,

377
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,994
that's what
white people do.

378
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:39,365
This is for her,
this is for him, this is mine.

379
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,065
Who's gonna
have the house?

380
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:43,101
So they lost the house?

381
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:45,140
Who's gonna
possess the house?

382
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:50,178
They're just fighting,
and fighting, and fighting.

383
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:03,357
What's gonna happen
to it now?

384
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:15,102
Why'd they have to move
out 'cause her mom died?

385
00:24:16,937 --> 00:24:18,238
I don't know.

386
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:21,439
They were tasteless,

387
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:23,975
but at least
they didn't fuck it up.

388
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:26,445
Well, that will be
$10, hun.

389
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,147
Since when?

390
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,015
Since that's the best deal
you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

391
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:33,851
I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie.
I said 16.

392
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:35,856
How I'm gonna
eat 60 Twix?

393
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:38,322
I don't know your life.

394
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:40,693
You act like you in
Costco or something like that.

395
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:42,226
You ain't Costco.

396
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:44,263
Hey, you can go
to Costco if you need to.

397
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,264
- You Rosco.
- Go right now.

398
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,899
Sixteen, first time you had a
check, when I was 16.

399
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:50,270
<i>Jim. Jim.</i>

400
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,375
Jim.

401
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:56,340
Jim?

402
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:57,879
So, gentlemen.

403
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:01,683
What can I do for you?

404
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,050
Yeah, we're curious
about a house

405
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:07,753
on Golden Gate
near Fillmore.

406
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:10,321
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's 959.

407
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:13,358
It's the gray,
it's got the gold trim.

408
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,461
- Uh...
- Yup, yup.

409
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:18,129
Yup, with the, um...

410
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:19,333
The witch hat.

411
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:22,201
Yeah, exactly.

412
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:23,936
Yeah!

413
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:25,270
I know exactly
what you're talking about,

414
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:27,106
- that place is very special.
- Hmm.

415
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,506
I used to drive
past that house

416
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,141
on the way
to school every day.

417
00:25:30,143 --> 00:25:32,010
What school
did you go to?

418
00:25:32,012 --> 00:25:33,811
I went to St. Ignatius.

419
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:35,414
You from here, too?

420
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,448
Yeah, third generation,
I went to Reardon, actually.

421
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,184
- Really?
- Yeah,

422
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:40,886
we used to play y'all
in football all the time.

423
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:41,954
Fuck you,
you used to kill us in football.

424
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:43,054
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:44,089
I didn't wanna
say that, but...

426
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:46,457
That's awesome, right on.

427
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,994
But, so, it's for sale?
I didn't hear about that.

428
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:50,896
Well, I'm not sure.

429
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:52,865
It seems like the owner
and her sister

430
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:54,198
are fighting over it.

431
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,303
But I guess
her mom died.

432
00:25:57,537 --> 00:25:59,772
Ah, man.

433
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:02,273
I don't know, that sounds
like an estate thing.

434
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:04,746
That's a sucky situation.

435
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:07,245
But, I mean...

436
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:08,880
With a house like that,

437
00:26:08,882 --> 00:26:10,985
they could be fighting
over that for years.

438
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:13,154
While it just sits there.

439
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:16,187
It's a pity.

440
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:19,457
So it's really just...
Just empty?

441
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:20,958
It's fucked up, right?

442
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,528
So fucked up, like I...

443
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,996
Bothers me, there's all
these people in the street

444
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:26,365
and these big old houses

445
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,801
are just sitting there
collecting dust.

446
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:31,803
But shit,
what else can you say?

447
00:26:31,805 --> 00:26:35,075
The fucking injustice of it!

448
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,278
Yeah.

449
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:53,017
Mont! We here, baby!

450
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:19,511
Spoiling all the fun,

451
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:22,214
leveling most
of this neighborhood

452
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:24,616
in the name of Urban Renewal.

453
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:27,985
Sorry about your homes
and your funky shops.

454
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:30,022
You can set up
a shoeshine stand

455
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:32,456
in front of the parking lot
at Safeway.

456
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,959
But you distinguished
truth-seekers

457
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:38,163
want to know about the real
hep cats who hung out here,

458
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:40,532
in the "Harlem of the West,"

459
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:44,403
where a few of these homes
did survive.

460
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:46,271
Like this beauty here,

461
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:49,573
which was built
clear back in the 1800s.

462
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:51,310
Before the black thing,

463
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,245
this was all Japanese,

464
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:57,983
till FDR's stormtroopers
rounded them up into camps.

465
00:28:57,985 --> 00:29:00,985
This house was built
in the 1940s.

466
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:05,090
Say hi to our neighbor
here, everybody.

467
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:06,992
Hi.

468
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:10,661
That would actually be about
100 years late for this style.

469
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:13,365
We can see
from his gingerbread trim,

470
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:17,336
this was built
sometime in the 1850s.

471
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,638
Uh, 1946!

472
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,574
I'm gonna have to disagree
with you there, dude man.

473
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:28,045
No architect in the 1940s
was building in this style.

474
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:31,986
That's probably true,
but this wasn't built by an architect.

475
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:34,554
My grandfather built this.

476
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:40,157
He came here World War II,

477
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,964
he bought this lot
and he built this house.

478
00:29:44,163 --> 00:29:45,563
The stairs.

479
00:29:45,565 --> 00:29:47,398
These windows.

480
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,470
The columns. The archways.

481
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:52,239
The witch hat.

482
00:29:53,172 --> 00:29:54,508
The balustrades.

483
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:56,511
The fish scales.

484
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:59,511
This balcony.

485
00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:02,050
That wall to keep
y'all the fuck out.

486
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,953
All of it.

487
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:09,687
By Jimmie Fails I,
with his own two hands.

488
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:11,558
In 1946.

489
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,529
Wow.

490
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,132
That's pretty amazing.

491
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:20,000
Well...

492
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:23,068
Let's move on
to our next stop.

493
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,070
The closet Patty Hearst

494
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:28,372
willfully hid herself in,
before trotting on down...

495
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:31,011
What's good with that?
What's going on?

496
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:34,245
Feel like
the King of England.

497
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:36,048
King Jimmie. Wave.

498
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,385
Wave to the General.

499
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:41,253
- Hey, General.
- Yeah, but it's like a circle,

500
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:43,455
with your...
With your elbow.

501
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:45,223
Yeah, and then
cup the air.

502
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:46,425
That's kind of
the thing there.

503
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,096
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, that's good.

504
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:32,406
It's a beautiful house,
Jimmie.

505
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:37,745
More beautiful than
I could have imagined.

506
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:40,180
Yeah.

507
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:43,618
It's not quite
there yet.

508
00:31:57,197 --> 00:31:59,833
I mean, enough Dickens.

509
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:01,832
Charles Dickens.

510
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,601
Philistines, bro.

511
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:05,137
Proust!

512
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:06,905
Plath!

513
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:08,273
Hughes!

514
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:11,342
Jimmie! Langston Hughes!

515
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:12,679
They left him!

516
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,248
Bro!

517
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:19,553
Philistines!

518
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,631
Mont.

519
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:34,869
Mont.

520
00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:38,338
Wake up.

521
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,712
Got a plan.

522
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:10,267
It's crazy.

523
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:12,305
Last time I was here,
these weeds was taller than me.

524
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:16,574
She's expecting us?

525
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:17,911
Yes, sir.

526
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,657
- Auntie!
- Jimmie!

527
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:35,526
Yes!

528
00:33:35,528 --> 00:33:38,295
Oh! So good
to see you!

529
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:39,763
- You look good!
- Thank you.

530
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:41,499
- Hey!
- This is Mont.

531
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:44,569
Nice to meet you.
Oh.

532
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:46,437
Y'all not hot?
Like, you want...

533
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,938
- It's hot as hell out here.
- Take your jacket off.

534
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,974
Ain't nobody gonna
steal your jacket.

535
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:52,780
This is a nice neighborhood.

536
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:57,549
Man, he better not
break my damn board.

537
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:58,849
Shut up.

538
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,851
You should be
thanking him.

539
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:03,457
He's the one that helped
me pick out that board.

540
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:07,425
And besides...

541
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:09,296
Sometimes it's just

542
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:11,932
nice to watch.

543
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:14,735
Mmm.

544
00:34:17,436 --> 00:34:19,606
Ricky, do that trick
you used to do, baby.

545
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:23,977
Nice, baby.

546
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,445
Y'all hella cute.

547
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,316
Aw, thank you.

548
00:34:30,684 --> 00:34:32,316
So,

549
00:34:32,318 --> 00:34:34,287
how much of this stuff
do you still have?

550
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,553
Really?

551
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:38,890
How much
of this stuff do you have?

552
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:40,892
You just,
no segue or nothin'?

553
00:34:40,894 --> 00:34:42,727
You just came to see
the stuff, huh?

554
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:43,894
Auntie...

555
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:45,565
I got my first place.

556
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,802
Whoa.

557
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:50,804
Really?

558
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,671
In the city?

559
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,071
In the city.

560
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:55,874
Look at you!

561
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,709
Y'all must be doing pretty
well to afford a spot there.

562
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:00,514
Yeah, we got lucky.

563
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:04,851
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's super empty, though.

564
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:10,591
Your daddy didn't
send you here, right?

565
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:12,756
- No.
- You sure?

566
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:13,760
I swear to God.

567
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,495
'Cause I hope he's done

568
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:20,434
dragging you
into his schemes.

569
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,803
Auntie, this is for us.

570
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:29,043
Okay.

571
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:31,943
Okay.

572
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:36,113
I'm proud of you, Jayboe.

573
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:38,850
- Really am.
- Thank you.

574
00:35:38,852 --> 00:35:40,454
I miss that city.

575
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:44,455
Oh! Ooh!

576
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:46,557
You still look good
though, baby.

577
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,126
You still look good!

578
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:50,397
Mmm.

579
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:53,398
Oh, my goodness.

580
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,466
Mmm.

581
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,807
Damn, I knew you had some of
it, but is this everything?

582
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:06,945
Everything your dad
didn't smoke up.

583
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:09,580
Sorry, came out
a little harsh.

584
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:10,651
I'm fine.

585
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,394
You really got
all of this.

586
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:22,095
Yep!

587
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:25,666
Got as much as I could.

588
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:37,477
Open that.

589
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,113
That's amazing.

590
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:44,816
Yeah, I knew that,

591
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:46,517
out of everybody
in this family,

592
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,922
you would be the one that
come looking for this stuff.

593
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:51,592
So...

594
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:54,892
I can...

595
00:36:54,894 --> 00:36:56,063
Everything?

596
00:36:58,197 --> 00:36:59,898
It's yours.

597
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,066
- Thank you.
- Hell, yeah.

598
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:03,437
Ricky, get the truck!

599
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:07,842
You guys good back there?

600
00:37:32,064 --> 00:37:33,131
Bye.

601
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,535
Thank you.

602
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:38,169
So, Ricky never lived
in the house?

603
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:41,705
No, Wanda didn't meet him
until after we lost it.

604
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,588
- Hello, sir.
- Hey!

605
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,490
I'm Jimmie Fails, we haven't
had the chance to meet yet.

606
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:00,960
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

607
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:03,528
Welcome to the neighborhood.

608
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,129
Yeah, oh, yes...

609
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:06,664
Welcome.

610
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,233
Tim! Tim Ellory.

611
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:09,800
Sure, sure,
nice to meet you, man.

612
00:38:09,802 --> 00:38:11,602
It's a fast-moving market,

613
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:13,771
I don't even remember
a sign going up.

614
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:16,240
Oh, it didn't
need to, but...

615
00:38:16,242 --> 00:38:18,876
Look, Tim,
I want you to know

616
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:21,548
I'm going to be the best
damn neighbor you ever had.

617
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:24,182
Well...

618
00:38:24,184 --> 00:38:27,519
- All right, Jimmie, thank you.
- My pleasure.

619
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,954
Uh, well,
you'll have to pardon me,

620
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:32,090
we've got
lots to do, but...

621
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:34,628
- Of course, oh, yeah.
- Very nice to meet you, yeah.

622
00:38:42,535 --> 00:38:45,102
What the fuck
was that all about?

623
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:08,059
I wanna drink my coffee

624
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:10,597
and scratch my ass
while I read the paper.

625
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:14,067
You don't read
the paper, Jimmie.

626
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:18,838
'Cause I never had
a home to read it in.

627
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:22,709
Shit.

628
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:25,945
We could throw parties.

629
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:32,085
You could put on
one of your plays.

630
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:36,287
We could yell.

631
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,729
- The neighbors, Jimmie.
- Oh, the neighbors?

632
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:47,535
- Hmm.
- I got neighbors now.

633
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:52,573
Attaboy.

634
00:40:57,436 --> 00:41:01,074
This nigga is a bitch.

635
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:47,184
I'm a soft nigga.
Run the fake, nigga!

636
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:51,189
On everything, bro.

637
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:52,923
Man, this kid
was a straight sucker.

638
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:54,459
You lyin', bro,

639
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:56,894
on everything, bro,
straight sucker, bro.

640
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:58,262
Tell him what happened.
I swear to God.

641
00:41:58,264 --> 00:41:59,196
Man, last night,
a white van pulled up.

642
00:41:59,198 --> 00:42:00,965
I swear to God, bro.

643
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,332
This nigga Kofi ran
like a straight bitch!

644
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:03,867
- He not lyin'!
- He gonna get us killed!

645
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,135
You niggas sayin' I ran?
I didn't run, nigga!

646
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:06,903
Man, fuck what you niggas
talkin' about.

647
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:08,472
Shut the fuck up, bro,
he's a straight sucker, bro.

648
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:10,073
Hey, hey, man, he got us
looking like bitches, bro.

649
00:42:10,075 --> 00:42:11,175
If I've gotta
get on this thing,

650
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:12,209
I'm gonna be questioning you!

651
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:13,811
You supposed to be my cousin.

652
00:42:13,813 --> 00:42:15,146
I'mma bet you supposed
to not run, nigga,

653
00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:16,747
and that's what
you supposed to do.

654
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:19,249
All right, all right,
all right, all right, bro.

655
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:20,417
All right, everybody
shut up, bro.

656
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:21,785
All right,
everybody shut up, bro.

657
00:42:21,787 --> 00:42:23,454
Kofi, what happened, bro?

658
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:24,457
Tell him.

659
00:42:25,457 --> 00:42:26,890
Uh...

660
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:28,291
Why?

661
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:31,095
- Tell him!
- Did you run, nigga?

662
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:32,497
Nah, I didn't
run, nigga.

663
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:34,030
I told you!

664
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:36,267
- Lyin', lyin'.
- Man, fuck you, nigga.

665
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:37,769
Get on him!

666
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:38,939
Wow.

667
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:43,407
- Hit me, bro.
- Man, what?

668
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:44,410
Hit me, bro.

669
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:48,879
Hit me, bro.

670
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:50,180
And for what,
you supposed to be my folks.

671
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:51,751
Hey, Kofi,

672
00:42:52,485 --> 00:42:55,186
Yeah! Come on, bro!

673
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:57,988
Yeah! Let's go! Let's go!
Get on him!

674
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,990
Hit me, bro! Hit me, bro!

675
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:01,091
This nigga's a bitch!

676
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:03,126
Hit me, man! Come on!

677
00:43:03,128 --> 00:43:04,931
Guys! Guys!

678
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:07,834
Great, it's great.

679
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:11,169
Very good, very good.

680
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,174
Cut! Very good, very good.

681
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,175
Good, good, excellent.

682
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,144
Good. Hey, great news

683
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:22,579
is you're all doing
marvelous work.

684
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:24,182
- What?
- Congratulations,

685
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,519
it's not easy.

686
00:43:30,856 --> 00:43:32,823
I believe you.

687
00:43:32,825 --> 00:43:35,059
But I know
it can be deeper.

688
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:37,030
- Fuck you talkin' about?
- Hey.

689
00:43:38,865 --> 00:43:40,997
Remember Stanislavski.

690
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:42,200
Fuck are you doin', man?

691
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,035
Grotowski or Slavski...

692
00:43:44,037 --> 00:43:45,570
Chekhov, bruh.

693
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:47,508
- These are the greats.
- I'm confused, bro.

694
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:00,419
You're okay there.

695
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:03,356
You're okay there.

696
00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:07,461
Bro, you're not
a director, bro.

697
00:44:11,264 --> 00:44:12,896
Man, take your
weird ass outta here.

698
00:44:12,898 --> 00:44:14,932
Keep building it.

699
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:16,100
Nigga, I don't like when that
nigga come around here, bro.

700
00:44:16,102 --> 00:44:17,468
Bro,
this nigga's a bitch.

701
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,269
Say the word,
I get on this nigga, bro!

702
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:25,412
Here we go.

703
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,535
Watch this for me
real quick, bro.

704
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:54,842
I know.

705
00:45:38,617 --> 00:45:41,053
I seen your cousin, Al,
the other day.

706
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:46,222
Aight, "Hey, Uncle James!"

707
00:45:46,224 --> 00:45:48,091
I look like,
"Man, I don't know you,

708
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:51,729
"down there struttin' around,
like a Frisco fruit cup."

709
00:45:51,731 --> 00:45:55,669
I know his daddy mad as hell.

710
00:45:57,669 --> 00:45:58,938
You still skateboarding?

711
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,108
Nah.

712
00:46:05,177 --> 00:46:06,313
Hmm.

713
00:46:08,581 --> 00:46:09,916
What?

714
00:46:12,251 --> 00:46:13,954
Come here,
help me cut these out.

715
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:21,624
And make sure the color bleeds
all the way through,

716
00:46:21,626 --> 00:46:23,727
no white edges, aight?

717
00:46:23,729 --> 00:46:25,698
Yes, sir. Same as always.

718
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:27,333
Yeah.

719
00:46:28,534 --> 00:46:31,568
Same as always.

720
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,372
Hey, you remember that, uh,
warehouse we squatted at?

721
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,273
After we lived
in the El Dorado?

722
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:39,443
We lost that ' cause we
didn't pay taxes, right?

723
00:46:39,445 --> 00:46:40,778
Hell, nah.

724
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,082
I paid our fair share
of tax on that.

725
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,285
But who cares,
old drafty-ass roach nest.

726
00:46:48,287 --> 00:46:50,220
Shit, it was that,

727
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:52,491
or sleeping on the street
with your little ass.

728
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:55,228
Well, I appreciate it, Dad.

729
00:46:55,695 --> 00:46:57,030
Mmm-hmm.

730
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:00,734
So, say I'm at
a place now

731
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:03,403
and the owners left it,

732
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:05,702
I'm gonna pay taxes on it...

733
00:47:05,704 --> 00:47:08,805
And you put gas
and electric in your name?

734
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:12,075
Right, I'm gonna do that next,
you know I know.

735
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:14,680
Okay, doin' it
like your old man.

736
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:18,048
That's good.

737
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:21,117
And nobody's
come to check on it?

738
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,588
Nope. It's empty.

739
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,823
Good.

740
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:27,361
That buys you time.

741
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:30,429
And they been gone
three years?

742
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,664
Nah, just recently.

743
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:36,066
Wait, what?

744
00:47:36,068 --> 00:47:38,301
You were workin' on it
while they were still in it?

745
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:39,506
Yeah.

746
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:43,744
Where is this house?

747
00:47:46,345 --> 00:47:47,747
It's the house in Fillmore.

748
00:47:57,856 --> 00:47:59,125
Wow.

749
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:06,566
Our old house.

750
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,272
What the fuck you mean,
our old house?

751
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:17,443
Have you seen that house?

752
00:48:19,878 --> 00:48:21,312
Well, yeah, I mean,

753
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:23,146
I be over there all the time.

754
00:48:23,148 --> 00:48:24,682
Then you know
that's not your old house

755
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:27,354
and that's not
your black-ass neighborhood.

756
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:34,260
Little disrespectful
lyin' ass.

757
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:41,101
- What are you talking about?
- Nigga, I know you skateboard!

758
00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:46,604
Yeah.

759
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:48,475
Yeah, I see all that shit
out there.

760
00:48:49,275 --> 00:48:51,541
Everybody's little path.

761
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:54,547
I'm like 30 steps
ahead of y'all.

762
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:04,754
Go on.

763
00:49:04,756 --> 00:49:06,823
Get!

764
00:49:06,825 --> 00:49:09,195
You know we don't talk
about that house no more.

765
00:49:11,597 --> 00:49:13,332
Put the shit down
and go!

766
00:49:56,876 --> 00:49:58,644
Hey, you been
waiting here long?

767
00:49:59,778 --> 00:50:01,247
Hella long, bro.

768
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:03,816
I might just skate.

769
00:50:05,885 --> 00:50:07,454
Well, that"s nice.

770
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,702
This guy fucks.

771
00:50:24,704 --> 00:50:29,240
Hey, Sundeep.
Sundeep, bro, this guy fucks.

772
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:30,841
This guy fucks!

773
00:50:30,843 --> 00:50:32,309
This guy fucks!

774
00:50:32,311 --> 00:50:35,312
This guy fucks!
This guy fucks!

775
00:50:35,314 --> 00:50:38,249
This guy fucks!
This guy fucks!

776
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:40,651
This guy fucks!
This guy fucks!

777
00:50:48,593 --> 00:50:50,896
Oh, this city.

778
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:54,367
I already know, bro.

779
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:36,976
Fuck!

780
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:39,878
Are you okay?

781
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:44,351
Yeah.

782
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:50,423
Yeah.

783
00:51:56,628 --> 00:51:57,796
What is all this?

784
00:51:59,597 --> 00:52:00,666
Wow.

785
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:03,033
A little room
I used to come in

786
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:04,938
when my dad
was doing his thing.

787
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,575
It's cool, right?

788
00:52:10,508 --> 00:52:11,777
Yeah, man.

789
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:15,548
Did you see him today?

790
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:19,986
How'd it go?

791
00:52:21,653 --> 00:52:23,523
He said this was
a bad idea.

792
00:52:27,026 --> 00:52:28,791
Thought you said
he was an idiot.

793
00:52:28,793 --> 00:52:31,664
Nah, he's just mad
'cause he lost the house.

794
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:36,535
But what if
we shouldn't be here?

795
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:39,872
Who should be here more?

796
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:42,542
Hmm?

797
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:45,512
Some millionaire?

798
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:51,317
They'd want it
'cause it looks nice.

799
00:52:52,684 --> 00:52:54,787
You're the reason
it looks nice, Jim.

800
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:00,791
I don't know.

801
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:05,631
What the fuck?

802
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:08,768
I invited somebody.

803
00:53:18,943 --> 00:53:20,676
What's good, nigga?

804
00:53:20,678 --> 00:53:22,349
Glad you could make it.

805
00:53:23,081 --> 00:53:24,650
What's goin' on?

806
00:53:30,088 --> 00:53:31,957
Be back in a sec,
pardon me.

807
00:53:32,892 --> 00:53:34,727
Y'all got an organ?

808
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:46,138
Columns and shit.

809
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:08,758
It's just y'all here?

810
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,162
Yeah.

811
00:54:12,131 --> 00:54:13,967
It just makes noises.

812
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:17,700
Oh, okay.

813
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:19,001
It's nice to see you
in that chair,

814
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:21,204
I didn't know
you'd pick that one.

815
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:23,207
Thanks a lot, bro.

816
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:24,944
Kinda awkward,

817
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:27,079
but this place is cool.

818
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,546
Yeah.

819
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:31,615
Jimmie's been doing a lot
to fix it up.

820
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:33,584
How'd y'all get this?

821
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:34,721
It's Jimmie's.

822
00:54:35,854 --> 00:54:37,720
His grandpa built it.

823
00:54:37,722 --> 00:54:40,524
He was the first black man
in San Francisco.

824
00:54:40,526 --> 00:54:41,961
That's what
they call him anyways.

825
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,863
Oh, shit.

826
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:48,468
- This that house?
- Hmm.

827
00:54:49,834 --> 00:54:53,570
Hey, Jimmie used to talk
about this spot all the time.

828
00:54:53,572 --> 00:54:55,175
But you know how niggas
be in the group home.

829
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:58,110
Overexaggerating and shit.

830
00:54:59,811 --> 00:55:01,213
Trying to be all special.

831
00:55:03,948 --> 00:55:05,952
You weren't lying about
this one, though, huh, Jimmie?

832
00:55:06,918 --> 00:55:08,787
You were in a group home?

833
00:55:11,023 --> 00:55:12,559
Yeah.

834
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:15,128
For like a year.

835
00:55:16,061 --> 00:55:17,664
Yep.

836
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:24,503
You guys wanna go
for a schvitz?

837
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,178
A what?

838
00:55:40,785 --> 00:55:42,722
Wait, your grandfather
made this too?

839
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:47,593
Nah. Nah,
these white people did.

840
00:55:49,028 --> 00:55:50,129
Uh-huh.

841
00:55:51,195 --> 00:55:53,829
Well, how you know he was
the first one, though?

842
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:55,698
Nigga be lyin'.

843
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,834
Bro,
he came over here from New Orleans.

844
00:55:58,836 --> 00:56:01,104
There was
hella Japanese people, bro.

845
00:56:01,106 --> 00:56:04,341
And then they got thrown
into little war camps

846
00:56:04,343 --> 00:56:06,709
and he wasn't tryin' to move
into nobody else's shit,

847
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:08,611
so he built this, bro.

848
00:56:08,613 --> 00:56:10,782
This is great.

849
00:56:13,918 --> 00:56:15,287
You still skate, bro?

850
00:56:17,189 --> 00:56:18,955
Nah.

851
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:20,890
No, I don't
skate no more.

852
00:56:20,892 --> 00:56:23,994
Oh, shit, I mean,
you used to be hella raw.

853
00:56:23,996 --> 00:56:25,298
Yeah.

854
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:29,265
I don't know, I'm, uh...

855
00:56:29,267 --> 00:56:31,167
Hey, you remember Gunna?

856
00:56:31,169 --> 00:56:33,836
Remember when he got caught
stealing from the candy lady?

857
00:56:37,776 --> 00:56:39,742
Yeah, he's an ugly-ass
crier, really.

858
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:41,079
Oh, man.

859
00:56:42,146 --> 00:56:44,381
Hurt as fuck!

860
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:46,350
Hey, remember,
uh, Ms. Homer,

861
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:48,117
the one that ran
the group home?

862
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,019
- Oh yeah!
- And she cut that nigga hair,

863
00:56:50,021 --> 00:56:51,854
had his line crooked!

864
00:56:51,856 --> 00:56:53,724
Hella much!

865
00:56:53,726 --> 00:56:55,725
He goin', "Damn, that white
lady couldn't cut no hair!"

866
00:56:57,662 --> 00:57:00,162
Had that nigga's shit
lookin' like Lombard Street.

867
00:57:02,401 --> 00:57:04,901
That nigga said Lomb...

868
00:57:04,903 --> 00:57:08,305
Aw, man, you niggas gonna
make me piss on myself.

869
00:57:08,307 --> 00:57:10,774
Oh, shit, y'all got
a bathroom up in here, man?

870
00:57:10,776 --> 00:57:12,142
In this big-ass house?

871
00:57:12,144 --> 00:57:13,744
It's down the hall.

872
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:15,778
It's the room with the
little claw-foot tub.

873
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,151
Aight, this cool as shit,
big-ass house.

874
00:57:19,852 --> 00:57:21,054
Mans...

875
00:57:22,253 --> 00:57:24,655
I wish I had
a grandpa like you.

876
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:27,057
Need me
some shit like this.

877
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,091
This shit is enjoyable.

878
00:57:29,093 --> 00:57:30,894
Right on, bro.

879
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:33,332
I'm proud of you niggas.
You too, Mont.

880
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:35,198
Crazy-ass.

881
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,901
Just living the life, man.

882
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:41,405
Y'all niggas just really

883
00:57:41,407 --> 00:57:44,343
Aw, shit, I"m gonna go use
this bathroom real quick.

884
00:57:46,077 --> 00:57:48,044
You a funny
motherfucker, Jimmie.

885
00:57:49,682 --> 00:57:51,150
"You a funny
motherfucker, Jimmie."

886
00:58:13,939 --> 00:58:15,241
You should, uh...

887
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:18,244
You should have
your own room, bro.

888
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:22,178
That's okay, Jim.

889
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,749
Nah, seriously, man.

890
00:58:25,117 --> 00:58:26,686
I been in
your space forever.

891
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:29,054
This place is yours, too.

892
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:34,894
Any room?

893
00:58:59,785 --> 00:59:01,120
How about this one?

894
00:59:04,155 --> 00:59:06,058
Are you sure
you want the dining room?

895
00:59:07,226 --> 00:59:08,695
Yeah.

896
00:59:11,028 --> 00:59:12,364
It's perfect.

897
00:59:19,104 --> 00:59:20,406
Dream big, bro.

898
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:22,775
It's yours.

899
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:34,050
Wow.

900
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:36,285
Yeah, we're gonna have to
figure something out.

901
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:38,220
I don't have
that much time.

902
00:59:38,222 --> 00:59:41,423
It's a complicated situation.

903
00:59:41,425 --> 00:59:42,892
No, the power's been on,

904
00:59:42,894 --> 00:59:44,362
I just need the bill
in my name.

905
00:59:47,566 --> 00:59:48,901
Uh-huh.

906
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:54,106
Okay, great.
Well, when will I get the first invoice?

907
00:59:56,941 --> 00:59:59,445
And you can't mail that
any sooner?

908
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:04,349
All right, yeah.

909
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:09,186
He's talking about
paying some bills.

910
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,419
'Cause I wouldn't say no

911
01:00:10,421 --> 01:00:12,358
if he offered to chip in
a little more.

912
01:00:13,325 --> 01:00:15,258
He already
pays half, Grandpa.

913
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,131
Well, he's been here
for a while, you know?

914
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:22,167
And he is not
exactly family.

915
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:25,869
I think he knows that.

916
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:27,269
Let's hope so.

917
01:00:27,271 --> 01:00:29,872
What's all this noise
up in here?

918
01:00:29,874 --> 01:00:31,077
I'm just
packing some stuff.

919
01:00:33,144 --> 01:00:34,447
It's for a project.

920
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:38,414
Since when?

921
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:42,151
I mean, we haven't even talked
about the characters yet.

922
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:43,419
You know how much
I like that.

923
01:00:43,421 --> 01:00:45,423
Yeah, well...
I'm still working on it.

924
01:00:46,892 --> 01:00:48,194
Don't quite have a plot yet.

925
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:52,896
Well, we can brainstorm
a little bit.

926
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:55,265
You know, that's where
I think we the best at.

927
01:00:55,267 --> 01:00:57,600
When we brainstorming.

928
01:00:57,602 --> 01:00:59,568
I think
I gotta brainstorm this one

929
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,973
by myself right now.

930
01:01:05,177 --> 01:01:06,912
But I'd love to talk
about it soon.

931
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:11,249
You 'bout
ready, bro?

932
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:14,854
Mmm-hmm.

933
01:01:18,189 --> 01:01:19,492
Well, um...

934
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,596
Whatever it is, uh...

935
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:27,867
I'm proud of you.

936
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,336
Wow, look at him.

937
01:01:34,338 --> 01:01:36,106
What type of shoes
are those?

938
01:01:36,108 --> 01:01:38,008
Yeah, you should start
rocking like that, bra-bra.

939
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,910
What the fuck is up
with your hat, Jimmie?

940
01:01:39,912 --> 01:01:42,178
You look like a human
cigarette, I can't handle it.

941
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,414
Jimmie,
is that a bowling ball?

942
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:46,416
It's the black
Alice and Wonderland.

943
01:01:46,418 --> 01:01:48,385
Hey, Monty, bro,
I heard you be whippin' out

944
01:01:48,387 --> 01:01:50,653
that little weenie
on all the girls.

945
01:01:52,189 --> 01:01:53,990
Bro, with that hair,
you look like a Simpson.

946
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:56,392
Nigga, shut up, bro,
your one-shirt-havin' ass.

947
01:01:56,394 --> 01:01:59,361
Jimmie, you wear the same
shirt every motherfuckin' day.

948
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:01,664
You look like a fiend,
Jimmie, come on!

949
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:04,200
Hey, just like your daddy!

950
01:02:04,202 --> 01:02:05,669
I remember!

951
01:02:05,671 --> 01:02:07,504
Your crackhead-ass daddy.

952
01:02:07,506 --> 01:02:10,407
And your
dumb-fiend-ass mom.

953
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:12,108
Family of fiends, dog.

954
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,410
I done sold him a rock
back in the day.

955
01:02:14,412 --> 01:02:15,678
Hey, what you
got up in there?

956
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,180
Some lace curtains

957
01:02:17,182 --> 01:02:18,515

01:02:21,552 --> 01:02:23,419
Hey, look!

961
01:02:23,421 --> 01:02:25,055
- they pulled up the other day.
- Uh-huh.

962
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:26,622
Niggas had

963
01:02:26,624 --> 01:02:28,490

in that house, bro.

964
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:30,193

01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:32,028

967
01:02:33,432 --> 01:02:35,664

968
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,166

Come on, man,

971
01:02:41,439 --> 01:02:44,573
I know who you is,
Jimmie, remember!

972
01:02:44,575 --> 01:02:45,675
Hey, you know

973
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:47,142
Y'all need to disappear

01:02:50,749 --> 01:02:52,015
Fuck outta here!

977
01:02:57,088 --> 01:02:59,557
Jimmie! Jimmie! Go home!

978
01:03:11,336 --> 01:03:12,972
You're really

979
01:03:17,476 --> 01:03:19,010
They just talk shit.

980
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,681
Well, you talked shit
when I met you.

981
01:03:27,552 --> 01:03:28,621
I did?

982
01:03:29,421 --> 01:03:30,656
You did.

983
01:03:32,157 --> 01:03:33,225
It's fine, though.

984
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:40,733
Why'd you hang out
with me, then?

985
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:45,070
You care about things.
I liked you.

986
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:51,043
You really don't give a fuck
what anybody says?

987
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:55,178
I shouldn't get to
appreciate them

988
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,149
'cause they're mean to me?

989
01:04:00,084 --> 01:04:01,987
That's silly.

990
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:44,196
Oh.

991
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:54,506
Phew.

992
01:05:58,736 --> 01:06:00,305
What are you doing here?

993
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:04,109
What are you
ever doing here?

994
01:06:06,343 --> 01:06:08,343
Uh...

995
01:06:08,345 --> 01:06:09,849
Didn't you
move out, though?

996
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:12,684
Yeah.

997
01:06:14,586 --> 01:06:16,822
They changed
the fuckin' locks on me.

998
01:06:20,592 --> 01:06:22,727
I'm sorry, that sucks.

999
01:06:25,497 --> 01:06:27,332
What do you want, man?

1000
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:32,170
How long you gonna be here?

1001
01:06:32,871 --> 01:06:34,671
I don't know yet.

1002
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:35,841
I'm just tryin' to...

1003
01:06:37,943 --> 01:06:39,410
Let go.

1004
01:06:40,778 --> 01:06:42,979
Okay, well...

1005
01:06:42,981 --> 01:06:45,251
I guess we'll just
come back tomorrow then.

1006
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:48,450
Great.

1007
01:06:48,452 --> 01:06:50,456
That's nice.

1008
01:06:52,724 --> 01:06:55,524
Come on, Jim,
we'll go to my house.

1009
01:06:55,526 --> 01:06:58,463
In this crazy fuckin'
city, you're still here.

1010
01:07:09,506 --> 01:07:13,343
Man, those damn kids dropping
bubble gum all over the place,

1011
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:14,843
it'll get all over
your seat, man.

1012
01:07:14,845 --> 01:07:16,412
You know what I'm sayin'?

1013
01:07:18,349 --> 01:07:19,884
Think she'll stay there
all night?

1014
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:24,320
Watch, we'll come back

1015
01:07:24,322 --> 01:07:26,191
and she'll be painting
the windowsill.

1016
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,501
Yes, baby.
Yes, I will be there.

1017
01:07:39,503 --> 01:07:40,637
I've been clean
for three years,

1018
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,305
I know where
those meetings are.

1019
01:07:42,307 --> 01:07:43,573
All right, you got it.

1020
01:07:43,575 --> 01:07:44,777
I'll be there
15 minutes early.

1021
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,278
Yes. Yes, I told...

1022
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:50,582
Jayboe?

1023
01:07:53,751 --> 01:07:54,887
Jayboe.

1024
01:07:57,322 --> 01:07:58,524
Uh...

1031
01:08:17,008 --> 01:08:19,441
I thought you and Ron
were in LA.

1032
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:21,580
Oh, no, we been back

1033
01:08:23,814 --> 01:08:25,347

01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,761
Why? Why?

What happened?

1070
01:09:46,164 --> 01:09:47,499
Why?

1071
01:10:24,669 --> 01:10:26,071

1072
01:10:33,143 --> 01:10:34,545

01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:46,558
They shot him.

1075
01:10:48,226 --> 01:10:49,961
Who? Who shot him?

1076
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:56,632
Who?

1077
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:58,003
Bay niggas.

1078
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,406
For what?

1079
01:11:02,973 --> 01:11:04,806
For what?

1080
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:09,180
He was talking shit
to the wrong niggas.

1081
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,816
Tried to bluff
some niggas out.

1082
01:11:13,116 --> 01:11:14,717
Tried to bluff them out?

1083
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,022
Man, what's with
all the questions, bro?

1084
01:11:19,624 --> 01:11:20,925
I just don't get it.

Push up on this nigga, bro.

1096
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:44,515
You finna
let him say that?

1097
01:12:18,081 --> 01:12:20,184
<i>That poor
boy and his friends.</i>

1098
01:12:24,656 --> 01:12:26,758
I'm sorry,
Jimmie.

1099
01:12:29,661 --> 01:12:32,998
I hope I never made you feel
like you weren't welcome here.

1100
01:12:35,332 --> 01:12:38,202
No, I... I never felt like that.

1101
01:12:40,338 --> 01:12:43,942
'Cause I don't care
where you been.

1102
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,112
You don't have
to tell me.

1103
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,983
It's just, you two

1104
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:54,253
stick together.

1105
01:13:09,267 --> 01:13:11,670
You know, I was writing
a play about him.

1106
01:13:18,643 --> 01:13:20,045
You don't have to stop now.

1107
01:13:25,383 --> 01:13:27,318
"You a funny
motherfucker, Jimmie."

1108
01:13:37,961 --> 01:13:40,098
I know
it sounds weird, but...

1109
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:43,335
I kinda feel like
that could've been me.

1110
01:13:45,268 --> 01:13:47,004
If not for the house.

1111
01:14:02,053 --> 01:14:03,854
Man, I wanna go home.

1112
01:14:23,907 --> 01:14:27,043
<i>Filthy, fishy salt water.</i>

1113
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:30,413
<i>Water been funkier
than the Devil's mouth</i>

1114
01:14:30,415 --> 01:14:32,181
<i>for 50 years.</i>

1115
01:14:32,183 --> 01:14:34,252
<i>Now they wanna clean it up.</i>

1116
01:14:35,753 --> 01:14:37,389
<i>They've got plans for us.</i>

1117
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:43,092
<i>We was made
to be put through Hell.</i>

1118
01:14:43,094 --> 01:14:46,298
Purified... We was made
to be put through Hell.

1119
01:14:48,165 --> 01:14:50,168
Be purified.

1120
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:03,948
Fuck!

1121
01:15:05,082 --> 01:15:06,351
Oh, God.

1122
01:15:09,353 --> 01:15:10,422
Fuck!

1123
01:15:22,066 --> 01:15:23,702
How did she toss
all of our shit?

1124
01:15:33,911 --> 01:15:35,347
I don't think it was her.

1125
01:15:45,223 --> 01:15:46,323
Fuckin' traitor.

1126
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:00,738
Okay.

1127
01:16:09,412 --> 01:16:11,279
Can you stay here
and watch the shit?

1128
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:12,883
Yeah, where you going?

1129
01:16:15,286 --> 01:16:16,988
- Where you going?
- I'll be back.

1130
01:16:17,487 --> 01:16:18,889
I'll be back.

1131
01:16:21,424 --> 01:16:22,427
Jimmie!

1132
01:16:27,932 --> 01:16:30,268
Sorry, uh,
how can I help you today?

1133
01:16:33,237 --> 01:16:34,936
Uh...

1134
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:38,477
- I want to buy a house.
- A house?

1135
01:16:39,977 --> 01:16:41,276
That's exciting.

1136
01:16:41,278 --> 01:16:42,781
Uh, are you working
with an agent?

1137
01:16:43,981 --> 01:16:45,751
No. Do I need to?

1138
01:16:46,284 --> 01:16:48,050
No.

1139
01:16:48,052 --> 01:16:49,851
Not necessarily. Um...

1140
01:16:49,853 --> 01:16:51,419
Do you have a price range
in mind?

1141
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:53,023
I have a house in mind.

1142
01:16:53,491 --> 01:16:55,291
Oh.

1143
01:16:55,293 --> 01:16:57,493
Um...

1144
01:16:57,495 --> 01:16:59,861
It's on the market,
I assume?

1145
01:16:59,863 --> 01:17:01,232
How much
are they asking?

1146
01:17:02,232 --> 01:17:04,533
At least $4 million.

1147
01:17:04,535 --> 01:17:08,072
Uh... And how much are you
willing to put down?

1148
01:17:09,607 --> 01:17:12,507
How much is usual?

1149
01:17:12,509 --> 01:17:15,914
Well, typically,
we'd be looking to secure at least 20%.

1150
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:25,620
I wouldn't have that.

1151
01:17:29,293 --> 01:17:31,025
That's understandable.

1152
01:17:31,027 --> 01:17:33,294
It's going to be hard
to land a place like that.

1153
01:17:33,296 --> 01:17:35,497
But suppose
I ask instead, uh...

1154
01:17:35,499 --> 01:17:38,068
No, no, look.

1155
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:40,104
I get it.

1156
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:43,004
I'm young.

1157
01:17:43,006 --> 01:17:44,409
Uh, I'm black.

1158
01:17:45,242 --> 01:17:46,378
I'm not rich.

1159
01:17:47,545 --> 01:17:49,611
I came here
knowing all that.

1160
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:52,480
But let's be real, you also
got a quota to meet.

1161
01:17:52,482 --> 01:17:53,582
Now I'm not calling you

1162
01:17:53,584 --> 01:17:55,150
- a predator...
- Sir.

1163
01:17:55,152 --> 01:17:56,351
But you're trying
to make your money.

1164
01:17:56,353 --> 01:17:57,586
- So let me help you do that.
- Sir.

1165
01:17:57,588 --> 01:18:00,055
That's not the way
this works.

1166
01:18:00,057 --> 01:18:01,590
You can give me whatever deal you
gotta give me. I don't care what it is.

1167
01:18:01,592 --> 01:18:03,961
'Cause unlike all the other
people that default,

1168
01:18:05,129 --> 01:18:07,663
this is the only house
I'll ever want.

1169
01:18:07,665 --> 01:18:10,900
So I'll never miss
a monthly bill, ever.

1170
01:18:10,902 --> 01:18:12,467
You can give me
your highest interest rate.

1171
01:18:12,469 --> 01:18:14,203
I completely
understand how you feel, sir.

1172
01:18:14,205 --> 01:18:15,671
You can give me your highest
interest rate, okay?

1173
01:18:15,673 --> 01:18:17,138
- Fuck... Fuck me.
- No, I completely...

1174
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,407
You don't even
have to feel bad.

1175
01:18:18,409 --> 01:18:19,577
You don't even
have to feel bad.

1176
01:18:20,678 --> 01:18:23,548
Okay? I will pay back
every single cent.

1177
01:18:25,582 --> 01:18:27,650
I'm sorry, sir.

1178
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:29,988
I will pay back
every single cent.

1179
01:18:32,423 --> 01:18:35,056
Okay, okay, you win!

1180
01:18:36,259 --> 01:18:38,095
Okay, yep, it's yours.

1181
01:18:38,995 --> 01:18:41,195
You charming
bastard, okay.

1182
01:18:41,197 --> 01:18:43,168
Talk to you
soon, buh-bye.

1183
01:18:44,936 --> 01:18:46,534
How's it going, man?

1184
01:18:46,536 --> 01:18:47,872
Fine, sir.

1185
01:18:49,406 --> 01:18:51,476
I noticed the house we
discussed is now for sale.

1186
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:55,644
There are some alarming
elements in your literature

1187
01:18:55,646 --> 01:18:57,946
I thought
you would like to know.

1188
01:18:57,948 --> 01:19:00,349
And certainly the Bureau
of Real Estate would.

1189
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,419
Uh-huh.

1190
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:04,552
This claims

1191
01:19:04,554 --> 01:19:06,555
the property has a view
of the Golden Gate.

1192
01:19:06,557 --> 01:19:08,157
Which...

1193
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,059
I don't think is true.

1194
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:11,392
Well,

1195
01:19:11,394 --> 01:19:12,694
it isn't. It isn't true.

1196
01:19:12,696 --> 01:19:14,629
It also claims
to have all the original

1197
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:16,565
"fixtures, floors,
and faucets."

1198
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:18,066
Isn't true.

1199
01:19:18,068 --> 01:19:19,301
And are you planning
on disclosing

1200
01:19:19,303 --> 01:19:20,970
that there's no septic tank?

1201
01:19:20,972 --> 01:19:24,105
Which means, any day now,

1202
01:19:24,107 --> 01:19:26,143
the garden could be flooded

1203
01:19:26,744 --> 01:19:28,179
with shit.

1204
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,413
Where's this going, man?

1205
01:19:32,415 --> 01:19:34,516
Well...

1206
01:19:34,518 --> 01:19:37,685
All this together seems
like false advertisement.

1207
01:19:37,687 --> 01:19:39,488
Which is grounds
for void a sale.

1208
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:41,523
Potential revoke of license.

1209
01:19:41,525 --> 01:19:43,495
I thought
it might've been you guys.

1210
01:19:47,764 --> 01:19:49,934
What's your deal, man?

1211
01:19:51,102 --> 01:19:52,336
Don't have a deal.

1212
01:19:53,737 --> 01:19:55,572
Hmm. Look...

1213
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,172
Somebody on this floor

1214
01:19:58,174 --> 01:19:59,677
would've gotten that house
if it wasn't me.

1215
01:20:00,777 --> 01:20:03,180
At least I'm
from here, right?

1216
01:20:04,714 --> 01:20:06,582
I put your stuff
on the street

1217
01:20:06,584 --> 01:20:08,316
- as a favor.
- Okay.

1218
01:20:08,318 --> 01:20:09,485
I could've had it
trucked away,

1219
01:20:09,487 --> 01:20:10,685
but I left it
out for you.

1220
01:20:10,687 --> 01:20:12,721
Look, dick wad.

1221
01:20:12,723 --> 01:20:14,757
I'm not fucking around,
I will report you.

1222
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:16,525
For what?

1223
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:19,328
Listing a view of the bridge?
And fixtures?

1224
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,596
Everybody does that.

1225
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:22,765
I literally copy-pasted
that shit.

1226
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:24,635
Well, you're lying about
the history of the house.

1227
01:20:25,702 --> 01:20:27,202
I'm not lying about that.

1228
01:20:27,204 --> 01:20:28,736
Yes, you are!
You say it was built

1229
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:30,439
one hundred years earlier
than it actually was.

1230
01:20:30,441 --> 01:20:32,074
Look, I'm not
making this up.

1231
01:20:32,076 --> 01:20:33,508
Yes, you are!

1232
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:36,177
James Fails built
this house in 1946.

1233
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:37,712
- James?
- Fails!

1234
01:20:37,714 --> 01:20:39,614
What are you talking about?

1235
01:20:39,616 --> 01:20:41,018
Look, man.

1236
01:20:44,155 --> 01:20:46,154
Deed of Trust, 1857.

1237
01:20:46,156 --> 01:20:49,059
Architect Gil-hoo-ley,
some shit.

1238
01:20:51,128 --> 01:20:54,128
Your guy Fails lost it
in the '90s.

1239
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,467
See, right there.

1240
01:20:57,101 --> 01:20:58,766
Look, man.

1241
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:01,369
If you need a week to find
somewhere else, then take it.

1242
01:21:01,371 --> 01:21:03,337
But...

1243
01:21:03,339 --> 01:21:07,011
Don't go pulling some squatters
rights shit on me, man.

1244
01:21:08,745 --> 01:21:10,114
I got your mail.

1245
01:21:12,249 --> 01:21:14,115
I know your name.

1246
01:21:14,117 --> 01:21:15,652
I don't want
to call the cops.

1247
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,555
I don't want
to do that to you.

1248
01:22:10,573 --> 01:22:11,709
Where'd you go?

1249
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,679
Doesn't matter, bro.

1250
01:22:18,482 --> 01:22:20,382
I got everything inside.

1251
01:22:20,384 --> 01:22:21,786
Except the couch.

1252
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,189
That shit almost fell on me.

1253
01:22:29,626 --> 01:22:31,095
Jim...

1254
01:22:32,729 --> 01:22:34,428
I spoke to the realtor.

1255
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:35,799
Yeah, fuck that guy.

1256
01:22:41,304 --> 01:22:42,639
He's gonna throw us out.

1257
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:46,443
And eventually
call the cops.

1258
01:22:48,879 --> 01:22:51,249
I don't know how much longer
we can keep doing this.

1259
01:22:54,285 --> 01:22:55,854
I understand if you can't.

1260
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,223
I do.

1261
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:00,892
But I'm not leaving.

1262
01:23:06,729 --> 01:23:09,500
- Jim, he said your grand...
- Where am I gonna go?

1263
01:23:11,768 --> 01:23:13,504
My dad's in the SRO.

1264
01:23:15,472 --> 01:23:17,509
My aunt's out
in bum fuck.

1265
01:23:19,843 --> 01:23:21,312
My mom...

1266
01:23:22,713 --> 01:23:25,750
Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

1267
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,887
I'm not leaving, bro.

1268
01:23:33,557 --> 01:23:35,226
I'm the last one left.

1269
01:23:41,631 --> 01:23:42,933
We have my house.

1270
01:23:47,972 --> 01:23:49,807
I can't go
back there, bro.

1271
01:23:54,945 --> 01:23:56,313
Mont,

1272
01:23:57,481 --> 01:23:58,550
this house...

1273
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,284
This is what I do.

1274
01:24:03,286 --> 01:24:04,888
Hey, it's what
we do, Mont.

1275
01:24:06,389 --> 01:24:07,758
This is our shit.

1276
01:24:08,592 --> 01:24:10,228
We can't give up now.

1277
01:24:10,827 --> 01:24:12,330
We gotta fight.

1278
01:24:13,897 --> 01:24:15,200
Right?

1279
01:24:20,304 --> 01:24:21,472
Yeah.

1280
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:27,211
I'm with you, bro.

1281
01:24:28,411 --> 01:24:29,680
You always been
with me.

1282
01:24:55,406 --> 01:24:56,908
Oh, shit,
you're writing?

1283
01:24:58,474 --> 01:25:00,441
Yeah. Uh...

1284
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:02,013
I think I cracked a play.

1285
01:25:04,848 --> 01:25:06,414
I'd like to put it on
next week,

1286
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:07,584
if that's all right?

1287
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,320
Hell, yeah, get it, bro!

01:27:57,687 --> 01:27:59,022
Hella fuckin' early.

1323
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:04,027
Here we go.

1324
01:28:15,772 --> 01:28:17,442
Why are you dressed
like a white boy?

1325
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:23,011
Oh...

1326
01:28:23,013 --> 01:28:24,782
It's for your
little show, huh?

1327
01:28:45,635 --> 01:28:48,104
Man.

1328
01:28:56,045 --> 01:28:58,115
You mess up my daddy's
chair, Montgomery?

1329
01:29:00,717 --> 01:29:02,182
Huh?

1330
01:29:02,184 --> 01:29:03,584
No.

1331
01:29:03,586 --> 01:29:04,752
No, sir, we...
We were just...

1332
01:29:04,754 --> 01:29:06,053
What you stuttering for?

1333
01:29:06,055 --> 01:29:08,192
You got stage fright
already? Huh?

1334
01:29:09,559 --> 01:29:10,628
No.

1335
01:29:13,296 --> 01:29:15,763
I don't care about
the chair, son.

1336
01:29:18,634 --> 01:29:19,970
But be easy with it.

1337
01:29:21,204 --> 01:29:22,607
Thank you.

1338
01:29:24,206 --> 01:29:26,177
Carry on.

1339
01:29:59,675 --> 01:30:00,878
Phew.

1340
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,983
My daddy hated
when I played that shit.

1341
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,931
Yeah, come on in,
don't be shy.

1342
01:30:21,263 --> 01:30:23,099
His grandpa built it.

1343
01:30:24,267 --> 01:30:25,967
Not bad for
a black man, huh?

1344
01:30:25,969 --> 01:30:28,035
Oh, no.

1345
01:30:28,037 --> 01:30:29,169
Very good.

1346
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:30,739
Very good.

1347
01:30:38,014 --> 01:30:39,748
So, this is gonna
be interesting.

1348
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,018
This is nice.

1349
01:30:41,985 --> 01:30:43,717
- Nice crowd, too.
- Yeah.

1350
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:46,053
You make a lot of money
on candy?

1351
01:30:46,055 --> 01:30:47,721
Sell candy?

1352
01:30:47,723 --> 01:30:49,289
- I used to, for years.
- Oh, yeah?

1353
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:51,092
Most of these
new white people

1354
01:30:51,094 --> 01:30:53,028
that's moving in these
black neighborhoods,

1355
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,995
they don't even know they
standing in the kitchen

1356
01:30:54,997 --> 01:30:57,666
- where a dude got shot at.
- Mmm.

1357
01:30:57,668 --> 01:30:59,234
I didn't know he was
doing a play and shit.

1358
01:30:59,236 --> 01:31:01,069
He just invited us,

1359
01:31:01,071 --> 01:31:02,236
I don't know what weird
shit they got goin' on,

1360
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:03,771
but it's pretty weird.

1361
01:31:16,385 --> 01:31:18,054
What I'mma hit you for?

1362
01:31:18,821 --> 01:31:20,090
You my folks.

1363
01:31:23,192 --> 01:31:24,394
All right.

1364
01:31:25,295 --> 01:31:27,462
All right.

1365
01:31:27,464 --> 01:31:29,800
But I can't have soft niggas
hanging around me.

1366
01:31:34,905 --> 01:31:36,072
Hit me.

1367
01:31:38,407 --> 01:31:40,175
Nah!

1368
01:31:40,177 --> 01:31:41,245
Nah! For what, nigga?

1369
01:31:42,312 --> 01:31:43,414
Hit me.

1370
01:31:44,246 --> 01:31:46,683
Man up, nigga. Man up!

1371
01:31:48,985 --> 01:31:50,217
No, bro!

1372
01:31:50,219 --> 01:31:51,988
No! No, bro, no!

1373
01:31:54,057 --> 01:31:55,358
Oh, you soft.

1374
01:31:57,227 --> 01:31:59,793
You soft, nigga.

1375
01:31:59,795 --> 01:32:02,262
They gonna call you
a bitch at your funeral.

1376
01:32:02,264 --> 01:32:03,731
I ain't no bitch!

1377
01:32:03,733 --> 01:32:05,900
I ain't no bitch! I'm a man!

1378
01:32:05,902 --> 01:32:07,204
Then hit me.

1379
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:10,241
Hit me, bro. Hit me.

1380
01:32:12,275 --> 01:32:13,341
Hit me, nigga.

1381
01:32:24,754 --> 01:32:25,819
All right!

1382
01:32:25,821 --> 01:32:26,954
All right!

1383
01:32:26,956 --> 01:32:28,056
Yeah!

1384
01:32:28,058 --> 01:32:29,324
Here, nigga.

1385
01:32:29,326 --> 01:32:30,795
I don't give a fuck.

1386
01:32:31,327 --> 01:32:32,961
Come see me, nigga.

1387
01:32:32,963 --> 01:32:34,762
Who out there hiding?

1388
01:32:34,764 --> 01:32:35,864
Man up!

1389
01:32:35,866 --> 01:32:36,998
Man up, nigga!

1390
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,065
- Man up!
- Hey!

1391
01:32:45,174 --> 01:32:46,975
No words.

1392
01:32:46,977 --> 01:32:48,211
No words!

1393
01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:51,215
Please send e-hugs.

01:33:20,376 --> 01:33:21,745
who knew Kofi?

1405
01:33:24,013 --> 01:33:27,317
Got yelled at by my bitch
boss for being late!

1406
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:29,184
Sorry!

1407
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:31,155
There's no timer for grief.

Man! Can't believe
we lost my bro!

1411
01:33:43,834 --> 01:33:45,900
But you wouldn't want me
to be sad, Ko,

1412
01:33:45,902 --> 01:33:48,903
so I put my pain
into my music!

Mr. Tuck

1416
01:33:55,946 --> 01:33:57,515
moved to Florida

1417
01:33:58,447 --> 01:33:59,784
ten years ago!

1418
01:34:00,983 --> 01:34:02,550
Are these the people

1419
01:34:02,552 --> 01:34:04,121
who knew Kofi?

1420
01:34:05,589 --> 01:34:08,259
Kofi had dimensions.

1421
01:34:09,392 --> 01:34:10,925
More than a...

1422
01:34:10,927 --> 01:34:13,464
A post could reflect
or a play could capture.

1423
01:34:16,098 --> 01:34:17,300
So I summon you.

1424
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:21,368
Celebrate the life he lived.

1425
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:23,637
Not through those
who speak the loudest.

1426
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:26,309
But through the memories
he left us all.

1427
01:34:27,611 --> 01:34:29,409
Ma'am!

1428
01:34:29,411 --> 01:34:31,214
- Me?
- Mmm. How will you...

1429
01:34:32,514 --> 01:34:34,351
How will you remember Kofi?

1430
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:38,822
Um...

1431
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:41,892
Um...

1432
01:34:43,927 --> 01:34:47,095
He, you know,
he used to come and walk my niece

1433
01:34:47,097 --> 01:34:50,565
home from school when
she first moved up here.

1434
01:34:50,567 --> 01:34:53,167
He was a little gentleman,
or whatnot,

1435
01:34:53,169 --> 01:34:55,439
you know, sweet, um...

1436
01:34:57,006 --> 01:34:58,409
It's just sad.

1437
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,074
Mmm.

1438
01:35:01,076 --> 01:35:04,678
- I coached Kofi in Pop Warner.
- Mmm-hmm.

1439
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:07,183
He stayed behind
and helped me pack up.

1440
01:35:07,951 --> 01:35:09,320
Every day.

1441
01:35:10,353 --> 01:35:11,522
Yeah.

1442
01:35:13,956 --> 01:35:15,459
And how 'bout you,
young man?

1443
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:22,499
Shit, man.

1444
01:35:24,233 --> 01:35:25,535
I don't know.

1445
01:35:27,637 --> 01:35:29,273
Did I push him
too hard?

1446
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:33,009
Kofi was my nigga, man.

1447
01:35:37,046 --> 01:35:38,482
Did I push him too hard?

1448
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:49,126
Mmm. How 'bout you?

1449
01:35:56,198 --> 01:35:57,567
Well...

1450
01:35:59,635 --> 01:36:01,371
My last memory of Kofi

1451
01:36:02,638 --> 01:36:04,307
was him talking shit to me.

1452
01:36:07,009 --> 01:36:09,177
He said some of
the most fucked-up shit

1453
01:36:09,179 --> 01:36:10,948
anybody's ever said to me.

1454
01:36:14,718 --> 01:36:16,684
But Kofi also got jumped

1455
01:36:16,686 --> 01:36:18,285
for defending me
against the older kids

1456
01:36:18,287 --> 01:36:19,589
in the group home.

1457
01:36:20,723 --> 01:36:22,358
He didn't like to fight,

1458
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,296
but he fought for me then.

1459
01:36:28,665 --> 01:36:30,301
People aren't one thing.

1460
01:36:40,076 --> 01:36:41,278
That.

1461
01:36:45,115 --> 01:36:46,416
All...

1462
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:48,552
All of it.

1463
01:36:51,653 --> 01:36:53,357
What would have happened

1464
01:36:54,256 --> 01:36:56,160
if Kofi could've

1465
01:36:57,259 --> 01:36:58,594
showed himself?

1466
01:36:59,763 --> 01:37:02,131
All forms of himself.

1467
01:37:05,434 --> 01:37:07,004
The world

1468
01:37:09,071 --> 01:37:10,406
put him in a box!

1469
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:14,409
And he never

1470
01:37:14,411 --> 01:37:15,612
pushed beyond it.

1471
01:37:20,215 --> 01:37:21,418
Let us.

1472
01:37:22,485 --> 01:37:24,621
Let us break the boxes!

1473
01:37:26,055 --> 01:37:28,588
Let us give each other
the courage!

1474
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:29,625
To... To see!

1475
01:37:30,626 --> 01:37:33,530
Beyond the stories
we are born into!

1476
01:37:35,298 --> 01:37:36,433
Let us all

1477
01:37:37,834 --> 01:37:39,103
really look

1478
01:37:39,701 --> 01:37:42,171
at Jimmie Fails IV.

1479
01:37:51,246 --> 01:37:52,715
Self-taught historian.

1480
01:37:54,183 --> 01:37:55,485
Carpenter.

1481
01:37:56,518 --> 01:37:58,653
Gentle, loving man.

1482
01:37:58,655 --> 01:38:01,221
A true survivor. Jimmie!

1483
01:38:01,223 --> 01:38:03,190
How many places
have you lived?

1484
01:38:03,192 --> 01:38:05,193
And if they kicked
you out tomorrow,

1485
01:38:05,195 --> 01:38:08,096
you would still
be all those things!

1486
01:38:08,098 --> 01:38:10,131
You exist beyond the...

1487
01:38:10,133 --> 01:38:13,333
These walls,
you extend beyond your...

1488
01:38:13,335 --> 01:38:15,302
Your... Your forefathers!

1489
01:38:15,304 --> 01:38:17,337
You are
more than this house!

1490
01:38:17,339 --> 01:38:19,574
Jimmie, you are not these...
These walls!

1491
01:38:19,576 --> 01:38:21,309
You're not these floors,
you're not this ceiling!

1492
01:38:21,311 --> 01:38:23,377
- It's time you know!
- Bro, what are you doing?

1493
01:38:23,379 --> 01:38:24,811
- What are you doing?
- It is time!

1494
01:38:24,813 --> 01:38:26,646
- It is time you know!
- I don't need to know,

1495
01:38:26,648 --> 01:38:29,419
I don't need to know.
Let's stop. Let's stop.

1496
01:38:32,522 --> 01:38:34,489
- Jimmie... You don't!
- Enough, stop!

1497
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:36,289
- Please, stop. Mont!
- Jimmie!

1498
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:37,492
Your grandpa
didn't build this house!

1499
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:38,528
Enough!

1500
01:38:43,165 --> 01:38:44,567
He didn't build it,
Jimmie!

1501
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:56,213
Yes, he did.

1502
01:38:58,414 --> 01:39:01,181
- He built this house!
- He didn't, I saw it, man,

1503
01:39:01,183 --> 01:39:02,385
I saw the deed.

1504
01:39:04,521 --> 01:39:06,523
I saw it.

1505
01:39:40,322 --> 01:39:42,593
I don't know
what the hell that thing was.

1506
01:39:56,772 --> 01:39:58,605
Then he shoots
a left. Psh!

1507
01:39:58,607 --> 01:40:00,543
Ha!

1508
01:40:01,277 --> 01:40:02,842
Man, let 'em leave.

1509
01:40:02,844 --> 01:40:04,847
They don't deserve
to be in here anyway.

1510
01:40:10,519 --> 01:40:12,222
Neither do we.

1511
01:40:16,259 --> 01:40:17,658
You gonna really listen
to what

1512
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:19,530
another-ass nigga
tell you what's true?

1513
01:40:21,798 --> 01:40:24,632
Come on, Jayboe,
get your spine up, son.

1514
01:40:24,634 --> 01:40:26,870
- Have some pride, man.
- I've been doin'.

1515
01:40:35,711 --> 01:40:36,879
But you say it.

1516
01:40:38,781 --> 01:40:40,250
Say what?

1517
01:40:42,552 --> 01:40:43,687
The truth.

1518
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:47,288
What?

1519
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:49,226
That grandpa
didn't build this house.

1520
01:40:50,626 --> 01:40:52,959
Tsk. Man, get outta here
with that bullshit.

1521
01:40:52,961 --> 01:40:54,564
Come on, Jayboe.

1522
01:41:00,836 --> 01:41:02,371
Just say it.

1523
01:41:16,619 --> 01:41:17,920
Can't tell you shit.

1524
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:23,490
I'm outta here, man.

1525
01:41:23,492 --> 01:41:25,394
You sit in that
bullshit if you want.

1526
01:42:56,152 --> 01:42:57,654
Jayboe.

1527
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:07,930
I been telling people
he built it for so long.

1528
01:43:13,568 --> 01:43:15,504
Almost forgot it wasn't true.

1529
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:22,913
This was ours.

1530
01:43:23,946 --> 01:43:25,349
And then it wasn't.

1531
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:29,717
So you just tell yourself
what you need

1532
01:43:29,719 --> 01:43:31,722
to make you feel
like it still is.

1533
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:36,593
Shit.

1534
01:43:37,593 --> 01:43:38,762
I did it, too.

1535
01:43:44,133 --> 01:43:45,669
It makes you feel

1536
01:43:47,469 --> 01:43:48,804
special.

1537
01:43:51,773 --> 01:43:53,740
But you got a chance
to get out

1538
01:43:53,742 --> 01:43:55,611
from underneath
all of that now.

1539
01:43:57,914 --> 01:43:59,448
I don't want to.

1540
01:44:01,651 --> 01:44:02,986
I just want it.

1541
01:44:07,055 --> 01:44:08,558
Is that what
you really want?

1542
01:44:11,893 --> 01:44:15,064
To spend the rest of your
life working for this?

1543
01:44:16,732 --> 01:44:18,168
Fighting for this?

1544
01:44:22,472 --> 01:44:24,571
I believe that

1545
01:44:24,573 --> 01:44:26,039
you could make
this place yours.

1546
01:44:26,041 --> 01:44:27,544
I really do.

1547
01:44:34,983 --> 01:44:36,486
But if you leave

1548
01:44:40,857 --> 01:44:42,626
it's not your loss.

1549
01:44:44,594 --> 01:44:46,196
It's San Francisco's.

1550
01:44:53,035 --> 01:44:54,938
Fuck San Francisco.

1551
01:45:37,213 --> 01:45:39,212
- This city blows.
- Big time.

1552
01:45:39,214 --> 01:45:41,047
I mean, whatever,
I'm not above

1553
01:45:41,049 --> 01:45:43,816
living in a former
crack house, you know?

1554
01:45:43,818 --> 01:45:46,252
But, I came here for Janis
and the Airplane,

1555
01:45:46,254 --> 01:45:48,721
not to work
at a fucking startup.

1556
01:45:48,723 --> 01:45:50,591
Dude, I've been saying
for months,

1557
01:45:50,593 --> 01:45:52,226
let's just move to East LA.

1558
01:45:52,228 --> 01:45:53,663
This city's dead.

1559
01:45:54,196 --> 01:45:55,663
Nah.

1560
01:45:55,665 --> 01:45:57,067
Seriously,
fuck this city.

1561
01:45:59,201 --> 01:46:00,570
'Scuse me?

1562
01:46:03,572 --> 01:46:05,207
You don't get to hate
San Francisco.

1563
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:10,514
I'm sorry, what?

1564
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,913
Yeah, dude, I mean...

1565
01:46:12,915 --> 01:46:14,784
Sorry, but I'll hate
what I want.

1566
01:46:17,353 --> 01:46:18,788
Do you love it?

1567
01:46:20,956 --> 01:46:23,058
It's... I mean yeah,
I'm here.

1568
01:46:24,026 --> 01:46:25,629
But do I have
to love it?

1569
01:46:27,095 --> 01:46:29,064
You don't get to hate it
unless you love it.

1570
01:46:32,367 --> 01:46:34,036
Classic Muni shit.

1571
01:46:43,879 --> 01:46:46,680
Who call the money man,
come on now, hurry up.

1572
01:46:46,682 --> 01:46:47,717
Pay attention!

1573
01:46:50,286 --> 01:46:52,285
Alexander the Great
was a black man.

1574
01:46:52,287 --> 01:46:54,857
They don't teach you that
in the devil school system.

1575
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:59,562
I can't take another day
of this bullshit.

1576
01:48:07,463 --> 01:48:09,131
Oh, Jim.

1577
01:48:15,137 --> 01:48:16,706
I'm sorry I did that.

1578
01:48:19,407 --> 01:48:20,977
It was a stupid play.

1579
01:48:24,245 --> 01:48:25,881
Nah.

1580
01:48:27,049 --> 01:48:28,985
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you the truth.

1581
01:48:32,787 --> 01:48:34,723
I just wanted it to be true.

1582
01:48:36,959 --> 01:48:38,394
It felt so good, you know?

1583
01:48:44,834 --> 01:48:46,001
It's okay.

1584
01:49:05,521 --> 01:49:07,221
Hey, Jimmie.

1585
01:49:07,223 --> 01:49:08,425
Are you hungry?

1586
01:49:09,258 --> 01:49:10,727
Fucking starving.

1587
01:49:16,064 --> 01:49:18,364
He's giving up.

1588
01:49:18,366 --> 01:49:20,434
I can't take no more.

1589
01:49:21,903 --> 01:49:23,002
He's breaking down.

1590
01:49:23,004 --> 01:49:24,837
Oh, wow.

1591
01:49:24,839 --> 01:49:26,073
He's really
tearing this apartment apart.

1592
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:30,177
This looks exciting
though, you know?

1593
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:32,779
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.
- Yeah? Oh, yeah?

1594
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:37,417
- Oh! I got it now.
- Oh!

1595
01:49:37,419 --> 01:49:39,185
He seems like
he's horny or something.

1596
01:49:45,427 --> 01:49:47,097
He's banging
on the door again.

1597
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:24,096
<i>I will.</i>

1598
01:50:24,098 --> 01:50:25,498
<i>I'm leaving
San Francisco today,</i>

1599
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,133
<i>but I'll be back
in about a week,</i>

1600
01:50:27,135 --> 01:50:28,202
<i>I'll take care of it
for you then.</i>

1601
01:50:29,604 --> 01:50:31,238
<i>Well,
I've seen him worse.</i>

1602
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:32,940
<i>Well have
a nice time, Bert.</i>

1603
01:50:32,942 --> 01:50:33,574
- <i>Yeah, thanks.</i>
- <i>Why don't you...</i>

1604
01:53:50,115 --> 01:53:55,115
