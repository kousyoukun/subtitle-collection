1
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,430
[man breathing heavily]

2
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,398
[woman] Jasmine?

3
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,986
Jasmine! We gonna be late. Come on.

4
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:17,994
Let's go.

5
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,908
[man] Why do they have on these suits
and we don't?

6
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,915
Something's going on right in our face.

7
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:29,292
Y'all so stuck in those iPhones,
J-Phone 12s or whatever.

8
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,251
Blow up in your hand.

9
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,585
You can't Google
what's going on right now!

10
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,137
Are y'all paying attention?

11
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,510
Why do they have on these suits
if we don't?

12
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,102
Why?

13
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,439
They here to clean this water?

14
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,108
When this water been dirtier
than the devil's mouth for 50 years.

15
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,438
And now they want to clean it?

16
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,408
They got plans for us, man.

17
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,653
Looking like George Jetson rejects.

18
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,863
'Cause they weak!

19
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,495
Weak hearts! Weak lungs!

20
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,827
Can't even breathe up here without a mask.

21
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,460
But we was put through hell
to be purified.

22
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,389
You know what I'm sayin',
brothers and sisters?

23
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,762
Man,
it's crazy what jail will do to a nigga.

24
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,141
They don't care about they water, man.
There's something going on.

25
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,971
We gonna get to the bottom of it.

26
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,975
And they lucky I'm a man of God right now!

27
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,810
You think he rehearses this every morning?

28
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,816
[preacher]
Or they would catch these hands.

29
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,402
Seems a bit more impromptu.

30
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,699
2019 out here!

31
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,779
We been yellin' about this water
since before they were born.

32
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,830
Before they were born!

33
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,082
Where's this bus, man?
We're not gonna make it.

34
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,712
[preacher] Y'all leave us the hell alone.
Unless y'all really here to help us.

35
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,134
We'll get there.

36
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,052
[preacher] They got plans for us, man.

37
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,721
- We're not gonna make it, bro.
- [preacher] Not for you and me.

38
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,972
So I urge you! Fight for your land!

39
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,557
Fight for your home!

40
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,061
- Fight for your...
- Let's skate.

41
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,870
[preacher] This here?
This is the edge, bro!

42
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,040
The final frontier of Manifest Destiny.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,291
Last edge of the city.

44
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,797
Man, two steps further,
you'll be drinking that filthy saltwater.

45
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,474
But we built these ships,
dredged these canals,

46
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,391
in the San Francisco
they never knew existed.

47
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,149
And now they come to build something new?

48
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,831
Whole blocks half in the past,
half in the future.

49
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,620
But should you venture
into their San Francisco,

50
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,956
the one they pillaged for gold!

51
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,004
Remember your truth!

52
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,753
In the city of facades.

53
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:20,067
Take me with you! Hey! Hey!
Take me with you, man!

54
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,820
Come on, where are we going?
Where are we going?

55
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,649
[yelling maniacally]

56
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,029
Come on, I'm coming! I'm coming!

57
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:39,041
[preacher] Look at them look at you.
Look down at you.

58
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,752
<i>But we built them!</i>

59
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,633
<i>We are these homes!</i>

60
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,760
<i>Their eyes...</i>

61
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,263
<i>their pointed brims.</i>

62
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,018
<i>We move if they move.</i>

63
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,140
<i>Our sweat soaked in the wood.</i>

64
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,148
<i>Gilded in our image.</i>

65
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,316
<i>This is our home!</i>

66
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,323
<i>Our home!</i>

67
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,949
<i>Our home.</i>

68
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,542
Thanks.

69
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,590
Are you sure they're gone?

70
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,858
Jim?

71
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,986
I mean, their car is gone.

72
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,906
Let's check the back, man.

73
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,449
[people chattering indistinctly]

74
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,276
Good morning. How are you?

75
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,344
Remember that time
they were in the kitchen?

76
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,080
Jim!

77
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,287
Remember the kitchen?

78
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,751
Yeah, sure.

79
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,587
But, bruh.

80
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,046
Didn't I tell you these railings
are periwinkle, not black.

81
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,101
Mm-hmm.

82
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,435
Yeah, I got it.

83
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,106
We gotta start coming more
than every two weeks, bro.

84
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,772
This fuckin' garden's a nightmare.

85
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,568
- I'll bring my grandpa's tools next time.
- Please do.

86
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,710
Wallpaper's chipping.

87
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,676
These people are killing this house.

88
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,431
[Montgomery]
You're not goin' in, though, Jim.

89
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
[Jimmie] I mean...

90
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,807
I mean...

91
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,356
no.

92
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,601
They're definitely gone, though.

93
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,311
Better be quick this time. Hmm?

94
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,942
Yeah, I know.

95
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,649
Takes time.

96
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,742
Yeah, I know.

97
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,328
- I'll be at my spot.
- All right.

98
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,375
Quick.

99
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,083
Okay.

100
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,443
- Jesus, man!
- [man] Honey.

101
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,199
Just get the heck out of here, man.

102
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,933
- What the fuck?
- [man] He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

103
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,368
[Mary] He's painting the house now?

104
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,918
- Well, yeah.
- Stop fixing my house!

105
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,666
I'm almost done. Just hold on.

106
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,419
[scoffs] Why don't you just paint
the neighbors' houses?

107
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,546
- Theirs are worse than ours.
- Just hold on one second.

108
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,845
[man] I mean, we appreciate it,
in some way, but, yeah.

109
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,931
It's weird, man.

110
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,348
I'm almost done.

111
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,386
Look, we will call the cops, man.
And I mean it this time.

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,767
No, we're not gonna call the cops.

113
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,190
We're not calling the cops.
Just stop coming back.

114
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,939
I'm almost done. Hold on. Please, hold on.

115
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,487
Ugh! Just get off my fucking birdie bath.

116
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,657
Ugh! Get outta here, man.

117
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,700
- Those were $3.
- [Jimmie] Fine.

118
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,073
I'll finish it next time. God!

119
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,953
Next time? Oh, just get...
Get the heck off my birdie bath!

120
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,909
Just water the plants in the back
or I will.

121
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,670
Oh!

122
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,706
[Jimmie] Bro!
You were supposed to be the lookout.

123
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,881
[Montgomery] Mm-hmm.

124
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,653
[Jimmie] You were the one
that was so worried.

125
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,884
[Montgomery] I got distracted.

126
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,555
Bro!

127
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,886
What if OG is right, though?

128
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,843
You really gotta stop eating
the fish out there.

129
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,581
- I think it's fine.
- [shouting indistinctly]

130
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,971
All fish has mercury.

131
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,935
I know,
but I saw a seagull with a dick, bro.

132
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,478
Well, so I guess it's a male.

133
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,275
No, bro, like a human dick.

134
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,617
[man 1] Oh, nasty-ass tumble-weave. Pussy.

135
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,572
- Wild, bro.
- Wassup, nigga?

136
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,353
Ain't tryin' do nothin'.
I ain't tryin' do that bullshit...

137
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,730
- Stop playin' before I slap your face.
- Man, shut your ass up, nigga.

138
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,962
- [laughing]
- [man 2] I ain't finna chase you.

139
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,334
You play too much, bro.

140
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,757
You lucky I don't beat your ass out here,
bro.

141
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,552
- Kofi! What's good, brother?
- What's up with y'all?

142
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,800
Hey,
you know I seen Moms last night, right?

143
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,803
She was looking like she was
missing a little bit on the top.

144
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,385
I mean, we shower in the same water, Jim.

145
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,220
[people chattering indistinctly]

146
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,314
[chattering stops]

147
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,645
So, niggas takin' showers together now?

148
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,147
Probably was.

149
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,525
That's fruity.

150
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,037
I was trying to tell him
not to eat the fish

151
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,705
because the water is toxic.

152
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:11,377
Well, duh. That's 'cause they built
the atomic bomb right there, nigga.

153
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,377
[gulls calling]

154
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,591
I don't think that's true.

155
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,885
What'd he say?

156
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,379
- Damn.
- Breath stink. That's true.

157
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,646
Bro, them shoes ain't true.

158
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,974
I know your Jesus-lookin' ass
ain't talkin', bro.

159
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,521
- Them things is phony.
- They're definitely phony.

160
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,231
- What about cuz, man?

People like me.

324
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,078
I'm liked.

325
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,914
Lonely ass nigga.

326
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,502
When the last time
you hung out with your daddy?

327
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,889
Couple weeks ago. I don't know.

328
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,517
Couple weeks ago?
The nigga needs you today.

329
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,598
Shit.

330
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,852
That's what...
That's what people have kids for,

331
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,856
so they can have some companionship,
somebody to hang out with.

332
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,773
That's why I ain't had no kids.
'Cause I don't wanna be bothered.

333
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,574
Your daddy don't want
this fuckin' car, man.

334
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,072
- [Jimmie] Hey.
- [man] Hmm?

335
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,993
- [Montgomery] Wasn't that the Savoy House?
- [man] Oh, sure was.

336
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,834
It was 100 motherfuckers in there,
rent-controlled.

337
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,587
They thought they owned that shit.

338
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,089
The landlord burned
all of the people out of there.

339
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,388
'Cause, see, Jimmie,
you never really own shit.

340
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,258
This car ain't mine.

341
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,181
But it never was yours. [laughing]

342
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,353
- [thudding]
- [machinery whirring]

343
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,776
You never own shit! [laughing]

344
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,734
[people chattering indistinctly]

345
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,863
What the fuck?

346
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,990
[woman sobbing]

347
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,552
Hey, what's goin' on, man?

348
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,754
[man] <i>No sé,</i> bro.

349
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,723
[sobbing continues]

350
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,893
Uh, sir?

351
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,816
What's-What's going on?

352
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,235
[chuckles] Oh, God.

353
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,903
She's moving.

354
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,982
Fighting like crazy with her sister.

355
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,074
When someone dies in the family,
that's what white people do.

356
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,661
"This is for her,
this is for him, this is mine."

357
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,912
Who's gonna have the house?

358
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,460
So they lost the house?

359
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,039
[man] Who's gonna possess the house?

360
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,093
They're just fighting
and fighting and fighting.

361
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,019
What's gonna happen to it now?

362
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,575
Why'd they have to move out
'cause her mom died?

363
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,830
I don't know.

364
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:23,209
They were... tasteless,
but at least they didn't fuck it up.

365
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,371
Well, that will be 10 bucks, hun.

366
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,546
Since when?

367
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,797
Since that's the best deal
you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

368
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,594
I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie. I said 16.

369
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,547
How I'm gonna eat 60 Twix?

370
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,182
I don't know your life.

371
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,468
[man] You act like you at Costco
or something like that.

372
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,728
You ain't at Costco.

373
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,147
[woman] Hey, you can go to Costco
if you need to.

374
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,794
- [man] You Rosco.
- [woman] Go right now.

375
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,605
[man]
Sixteen. First time you had a check.

376
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,187
- [voices fading]
- [Montgomery] Jim. Jim.

377
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,448
Jim.

378
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,070
Jim?

379
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,535
[man] So, gentlemen.

380
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,243
What can I do for you?

381
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,628
Yeah, we're curious about a house
on Golden Gate near Fillmore.

382
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,215
- Mm-hmm.
- [Jimmie] It's 959.

383
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,259
It's gray, it's got the gold trim.

384
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,382
- Uh, it's got...
- Yep, yep.

385
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,634
Yep, with the, um...

386
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,058
the witch hat.

387
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,719
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah!

388
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,125
I know exactly what you're talking about.

389
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,061
- That place is very special.
- [Jimmie] Hmm.

390
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,985
I used to drive past that house
on my way to school every day.

391
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,063
- [Jimmie] What school did you go to?
- I went to St. Ignatius.

392
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,815
You from here, too?

393
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,069
Yeah, third generation,

394
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,026
- I went to Reardon, actually.
- Really?

395
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,015
Yeah, we used to play y'all
in football all the time.

396
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,076
- You used to kill us in football.
- Yeah, yeah.

397
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,643
- [man laughs]
- I didn't wanna say that, but...

398
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,203
That's awesome, right on.

399
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,787
But, so, it's for sale?
I didn't hear about that.

400
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,668
Well, I'm not sure.

401
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,466
It seems like the owner and her sister
are fighting over it.

402
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,044
But I guess her mom died.

403
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,592
Ah, man.

404
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,808
I don't know.
That sounds like an estate thing.

405
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,101
That's a sucky situation.

406
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,683
But, I mean... [scoffs]

407
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,525
With a house like that, they could be
fighting over that for years.

408
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,856
While it just sits there.

409
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,031
It's a pity.

410
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,779
So it's really just... just empty?

411
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:23,117
[man] It's fucked up, right?
So fucked up. Like, it bothers me.

412
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,726
There's all these people in the street,

413
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,539
and these big old houses
are just sitting there collecting dust.

414
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,712
But shit, what else can you say?

415
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,958
The fucking injustice of it. [chuckles]

416
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,048
Yeah.

417
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,409
[doorknob rattling]

418
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,150
[shrieking]

419
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,568
[thudding]

420
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,906
[footsteps running]

421
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,530
[both whooping and laughing]

422
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,789
[Jimmie] Mont! We here, baby!

423
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,712
[exclaiming]

424
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,085
- [footsteps running]
- [grunting]

425
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,292
[yelling]

426
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,395
- [laughs]
- [thud]

427
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,185
[exhales]

428
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,732
[panting]

429
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,418
[tour guide, muffled]
Spoiling all the fun,

430
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:24,530
leveling most of this neighborhood
in the name of Urban Renewal.

431
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,738
Sorry about your homes
and your funky shops.

432
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:32,326
You can set up a shoeshine stand
in front of the parking lot at Safeway.

433
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,706
But you distinguished truth-seekers

434
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,960
want to know about the real hep cats
who hung out here,

435
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,417
in the "Harlem of the West,"

436
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,254
where a few of these homes did survive.

437
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:49,059
Like this beauty here,
which was built clear back in the 1800s.

438
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:54,056
Before the black thing,
this was all Japanese,

439
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,733
till FDR's stormtroopers
rounded them up into camps.

440
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,152
This house was built in the 1940s.

441
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,814
[tour guide chuckles]

442
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,740
Say hi to our neighbor here, everybody.

443
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,826
[all] Hi.

444
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:10,121
That would actually be
about 100 years late for this style.

445
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:13,245
We can see from his gingerbread trim,

446
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:17,170
this was built sometime in the 1850s.

447
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,339
Uh, 1946!

448
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,460
I'm gonna have to disagree
with you there, dude man.

449
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:27,797
No architect in the 1940s
was building in this style.

450
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,805
That's probably true,
but this wasn't built by an architect.

451
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,304
My grandfather built this.

452
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,941
He came here in World War Il,

453
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,520
he bought this lot,
and he built this house.

454
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,241
The stairs. These windows.

455
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,195
The columns. The archways.

456
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,159
The witch hat.

457
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,284
The balustrades. The fish scales.

458
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,373
This balcony.

459
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,501
That wall to keep y'all the fuck out.

460
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,584
All of it.

461
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:11,258
By Jimmie Fails I, with his own two hands.
In 1946.

462
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,306
[tour guide] Wow.

463
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,805
That's pretty amazing.

464
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,895
Well...

465
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,814
let's move on to our next stop.

466
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:27,069
The closet Patty Hearst
willfully hid herself in

467
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,275
before trotting on down...

468
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,485
[Montgomery]
What's good with that? What's going on?

469
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,790
[Jimmie] Feel like the King of England.
King Jimmie. Wave.

470
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,117
Wave to the General.

471
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,037
- Hey, General.
- Yeah, but it's like a circle

472
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,293
with your... with your elbow.

473
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,251
Yeah, and then cup the air.
That's "cup the air".

474
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,961
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, that's good.

475
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:16,290
[woman vocalizing]

476
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,169
[fire crackling]

477
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,629
It's a beautiful house, Jim.

478
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,222
More beautiful than I could have imagined.

479
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:39,814
Yeah.

480
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,395

806
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,670
I don't know.

807
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,218
[knocking on door]

808
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,259
What the fuck?

809
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,433
I invited somebody.

810
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,563
[Montgomery] What's good, nigga?
Glad you could make it.

811
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,274
What's goin' on?

812
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,535
Be back in a sec. Pardon me.

813
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,162
Y'all got an organ?

814
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,133
Columns and shit.

815
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,506
[chair creaking]

816
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,563
[muffled scraping]

817
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,483
[muffled thudding]

818
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,818
It's just y'all here?

819
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:09,740
[Jimmie] Yeah.

820
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,748
It just makes noises.

821
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,246
Oh, okay.

822
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,336
[chair creaking]

823
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,414
It's nice to see you in that chair.
I didn't know you'd pick that one.

824
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,499
Thanks a lot, bro.

825
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,004
Kinda awkward, but this place is cool.

826
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,057
Yeah.
Jimmie's been doing a lot to fix it up.

827
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,384
How'd y'all get this?

828
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:34,686
[Montgomery] It's Jimmie's.

829
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,021
His grandpa built it.

830
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,561
He was the first black man
in San Francisco.

831
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,938
That's what they call him anyways.

832
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,779
[Kofi] Oh, shit.

833
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,282
- This that house?
- Hmm.

834
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,655
Hey, Jimmie used to talk
about this spot all the time.

835
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,217
But you know how niggas be
in the group home.

836
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,083
Overexaggerating and shit.

837
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,212
Trying to be all special.

838
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,250
[scoffs] You weren't lying about
this one, though, huh, Jimmie?

839
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,048
You were in a group home?

840
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,052
Yeah.

841
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:14,725
For, like, a year.

842
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,063
[Kofi] Yep.

843
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,394
You guys wanna go for a schvitz?

844
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,985
A what?

845
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,419
Wait, your grandfather made this, too?

846
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,509
Nah. Nah, these white people did.

847
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,087
Uh-huh.

848
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,302
Well, how you know
he was the first one, though?

849
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,429
[scoffing] This nigga be lyin'.

850
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,136
[Jimmie] Bro, he came over here
from New Orleans.

851
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,479
There was hella Japanese people, bro.

852
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:04,101
And then they got thrown
into little war camps,

853
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,481
and he wasn't tryin' to move
into nobody else's shit.

854
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,188
So he built this, bro.

855
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,527
[scoffs] This is great.

856
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,282
You still skate, bro?

857
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,243
[Kofi] Nah.

858
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,533
No, I don't skate no more.

859
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,870
Oh, shit, I mean,
you used to be hella raw.

860
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,080
Yeah.

861
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,549
Not no more.

862
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,760
Hey, you remember Gunna?

863
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,213
Remember when he got caught
stealing from the candy lady?

864
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,301
[all laughing]

865
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,552
Yeah, he's an ugly-ass crier.

866
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,012
Oh, man.

867
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,390
Hurt as fuck!

868
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:48,027
Hey, remember, uh, Miss Homer,
the one that ran the group home?

869
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,900
- Oh, yeah!
- And she cut that nigga hair.

870
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,858
Had his line crooked hella much!

871
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,534
"Know damn well
that white lady couldn't cut no hair!"

872
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,453
[laughing]

873
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,122
Had that nigga's shit lookin'
like Lombard.

874
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,370
- [laughter continues]
- [coughing]

875
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,748
That nigga said Lomb... [coughs]

876
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,297
Ah, man, you niggas gonna
make me piss on myself.

877
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,591
Oh, shit, y'all got a bathroom
up in here, man?

878
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,090
- In this big-ass house?
- It's down the hall.

879
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,513
It's the room
with the little claw-foot tub.

880
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,092
All right.
This cool as shit, big-ass house.

881
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,886
Man...

882
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,389
I wish I had a grandpa like you.

883
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,440
Leave me some shit like this.

884
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,484
This shit's enjoyable.

885
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:30,107
Right on, bro.

886
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,189
I'm proud of you niggas. You too, Mont.

887
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,116
Crazy-ass.

888
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,036
- [coughs]
- Just living the life, man.

889
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,822
Y'all niggas really done made it, man.

890
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,292
Ah, shit, I'm gonna go use
this bathroom real quick.

891
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,370
You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie.

892
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,965
"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

893
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,981
You should, uh...

894
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,935
You should have your own room, bro.

895
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,991
[Montgomery] That's okay, Jim.

896
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,539
[Jimmie] Nah, seriously, man.

897
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,288
I been in your space forever.

898
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,628
This place is yours, too.

899
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,591
Any room?

900
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:41,008
[men's choir vocalizing]

901
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,777
[harmonizing]

902
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,659
How about this one?

903
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,964
[Jimmie]
Are you sure you want the dining room?

904
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,210
Yeah.

905
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:11,964
It's perfect.

906
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,172
Dream big, bro.

907
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,347
It's yours.

908
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,653
[Jimmie] Um, yeah, we're gonna
have to figure something out.

909
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,113
I don't have that much time.

910
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,908
It's a complicated situation.

911
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,158
No, the power's been on.
I just need the bill in my name.

912
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,584
Uh-huh.

913
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,997
Okay, great.
Well, when will I get the first invoice?

914
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,630
And you can't mail that any sooner?

915
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,302
All right, yeah.

916
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,808
[chuckles]

917
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,057
He's talking about paying some bills.

918
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,265
'Cause I wouldn't say no
if he offered to chip in a little more.

919
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,108
He already pays half, Grandpa.

920
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,984
Well, he's been here
for a while, you know?

921
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,024
And he is not exactly family.

922
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:24,945
I think he knows that.

923
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,116
[Grandpa] Let's hope so.

924
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,994
What's all this noise up in here?

925
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,224
[Montgomery] I'm just packing some stuff.

926
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,162
It's for a project.

927
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,502
Since when?

928
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,969
I mean, we haven't even talked
about the characters yet.

929
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,344
- You know how much I like that.
- Yeah, well, I'm still working on it.

930
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,054
Don't quite have a plot yet.

931
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:52,055
Well, we can brainstorm a little bit.

932
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,099
You know,
that's where I think we the best at.

933
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,525
When we brainstorming.

934
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:01,856
[Montgomery] I think I gotta brainstorm
this one by myself right now.

935
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,785
But I'd love to talk about it soon.

936
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:10,956
You about ready, bro?

937
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,420
[Montgomery] Mm-hmm.

938
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,130
[Grandpa] Well, um...

939
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,419
whatever it is, uh...

940
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:27,424
I'm proud of you.

941
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,556
- Wow, look at him.
- What type of shoes are those?

942
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,767
Yeah, you should start
rocking like that, bra-bra.

943
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,568
What the fuck is up with your hat, Jimmie?

944
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,987
You look like a human cigarette.
I can't handle it.

945
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:46,283
Jimmie, is that a bowling ball?
It's the black Alice in Wonderland.

946
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:50,409
Hey, Monty, I heard you be whippin' out
that little weenie on all the girls.

947
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,739
[laughing]

948
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,665
Bro, with that hair,
you look like a Simpson.

949
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,244
[man] Nigga, shut up, bro,
your one-shirt-havin' ass.

950
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,206
Jimmie, you wear the same shirt
every motherfuckin' day.

951
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,586
You look like a fiend, Jimmie. Come on!

952
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,009
- Hey, just like your daddy!
- [all exclaim]

953
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,384
I remember your crackhead-ass daddy.

954
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,340
And your dope-fiend-ass mom.

955
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,892
[man] Family of fiends, dawg.

956
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,265
[Kofi] I done sold him a rock
back in the day.

957
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,597
Hey, what you got up in there?

958
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,932
Some lace curtains for that whole
beautifyin'-ass house

959
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:19,858
that y'all been makin' up and shit?

960
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,562
Okay, Kofi! Okay, what else?

961
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,634
These niggas the other day,
they pulled up the other day.

962
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:28,151
Niggas had all types of feminine shit
goin' on in that house, bro.

963
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,827
Jimmie, what two men do that?

964
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:33,281
Just 'cause you in that big-ass house,

965
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,583
- Never.
- You're not better than us.

966
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:38,349
Hey, what is those, lace curtains
you gonna beautify the house with?

967
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,879
Come on, man, soft-ass nigga.

968
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,674
I know who you is, Jimmie. Remember!

969
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,613
Hey, you know what y'all need to do?

970
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:48,175
Y'all need to disappear
like a motherfuckin' magic trick, nigga!

971
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,758
Rabbit out the hat. Get the fuck out here.
Fuck outta here!

972
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,717
[men continue jeering]

973
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,557
Jimmie! Jimmie! Go home!

974
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,523
[sighs]

975
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,448
You're really drawing them?

976
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,580
They just talk shit.

977
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,539
Well, you talked shit when I met you.

978
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,548
I did?

979
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,383
You did.

980
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,011
It's fine, though.

981
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,264
Why'd you hang out with me, then?

982
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,810
You care about things. I liked you.

983
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,783
You really don't give a fuck
what anybody says?

984
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:57,073
I shouldn't get to appreciate them
'cause they're mean to me?

985
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,911
That's silly. [chuckles]

986
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:33,659

[sighs]

994
01:05:58,705 --> 01:05:59,866
What are you doing here?

995
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,787
What are you ever doing here?

996
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,248
[Jimmie] Uh...

997
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,796

998
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,217
Yeah.

999
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,344
They changed the fuckin' locks on me.

1000
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,635
I'm sorry. That sucks.

1001
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,814
What do you want, man?

1002
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:31,561
How long you gonna be here?

1003
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:35,652
I don't know yet. I'm just tryin' to...

1004
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:38,950
let go.

1005
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,703
Okay, well...

1006
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,957
I guess we'll just

1007
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,247
[Mary] Great.

1008

That's nice. [chuckles]

1009
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,632
[Montgomery] Come on, Jim.
We'll go to my house.

1010
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,304
[Mary] In this crazy fuckin' city,
you're still here.

1011

[scoffs]

1012

Man, those damn kids

1013
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,189
It'll get all over your seat, man.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1014
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,114
[man continues speaking indistinctly]

1015
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,692
Think she'll stay there all night?

1016
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,615
Watch, we'll come back
and she'll be painting the windowsill.

I've been clean for three years.
I know where those meetings are.

All right, you got it.

Oh, no, we been back for three months now.

Oh, hi. Excuse me, I'm Jimmie's mom.

Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

The house, my dad's old house.

Well, I just have to come over there,

[Grandpa] <i>That poor boy and his friends.</i>

1098
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,590
[sighs] I'm sorry, Jimmie.

1099
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,755
I hope I never made you feel like
you weren't welcome here.

1100
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,934
No, I... I never felt like that.

1101
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,770
'Cause I don't care where you been.

1102
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,860
You don't have to tell me.

1103
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:53,777
It's just, you two... stick together.

1104
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,126
You know, I was writing a play about him.

1105
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,888
You don't have to stop now.

1106
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,358
"You a funny motherfucker, Jimmie."

1107
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:31,939
[chuckles softly]

1108
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,829
I know it sounds weird, but...

1109
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,371
I kinda feel like that could've been me.

1110
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,665
If not for the house.

1111
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,686
Man, I wanna go home.

1112
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,160
[preacher] Filthy, fishy salt water.

<i>They've got plans for us.</i>

1116
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,892
We was made to be put through hell.

1117
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:46,396
Purified. We was made
to be put through hell.

1118
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:49,725
Be purified.

1119
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:03,704
Fuck!

1120
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,287
Oh, God.

1121
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:10,336
[Jimmie] Fuck!

1122
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,638
How did she toss all of our shit?

1123
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,174
[Montgomery] I don't think it was her.

Yeah, where you going?

- Where you going?
- I'll be back.

- I want to buy a house.
- A house?

That's exciting.

No. Do I need to?

No.

01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:51,305
Not necessarily. Um...
do you have a price range in mind?

1143
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,764
I have a house in mind.

1144

Oh.

Um...

How much are they asking?

1148
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,525
At least four million.

1149

Uh, and how much
are you willing to put down?

1150

How much is usual?

1151
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,746
Well, typically, we'd be looking
to secure at least 20%.

That's understandable.

It's going to be hard
to land a place like that.

01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,894
But suppose I ask instead, uh...

I'm young. Uh, I'm black.

I'm not rich.

I came here knowing all that.

But let's be real.
You also got a quota to meet.

- Now, I'm not calling you a predator.
- Sir.

But you're trying to make your money.

- So let me help you do that.
- Sir, that's not the way this works.

You can give me whatever deal you
gotta give me. I don't care what it is.

'Cause unlike all the other people

So I'll never miss a monthly bill, ever.

You can give me

You can give me your highest

- Fine, sir.

I noticed the house we discussed
is now for sale.

1183
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,624
There are some alarming elements
in your literature

1184
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,184
I thought you would like to know.

1185
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,575
And certainly the Bureau
of Real Estate would.

1186
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,319
Uh-huh.

1187
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:06,440
This claims the property has a view
of the Golden Gate.

1188
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:09,116
Which... I don't think is true.

1189
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,620
Well, it isn't. It isn't true.

1190
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:16,450
It also claims to have all the original
fixtures, floors, and faucets.

1191
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:17,829
Isn't true.

1192
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,400
And are you planning on disclosing
that there's no septic tank?

1193
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,290
Which means, any day now,

1194
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,923
the garden could be flooded... with shit.

1195

Well...

1197
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:37,016
all this together seems
like false advertisement.

1198
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,272
Which is grounds for void of sale.

1199

Potential revoke of license.

What's your deal, man?

1202

Don't have a deal.

gotten that house if it wasn't me.

And fixtures?

the history of the house.

than it actually was.
