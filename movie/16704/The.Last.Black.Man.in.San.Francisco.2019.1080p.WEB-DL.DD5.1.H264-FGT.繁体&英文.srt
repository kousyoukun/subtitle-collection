Jasmine?

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,250
賈絲敏  我們要遲到了  快過來
Jasmine! We gonna be late, come on.

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,410
我們走吧
Let's go.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,170
為什么他們有防護服穿  而我們沒有
Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,230
有些事正在我們面前發生
Something's going on right in our face.

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,400
你們卻天天盯著iPhone
You're so stuck on those iPhones,

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,800
Jphone 12s什么的
Jphone 12s or whatever,

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,640
那玩意兒能在你手里爆炸
blow up in your hand.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,850
你用谷歌可查不到正在發生的事情
You can't Google what's going on right now.

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,390
你們在聽嗎
Are y'all paying attention?

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,900
為什么他們有防護服穿  而我們沒有
Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,320
為什么啊
Why?

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,610
他們是來凈化這片水域的嗎
They here to clean this water?

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,240
這片水域已經又臟又臭五十年了
When this water been dirtier than the Devil's mouth for 50 years.

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,120
現在他們想起來清理了
And now they want to clean it?

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,870
他們沒安好心  各位
They got plans for us, man.

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,890
就跟喬治·杰森被解雇一樣
Looking like George Jetson rejects.

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,890
{\an8}1962年美國動畫《杰森一家》中的人物  該動畫講述了住在未來的一家人的生活  故事中他的老板總是會以憤怒的方式解雇喬治  直到同一集結束時才再次聘用他

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,130
因為他們不行
'Cause they weak!

38
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,300
心臟不行
Weak hearts!

39
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,670
肺也不行
Weak lungs!

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,130
不戴個面具都不能在這里呼吸
Can't even breathe up here without a mask.

41
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,720
但我們為了得到凈化  經歷煉獄之苦
But we was put through hell to be purified.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
你們懂我在說什么嗎  兄弟姐妹們
You know what I'm sayin', brothers and sisters?

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,060
老天  看看監獄把黑人折磨成什么樣了
Man, it's crazy what jail will do to a nigga.

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,370
他們根本就不在乎這片水域
They don't care about their water, man,

45
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,460
這事有隱情
there's something going on,

46
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,320
我們必須追根究底
we gonna get to the bottom of it.

47
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,050
算他們走運  我如今是上帝的子民
And they lucky I'm a man of God right now.

48
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,010
你覺得他每天早上都會排練這段話嗎
You think he rehearses this every morning?

49
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,160
否則我會給他們好看
Or they would catch these hands.

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,870
感覺即興的成分更多
Seems a bit more impromptu.

51
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,760
2019年了
2019 out here!

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,390
我們為這里的污水問題奔走的時候
We been yellin' about this water

53
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,170
他們還沒出生呢
since before they were born.

54
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,250
那時候他們還沒出生呢
Before they were born!

55
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,050
公交車怎么還不來  我們來不及了
Where's this bus, man? We're not gonna make it.

56
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,390
你們離我們遠點
Y'all leave us the hell alone.

57
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,800
除非你們真的是來幫我們的
Unless y'all really here to help us.

58
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,060
我們會到的
We'll get there.

59
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,280
他們另有目的  各位
They got plans for us, man.

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,410
我們來不及了  兄弟
We're not gonna make it, bro.

61
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,790
但是對你我沒有好處
Not for you and me.

62
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,200
所以我勸諸位啊
So I urge you!

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,940
為你們的土地抗爭
Fight for your land!

64
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,690
為你們的家園抗爭
Fight for your home!

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,240
-為你們的...  -我們滑滑板吧
- Fight for your... - Let's skate.

66
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,960
這里
This here?

67
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,880
這里就是邊境了  兄弟
This is the edge, bro!

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,420
命定擴張論的最后邊疆
The final frontier of Manifest Destiny.

69
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,420
{\an8}19世紀美國人的一種信條
認為對外擴張是美國的天命

70
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,840
城市的最后界限
Last edge of the city.

71
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,530
兄弟  再走兩步
Man, two steps further,

72
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,180
你就要去喝那骯臟的咸水了
you'll be drinking that filthy saltwater.

73
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,730
但我們造了這些船
But we built these ships.

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,770
疏浚了這些運河
Dredged these canals.

75
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,820
在舊金山這塊他們從不知道存在的土地上
In the San Francisco they never knew existed.

76
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,500
現在他們才來造點新東西是吧
And now they come to build something new?

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,090
整個街區一半落后  一半先進
Whole blocks half in the past, half in the future.

78
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,680
但如果你闖入他們的舊金山
But should you venture into their San Francisco,

79
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,010
被他們掠奪黃金的地方
the one they pillaged for gold!

80
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,260
在那座虛偽之城
Remember your truth!

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,680
堅守你的真理
In the city of facades.

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,940
帶上我
Take me with you!

83
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,360
帶上我  伙計
Take me with you, man!

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,990
拜托  我們要去哪
Come on, where are we going?

85
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,410
我們要去哪
Where are we going?

86
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,330
來吧  我來了  我來了
Come on, I'm coming! I'm coming!

87
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,800
看看他們看你的樣子
Look at them look at you.

88
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,380
居高臨下  不屑一顧
Look down at you.

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,760
但這些房子都是我們造的
But we built them!

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,470
我們就是這些房子
We are these homes!

91
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,810
他們的眼睛
Their eyes...

92
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,310
他們的尖頂
Their pointed brims...

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,980
他們搬家  我們也要搬家
We move if they move.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,360
每一塊木頭都浸著我們的汗水
Our sweat soaked in the wood.

95
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,160
以我們的意象鍍了金
Gilded in our image.

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,540
這是我們的家
This is our home!

97
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,460
我們的家
Our home!

98
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,170
我們的家
Our home.

99
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,760
謝了
Thanks.

100
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,850
你確定他們走了嗎
Are you sure they're gone?

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,780
吉姆
Jim?

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
他們的車不在了
I mean, their car is gone.

103
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,500
我們去后門看看  兄弟
Let's check the back, man.

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,760
早上好
Good morning.

105
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,830
你們好嗎
How are you?

106
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,550
還記得他們在廚房那次嗎
Remember that time they were in the kitchen?

107
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,800
吉姆
Jim!

108
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,430
還記得廚房那次嗎
Remember the kitchen?

109
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,970
當然記得
Yeah, sure.

110
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,760
但是兄弟...
But, bro...

111
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,390
我不是說過這些欄桿是藍紫色嗎  不是黑色
Didn't I tell you these railings are periwinkle, not black.

112
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,650
嗯  知道了
Yeah, I got it.

113
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,530
我們不能再兩周來一次了  得更勤點
We gotta start coming more than every two weeks, bro.

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,040
這破花園簡直一團糟
This fuckin' garden's a nightmare.

115
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,460
下次來我可以帶上我爺爺的工具
I'll bring my grandpa's tools next time.

116
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,040
你千萬得帶上
Please do.

117
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,850
墻紙在剝落
Wallpaper's chipping.

118
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,930
這房子要被他們毀了
These people are killing this house.

119
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,910
但你不能進去
You're not goin' in though.

120
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,850
吉姆
Jim?

121
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,230
我覺得...
I mean...

122
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,070
我覺得...
I mean...

123
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,400
不進去了
No?

124
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,780
但他們肯定走了
They're definitely gone, though.

125
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,030
這次最好動作快點
Better be quick this time.

126
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,080
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

127
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,750
這事兒快不了
Takes time.

128
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,710
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

129
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,540
我去老地方
I'll be at my spot.

130
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,130
好
All right.

131
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,630
快點
Quick.

132
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,170
行
Okay.

133
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,680
-老天爺  -親愛的
- Jesus, man! - Honey.

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,350
你快給我下來
Just get the heck out of here, man.

135
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,100
-什么鬼  -他又沒傷人  梅爾
- What the fuck? - He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

136
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,560
現在他又漆上房子了
He's painting the house now?

137
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
是啊
Well, yeah.

138
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,420
別再修繕我的房子了
Stop fixing my house!

139
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,260
我都快弄好了  再等等
I'm almost done, just hold on.

140
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,650
你怎么不去漆鄰居家的房子
Why don't you just paint the neighbors' houses?

141
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,050
他們家比我們家還破
Theirs are worse than ours.

142
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,780
再等一會兒就好
Just hold on one second.

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,220
在某種程度上
I mean, we appreciate it,

144
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,030
我們是很感謝你
in some way, but, yeah...

145
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,330
但你這樣很奇怪  小伙子
It's weird, man!

146
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,650
我都快弄完了
I'm almost done.

147
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,290
我們會報警的  小伙子
Look, we will call the cops, man.

148
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,580
這次我是認真的
And I mean it this time.

不  我們不會報警的

We're not calling the cops, just stop coming back.

152
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,040
從我的鳥池上下來

-別啊...  -下來  小伙子

154
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,000
-三塊錢的菜啊  -好吧
- Those were $3. - Fine.

155
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,890
那我下次再來弄完

156
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,230

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,090
記得給后院的植物澆水  不然我來澆
Just water the plants in the back or I will.

160
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,140
兄弟  你本該負責把風的
Bro! You were supposed to be the lookout!

161
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,680
明明是你一直在擔心
You were the one that was so worried.

162
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,140
我分心了

163
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,730
兄弟

如果政府是對的怎么辦
What if OG is right though?

165
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,940
你真的不能再吃這里的魚了
You really gotta stop eating the fish out there.

166
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,440
我覺得沒事
I think it's fine.

167
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,320
哪條魚里還沒點汞
All fish has mercury.

168
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,160
我知道  但我看見過一只有老二的海鷗
I know, but I saw a seagull with a dick, bro.

169
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,700
那我猜那是只雄鳥
Well, so I guess it's a male.

170
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,620
不  兄弟  我是說像人類的老二
No, like, bro, like a human dick.

- Ain't tryin' do nothin'. - Scuff my shoes up, huh?

174
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,170
我沒想過要做那破事...
I ain't tryin' do that bullshit...

175
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,310
{\an8}別耍把戲了  當心我把你的臉打爛
Stop playin' before I slap the shit out your face.

176
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,920
閉上你的臭嘴吧  伙計
Man, shut your ass up, nigga.

177
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,530
行了  我才不要追你  你玩得太過了
All right, I ain't finna chase you, you play too much, bro.

178
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,820
我沒揍你一頓算你走運  兄弟
You lucky I don't beat your ass out here, bro.

179
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,070
科菲
Kofi!

180
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,780
-最近如何  兄弟  -你們怎么樣
- What's good, brother? - What's up with y'all?

181
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,100
我昨晚看見媽媽她們了
You know I seen Moms last night, right?

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
她看起來頭有點禿了
She was looking like she was missing a little bit on the top.

183
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,770
我們可都用一樣的水洗澡  吉姆
I mean we shower in the same water, Jim.

184
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,870
所以現在伙計們都一起洗澡了
So niggas takin' showers together now?

185

有點基
That's fruity.

187
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,100
我是在勸他別吃魚了
I was trying to tell him not to eat the fish,

188
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,730
因為水有毒
because the water is toxic.

189
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,800
那是因為他們就在那兒造的原子彈  老兄
That's 'cause they built the atomic bomb right there, nigga.

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,020
我覺得那不是真的
I don't think that's true.

191
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,020
他說什么
What'd he say?

192
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,790
見鬼  首先  那肯定是真的

兄弟  你的鞋才不是真的呢

I know your Jesus-lookin' ass ain't talkin', bro.

- Them things is phony. - They're definitely phony.

196
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,340
親戚怎么樣  伙計
What about cuz, man?

197
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,550
你說好昨晚打電話給我的

198
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,550
-發生了什么...  -這家伙很不靠譜
- What happened with... - Oh, yeah, dude is a cat.

You see his hair, he might be a cheetah.

How do I get their old croissant-throwing asses out of the house?

226
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,080
要是我在他們桌子上撒尿呢
What if I peed on their table?

227
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,340
如果我爬到鳥池上
Like, what if I climbed up the birdie bath,

228
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,300
闖進去  然后在他們的黃色小桌子上撒尿呢

你今天早上有寫點什么嗎

262
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,770
寫作就是重寫

這是整個過程的一部分

你對我來說太年輕了

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,180
閉嘴吧  孬種
Shut up, bitch, bro.

288
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,060
你個孬種  聽好了
You bitch. Hold this shit.

289
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
我就該扯爛你的臟辮
I should snatch your one-ass dread,

290
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,230
你他媽看起來就像拉斯塔法里教徒
lookin' like a fuckin' Rastafarian sperm.

291
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,380
你們煩死了
You got me fucked up.

292

我們煩死了  沒錯
We got you fucked up! We did!

293
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
你就打算說這個
That's all you gotta say?

294
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,510
伙計  那我該怎么做  掉頭就走
Man, what I'm supposed to do, take off?

295
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,720
我對這些一點都不在乎
I don't care about none of that shit.

296
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,430
我知道  但我沒有別的話要說了
I know, I just ain't got nothin' else to say.

297
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,310
說句實話  這個家伙就是個孬種
Man, I put that on a fact, that this nigga's a bitch, man.

298
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,040
說得對  兄弟  讓他去死吧
Is that sure, man. Man, fuck this nigga.

299
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,750
怎么樣  兄弟

302
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
你好嗎  兄弟
How are you, nigga?

303
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,890
我希望她不在家
I hope she's not home.

304
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,390
那個花園
That garden...

305
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,690
我們要干的事太多了
We have so much to do.

306
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,540
我們得犁地
We have to rake it.

307

我們得除草
We have to weed it.

308

-我們得...  -吉姆

309
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,780
那不是你以前住的車嗎
Isn't that the car you used to live in?

310
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,710
天啊
Oh, God.

311
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,780
吉米

你好嗎  臭烘烘的混蛋東西

Do you need a ride?

314
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,590
吉米

315
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,430
發生什么事了  寶貝
What's happenin', baby?

316
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,760
未老先衰的混蛋  快上車
Get your young, old-looking ass in the car.

317
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,310
長臉驢

318
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,660
吉米
Jimmie!

319
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,870
天啊  公交車怎么還沒來
Oh, my God, where is this bus?

320
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,330
你這個穿襯衫的老混蛋
Man, if you don't get your up

321
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,770
要是還不快點滾到車上來
the father from Good Times shirt-wearing ass in this car...

322
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,710
你真的要拿著鏟子坐公交車嗎
You really gonna ride in the bus with a shovel?

323
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,030
農夫小子  快點上車
Get your farming ass in this car.

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,950
農夫吉米  你個混蛋
Jimmie the farmer with your bitch ass.

325
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,080
拜托  笑一下嘛  吉米
Come on, laugh a little bit, Jimmie, shit.

326
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,130
還是老樣子
Still the same.

327
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,340
是的  我喜歡你跟你爸的杰作
Yep, I like what you and your dad did with it.

328
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,760
喜歡到你直接把它開走了
So much you drove off with it?

329
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,940
不  我是借的  我沒有...
No, I borrowed it, I didn't, just, come on...

330
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,720
我把它開走了  靠  我借的
I drove off with it... I borrowed it, shit.

331
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,720
其實  我前兩天還見了你爸
Matter of fact, I seen your dad the other day.

332
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,600
他一人過得挺好
He was good and lonely.

333
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,060
孤身一人
By hisself.

334
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,690
好吧
Okay.

335
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,250
我跟他說  你得養只貓或狗
I told him you need to get you a cat or a dog,

336
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,190
或者找個女人之類的
or woman or something, nigga, damn.

337
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,460
他獨自在家
He's home alone...

338
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,030
那不是他家  但他孤身一人
Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

339
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,620
他孤身一人  還沒有家
He's alone with no home.

340
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,910
你也是自己一個人  住在車里
Well, you live in a car by yourself.

341
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,290
是住車里  但我不孤獨
Yeah, but I... But I'm not alone.

342
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,290
大家都喜歡我
People like me.

343
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,300
我很受歡迎
I'm liked.

344
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,300
孤獨的兄弟
Lonely ass nigga.

345
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,680
你上一次見你爸是什么時候
When the last time you hung out with your daddy?

346
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,310
幾周前  說不清
Couple weeks ago, I dunno.

347
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,690
幾周前  他現在就需要你
Couple weeks ago? The nigga needs you today.

348
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,820
靠
Shit.

349
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,000
養兒防老  這就是大家生孩子的原因
That's what... That's what people have kids for,

350
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,740
這樣他們就能有人陪伴
so they can have some companionship!

351
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,320
有人一起玩
Somebody to hang out with.

352
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,370
這就是我不要孩子的原因
That's why I ain't had no kids.

353
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,200
因為我不想被打擾
'Cause I don't wanna be bothered.

354
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,210
你爸不想要這輛破車  伙計
Your daddy don't want this fuckin' car, man.

355
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,460
這不是薩沃伊公寓嗎
Wasn't that the Savoy House?

356
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,380
曾經是
Sure was.

357
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,010
這里以前住了上百個人  廉租房
It was 100 motherfuckers in there, rent-controlled.

358
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,840
他們以為這地方是他們的
They thought they owned that shit.

359
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,430
房東把那些人全都趕走了
The landlord burned all of the people outta there.

360
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,520
因為你看  吉米
'Cause see, Jimmie,

361
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,640
你其實一無所有
you never really own shit.

362
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,480
這車不屬于我
This car ain't mine.

363
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,360
但是也從來不屬于你
But it never was yours.

364
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,240
你一無所有
You never own shit!

365
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,090
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?

366
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,610
發生什么了  伙計
What's goin' on, man?

367
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,060
不知道  兄弟
No se, bro.

368
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,340
先生
Sir...

369
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,000
發生什么了
What's... What's going on?

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,480
天吶
Oh, God.

371
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,400
她要搬走了
She's moving.

372
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,690
跟她妹妹爭得死去活來
Fighting like crazy with her sister.

373
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,790
家里有人去世后
When someone dies in the family,

374
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,610
白人總是這樣
that's what white people do.

375
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,240
這是她的  這是他的  這是我的
This is for her, this is for him, this is mine.

376
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,200
這房子該歸誰
Who's gonna have the house?

377
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,040
他們失去房子了
So they lost the house?

378
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,660
房子現在歸誰名下
Who's gonna possess the house?

379
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,310
他們只是吵架  不停爭斗
They're just fighting, and fighting, and fighting.

380
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,540
現在會發生什么
What's gonna happen to it now?

381
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,000
為什么她媽媽死了  他們就得搬出去
Why'd they have to move out 'cause her mom died?

382
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,310
我不知道
I don't know.

383
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,590
他們毫無品味
They were tasteless,

384
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,720
但是至少他們沒把房子毀了
but at least they didn't fuck it up.

385
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,620
總共十美元  親
Well, that will be $10, hun.

386
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,660
怎么這么貴
Since when?

387
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,730
六十塊特趣巧克力  這是最劃算價格了
Since that's the best deal you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

388
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,860
我沒有說要六十塊  我說要十六塊
I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie. I said 16.

389
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,040
我怎么吃得了六十塊
How I'm gonna eat 60 Twix?

390
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,490
我哪知道你有什么毛病
I don't know your life.

391
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,610
你以為你這是好又多那種批發超市嗎
You act like you in Costco or something like that.

392
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,040
你這可不是好又多
You ain't Costco.

393
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,350
要是想去好又多  那你就去啊
You can go to Costco if you need to.

394
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,060
-你個傻逼  -現在就去啊
- You Rosco. - Go right now.

395
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,340

399
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,920
兩位先生
So, gentlemen.

400
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,590
有什么可以幫到你們的
What can I do for you?

401
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,980
我們想打聽一棟房子
Yeah, we're curious about a house

402
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,050
位于金門大橋附近  菲爾莫爾街

那棟房子非常特別
that place is very special.

412
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,130
我以前每天上學都會開車經過那棟房子
I used to drive past that house on the way to school every day.

413
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,750

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,900
但是  那房子在出售嗎  我沒聽說
But, so, it's for sale? I didn't hear about that.

426
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,970
我不確定
Well, I'm not sure.

427
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,760
好像房主和她的妹妹
It seems like the owner and her sister

428

伙計
Man.

431
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,410
我不好說  這聽起來像是遺產的事
I don't know, that sounds like an estate thing.

432
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,640
情況有些復雜
That's a sucky situation.

433
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,980
但是
But, I mean...

434
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,290
這樣的房子

435

436
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,460
但房子就空置著

437
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
真可惜
It's a pity.

438
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,340
所以它真的就...就那么空置著嗎
So it's really just... just empty?

439
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,970
很扯對吧
It's fucked up, right?

440
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,520
太扯了  就像我...
So fucked up, like I...

然后這些又大又老的房子

443
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,880
就那么空置著積灰

但你還能說什么

00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,200
因為我可不想再看他把你拖下水
'Cause I hope he's done dragging you into his schemes.

566
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,900
姑姑  這是為了我們
Auntie, this is for us.

567
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,190
好吧

569
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,200

我很懷念那座城市
I miss that city.

572
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,490
不過你看起來還是很性感  寶貝
You still look good though, baby.

573
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,210
你看起來還是很性感
You still look good!

574
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,180
我真受不了
Oh, my goodness.

575
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,700
見鬼  我知道你有一些  結果全都在你這嗎
Damn, I knew you had some of it, but is this everything?

576
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,360
除了被你爸吸毒變賣的之外  都在這了
Everything your dad didn't smoke up.

577
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,640
不好意思  玩笑開得有點重
Sorry, came out a little harsh.

578
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,040
沒關系
I'm fine.

579
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,620
你真的全都保留下來了
You really got all of this.

580
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,330

00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,580
打開那個
Open that.

583
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,010
這太棒了
That's amazing.

584
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,820
我知道
Yeah, I knew that,

585
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,390
這個家族里的所有人之中
out of everybody in this family,

586
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,930
只有你會來找這些東西
you would be the one that come looking for this stuff.

587
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,630
那么
So...

588
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,830
我可以
I can...

589
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,330
全部拿走嗎
Everything?

590

-謝謝  -是啊
- Thank you. - Hell, yeah.

592
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,030
瑞奇  把卡車開過來
Ricky, get the truck!

593
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,040
你們倆在后面還好嗎
You guys good back there?

594
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,180

謝謝
Thank you.

596
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,250
所以瑞奇從沒在這房子里住過
So, Ricky never lived in the house?

597
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,590
沒有  我們失去這棟房子的時候
No, Wanda didn't meet him

598
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,700
旺達還不認識他
until after we lost it.

599
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,070
-你好  先生  -你好
- Hello, sir. - Hey!

600

I'm Jimmie Fails, we haven't had the chance to meet yet.

601
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,500
-是的  -是的

605
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,270
我叫蒂姆  蒂姆·艾洛瑞

606
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,850

Sure, sure, nice to meet you, man.

607
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,690
現在房子賣得太快了
It's a fast-moving market,

608
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,700
我都不記得這里豎過牌子
I don't even remember a sign going up.

609
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,330
沒必要豎牌子  但...
It didn't need to, but...

610
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,910
聽著  蒂姆  我想告訴你
Look, Tim, I want you to know

611
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,370
你絕對沒見過比我更好的鄰居
I'm going to be the best damn neighbor you ever had.

612
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,950
好...
Well...

613
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,900

- All right, Jimmie, thank you. - My pleasure.

614
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,930
抱歉  我先失陪了
Well, you'll have to pardon me,

615
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,640
我們還有很多事要做  但...
we've got lots to do, but...

616
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,660
-當然  好的  -認識你很高興  嗯
- Of course, oh, yeah. - Very nice to meet you, yeah.

617
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,240
這到底是怎么回事
What the fuck was that all about?

618
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,020
我想一邊喝咖啡
I wanna drink my coffee

619
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,360
一邊看報紙一邊撓屁股
and scratch my ass while I read the paper.

620
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,960
你從不看報紙  吉米
You don't read the paper, Jimmie.

621
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,880
那是因為我沒有一個可以在里面看報紙的家
'Cause I never had a home to read it in.

622
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,810
見鬼
Shit.

623
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,150
我們可以開派對
We could throw parties.

624
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
上演你的話劇
You could put on one of your plays.

625
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,060
大喊大叫
We could yell.

626
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,700
-注意鄰居  吉米  -鄰居
- The neighbors, Jimmie. - Oh, the neighbors?

627
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,620
我現在有鄰居了
I got neighbors now.

628
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,900
好樣的
Attaboy.

629
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,460
這兄弟是個孬種
This nigga is a bitch.

630
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,600
我就是有點害怕  假裝逃跑
I'm a soft nigga. Run the fake, nigga!

631
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,940
每次都這樣  兄弟
On everything, bro.

632
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,980
伙計  這小子是個慫包
Man, this kid was a straight sucker.

633
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,000
你騙人  兄弟

- Tell him what happened. - I swear to God.

636
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,370
昨天晚上  一輛白色面包車停在路邊
Man, last night, a white van pulled up.

637
00:41:59,370 --> 00:41:59,710
我對天發誓  兄弟
I swear to God, bro.

638
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,300
科菲像個慫包似的直接逃了
This nigga Kofi ran like a straight bitch!

639
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,290
-他沒騙你  -他會害死我們的
- He not lyin'! - He gonna get us killed!

640
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,340
你們說我跑了  我沒跑  兄弟
You niggas sayin' I ran? I didn't run, nigga!

641
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,050
伙計  你他媽在說什么
Man, fuck what you niggas talkin' about.

642
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,580

Shut the fuck up, bro, he's a straight sucker, bro.

643
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,290
伙計  他這樣讓別人覺得我們都是孬種
Man, he got us looking like bitches, bro.

644
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,290
如果讓我說
If I've gotta get on this thing,

645
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,380
我就會質問你
I'm gonna be questioning you!

646
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,410
你是我表兄啊

{\an8}《愛國者》

705
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,970
"像個舊金山娘炮似的"
like a Frisco fruit cup."

706
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,360
我知道他爸氣瘋了
I know his daddy mad as hell.

707
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,300
你還玩滑板嗎
You still skateboarding?

708
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,480
不玩了
Nah.

709
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,380
怎么了
What?

710
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,620
過來  幫我把這些剪了
Come here, help me cut these out.

711
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,710
確保壓著線剪
And make sure the color bleeds all the way through,

712
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,290
別留白邊  懂嗎
no white edges, aight?

713
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,800
是  長官  和以前一樣
Yes, sir. Same as always.

714
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,380
沒錯
Yeah.

715
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,820
和以前一樣
Same as always.

716
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,270
你記得我們偷住過的那個倉庫嗎
you remember that, warehouse we squatted at?

717
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,100
在我們離開埃爾多拉多之后
After we lived in the El Dorado?

718
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,420
我們沒交稅所以失去了那棟房子  對嗎
We lost that ' cause we didn't pay taxes, right?

719
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,340
當然不是
Hell, nah.

720
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,990
我交的稅可不少了
I paid our fair share of tax on that.

721
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,620
但誰在乎  通風管老化的蟑螂窩
But who cares, old drafty-ass roach nest.

722
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,100
破地方  但只有那里可以住
Shit, it was that,

723
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,160
否則就只能帶著你睡大街了
or sleeping on the street with your little ass.

724
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,830
爸  我很知足
Well, I appreciate it, Dad.

725
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,610
那如果我現住的房子
So, say I'm at a place now

726
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,330
房主離開了
and the owners left it,

727
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,630
我會給這棟房子交稅
I'm gonna pay taxes on it...

728
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,610
而且以你的名義付煤氣和電費
And you put gas and electric in your name?

729
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,230
對  我接下來就去辦  你知道我會的
Right, I'm gonna do that next, you know I know.

730
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,650
行  學你老爸
Okay, doin' it like your old man.

731
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,370
不錯啊
That's good.

732
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,010
沒人會來看這棟房子嗎
And nobody's come to check on it?

733
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,550
沒有  是棟空房子
Nope. It's empty.

734
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,520
好啊
Good.

735
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,040
這能爭取些時間
That buys you time.

736
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,630
他們已經離開三年了嗎
And they been gone three years?

737
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,290
沒有  最近剛走
Nah, just recently.

738
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,780
等等  什么
Wait, what?

739
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,950
他們還住在里面你就開始修繕了
You were workin' on it while they were still in it?

740
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,160
對
Yeah.

741
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,670
這房子在哪里
Where is this house?

742
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,370
就是菲爾莫爾街上那棟房子
It's the house in Fillmore.

743
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,010
什么房子
What house?

744
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,150
我們的老房子
Our old house.

745
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,150
你他媽什么意思  我們的老房子
What the fuck you mean, our old house?

746
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,010
你去看過那棟房子嗎
Have you seen that house?

747
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,020
看過  我是說
Well, yeah, I mean,

748
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,580
我經常去
I be over there all the time.

749
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,930
那你應該知道那不是你的老房子
Then you know that's not your old house

750
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,920
那里也不是你的黑人社區
and that's not your black-ass neighborhood.

751
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,340
目無尊長滿嘴胡話的小兔崽子
Little disrespectful lyin' ass.

752
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,580
-你在說什么  -我知道你還在玩滑板
- What are you talking about? - Nigga, I know you skateboard!

753
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,030
是的
Yeah.

754
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,430
我看到你在外面干什么了
Yeah, I see all that shit out there.

755
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,770
每個人的道路
Everybody's little path.

756
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,480
我也就比你們領先三十步吧
I'm like 30 steps ahead of y'all.

757
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:04,230
走吧
Go on.

758
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,830
滾
Get!

759
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,980
你知道我們再也不提那棟房子了
You know we don't talk about that house no more.

760
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,090
把東西放下滾吧
Put the shit down and go!

761
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,380
你在這兒等很久了嗎
You been waiting here long?

762
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,000
很久了  兄弟
Hella long, bro.

763
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,550
我可能直接滑滑板了
I might just skate.

764
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,010
那也不錯
Well, that's nice.

765
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,130
這家伙瘋了
This guy fucks.

766
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:28,730
桑迪普  桑迪普  兄弟  這家伙瘋了
Sundeep. Sundeep, bro, this guy fucks.

767
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,580

771
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,770
這家伙瘋了  這家伙瘋了
This guy fucks! This guy fucks!

772
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,860
這城市就這德行
this city.

773
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,130
我早明白了  兄弟
I already know, bro.

774
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,580
操
Fuck!

775
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,360
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

776
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,100
沒事
Yeah.

777
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,190
沒事
Yeah.

778
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,550
這是什么
What is all this?

779
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,930
以前我爸做自己的事時
A little room I used to come in

780
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,500
我就待在這個小房間里
when my dad was doing his thing.

781
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,620
很酷  對嗎
It's cool, right?

782
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,380
對  哥們
Yeah, man.

783
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,170
你今天去見他了嗎
Did you see him today?

784
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,770
聊得怎樣
How'd it go?

785
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,480
他說這是個壞主意
He said this was a bad idea.

786
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,420
你不是說他就是個蠢貨嗎
Thought you said he was an idiot.

787
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,530
不  他就是氣自己把房子弄沒了
Nah, he's just mad 'cause he lost the house.

788
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,490
但是如果我們不該來這呢
But what if we shouldn't be here?

789
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,580
那還輪得到誰來
Who should be here more?

790
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,020
某個百萬富翁
Some millionaire?

791
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,920
他們喜歡這里只是因為這棟房子好看
They'd want it 'cause it looks nice.

792
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,860
因為你這房子才能完美如初  吉姆
You're the reason it looks nice, Jim.

793
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,260
這可說不好
I don't know.

794
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,060
搞什么
What the fuck?

795
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,430
我請了人過來
I invited somebody.

796
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,070
怎么樣  兄弟
What's good, nigga?

797
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,670
真高興你能過來
Glad you could make it.

798
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,150
怎么回事
What's goin' on?

799
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,560
一會兒就過來  稍等
Be back in a sec, pardon me.

800
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,080
你們還有管風琴
Y'all got an organ?

801
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,110
還有立柱啥的
Columns and shit.

802
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,960
只有你們兩個人嗎
It's just y'all here?

803
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,780
對
Yeah.

804
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:13,700
老房子自己會響
It just makes noises.

805
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,200
好吧
Okay.

806
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,120
看你坐在這把椅子真不錯
It's nice to see you in that chair,

807
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,550
沒猜到你會挑這把
I didn't know you'd pick that one.

808
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,400
多謝  哥們
Thanks a lot, bro.

809
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,150
有點奇怪  不過這地方挺棒的
Kinda awkward, but this place is cool.

810
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,220
是啊
Yeah.

811
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,180
吉米做了很多修繕工作
Jimmie's been doing a lot to fix it up.

812
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,060
你們怎么搞到這棟房子的
How'd y'all get this?

813
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:34,620
是吉米的
It's Jimmie's.

814
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,070
他爺爺建的
His grandpa built it.

815
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,790
他是第一個來舊金山的黑人
He was the first black man in San Francisco.

816
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,880
反正別人都是這么說的
That's what they call him anyways.

817
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,100
我去
Shit.

818
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:47,580
就是這棟房子嗎
This that house?

819
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,580
吉米之前總說起這地方
Jimmie used to talk about this spot all the time.

820
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,430
但是你也知道教養院里的那些家伙
But you know how niggas be in the group home.

821
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,110
牛逼吹破天
Overexaggerating and shit.

822
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,320
顯得自己與眾不同
Trying to be all special.

823
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,480
但是這個地方不是你胡編出來的  吉米
You weren't lying about this one, though, h Jimmie?

824
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,010
你住過教養院
You were in a group home?

825
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,040
對
Yeah.

826
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,810
住了一年吧
For like a year.

827
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,010
對
Yep.

828
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,470
想去做個汗蒸嗎
You guys wanna go for a schvitz?

829
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,990
啥東西
A what?

830
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,550
等等  這也是你爺爺建的嗎
Wait, your grandfather made this too?

831
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,690
不  不  這是那些白人建的
Nah. Nah, these white people did.

832
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,450
但你怎么知道他是第一個來的
Well, how you know he was the first one, though?

833
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,370
肯定說謊嘍
Nigga be lyin'.

834
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:58,290
兄弟  他從新奧爾良過來
Bro, he came over here from New Orleans.

835
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:01,000
這里全都是日本人
There was hella Japanese people, bro.

836
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,360
后來他們全都被關進了集中營
And then they got thrown into little war camps

837
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,690
他不想住進別人的家里
and he wasn't tryin' to move into nobody else's shit,

838
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,330
所以他就建了這棟房子
so he built this, bro.

839
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,550
太屌了
This is great.

840
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,090
你還玩滑板嗎  兄弟
You still skate, bro?

841
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,210
不
Nah.

842
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,480
不  我不玩了
No, I don't skate no more.

843
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,920
靠  你以前可挺牛逼的
Shit, I mean, you used to be hella raw.

844
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,230
是啊
Yeah.

845
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,330
我不知道  我...

你還記得岡南嗎

847
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,380
他偷賣糖的女士的東西被抓了
Remember when he got caught stealing from the candy lady?

848
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,870
他哭起來太他媽難看了
Yeah, he's an ugly-ass crier, really.

849
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,210
天啊

他說  "操  那個白人女士就不會剪頭發"
He goin', "Damn, that white lady couldn't cut no hair!"

856
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,510
把那家伙的腦袋剪得像倫巴第大街似的
Had that nigga's shit lookin' like Lombard Street.

857
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,510

那家伙說倫巴...

In this big-ass house?

862
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:13,210
順著大廳走到頭
It's down the hall.

863
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,620
有爪足浴缸的那間
It's the room with the little claw-foot tub.

864
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,140

878
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,990
你應該給自己找個房間
You should have your own room, bro.

879
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:21,800
沒關系的  吉姆
That's okay, Jim.

880
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,440

885
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,650
你確定你要住在餐廳里嗎
Are you sure you want the dining room?

886
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,200
對

00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,650
我們得把這件事搞清楚
Yeah, we're gonna have to figure something out.

891
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:37,910
我沒有那么多的時間
I don't have that much time.

892
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,950
情況很復雜
It's a complicated situation.

893
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,140

Okay, great. Well, when will I get the first invoice?

895
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,610
你不能再快一點寄過來嗎
And you can't mail that any sooner?

896
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,830
他在說什么付賬單的事
He's talking about paying some bills.

897
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,430
他要是想多分擔一點我也不會拒絕
'Cause I wouldn't say no if he offered to chip in a little more.

898
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,060
他已經分攤一半了  爺爺
He already pays half, Grandpa.

899
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:19,120
他在這也住了一陣子了  對吧
Well, he's been here for a while, you know?

900
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,140
他又不是我們的家人
And he is not exactly family.

901
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,010
我想他應該知道
I think he knows that.

902
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,660
但愿如此
Let's hope so.

903
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,000
你叮叮咣咣地在干什么
What's all this noise up in here?

904
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,180
我在收拾東西
I'm just packing some stuff.

905
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,000
要做個項目
It's for a project.

906
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,320
什么時候開始的
Since when?

01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,150
我們都還沒討論過人物呢
I mean, we haven't even talked about the characters yet.

908
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:43,000
你知道我有多喜歡這部分
You know how much I like that.

909
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,600
這個  我還在修改
Yeah, well... I'm still working on it.

910
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,130
情節還沒設定好
Don't quite have a plot yet.

911
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,350
我們可以來個頭腦風暴
Well, we can brainstorm a little bit.

912
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,300
我覺得這是我們最擅長的
You know, that's where I think we the best at.

913
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,630
我們的頭腦風暴
When we brainstorming.

914
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:01,960
我覺得這次我要自己頭腦風暴了
I think I gotta brainstorm this one by myself right now.

915
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,820
但是過一陣可以跟你討論
But I'd love to talk about it soon.

916
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,060
準備好了嗎  兄弟
You 'bout ready, bro?

917
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,140
那...
Well, um...

不管是什么項目
Whatever it is, uh...

919
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,360
我都為你驕傲
I'm proud of you.

Wow, look at him.

你那是什么破帽子  吉米
What the fuck is up with your hat, Jimmie?

924
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,030
你看著就像個會走路的煙頭  真受不了
You look like a human cigarette, I can't handle it.

01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,170
黑人愛麗絲夢游仙境

你竟然在畫他們
You're really drawing them?

961
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,520
他們就會滿嘴噴糞
They just talk shit.

962
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,670
我剛認識你的時候你也滿嘴噴糞
Well, you talked shit when I met you.

963
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,520

不過沒關系

那你為什么還跟我玩

你真的不在乎別人說的話嗎
You really don't give a fuck what anybody says?

969
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,080
因為他們對我刻薄我就不能喜歡他們了嗎
I shouldn't get to appreciate them 'cause they're mean to me?

970
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:01,100
太傻了
That's silly.

971
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,810
你怎么在這
What are you doing here?

你又是為什么在這
What are you ever doing here?

他們把鎖都換了
They changed the fuckin' locks on me.

976
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,830
我很遺憾  真糟糕
I'm sorry, that sucks.

977

你想怎樣  伙計

978
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:31,560
你要在這里待多久
How long you gonna be here?

979
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,020
我還沒想好
I don't know yet.

980
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,730
我只是想試著...
I'm just tryin' to...

981
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,840
放手

I wouldn't have that.

1121
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,630
可以理解
That's understandable.

1122
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,800
想買下那種房子是很困難的
It's going to be hard to land a place like that.

1123
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,470
但假如我換個問法...
But suppose I ask instead...

1124
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,470
不  不
No, no, look.

1125
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:39,680
我明白
I get it.

1126
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,520
我還年輕  我是黑人
I'm young. I'm black.

1127
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,360
我不富裕
I'm not rich.

1128
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:49,320
我來這里之前心里就有數了
I came here knowing all that.

1129
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,200
但我們現實一點  你也有指標要完成
But let's be real, you also got a quota to meet.

1130
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,570
我不是說你是個掠奪者  先生
Now I'm not calling you a predator... Sir.

1131
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,620
但你也想賺錢
But you're trying to make your money.

1132
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,410
所以讓我幫你吧  先生
So let me help you do that. Sir.

1133
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,120
{\an8}不是這樣辦事的
That's not the way this works.

1134
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,120
你可以給我隨便開價
You can give me whatever deal you gotta give me.

1135
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,620
我不在乎
I don't care what it is.

1136
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,790
因為不像那些違約的人
'Cause unlike all the other people that default,

1137
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,210
這是我唯一想要的房子
this is the only house I'll ever want.

1138
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,720
所以我絕不會拖欠每月的賬單
So I'll never miss a monthly bill, ever.

1139
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,050
{\an8}我完全理解你的感受  先生
I completely understand how you feel, sir.

1140
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,050
你可以給我開最高的利率
You can give me your highest interest rate.

1141
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,510
你可以給我開最高的利率  好嗎
You can give me your highest interest rate, okay?

1142
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,720
-隨便坑我  -不  我完全...
- Fuck... Fuck me. - No, I completely...

1143
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:17,850
你甚至都不需要良心不安
You don't even have to feel bad.

1144
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:19,350
你甚至都不需要良心不安
You don't even have to feel bad.

1145
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,900
好嗎  我會還上每一分錢
Okay? I will pay back every single cent.

1146
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,230
我很抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, sir.

1147
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,400
我會還上每一分錢
I will pay back every single cent.

1148
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,570
好吧  好吧  你贏了
Okay, okay, you win!

1149
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:38,200
好吧  歸你了
Okay, yep, it's yours.

1150
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,080
你這個迷人的混蛋  好吧
You charming bastard, okay.

1151
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,370
以后再聊  再見
Talk to you soon, buh-bye.

1152
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,920
最近怎樣  兄弟
How's it going, man?

1153
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,540
還不錯  先生
Fine, sir.

1154
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,630
我注意到我們談過房子正在出售
I noticed the house we discussed is now for sale.

1155
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,630
你的宣傳單里有些嚴重的漏洞
There are some alarming elements in your literature

1156
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,390
我認為你可能想知道
I thought you would like to know.

1157
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,020
房地產總局肯定也想知道
And certainly the Bureau of Real Estate would.

1158
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:06,520
這上面說從房子里能看到金門大橋
This claims the property has a view of the Golden Gate.

1159
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,270
我覺得這不是真的
Which... I don't think is true.

1160
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,780
這不對  這不是真的
Well, it isn't. It isn't true.

1161
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,860
它還說它有原裝的
It also claims to have all the original

1162
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,700
"室內設備  地板  和水龍頭"
"fixtures, floors, and faucets."

1163
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,620
這也不是真的
Isn't true.

1164
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,830
還有你打算公開沒有化糞池的事實嗎
And are you planning on disclosing that there's no septic tank?

1165
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,540
這意味著
Which means, any day now,

1166
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,210
花園隨時可能被屎淹沒
the garden could be flooded with shit.

1167
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,760
你想說什么  伙計
Where's this going, man?

1168
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,390
這些加在一起算得上是虛假廣告
All this together seems like false advertisement.

1169
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,390
能構成交易作廢
Which is grounds for void a sale.

1170
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:41,510
有可能吊銷房產經紀執照
Potential revoke of license.

1171
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,180
我想到了可能是你們
I thought it might've been you guys.

1172
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,610
你想怎么樣
What's your deal, man?

1173
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:51,940
我不想怎么樣
Don't have a deal.

1174
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:55,900
聽著
Look...

1175
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,450
即使不是我  這層樓也會有別人
Somebody on this floor would've gotten that house

1176
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,780
拿下那棟房子
if it wasn't me.

1177
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,330
至少我是本地人  好嗎
At least I'm from here, right?

1178
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:08,210
-我把你們的東西放在路邊是好意  -好吧
- I put your stuff on the street as a favor. - Okay.

1179
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,620
我本來可以把東西拖走
I could've had it trucked away,

1180
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:10,830
但我給你們留了下來了
but I left it out for you.

1181
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,630
聽著  混蛋
Look, dick wad.

1182
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:14,920
我不是在唬人  我會舉報你的
I'm not fucking around, I will report you.

1183
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:15,840
舉報什么呢
For what?

1184
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,340
掛出了能看到橋景  有室內設施的廣告嗎
Listing a view of the bridge? And fixtures?

1185
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,600
大家都這么干
Everybody does that.

1186
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,720
那玩意其實是我復制粘貼的
I literally copy-pasted that shit.

1187
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,980
關于那棟房子的歷史  你在騙人
Well, you're lying about the history of the house.

1188
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:27,730
-我沒有騙人  -你有
- I'm not lying about that. - Yes, you are!

1189
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:30,520
你說它是在一百年前建的  比實際時間要早
You say it was built one hundred years earlier than it actually was.

1190
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,900
聽著  這不是我編的
Look, I'm not making this up.

1191
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,150
就是你編的
Yes, you are!

1192
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,980
1946年詹姆斯·菲爾斯建了這棟房子
James Fails built this house in 1946.

1193
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,780
-詹姆斯  -菲爾斯
- James? - Fails!

1194
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,400
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

1195
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,490
聽著  伙計
Look, man.

1196
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,120
1857年的信托契約
Deed of Trust, 1857.

1197
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,250
建筑師吉爾胡利什么的
Architect Gil-hoo-ley, some shit.

1198
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,050
九十年代的時候  你說的菲爾斯沒保住房子
Your guy Fails lost it in the '90s.

1199
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,340
看  就在這寫著
See, right there.

1200
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,050
聽著  伙計
Look, man.

1201
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,930
如果你們需要一周時間來另找住處
If you need a week to find somewhere else,

1202
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,050
那就先住在那里
then take it.

1203
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,260
但是...
But...

1204
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,270
別跟我扯那些占屋者權利的屁話
Don't go pulling some squatters rights shit on me, man.

1205
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:09,850
我有你的信件
I got your mail.

1206
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,190
我知道你的名字
I know your name.

1207
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,570
我不想搞到報警
I don't want to call the cops.

1208
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,320
我不想對你這么做
I don't want to do that to you.

1209
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,460
你去哪了
Where'd you go?

1210
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,540
不重要  兄弟
Doesn't matter, bro.

1211
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,960
我把所有東西都搬進來了
I got everything inside.

1212
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,670
除了沙發
Except the couch.

1213
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,050
那玩意差點砸在我身上
That shit almost fell on me.

1214
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,480
吉姆
Jim...

1215
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:34,100
我和房產經紀人談過了
I spoke to the realtor.

1216
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,810
讓他去死吧
Yeah, fuck that guy.

1217
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,740
他會把我們趕出去
He's gonna throw us out.

1218
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,620
最終還會報警
And eventually call the cops.

1219
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,620
我不知道我們還能堅持這樣多久
I don't know how much longer we can keep doing this.

1220
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:56,000
如果你不能堅持  我理解
I understand if you can't.

1221
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,840
我真的理解
I do.

1222
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,760
但我不會走的
But I'm not leaving.

1223
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,180
-吉姆  他說你爺...  -我要去哪呢
- Jim, he said your grand... - Where am I gonna go?

1224
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,560
我爸住在單人房里
My dad's in the SRO.

1225
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,610
我姑姑遠在鳥不拉屎的地方
My aunt's out in bum fuck.

1226
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:20,820
我媽...
My mom...

1227
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:25,110
我根本不知道我媽在哪
Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

1228
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,580
我不走
I'm not leaving, bro.

1229
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:35,250
我是最后一個人了
I'm the last one left.

1230
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,090
我們可以去我家
We have my house.

1231
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,600
我不能回去那里  兄弟
I can't go back there, bro.

1232
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:55,850
蒙特
Mont,

1233
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,560
這棟房子...
this house...

1234
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,570
這就是我該做的
This is what I do.

1235
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,820
這是我們該做的  蒙特
It's what we do, Mont.

1236
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,660
這是屬于我們的
This is our shit.

1237
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,950
我們現在不能放棄
We can't give up now.

1238
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:11,910
我們必須抗爭
We gotta fight.

1239
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,830
對嗎
Right?

1240
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,540
對
Yeah.

1241
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,340
我支持你  兄弟
I'm with you, bro.

1242
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,760
你總是支持我
You always been with me.

1243
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:56,790
你在寫東西嗎
Shit, you're writing?

1244
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,290
嗯
Yeah.

1245
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,790
我覺得我想出了一部戲
I think I cracked a play.

1246
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,420
我想下周演  如果可以的話
I'd like to put it on next week, if that's all right?

1247
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:12,050
太好了  搞起來  兄弟
Hell, yeah, get it, bro!

你怎么穿得像個白人男孩
Why are you dressed like a white boy?

1276
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,620
是為了你們的小演出嗎

1277
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,640
天吶

上來吧  別不好意思
Yeah, come on in, don't be shy.

1289
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,820
這里是他爺爺建的
His grandpa built it.

1290
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,990
對一個黑人來說還不錯對吧
Not bad for a black man, huh?

1291
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:27,290
是啊
Oh, no.

1292
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:30,540

01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:45,680
你靠糖果賺了很多錢嗎
You make a lot of money on candy?

1296
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:47,220
賣糖

大多數搬進黑人社區的
Most of these new white people that's moving

1299
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,980
這些新白人

1300
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,060
他們根本不知道自己正站著的廚房里

1301
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,860
曾經有人被槍擊過

他只是邀請了我們
He just invited us.

1304
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,360
我不知道他們在搞什么奇怪的玩意
I don't know what weird shit they got goin' on,

1305
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,570

01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,970

He, you know, he used to come and walk my niece

1371
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:50,340
他常常陪她放學回家
home from school when she first moved up here.

1372
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:53,200
他是個小紳士  差不多吧
He was a little gentleman, or whatnot,

1373
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,680
很貼心...

實在悲傷
It's just sad.

1375
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:04,720
我訓練科菲打波普·華納橄欖球賽
I coached Kofi in Pop Warner.

1376
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,530
他總留下來幫我整理
He stayed behind and helped me pack up.

1377
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,150
每天都是
Every day.

1378
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:11,370

Yeah.

1379

1382
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,410
我把他逼得太緊了嗎
Did I push him too hard?

1383
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:33,040
科菲是我兄弟
Kofi was my nigga, man.

1384
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,410
我逼他太緊了嗎
Did I push him too hard?

1385

你呢
How 'bout you?

1386
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,460
好吧
Well...

1387
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,800
我對科菲最后的記憶
My last memory of Kofi

1388
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,370
是他對我滿嘴噴糞
was him talking shit to me.

1389
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,950
他說了一些我聽過的
He said some of the most fucked-up shit

1390
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:10,900
最操蛋的話
anybody's ever said to me.

1391
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,600
但科菲也曾
But Kofi also got jumped

1392
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,410
因在教養院幫我跟大孩子對峙而被突襲
for defending me against the older kids in the group home.

1393
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,750
他不喜歡打架
He didn't like to fight,

1394
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:25,330
但他那時為了我打架
but he fought for me then.

1395
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,250
人不止一面
People aren't one thing.

1396

聽聽
That.

1397
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,380
所有...所有這些
All... all of it.

1398
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,410
如果科菲能夠
What would have happened

1399
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,150
表現自己
if Kofi could've

1400
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,770
會發生什么
showed himself?

1401
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:02,670
他各方面的自己
All forms of himself.

1402
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:06,580
世界
The world

1403
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,520
把他困在一個盒子里
put him in a box!

1404
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:13,620
而他從未
And he never

1405
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:15,840
推開盒子
pushed beyond it.

1406
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:21,220
讓我們來
Let us.

1407
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:25,080
讓我們打破盒子
Let us break the boxes!

1408
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,590
讓我們給彼此勇氣
Let us give each other the courage!

1409
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:30,190
去...去看
To... to see!

1410
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,690
看我們的出身之外的世界
Beyond the stories we are born into!

1411
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:36,430
讓我們所有人
Let us all

1412
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:39,190
好好看看
really look

1413
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,360
吉米·菲爾斯四世

溫和善良的人
Gentle, loving man.

1417
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:01,040
一個真正的幸存者  吉米
A true survivor. Jimmie!

1418
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,130
你住過多少地方
How many places have you lived?

1419
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:05,100
如果他們明天把你趕出去
And if they kicked you out tomorrow,

1420
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:08,070
你還是這樣的人
you would still be all those things!

1421
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,970
你的存在超越...
You exist beyond the...

1422
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:13,270
這些墻  你超越你的...
these walls, you extend beyond your...

1423
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:15,190
你的祖先
your... your forefathers!

1424
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,160
你超越這個房子
You are more than this house!

1425
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,660
吉米  你不是這些...這些墻
Jimmie, you are not these... these walls!

1426
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,700
你不是這些地板  你不是這個天花板
You're not these floors, you're not this ceiling!

1427
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,280
-該讓你知道了  -兄弟  你在做什么
- It's time you know! - Bro, what are you doing?

1428
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,690
-你在做什么  -是時候了
- What are you doing? - It is time!

1429
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,660
-該讓你知道了  -我不需要知道
- It is time you know! - I don't need to know,

1430
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:29,510
我不需要知道  停下  停下
I don't need to know. Let's stop. Let's stop.

1431
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,750
-吉米  你不...  -夠了  停下
- Jimmie... You don't! - Enough, stop!

1432
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:36,210
-停下好嗎  蒙特  -吉米
- Please, stop. Mont! - Jimmie!

1433
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,770
-這房子不是你爺爺建的  -夠了
- Your grandpa didn't build this house! - Enough!

1434
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:44,950
不是他建的  吉米
He didn't build it, Jimmie!

1435
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:55,940
是他建的
Yes, he did.

1436
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:01,050
-這房子是他建的  -不是他  我看到了
- He built this house! - He didn't, I saw it, man,

1437
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:02,430
我看到了契約
I saw the deed.

1438
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,570
我看到了
I saw it.

1439
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,930
不知道那是什么情況
I don't know what the hell that thing was.

1440
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:57,990
然后他左勾拳
Then he shoots a left.

1441
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:02,950
讓他們走吧
Man, let 'em leave.

1442
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:05,390
反正他們也不配待在這里
They don't deserve to be in here anyway.

1443
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:11,790
我們也不配
Neither do we.

1444
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,360
你真的要聽
You gonna really listen to what

1445
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,610
另一個黑人給你說的真相嗎
another-ass nigga tell you what's true?

1446
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:24,340
拜托  杰博  挺起脊梁
Come on, Jayboe, get your spine up, son.

1447
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:27,200
-多些驕傲  -我一直在那么做
- Have some pride, man. - I've been doin'.

1448
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:36,980
但是你說出來吧
But you say it.

1449
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:39,880
說什么
Say what?

1450
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,670
真相
The truth.

1451
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,640
什么
What?

1452
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,420
這房子不是爺爺建的
That grandpa didn't build this house.

1453
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:52,940
老天  不要相信那些胡說八道
Man, get outta here with that bullshit.

1454
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:54,520
拜托  杰博
Come on, Jayboe.

1455
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,110
說吧
Just say it.

1456
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,130
我說不出來
Can't tell you shit.

1457
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,600
我要走了
I'm outta here, man.

1458
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:25,530
你愿意信就信吧
You sit in that bullshit if you want.

1459
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:57,270
杰博
Jayboe.

1460
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,340
這么久以來我一直跟人說是他建的
I been telling people he built it for so long.

1461
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:15,670
差點忘了這不是真的
Almost forgot it wasn't true.

1462
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:23,180
這曾是我們的
This was ours.

1463
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,010
然后又不是了
And then it wasn't.

1464
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,540
所以你只是告訴自己一些話
So you just tell yourself what you need

1465
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,830
讓你感覺這仍是我們的
to make you feel like it still is.

1466
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,030
見鬼
Shit.

1467
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,650
我也是一樣
I did it, too.

1468
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:45,670
會讓你覺得
It makes you feel

1469
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:48,430
與眾不同
special.

1470
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,410
但你現在有機會
But you got a chance to get out

1471
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:55,770
拋開這一切了
from underneath all of that now.

1472
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:59,370
我不想
I don't want to.

1473
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:03,090
我只想要這房子
I just want it.

1474
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,560
這是你真正想要的嗎
Is that what you really want?

1475
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:15,590
下半輩子都為此努力
To spend the rest of your life working for this?

1476
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,330
為此奮斗嗎
Fighting for this?

1477
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:26,100
我相信你能把這里變成自己的
I believe that you could make this place yours.

1478
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,390
我真的相信
I really do.

1479
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:36,520
但是如果你離開
But if you leave

1480
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,530
也不是你的損失
it's not your loss.

1481
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:46,390
是舊金山的損失
It's San Francisco's.

1482
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,150
去它的舊金山
Fuck San Francisco.

1483
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:39,040
-這個城市太遜了  -遜爆了
- This city blows. - Big time.

1484
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:40,950
我是說  我不介意
I mean, whatever, I'm not above

1485
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:43,540
住在從前的毒品屋里
living in a former crack house, you know?

1486
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:46,100
但是我來這里是為了珍妮絲和飛機樂隊
But, I came here for Janis and the Airplane,

1487
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:48,500
不是為了在該死的初創公司工作
not to work at a fucking startup.

1488
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,350
姐們  我說了幾個月了
Dude, I've been saying for months,

1489
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,050
我們搬去東洛杉磯吧
let's just move to East LA.

1490
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:53,510
這個城市已經死了
This city's dead.

1491
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:55,230
不
Nah.

1492
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,240
說真的  這城市見鬼去吧
Seriously, fuck this city.

1493
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,100
打擾一下
'Scuse me?

1494
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:05,460
你們不能恨舊金山
You don't get to hate San Francisco.

1495
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:10,140
你說什么
I'm sorry, what?

1496
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,700
是啊  老兄
Yeah, dude, I mean...

1497
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,910
不好意思  但我想恨什么就恨什么
Sorry, but I'll hate what I want.

1498
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,520
你們愛這里嗎
Do you love it?

1499
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:23,470
是啊  我住在這里
It's... I mean yeah, I'm here.

1500
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,720
但我一定要愛這里嗎
But do I have to love it?

1501
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:29,220
沒有愛就不能恨
You don't get to hate it unless you love it.

1502
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:34,500
典型的公交破事
Classic Muni shit.

1503
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:46,070
誰贏錢了  快點  快點
Who call the money man, come on now, hurry up.

1504
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,730
注意點
Pay attention!

1505
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,490
亞歷山大大帝是個黑人
Alexander the Great was a black man.

1506
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:55,010
邪惡的教育體系里不會教這個
They don't teach you that in the devil school system.

1507
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:59,730
這破日子我一天也忍不下去了
I can't take another day of this bullshit.

1508
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:08,560
吉姆
Jim.

1509
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:16,700
很抱歉我那么做了
I'm sorry I did that.

1510
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,700
那是個愚蠢的話劇
It was a stupid play.

1511
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:25,160
不
Nah.

1512
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,060
很抱歉我沒告訴你真相
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

1513
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:34,810
我只是希望那是真的
I just wanted it to be true.

1514
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:38,540
那感覺特別好  你知道嗎
It felt so good, you know?

1515
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,670
沒事的
It's okay.

1516
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:06,750
吉米
Jimmie.

1517
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,280
你餓嗎
Are you hungry?

1518
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:10,920
餓死了
Fucking starving.

1519
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:17,120
他放棄了
He's giving up.

1520
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:20,230
我忍不下去了
I can't take no more.

1521
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,670
他崩潰了
He's breaking down.

1522
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,930
他真的把這公寓拆了個底朝天
He's really tearing this apartment apart.

1523
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,820
不過這看著讓人激動
This looks exciting though, you know?

1524
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,680
-沒錯  是的  -是嗎  真的嗎
- Yeah. Yeah, it is. - Yeah? Oh, yeah?

1525
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:37,490
我現在懂了
I got it now.

1526
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:39,620
他看起來很饑渴之類的
He seems like he's horny or something.

1527
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:47,370
他又在砸門了
He's banging on the door again.

1528
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:24,970
{\an8}出自1950年美國電影《死亡漩渦》

1529
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:23,530
你好  威爾
Hi, Will.

1530
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:24,970
我今天要出發去舊金山
I'm leaving for San Francisco today,

1531
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:26,050
不過我大約一周后回來
but I'll be back in about a week,

1532
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:27,740
到時候我會幫你處理的
I'll take care of it for you then.

1533
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:28,850
他可真刻薄  不是嗎
Sure is a scorcher, isn't it

1534
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:30,130
我見過他更刻薄的樣子
Well, I've seen him worse.

1535
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:31,470
祝你愉快  伯特
Well have a nice time, Bert.

1536
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:33,940
