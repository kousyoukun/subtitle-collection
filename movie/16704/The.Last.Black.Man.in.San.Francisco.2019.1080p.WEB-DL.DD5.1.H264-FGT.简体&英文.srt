Jasmine?

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,250
贾丝敏  我们要迟到了  快过来
Jasmine! We gonna be late, come on.

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,410
我们走吧
Let's go.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,170
为什么他们有防护服穿  而我们没有
Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,230
有些事正在我们面前发生
Something's going on right in our face.

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,400
你们却天天盯着iPhone
You're so stuck on those iPhones,

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,800
Jphone 12s什么的
Jphone 12s or whatever,

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,640
那玩意儿能在你手里爆炸
blow up in your hand.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,850
你用谷歌可查不到正在发生的事情
You can't Google what's going on right now.

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,390
你们在听吗
Are y'all paying attention?

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,900
为什么他们有防护服穿  而我们没有
Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,320
为什么啊
Why?

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,610
他们是来净化这片水域的吗
They here to clean this water?

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,240
这片水域已经又脏又臭五十年了
When this water been dirtier than the Devil's mouth for 50 years.

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,120
现在他们想起来清理了
And now they want to clean it?

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,870
他们没安好心  各位
They got plans for us, man.

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,890
就跟乔治·杰森被解雇一样
Looking like George Jetson rejects.

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,890
{\an8}1962年美国动画《杰森一家》中的人物  该动画讲述了住在未来的一家人的生活  故事中他的老板总是会以愤怒的方式解雇乔治  直到同一集结束时才再次聘用他

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,130
因为他们不行
'Cause they weak!

38
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,300
心脏不行
Weak hearts!

39
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,670
肺也不行
Weak lungs!

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,130
不戴个面具都不能在这里呼吸
Can't even breathe up here without a mask.

41
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,720
但我们为了得到净化  经历炼狱之苦
But we was put through hell to be purified.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
你们懂我在说什么吗  兄弟姐妹们
You know what I'm sayin', brothers and sisters?

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,060
老天  看看监狱把黑人折磨成什么样了
Man, it's crazy what jail will do to a nigga.

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,370
他们根本就不在乎这片水域
They don't care about their water, man,

45
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,460
这事有隐情
there's something going on,

46
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,320
我们必须追根究底
we gonna get to the bottom of it.

47
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,050
算他们走运  我如今是上帝的子民
And they lucky I'm a man of God right now.

48
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,010
你觉得他每天早上都会排练这段话吗
You think he rehearses this every morning?

49
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,160
否则我会给他们好看
Or they would catch these hands.

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,870
感觉即兴的成分更多
Seems a bit more impromptu.

51
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,760
2019年了
2019 out here!

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,390
我们为这里的污水问题奔走的时候
We been yellin' about this water

53
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,170
他们还没出生呢
since before they were born.

54
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,250
那时候他们还没出生呢
Before they were born!

55
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,050
公交车怎么还不来  我们来不及了
Where's this bus, man? We're not gonna make it.

56
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,390
你们离我们远点
Y'all leave us the hell alone.

57
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,800
除非你们真的是来帮我们的
Unless y'all really here to help us.

58
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,060
我们会到的
We'll get there.

59
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,280
他们另有目的  各位
They got plans for us, man.

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,410
我们来不及了  兄弟
We're not gonna make it, bro.

61
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,790
但是对你我没有好处
Not for you and me.

62
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,200
所以我劝诸位啊
So I urge you!

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,940
为你们的土地抗争
Fight for your land!

64
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,690
为你们的家园抗争
Fight for your home!

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,240
-为你们的...  -我们滑滑板吧
- Fight for your... - Let's skate.

66
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,960
这里
This here?

67
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,880
这里就是边境了  兄弟
This is the edge, bro!

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,420
命定扩张论的最后边疆
The final frontier of Manifest Destiny.

69
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,420
{\an8}19世纪美国人的一种信条
认为对外扩张是美国的天命

70
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,840
城市的最后界限
Last edge of the city.

71
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,530
兄弟  再走两步
Man, two steps further,

72
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,180
你就要去喝那肮脏的咸水了
you'll be drinking that filthy saltwater.

73
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,730
但我们造了这些船
But we built these ships.

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,770
疏浚了这些运河
Dredged these canals.

75
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,820
在旧金山这块他们从不知道存在的土地上
In the San Francisco they never knew existed.

76
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,500
现在他们才来造点新东西是吧
And now they come to build something new?

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,090
整个街区一半落后  一半先进
Whole blocks half in the past, half in the future.

78
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,680
但如果你闯入他们的旧金山
But should you venture into their San Francisco,

79
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,010
被他们掠夺黄金的地方
the one they pillaged for gold!

80
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,260
在那座虚伪之城
Remember your truth!

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,680
坚守你的真理
In the city of facades.

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,940
带上我
Take me with you!

83
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,360
带上我  伙计
Take me with you, man!

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,990
拜托  我们要去哪
Come on, where are we going?

85
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,410
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

86
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,330
来吧  我来了  我来了
Come on, I'm coming! I'm coming!

87
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,800
看看他们看你的样子
Look at them look at you.

88
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,380
居高临下  不屑一顾
Look down at you.

89
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,760
但这些房子都是我们造的
But we built them!

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,470
我们就是这些房子
We are these homes!

91
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,810
他们的眼睛
Their eyes...

92
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,310
他们的尖顶
Their pointed brims...

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,980
他们搬家  我们也要搬家
We move if they move.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,360
每一块木头都浸着我们的汗水
Our sweat soaked in the wood.

95
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,160
以我们的意象镀了金
Gilded in our image.

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,540
这是我们的家
This is our home!

97
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,460
我们的家
Our home!

98
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,170
我们的家
Our home.

99
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,760
谢了
Thanks.

100
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,850
你确定他们走了吗
Are you sure they're gone?

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,780
吉姆
Jim?

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
他们的车不在了
I mean, their car is gone.

103
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,500
我们去后门看看  兄弟
Let's check the back, man.

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,760
早上好
Good morning.

105
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,830
你们好吗
How are you?

106
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,550
还记得他们在厨房那次吗
Remember that time they were in the kitchen?

107
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,800
吉姆
Jim!

108
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,430
还记得厨房那次吗
Remember the kitchen?

109
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,970
当然记得
Yeah, sure.

110
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,760
但是兄弟...
But, bro...

111
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,390
我不是说过这些栏杆是蓝紫色吗  不是黑色
Didn't I tell you these railings are periwinkle, not black.

112
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,650
嗯  知道了
Yeah, I got it.

113
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,530
我们不能再两周来一次了  得更勤点
We gotta start coming more than every two weeks, bro.

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,040
这破花园简直一团糟
This fuckin' garden's a nightmare.

115
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,460
下次来我可以带上我爷爷的工具
I'll bring my grandpa's tools next time.

116
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,040
你千万得带上
Please do.

117
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,850
墙纸在剥落
Wallpaper's chipping.

118
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,930
这房子要被他们毁了
These people are killing this house.

119
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,910
但你不能进去
You're not goin' in though.

120
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,850
吉姆
Jim?

121
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,230
我觉得...
I mean...

122
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,070
我觉得...
I mean...

123
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,400
不进去了
No?

124
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,780
但他们肯定走了
They're definitely gone, though.

125
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,030
这次最好动作快点
Better be quick this time.

126
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,080
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

127
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,750
这事儿快不了
Takes time.

128
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,710
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

129
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,540
我去老地方
I'll be at my spot.

130
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,130
好
All right.

131
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,630
快点
Quick.

132
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,170
行
Okay.

133
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,680
-老天爷  -亲爱的
- Jesus, man! - Honey.

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,350
你快给我下来
Just get the heck out of here, man.

135
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,100
-什么鬼  -他又没伤人  梅尔
- What the fuck? - He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

136
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,560
现在他又漆上房子了
He's painting the house now?

137
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
是啊
Well, yeah.

138
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,420
别再修缮我的房子了
Stop fixing my house!

139
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,260
我都快弄好了  再等等
I'm almost done, just hold on.

140
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,650
你怎么不去漆邻居家的房子
Why don't you just paint the neighbors' houses?

141
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,050
他们家比我们家还破
Theirs are worse than ours.

142
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,780
再等一会儿就好
Just hold on one second.

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,220
在某种程度上
I mean, we appreciate it,

144
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,030
我们是很感谢你
in some way, but, yeah...

145
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,330
但你这样很奇怪  小伙子
It's weird, man!

146
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,650
我都快弄完了
I'm almost done.

147
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,290
我们会报警的  小伙子
Look, we will call the cops, man.

148
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,580
这次我是认真的
And I mean it this time.

149
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,880
不  我们不会报警的
No, we're not gonna call the cops.

160
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,140
兄弟  你本该负责把风的

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,940
你真的不能再吃这里的鱼了
You really gotta stop eating the fish out there.

166
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,440
我觉得没事

我没想过要做那破事...
I ain't tryin' do that bullshit...

175
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,310
{\an8}别耍把戏了  当心我把你的脸打烂
Stop playin' before I slap the shit out your face.

179
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,070

我昨晚看见妈妈她们了

她看起来头有点秃了

我们可都用一样的水洗澡  吉姆

187
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,100
我是在劝他别吃鱼了
I was trying to tell him not to eat the fish,

188
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,730
因为水有毒
because the water is toxic.

189
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,800
那是因为他们就在那儿造的原子弹  老兄
That's 'cause they built the atomic bomb right there, nigga.

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,020
我觉得那不是真的
I don't think that's true.

191
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,020

我就该扯烂你的脏辫
I should snatch your one-ass dread,

290
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,230
你他妈看起来就像拉斯塔法里教徒
lookin' like a fuckin' Rastafarian sperm.

291
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,380
你们烦死了
You got me fucked up.

292
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,920
我们烦死了  没错
We got you fucked up! We did!

293
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
你就打算说这个
That's all you gotta say?

294
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,510
伙计  那我该怎么做  掉头就走
Man, what I'm supposed to do, take off?

295
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,720
我对这些一点都不在乎
I don't care about none of that shit.

296
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,430
我知道  但我没有别的话要说了
I know, I just ain't got nothin' else to say.

297
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,310
说句实话  这个家伙就是个孬种
Man, I put that on a fact, that this nigga's a bitch, man.

298
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,040
说得对  兄弟  让他去死吧
Is that sure, man. Man, fuck this nigga.

299
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,750

How are you, nigga?

303
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,890
我希望她不在家
I hope she's not home.

304
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,390
那个花园
That garden...

305
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,690
我们要干的事太多了
We have so much to do.

306
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,540
我们得犁地
We have to rake it.

307
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,790
我们得除草
We have to weed it.

308
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,070
-我们得...  -吉姆

309
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,780
那不是你以前住的车吗
Isn't that the car you used to live in?

310
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,710
天啊
Oh, God.

311
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,780
吉米

你好吗  臭烘烘的混蛋东西

314
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,590
吉米

发生什么事了  宝贝

316
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,760
未老先衰的混蛋  快上车
Get your young, old-looking ass in the car.

317
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,310
长脸驴

318
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,660
吉米
Jimmie!

319
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,870
天啊  公交车怎么还没来
Oh, my God, where is this bus?

320
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,330
你这个穿衬衫的老混蛋
Man, if you don't get your up

321
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,770
要是还不快点滚到车上来
the father from Good Times shirt-wearing ass in this car...

322
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,710
你真的要拿着铲子坐公交车吗
You really gonna ride in the bus with a shovel?

323
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,030
农夫小子  快点上车
Get your farming ass in this car.

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,950
农夫吉米  你个混蛋

325
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,080
拜托  笑一下嘛  吉米
Come on, laugh a little bit, Jimmie, shit.

326
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,130
还是老样子
Still the same.

327
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,340
是的  我喜欢你跟你爸的杰作
Yep, I like what you and your dad did with it.

328
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,760
喜欢到你直接把它开走了
So much you drove off with it?

329
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,940
不  我是借的  我没有...
No, I borrowed it, I didn't, just, come on...

330
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,720
我把它开走了  靠  我借的
I drove off with it... I borrowed it, shit.

331
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,720

Matter of fact, I seen your dad the other day.

332
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,600
他一人过得挺好
He was good and lonely.

333
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,060
孤身一人
By hisself.

334
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,690
好吧
Okay.

335
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,250
我跟他说  你得养只猫或狗
I told him you need to get you a cat or a dog,

336
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,190
或者找个女人之类的
or woman or something, nigga, damn.

337
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,460
他独自在家
He's home alone...

338
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,030
那不是他家  但他孤身一人
Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

339
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,620
他孤身一人  还没有家
He's alone with no home.

340
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,910
你也是自己一个人  住在车里
Well, you live in a car by yourself.

341
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,290
是住车里  但我不孤独
Yeah, but I... But I'm not alone.

342
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,290
大家都喜欢我
People like me.

343
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,300
我很受欢迎
I'm liked.

344
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,300
孤独的兄弟
Lonely ass nigga.

345
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,680
你上一次见你爸是什么时候
When the last time you hung out with your daddy?

346
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,310
几周前  说不清
Couple weeks ago, I dunno.

347
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,690
几周前  他现在就需要你
Couple weeks ago? The nigga needs you today.

348
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,820
靠
Shit.

349
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,000
养儿防老  这就是大家生孩子的原因
That's what... That's what people have kids for,

350
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,740
这样他们就能有人陪伴
so they can have some companionship!

351
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,320
有人一起玩
Somebody to hang out with.

352
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,370
这就是我不要孩子的原因
That's why I ain't had no kids.

353
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,200
因为我不想被打扰
'Cause I don't wanna be bothered.

354
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,210
你爸不想要这辆破车  伙计
Your daddy don't want this fuckin' car, man.

355
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,460
这不是萨沃伊公寓吗
Wasn't that the Savoy House?

356
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,380
曾经是
Sure was.

357
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,010
这里以前住了上百个人  廉租房
It was 100 motherfuckers in there, rent-controlled.

358
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,840
他们以为这地方是他们的
They thought they owned that shit.

359
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,430
房东把那些人全都赶走了
The landlord burned all of the people outta there.

360
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,520
因为你看  吉米
'Cause see, Jimmie,

361
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,640
你其实一无所有
you never really own shit.

362
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,480
这车不属于我
This car ain't mine.

363
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,360
但是也从来不属于你
But it never was yours.

364
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,240
你一无所有
You never own shit!

365
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,090
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?

366
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,610
发生什么了  伙计
What's goin' on, man?

367
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,060
不知道  兄弟
No se, bro.

368
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,340
先生
Sir...

369
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,000
发生什么了
What's... What's going on?

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,480
天呐
Oh, God.

371
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,400
她要搬走了
She's moving.

372
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,690
跟她妹妹争得死去活来
Fighting like crazy with her sister.

373
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,790
家里有人去世后
When someone dies in the family,

374
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,610
白人总是这样
that's what white people do.

375
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,240
这是她的  这是他的  这是我的
This is for her, this is for him, this is mine.

376
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,200
这房子该归谁
Who's gonna have the house?

377
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,040
他们失去房子了
So they lost the house?

378
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,660
房子现在归谁名下
Who's gonna possess the house?

379
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,310
他们只是吵架  不停争斗
They're just fighting, and fighting, and fighting.

380
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,540
现在会发生什么
What's gonna happen to it now?

381
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,000
为什么她妈妈死了  他们就得搬出去
Why'd they have to move out 'cause her mom died?

382
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,310
我不知道
I don't know.

383
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,590
他们毫无品味
They were tasteless,

384
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,720
但是至少他们没把房子毁了
but at least they didn't fuck it up.

385
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,620
总共十美元  亲
Well, that will be $10, hun.

386
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,660
怎么这么贵
Since when?

387
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,730
六十块特趣巧克力  这是最划算价格了
Since that's the best deal you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

388
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,860
我没有说要六十块  我说要十六块
I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie. I said 16.

389
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,040
我怎么吃得了六十块
How I'm gonna eat 60 Twix?

390
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,490
我哪知道你有什么毛病
I don't know your life.

391
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,610
你以为你这是好又多那种批发超市吗
You act like you in Costco or something like that.

392
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,040
你这可不是好又多
You ain't Costco.

393
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,350
要是想去好又多  那你就去啊
You can go to Costco if you need to.

394
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,060
-你个傻逼  -现在就去啊
- You Rosco. - Go right now.

395
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,340
十六  你第一次...
Sixteen, first time you had...

396
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,600
吉姆  吉姆

398
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,910
吉姆
Jim?

399
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,920
两位先生
So, gentlemen.

400
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,590
有什么可以帮到你们的
What can I do for you?

401
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,980
我们想打听一栋房子
Yeah, we're curious about a house

402
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,050
位于金门大桥附近  菲尔莫尔街

It's 959.

404
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,740
灰墙  金边
It's the gray, it's got the gold trim.

405
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,510

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,140
就是那个
Yeah, exactly.

我知道你们说的是哪一栋
I know exactly what you're talking about,

411
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,070
那栋房子非常特别
that place is very special.

412
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,130
我以前每天上学都会开车经过那栋房子
I used to drive past that house on the way to school every day.

413
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,750
你是哪所学校的
What school did you go to?

414

416
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,890
你也是本地人吗
You from here, too?

Really?

420
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,980
我们以前经常和你们踢足球比赛
Yeah, we used to play y'all in football all the time.

421
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,600

太棒了  真的

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,900
但是  那房子在出售吗  我没听说
But, so, it's for sale? I didn't hear about that.

426
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,970
我不确定
Well, I'm not sure.

427
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,760

574
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,180
我真受不了
Oh, my goodness.

575
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,700
见鬼  我知道你有一些  结果全都在你这吗
Damn, I knew you had some of it, but is this everything?

576
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,360
除了被你爸吸毒变卖的之外  都在这了
Everything your dad didn't smoke up.

577
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,640
不好意思  玩笑开得有点重
Sorry, came out a little harsh.

578
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,040
没关系
I'm fine.

579
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,620
你真的全都保留下来了
You really got all of this.

这太棒了
That's amazing.

584
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,820
我知道
Yeah, I knew that,

585
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,390
这个家族里的所有人之中
out of everybody in this family,

586
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,930
只有你会来找这些东西
you would be the one that come looking for this stuff.

587
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,630
那么
So...

588
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,830
我可以
I can...

589
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,330
全部拿走吗
Everything?

590
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,890

-谢谢  -是啊

592
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,030
瑞奇  把卡车开过来

593
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,040
你们俩在后面还好吗
You guys good back there?

594

谢谢
Thank you.

596
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,250
所以瑞奇从没在这房子里住过
So, Ricky never lived in the house?

597
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,590
没有  我们失去这栋房子的时候
No, Wanda didn't meet him

598
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,700
旺达还不认识他
until after we lost it.

599
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,070
-你好  先生  -你好

605
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,270

Sure, sure, nice to meet you, man.

607
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,690
现在房子卖得太快了
It's a fast-moving market,

608
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,700
我都不记得这里竖过牌子
I don't even remember a sign going up.

609
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,330
没必要竖牌子  但...
It didn't need to, but...

610
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,910
听着  蒂姆  我想告诉你
Look, Tim, I want you to know

611
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,370
你绝对没见过比我更好的邻居
I'm going to be the best damn neighbor you ever had.

612
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,950
好...
Well...

613
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,900
-好的  吉米  谢谢  -乐意效劳
- All right, Jimmie, thank you. - My pleasure.

614
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,930
抱歉  我先失陪了
Well, you'll have to pardon me,

615
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,640
我们还有很多事要做  但...
we've got lots to do, but...

-当然  好的  -认识你很高兴  嗯
- Of course, oh, yeah. - Very nice to meet you, yeah.

617
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,240
这到底是怎么回事
What the fuck was that all about?

618
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,020
我想一边喝咖啡
I wanna drink my coffee

619
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,360
一边看报纸一边挠屁股
and scratch my ass while I read the paper.

620
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,960
你从不看报纸  吉米
You don't read the paper, Jimmie.

621
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,880
那是因为我没有一个可以在里面看报纸的家
'Cause I never had a home to read it in.

622
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,810
见鬼
Shit.

623
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,150
我们可以开派对
We could throw parties.

624
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
上演你的话剧
You could put on one of your plays.

625
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,060
大喊大叫
We could yell.

626
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,700
-注意邻居  吉米  -邻居
- The neighbors, Jimmie. - Oh, the neighbors?

这兄弟是个孬种
This nigga is a bitch.

630
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,600
我就是有点害怕  假装逃跑
I'm a soft nigga. Run the fake, nigga!

631
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,940

Man, last night, a white van pulled up.

637
00:41:59,370 --> 00:41:59,710
我对天发誓  兄弟
I swear to God, bro.

638
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,300
科菲像个怂包似的直接逃了
This nigga Kofi ran like a straight bitch!

639
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,290
-他没骗你  -他会害死我们的

Shut the fuck up, bro, he's a straight sucker, bro.

643
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,290
伙计  他这样让别人觉得我们都是孬种
Man, he got us looking like bitches, bro.

644
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,290
如果让我说
If I've gotta get on this thing,

645
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,380
我就会质问你
I'm gonna be questioning you!

00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,380
怎么了
What?

710
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,620
过来  帮我把这些剪了
Come here, help me cut these out.

711
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,710
确保压着线剪
And make sure the color bleeds all the way through,

712
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,290
别留白边  懂吗
no white edges, aight?

713
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,800
是  长官  和以前一样
Yes, sir. Same as always.

714
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,380
没错
Yeah.

715
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,820
和以前一样
Same as always.

716
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,270
你记得我们偷住过的那个仓库吗
you remember that, warehouse we squatted at?

717
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,100
在我们离开埃尔多拉多之后
After we lived in the El Dorado?

718
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,420
我们没交税所以失去了那栋房子  对吗
We lost that ' cause we didn't pay taxes, right?

719
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,340
当然不是
Hell, nah.

720
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,990
我交的税可不少了
I paid our fair share of tax on that.

721
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,620
但谁在乎  通风管老化的蟑螂窝
But who cares, old drafty-ass roach nest.

722
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,100
破地方  但只有那里可以住
Shit, it was that,

723
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,160
否则就只能带着你睡大街了
or sleeping on the street with your little ass.

724
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,830
爸  我很知足
Well, I appreciate it, Dad.

725
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,610
那如果我现住的房子
So, say I'm at a place now

726
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,330
房主离开了
and the owners left it,

727
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,630
我会给这栋房子交税
I'm gonna pay taxes on it...

728
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,610
而且以你的名义付煤气和电费
And you put gas and electric in your name?

729
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,230
对  我接下来就去办  你知道我会的
Right, I'm gonna do that next, you know I know.

730
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,650
行  学你老爸
Okay, doin' it like your old man.

731
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,370
不错啊
That's good.

732
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,010
没人会来看这栋房子吗
And nobody's come to check on it?

733
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,550
没有  是栋空房子
Nope. It's empty.

734
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,520
好啊
Good.

735
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,040
这能争取些时间
That buys you time.

736
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,630
他们已经离开三年了吗
And they been gone three years?

737
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,290
没有  最近刚走
Nah, just recently.

738
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,780
等等  什么
Wait, what?

739
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,950
他们还住在里面你就开始修缮了
You were workin' on it while they were still in it?

740
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,160
对
Yeah.

741
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,670
这房子在哪里
Where is this house?

742
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,370
就是菲尔莫尔街上那栋房子
It's the house in Fillmore.

743
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,010
什么房子
What house?

744
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,150
我们的老房子
Our old house.

745
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,150
你他妈什么意思  我们的老房子
What the fuck you mean, our old house?

746
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,010
你去看过那栋房子吗
Have you seen that house?

747
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,020
看过  我是说
Well, yeah, I mean,

748
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:22,580
我经常去
I be over there all the time.

749
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,930
那你应该知道那不是你的老房子
Then you know that's not your old house

750
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,920
那里也不是你的黑人社区
and that's not your black-ass neighborhood.

751
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:34,340
目无尊长满嘴胡话的小兔崽子
Little disrespectful lyin' ass.

752
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,580
-你在说什么  -我知道你还在玩滑板
- What are you talking about? - Nigga, I know you skateboard!

753
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,030
是的
Yeah.

754
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,430
我看到你在外面干什么了
Yeah, I see all that shit out there.

755
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,770
每个人的道路
Everybody's little path.

756
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,480
我也就比你们领先三十步吧
I'm like 30 steps ahead of y'all.

757
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:04,230
走吧
Go on.

758
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,830
滚
Get!

759
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,980
你知道我们再也不提那栋房子了
You know we don't talk about that house no more.

760
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,090
把东西放下滚吧
Put the shit down and go!

761
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,380
你在这儿等很久了吗
You been waiting here long?

762
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,000
很久了  兄弟
Hella long, bro.

763
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,550
我可能直接滑滑板了
I might just skate.

764
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,010
那也不错
Well, that's nice.

765
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,130
这家伙疯了
This guy fucks.

766
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:28,730
桑迪普  桑迪普  兄弟  这家伙疯了
Sundeep. Sundeep, bro, this guy fucks.

767
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,580
这家伙疯了
This guy fucks!

768
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,370
这家伙疯了
This guy fucks!

769
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:35,120
这家伙疯了  这家伙疯了
This guy fucks! This guy fucks!

770
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,950
这家伙疯了  这家伙疯了
This guy fucks! This guy fucks!

771
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,770
这家伙疯了  这家伙疯了
This guy fucks! This guy fucks!

772
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,860
这城市就这德行
this city.

773
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,130
我早明白了  兄弟
I already know, bro.

774
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,580
操
Fuck!

775
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,360
你没事吧
Are you okay?

776
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,100
没事
Yeah.

777
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,190
没事
Yeah.

778
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,550
这是什么
What is all this?

779
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,930
以前我爸做自己的事时
A little room I used to come in

780
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,500
我就待在这个小房间里
when my dad was doing his thing.

781
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,620
很酷  对吗
It's cool, right?

782
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,380
对  哥们
Yeah, man.

783
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,170
你今天去见他了吗
Did you see him today?

784
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,770
聊得怎样
How'd it go?

785
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,480
他说这是个坏主意
He said this was a bad idea.

786
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,420
你不是说他就是个蠢货吗
Thought you said he was an idiot.

787
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,530
不  他就是气自己把房子弄没了
Nah, he's just mad 'cause he lost the house.

788
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,490
但是如果我们不该来这呢
But what if we shouldn't be here?

789
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,580
那还轮得到谁来
Who should be here more?

790
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,020
某个百万富翁
Some millionaire?

791
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,920
他们喜欢这里只是因为这栋房子好看
They'd want it 'cause it looks nice.

792
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,860
因为你这房子才能完美如初  吉姆
You're the reason it looks nice, Jim.

793
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,260
这可说不好
I don't know.

794
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,060
搞什么
What the fuck?

795
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,430
我请了人过来
I invited somebody.

796
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,070
怎么样  兄弟
What's good, nigga?

797
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,670
真高兴你能过来
Glad you could make it.

798
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,150
怎么回事
What's goin' on?

799
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,560
一会儿就过来  稍等
Be back in a sec, pardon me.

800
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,080
你们还有管风琴
Y'all got an organ?

801
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,110
还有立柱啥的
Columns and shit.

802
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,960
只有你们两个人吗
It's just y'all here?

803
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,780
对
Yeah.

804
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:13,700
老房子自己会响
It just makes noises.

805
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:16,200
好吧
Okay.

806
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,120
看你坐在这把椅子真不错
It's nice to see you in that chair,

807
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,550
没猜到你会挑这把
I didn't know you'd pick that one.

808
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,400
多谢  哥们
Thanks a lot, bro.

809
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,150
有点奇怪  不过这地方挺棒的
Kinda awkward, but this place is cool.

810
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,220
是啊
Yeah.

811
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,180
吉米做了很多修缮工作
Jimmie's been doing a lot to fix it up.

812
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,060
你们怎么搞到这栋房子的
How'd y'all get this?

813
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:34,620
是吉米的
It's Jimmie's.

814
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,070
他爷爷建的
His grandpa built it.

815
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,790
他是第一个来旧金山的黑人
He was the first black man in San Francisco.

816
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,880
反正别人都是这么说的
That's what they call him anyways.

817
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,100
我去
Shit.

818
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:47,580
就是这栋房子吗
This that house?

819
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,580
吉米之前总说起这地方
Jimmie used to talk about this spot all the time.

820
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,430
但是你也知道教养院里的那些家伙
But you know how niggas be in the group home.

821
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,110
牛逼吹破天
Overexaggerating and shit.

822
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,320
显得自己与众不同
Trying to be all special.

823
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,480
但是这个地方不是你胡编出来的  吉米
You weren't lying about this one, though, h Jimmie?

824
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,010
你住过教养院
You were in a group home?

825
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,040
对
Yeah.

826
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,810
住了一年吧
For like a year.

827
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,010
对
Yep.

828
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,470
想去做个汗蒸吗
You guys wanna go for a schvitz?

829
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,990
啥东西
A what?

830
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,550
等等  这也是你爷爷建的吗
Wait, your grandfather made this too?

831
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,690
不  不  这是那些白人建的
Nah. Nah, these white people did.

832
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,450
但你怎么知道他是第一个来的
Well, how you know he was the first one, though?

833
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,370
肯定说谎喽
Nigga be lyin'.

834
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:58,290
兄弟  他从新奥尔良过来
Bro, he came over here from New Orleans.

835
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:01,000
这里全都是日本人
There was hella Japanese people, bro.

836
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,360
后来他们全都被关进了集中营
And then they got thrown into little war camps

837
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,690
他不想住进别人的家里
and he wasn't tryin' to move into nobody else's shit,

838
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,330
所以他就建了这栋房子
so he built this, bro.

839
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,550
太屌了
This is great.

840
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,090
你还玩滑板吗  兄弟
You still skate, bro?

841
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,210
不
Nah.

842
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,480
不  我不玩了
No, I don't skate no more.

843
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,920
靠  你以前可挺牛逼的
Shit, I mean, you used to be hella raw.

844
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,230
是啊
Yeah.

845
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,330
我不知道  我...
I don't know, I'm, uh...

846
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:30,720
你还记得冈南吗
you remember Gunna?

847
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,380
他偷卖糖的女士的东西被抓了
Remember when he got caught stealing from the candy lady?

848
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,870
他哭起来太他妈难看了
Yeah, he's an ugly-ass crier, really.

849
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,210
天啊
Man.

850
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,500
丑到家了
Hurt as fuck!

851
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,550
记不记得侯默女士

He goin', "Damn, that white lady couldn't cut no hair!"

856
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,510
把那家伙的脑袋剪得像伦巴第大街似的
Had that nigga's shit lookin' like Lombard Street.

那家伙说伦巴...

顺着大厅走到头
It's down the hall.

863
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,620
有爪足浴缸的那间
It's the room with the little claw-foot tub.

你应该
You should, uh...

878
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,990
你应该给自己找个房间
You should have your own room, bro.

879
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:21,800
没关系的  吉姆
That's okay, Jim.

880
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,440
不  我是认真的  伙计

哪间都行吗
Any room?

884
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,630
这间怎么样
How about this one?

885
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,650
你确定你要住在餐厅里吗
Are you sure you want the dining room?

886
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,200
对
Yeah.

887
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:11,810
完美无瑕
It's perfect.

888
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,200
志存高远  兄弟
Dream big, bro.

是你的了
It's yours.

890
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,650
我们得把这件事搞清楚
Yeah, we're gonna have to figure something out.

891
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:37,910
我没有那么多的时间
I don't have that much time.

892
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,950
情况很复杂
It's a complicated situation.

893
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,140
不  供电恢复了  我要账单上写我的名字
No, the power's been on, i just need the bill in my name.

894
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,080
好  那我什么时候能收到首次账单
Okay, great. Well, when will I get the first invoice?

895
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,610
你不能再快一点寄过来吗
And you can't mail that any sooner?

896
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,830
他在说什么付账单的事
He's talking about paying some bills.

897
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,430
他要是想多分担一点我也不会拒绝
'Cause I wouldn't say no if he offered to chip in a little more.

898
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,060
他已经分摊一半了  爷爷
He already pays half, Grandpa.

899
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:19,120
他在这也住了一阵子了  对吧
Well, he's been here for a while, you know?

900
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,140
他又不是我们的家人
And he is not exactly family.

901
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,010
我想他应该知道
I think he knows that.

902
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,660
但愿如此
Let's hope so.

903
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,000
你叮叮咣咣地在干什么
What's all this noise up in here?

904
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,180
我在收拾东西
I'm just packing some stuff.

905
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,000
要做个项目
It's for a project.

906
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,320
什么时候开始的
Since when?

907
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,150
我们都还没讨论过人物呢
I mean, we haven't even talked about the characters yet.

908
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:43,000
你知道我有多喜欢这部分
You know how much I like that.

909
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,600
这个  我还在修改
Yeah, well... I'm still working on it.

910
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,130
情节还没设定好
Don't quite have a plot yet.

911
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,350
我们可以来个头脑风暴
Well, we can brainstorm a little bit.

912
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,300
我觉得这是我们最擅长的
You know, that's where I think we the best at.

913
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,630
我们的头脑风暴
When we brainstorming.

914
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:01,960
我觉得这次我要自己头脑风暴了
I think I gotta brainstorm this one by myself right now.

915
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,820
但是过一阵可以跟你讨论
But I'd love to talk about it soon.

916
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,060
准备好了吗  兄弟
You 'bout ready, bro?

917
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,140
那...
Well, um...

918
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:23,360
不管是什么项目
Whatever it is, uh...

919
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,360
我都为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

920
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:33,940

Wow, look at him.

What type of shoes are those?

922
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,910
你真该摇摆起来  哥们
Yeah, you should start rocking like that, bra-bra.

923
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,450
你那是什么破帽子  吉米
What the fuck is up with your hat, Jimmie?

924
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,030
你看着就像个会走路的烟头  真受不了
You look like a human cigarette, I can't handle it.

925

926
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,170
黑人爱丽丝梦游仙境

927
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,320
蒙特  听说你那根小老二

946
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,040
吉米  两个大男人怎么会做这种事

吉米  吉米  回家去吧
Jimmie! Jimmie! Go home!

960
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,500
你竟然在画他们
You're really drawing them?

961
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,520
他们就会满嘴喷粪
They just talk shit.

962
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,670
我刚认识你的时候你也满嘴喷粪
Well, you talked shit when I met you.

963
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,520
是吗
I did?

964
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,500
是啊
You did.

965
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:32,960
不过没关系
It's fine, though.

966
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,240
那你为什么还跟我玩
Why'd you hang out with me, then?

967
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,840
你是个有心的人  我喜欢你
You care about things. I liked you.

968
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:50,840
你真的不在乎别人说的话吗
You really don't give a fuck what anybody says?

969
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,080
因为他们对我刻薄我就不能喜欢他们了吗
I shouldn't get to appreciate them 'cause they're mean to me?

970
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:01,100
太傻了
That's silly.

971
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,810
你怎么在这
What are you doing here?

972
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,800
你又是为什么在这
What are you ever doing here?

973
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,900
你不是搬出去了吗
Didn't you move out, though?

974
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,220
是啊
Yeah.

975

他们把锁都换了
They changed the fuckin' locks on me.

976
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,830
我很遗憾  真糟糕
I'm sorry, that sucks.

977
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,820
你想怎样  伙计
What do you want, man?

978
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:31,560
你要在这里待多久
How long you gonna be here?

979
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:34,020
我还没想好
I don't know yet.

980
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,730
我只是想试着...
I'm just tryin' to...

981
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,840
放手
Let go.

982
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,720

我们明天再来好了
I guess we'll just come back tomorrow then.

984
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:47,250
好极了
Great.

985
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,210
真不错
That's nice.

986
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,650
走吧  吉姆  我们回我家
Come on, Jim, we'll go to my house.

987
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,450
这座城市在发疯  而你还在这里

你就这么放过他了

1069
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,370
那可怜的孩子和他的朋友们
That poor boy and his friends.

1070

我很遗憾  吉米

我知道这听起来有点怪  但是
I know it sounds weird, but...

1083
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,570
我感觉本来出事的有可能是我
I kinda feel like that could've been me.

1084
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:46,990
如果不是因为有房子的话
If not for the house.

1085
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,720
我想回家
Man, I wanna go home.

1086
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:26,450
肮脏腥臭的咸水
Filthy, fishy salt water.

1087
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:32,290
这片水域已经又脏又臭五十年了
Water been funkier than the Devil's mouth for 50 years.

1088
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:34,790
现在他们想起来清理了

我觉得不是她干的

1110
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,920
没有  需要有吗

1111
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:49,470
不  不需要
No. Not necessarily.

1112
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,470
你心里有大概的房价范围吗
Do you have a price range in mind?

1113
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:52,970
我心里有一栋房子
I have a house in mind.

1114
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:59,190
我想它已经上市了对吗
It's on the market, I assume?

1115
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,190
他们开价多少
How much are they asking?

1116

我没那么多钱
I wouldn't have that.

1121
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,630
可以理解
That's understandable.

1122
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,800
想买下那种房子是很困难的
It's going to be hard to land a place like that.

1123

I'm not rich.

1128
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:49,320
我来这里之前心里就有数了
I came here knowing all that.

1129
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,200
但我们现实一点  你也有指标要完成
But let's be real, you also got a quota to meet.

1130
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,570
我不是说你是个掠夺者  先生
Now I'm not calling you a predator... Sir.

1131
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,620
但你也想赚钱
But you're trying to make your money.

1132
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,410
所以让我帮你吧  先生
So let me help you do that. Sir.

1133
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,120
{\an8}不是这样办事的
That's not the way this works.

1134
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,120
你可以给我随便开价
You can give me whatever deal you gotta give me.

1135
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,620
我不在乎
I don't care what it is.

1136
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,790
因为不像那些违约的人
'Cause unlike all the other people that default,

1137
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,210
这是我唯一想要的房子
this is the only house I'll ever want.

1138
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:10,720
所以我绝不会拖欠每月的账单
So I'll never miss a monthly bill, ever.

1139
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,050
{\an8}我完全理解你的感受  先生
I completely understand how you feel, sir.

1140
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,050
你可以给我开最高的利率
You can give me your highest interest rate.

1141
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,510
你可以给我开最高的利率  好吗
You can give me your highest interest rate, okay?

1142
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,720
-随便坑我  -不  我完全...
- Fuck... Fuck me. - No, I completely...

1143
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:17,850
你甚至都不需要良心不安
You don't even have to feel bad.

1144
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:19,350
你甚至都不需要良心不安
You don't even have to feel bad.

1145
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,900
好吗  我会还上每一分钱
Okay? I will pay back every single cent.

1146
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,230
我很抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, sir.

1147
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,400
我会还上每一分钱
I will pay back every single cent.

1148
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,570
好吧  好吧  你赢了
Okay, okay, you win!

1149
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:38,200
好吧  归你了
Okay, yep, it's yours.

1150
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,080
你这个迷人的混蛋  好吧
You charming bastard, okay.

1151
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,370
以后再聊  再见
Talk to you soon, buh-bye.

1152
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,920
最近怎样  兄弟
How's it going, man?

1153
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,540
还不错  先生
Fine, sir.

1154
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,630
我注意到我们谈过房子正在出售
I noticed the house we discussed is now for sale.

1155
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,630
你的宣传单里有些严重的漏洞
There are some alarming elements in your literature

1156
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,390
我认为你可能想知道
I thought you would like to know.

1157
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,020
房地产总局肯定也想知道
And certainly the Bureau of Real Estate would.

1158
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:06,520
这上面说从房子里能看到金门大桥
This claims the property has a view of the Golden Gate.

1159
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,270
我觉得这不是真的
Which... I don't think is true.

1160
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,780
这不对  这不是真的
Well, it isn't. It isn't true.

1161
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,860
它还说它有原装的
It also claims to have all the original

1162
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,700
"室内设备  地板  和水龙头"
"fixtures, floors, and faucets."

1163
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,620
这也不是真的
Isn't true.

1164
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,830
还有你打算公开没有化粪池的事实吗
And are you planning on disclosing that there's no septic tank?

1165
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,540
这意味着
Which means, any day now,

1166
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,210
花园随时可能被屎淹没
the garden could be flooded with shit.

1167
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,760
你想说什么  伙计
Where's this going, man?

1168
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,390
这些加在一起算得上是虚假广告
All this together seems like false advertisement.

1169
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,390
能构成交易作废
Which is grounds for void a sale.

1170
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:41,510
有可能吊销房产经纪执照
Potential revoke of license.

1171
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,180
我想到了可能是你们
I thought it might've been you guys.

1172
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,610
你想怎么样
What's your deal, man?

1173
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:51,940
我不想怎么样
Don't have a deal.

1174
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:55,900
听着
Look...

1175
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,450
即使不是我  这层楼也会有别人
Somebody on this floor would've gotten that house

1176
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,780
拿下那栋房子
if it wasn't me.

1177
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,330
至少我是本地人  好吗
At least I'm from here, right?

1178
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:08,210
-我把你们的东西放在路边是好意  -好吧
- I put your stuff on the street as a favor. - Okay.

1179
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:09,620
我本来可以把东西拖走
I could've had it trucked away,

1180
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:10,830
但我给你们留了下来了
but I left it out for you.

1181
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,630
听着  混蛋
Look, dick wad.

1182
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:14,920
我不是在唬人  我会举报你的
I'm not fucking around, I will report you.

1183
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:15,840
举报什么呢
For what?

1184
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,340
挂出了能看到桥景  有室内设施的广告吗
Listing a view of the bridge? And fixtures?

1185
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,600
大家都这么干
Everybody does that.

1186
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,720
那玩意其实是我复制粘贴的
I literally copy-pasted that shit.

1187
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,980
关于那栋房子的历史  你在骗人
Well, you're lying about the history of the house.

1188
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:27,730
-我没有骗人  -你有
- I'm not lying about that. - Yes, you are!

1189
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:30,520
你说它是在一百年前建的  比实际时间要早
You say it was built one hundred years earlier than it actually was.

1190
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,900
听着  这不是我编的
Look, I'm not making this up.

1191
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,150
就是你编的
Yes, you are!

1192
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,980
1946年詹姆斯·菲尔斯建了这栋房子
James Fails built this house in 1946.

1193
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,780
-詹姆斯  -菲尔斯
- James? - Fails!

1194
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,400
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1195
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,490
听着  伙计
Look, man.

1196
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,120
1857年的信托契约
Deed of Trust, 1857.

1197
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,250
建筑师吉尔胡利什么的
Architect Gil-hoo-ley, some shit.

1198
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,050
九十年代的时候  你说的菲尔斯没保住房子
Your guy Fails lost it in the '90s.

1199
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,340
看  就在这写着
See, right there.

1200
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,050
听着  伙计
Look, man.

1201
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,930
如果你们需要一周时间来另找住处
If you need a week to find somewhere else,

1202
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,050
那就先住在那里
then take it.

1203
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,260
但是...
But...

1204
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,270
别跟我扯那些占屋者权利的屁话
Don't go pulling some squatters rights shit on me, man.

1205
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:09,850
我有你的信件
I got your mail.

1206
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,190
我知道你的名字
I know your name.

1207
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,570
我不想搞到报警
I don't want to call the cops.

1208
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,320
我不想对你这么做
I don't want to do that to you.

1209
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,460
你去哪了
Where'd you go?

1210
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,540
不重要  兄弟
Doesn't matter, bro.

1211
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,960
我把所有东西都搬进来了
I got everything inside.

1212
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,670
除了沙发
Except the couch.

1213
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,050
那玩意差点砸在我身上
That shit almost fell on me.

1214
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,480
吉姆
Jim...

1215
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:34,100
我和房产经纪人谈过了
I spoke to the realtor.

1216
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,810
让他去死吧
Yeah, fuck that guy.

1217
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,740
他会把我们赶出去
He's gonna throw us out.

1218
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,620
最终还会报警
And eventually call the cops.

1219
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,620
我不知道我们还能坚持这样多久
I don't know how much longer we can keep doing this.

1220
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:56,000
如果你不能坚持  我理解
I understand if you can't.

1221
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,840
我真的理解
I do.

1222
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,760
但我不会走的
But I'm not leaving.

1223
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,180
-吉姆  他说你爷...  -我要去哪呢
- Jim, he said your grand... - Where am I gonna go?

1224
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,560
我爸住在单人房里
My dad's in the SRO.

1225
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,610
我姑姑远在鸟不拉屎的地方
My aunt's out in bum fuck.

1226
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:20,820
我妈...
My mom...

1227
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:25,110
我根本不知道我妈在哪
Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

1228
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,580
我不走
I'm not leaving, bro.

1229
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:35,250
我是最后一个人了
I'm the last one left.

1230
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,090
我们可以去我家
We have my house.

1231
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,600
我不能回去那里  兄弟
I can't go back there, bro.

1232
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:55,850
蒙特
Mont,

1233
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,560
这栋房子...
this house...

1234
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,570
这就是我该做的
This is what I do.

1235
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,820
这是我们该做的  蒙特
It's what we do, Mont.

1236
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,660
这是属于我们的
This is our shit.

1237
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,950
我们现在不能放弃
We can't give up now.

1238
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:11,910
我们必须抗争
We gotta fight.

1239
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,830
对吗
Right?

1240
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,540
对
Yeah.

1241
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,340
我支持你  兄弟
I'm with you, bro.

1242
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,760
你总是支持我
You always been with me.

1243
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:56,790
你在写东西吗
Shit, you're writing?

1244
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,290
嗯
Yeah.

1245
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,790
我觉得我想出了一部戏
I think I cracked a play.

1246
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,420
我想下周演  如果可以的话
I'd like to put it on next week, if that's all right?

1247
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:12,050
太好了  搞起来  兄弟
Hell, yeah, get it, bro!

你怎么穿得像个白人男孩
Why are you dressed like a white boy?

1276
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,620
是为了你们的小演出吗
It's for your little show, huh?

1277
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,640
天呐

没有
No.

1283
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:15,380
我不在乎椅子  孩子
I don't care about the chair, son.

1284
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:19,880
不过手脚轻点

继续
Carry on.

1287
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:07,270
我爸很讨厌我弹这玩意
My daddy hated when I played that shit.

1288
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:20,110
上来吧  别不好意思
Yeah, come on in, don't be shy.

1289
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,820
这里是他爷爷建的
His grandpa built it.

1290
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,990
对一个黑人来说还不错对吧
Not bad for a black man, huh?

1291
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:27,290
是啊
Oh, no.

1292
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:30,540
很好  非常好
Very good. Very good.

1293
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,800
这应该挺有意思的  真不错
So, this is gonna be interesting. This is nice.

01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,550
-观众也不少  -是啊
- Nice crowd, too. - Yeah.

1295
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:45,680
你靠糖果赚了很多钱吗
You make a lot of money on candy?

1296
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:47,220
卖糖

1297
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,600
-我以前卖过几年  -是吗
- I used to, for years. - Oh, yeah?

1298
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,550
大多数搬进黑人社区的
Most of these new white people that's moving

1299
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,980
这些新白人
in these black neighborhoods,

1300
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,060
他们根本不知道自己正站着的厨房里
they don't even know they standing in the kitchen

1301
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,860
曾经有人被枪击过

1302
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:59,360
我不知道他要演一出戏
I didn't know he was doing a play and shit.

1303
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,270
他只是邀请了我们
He just invited us.

1304
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,360
我不知道他们在搞什么奇怪的玩意
I don't know what weird shit they got goin' on,

1305
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,570
但真的很怪
but it's pretty weird.

1306
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,710
我为什么要打你
What I'mma hit you for?

1307
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:19,920
我们一家的
You my folks.

1308
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:26,000
好吧  好吧
All right. All right.

1309
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,970
但我受不了身边有软弱的家伙
But I can't have soft niggas hanging around me.

1310
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:35,690

你这个软蛋
You soft, nigga.

They gonna call you a bitch at your funeral.

1320
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:03,600
我不是孬种

科菲有方方面面
Kofi had dimensions.

1362

一个帖子不足以反映  一出话剧不足以捕捉

庆祝他过往的人生

1365
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:23,670
不是通过那些嗓门最大的人
Not through those who speak the loudest.

1366
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:26,180
而是通过他留给我们的记忆

你怎么回忆科菲
How will you remember Kofi?

1370
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:47,270
我侄女刚搬来这里时
He, you know, he used to come and walk my niece

1371
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:50,340
他常常陪她放学回家
home from school when she first moved up here.

1372
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:53,200
他是个小绅士  差不多吧
He was a little gentleman, or whatnot,

1373
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,680
很贴心...
you know, sweet, um...

1374
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:58,540
实在悲伤
It's just sad.

1375
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:04,720
我训练科菲打波普·华纳橄榄球赛
I coached Kofi in Pop Warner.

1376
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,530
他总留下来帮我整理
He stayed behind and helped me pack up.

1377
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,150
每天都是
Every day.

1378
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:11,370
是的
Yeah.

1379
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:15,270
你呢  年轻人
And how 'bout you, young man?

1380
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:22,740
见鬼
Shit, man.

1381
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:25,280
我不知道
I don't know.

1382
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,410
我把他逼得太紧了吗
Did I push him too hard?

1383
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:33,040
科菲是我兄弟
Kofi was my nigga, man.

1384
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,410
我逼他太紧了吗
Did I push him too hard?

1385
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,960
你呢
How 'bout you?

1386
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,460
好吧
Well...

1387
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,800
我对科菲最后的记忆
My last memory of Kofi

1388
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,370
是他对我满嘴喷粪
was him talking shit to me.

1389
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,950
他说了一些我听过的
He said some of the most fucked-up shit

1390
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:10,900
最操蛋的话
anybody's ever said to me.

1391
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,600
但科菲也曾
But Kofi also got jumped

1392
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,410
因在教养院帮我跟大孩子对峙而被突袭
for defending me against the older kids in the group home.

1393
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,750
他不喜欢打架
He didn't like to fight,

1394
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:25,330
但他那时为了我打架
but he fought for me then.

1395
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,250
人不止一面
People aren't one thing.

1396
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:40,900
听听
That.

1397
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,380
所有...所有这些
All... all of it.

1398
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,410
如果科菲能够
What would have happened

1399
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,150
表现自己
if Kofi could've

1400
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,770
会发生什么
showed himself?

1401
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:02,670
他各方面的自己
All forms of himself.

1402
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:06,580
世界
The world

1403
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:10,520
把他困在一个盒子里
put him in a box!

1404
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:13,620
而他从未
And he never

1405
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:15,840
推开盒子
pushed beyond it.

1406

让我们来
Let us.

1407
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:25,080
让我们打破盒子
Let us break the boxes!

1408
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,590
让我们给彼此勇气
Let us give each other the courage!

1409
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:30,190
去...去看
To... to see!

1410
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,690
看我们的出身之外的世界
Beyond the stories we are born into!

1411
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:36,430
让我们所有人
Let us all

1412
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:39,190
好好看看
really look

1413

1417
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:01,040
一个真正的幸存者  吉米
A true survivor. Jimmie!

1418
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,130
你住过多少地方
How many places have you lived?

1419
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:05,100
如果他们明天把你赶出去
And if they kicked you out tomorrow,

1420
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:08,070
你还是这样的人
you would still be all those things!

1421
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,970
你的存在超越...
You exist beyond the...

1422
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:13,270
这些墙  你超越你的...
these walls, you extend beyond your...

1423
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:15,190
你的祖先
your... your forefathers!

1424
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,160
你超越这个房子
You are more than this house!

1425
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,660
吉米  你不是这些...这些墙
Jimmie, you are not these... these walls!

1426
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,700
你不是这些地板  你不是这个天花板
You're not these floors, you're not this ceiling!

1427
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,280
-该让你知道了  -兄弟  你在做什么
- It's time you know! - Bro, what are you doing?

1428
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,690
-你在做什么  -是时候了
- What are you doing? - It is time!

1429
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,660
-该让你知道了  -我不需要知道
- It is time you know! - I don't need to know,

1430
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:29,510
我不需要知道  停下  停下
I don't need to know. Let's stop. Let's stop.

1431
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,750
-吉米  你不...  -够了  停下
- Jimmie... You don't! - Enough, stop!

1432
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:36,210
-停下好吗  蒙特  -吉米
- Please, stop. Mont! - Jimmie!

1433
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,770
-这房子不是你爷爷建的  -够了
- Your grandpa didn't build this house! - Enough!

1434
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:44,950
不是他建的  吉米
He didn't build it, Jimmie!

1435
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:55,940
是他建的
Yes, he did.

1436
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:01,050
-这房子是他建的  -不是他  我看到了
- He built this house! - He didn't, I saw it, man,

1437
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:02,430
我看到了契约
I saw the deed.

1438
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,570
我看到了
I saw it.

1439
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,930
不知道那是什么情况
I don't know what the hell that thing was.

1440
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:57,990
然后他左勾拳
Then he shoots a left.

1441
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:02,950
让他们走吧
Man, let 'em leave.

1442
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:05,390
反正他们也不配待在这里
They don't deserve to be in here anyway.

1443
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:11,790
我们也不配
Neither do we.

1444
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,360
你真的要听
You gonna really listen to what

1445
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,610
另一个黑人给你说的真相吗
another-ass nigga tell you what's true?

1446
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:24,340
拜托  杰博  挺起脊梁
Come on, Jayboe, get your spine up, son.

1447
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:27,200
-多些骄傲  -我一直在那么做
- Have some pride, man. - I've been doin'.

1448
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:36,980
但是你说出来吧
But you say it.

1449
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:39,880
说什么
Say what?

1450
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,670
真相
The truth.

1451
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,640
什么
What?

1452
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,420
这房子不是爷爷建的
That grandpa didn't build this house.

1453
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:52,940
老天  不要相信那些胡说八道
Man, get outta here with that bullshit.

1454
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:54,520
拜托  杰博
Come on, Jayboe.

1455
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,110
说吧
Just say it.

1456
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,130
我说不出来
Can't tell you shit.

1457
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,600
我要走了
I'm outta here, man.

1458
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:25,530
你愿意信就信吧
You sit in that bullshit if you want.

1459
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:57,270
杰博
Jayboe.

1460
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,340
这么久以来我一直跟人说是他建的
I been telling people he built it for so long.

1461
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:15,670
差点忘了这不是真的
Almost forgot it wasn't true.

1462
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:23,180
这曾是我们的
This was ours.

1463
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,010
然后又不是了
And then it wasn't.

1464
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,540
所以你只是告诉自己一些话
So you just tell yourself what you need

1465
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,830
让你感觉这仍是我们的
to make you feel like it still is.

1466
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,030
见鬼
Shit.

1467
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,650
我也是一样
I did it, too.

1468
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:45,670
会让你觉得
It makes you feel

1469
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:48,430
与众不同
special.

1470
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,410
但你现在有机会
But you got a chance to get out

1471
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:55,770
抛开这一切了
from underneath all of that now.

1472
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:59,370
我不想
I don't want to.

1473
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:03,090
我只想要这房子
I just want it.

1474
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,560
这是你真正想要的吗
Is that what you really want?

1475
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:15,590
下半辈子都为此努力
To spend the rest of your life working for this?

1476
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,330
为此奋斗吗
Fighting for this?

1477
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:26,100
我相信你能把这里变成自己的
I believe that you could make this place yours.

1478
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,390
我真的相信
I really do.

1479
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:36,520
但是如果你离开
But if you leave

1480
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,530
也不是你的损失
it's not your loss.

1481
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:46,390
是旧金山的损失
It's San Francisco's.

1482
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,150
去它的旧金山
Fuck San Francisco.

1483
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:39,040
-这个城市太逊了  -逊爆了
- This city blows. - Big time.

1484
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:40,950
我是说  我不介意
I mean, whatever, I'm not above

1485
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:43,540
住在从前的毒品屋里
living in a former crack house, you know?

1486
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:46,100
但是我来这里是为了珍妮丝和飞机乐队
But, I came here for Janis and the Airplane,

1487
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:48,500
不是为了在该死的初创公司工作
not to work at a fucking startup.

1488
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,350
姐们  我说了几个月了
Dude, I've been saying for months,

1489
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,050
我们搬去东洛杉矶吧
let's just move to East LA.

1490
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:53,510
这个城市已经死了
This city's dead.

1491
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:55,230
不
Nah.

1492
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:57,240
说真的  这城市见鬼去吧
Seriously, fuck this city.

1493
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,100
打扰一下
'Scuse me?

1494
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:05,460
你们不能恨旧金山
You don't get to hate San Francisco.

1495
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:10,140
你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

1496
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,700
是啊  老兄
Yeah, dude, I mean...

1497
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,910
不好意思  但我想恨什么就恨什么
Sorry, but I'll hate what I want.

1498
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,520
你们爱这里吗
Do you love it?

1499
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:23,470
是啊  我住在这里
It's... I mean yeah, I'm here.

1500
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,720
但我一定要爱这里吗
But do I have to love it?

1501
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:29,220
没有爱就不能恨
You don't get to hate it unless you love it.

1502
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:34,500
典型的公交破事
Classic Muni shit.

1503
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:46,070
谁赢钱了  快点  快点
Who call the money man, come on now, hurry up.

1504
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,730
注意点
Pay attention!

1505
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,490
亚历山大大帝是个黑人
Alexander the Great was a black man.

1506
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:55,010
邪恶的教育体系里不会教这个
They don't teach you that in the devil school system.

1507
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:59,730
这破日子我一天也忍不下去了
I can't take another day of this bullshit.

1508
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:08,560
吉姆
Jim.

1509
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:16,700
很抱歉我那么做了
I'm sorry I did that.

1510
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,700
那是个愚蠢的话剧
It was a stupid play.

1511
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:25,160
不
Nah.

1512
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:29,060
很抱歉我没告诉你真相
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

1513
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:34,810
我只是希望那是真的
I just wanted it to be true.

1514
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:38,540
那感觉特别好  你知道吗
It felt so good, you know?

1515
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,670
没事的
It's okay.

1516
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:06,750
吉米
Jimmie.

1517
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,280
你饿吗
Are you hungry?

1518
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:10,920
饿死了
Fucking starving.

1519
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:17,120
他放弃了
He's giving up.

1520
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:20,230
我忍不下去了
I can't take no more.

1521
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,670
他崩溃了
He's breaking down.

1522
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,930
他真的把这公寓拆了个底朝天
He's really tearing this apartment apart.

1523
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,820
不过这看着让人激动
This looks exciting though, you know?

1524
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,680
-没错  是的  -是吗  真的吗
- Yeah. Yeah, it is. - Yeah? Oh, yeah?

1525
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:37,490
我现在懂了
I got it now.

1526
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:39,620
他看起来很饥渴之类的
He seems like he's horny or something.

1527
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:47,370
他又在砸门了
He's banging on the door again.

1528

你好  威尔
Hi, Will.

1530
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:24,970
我今天要出发去旧金山
I'm leaving for San Francisco today,

1531
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:26,050
不过我大约一周后回来
but I'll be back in about a week,

1532
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:27,740
到时候我会帮你处理的
I'll take care of it for you then.

1533
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:28,850
他可真刻薄  不是吗
Sure is a scorcher, isn't it

1534
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:30,130
我见过他更刻薄的样子
Well, I've seen him worse.

1535
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:31,470
祝你愉快  伯特
Well have a nice time, Bert.

1536
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:33,940
-谢了  -你为什么不...
- Yeah, thanks. - Why don't you...
