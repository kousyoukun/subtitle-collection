1
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,457
杰思敏
Jasmine?

2
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,090
杰思敏 我们要迟到了 快点
Jasmine! We gonna be late, come on.

3
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:21,088
走吧
Let's go.

4
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,257
为什么他们穿着这些衣服 我们却没有
Why do they have on these suits and we don't?

5
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:27,222
我们眼前发生了这么多事情
Something's going on right in our face.

6
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:29,389
你们却沉迷在iPhone中
You're so stuck on those iPhones,

7
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:31,788
或者J phone 12之类的手机里
J phone 12s or whatever,

8
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,657
都爆炸吧
blow up in your hand.

9
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,255
你们百度不到发生了什么
You can't Google what's going on right now.

10
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:40,291
你们关心吗
Are y'all paying attention?

11
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,822
我们都没穿这些衣服 他们又何须穿
Why do they have on these suits if we don't?

12
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:47,191
为什么
Why?

13
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,557
他们到这来清理水源啦
They here to clean this water?

14
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:54,488
这水比魔鬼的嘴巴都脏
When this water been dirtier than the Devil's mouth

15
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,154
已有50年了
for 50 years.

16
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,224
现在他们想要清理啦
And now they want to clean it?

17
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:00,720
他们都计划好了 兄弟
They got plans for us, man.

18
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:03,521
似乎是乔治•杰特森（美漫《飞出个未来》里的角色）拒绝了
Looking like George Jetson rejects.

19
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,791
因为他们都虚弱
'Cause they weak!

20
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:07,221
虚弱的心
Weak hearts!

21
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:09,189
虚弱的肺
Weak lungs!

22
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:11,724
没有了面罩不能呼吸
Can't even breathe up here without a mask.

23
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:18,657
但是我们在地狱里被锤炼过了
But we was put through Hell to be purified.

24
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:23,289
各位兄弟姐妹 你们知道我的意思
You know what I'm sayin', brothers and sisters?

25
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:26,255
哥们 在监狱里他们对黑鬼可是很疯狂的
Man, it's crazy what jail will do to a nigga.

26
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:28,254
他们不在乎什么水 兄弟
They don't care about they water, man,

27
00:02:28,256 --> 00:02:29,520
一定是有什么事发生了
there's something going on,

28
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:31,288
我们会查清楚的
we gonna get to the bottom of it.

29
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,754
幸好我现在是个传教士
And they lucky I'm a man of God right now.

30
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:35,754
你觉得他会为这个每天早晨排练吗
You think he rehearses this every morning?

31
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,387
否则他们早就把这双手拷走了
Or they would catch these hands.

32
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:40,754
看起来更像是即兴的
Seems a bit more impromptu.

33
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:42,620
已经2019年了
2019 out here!

34
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:44,322
他们还没出生时
We been yellin' about this water

35
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:46,125
我们就在为这水的事情呼喊了
since before they were born.

36
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,258
他们还没出生就开始了
Before they were born!

37
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:53,822
这趟公交车哪去了 我们去不了了
Where's this bus, man? We're not gonna make it.

38
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,288
你们会把我们独留在地狱
Y'all leave us the hell alone.

39
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,521
除非你们给予援手
Unless y'all really here to help us.

40
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:00,254
我们终将胜利
We'll get there.

41
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,787
他们在背后都谋划好了 兄弟
They got plans for us, man.

42
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,289
我们去不了了 
We're not gonna make it, bro.

43
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,521
不是为你和我
Not for you and me.

44
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:05,655
请大家一定要
So I urge you!

45
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:07,691
为你们的土地抗争
Fight for your land!

46
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,188
为你们的家庭抗争
Fight for your home!

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,191
- 为你们... - 我们踩着滑板去吧
- Fight for your... - Let's skate.

48
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:27,591
知道这里是哪吗
This here?

49
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:31,554
这里是边境 兄弟
This is the edge, bro!

50
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:35,555
上帝临幸的最后一片土地
The final frontier of Manifest Destiny.

51
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:37,124
城市的边缘
Last edge of the city.

52
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:40,289
哥们 多走两步
Man, two steps further,

53
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,557
你们就能喝到那肮脏的盐水
you'll be drinking that filthy saltwater.

54
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,587
但是我们建造了这些轮船
But we built these ships.

55
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,721
挖掘的这些河道
Dredged these canals.

56
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:52,225
洛杉矶的人们从来都不知道这些
In the San Francisco they never knew existed.

57
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,791
然而现在他们想来开发了
And now they come to build something new?

58
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:11,591
所有的街区一半是过去的样子 一半却是未来的模样
Whole blocks half in the past, half in the future.

59
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:17,555
你们应该去洛杉矶闯一闯
But should you venture into their San Francisco,

60
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,757
他们掠夺的黄金都在那里
the one they pillaged for gold!

61
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,321
在那虚伪的城市里
Remember your truth!

62
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:25,424
不要忘记真理所在
In the city of facades.

63
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:37,079
带我一起去吧
Take me with you!

64
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:39,046
嘿 嘿
Hey! Hey!

65
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,079
带我一起去 哥们
Take me with you, man!

66
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,412
别走 我们要去哪
Come on, where are we going?

67
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:46,246
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

68
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:48,683
等一下 我来了 我来了
Come on, I'm coming! I'm coming!

69
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,747
看看他们 看看你们
Look at them look at you.

70
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:59,582
真瞧不起你们
Look down at you.

71
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:02,282
我们建造了所有的东西
But we built them!

72
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:05,215
我们与这些房子同在
We are these homes!

73
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,349
它们注视着
Their eyes...

74
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:11,015
那伸出的房檐
Their pointed brims...

75
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,549
我们形影不离
We move if they move.

76
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,982
木料被我们的汗水浸透
Our sweat soaked in the wood.

77
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,050
镌刻着我们的身影
Gilded in our image.

78
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,149
这是我们的家
This is our home!

79
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:33,149
我们的家
Our home!

80
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:37,649
我们的家
Our home.

81
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,348
谢谢大家
Thanks.

82
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:49,282
你确定他们走了吗
Are you sure they're gone?

83
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,146
吉姆
Jim?

84
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:06,716
我的意思是他们的车子不在
I mean, their car is gone.

85
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:11,046
我们到后面去看看
Let's check the back, man.

86
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:12,146
早上好
Good morning.

87
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,315
你好
How are you?

88
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,581
还记得那次他们在厨房吗
Remember that time they were in the kitchen?

89
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,515
吉姆
Jim!

90
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,982
还记得吗
Remember the kitchen?

91
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,448
当然
Yeah, sure.

92
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,281
但是 布鲁
But, bruh...

93
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,580
难道我没有跟你提过
Didn't I tell you

94
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,649
这些栅栏不是黑色的 上面长满了长春花
these railings are periwinkle, not black.

95
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:36,648
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

96
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:39,082
我知道
Yeah, I got it.

97
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:42,548
我们不能再每两周就来一次了
We gotta start coming more than every two weeks, bro.

98
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,649
这个该死的花园就像场噩梦
This fuckin' garden's a nightmare.

99
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:23,320
下次我把爷爷的工具带上
I'll bring my grandpa's tools next time.

100
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:24,523
一定要带上
Please do.

101
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,523
墙纸正在剥落
Wallpaper's chipping.

102
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:42,289
这些人正在埋葬这所房子
These people are killing this house.

103
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,321
你又进不去
You're not goin' in though.

104
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:46,391
吉姆
Jim?

105
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:49,057
我是说
I mean...

106
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,755
我是说
I mean...

107
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,025
不行
No?

108
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:57,822
他们肯定走了
They're definitely gone, though.

109
00:08:57,824 --> 00:09:00,388
这次最好快点
Better be quick this time. Hmm?

110
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,424
我知道
Yeah, I know.

111
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,290
需要些时间
Takes time.

112
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:05,554
我知道
Yeah, I know.

113
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:07,388
我随时就位
I'll be at my spot.

114
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,490
好的
All right.

115
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,487
快点
Quick.

116
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,556
好的
Okay.

117
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,087
- 老天 - 亲爱的
- Jesus, man! - Honey.

118
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,787
快滚开
Just get the heck out of here, man.

119
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,554
- 什么鬼 - 他也没伤害谁 玛尔
- What the fuck? - He's not hurting anyone, Mar.

120
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:52,788
哦 那他可以给我们的房子涂漆啦
Oh, he's painting the house now?

121
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,855
呃 嗯
Well, yeah.

122
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:56,454
别再修我的房子了
Stop fixing my house!

123
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:58,555
就快完成了 稍等
I'm almost done, just hold on.

124
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,822
为什么你不去给附近的房子上漆呢
Why don't you just paint the neighbors' houses?

125
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:02,455
他们的更糟糕
Theirs are worse than ours.

126
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:04,188
再稍等一下
Just hold on one second.

127
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,487
我的意思是 从某个方面来说
I mean, we appreciate it,

128
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:07,354
我们很感谢 但是
in some way, but, yeah...

129
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,421
着很奇怪
It's weird, man!

130
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,621
我就快完成了
I'm almost done.

131
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:12,587
听着 我们要报警了
Look, we will call the cops, man.

132
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:14,088
这次我真的要报警了
And I mean it this time.

133
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,288
不 我们不会报警
No, we're not gonna call the cops.

134
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,621
我们不会报警 别再来就行了
We're not calling the cops, just stop coming back.

135
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:21,421
我就快好了 请再稍等一下
I'm almost done, hold on, please, hold on.

136
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:24,320
呃 从我的鸟池边滚开
Ugh! Just get off my fucking birdie bath.

137
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:26,120
不 再
No, just...

138
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:27,321
滚出去
Get outta here, man.

139
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:29,123
- 那些花了我们3美元 - 好的
- Those were $3. - Fine.

140
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,321
下次我再弄完吧
I'll finish it next time.

141
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,754
- 上帝 - 还有下次
- God! - Next time?

142
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:34,221
哦 从...
Oh, just get...

143
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:35,688
从我的鸟池边滚开
Get the heck off my birdie bath!

144
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,490
记得给后面的绿植浇点水 或者让我来也行
Just water the plants in the back or I will.

145
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:39,788
哦
Oh!

146
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,220

152
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:54,321
你不能再吃外面的鱼了
You really gotta stop eating the fish out there.

153
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:55,855
我觉得还好啊
I think it's fine.

154
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:58,221
所有的鱼体内都有汞
All fish has mercury.

155
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:03,254
我晓得 我还见过带屌的海鸥呢

Well, so I guess it's a male.

157

我才不会做那些狗屎事情
I ain't tryin' do that bullshit...

162
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:19,754
在我把那坨屎甩在你脸上之前 赶紧给我停手
Stop playin' before I slap the shit out your face.

163
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:21,253
把你的屁眼闭上吧 黑鬼

00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,388
- 最近怎么样啊 兄弟 - 大家好啊
- What's good, brother? - What's up with y'all?

169
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,253
嘿 我昨天去Moms知道吗
Hey, you know I seen Moms last night, right?

170
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,520
她就像是在顶点
She was looking like she was

171
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:34,587
有点迷了
missing a little bit on the top.

172
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:37,188
我是说我们用一样的水洗澡 吉姆
I mean we shower in the same water, Jim.

173
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,023
现在黑鬼们都要一起洗澡了吗
So niggas takin' showers together now?

174
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,657
可能已经洗过了
Probably was.

175
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,323
那可太古怪了
That's fruity.

176
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:55,454
我在跟他讲不要吃鱼
I was trying to tell him not to eat the fish,

177
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:57,187
因为水有毒
because the water is toxic.

178
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,620
呃 当然了 
Well, duh.

179
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:00,721
因为他们在哪里造了个
That's 'cause they built the atomic bomb

221
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,089
我尿在他们的桌子上怎么样

222

闯进去

224
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,457
然后尿在那个傻逼小黄桌上
all over that stupid little yellow table?

225
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:10,423
那会毁了地板吧
Wouldn't that ruin the floors?

226
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:14,557
有道理
Yeah, I guess you got a point there.

你就会说些这吗
That's all you gotta say?

295
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:24,486
该怎么办?逃跑吗?
Man, what I'm supposed to do, take off?

296
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:26,154
该怎么办?逃跑吗?
I don't care about none of that shit.

297
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,686
我知道 我只是不知道该说什么
I know, I just ain't got nothin' else to say.

298
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,154
说白了

天哪 公交车哪去了
Oh, my God, where is this bus?

321

要是你再不把你那穿着好时衬衫的老父亲带上车的话
Man, if you don't get your up the father from Good Times shirt-wearing ass

328
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:42,189
车还是老样子
Yep, I like what you and your dad did with it.

329
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,453
以至于带着开出来?

By hisself.

Okay.

336
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:02,554
我跟他说你得养只狗或猫
I told him you need to get you a cat or a dog,

337
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:04,423
或者女人啥的也行

338
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,088
他独守空房
He's home alone...

339
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,686
嗯 没在房子里 但还是一个人
Well, he ain't at home, but he's alone.

340
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:12,121
一个人流浪
He's alone with no home.

341
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:17,520
你不也一个人住在车里
Well, you live in a car by yourself.

342
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:20,420
是 但是我不寂寞

00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:31,390
你上次和你爸一起是什么时候
When the last time you hung out with your daddy?

347
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:39,787
几周前吧 不确定

见鬼
Shit.

350
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,686
人们生孩子就是
That's what... That's what people have kids for,

351
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:50,154
想要个伴
so they can have some companionship!

352
00:22:50,156 --> 00:22:52,219
想要个伴
Somebody to hang out with.

353
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:54,188
所以我才没要孩子
That's why I ain't had no kids.

354
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,387
我乐得清静
'Cause I don't wanna be bothered.

355
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:58,319
你爸不想要这辆车
Your daddy don't want this fuckin' car, man.

356
00:22:58,321 --> 00:22:59,854

那是不是萨沃伊别墅?
Wasn't that the Savoy House?

358
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,286
以前是

00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:08,090
有100个混蛋在那里住过 还有租金管控
It was 100 motherfuckers in there, rent-controlled.

360
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,722
他们以为自己拥有了这所房子
They thought they owned that shit.

361
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:16,619
领主把他们都烧死了
The landlord burned all of the people outta there.

362
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,453
因为 吉米
'Cause see, Jimmie,

363
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:20,322
你从来不会拥有什么
you never really own shit.

364
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:23,719
这车不是我的
This car ain't mine.

365
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:26,590
这车不是我的
But it never was yours.

366
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:35,656
你决不会拥有它
You never own shit!

367
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:44,753
什么鬼
What the fuck?

她在搬家

374
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:21,253
和她姐姐争得像个疯子一样
Fighting like crazy with her sister.

375
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:23,454
家里有人死了的时候
When someone dies in the family,

376
00:24:23,456 --> 00:24:25,453
白人都要这么做
that's what white people do.

377
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:28,821
这是她的 这是他的 这是我的
This is for her, this is for him, this is mine.

378
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:30,519
房子是谁的?
Who's gonna have the house?

379
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:32,553
这房子不再是他们的了?
So they lost the house?

380
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,590
房子会归谁?
Who's gonna possess the house?

381
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:39,623
他们就争啊 争啊 争啊
They're just fighting, and fighting, and fighting.

382
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:52,789
他们就争啊 争啊 争啊
What's gonna happen to it now?

383
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:04,522
为什么她妈妈死了他们就得搬出来
Why'd they have to move out 'cause her mom died?

384
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:07,655
不知道
I don't know.

385
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:10,853
他们没有什么品位
They were tasteless,

386
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:13,386
但至少不会糟蹋房子
but at least they didn't fuck it up.

387
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,854
亲爱的 10美元
Well, that will be $10, hun.

388
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:17,554
从什么时候开始10美元的
Since when?

389
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:20,419
从你吃上最好的60特趣开始
Since that's the best deal you're gonna get on 60 Twix.

390
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:23,252
我没说60 阿姨 我说的是16
I didn't say 60 Twix, Auntie. I said 16.

391
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:25,255
我怎么会吃60的
How I'm gonna eat 60 Twix?

392
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,719
我又不了解你
I don't know your life.

393
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:30,087
搞得跟好事多超市一样
You act like you in Costco or something like that.

394
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:31,619
你这里又不是好事多
You ain't Costco.

395
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,654
嘿 你要是想去好事多 就去啊
Hey, you can go to Costco if you need to.

396
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:35,653

403
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,420
我们对一所房子挺感兴趣的
Yeah, we're curious about a house

404
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:57,120
在金门费尔摩附近

414
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:17,853
我在去学校的路上
I used to drive past that house

415
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,486
开车经过那里
on the way to school every day.

416
00:26:19,488 --> 00:26:21,353
哪个学校?
What school did you go to?

417
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:23,152
圣伊格纳斯
I went to St. Ignatius.

418
00:26:23,154 --> 00:26:24,754
你也是那的吗

421

我不确定
Well, I'm not sure.

428
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:42,187
好像是那里的住户和她姐姐
It seems like the owner and her sister

429
00:26:42,189 --> 00:26:43,519
在争房子
are fighting over it.

430
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:45,622
她妈妈好像去世了
But I guess her mom died.

431
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,087
噢 
Ah, man.

432
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:51,586
听起来像是房产事宜
I don't know, that sounds like an estate thing.

433
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:54,056
有点尴尬
That's a sucky situation.

434
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,553
我的意思是
But, I mean...

435
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:58,186
为了那样的一座房子
With a house like that,

436
00:26:58,188 --> 00:27:00,289
她们可能争得数年不休
they could be fighting over that for years.

437
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:02,456
而房子却独自没落
While it just sits there.

438
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,486
有点可惜
It's a pity.

439
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:08,753
房子...真的空无一物吗?
So it's really just... Just empty?

440
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:10,252
糟透了 
It's fucked up, right?

441
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,821
非常糟糕
So fucked up, like I...

442
00:27:11,823 --> 00:27:14,286
烦死人了 街上那么多人
Bothers me, there's all these people in the street

443
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:15,654
这些老旧的大房子
and these big old houses

444
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:18,087
却在吃灰
are just sitting there collecting dust.

445
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,086
话又说回来 又能怎样呢
But shit, what else can you say?

446
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:24,355
太不公平了
The fucking injustice of it!

447
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:27,555
是啊
Yeah.

448
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:42,219
蒙特 我们来了 宝贝
Mont! We here, baby!

449
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,687
他们以重建城市的名义
Spoiling all the fun,

450
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:11,387
夷平了这里
leveling most of this neighborhood

451
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:13,787
破坏了这些美好事物
in the name of Urban Renewal.

452
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:17,152
很抱歉你们没有了家和时髦的店铺
Sorry about your homes and your funky shops.

453
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:19,187
你们可以在停车场前面的
You can set up a shoeshine stand

454
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:21,619
喜互惠超市摆擦鞋摊
in front of the parking lot at Safeway.

455
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:24,119
然而你们这些真诚的人们
But you distinguished truth-seekers

456
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:27,320
却还知道 在一个叫 西部哈莱姆 的地方
want to know about the real hep cats who hung out here,

457
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:29,687
在一个叫 西部哈莱姆 的地方
in the "Harlem of the West,"

458
00:29:29,689 --> 00:29:33,554
就想这座漂亮的房子一样
where a few of these homes did survive.

459
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:35,420
有些房子存活了下来
Like this beauty here,

460
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:38,719
建造于1800年左右
which was built clear back in the 1800s.

461
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:40,454
在黑人来之前
Before the black thing,

462
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:43,386
这都是日本人
this was all Japanese,

463
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:47,120
直到罗斯福的冲锋队把他们赶走
till FDR's stormtroopers rounded them up into camps.

464
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:50,119
这座房子建造于上个世纪四十年代
This house was built in the 1940s.

465
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:54,220
大家和我们的邻居打个招呼
Say hi to our neighbor here, everybody.

466
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:56,120
嗨
Hi.

467
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:59,785
事实上100年之后才会有这种风格
That would actually be about 100 years late for this style.

468
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:02,487
从那金色的镶边可以看出
We can see from his gingerbread trim,

469
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:06,454
是建造于19世纪50年代
this was built sometime in the 1850s.

470
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,754
呃 1946年
Uh, 1946!

471
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:12,686
那我就要和你争一争了 大兄弟
I'm gonna have to disagree with you there, dude man.

472
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:17,152
在那个时候没有建筑师会有这种风格
No architect in the 1940s was building in this style.

473
00:30:17,154 --> 00:30:21,089
在那个时候没有建筑师会有这种风格
That's probably true, but this wasn't built by an architect.

474
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:23,655
是我的爷爷建造的
My grandfather built this.

475
00:30:26,322 --> 00:30:29,252
他在二战的时候来到这里
He came here World War II,

476
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:32,056
圈了这块地 盖了这所房子
he bought this lot and he built this house.

477
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:34,653
楼梯
The stairs.

478
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:36,486
这些窗户
These windows.

479
00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:39,555
柱子 拱门
The columns. The archways.

480
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:41,322
那个巫婆帽
The witch hat.

481
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:43,589
栏杆扶手
The balustrades.

482
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:45,590
那些亮亮的鳞瓦片
The fish scales.

483
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,587
阳台
This balcony.

484
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:51,123
还有那堵可以让你们滚出去的墙
That wall to keep y'all the fuck out.

485
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:54,023
全部
All of it.

486
00:30:55,322 --> 00:30:58,752
都是吉米·菲尔斯 用他的双手建造的
By Jimmie Fails I, with his own two hands.

487
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:00,622
就在1946年
In 1946.

488
00:31:02,422 --> 00:31:03,590
喔
Wow.

489
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,189
挺神奇的
That's pretty amazing.

490
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:09,055
嗯
Well...

491
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:12,120
我们去下一站吧
Let's move on to our next stop.

492
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,120
帕蒂·赫斯特曾任性不出的
The closet Patty Hearst

493
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,419
壁橱 在之前...
willfully hid herself in, before trotting on down...

494
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:20,055
怎么了?发生什么了?
What's good with that? What's going on?

495
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:23,286
感觉像英国的皇帝一样
Feel like the King of England.

496
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:25,087
吉米君王 挥手
King Jimmie. Wave.

497
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,423
跟将军挥手
Wave to the General.

498
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,287
- 嘿 将军 - 像画圈一样
- Hey, General. - Yeah, but it's like a circle,

499
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,487
用你的胳膊肘
with your... With your elbow.

500
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:34,253
然后像用杯子装空气一样
Yeah, and then cup the air.

501
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:35,454
像回事了
That's kind of the thing there.

502
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:37,123
- 哦 对 - 很好
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah, that's good.

503
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,389
这座房子很美 吉米
It's a beautiful house, Jimmie.

504
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,722
比我想象中的还美
More beautiful than I could have imagined.

505
00:32:27,788 --> 00:32:29,155
是啊
Yeah.

506
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:32,590
还没到那个程度
It's not quite there yet.

507
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:48,788
太多狄更斯的了
I mean, enough Dickens.

508
00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:50,785
查尔斯·狄更斯
Charles Dickens.

509
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:52,553
腓力斯人 哥们
Philistines, bro.

510
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,087
蒲鲁斯特

512

吉米 朗斯顿·休斯

514
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,621
他们把他留这了
They left him!

515
00:33:02,821 --> 00:33:04,188
哥们
Bro!

519
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:27,255
醒醒
Wake up.

520
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:34,621
我有个主意
Got a plan.

521
00:33:57,189 --> 00:33:59,152
疯了
It's crazy.

522
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:01,188
我上次来这的时候 这些野草比我还高
Last time I was here, these weeds was taller than me.

523
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:05,453
她高兴见到我们吗?
She's expecting us?

524
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:06,788
是的长官
Yes, sir.

这附近挺和谐的
This is a nice neighborhood.

535
00:34:44,189 --> 00:34:46,387
他最好别把我滑板弄坏了

536
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,685
闭嘴

是他把那滑板拿出来的

有时候单是看着
Sometimes it's just

那么
So,

你还有多少这些旧东西?
how much of this stuff do you still have?

549
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,352
真的假的?
Really?

550
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:27,686
你还有多少这些旧东西?
How much of this stuff do you have?

551

就这么直接?
You just, no segue or nothin'?

552
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:31,519
你就是来这看这些东西的?是吧?
You just came to see the stuff, huh?

563
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,356
不是你爸把你送来的吧
Your daddy didn't send you here, right?

564
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:01,518

我可不希望
'Cause I hope he's done

567
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:09,189
他老是管着你
dragging you into his schemes.

568
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:12,554
姑姑 只有我们
Auntie, this is for us.

569

Hey, you remember that, uh, warehouse we squatted at?

720
00:47:20,955 --> 00:47:22,852
离开埃尔多拉多之后吗?
After we lived in the El Dorado?

721
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:26,019
我们因为没交税被赶出来
We lost that ' cause we didn't pay taxes, right?

722
00:47:26,021 --> 00:47:27,352
嗯 没交
Hell, nah.

我交了我们的那一份
I paid our fair share of tax on that.

724
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,852
但是谁在乎呢 那个舒服的狗窝
But who cares, old drafty-ass roach nest.

725
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:36,785
不是睡在那
Shit, it was that,

726
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,054
就是露宿街头
or sleeping on the street with your little ass.

727

我现在有个地方住了
So, say I'm at a place now

730
00:47:48,654 --> 00:47:49,955
住户离开了
and the owners left it,

731
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,251
我得交税
I'm gonna pay taxes on it...

732
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:55,351
你的电气费都是你的名义吗?
And you put gas and electric in your name?

00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:07,651
没人会去检查吧
And nobody's come to check on it?

737
00:48:07,653 --> 00:48:09,121
没 那里很空荡
Nope. It's empty.

738

好
Good.

739
00:48:12,354 --> 00:48:13,889
你要花点时间了
That buys you time.

Wait, what?

743
00:48:22,587 --> 00:48:24,818

You were workin' on it while they were still in it?

744
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,022
是
Yeah.

Where is this house?

746
00:48:32,854 --> 00:48:34,254
菲尔莫

747
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:45,621
喔
Wow.

748
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:53,055

Our old house.

什么意思 我们的老房子

Then you know that's not your old house

754
00:49:11,154 --> 00:49:13,822

755
00:49:18,254 --> 00:49:20,721
混小子

Everybody's little path.

760
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:40,988

喔
Wow.

784
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,285
我爸以前干活时
A little room I used to come in

785
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:51,188
我经常去的小房间
when my dad was doing his thing.

786
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:54,822
很棒吧
It's cool, right?

787
00:52:56,753 --> 00:52:58,020
是啊
Yeah, man.

788
00:53:00,588 --> 00:53:01,788
你今天见到他了吗？
Did you see him today?

789
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:06,221
怎么样？
How'd it go?

790
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:09,755
他说这主意糟透了
He said this was a bad idea.

791
00:53:13,254 --> 00:53:15,017
你不是说他是个白痴吗
Thought you said he was an idiot.

792
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:17,887
不 他只是因为失去了房子而生气而已
Nah, he's just mad 'cause he lost the house.

793
00:53:20,153 --> 00:53:22,754
但是要是我们不该来这呢？
But what if we shouldn't be here?

794
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:26,087
谁不该来这？
Who should be here more?

795
00:53:27,688 --> 00:53:28,755
嗯？
Hmm?

796
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,722
百万富翁吗？
Some millionaire?

797
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,521
房子看起来很棒他们才想要
They'd want it 'cause it looks nice.

798
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:40,987
但这都是你的努力换来的
You're the reason it looks nice, Jim.

799
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:46,985
我不知道
I don't know.

800
00:53:50,254 --> 00:53:51,821

我邀请了别人
I invited somebody.

802
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,850
你好

你能来太好了
Glad you could make it.

804
00:54:09,253 --> 00:54:10,821
这发生了什么
What's goin' on?

805
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,120
抱歉 稍等
Be back in a sec, pardon me.

806
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:20,887
你们有橙子吗？
Y'all got an organ?

807
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:32,287
柱子和这些东西
Columns and shit.

808
00:54:52,787 --> 00:54:54,884
这里只有你们吗？
It's just y'all here?

809
00:54:54,886 --> 00:54:56,287
对
Yeah.

810
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:00,088
就是房子的问题
It just makes noises.

811
00:55:01,286 --> 00:55:03,817
好吧
Oh, okay.

812
00:55:03,819 --> 00:55:05,117
你做那把椅子太好了
It's nice to see you in that chair,

813
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,318
我没料到你会选那把
I didn't know you'd pick that one.

814
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,319
谢谢
Thanks a lot, bro.

815
00:55:09,321 --> 00:55:11,054
有点尴尬
Kinda awkward,

816
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,187
这地方很棒啊
but this place is cool.

817
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,652
是啊
Yeah.

818
00:55:15,654 --> 00:55:17,719
吉米对这房子做了很多整修工作
Jimmie's been doing a lot to fix it up.

819
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:19,686
你们怎么得到这个房子的
How'd y'all get this?

820

是吉米的
It's Jimmie's.

821
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:23,817
他爷爷盖的
His grandpa built it.

822
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:26,619
他是旧金山的第一个黑人
He was the first black man in San Francisco.

823
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:28,054
他们就是那样叫他的
That's what they call him anyways.

824
00:55:28,852 --> 00:55:30,953
哦

在教养院里的黑人
But you know how niggas be in the group home.

828
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:44,187
人们总是喜欢吹牛
Overexaggerating and shit.

829
00:55:45,886 --> 00:55:47,287
把自己变得厉害之类的
Trying to be all special.

830
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:52,021
但是你没有撒谎 吉米
You weren't lying about this one, though, huh, Jimmie?

831
00:55:52,986 --> 00:55:54,853
你待过教养院?
You were in a group home?

832
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,622
嗯
Yeah.

00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:10,554
你们想去蒸俄罗斯桑拿吗？
You guys wanna go for a schvitz?

836
00:56:16,954 --> 00:56:18,221
什么？
A what?

837
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:28,754
这也是你爷爷做的吗？
Wait, your grandfather made this too?

838
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,621
不是 那是白人做的
Nah. Nah, these white people did.

839
00:56:35,054 --> 00:56:36,154
啊哈
Uh-huh.

840
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,850
不过 你是怎么知道他是第一个黑人
Well, how you know he was the first one, though?

841
00:56:39,852 --> 00:56:41,717
骗人
Nigga be lyin'.

842
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:44,850
他从新奥尔良来

843
00:56:44,852 --> 00:56:47,118
那里全是日本人
There was hella Japanese people, bro.

844
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,352
然后他们就被扔进了集中营
And then they got thrown into little war camps

845
00:56:50,354 --> 00:56:52,717
他从来没有想过要搬进别人的房子
and he wasn't tryin' to move into nobody else's shit,

846
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:54,618
所以他盖了这座房子
so he built this, bro.

847
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,786
太棒了
This is great.

848
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:01,287
你还在玩滑板吧？
You still skate, bro?

849
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:04,951

我不玩了
No, I don't skate no more.

851
00:57:06,886 --> 00:57:09,985
你以前可是个菜鸟
Oh, shit, I mean, you used to be hella raw.

852
00:57:09,987 --> 00:57:11,288

还记得贡纳吗？
Hey, you remember Gunna?

855
00:57:17,153 --> 00:57:19,817
还记得他因为偷糖果女孩的东西被抓吗
Remember when he got caught stealing from the candy lady?

856
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,717
他真是又丑又喜欢大叫
Yeah, he's an ugly-ass crier, really.

857
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,053
天啊

不 有电
No, the power's been on,

903

他在说什么付账单
He's talking about paying some bills.

909
01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:56,184
要是他想给小姑娘多点

910
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:58,121
我也不会拒绝的

他已经付了一半了 爷爷

他在这里待了一段时间了
Well, he's been here for a while, you know?

913
01:01:06,086 --> 01:01:07,920
他也不是我们的家人
And he is not exactly family.

914
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:11,618
他很清楚
I think he knows that.

915
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,017
希望如此
Let's hope so.

916
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:15,617
那么吵是怎么回事

Since when?

我们都还没有谈一下角色
I mean, we haven't even talked about the characters yet.

还没有具体的情节
Don't quite have a plot yet.

924
01:01:35,586 --> 01:01:38,618
我们可以头脑风暴一下
Well, we can brainstorm a little bit.

925
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,985
我觉得我们最擅长
You know, that's where I think we the best at.

926
01:01:40,987 --> 01:01:43,318
头脑风暴了
When we brainstorming.

927
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,284

by myself right now.

929
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:52,620
但是很快我就会和你谈谈的
But I'd love to talk about it soon.

930
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:56,953

01:17:42,253 --> 01:17:44,616
那应该已经在市场上待售了吧
It's on the market, I assume?

1144
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:45,986
他们要多少钱？
How much are they asking?

1145
01:17:46,985 --> 01:17:49,284
至少4百万美金
At least $4 million.

1146
01:17:49,286 --> 01:17:52,819
嗯...你出什么价呢？
Uh... And how much are you willing to put down?

1147
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:55,944
一般该出什么价？
How much is usual?

1148
01:17:55,946 --> 01:17:59,403
一般 安全价大概至少降百分之二十
Well, typically, we'd be looking to secure at least 20%.

1149
01:18:07,502 --> 01:18:09,100
我没有那么多钱
I wouldn't have that.

1150
01:18:12,769 --> 01:18:14,499
可以理解
That's understandable.

1151
01:18:14,501 --> 01:18:16,766
买这块地的话
It's going to be hard to land a place like that.

1152
01:18:16,768 --> 01:18:18,967
如果是我的话...
But suppose I ask instead, uh...

1153
01:18:18,969 --> 01:18:21,535
不 不 听着 
No, no, look.

1154
01:18:22,402 --> 01:18:23,569
我知道的
I get it.

1155
01:18:25,003 --> 01:18:26,466
我太年轻了
I'm young.

1156
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:27,870
我是黑人
Uh, I'm black.

1157
01:18:28,702 --> 01:18:29,837
我不富有
I'm not rich.

1158
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:33,067
我都知道的
I came here knowing all that.

1159
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:35,933
但是让我们都现实点 你也有限额要达成
But let's be real, you also got a quota to meet.

1160
01:18:35,935 --> 01:18:37,034
我也不会说你
Now I'm not calling you

1161
01:18:37,036 --> 01:18:38,600
- 欺负人 - 先生
- a predator... - Sir.

1162
01:18:38,602 --> 01:18:39,800
你也只是在挣钱而已
But you're trying to make your money.

1163
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:41,034
- 就让我帮你吧 - 先生
- So let me help you do that. - Sir.

1164
01:18:41,036 --> 01:18:43,500
这样是行不通的
That's not the way this works.

1165
01:18:43,502 --> 01:18:45,034
你给我什么价我都接受
You can give me whatever deal you gotta give me. I don't care what it is.

1166
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:47,402
因为不像其他人那么随便
'Cause unlike all the other people that default,

1167
01:18:48,569 --> 01:18:51,100
这是我一直想住的房子
this is the only house I'll ever want.

1168
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:54,334
每月的账单我都会付
So I'll never miss a monthly bill, ever.

1169
01:18:54,336 --> 01:18:55,900
你可以给我开最高利息的价 好吗？
You can give me your highest interest rate.

1170
01:18:55,902 --> 01:18:57,634
我理解
I completely understand how you feel, sir.

1171
01:18:57,636 --> 01:18:59,100
你可以给我开最高利息的价 好吗？
You can give me your highest interest rate, okay?

1172
01:18:59,102 --> 01:19:00,566
- 随便搞我 - 不 我完全...
- Fuck... Fuck me. - No, I completely...

1173
01:19:00,568 --> 01:19:01,834
都不用感到内疚
You don't even have to feel bad.

1174
01:19:01,836 --> 01:19:03,003
都不用感到内疚
You don't even have to feel bad.

1175
01:19:04,102 --> 01:19:06,970
好吗？我会毫厘不差的付给你
Okay? I will pay back every single cent.

1176
01:19:09,002 --> 01:19:11,067
抱歉 先生
I'm sorry, sir.

1177
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:13,403
我会毫厘不差的付给你
I will pay back every single cent.

1178
01:19:15,836 --> 01:19:18,466
好的 好的 你赢了
Okay, okay, you win!

1179
01:19:19,668 --> 01:19:21,502
好了 是你的了
Okay, yep, it's yours.

1180
01:19:22,401 --> 01:19:24,599
你个混蛋 说的太有吸引力了
You charming bastard, okay.

1181
01:19:24,601 --> 01:19:26,570
一会儿再跟你聊 再见 
Talk to you soon, buh-bye.

1182
01:19:28,336 --> 01:19:29,933
最近怎么样啊 哥们
How's it going, man?

1183
01:19:29,935 --> 01:19:31,269
还好
Fine, sir.

1184
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:34,870
我看到我们聊过的那座房子正在待售
I noticed the house we discussed is now for sale.

1185
01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:39,034
在你们的相关文献中 有一些警告
There are some alarming elements in your literature

1186
01:19:39,036 --> 01:19:41,333
你应该知道
I thought you would like to know.

1187
01:19:41,335 --> 01:19:43,734
房产局也是
And certainly the Bureau of Real Estate would.

1188
01:19:43,736 --> 01:19:44,803
好的
Uh-huh.

1189
01:19:46,468 --> 01:19:47,933
这里声称
This claims

1190
01:19:47,935 --> 01:19:49,934
那里的产权属于金门景观
the property has a view of the Golden Gate.

1191
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:51,534
而...
Which...

1192
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,434
那是假的
I don't think is true.

1193
01:19:53,436 --> 01:19:54,766
呃
Well,

1194
01:19:54,768 --> 01:19:56,066
不是 不是真的
it isn't. It isn't true.

1195
01:19:56,068 --> 01:19:58,000
还声称原有的
It also claims to have all the original

1196
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,934
"设备 地板 水龙头"
"fixtures, floors, and faucets."

1197
01:19:59,936 --> 01:20:01,433
不对
Isn't true.

1198
01:20:01,435 --> 01:20:02,667
你是想说
And are you planning on disclosing

1199
01:20:02,669 --> 01:20:04,334
没有化粪池吗？
that there's no septic tank?

1200
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:07,466
那意味着 任一天
Which means, any day now,

1201
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:09,502
那个花园都有可能
the garden could be flooded

1202
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:11,536
被屎淹没
with shit.

1203
01:20:13,735 --> 01:20:15,766
发生了什么？
Where's this going, man?

1204
01:20:15,768 --> 01:20:17,867
嗯...
Well...

1205
01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:21,032
你们的售卖似乎都是
All this together seems like false advertisement.

1206
01:20:21,034 --> 01:20:22,834
基于虚假的宣传
Which is grounds for void a sale.

1207
01:20:22,836 --> 01:20:24,867
有可能被吊销执照
Potential revoke of license.

1208
01:20:24,869 --> 01:20:26,837
我就知道是你们
I thought it might've been you guys.

1209
01:20:31,101 --> 01:20:33,269
你出什么价
What's your deal, man?

1210
01:20:34,436 --> 01:20:35,669
没有出价
Don't have a deal.

1211
01:20:37,068 --> 01:20:38,902
嗯...听着
Hmm. Look...

1212
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,499
这层楼的任何一个人
Somebody on this floor

1213
01:20:41,501 --> 01:20:43,002
都有可能去卖那座房子 如果不是我的话
would've gotten that house if it wasn't me.

1214
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:46,502
至少你们认识我 对吗？
At least I'm from here, right?

1215
01:20:48,034 --> 01:20:49,901
我把你们的东西放在街边
I put your stuff on the street

1216
01:20:49,903 --> 01:20:51,633
- 是做了个好事 - 好的
- as a favor. - Okay.

1217
01:20:51,635 --> 01:20:52,801
我本可以直接让卡车拉走
I could've had it trucked away,

1218
01:20:52,803 --> 01:20:53,999
但是我给你们留下来了
but I left it out for you.

1219
01:20:54,001 --> 01:20:56,033
你听着 混蛋
Look, dick wad.

1220
01:20:56,035 --> 01:20:58,067
我没开玩笑 我会去举报你的
I'm not fucking around, I will report you.

1221
01:20:58,069 --> 01:20:59,834
因为什么？
For what?

1222
01:20:59,836 --> 01:21:02,634
桥景的一部分?设备？
Listing a view of the bridge? And fixtures?

1223
01:21:02,636 --> 01:21:03,901
所有人都那样做的
Everybody does that.

1224
01:21:03,903 --> 01:21:06,067
我只是粘贴复制的
I literally copy-pasted that shit.

1225
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:07,936
你们对那房子的历史撒谎了
Well, you're lying about the history of the house.

1226
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:10,500
那我没有撒谎
I'm not lying about that.

1227
01:21:10,502 --> 01:21:12,032
你在撒谎 你说的时间
Yes, you are! You say it was built

1228
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,734
比真正建造的时间早了一百年
one hundred years earlier than it actually was.

1229
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:15,367
比真正建造的时间早了一百年
Look, I'm not making this up.

1230
01:21:15,369 --> 01:21:16,800
你就在撒谎
Yes, you are!

1231
01:21:16,802 --> 01:21:19,466
詹姆斯·菲尔斯在1946年盖的
James Fails built this house in 1946.

1232
01:21:19,468 --> 01:21:20,999
- 詹姆斯? -菲尔斯
- James? - Fails!

1233
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,900
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1234
01:21:22,902 --> 01:21:24,302
听着
Look, man.

1235
01:21:27,436 --> 01:21:29,433
信托契约 1857年
Deed of Trust, 1857.

1236
01:21:29,435 --> 01:21:32,335
建造师吉尔·胡里什么的
Architect Gil-hoo-ley, some shit.

1237
01:21:34,402 --> 01:21:37,399
你说的菲尔斯在90年左右抵押了
Your guy Fails lost it in the '90s.

1238
01:21:37,401 --> 01:21:38,737
看 在这
See, right there.

1239
01:21:40,369 --> 01:21:42,032
听着
Look, man.

1240
01:21:42,034 --> 01:21:44,633
要是你还需要一周时间找找其他地方的话 就拿着
If you need a week to find somewhere else, then take it.

1241
01:21:44,635 --> 01:21:46,599
但是...
But...

1242
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:50,269
别再说我是什么非法占地的了
Don't go pulling some squatters rights shit on me, man.

1243
01:21:52,001 --> 01:21:53,369
我有你的邮件地址
I got your mail.

1244
01:21:55,502 --> 01:21:57,366
我知道你的名字
I know your name.

1245
01:21:57,368 --> 01:21:58,901
我不想叫警察
I don't want to call the cops.

1246
01:22:00,368 --> 01:22:01,802
你去哪了？
I don't want to do that to you.

1247
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:54,902
不重要了
Where'd you go?

1248
01:22:57,401 --> 01:22:58,868
我把东西都搬进去了
Doesn't matter, bro.

1249
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:03,567
只剩下沙发
I got everything inside.

1250
01:23:03,569 --> 01:23:04,969
那玩意儿差点砸到我
Except the couch.

1251
01:23:06,703 --> 01:23:08,369
吉姆...
That shit almost fell on me.

1252
01:23:12,802 --> 01:23:14,269
我
Jim...

1253
01:23:15,901 --> 01:23:17,599
跟房产经纪人谈了谈
I spoke to the realtor.

1254
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:18,968
好吧 去他的
Yeah, fuck that guy.

1255
01:23:24,468 --> 01:23:25,802
他要把我们赶出去
He's gonna throw us out.

1256
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:29,602
还要叫警察
And eventually call the cops.

1257
01:23:32,035 --> 01:23:34,403
我不晓得我们还能这样多久
I don't know how much longer we can keep doing this.

1258
01:23:37,436 --> 01:23:39,003
要是你坚持不下去了我能理解
I understand if you can't.

1259
01:23:39,968 --> 01:23:41,370
确实
I do.

1260
01:23:42,703 --> 01:23:44,036
但是我不会离开
But I'm not leaving.

1261
01:23:49,867 --> 01:23:52,636
- 吉姆 他说你爷... - 我能去哪？
- Jim, he said your grand... - Where am I gonna go?

1262
01:23:54,901 --> 01:23:56,636
我爸在自律组织里
My dad's in the SRO.

1263
01:23:58,602 --> 01:24:00,637
姑姑在那个破地方
My aunt's out in bum fuck.

1264
01:24:02,968 --> 01:24:04,436
我妈...
My mom...

1265
01:24:05,835 --> 01:24:08,869
我甚至都不知道我妈在那
Bro, I don't even know where my mom is.

1266
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:13,002
我不会走的
I'm not leaving, bro.

1267
01:24:16,669 --> 01:24:18,336
我是最后一个了
I'm the last one left.

1268
01:24:24,735 --> 01:24:26,035
我们还有我的房子
We have my house.

1269
01:24:31,069 --> 01:24:32,902
我不能回那里
I can't go back there, bro.

1270
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:39,402
蒙特
Mont,

1271
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:41,637
这座房子...
this house...

1272
01:24:43,635 --> 01:24:46,366
这是我想待的地方
This is what I do.

1273
01:24:46,368 --> 01:24:47,968
这是我们想待的地方 蒙特
Hey, it's what we do, Mont.

1274
01:24:49,468 --> 01:24:50,835
这是我们的
This is our shit.

1275
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:53,303
我们还不能放弃
We can't give up now.

1276
01:24:53,901 --> 01:24:55,403
得继续抗争
We gotta fight.

1277
01:24:56,968 --> 01:24:58,270
对吗？
Right?

1278
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:04,536
对
Yeah.

1279
01:25:08,469 --> 01:25:10,269
我会在你身边的
I'm with you, bro.

1280
01:25:11,468 --> 01:25:12,735
你总是在我身边
You always been with me.

1281
01:25:38,436 --> 01:25:39,936
你在写作吗？
Oh, shit, you're writing?

1282
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:43,466
是

1428
01:35:14,967 --> 01:35:16,802
你将怎么怀念科菲？
How will you remember Kofi?

1429
01:35:20,068 --> 01:35:21,268
嗯...
Um...

1430
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:24,335
嗯...
Um...

1431
01:35:26,368 --> 01:35:29,533
我侄女刚搬到这里的时候
He, you know, he used to come and walk my niece

1432
01:35:29,535 --> 01:35:33,000
他会送她去学校
home from school when she first moved up here.

1433
01:35:33,002 --> 01:35:35,599
他很有礼貌 有点古板
He was a little gentleman, or whatnot,

1434
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:37,869
很贴心 嗯...
you know, sweet, um...

1435
01:35:39,434 --> 01:35:40,836
只是伤心
It's just sad.

1436
01:35:41,702 --> 01:35:43,498
嗯
Mmm.

1437
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:47,098
- 在华纳青年联盟的时候我教过科菲 - 好的
- I coached Kofi in Pop Warner. - Mmm-hmm.

1438
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,601
他在后台帮我整理东西器具
He stayed behind and helped me pack up.

1439
01:35:50,368 --> 01:35:51,736
天天如此
Every day.

1440
01:35:52,768 --> 01:35:53,936
好的
Yeah.

1441
01:35:56,367 --> 01:35:57,869
你呢?年轻人
And how 'bout you, young man?

1442
01:36:03,702 --> 01:36:04,902
该死的
Shit, man.

1443
01:36:06,634 --> 01:36:07,935
我不知道
I don't know.

1444
01:36:10,035 --> 01:36:11,669
我是不是逼他太紧了？
Did I push him too hard?

1445
01:36:13,734 --> 01:36:15,401
科菲是我兄弟
Kofi was my nigga, man.

1446
01:36:19,434 --> 01:36:20,869
我是不是逼他太紧了？
Did I push him too hard?

1447
01:36:29,668 --> 01:36:31,502
好的 你呢？
Mmm. How 'bout you?

1448
01:36:38,567 --> 01:36:39,935
嗯...
Well...

1449
01:36:42,001 --> 01:36:43,735
我对科菲最后的记忆是
My last memory of Kofi

1450
01:36:45,001 --> 01:36:46,668
他在对我说脏话
was him talking shit to me.

1451
01:36:49,367 --> 01:36:51,533
他说了一些最糟糕的混蛋
He said some of the most fucked-up shit

1452
01:36:51,535 --> 01:36:53,302
都不会对我说的话
anybody's ever said to me.

1453
01:36:57,068 --> 01:36:59,032
但是在教养院的时候
But Kofi also got jumped

1454
01:36:59,034 --> 01:37:00,632
他也会为我
for defending me against the older kids

1455
01:37:00,634 --> 01:37:01,935
去对抗那些年长的孩子
in the group home.

1456
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,701
他不喜欢打架
He didn't like to fight,

1457
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:07,636
但是那个时候他却为我挺身而出
but he fought for me then.

1458
01:37:11,001 --> 01:37:12,636
不能片面的判断一个人
People aren't one thing.

1459
01:37:22,401 --> 01:37:23,602
那个
That.

1460
01:37:27,435 --> 01:37:28,735所有...
All...

1461
01:37:29,568 --> 01:37:30,869所有的
All of it.

1462
01:37:33,966 --> 01:37:35,669如果科菲能
What would have happened

1463
01:37:36,567 --> 01:37:38,469来这的话
if Kofi could've

1464
01:37:39,567 --> 01:37:40,901会发生什么？
showed himself?

1465
01:37:42,068 --> 01:37:44,434这个世界
All forms of himself.

1466
01:37:47,734 --> 01:37:49,302对他如此苛刻
The world

1467
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:52,701他却从来
put him in a box!

1468
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,700没有反抗
And he never

1469
01:37:56,702 --> 01:37:57,902没有反抗
pushed beyond it.

1470
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,702让我们
Let us.

1471
01:38:04,768 --> 01:38:06,902让我们代替他来看看
Let us break the boxes!

1472
01:38:08,334 --> 01:38:10,865我们互相搀扶
Let us give each other the courage!

1473
01:38:10,867 --> 01:38:11,901来看
To... To see!

1474
01:38:12,901 --> 01:38:15,802故事不止于此
Beyond the stories we are born into!

1475
01:38:17,568 --> 01:38:18,702让我们
Let us all

1476
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:21,369看看
really look

1477
01:38:21,966 --> 01:38:24,434真正的吉米·菲尔斯四世
at Jimmie Fails IV.

1478
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,967自学成才的历史学家
Self-taught historian.

1479
01:38:36,434 --> 01:38:37,735木匠
Carpenter.

1480
01:38:38,767 --> 01:38:40,899文雅 有爱心的人
Gentle, loving man.

1481
01:38:40,901 --> 01:38:43,465一位真正的幸存者 吉米
A true survivor. Jimmie!

1482
01:38:43,467 --> 01:38:45,432你住过多少地方？
How many places have you lived?

1483
01:38:45,434 --> 01:38:47,433如果明天他们把你赶出去
And if they kicked you out tomorrow,

1484
01:38:47,435 --> 01:38:50,333你还会流连于此
you would still be all those things!

1485
01:38:50,335 --> 01:38:52,366你不仅存在于
You exist beyond the...

1486
01:38:52,368 --> 01:38:55,565那些高墙 你还延续了
These walls, you extend beyond your...

1487
01:38:55,567 --> 01:38:57,532你先人的精神
Your... Your forefathers!

1488
01:38:57,534 --> 01:38:59,565你的存在不止这座房子
You are more than this house!

1489
01:38:59,567 --> 01:39:01,800吉米 你不是为了这些墙而存在
Jimmie, you are not these... These walls!

1490
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:03,533这地板 这天花板
You're not these floors, you're not this ceiling!

1491
01:39:03,535 --> 01:39:05,599- 是时候醒悟了 - 你在干什么呢？
- It's time you know! - Bro, what are you doing?

1492
01:39:05,601 --> 01:39:07,031- 你在干什么呢? - 是时候了
- What are you doing? - It is time!

1493
01:39:07,033 --> 01:39:08,865- 是时候醒悟了 - 我不需要醒悟
- It is time you know! - I don't need to know,

1494
01:39:08,867 --> 01:39:11,635我不需要醒悟 别这样了 停
I don't need to know. Let's stop. Let's stop.

1495
01:39:14,735 --> 01:39:16,700- 吉米...你不需要 - 够了 停
- Jimmie... You don't! - Enough, stop!

1496
01:39:16,702 --> 01:39:18,498- 快停吧 蒙特 - 吉米
- Please, stop. Mont! - Jimmie!

1497
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,700你爷爷没有该这座房子
Your grandpa didn't build this house!

1498
01:39:19,702 --> 01:39:20,735够了
Enough!

1499
01:39:25,367 --> 01:39:26,768他没有盖 吉米
He didn't build it, Jimmie!

1500
01:39:37,001 --> 01:39:38,402
他盖了
Yes, he did.

1501
01:39:40,601 --> 01:39:43,365
- 他盖的这座房子 - 他没有 我看见了
- He built this house! - He didn't, I saw it, man,

1502
01:39:43,367 --> 01:39:44,568
我看见了契据
I saw the deed.

1503
01:39:46,702 --> 01:39:48,702
我看到了
I saw it.

1504
01:40:22,467 --> 01:40:24,736
不晓得那是什么鬼
I don't know what the hell that thing was.

1505
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,732
然后他来了个左勾拳
Then he shoots a left. Psh!

1506
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:42,668
哈
Ha!

1507
01:40:43,401 --> 01:40:44,964
让他们走吧
Man, let 'em leave.

1508
01:40:44,966 --> 01:40:46,967
反正他们没有资格在这
They don't deserve to be in here anyway.

1509
01:40:52,634 --> 01:40:54,335
我们也是
Neither do we.

1510
01:40:58,368 --> 01:40:59,765
你真的要让其他人
You gonna really listen to what

1511
01:40:59,767 --> 01:41:01,636
告诉你什么是真的吗？
another-ass nigga tell you what's true?

1512
01:41:03,901 --> 01:41:06,733
好了 吉宝 振作起来 
Come on, Jayboe, get your spine up, son.

1513
01:41:06,735 --> 01:41:08,968
- 骄傲起来 - 我正在这样做
- Have some pride, man. - I've been doin'.

1514
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:18,967
但是你说
But you say it.

1515
01:41:20,867 --> 01:41:22,335
说什么？
Say what?

1516
01:41:24,635 --> 01:41:25,768
真相
The truth.

1517
01:41:26,701 --> 01:41:29,366
什么？
What?

1518
01:41:29,368 --> 01:41:31,302
爷爷没有盖那座房子
That grandpa didn't build this house.

1519
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:35,031
那都是放屁
Tsk. Man, get outta here with that bullshit.

1520
01:41:35,033 --> 01:41:36,635
振作起来 吉宝
Come on, Jayboe.

1521
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,434
说吧
Just say it.

1522
01:41:58,668 --> 01:41:59,967
我不能说
Can't tell you shit.

1523
01:42:03,334 --> 01:42:05,532
我出去了
I'm outta here, man.

1524
01:42:05,534 --> 01:42:07,434
你继续坐在那吧
You sit in that bullshit if you want.

1525
01:43:38,101 --> 01:43:39,601
吉宝
Jayboe.

1526
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:49,867
一直以来我都在跟别人说他盖的
I been telling people he built it for so long.

1527
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,434
都快忘记那不是真的了
Almost forgot it wasn't true.

1528
01:44:02,634 --> 01:44:04,835
这里是我们的
This was ours.

1529
01:44:05,867 --> 01:44:07,269
不在是了
And then it wasn't.

1530
01:44:09,068 --> 01:44:11,632
你要是还觉得这是我们的
So you just tell yourself what you need

1531
01:44:11,634 --> 01:44:13,635
就继续自己骗自己吧
to make you feel like it still is.

1532
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,502
该死
Shit.

1533
01:44:19,501 --> 01:44:20,668
我也这样做了
I did it, too.

1534
01:44:26,034 --> 01:44:27,568
让你感觉
It makes you feel

1535
01:44:29,367 --> 01:44:30,700
与众不同
special.

1536
01:44:33,666 --> 01:44:35,631
但是现在
But you got a chance to get out

1537
01:44:35,633 --> 01:44:37,501
你有机会摆脱这些了
from underneath all of that now.

1538
01:44:39,801 --> 01:44:41,334
我不想
I don't want to.

1539
01:44:43,534 --> 01:44:44,868
我只是想要它
I just want it.

1540
01:44:48,933 --> 01:44:50,435
这真的就是你想要的吗？
Is that what you really want?

1541
01:44:53,766 --> 01:44:56,934
花费你后半生的时间为此工作
To spend the rest of your life working for this?

1542
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,035
抗争？
Fighting for this?

1543
01:45:04,335 --> 01:45:06,432
我相信
I believe that

1544
01:45:06,434 --> 01:45:07,898
你能把这里变成你的
you could make this place yours.

1545
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:09,402
真的
I really do.

1546
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:18,335
但是你放下的话
But if you leave

1547
01:45:22,701 --> 01:45:24,469
也没有损失什么
it's not your loss.

1548
01:45:26,435 --> 01:45:28,035
这是旧金山的
It's San Francisco's.

1549
01:45:34,867 --> 01:45:36,768
去他的旧金山
Fuck San Francisco.

1550
01:46:19,001 --> 01:46:20,998
- 这城市完了 - 彻底的
- This city blows. - Big time.

1551
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,831
我的意思是我不会
I mean, whatever, I'm not above

1552
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:25,597
住在以前是个破破烂烂的房子里的
living in a former crack house, you know?

1553
01:46:25,599 --> 01:46:28,031
我来这是为了贾妮斯和在飞机上工作
But, I came here for Janis and the Airplane,

1554
01:46:28,033 --> 01:46:30,497
不是为了该死的首付
not to work at a fucking startup.

1555
01:46:30,499 --> 01:46:32,366
兄弟 我都说了几个月了
Dude, I've been saying for months,

1556
01:46:32,368 --> 01:46:33,999
我们搬到洛杉矶东部吧
let's just move to East LA.

1557
01:46:34,001 --> 01:46:35,434
这座城完蛋了
This city's dead.

1558
01:46:35,967 --> 01:46:37,432
不
Nah.

1559
01:46:37,434 --> 01:46:38,835
真的 这座该死的城市
Seriously, fuck this city.

1560
01:46:40,967 --> 01:46:42,335
真的吗？
'Scuse me?

1561
01:46:45,334 --> 01:46:46,967
你没必要仇恨旧金山啊
You don't get to hate San Francisco.

1562
01:46:50,867 --> 01:46:52,269
抱歉 什么？
I'm sorry, what?

1563
01:46:53,034 --> 01:46:54,665
好了 哥们 我是说...
Yeah, dude, I mean...

1564
01:46:54,667 --> 01:46:56,534
抱歉 我想恨什么就恨什么
Sorry, but I'll hate what I want.

1565
01:46:59,101 --> 01:47:00,534
你热爱这座城吗？
Do you love it?

1566
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,800
这个...我住在这里
It's... I mean yeah, I'm here.

1567
01:47:05,767 --> 01:47:07,369
但是我热爱这里吗？
But do I have to love it?

1568
01:47:08,833 --> 01:47:10,800
你不会讨厌它 除非你喜欢它
You don't get to hate it unless you love it.

1569
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,767
典型的公交车无聊废话
Classic Muni shit.

1570
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,398
该谁付钱了 快点 哥们
Who call the money man, come on now, hurry up.

1571
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,434
集中精神
Pay attention!

1572
01:47:32,001 --> 01:47:33,998
伟人亚历山大是个黑人
Alexander the Great was a black man.

1573
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,567
该死的学校不会教你这些
They don't teach you that in the devil school system.

1574
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:41,268
我再也受不了这玩意儿了
I can't take another day of this bullshit.

1575
01:48:49,101 --> 01:48:50,767
吉姆
Oh, Jim.

1576
01:48:56,767 --> 01:48:58,334
抱歉我之前那样
I'm sorry I did that.

1577
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:02,601
那就是个傻逼戏
It was a stupid play.

1578
01:49:05,866 --> 01:49:07,500
不
Nah.

1579
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:10,601
抱歉我没跟你说实话
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

1580

我也想那是真的
I just wanted it to be true.

1581

感觉很好 不是吗？
It felt so good, you know?

1582

还好
It's okay.

1583
01:49:47,101 --> 01:49:48,799
嘿 吉米
Hey, Jimmie.

1584
01:49:48,801 --> 01:49:50,002
你饿了吗？
Are you hungry?

1585
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:52,301
饿死了
Fucking starving.

1586
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:59,931
他在放弃
He's giving up.

1587
01:49:59,933 --> 01:50:01,999
我再也受不了了
I can't take no more.

1588
01:50:03,466 --> 01:50:04,564
他在崩溃
He's breaking down.

1589
01:50:04,566 --> 01:50:06,397
哦 哇
Oh, wow.

1590
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:07,632
他真的在拆公寓
He's really tearing this apartment apart.

1591
01:50:08,933 --> 01:50:11,732
看起来挺刺激的
This looks exciting though, you know?

1592
01:50:11,734 --> 01:50:14,331
- 是 是 - 是吗?真的吗?
- Yeah. Yeah, it is. - Yeah? Oh, yeah?

1593
01:50:16,466 --> 01:50:18,965
- 我感觉到了 - 哦
- Oh! I got it now. - Oh!

1594
01:50:18,967 --> 01:50:20,731
他看起来像是欲火焚身了
He seems like he's horny or something.

1595
01:50:26,967 --> 01:50:28,635
他又在撞门
He's banging on the door again.

1596
01:51:03,833 --> 01:51:05,597
我会的
I will.

1597
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:06,998
我今天就离开旧金山
I'm leaving San Francisco today,

1598

1599
01:51:08,633 --> 01:51:09,699
我会替你照顾好的
I'll take care of it for you then.

1600
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:12,732
我见过他更糟的时候
Well, I've seen him worse.

1601
01:51:12,734 --> 01:51:14,432
祝你玩的开心 伯特
Well have a nice time, Bert.

1602
01:51:14,434 --> 01:51:15,066
- 好的 谢谢 - 不如你...
