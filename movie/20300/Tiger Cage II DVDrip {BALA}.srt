Waise, what do you think?

14
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,776
I appreciate Philip's talent,

15
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,694
but it'll be boring
for couples working together

16
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,100
I'd never be bored!

17
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,370
Don't you regret?

18
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,895
Never!

19
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,134

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,814
Then, do her laundry

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,895
And then...

23
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,740
Petty,

24
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,898

25
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,699
What're you saying?

26
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,339
Poor me...

27
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,179
Right? What's the good of marriage?

28
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,419
You mean it or not?

29
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,893
Sorry, I've to finish my work

30
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,889

34
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,615

the bad habits of Mandy

39
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,812
Don't be so serious!
You understand me, right?

40
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,498

I'd like to deposit the money

51
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,817
So I can get back to US to report duty

52
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,811
No problem! How is Uncle Chiu?

53

56
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,017
Need my help?

57
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,370
No, Waise

58
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,252

give them a good lesson

59
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,968

I...

97
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,898
Where is the money, where is it?

98
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,329
Hurry up!

99
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,338
Tak!

100
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,217
Hi! Dragon!

101
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,850
I've just left the Law office

102
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,891
Are you OK?

103
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,933
It peanut for me,
but there's hell of a mess

104
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,700
Kent...

105
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,812
Kent...

106
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,173
Sir, be calm, don't touch the injured

107
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,136
Come on over!

108
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,939
Be careful Miss, it'll be ok!

109
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,971
Hurry up!

110
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,849
Hello boss,
after Kent'd got on Mandy Chang's Car

111
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,851
The money was gone

112
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,089
Maybe that bitch took away our money

113
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,216
Well,

114
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,769
don't let her tell anyone
about this case

115
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,290
No matter how,
I've to talk to her first

116
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,216
Miss Chang,
can you recall the situation?

117
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,896
It's a mess! That thief...

118
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,137
He... He was running with the robbers

119
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,012
Mind what you're saying!

120
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,494
Are you very sure?

121
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,054
He'd just visited my office, I'm sure!

122
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,489
Don't frame me!

123
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,577
Be calm!

124
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,895
She is framing me!

125
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,328
He's nuts! Don't let him come near me!

126
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,288
You bitch!
Don't you want me to beat you?

127
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,895
Let me go...

128
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,936
I don't want to see him!
Don't let me see his face

129
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,975
He is out of your sight!

130
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,574
Be careful! Slowly...

131
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,055
This way

132
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,337
Thanks

133
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,176
Hurry up!

134
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,888
We've got the wrong guy!

135
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,889
You idiot! Throw him out of the car!

136
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,537
Stop any bull shit!

137
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,292
We've been buddies for so many years,

138
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,171
why don't you trust me?

139
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,336
I do trust you!

140
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,895
But the money is robbed

141
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,009
There must be a betrayer!

142
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,490
Are you tailed all the way to HK?

143
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,656
If so,
I'd have been robbed in C. America!

144
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,973
There must be a betrayer here!

145
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,217
Who are you suspecting?

146
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,609
How much does your girlfriend know?

147
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,298
Nonsense! She won't!
I'm just playing her

148
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,893
I won't let her know such things

149
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,017
How about Mandy Chang?

150
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,971
She won't!

151
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,136
Maybe, she's hiding our money

152
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,971
She wants to take it as her own!

153
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,891
Impossible!

154
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,016
Waise Chow, we've the responsibility to
get the money back

155
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,370
I'll inform Uncle Chiu,
you'd better figure our an explanation

156
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,737
You've heard what we said?

157
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,730
Yes,

158
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,654
the triad members of US export

159
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,898
the dirty money secretly to HK

160
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,579
Cause HK is a free port

161
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,654
They'll white wash the money here
and remit it to US lawfully!

162
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,895
Thus, the govt. can't check it our

163
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,977
You're quite correct

164
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,378
You're the one

165
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,411
who launders the money for them

166
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,611
I've not committed any crime in HK

167
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,537
But to me,

168
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,890
you're no different from
the triad criminals

169
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,334
I do it for our future

170
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,335
You still love me, right?

171
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,458
Are we friends from now on? I doubt it

172
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,331
I wonder if the robbery case

173
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,450
was masterminded by you!

174
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,131
Thanks

175
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,737
Waise, we'd keep the righteousness

176
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,739
for we're the lawyers

177
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,775
But anyway,

178
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,415
we cannot commit crimes!

179
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,451
I always trust you,
but why you cheat me?

180
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,091
I can't forgive you, anyway!

181
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,099
So, sorry...

182
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,530
No! You're the one who'd apology

183
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,210
You'd better think over
how to defend yourself

184
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,248
Inspector Yeung

185
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,330
Speaking!

186
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,570
Hello, I'm Petty Lee

187
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,813
I'm at home, I want to talk to you

188
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,489
Can you come here immediately?

189
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,337
Sure

190
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,251
OK!

191
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,531
May I accompany you home?

192
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,691
No! I'm tired. I want to rest early

193
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,971
Be careful

194
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,610
Sure! Goodbye

195
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,818
You bitch! You frame me again and again!

196
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,656
Do you want me to
teach you a good lesson?

197
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,493
What're you doing? Don't come to me

198
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,058
You've taken half of my property
and you framed me too?

199
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,171
I'm telling the truth!
I'll call the police

200
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,217
I don't give a damn!

201
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,336
I'll beat you to death!

202
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,816
Don't come

203
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,500
Petty!

204
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,658
Blood...

205
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,215
Police! Don't move!

206
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,608
Police! Don't move!

207
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,493
Freeze!

208
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,053
Freeze!

209
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,252
Call the ambulance

210
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,250
Yes Madam

211
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,730
Search!

212
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,531
Yes Madam

213
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,292
PC 26891 calling centre,

214
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,212
please send an ambulance

215
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,455
Petty!

216
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,895
Petty!

217
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,894
Get up!

218
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,529
You're suspected of murder,

219
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,133
go to police station with me

220
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,691
I didn't kill nobody! I didn't

221
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,331
You won't believe me

222
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,615
except I admit murder

223
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,259
Come on, shut up! Go!

224
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,133
Don't touch my head

225
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,897
Go!

226
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,651
Jump!

227
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,770
It's so high! I can't jump!

228
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,770
Jump!

229
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,168
It hurts, leave me alone!

230
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,410
But you'd run for your life!

231
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,570
Hurry up!

232
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,655
Don't shoot!

233
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,218
No... Don't shoot! Don't ...

234
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,411
I'm not going!

235
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,891
Move!

236
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,496
Why you take me here?
I want to see Petty

237
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,655
Bull shit!

238
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,652
Bullets were flying up there!
I don't want to be killed!

239
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,940
I'll be a suspect of homicide
if I run away

240
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,975
You don't? I'll help you!

241
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,891
Put me down!

242
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,732
What're you doing? Damn!

243
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,538
Stop pulling me!

244
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,376
I'm scared

245
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,695
Don't hold me!

246
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,892
Hands off!

247
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,577
Don't pull me!

248
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,850
Why did you beat me?

249
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,578
Are you ok? Get up at once!

250
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,294
Help him! He is falling down

251
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:32,892
Mind yourself!

252
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,974
Why don't you save him? He is falling!

253
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,892
My feet are killing me! I can't walk!

254
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,377
Let me go! Where do you take me to?

255
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,894
Let me down! Damn you!

256
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,012
Are you crazy!

257
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,449
Are you happy?

258
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,334
Let me down!

259
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,492
Don't pull my hair!

260
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,856
I'll make you blind!

261
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,419
I can't see! You'll be easily hurt!

262
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,537
You wanna get killed?
I almost run you over!

263
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,009
Bastard, go to hell!

264
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,097
Don't play on the road

265
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,969
Don't block my way...

266
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,690
I am sorry!

267
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,413
My foot! It's painful!

268
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,929
Don't move, cops

269
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,132
He kidnaps me!

270
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:39,898
I didn't

271
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,969
Arrest him...

272
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,134
You've assaulted a police officer!

273
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,899
Help! He kidnaps me!

274
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,448
Don't shout...

275
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,498
Are you ok?

276
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,932
Breathe deeply

277
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,889
Don't die,

278
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,894
I don't want to
be charged of another homicide

279
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,975
Are you ok?

280
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,134
Let's go!

281
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,890
Where is it?

282
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,530
This is my home

283
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:14,973
Where are you going?

284
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,215
Hurry up!

285
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,929
What do you want?

286
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,129
Pissing!

287
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,016
I won't go in there!

288
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,898
I won't let you in too!

289
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,291
Don't pull!

290
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,616
It's painful!

291
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,968
Stop!

292
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,011
What're you doing!

293
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,735
Let me down!

294
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,656
Get up!

295
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,931
Don't come over! Don't!

296
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,256
You think I want you to stick around?

297
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,133
If not the cuff, who'll care about you?

298
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:34,977
Who do you think you are?

299
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,096
Why did you follow me home?

300
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,935
You've framed me of robbery

301
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,970
So I came for you

302
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,780
I did see you rushing out
together with the robbers

303
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,737
If I were a thief, you'd have been killed

304
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,137
After raped! Don't cry!

305
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,339
Was the dead

306
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,331
your friend?

307
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,889
Don't move!

308
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,896
You're smart in the solicitor's office

309
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,251
But now, you look shit!

310
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,979
We can no longer stay here

311
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,373
The police will find us here

312
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,890
There was a murdering case
in Happy Valley last night

313
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,772
An experienced lawyer Petty lee

314
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,408
was killed in her apartment

315
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,896
Shoot outs occur between

316
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,177
the police and the suspects

317
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,973
2 police officers were seriously injured

318
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,131
3 suspects are wanted now

319
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,012
They are: Dragon Yau,
nick named Mad Dragon

320
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,051
Around 30 years old,
is a retired police officer

321
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,057
Mandy Chang, lawyer

322
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,097
And a suspect
who dressed in motor cyclist suits

323
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,939
Any body finds them, please...

324
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,534
See, we're being wanted!

325
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,772
What's your idea? Solicitor Chang!

326
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,175
What happened? Petty was killed,
I become a murdered!

327
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,571
Hey!

328
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,580
Let's eat first, come on

329
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,259
Your noodle will get cold!

330
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,012
You don't like me, anyway

331
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,293
Change my ex-wife's clothes after eating

332
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,934
Then, do what you like

333
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,058
After the death of Petty,

334
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,898
David following us

335
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,013
I think, he must know the secret

336
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,375
Let's go for him, ok?

337
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,530
Are you begging me?

338
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,574
Let's eat first

339
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,329
It's hot!

340
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,893
Sorry, I didn't intend to!

341
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,328
Did the cops treat you badly?

342
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,059
No, I've informed Uncle Chiu,

343
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,295
he'll in charge of the case

344
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,497
I'm leaving

345
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,259
Follow him, see what's he doing!

346
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,216
Yes!

347
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,217
I'm looking for you

348
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,290
Me too

349
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,291
Hit him!

350
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,898
What's the use of at stick?

351
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,890
Find a big one!

352
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,055
I've never hit any body!

353
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,369
Get bigger one!

354
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,778
Left side... left side!

355
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,615
Don't scare me!

356
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,971
Wake up please! I don't intend to...

357
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,455
Wake up!

358
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,416
Mandy Chang!

359
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,577
It's Mandy!

360
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,249
Dragon, try your best to stop the car!

361
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,893
Dragon, they're after me,
come up and help me!

362
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,055
You'd better come down!

363
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,858
It's high! How can I?

364
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,298
There are stairs! Idiot!

365
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,490
Go!

366
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:50,858
Where?

367
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,690
Over there!

368
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,570
I can't walk...

369
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,457
Run!

370
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,340
They're close! You trouble maker!

371
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
Did you kill Petty?

372
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,293
Why you killed her?

373
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,171
I didn't

374
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,530
Give the money back to me

375
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,896
If the money is taken by me,
why should I stay here?

376
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:27,851
Why should I come to you?

377
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,339
What sort of money is it?

378
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,213
Speak up! Or I'll lose my temper?

379
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,656
Chase them!

380
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,336
Release me!

381
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,852
How are you? Are you ok?

382
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,496
Stop!

383
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,656
Give me back the money,
it is important to me!

384
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,895
Is it dirty money?

385
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,775
It's not your concern,
you can't take it!

386
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,690
Give it back to me

387
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,016
I don't want to tell, how's it?

388
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,455
In my home

389
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,570
He means his home!

390
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,688
We don't know!

391
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,537
Sorry!

392
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,055
If I killed Petty,

393
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,371
I could have killed you too

394
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,974
Who are they?

395
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,379
I do want to know.

396
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,532
I suspect that
there is a betrayer in your office

397
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,055
This is my phone no.
Call me if you're in need

398
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,453
I'll call you

399
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,655
I'm back to investigate

400
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,892
Who's the guts to steal from Uncle Chiu

401
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,054
Kent was dead on the car of Mandy Chang

402
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,893
I've asked my boys to catch them back

403
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,697
But I don't know why David let them go!

404
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,892
Is it true?

405
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,857
If it's true,

406
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,817
I won't ask you here
to be in charge of this case

407
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,013
I'll find the money back and find out

408
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,097
who's the head of this case

409
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,575
This is my territory,

410
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,895
may I send someone to help you?

411
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,017
No!

412
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,899
The one who killed Kent would pay for it

413
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,897
Hello, I'm Mandy, may I speak to Philip?

414
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,889
Philip is busy,
he told you not to call him again

415
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,452
A table for...

416
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:56,978
Two

417
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,896
That way please

418
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,776
Please sit

419
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,016
Let's eat!

420
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,850
The beer's come

421
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,535
Alcohol makes me happy

422
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,893
See! You're stupid, your clothes' wet!

423
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,896
Thank!

424
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,010
Thank!

425
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:44,897
Let's eat

426
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,890
OK!

427
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,895
You're rude!

428
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,976
Let's try!

429
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,135
It's hot

430
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,896
In the past,
I think you're a rude person,

431
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,858
but you're not

432
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,658
Why do you make yourself disgusting?

433
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,249
When I was a cop, if you are not fierce

434
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,132
The rascals won't to scared

435
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,932
"Hey bastard who you are?"

436
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,889
You'd ask like this!

437
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,216
Why did your wife leave you?

438
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,730
If you were her, would you leave me?

439
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,897
I don't know, cause I'm not your wife

440
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,096
I help her cause she is my client!

441
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,614
I'll help you

442
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,817
when you divorce again, ok?

443
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,134
Next?

444
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,137
If I were Philip, I'd have helped you

445
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,850
Don't talk about that bastard

446
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,660
Ok... Sorry

447
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,213
The bill please

448
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,609
Coming!

449
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,259
$180

450
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,891
$180, what'll we do?

451
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,014
Sorry, we do want some more dish

452
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,929
I think you've

453
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,732
never committed any crime

454
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,770
What?

455
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,850
I don't have enough cash with me

456
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,899
You bastard, get lost at once

457
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,732
Your girl stays with me tonight

458
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,417
What's the matter?

459
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,492
Sorry!

460
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,895
What's that on? Crazy!

461
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,897
Help!

462
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,459
Shut up! Knee down!

463
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,897
Open the door!

464
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,930
That way!

465
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,210
Go!

466
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,895
Hurry up!

467
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,495
Dragon!

468
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,455
Don't! Stop!

469
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,175
Stop!

470
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,299
If you want to leave safely

471
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,899
Give back the money

472
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,899
I won't mistreat you two!

473
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,215
I treat you as my role model,

474
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,893
I can't imagine
you're doing this dirty job!

475
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,899
I don't need
your comment of my personality

476
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,896
But I need to know where's the money

477
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,139
I know it!

478
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,055
The US dollars put

479
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,611
in a black brief-case, right?

480
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,608
You can't take away the money,
give it back to me

481
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,495
I'll make you a share!

482
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,616
Ok, why don't you let us go,
then I'll give you half of it

483
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,256
What a proud idiot!

484
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,536
Dragon!

485
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,890
I feel so good! It's like massage!

486
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,890
Faster please!

487
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,611
Boss!

488
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,696
The men from US have come

489
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,735
Watch them carefully

490
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,618
I'll return soon

491
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,129
It's so nice

492
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,928
It's of 1st class

493
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,055
Right!

494
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,536
Good!

495
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,175
But Mr. Luciano

496
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,938
is not satisfied with the deal

497
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,335
Anything makes him dissatisfied?

498
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,776
Even he does,

499
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,857
who do you think you're?

500
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,330
I've agreed with him that

501
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,775
We'll share the business of

502
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,213
Uncle Chiu after Chiu's death

503
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,449
50/50

504
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,418
By Luciano and me, is that clear?

505
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,172
Just wait until we see Chiu's death body

506
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,457
Bull shit, if you can kill Chiu

507
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,615
You won't be in my office,
begging for my help

508
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,012
Sit, sit...

509
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,009
I've got it!

510
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,416
My boss agreed with the terms

511
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,295
We're straight forward people

512
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,576
I'll present the body of Chiu on time

513
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,815
Will your buddy arrest us?

514
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,895
He's loyal to friends,

515
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,329
he's not like Philip

516
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,814
Don't even mention that bastard!

517
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,895
Ok...

518
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,259
Tak!

519
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,848
Tak, I'm Dragon!

520
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,893
I don't see you! You'd better leave

521
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,093
You're invisible to him, let's go

522
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,256
What's that mean?

523
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,695
I'm not your buddy if I arrest you,

524
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,889
I'm not a cop if I don't do my job

525
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,092
I'm innocent! Why you treat me so cool?

526
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,090
Why do you come to me so secretly?

527
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,892
You must be the criminal

528
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,659
I didn't do it,
that's why I come to you

529
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,255
Let it be! He doesn't take
a glance at you, leave now

530
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,893
We're no thieves! Why should we leave?

531
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,528
Ok, I'm now arresting you

532
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,418
We're good buddies,
how come you treat me like that?

533
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,651
Don't stop me,
I'll give him a good lesson

534
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,571
Who do you think you are?

535
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,133
I've to arrest of
you've offended the law

536
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,899
Stop!

537
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:40,891
Get lost, bitch!

538
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,688
Help!

539
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,499
Help! I can't swim...

540
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,850
Hold on, I'll save you!

541
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,296
Go and save her now!

542
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,171
You know I can't swim, go and help!

543
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,498
Hurry up!

544
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,653
You always add me trouble
when I ask for help!

545
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,897
You've always made me down graded!

546
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,778
I'm benefiting you cause we're buddies

547
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,129
If you do this for me,

548
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,529
you'll surely be appreciated

549
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,500
You'll make me in deep shit!

550
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,378
You always bring troubles to me!

551
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,373
You've really a strong fist

552
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:24,938
Thanks!

553
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,893
Welcome, it's nothing

554
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,619
Let me do it

555
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,612
No, I've almost finished

556
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,736
Let me do it

557
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:32,892
Are you ok?

558
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,894
Ok!

559
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,419
Let me use Tse-ku to heal you

560
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,940
You know it?

561
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,295
Sure, but lack of practice

562
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,857
Take your clothes off!

563
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,895
You're great!

564
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,936
Comfortable!

565
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,579
Yes, but a bit painful

566
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,895
I've just called David,

567
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,489
he is on his way to here

568
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,497
What?

569
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,895
He gave me his name card

570
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,254
He asked us to call him for help

571
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,895
Why you trust him?

572
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,291
Tak, come on

573
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:28,972
What's the matter?

574
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,335
Come on!

575
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,690
Can I borrow it?

576
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,816
You're putting me in trouble again?

577
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,896
When did I put you in trouble?

578
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:36,896
Other than those incidents!

579
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,011
Go to buy something to eat, I'm hungry!

580
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,450
I pay for it again?

581
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,009
Sure, cause we're buddy?

582
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:42,852
You...

583
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,895
Are we buddy?

584
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,773
You always make your buddy miserable!

585
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,736
Stop!

586
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,695
Dragon, what are you doing?

587
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,338
What're you doing?

588
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,893
You damn ABC, you play tricks on me?

589
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:06,376
Kill me then!

590
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,770
I don't want to do it!

591
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,529
You'd deserve it

592
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,569
What are you doing

593
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,494
Cruel interrogation

594
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,769
Hold the bowl

595
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,859
Don't

596
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,896
Don't move!

597
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,929
If you want your face ruined, move

598
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,096
What's the relationship
between you and Waise Chow?

599
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,455
Do you want to murder him?

600
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,610
Put it back!

601
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,616
Hands off!

602
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,891
Oh my face hurts!

603
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,894
Damn! Oh! My face...

604
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,055
Help! It's painful...

605
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,373
Will water hurt you face?

606
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,889
It's only water!

607
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,975
Look into the mirror!

608
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,976
I'm scared! You nuts!

609
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,849
You deserve it

610
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,529
You want to know it? Ok!

611
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,612
Those are the dirty money
I brought from US

612
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,771
Waise Chow's responsible to
white wash it

613
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,896
I'm suspecting that
he arranged the robbery & murder!

614
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,577
You idiot! He is on our side!

615
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,410
See, no bullet!

616
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,573
Give me the keys, hurry up!

617
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,895
Be quick!

618
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,896
Thanks!

619
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:43,890
I'm sorry!

620
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,657
I know where Mandy & Dragon are

621
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,572
Really?

622
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,896
Yours dirty money is taken away

623
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,890
by them

624
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,613
I give you the people,
you give me 30% of the money, ok?

625
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,569
What dirty money?

626
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,930
Stop acting,
I can arrest them anything, so that

627
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,533
They'll disclose your crime

628
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:02,972
Sergeant,

629
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,576
I'm a lawyer as well as a merchant

630
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,055
What secret do you mean?
You're black-mailing me

631
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,496
It's a trade only,

632
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,214
deal or no deal, it's up to you

633
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,176
You want to black mail me?
You're not wise enough!

634
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,735
Mr. Chow, what do you want to show me?

635
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,172
Your fellow wants to blackmail me,
he hides the criminals too

636
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,819
You can search him.

637
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,532
He taped the conversation

638
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,575
Search!

639
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,217
Don't drive mad...

640
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,575
Don't push him!

641
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,653
I've a tape too

642
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,898
Sergeant Ho,
if you beg me to defend you

643
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,131
You may be spared

644
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,138
You asshole!

645
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,214
Tak, give a report to me

646
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,214
During the investigation,
you are temporarily suspended

647
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,215
Are you ok?

648
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,297
I'm ok!

649
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,130
You're so careless

650
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,335
Inspector Yeung,
although such thing happened

651
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,299
I'm still willing to co-operate with you

652
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,217
Thanks

653
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,899
Miss Leung, may I come in?

654
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,895
Sure

655
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,408
What can I help you?

656
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,940
I'm suspecting you are linked with
the murder of Petty Lee

657
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,895
You're under arrest!

658
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,412
Don't go, or I'll shoot

659
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,335
It's illegal!

660
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,019
How can we arrest Waise without a car?

661
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,577
You've being suspected of murder,
which is more serious crime than this

662
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,094
Hurry up!

663
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,859
It'll be ok soon!

664
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,459
Get on the car!

665
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,419
Come on!

666
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,334
You're great,
you're faster in stealing car!

667
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,330
It's on hire, idiot!

668
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,575
Why'd we steal? Idiot!

669
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,649
Sit the back seat, I'll drive

670
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,611
Why?

671
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,293
I'm familiar with the traffic of HK

672
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,172
But you're wanted by the police!

673
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,011
Sit at the back

674
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,170
Shut up!

675
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,895
You 2 sit at the back, I'll drive

676
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,378
There is Waise's home,

677
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,611
I'll give you signal

678
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,931
Then you go and stop his car

679
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,611
How about you?

680
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,415
We'll catch a fainted Waise
for questioning

681
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,330
How you drive?

682
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,898
David, what are you doing?

683
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:19,615
He's Uncle Chiu!

684
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,690
What shall we do then?

685
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,490
Boss is being attacked!

686
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:24,890
We'd fight back!

687
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,416
Take the knife!

688
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,175
Watch out!

689
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,529
Go after them!

690
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,296
Don't go!

691
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:43,896
You dare to run?

692
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,454
Mandy

693
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:09,970
Don't go!

694
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,776
Kill him!

695
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:03,617
Where is here?

696
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:04,372
Hotel!

697
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,211
Where are my clothes?

698
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,854
Yours are dirty & worn,
I've got rid of it

699
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,817
Did you... touch me?

700
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,569
Sure

701
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,699
Otherwise, how can I put you in bed

702
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,130
You are over weight!

703
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,773
Any more?

704
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,336
Any?

705
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,175
Good figure

706
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:28,776
You've seen my body?

707
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,852
No! Except the important part!

708
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,091
Those clothes are wet,
it'll make you sick

709
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,650
What else did you do?

710
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,050
I did want to do something,

711
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:40,534
but you awaked early

712
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:41,890
Next time I'll do it

713
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,816
How dare you?

714
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,728
Sorry, I don't intend to!

715
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,331
You've seen me, we break even

716
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,895
I didn't!

717
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,291
Ok, I'll let you see once more!

718
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:04,895
You...

719
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,851
Ok, don't you think I'm scared!

720
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,456
Take if off you've guts,
I'll tease you!

721
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,539
Take if off! Why not?

722
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,779
Don't be serious!

723
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:26,252
I've brought you a suit, try it

724
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:34,089
I think you'll look pretty, try it

725
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:36,895
How is Dragon?

726
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,815
Who's the litter bug?

727
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,453
I'll call the police?

728
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,532
Who did it! Com out! Bastard!

729
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:59,690
What's the matter?

730
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,816
What're you doing here?

731
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,699
Don't go!

732
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,895
Freeze!

733
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:25,898
Go over there!

734
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:26,891
Ok!

735
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,617
No.6767 reply

736
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,776
What? They're in motel now?

737
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,579
Open the door!

738
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,214
Sorry, I'm off!

739
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,496
You're committing an ordinance!
I'll sue you

740
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,775
You're stink

741
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,536
Don't come in!

742
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,212
My friends live here

743
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,336
You're stink, you can't come in

744
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,495
I can't smell it

745
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,616
You're stink!

746
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,810
Where's Mandy?

747
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,530
Bathing

748
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,618
While I was risking my life,

749
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,299
you took her here?

750
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,333
What's that mean?

751
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,577
What did you do to her?

752
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,896
This is my privacy,
none of your business!

753
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,456
You want to court her,
that's my business

754
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,450
Is she your wife?

755
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:02,898
No

756
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,294
Sister?

757
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:04,940
No

758
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:05,577
Your mom?

759
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,530
You crazy!

760
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,453
That mean,
it's none of your business, right?

761
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,293
Damn you!

762
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,893
What are you arguing?

763
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,972
Dragon, why you look like this?

764
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,011
I'm worrying about you

765
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,816
I'm fine

766
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:22,775
Are you staying here for long?

767
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,896
Half the night, I've just waked up

768
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,734
You look pretty

769
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,975
Isn't it? Dragon

770
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:33,497
Yes

771
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,894
He gives it to me

772
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,773
Turn a round

773
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:43,938
What're you doing?

774
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,979
Stomach-ache...

775
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,812
I'm going to get the jacket

776
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:50,972
You won't believe in me,

777
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,091
you'd better ask her

778
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,331
Don't you think I'm scared?

779
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:54,896
What's the matter?

780
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:55,897
He's something to ask you

781
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,378
What? Go ahead

782
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,495
You look ugly for
lacking of enough sleep

783
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,053
You're even worse

784
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,973
What I concern most is
how to find the money back

785
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,814
I won't care anything else

786
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,134
This is your own business

787
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,579
I'll give you bonus
if you get the money back tome

788
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,895
US $300,000

789
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,460
It's such a small amount!
I've seen the case, it's filled with money

790
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,770
You saw the case?

791
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,858
Your partner with
the case has pumped info me

792
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,498
before entering the lift

793
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,413
Hold it, I saw Kent running out

794
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:45,809
without holding anything

795
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,018
I know where the money put

796
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,849
Come down!

797
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,130
Sometimes, violence works

798
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,135
Mandy, lady first

799
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,657
We'd do such dangerous thing

800
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:39,895
You'd better watch out

801
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,655
Get up

802
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,778
Watch out!

803
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,660
Dragon, watch out too!

804
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,135
Ok?

805
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:19,093
Did you sleep with Mandy?

806
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,012
If I say no, you won't believe

807
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,211
If I say yes, you'll totally believe

808
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,415
You'd better ask her

809
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,208
Find it?

810
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,095
What is ti?

811
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,693
We're rich!

812
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,893
Mandy, cheers

813
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,254
You'll deserve it

814
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,418
Another one here,
I've burned a 50 note only

815
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,136
Come on ABC, let's cheers

816
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:34,770
Thanks for your help

817
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,893
I do it for myself only

818
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,413
Who is going to beat Waise Chow for me?

819
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:56,935
I'll do it

820
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,009
What've you planned?

821
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,460
1st, I'll go back to US,

822
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,896
2nd, to find a girl friend here

823
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,091
Girl friend? How's she look?

824
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,134
Have a look of this photo,
you'll know it

825
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,214
Have a look, come on...

826
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:26,893
It's me!

827
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:45,890
I always think of getting rich

828
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,896
But I've never think of
the life after rich

829
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,329
Now, I've got it!

830
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:59,250
I'll go to Caribbean Sea for sun bath

831
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:03,295
I've heard that the girls
there are easily hooked

832
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,899
Do you know where's Caribbean Sea?

833
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:06,890
I don't know

834
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,455
You're jealous only

835
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,897
I'm not qualified to jealous,

836
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,215
but I can drink...

837
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,215
I know who I am!

838
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,932
Best wishes to you two

839
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,090
My regards to you two!

840
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,371
To us? That means we're gays?

841
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,498
I'll take this money
to Uncle Chiu tomorrow

842
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,651
Don't you afraid of Waise Chow?

843
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,940
He can do nothing cause Chiu's here

844
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,009
Give me the bonus

845
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,375
Take it yourself

846
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,896
Dragon, which is more important?
Money or friend?

847
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,379
Both are important to me

848
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:08,888
I'll go with you tomorrow

849
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,330
Thanks, this is my family business

850
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,898
Do you treat us as friends?

851
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,500
Ok, let's go together

852
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:19,890
But now,

853
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,658
let's enjoy ourselves first

854
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,050
Sure!

855
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,289
Let's play the guessing game,
drink a glass of wine if you loss

856
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,889
If I loss, I'll drink double

857
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,295
No. Let's make it equal!

858
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,411
Be fair!

859
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,257
Ready, go!

860
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:37,897
Six, Ten, Eight, Six

861
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,015
You loss!

862
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,611
Why the glass shakes?

863
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,770
Hold it tight for me please

864
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,896
Ok... Come again!

865
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:58,732
Six... Six... Ten

866
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:01,171
You loss again, drink it

867
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,608
Ok, I'll drink it

868
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,609
Again?

869
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,972
Sorry? Buddy, take this first

870
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,454
Later on, I'll pay you the rest

871
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,773
You'd not make him drunk

872
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,299
if you treat us friends

873
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,171
Sorry, I didn't mean it

874
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,299
Can you stop going?

875
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,692
Are we better than yesterday we are?

876
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,250
That's why we'd have a better tomorrow

877
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,328
See you

878
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:02,051
Goodbye

879
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,137
Wake up!

880
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:05,937
Is it snowing?

881
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,130
Wake up! Hey

882
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,499
Uncle Chiu, I've found the money back

883
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,615
I've enough evidence that

884
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:21,889
Waise is the one
who masterminded the case

885
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:27,892
Uncle Chiu,
the money is here please judge it

886
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,812
He said that he'd enough evidence,

887
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,334
then judge it

888
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,214
Oh! He can't talk!

889
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,089
He can't judge it!

890
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,814
See, they're fighting!

891
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,209
Let them be! Let's watch

892
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:12,897
Go to hell!

893
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,893
What're you doing?
You'd sneeze to the wall

894
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,215
Sorry

895
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,576
Hurry up, he is coming

896
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,333
David...

897
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,729
Don't move...

898
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,855
Don't come over, or I'll shoot!

899
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:45,253
I mean it...

900
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,379
Let's go, Mandy

901
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,260
How are you, you should not die

902
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,931
We've agreed to go together,
why you go alone?

903
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:20,897
You deserve it

904
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,568
Shut up!

905
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:26,612
I don't want to put you into trouble

906
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:30,450
You'll be ok, David!

907
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:33,657
You can't die! You'd pay me the bonus

908
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:34,770
You cannot die

909
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,891
We're good friends, let's pay it later, ok?

910
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:40,940
If you don't pay we,

911
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,009
you'd not die!

912
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,654
Mandy

913
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,620
I think we can earn money together!

914
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,738
We will be partners

915
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:00,652
Our business will be so busy.
We'll work happy together

916
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,859
David!

917
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:39,978
The goods will be loaded today

918
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,893
in Kong Tai Godown, Yau Tong

919
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,940
Let's leave HK together
with the money ok?

920
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:13,738
No, we've not committed any crime

921
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,896
If we leave now,
we'll be wanted criminals forever

922
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,977
We can't let Waise Chow go!

923
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:21,500
Are you crazy? He is powerful here

924
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,289
The police are wanting us,
we can't do anything!

925
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:26,129
You can leave alone

926
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,133
I want to be proved innocent
even if I'm killed!

927
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:30,976
You'll deserve it!

928
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,170
Don't block my way,

929
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,168
I'm not like you!

930
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,011
You've money in mind only!

931
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,290
I don't want to be a chicken!

932
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:38,849
It's none of your business

933
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:39,929
Stay where you are!

934
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:46,892
What is this?

935
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,131
If I were a money lover, I'd have left

936
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,096
who will help you?

937
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,335
If I am a chicken,

938
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:54,135
who's staying here safely? Lawyer Chang!

939
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:55,733
Hands off me!

940
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,853
Boss...

941
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,369
Tak!

942
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,252
Don't hide up! Get out now!

943
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:49,736
Or, I'll shoot him! Come out!

944
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,012
Ok, I'll shoot!

945
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:55,891
Leave me alone!

946
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,058
If I die, kill him for me!

947
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:03,813
Come out, or I'll shoot more!

948
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,249
You bastard!

949
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,889
I'm here! Come on... Shoot!
