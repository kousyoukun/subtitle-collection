1
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,930
Good evening, child.

2
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,490
Evening, Mama.

3
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,530
Home already? I'm so happy.

4
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,330
Not so fast.

5
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,450
Please. Leave me be.
I'm tired.

6
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,330
I can quite believe it.

7
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,930
Your last pupil left 3 hours ago.

8
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,810
Might I know
where you've been all this time?

9
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,530
Please.

10
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,770
No, you don't.
Not until you tell me!

11
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,890
I went for a walk. Do you mind?

12
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,890
I spent 8 hours in my cage.
I was tired and needed some air.

13
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,130
- For three hours?
- Absolutely!

14
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,290
Magnificent.

15
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,090
Just as I thought.

16
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,410
Where's the bankbook?

17
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,570
1 0,000 Schillings!

18
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,530
Tell me, have you lost your mind?

19
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,090
Where's my grey Autumn suit?

20
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,290
No idea.

21
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,410
Give that back.

22
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,770
Bitch!

23
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,770
I remember that talk show.

24
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,210
The guy advocated fines
for dog owners

25
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,450
whose dogs crap in the street.

26
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,370
Bullshit.

27
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,250
The creep was defending the idea
that women are inferior to men.

28
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,050
Rubbish.

29
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,690
If you'd let me get a word in...

30
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,210
Who rattled your cage!

31
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,770
Should cut your hands off.

32
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,250
Beating your own mother!

33
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,250
That frock was far too gaudy anyway.

34
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,010
At your age,
you should know what suits you.

35
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,170
Can't you stop, you cow?

36
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,730
Wasn't ruining that enough for you?

37
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,890
- I wish...
- What?

38
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,890
You dare n't say it?

39
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,290
Don't bother.
I know what you wish.

40
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,410
I could have had a heart attack
from the agitation.

41
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,850
If that's what you want,
go ahead!

42
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,650
Stop it, Mama,
you don't know what you're saying.

43
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,370
There's a real hole here.

44
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,930
Here, too.

45
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,410
Sorry.

46
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,850
But why do you do these things?

47
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,530
Why do you do these things?

48
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,770
I'm sorry.
Truly sorry.

49
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,050
Let me look.

50
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,570
Never mind that.

51
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,410
That's how it is.
We're a hot-blooded family.

52
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,650
Come on, stop crying.

53
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,010
I'll make some coffee.

54
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,290
We'll have a cup together. Okay?

55
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,850
Nothing in life comes free.

56
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,090
You'll just have to give
more private lessons.

57
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,890
Your vanity must not
stop us buying our apartment.

58
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,970
You can't contradict me there.

59
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,330
I paid this month's instalment
long ago, don't worry.

60
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,210
In any case,
the dress only cost 6,500.

61
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,090
I'll pay the remainder
back in tomorrow.

62
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,210
I don't understand

63
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,450
why someone of your standing
slaps make-up on

64
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,970
and fritters money away

65
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,930
on frocks that will soon be
out of fashion.

66
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,890
I'd be wearing that dress for years.
The cut was so classical.

67
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,130
It was ageless.

68
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,450
If memory serves me right,

69
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,530
you used to have a dress
just like it. Remember?

70
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,410
You must be dreaming.

71
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,010
It was a designer label.
The finishing was remarkable.

72
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,290
It would have lasted forever.

73
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,370
Do you still need the light?

74
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,770
Did they really annoy you today?

75
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,450
No more than usual.

76
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,770
Did you have the Schober girl?
lsn't Friday her day?

77
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,970
Well?

78
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,170
She's not untalented.

79
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,210
She has a surprising affinity
for Schubert.

80
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,850
Schubert's your department,
don't forget.

81
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,850
That's not for you to say.

82
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,610
You're hardly a judge
of what is my department musically.

83
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,370
If you want your pupils
to have a career instead of you...

84
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,210
No one must surpass you, my girl.

85
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,090
Don't be dizzy...

86
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,370
Don't worry, Mama.

87
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,250
THE PIANO TEACHER

88
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,730
A little less pedal
wouldn't go amiss.

89
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,730
It's not enough
just to take your foot off.

90
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,610
A note may not be
as long as it is written

91
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,650
and may not be marked
as long as it should be held.

92
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,530
from the novel by ELFRIEDE JELINEK

93
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,090
"Dogs are barking,

94
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,610
"Rattling their chains.

95
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,050
"People are sleeping

96
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,770
"In their beds."

97
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,770
Do you have no ear
for what coldness is?

98
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,650
Or maybe you're just sloppy?

99
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,170
And let go.

100
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,050
The music is not purely descriptive.

101
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,010
And it's not drenched
in indifference and sentimentality.

102
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,690
And let go.

103
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:04,970
You see?

104
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,810
"Dogs are barking,

105
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,890
"Rattling their chains.

106
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,770
"People are sleeping

107
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,730
"In their beds."

108
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,890
A wrong note in Beethoven
is better than bad interpretation.

109
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,770
You play only phrases.

110
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,690
Ignore the structure
and you'll ruin the sonata.

111
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,450
Back to the top of the page.

112
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,090
I guessed you were for the recital.

113
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,730
Allow me to introduce...

114
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,330
Professor, please, do come in.

115
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,690
Hello, Auntie.

116
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,130
And your mother. Good evening.

117
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,250
You've met my nephew?

118
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,970
I was about to introduce myself.
My name's Walter Klemmer.

119
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,850
At the risk of seeming prosaic,

120
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,210
after sampling spiritual
nourishment of such quality,

121
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,090
I've organised,
for the interval, a buffet

122
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,690
to sustain the artists

123
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,850
and, I hope,
for your pleasure, too.

124
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,650
Through here.

125
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,690
My husband's very particular...

126
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,010
Excuse me, Auntie.

127
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,250
Sorry to interrupt but I can't wait.

128
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,250
I hope it's not too forward of me
to kiss the hand

129
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,810
that plays such Bach.

130
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,530
You can stop now.

131
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,410
Where do you get
such unfashionable enthusiasm?

132
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,290
I'm delighted
the tradition of recitals lives on.

133
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,370
It was practically extinct.

134
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,810
The masters die, then their music.

135
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,690
People today
only ever listen to pop or rock.

136
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,490
You're right.
Families like this are no more.

137
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,970
Generations of laryngologists

138
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,250
toiled over Beethoven's
last quartets.

139
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,570
Now, at best, academics
stamp their feet in time

140
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,850
to the trumpety-trumps
of Bruckner.

141
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,130
Disdaining Bruckner is immature,

142
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,250
Mr... Klemmer?

143
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,330
Tell me, what enables you
to talk about music so precociously?

144
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,530
Your Aunt said you studied...

145
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,770
Low voltage, professor.
Low voltage.

146
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,410
It was made between 1 620 and 1 630
by Marcel Pichler.

147
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,570
From Hallein. A rare piece.

148
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,010
It is played

149
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,410
Iike a cello.

150
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,650
Its common name is
leg viol or quinton.

151
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,090
Recently, I found a painting
that exactly shows this instrument.

152
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,170
Not this type of instrument. I mean,
specifically this instrument.

153
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,490
The painting depicts
a concert of viole da gamba

154
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,810
at the court of Duke Augustus
von Braunschweig-Wolfenbuttel.

155
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,370
- Can I fetch you something?
- Not at all. Why?

156
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,410
It's fascinating.

157
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,250
Look at them.

158
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,650
Do they give a fig
about the benefits of illness?

159
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,810
Have you read Adorno

160
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,290
on Schumann's Fantasia in C Major?

161
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,810
He talks of his twilight.

162
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,970
It's not Schumann bereft of reason,
but just before.

163
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,890
A fraction before.

164
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,450
He knows he's losing his mind.

165
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,010
It torments him
but he clings on, one last time.

166
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,570
It's being aware
of what it means to lose oneself

167
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,050
before being completely abandoned.

168
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,970
I'd say you are a good teacher.

169
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,570
Thank you.

170
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,530
You talk about things
as if they were yours. It's rare.

171
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,250
And I think you know it.

172
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,530
Schubert and Schumann
are my favourites, that's all.

173
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,970
Since my father died
completely mad in Steinhof asylum,

174
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,410
I can talk easily about the twilight
of the mind, can't I?

175
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,290
If you'd really prefer not to eat,

176
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,570
perhaps you'd care
for a drink of something?

177
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,570
Go ahead.

178
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,370
I had to sing for my supper.

179
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,050
Dr. Blonsky with his instrument
fetish is such a bore.

180
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,810
Honestly,

181
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,530
Klemmer, or whatever he's called,
seems a bit of a leech?

182
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,650
Walter studies
at the Engineering School.

183
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,490
But his musicality
keeps up with technology,

184
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,770
as you will understand
when you listen to him play.

185
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,450
Over to you, Walter.

186
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,370
My uncle exaggerates shamelessly.

187
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,130
After the professor's performance,
I feel doubly amateur.

188
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,690
I had intended to play for you
Schonberg's Opus 33b,

189
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,450
so that my wrong notes
might go unnoticed.

190
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,370
Not very funny, I know.

191
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,850
But a discussion of
Schubert and Schumann's madness

192
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,210
left me deeply impressed.

193
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,690
I have decided to drop Schonberg

194
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,130
for my favourite piece by Schubert:

195
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,850
the Scherzo
from the Sonata in A Major.

196
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,290
"...Dreaming of what they don't
have, replenished of good and bad.

197
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,290
"And next morning, all flown away."

198
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,890
And here,
the mood switches to irony.

199
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,650
D... D... D...

200
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,490
"So what? So what?

201
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,250
"They've had their pleasure."

202
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,210
That's the obstinacy
of the complacent middle-class.

203
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,370
"And they hope
that what they left behind

204
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,050
"Might be waiting for them
on the pillows."

205
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,410
Excuse me, Professor.

206
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,770
Can I have a word?

207
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,930
Go ahead.

208
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,290
Anna says you may not let her play
in the jubilee concert.

209
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,170
I said a soloist
needs more than talent.

210
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,930
She doesn't practice enough?

211
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,250
Only she can tell.

212
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,530
She works 8 hours a day.

213
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,010
It's the end result that counts,
not the hours.

214
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,690
For her, only music counts.
Look at her.

215
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,770
Schubert isn't a walk in the park.

216
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,890
I didn't say you wouldn't play.

217
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,490
We'll see how you gel
with the singer.

218
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,850
Excuse me, I have a rehearsal.
Goodbye.

219
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,530
The Professor is right.

220
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,530
Without total commitment,
you won't get anywhere.

221
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,130
Wipe your nose.
What do you look like?

222
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,930
Your mother wants you to call her.

223
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,290
I've only just arrived.

224
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,890
I don't know.
At least 3 hours.

225
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,890
In that case, I'll take a taxi.

226
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,890
I'm not a baby.

227
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,850
I have to go now.

228
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,890
Can we play the trill the same?
I'll start on the upper note.

229
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:02,330
"Bark me away, you waking dogs,

230
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:10,130
"Don't let me rest
in the sleeping hours!

231
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:21,410
"I've reached the end of dreams.

232
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:32,690
"What will I do
amongst the sleepers?

233
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:41,810
"I've reached the end of dreams.

234
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:54,130
"What will I do
amongst the sleepers?"

235
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,810
Sorry to disturb you.

236
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,610
What is it?

237
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,170
Professor Kohut?

238
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,330
What do you want?

239
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,170
At the Conservatory,
no one interrupts lessons.

240
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,170
I apologise. I am very sorry

241
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,010
but I wanted to come to you
rather than ask just anybody.

242
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,450
About what?

243
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,770
The entrance exam.
I want to join your master class.

244
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,970
That's very flattering, young man.

245
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,850
I hope your interruption

246
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,850
is not to arouse interest
your talents don't merit.

247
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,330
Application forms are available
in the secretary's office.

248
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,250
First floor, door 1 1 .

249
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,450
Please excuse us,
we have work to do.

250
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,930
Continue.

251
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,530
Go on.

252
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,170
"How hath the tempest riven

253
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,730
"The grey robe of the sky!

254
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,250
"The clouds embattled fly

255
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,250
"In wild disorder driven."

256
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,450
- Mr. Walter Klemmer?
- That's correct.

257
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,850
Please...

258
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,530
Your programme
is particularly difficult.

259
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,810
Where do you wish to begin?

260
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,570
Wherever you prefer.

261
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,530
Professor, it's your class
that Mr. Klemmer wishes to join:

262
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,410
which piece
would you like to hear first?

263
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,810
I don't mind.
The first on the list.

264
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,450
Go ahead.

265
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,250
Well?

266
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,370
Stunningly brilliant.

267
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,890
No, seriously,
I think it wasn't too bad.

268
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,050
He just put "private lessons".

269
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,690
That's even more remarkable.

270
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:19,930
I don't know how seriously
he takes his engineering

271
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,250
but for someone whose priority
is not the piano, bravo.

272
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,490
It's amazing.

273
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,130
I quite agree.
He truly is very talented.

274
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,570
Ladies? Gentlemen?

275
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,730
- I vote for.
- Yes, me too.

276
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,450
No doubt about it.

277
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,250
What do you say?

278
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,330
Your opinion counts most.
He's applying to join your class.

279
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,810
After such euphoria,
it's hard to voice reservations.

280
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,650
I can't say
I totally share your enthusiasm.

281
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,690
Clearly he doesn't lack talent
but I wonder,

282
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,050
and I ask you,
what does he expect from us?

283
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,290
For a professional career,
he's too old.

284
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,490
By accepting him, we'll reject
a more motivated student.

285
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:07,410
And, frankly, I find his histrionics
suspicious or even unpleasant.

286
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,730
I don't see what you mean.

287
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,850
In the Andantino, there were
no histrionics, as you put it.

288
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,890
Everyone knows
our views on Schubert diverge.

289
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,090
Please, let's not waste time.
20 people are waiting.

290
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,530
I feel unable
to nurture the artistic temperament

291
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,210
or virtuosity of Mr. Klemmer.

292
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,370
Dinner's ready!

293
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,530
Coming, Mama!

294
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,530
Sit down, I'll bring the sauce.

295
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,410
Can I switch off the TV?

296
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,410
If it bothers you.

297
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,810
Don't you like that?

298
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,530
I'm tired.

299
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,010
You look it.

300
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,610
Are the auditions so exhausting?

301
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,490
Boring, rather.

302
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,250
That's tiring, too.

303
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,010
What's wrong with you?

304
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,450
- What do you mean?
- Look.

305
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,450
Is that why you're in a bad mood?

306
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,530
You might be more careful.

307
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,930
It's not very appetising.

308
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,450
"Mare on heat seeks ardent,
successful stallion,

309
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,490
"for jumping and dressage.

310
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,770
"Must be 8 inches."

311
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,130
Hello, Mr. Naprawnik.

312
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,690
Who's she?

313
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,770
My piano teacher.

314
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,850
Don't pick out
the inner voices so much.

315
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,850
Do you know where the melody is?

316
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,730
It sounds
as clear as a muddy windscreen.

317
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,690
Probably due to the images
lodged in your mind.

318
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,650
You have one approach for Bach,
Beethoven and the others.

319
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,410
What made you want to study music?

320
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,610
Your meagre talent?
I assure you it's not worth it.

321
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,650
Take a job playing in a strip joint

322
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,730
and stop wasting my time.

323
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,530
What?

324
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,890
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

325
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,890
For earlier...
At the newsagents.

326
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,170
Why?

327
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,810
Why are you sorry?

328
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,170
What for?

329
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,410
It doesn't work like that.

330
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,490
Sorry isn't enough,
if I don't know why.

331
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,250
Are you sorry because you're a pig?

332
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,730
Or because your friends are pigs?

333
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,530
Or because all women are bitches
for making you a pig?

334
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,650
Or just because you got caught?

335
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:57,890
The lesson is ended.

336
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,050
I propose
your mother comes to see me.

337
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,930
Maybe she can shed
some light on this.

338
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,450
Well?

339
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,810
What are you sorry for?

340
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,650
I'm listening.

341
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,290
The silence is deafening.

342
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,330
See you next time,
along with your mother.

343
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,370
Now, please remove yourself.

344
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,770
I'll need my break to recover.

345
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,370
Goodbye.

346
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,810
This time I'm expected.

347
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,970
The break's not over yet.

348
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,930
And the lesson hasn't begun.

349
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,370
Can I take out my scores
while I'm waiting?

350
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,530
You know I voted against you?

351
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,810
I don't believe
you're serious about music

352
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,730
but rather about the kudos
it brings.

353
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,690
You know that's untrue.

354
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,730
And even if it were true,

355
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,330
would it be such a shameful motive?

356
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,970
Yes.

357
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,850
What have you brought?

358
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,730
You should forget Schubert.

359
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,930
- Schonberg is all...
- I fought to win your attention.

360
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,730
Give me a chance.

361
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,930
I know you're not as indifferent
as you pretend.

362
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,570
I neglected my studies for you.

363
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,090
It's the truth!

364
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,090
You may think it's ridiculous,

365
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,850
but since the recital
at the Blonskys,

366
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,650
I've had you stuck in my mind
like a nut on a bolt.

367
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,810
I apologise for being so technical.

368
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,770
I never intended to apply here.

369
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,090
Stop lying, it won't wash.

370
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,050
I'm not lying.

371
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,410
For next time,
find a copy of Opus 1 9.

372
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,370
Let's talk first.

373
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,370
I can't see the point.

374
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,410
Don't just stand there.
Sit down and begin.

375
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,930
Is this your last lesson?

376
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,370
Please.

377
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,370
Pretend you have a migraine
or something.

378
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:22,890
It's lovely out.

379
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,170
Either you play
or my migraine will end this lesson.

380
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,410
It's bound to finish late.

381
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,410
Today's
our first Mendelssohn rehearsal.

382
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:37,650
So, don't call up every 5 minutes.
It's embarrassing.

383
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,010
Viora of the Philharmonic's coming.
He'll think I'm a little girl.

384
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:46,690
Is that clear?

385
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,770
If it ends late, take a taxi.

386
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:59,650
I adore lying in the name of love.
I'm so happy for you.

387
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,770
If she calls after 10, don't answer.
Is that okay?

388
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,410
It will be a pleasure.

389
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,930
Good evening, this is Mrs. Kohut.

390
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,890
May I speak to my daughter?

391
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,010
What's wrong?

392
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:37,650
What the...?

393
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,730
Shit!

394
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,810
Stay there!

395
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,690
Stay there, cunt!

396
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:11,210
Are you crazy or something?

397
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,930
Your father died this afternoon.

398
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,410
Above all, keep calm.

399
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,570
It's so inconsiderate of you!

400
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,210
Think of the consequences!

401
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,170
Kind of you
to honour us with your presence.

402
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,330
Might we know what kept you?

403
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,130
Stop blubbing! What happened?

404
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,730
I have diarrhoea.

405
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,490
Are you scared or what?

406
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,090
A pianist needs solid nerves.

407
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:22,050
- How can I perform after...
- Don't overdo it.

408
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,930
We should be going up.

409
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,490
Don't be so pathetic.

410
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,930
They won't bite. It's a rehearsal.

411
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,770
Did I overestimate you?

412
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,730
"Dogs are barking

413
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:40,610
"Rattling their chains.

414
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,290
"People are sleeping

415
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:48,410
"In their beds.

416
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:59,730
"Dreaming of what they don't have,

417
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:07,250
"Replenished of good and bad."

418
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,690
"Why do I avoid the roads

419
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:57,250
"Where other travellers go,

420
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:04,370
"Seek out hidden paths

421
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:09,170
"Through snowbound rock outcrops?

422
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:13,930
"Seek out hidden paths

423
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,890
"Through snowbound rock outcrops?

424
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:30,730
"And yet, I've done nothing

425
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:35,410
"To make me flee my fellow men.

426
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:44,970
"What is this foolish desire

427
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:49,490
"Driving me into the wilderness?"

428
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:59,770
You think me devoid of sensitivity
and indeed I can be superficial.

429
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,610
You see, I admit it.

430
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:06,210
But telling me to forget Schubert
was atrociously unfair.

431
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,490
It's quite the contrary.

432
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:11,690
There are days,
like after our first lesson, when...

433
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,450
The sight of blood makes me ill.
Go to her.

434
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,410
Be her brave protector.

435
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,850
- What happened?
- Let me.

436
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,210
Call a doctor.

437
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:39,570
Don't stare, there's nothing to see.
Go back to the hall.

438
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:31,450
Come on.

439
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,170
Wait.

440
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,410
Why?

441
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,090
Stop it!

442
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:14,810
If you don't stop immediately,
I'll leave.

443
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,450
Look at me, not your penis.

444
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:32,930
Be quiet.

445
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:35,250
Don't move or I'll leave.

446
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,090
I love you.

447
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,450
No one has...

448
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:07,450
If you won't be quiet,
you'll end up all alone here.

449
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,570
Why do you hurt me?

450
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,730
I can't hold back.

451
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,730
I said, silence!

452
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:21,210
Keep going. Come here.

453
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,730
That's it. It's coming.

454
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:52,370
Keep going. Don't stop!

455
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,050
I'll write down
what you can do to me.

456
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,770
All my desires on paper
for you to peruse at will.

457
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,930
You don't like that?

458
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,890
You can't leave me like this.

459
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:06,490
Come on.

460
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,850
I've no desire to touch that now.

461
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,330
Keep going, please.

462
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:13,330
Out of the question!

463
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:20,970
Hands off.

464
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,410
Or we never see each other again.

465
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:29,450
It's totally sick
what you're doing here.

466
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:32,410
And it hurts!

467
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:34,530
I sympathise.

468
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:46,650
Stop it.

469
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,130
Don't be stupid.
You're spoiling it.

470
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,050
I won't touch you again.

471
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:09,810
I want you to stay like that,
that's all.

472
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,090
Facing me!

473
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:21,970
Don't put it away.

474
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,490
It's not me who's stupid.

475
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,610
It's you.

476
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:38,410
You should know
what you can and can't do to a man.

477
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,170
- You bitch!
- Shut up!

478
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:43,610
The playing field has to be level.

479
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:46,930
If you think...

480
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:50,370
Wait.

481
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,490
I won't move, I promise.

482
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,610
I won't say a word.

483
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:17,610
You will receive my instructions.

484
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:20,530
By letter.

485
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:23,730
Or face to face.
Or maybe over the phone.

486
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:29,010
Now, you can put it away.

487
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:31,930
Facing me.

488
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:29,530
How about a little smile?

489
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,330
Go on.

490
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,690
Don't be so serious, pretty lady.

491
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,890
Next time, we'll do much better.
I promise.

492
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:03,770
Practice will make you perfect.

493
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:10,170
At least 2 months, with no guarantee
of complete recovery.

494
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,210
That's terrible.

495
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:17,050
And she really was quite good.
She has the nerve.

496
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:21,370
She played amazingly yesterday
despite nearly not making it.

497
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,250
Pull yourself together.
You're no use to Anna

498
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,370
if you break down like that.

499
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:33,210
For the moment, we must wait.

500
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,970
She mustn't neglect her left hand.

501
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,170
That's always her weak point.

502
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,330
Also, she'll be scarred for life.

503
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:43,250
Just imagine.
A pianist with a disfigured hand.

504
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:46,010
She's hardly attractive.
Her only attribute

505
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,970
was her talent.

506
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,290
That's why we sacrificed everything.

507
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,930
She sacrificed everything.

508
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,370
Sorry?

509
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:58,650
You said "we".
It's Anna who sacrificed everything.

510
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,450
Yes, naturally.

511
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,210
Who would do such a thing?

512
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:06,610
The police say it must have been
another student

513
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,290
acting out of jealousy.

514
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,530
Can you imagine it?

515
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:14,490
Being so evil?

516
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:18,730
She's always been a loner.
She hardly has any friends.

517
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:21,250
They'll find the man who did it.

518
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:24,330
He deserves his hands chopping off.

519
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:29,090
My next lesson is waiting.
I'll have to ask you to leave.

520
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:32,530
Tell Anna she's welcome to drop in
when she's better.

521
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,370
Remind her about her left hand.

522
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,610
I'll tell her.
Thank you very much.

523
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:46,530
She'll come by.
She admires you so much.

524
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,530
Chin up, Mrs. Schober.

525
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:53,290
Who will replace Anna
for the concert?

526
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,570
No one.

527
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:58,090
No student could
at such short notice.

528
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:01,730
I've been asked to stand in
for the singer's sake.

529
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:04,490
That's very good.
Anna will be pleased.

530
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:23,290
Stop.

531
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:32,370
Back to the beginning.

532
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:42,450
You gladly ignore the dynamics.
What does it say?

533
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,170
- Piano.
- Exactly. And then?

534
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:48,890
Forte-piano.

535
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:49,970
And then?

536
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:51,010
Pianissimo.

537
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,450
And diminuendo

538
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,410
and mezzo-forte, forte,

539
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,930
fortissimo, sforzatissimo.

540
01:16:57,170 --> 01:17:00,770
Schubert's dynamics range from
scream to whisper not loud to soft.

541
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,130
Anarchy hardly seems your forte.
Why not stick to Clementi?

542
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:08,490
Schubert was quite ugly.
Did you know?

543
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:11,730
With your looks,
nothing can ever hurt you.

544
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,970
Why destroy
what could bring us together?

545
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,370
- Mannerism is no...
- Why can't I look at you?

546
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:27,130
Because if I do, I won't resist the
temptation to kiss you on the neck.

547
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:30,730
May I kiss you on the neck?

548
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:53,890
Can I get you a glass of water?

549
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:15,690
Thanks.

550
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,010
When can I see you?

551
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:22,050
Let's call each other.

552
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:25,370
Let's go away this weekend.
Just you and l.

553
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,690
I can't,
I'm going out with my mother.

554
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,090
Cancel.

555
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,370
Forget your mother. Think of us.

556
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,450
We must make up for lost time.

557
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:36,570
Do you mean me?
I must make up for lost time?

558
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:40,010
Darling!
Stop always thinking of others,

559
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,410
your mother, your scruples...

560
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,730
You talk of anarchy
but sacrifice love to be with Mama.

561
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:50,570
Let yourself go.
Allow yourself feelings for once.

562
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,490
Don't be such a leech.

563
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:59,330
You cough because you're uptight.

564
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:02,450
I have no feelings.
Get that into your head.

565
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:05,570
If ever I do,
they won't defeat my intelligence.

566
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:09,690
I love you.
Don't be so cowardly.

567
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:14,290
Is what you've written
just as cowardly?

568
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:20,090
Don't touch it!

569
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:21,890
Not now.

570
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:25,490
I want you to read it alone.

571
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,290
Now, get stuck in to Schubert.

572
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,930
That's all you may do in this room.

573
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:49,730
Piano.

574
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,650
Brahms would say:
"Con intimissimo sentimento."

575
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,170
Are you mad? What are you doing?

576
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:58,930
I followed you.

577
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:00,890
I said we'd speak on the phone.

578
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:04,170
You can't drive me crazy like that
and then run off.

579
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:06,850
Drive you crazy?

580
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:10,810
Let's go somewhere
where we can talk in private.

581
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:15,090
Did you read the letter?

582
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:18,490
I don't want any letters.
I want us to talk!

583
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:23,250
I advise you to leave now.

584
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:27,730
Never hound the woman
you claim to love.

585
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:30,290
You should know that,
even at your age.

586
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,730
If you value my affection, go.

587
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:35,930
I'll call you tomorrow
to fix a date. Okay?

588
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:38,490
- Take your hat off.
- What?

589
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,210
Good evening.

590
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:15,170
I have matters to discuss
with Mr. Klemmer.

591
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,970
What's that supposed to mean?

592
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:21,130
We won't bother you.
We'll talk in my room.

593
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:22,730
Come on.

594
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:24,810
Excuse me.

595
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:27,850
If you try to come in,
you'll be sorry.

596
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:30,850
There's no food in.
I didn't expect visitors.

597
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,690
Don't put yourself out,
I've already eaten.

598
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:23,730
First, read the letter.

599
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,450
You've still got it?

600
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:34,970
So, read it now, please.

601
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,290
Do you want to finish me off?

602
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,370
I said
I don't want to read any letters.

603
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,770
I'm here, you're here.

604
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,490
We're made of flesh and blood.

605
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:49,090
Don't be so scared.

606
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:52,290
I'm not. I want all you want.
But read it first.

607
01:23:58,050 --> 01:24:00,130
Is that why we barricaded the door?

608
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:01,810
Perhaps.

609
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:05,650
Please!

610
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:11,650
I don't know how much longer
I want to play this game.

611
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:24,250
Heavy.

612
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:27,970
Sit down there, please.

613
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:54,210
"On the contrary, if I beg,
tighten my bonds, please.

614
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:58,610
"Adjust the belt
by at least 2 or 3 holes.

615
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:01,290
"The tighter the better.

616
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:05,210
"Then, gag me with some
stockings I will have ready.

617
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:10,210
"Stuff them in so hard
that I'm incapable...

618
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:12,490
"of making any sound.

619
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:17,250
"Next, take off the blindfold,
please,

620
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:20,370
"and sit down on my face

621
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:24,530
"and punch me in the stomach

622
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:27,930
"to force me
to thrust my tongue in your behind."

623
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:51,730
Is this supposed to be serious?

624
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,290
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

625
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:00,530
You want a slap?

626
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:22,730
"For that is my dearest wish.

627
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:25,930
"Hands and feet tied behind my back

628
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:28,490
"and locked up next door
to my mother

629
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:32,530
"but out of her reach
behind my bedroom door,

630
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:34,210
"till the next morning.

631
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:38,050
"Don't worry about my mother,
she's my problem.

632
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:42,730
"Take all the door keys
with you from the apartment.

633
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,970
"Don't leave a single one here."

634
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:47,730
What will all this open up for me?

635
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:00,770
Maybe you'd open your cultured
mouth and comment on this shit.

636
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:22,610
"If you catch me
disobeying any of your orders,

637
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:25,330
"hit me, please,

638
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:28,410
"even with the back of your hand
on my face.

639
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:34,130
"Ask me why I don't cry out
to mother

640
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:37,170
"or why I don't fight back.

641
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:39,690
"Above all, say things like that,

642
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:43,930
"so that I realise
just how powerless I am."

643
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:45,970
What's going on in there?

644
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,530
Open up! Move that chest.

645
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:50,530
Don't you want to let her in?

646
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,970
Do you want me
to hit you in front of her?

647
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:56,170
Calm down!
Be quiet and watch the TV!

648
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:58,170
Open up or you'll be sorry.

649
01:28:58,410 --> 01:28:59,450
Stop making a fuss!

650
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:00,850
Incredible!

651
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:10,290
Do you have no sense of decency?

652
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:12,610
Invading people's homes like this.

653
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:14,970
The sheer nerve of it!

654
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:32,450
Are you angry with me?

655
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,050
I hope you're not.

656
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:40,730
It's not very well written, I know.

657
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:43,810
I'm a pianist, not a poet.

658
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:50,290
After all,
love is built on banal things.

659
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:56,850
Think it over.
You have my phone number.

660
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,650
Like I said,
I want everything you want.

661
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:08,210
I have all we need.

662
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:14,490
But it can wait till tomorrow.

663
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:24,450
Aren't you talking to me?

664
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:32,850
Do I disgust you?

665
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:37,090
That's not necessary.

666
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:41,170
The urge to be beaten
has been in me for years.

667
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:49,850
I waited for you, you know?

668
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:56,650
It's not a joke, all I wrote.
You know that.

669
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:01,770
From now on, you give the orders.

670
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:08,530
From now on,
you choose what I am to wear.

671
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,530
What colour do you prefer?
You never said.

672
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:18,570
You're not talking to me?
You're angry?

673
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:25,650
Say something then.

674
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:29,330
You're sick.

675
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:32,010
You need treatment.

676
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:45,970
If you want to hit me, hit me.

677
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:51,250
I don't want to soil my hands.

678
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:55,970
No one would touch your sort,
even with gloves on.

679
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:07,850
I swear I loved you.

680
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,770
You don't even know what it is.

681
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:15,730
Right now, you repulse me.

682
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:21,450
Fuck it.

683
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:40,130
...came to North America
with the Spanish.

684
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:43,170
Left to roam free,
they became the famous Mustang.

685
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:47,890
Today's cowboys'most loyal
companion is the quarterhorse.

686
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:51,610
Very fast overshort distances
and with good stamina...

687
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:31,290
You really are quite shameless.

688
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:37,130
What have you done with him?

689
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:42,170
Is he still in your room?

690
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,010
It wouldn't surprise me.

691
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:50,210
Nothing surprises me any more.

692
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:00,690
But you can do what you want.

693
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:02,170
At your age.

694
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:12,490
Good Lord.

695
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:17,530
All those sacrifices for this.

696
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:22,290
That's what you get in reward.

697
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,570
You carry on like that.

698
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:34,930
You can set up a bordello here.

699
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:38,890
Who cares
what the neighbours think!

700
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:41,690
As always, you do as you like!

701
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:43,330
I love you.

702
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:47,530
Stop that! Have you gone insane?

703
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:55,890
Don't be so filthy,
you're out of your mind!

704
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:58,610
Shut up. I love you.

705
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:00,530
I love you, too.

706
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:04,970
But stop this now.

707
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:08,170
You're mad!

708
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:53,290
You're mad.

709
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,170
You're completely mad.

710
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:11,170
Go to sleep now.

711
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:17,010
You're going to need
all your energy.

712
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:23,770
Even if you're just standing in,
you must be well prepared.

713
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:27,850
You never know
who might be in the audience.

714
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:00,890
I saw the hairs on your sex.

715
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:22,530
Can I have a word?

716
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,610
Someone to see you.

717
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:30,010
Is that your little sister?

718
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:31,890
Don't run away, he's coming.

719
01:40:42,490 --> 01:40:44,410
- What do you want?
- Speak to you.

720
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:46,850
I'm listening.

721
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:49,770
Not here, I can't.

722
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:52,650
Over there.

723
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:58,850
How did you manage to find me?

724
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:02,090
Just there.

725
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:04,210
Go on in.

726
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:14,450
Forgive me for the letter.

727
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:19,570
I'm an idiot. I shouldn't have
done that to you out of the blue.

728
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:24,210
Like you said,
we should have talked first.

729
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:36,090
Forgive me.

730
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:42,010
What are you doing?

731
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:44,450
Stop it. Get up now.

732
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:45,970
Come on.

733
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:49,290
Come on top of me.

734
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:52,730
- You want me, don't you?
- You're mad.

735
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:56,730
Come on. I love you.

736
01:41:58,090 --> 01:42:00,650
I'll never write anything
you don't want.

737
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:03,650
You tell me what you want, okay?

738
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:08,330
Someone might come in.
You're being ridiculous.

739
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:10,050
Get up.

740
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:18,770
Hang on, let me do it.

741
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:21,530
Let me do it, I said.

742
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:46,690
I can't, not here.

743
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:48,090
Stop it. I can't.

744
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:51,810
- It doesn't matter.
- I can't do it here.

745
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:57,610
I know you want to protect us,

746
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:01,010
but I don't care if people catch us.
I don't care.

747
01:43:02,490 --> 01:43:03,690
I love you.

748
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:21,970
I love you, too.

749
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:38,210
Come on.

750
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:51,970
You have to help me.

751
01:44:24,370 --> 01:44:27,010
- I don't believe it.
- I'm sorry.

752
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:31,490
Don't look.

753
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:36,770
Don't look.

754
01:44:55,090 --> 01:44:56,730
I must really disgust you.

755
01:44:57,370 --> 01:44:59,370
- No woman ever puked it back.
- Sorry.

756
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:01,730
I don't know what happened.

757
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:07,930
I'm clean.

758
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:14,330
I'm all clean.

759
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:16,970
Like a baby.

760
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:20,410
Inside as well as outside.

761
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:22,810
For you and thanks to you, darling.

762
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:26,250
Do you like me calling you darling?

763
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,490
It's absolutely marvellous.

764
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:30,410
You must be patient.

765
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:34,410
I'll give you all the names,
we'll play all the games you want.

766
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:37,530
You know you really stink?

767
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:43,290
Sorry, you stink so much,
no one will ever come close to you.

768
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:47,250
You'd better leave town
until you don't stink so bad.

769
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:50,450
Rinse your mouth more often,

770
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:52,810
not just when my cock
makes you puke.

771
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:39,130
Who is it?

772
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:40,290
Open up.

773
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:44,050
- Open up now!
- What do you want?

774
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:46,850
I said, open the door!

775
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:51,810
Quiet!
You'll wake the whole building.

776
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:53,250
I'm opening it.

777
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:00,650
Don't do that again, okay?

778
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:03,250
- What do you mean?
- Shut up, you sad cow!

779
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:06,250
Just then,

780
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:09,290
I was under your window

781
01:47:10,370 --> 01:47:13,450
and I was jerking off.
That's what you want, huh?

782
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:16,330
You want to...
Is that it?

783
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:20,290
You're a witch, a pervert!

784
01:47:22,570 --> 01:47:25,610
You want to give everyone
your illness, don't you?

785
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:27,250
- Not me!
- I did apologise.

786
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:29,370
Fuck your stupid apologies!

787
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:31,850
Wasn't last night enough for you?

788
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:35,370
Will you make this a habit?
Screaming the house down.

789
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:37,250
Go back to bed!

790
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:38,410
Walter, please.

791
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:41,650
- Get out!
- Be off with you! Now!

792
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:43,330
Not as you imagined?

793
01:47:43,570 --> 01:47:44,570
We'll see about this.

794
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:47,130
The police will put a stop to this.

795
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:50,090
This is nothing to do with you.

796
01:47:55,490 --> 01:47:56,850
Forget your mother.

797
01:47:57,450 --> 01:47:59,730
We have time. We have all night.

798
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:06,970
Let's pick up where we left off.

799
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:10,930
Is this really
what you had imagined?

800
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:13,930
What then?

801
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:15,610
You'll be sorry.

802
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:18,930
Just because we're women doesn't
mean you'll get away with it.

803
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:20,010
Let me go.

804
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:25,010
This is unbelievable!

805
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:28,810
At least this one has a key.

806
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:30,050
Open up!

807
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:32,730
How about one
for your daughter's room?

808
01:48:35,690 --> 01:48:37,250
That's that dealt with.

809
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:42,650
"As for my mother,
pay no attention to her." Yes?

810
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:46,250
Am I quoting you exactly?

811
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:01,730
"Give me lots of slaps, darling.

812
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:05,370
"Hit me hard..." No.

813
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:07,970
"Hit me around the face
and hit me hard."

814
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:14,450
At your service, dear lady.

815
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:22,090
Is that what you want?

816
01:49:22,330 --> 01:49:23,130
Stop, please.

817
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:26,690
What then?

818
01:49:26,930 --> 01:49:29,530
Not that. Stop, I beg you.

819
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:38,490
What are you doing?

820
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:40,770
- Shut it or I kill her!
- Murderer!

821
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:45,490
Stop.

822
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:49,370
- Where's the water?
- In the kitchen.

823
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:55,730
Don't think you'll get me going...

824
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:58,450
by flashing your pathetic body.

825
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:17,090
You know,

826
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:20,810
I do realise
that all this isn't very nice of me.

827
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:27,370
But if you're honest, you'll admit
you're partly responsible.

828
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:31,410
I mean, it's true...

829
01:50:32,730 --> 01:50:33,730
Yes or no?

830
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:34,650
Yes.

831
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:36,730
Am I right?

832
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:38,530
Yes, Walter.

833
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:49,170
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

834
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:53,050
You can't get a guy going,
then take refuge on the ice.

835
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:12,610
Not my face! Not my hands!

836
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:15,530
Murderer!

837
01:51:16,610 --> 01:51:18,370
Aren't you ashamed?

838
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:22,050
I'm begging you to stop.

839
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:25,170
Don't touch my daughter.

840
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:29,610
Leave my daughter alone.

841
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:33,850
I'm begging you.

842
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:36,010
Why do you do that?

843
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:39,530
I calm down
and you try to cross me.

844
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:44,050
Be a little cooperative, fuck it.

845
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:50,010
I'd be happy to learn to play.

846
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:53,930
But not if we only ever play
by your rules.

847
01:51:56,370 --> 01:51:59,690
You can't delve around
inside people, then reject them.

848
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:14,770
Be nice to me, please.

849
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:22,290
You can't let me go just like that.

850
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:54,570
Stop, please.

851
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:57,130
You have to give a bit.

852
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:26,650
You can't leave me all alone now.

853
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:29,330
Love me, please.

854
01:54:56,410 --> 01:54:58,970
Are you trying to tell me
I should go?

855
01:56:03,410 --> 01:56:05,530
I'd appreciate it
if you tell no one.

856
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:10,250
Anyhow, it's for your own good.

857
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:18,650
You can't humiliate
a man that way and...

858
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:21,010
It's not possible.

859
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:33,410
Will you be alright?

860
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:39,570
Do you need anything?

861
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:41,370
Okay?

862
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:46,730
You know, love isn't everything.

863
01:56:50,290 --> 01:56:51,650
See you, then.

864
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:03,970
Has he gone?

865
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:07,130
Say something. Has he gone?

866
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:12,090
Open the door.

867
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:15,090
What's wrong?

868
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:18,130
Talk to me, for God's sake.

869
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:53,170
Oh my God, child!

870
01:57:53,410 --> 01:57:55,010
What a state you're in!

871
01:57:56,010 --> 01:57:57,970
What did the bastard do to you?

872
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:06,050
Hurry, we'll miss the tram.

873
01:58:06,730 --> 01:58:08,770
I'm just having a glass of water.

874
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:15,690
Don't be so nervous.

875
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:17,850
It's only to replace someone.

876
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:57,130
I'm so looking forward
to your Schubert.

877
01:58:57,370 --> 01:59:01,250
I think I should go and take
my seat. It begins in 8 minutes.

878
01:59:01,490 --> 01:59:03,050
I'll come up with you.

879
01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:07,210
Good evening,
I'm delighted to see you here.

880
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:11,090
What about our convalescent?
She doesn't lack courage.

881
01:59:11,330 --> 01:59:14,730
She insisted on coming tonight.
To hear you play.

882
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:18,610
How are you feeling?

883
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:21,810
Sorry, let me introduce myself.

884
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:24,330
I'm Mrs. Schober.
My daughter, Anna.

885
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,170
This is my mother.

886
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:30,890
Lovely to meet you. You must be
very proud of your daughter.

887
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:33,130
Why? It's a school concert.

888
01:59:34,210 --> 01:59:36,170
She's standing in for a pupil.

889
01:59:36,690 --> 01:59:38,250
That pupil is my daughter.

890
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:39,570
Where are you sitting?

891
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:46,610
Not far from us.

892
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:50,250
It's late. We'd better go.
Can we go up together?

893
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:51,890
Are you coming, Anna?

894
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:56,490
See you later. I'll go up
with Mrs. Schober. Break a leg.

895
01:59:56,730 --> 01:59:58,130
Enjoy the concert.

896
01:59:58,370 --> 02:00:02,010
Goodbye,
it was a pleasure to see you.

897
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:22,170
There, now...

898
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:24,890
What a nice surprise!

899
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:27,450
George! Look who's here.

900
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:29,250
- Professor Kohut.
- My respects.

901
02:01:29,490 --> 02:01:32,010
Hurry up, Gerda.
Give me your coat.

902
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:34,050
I'll keep it with me.

903
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:36,970
Men! Always rushing you.
You know how it is.

904
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:39,490
Have an excellent evening.

905
02:01:39,730 --> 02:01:40,530
Come on!

906
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:42,370
See you later, I hope.

907
02:01:42,610 --> 02:01:45,770
My respects, Professor.
I can't wait to hear you play.
