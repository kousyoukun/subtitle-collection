1
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,800
Good evening, child.

2
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,200
Evening, Mama.

3
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,300
Home already? I'm so happy.

4
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,100
Not so fast.

5
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,200
Please. Leave me be.
I'm tired.

6
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,100
I can quite believe it.

7
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,700
Your last pupil left 3 hours ago.

8
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,600
Might I know
where you've been all this time?

9
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,300
Please.

10
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
No, you don't.
Not until you tell me!

11
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,600
I went for a walk. Do you mind?

12
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,600
I spent 8 hours in my cage.
I was tired and needed some air.

13
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
- For three hours?
- Absolutely!

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
Magnificent.

15
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,800
Just as I thought.

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
Where's the bankbook?

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,300
1 0,000 Schillings!

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,300
Tell me, have you lost your mind?

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Where's my grey Autumn suit?

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
No idea.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,200
Give that back.

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,500
Bitch!

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,500
I remember that talk show.

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,000
The guy advocated fines
for dog owners

25
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
whose dogs crap in the street.

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,100
Bullshit.

27
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,000
The creep was defending the idea
that women are inferior to men.

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,800
Rubbish.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,400
If you'd let me get a word in...

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,000
Who rattled your cage!

31
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,500
Should cut your hands off.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
Beating your own mother!

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,000
That frock was far too gaudy anyway.

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,800
At your age,
you should know what suits you.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,900
Can't you stop, you cow?

36
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,500
Wasn't ruining that enough for you?

37
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,600
- I wish...
- What?

38
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
You dare n't say it?

39
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't bother.
I know what you wish.

40
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,200
I could have had a heart attack
from the agitation.

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,600
If that's what you want,
go ahead!

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Stop it, Mama,
you don't know what you're saying.

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,100
There's a real hole here.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,700
Here, too.

45
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
Sorry.

46
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
But why do you do these things?

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,300
Why do you do these things?

48
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm sorry.
Truly sorry.

49
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Let me look.

50
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,300
Never mind that.

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
That's how it is.
We're a hot-blooded family.

52
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,400
Come on, stop crying.

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
I'll make some coffee.

54
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,000
We'll have a cup together. Okay?

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
Nothing in life comes free.

56
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,800
You'll just have to give
more private lessons.

57
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,600
Your vanity must not
stop us buying our apartment.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,700
You can't contradict me there.

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,100
I paid this month's instalment
long ago, don't worry.

60
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,000
In any case,
the dress only cost 6,500.

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,800
I'll pay the remainder
back in tomorrow.

62
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't understand

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
why someone of your standing
slaps make-up on

64
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,700
and fritters money away

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,700
on frocks that will soon be
out of fashion.

66
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,600
I'd be wearing that dress for years.
The cut was so classical.

67
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,900
It was ageless.

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
If memory serves me right,

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,300
you used to have a dress
just like it. Remember?

70
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,200
You must be dreaming.

71
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,800
It was a designer label.
The finishing was remarkable.

72
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,000
It would have lasted forever.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,100
Do you still need the light?

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,500
Did they really annoy you today?

75
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
No more than usual.

76
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,500
Did you have the Schober girl?
lsn't Friday her day?

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,700
Well?

78
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,900
She's not untalented.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She has a surprising affinity
for Schubert.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,600
Schubert's your department,
don't forget.

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,600
That's not for you to say.

82
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,400
You're hardly a judge
of what is my department musically.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,100
If you want your pupils
to have a career instead of you...

84
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,000
No one must surpass you, my girl.

85
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,800
Don't be dizzy...

86
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Don't worry, Mama.

87
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,000
THE PIANO TEACHER

88
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,500
A little less pedal
wouldn't go amiss.

89
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,500
It's not enough
just to take your foot off.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
A note may not be
as long as it is written

91
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,400
and may not be marked
as long as it should be held.

92
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,300
from the novel by ELFRIEDE JELINEK

93
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800
"Dogs are barking,

94
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,400
"Rattling their chains.

95
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,800
"People are sleeping

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,500
"In their beds."

97
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,500
Do you have no ear
for what coldness is?

98
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
Or maybe you're just sloppy?

99
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,900
And let go.

100
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,700
The music is not purely descriptive.

101
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,700
And it's not drenched
in indifference and sentimentality.

102
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,300
And let go.

103
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
You see?

104
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,500
"Dogs are barking,

105
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,500
"Rattling their chains.

106
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,400
"People are sleeping

107
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,400
"In their beds."

108
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,500
A wrong note in Beethoven
is better than bad interpretation.

109
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,400
You play only phrases.

110
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,300
Ignore the structure
and you'll ruin the sonata.

111
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,100
Back to the top of the page.

112
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,700
I guessed you were for the recital.

113
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
Allow me to introduce...

114
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,000
Professor, please, do come in.

115
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,300
Hello, Auntie.

116
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
And your mother. Good evening.

117
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,900
You've met my nephew?

118
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,600
I was about to introduce myself.
My name's Walter Klemmer.

119
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,500
At the risk of seeming prosaic,

120
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,900
after sampling spiritual
nourishment of such quality,

121
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,700
I've organised,
for the interval, a buffet

122
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,300
to sustain the artists

123
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,500
and, I hope,
for your pleasure, too.

124
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,300
Through here.

125
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,300
My husband's very particular...

126
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,700
Excuse me, Auntie.

127
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Sorry to interrupt but I can't wait.

128
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,900
I hope it's not too forward of me
to kiss the hand

129
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,500
that plays such Bach.

130
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,200
You can stop now.

131
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,100
Where do you get
such unfashionable enthusiasm?

132
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,900
I'm delighted
the tradition of recitals lives on.

133
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
It was practically extinct.

134
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,500
The masters die, then their music.

135
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,300
People today
only ever listen to pop or rock.

136
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,100
You're right.
Families like this are no more.

137
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Generations of laryngologists

138
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
toiled over Beethoven's
last quartets.

139
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,200
Now, at best, academics
stamp their feet in time

140
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
to the trumpety-trumps
of Bruckner.

141
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,800
Disdaining Bruckner is immature,

142
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,900
Mr... Klemmer?

143
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,000
Tell me, what enables you
to talk about music so precociously?

144
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,200
Your Aunt said you studied...

145
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Low voltage, professor.
Low voltage.

146
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,100
It was made between 1 620 and 1 630
by Marcel Pichler.

147
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,200
From Hallein. A rare piece.

148
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,700
It is played

149
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,000
Iike a cello.

150
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Its common name is
leg viol or quinton.

151
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,600
Recently, I found a painting
that exactly shows this instrument.

152
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,700
Not this type of instrument. I mean,
specifically this instrument.

153
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,000
The painting depicts
a concert of viole da gamba

154
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,400
at the court of Duke Augustus
von Braunschweig-Wolfenbuttel.

155
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,900
- Can I fetch you something?
- Not at all. Why?

156
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,000
It's fascinating.

157
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Look at them.

158
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,200
Do they give a fig
about the benefits of illness?

159
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,400
Have you read Adorno

160
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,800
on Schumann's Fantasia in C Major?

161
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
He talks of his twilight.

162
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,500
It's not Schumann bereft of reason,
but just before.

163
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,400
A fraction before.

164
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,000
He knows he's losing his mind.

165
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,600
It torments him
but he clings on, one last time.

166
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,100
It's being aware
of what it means to lose oneself

167
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,600
before being completely abandoned.

168
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,500
I'd say you are a good teacher.

169
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,100
Thank you.

170
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,100
You talk about things
as if they were yours. It's rare.

171
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,800
And I think you know it.

172
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,100
Schubert and Schumann
are my favourites, that's all.

173
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,500
Since my father died
completely mad in Steinhof asylum,

174
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
I can talk easily about the twilight
of the mind, can't I?

175
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,800
If you'd really prefer not to eat,

176
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,100
perhaps you'd care
for a drink of something?

177
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,100
Go ahead.

178
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,900
I had to sing for my supper.

179
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Dr. Blonsky with his instrument
fetish is such a bore.

180
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Honestly,

181
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,100
Klemmer, or whatever he's called,
seems a bit of a leech?

182
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,200
Walter studies
at the Engineering School.

183
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,000
But his musicality
keeps up with technology,

184
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,300
as you will understand
when you listen to him play.

185
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,000
Over to you, Walter.

186
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,900
My uncle exaggerates shamelessly.

187
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,700
After the professor's performance,
I feel doubly amateur.

188
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,200
I had intended to play for you
Schonberg's Opus 33b,

189
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,000
so that my wrong notes
might go unnoticed.

190
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,900
Not very funny, I know.

191
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
But a discussion of
Schubert and Schumann's madness

192
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,800
left me deeply impressed.

193
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,200
I have decided to drop Schonberg

194
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,700
for my favourite piece by Schubert:

195
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,400
the Scherzo
from the Sonata in A Major.

196
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,800
"...Dreaming of what they don't
have, replenished of good and bad.

197
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,800
"And next morning, all flown away."

198
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,400
And here,
the mood switches to irony.

199
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,200
D... D... D...

200
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,000
"So what? So what?

201
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,800
"They've had their pleasure."

202
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,800
That's the obstinacy
of the complacent middle-class.

203
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,900
"And they hope
that what they left behind

204
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,600
"Might be waiting for them
on the pillows."

205
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,000
Excuse me, Professor.

206
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,300
Can I have a word?

207
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,500
Go ahead.

208
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,800
Anna says you may not let her play
in the jubilee concert.

209
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,700
I said a soloist
needs more than talent.

210
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,500
She doesn't practice enough?

211
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,800
Only she can tell.

212
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,100
She works 8 hours a day.

213
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,600
It's the end result that counts,
not the hours.

214
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,200
For her, only music counts.
Look at her.

215
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,300
Schubert isn't a walk in the park.

216
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
I didn't say you wouldn't play.

217
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,000
We'll see how you gel
with the singer.

218
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,400
Excuse me, I have a rehearsal.
Goodbye.

219
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,100
The Professor is right.

220
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,100
Without total commitment,
you won't get anywhere.

221
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,700
Wipe your nose.
What do you look like?

222
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,500
Your mother wants you to call her.

223
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,800
I've only just arrived.

224
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,400
I don't know.
At least 3 hours.

225
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,400
In that case, I'll take a taxi.

226
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm not a baby.

227
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,400
I have to go now.

228
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,400
Can we play the trill the same?
I'll start on the upper note.

229
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:50,800
"Bark me away, you waking dogs,

230
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,600
"Don't let me rest
in the sleeping hours!

231
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:09,900
"I've reached the end of dreams.

232
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:21,100
"What will I do
amongst the sleepers?

233
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:30,300
"I've reached the end of dreams.

234
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:42,600
"What will I do
amongst the sleepers?"

235
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,300
Sorry to disturb you.

236
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,100
What is it?

237
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,600
Professor Kohut?

238
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,800
What do you want?

239
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,600
At the Conservatory,
no one interrupts lessons.

240
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,600
I apologise. I am very sorry

241
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,500
but I wanted to come to you
rather than ask just anybody.

242
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,900
About what?

243
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,200
The entrance exam.
I want to join your master class.

244
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,400
That's very flattering, young man.

245
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,300
I hope your interruption

246
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,300
is not to arouse interest
your talents don't merit.

247
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,800
Application forms are available
in the secretary's office.

248
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,700
First floor, door 1 1 .

249
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,900
Please excuse us,
we have work to do.

250
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,400
Continue.

251
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
Go on.

252
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,600
"How hath the tempest riven

253
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,200
"The grey robe of the sky!

254
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,700
"The clouds embattled fly

255
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,700
"In wild disorder driven."

256
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,900
- Mr. Walter Klemmer?
- That's correct.

257
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,300
Please...

258
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,000
Your programme
is particularly difficult.

259
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,300
Where do you wish to begin?

260
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,000
Wherever you prefer.

261
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,000
Professor, it's your class
that Mr. Klemmer wishes to join:

262
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,900
which piece
would you like to hear first?

263
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,300
I don't mind.
The first on the list.

264
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,900
Go ahead.

265
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,600
Well?

266
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,700
Stunningly brilliant.

267
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,200
No, seriously,
I think it wasn't too bad.

268
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,400
He just put "private lessons".

269
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,000
That's even more remarkable.

270
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,300
I don't know how seriously
he takes his engineering

271
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,600
but for someone whose priority
is not the piano, bravo.

272
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
It's amazing.

273
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,500
I quite agree.
He truly is very talented.

274
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,900
Ladies? Gentlemen?

275
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,100
- I vote for.
- Yes, me too.

276
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,800
No doubt about it.

277
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,600
What do you say?

278
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,700
Your opinion counts most.
He's applying to join your class.

279
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,200
After such euphoria,
it's hard to voice reservations.

280
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,000
I can't say
I totally share your enthusiasm.

281
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,000
Clearly he doesn't lack talent
but I wonder,

282
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,400
and I ask you,
what does he expect from us?

283
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,600
For a professional career,
he's too old.

284
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,800
By accepting him, we'll reject
a more motivated student.

285
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,800
And, frankly, I find his histrionics
suspicious or even unpleasant.

286
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,100
I don't see what you mean.

287
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,200
In the Andantino, there were
no histrionics, as you put it.

288
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,200
Everyone knows
our views on Schubert diverge.

289
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,400
Please, let's not waste time.
20 people are waiting.

290
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,900
I feel unable
to nurture the artistic temperament

291
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,600
or virtuosity of Mr. Klemmer.

292
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,700
Dinner's ready!

293
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,900
Coming, Mama!

294
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,900
Sit down, I'll bring the sauce.

295
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,800
Can I switch off the TV?

296
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
If it bothers you.

297
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,200
Don't you like that?

298
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,900
I'm tired.

299
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,400
You look it.

300
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Are the auditions so exhausting?

301
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Boring, rather.

302
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,600
That's tiring, too.

303
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,400
What's wrong with you?

304
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,800
- What do you mean?
- Look.

305
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Is that why you're in a bad mood?

306
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,900
You might be more careful.

307
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,300
It's not very appetising.

308
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,800
"Mare on heat seeks ardent,
successful stallion,

309
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,800
"for jumping and dressage.

310
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
"Must be 8 inches."

311
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,500
Hello, Mr. Naprawnik.

312
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,000
Who's she?

313
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,100
My piano teacher.

314
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,200
Don't pick out
the inner voices so much.

315
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Do you know where the melody is?

316
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,100
It sounds
as clear as a muddy windscreen.

317
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,000
Probably due to the images
lodged in your mind.

318
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,000
You have one approach for Bach,
Beethoven and the others.

319
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,700
What made you want to study music?

320
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,900
Your meagre talent?
I assure you it's not worth it.

321
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,900
Take a job playing in a strip joint

322
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,000
and stop wasting my time.

323
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,800
What?

324
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,100
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

325
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,100
For earlier...
At the newsagents.

326
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,400
Why?

327
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,100
Why are you sorry?

328
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,400
What for?

329
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,700
It doesn't work like that.

330
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,700
Sorry isn't enough,
if I don't know why.

331
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,500
Are you sorry because you're a pig?

332
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Or because your friends are pigs?

333
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,800
Or because all women are bitches
for making you a pig?

334
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,900
Or just because you got caught?

335
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,100
The lesson is ended.

336
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,300
I propose
your mother comes to see me.

337
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,200
Maybe she can shed
some light on this.

338
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,700
Well?

339
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,100
What are you sorry for?

340
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,900
I'm listening.

341
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,500
The silence is deafening.

342
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,600
See you next time,
along with your mother.

343
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,600
Now, please remove yourself.

344
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,000
I'll need my break to recover.

345
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,600
Goodbye.

346
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,100
This time I'm expected.

347
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,200
The break's not over yet.

348
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,200
And the lesson hasn't begun.

349
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,600
Can I take out my scores
while I'm waiting?

350
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
You know I voted against you?

351
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,100
I don't believe
you're serious about music

352
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,000
but rather about the kudos
it brings.

353
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,900
You know that's untrue.

354
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,000
And even if it were true,

355
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,600
would it be such a shameful motive?

356
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Yes.

357
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,100
What have you brought?

358
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You should forget Schubert.

359
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,200
- Schonberg is all...
- I fought to win your attention.

360
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,000
Give me a chance.

361
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,200
I know you're not as indifferent
as you pretend.

362
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,800
I neglected my studies for you.

363
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,300
It's the truth!

364
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,300
You may think it's ridiculous,

365
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,100
but since the recital
at the Blonskys,

366
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,900
I've had you stuck in my mind
like a nut on a bolt.

367
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,100
I apologise for being so technical.

368
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,000
I never intended to apply here.

369
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,300
Stop lying, it won't wash.

370
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,300
I'm not lying.

371
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,700
For next time,
find a copy of Opus 1 9.

372
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,600
Let's talk first.

373
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,600
I can't see the point.

374
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,700
Don't just stand there.
Sit down and begin.

375
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,200
Is this your last lesson?

376
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,600
Please.

377
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,600
Pretend you have a migraine
or something.

378
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,100
It's lovely out.

379
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Either you play
or my migraine will end this lesson.

380
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,700
It's bound to finish late.

381
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,700
Today's
our first Mendelssohn rehearsal.

382
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,900
So, don't call up every 5 minutes.
It's embarrassing.

383
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,300
Viora of the Philharmonic's coming.
He'll think I'm a little girl.

384
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,900
Is that clear?

385
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,000
If it ends late, take a taxi.

386
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,900
I adore lying in the name of love.
I'm so happy for you.

387
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,000
If she calls after 10, don't answer.
Is that okay?

388
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,700
It will be a pleasure.

389
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,100
Good evening, this is Mrs. Kohut.

390
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,000
May I speak to my daughter?

391
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,200
What's wrong?

392
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:25,800
What the...?

393
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,900
Shit!

394
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,000
Stay there!

395
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,800
Stay there, cunt!

396
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,400
Are you crazy or something?

397
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,100
Your father died this afternoon.

398
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,600
Above all, keep calm.

399
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,600
It's so inconsiderate of you!

400
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,300
Think of the consequences!

401
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,200
Kind of you
to honour us with your presence.

402
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,400
Might we know what kept you?

403
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,200
Stop blubbing! What happened?

404
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,800
I have diarrhoea.

405
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,500
Are you scared or what?

406
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,100
A pianist needs solid nerves.

407
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,100
- How can I perform after...
- Don't overdo it.

408
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,000
We should be going up.

409
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,500
Don't be so pathetic.

410
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,000
They won't bite. It's a rehearsal.

411
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,800
Did I overestimate you?

412
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:24,800
"Dogs are barking

413
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,700
"Rattling their chains.

414
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,300
"People are sleeping

415
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,500
"In their beds.

416
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:47,800
"Dreaming of what they don't have,

417
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,300
"Replenished of good and bad."

418
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,700
"Why do I avoid the roads

419
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,300
"Where other travellers go,

420
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,400
"Seek out hidden paths

421
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,200
"Through snowbound rock outcrops?

422
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:02,000
"Seek out hidden paths

423
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,900
"Through snowbound rock outcrops?

424
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:18,800
"And yet, I've done nothing

425
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,400
"To make me flee my fellow men.

426
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,900
"What is this foolish desire

427
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,400
"Driving me into the wilderness?"

428
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,700
You think me devoid of sensitivity
and indeed I can be superficial.

429
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,600
You see, I admit it.

430
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,200
But telling me to forget Schubert
was atrociously unfair.

431
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,400
It's quite the contrary.

432
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,600
There are days,
like after our first lesson, when...

433
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,400
The sight of blood makes me ill.
Go to her.

434
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,400
Be her brave protector.

435
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,800
- What happened?
- Let me.

436
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,200
Call a doctor.

437
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,500
Don't stare, there's nothing to see.
Go back to the hall.

438
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,400
Come on.

439
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,100
Wait.

440
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
Why?

441
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,000
Stop it!

442
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,800
If you don't stop immediately,
I'll leave.

443
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,400
Look at me, not your penis.

444
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,900
Be quiet.

445
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,200
Don't move or I'll leave.

446
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,000
I love you.

447
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,400
No one has...

448
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,400
If you won't be quiet,
you'll end up all alone here.

449
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,500
Why do you hurt me?

450
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,700
I can't hold back.

451
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,700
I said, silence!

452
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,200
Keep going. Come here.

453
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,700
That's it. It's coming.

454
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,300
Keep going. Don't stop!

455
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,000
I'll write down
what you can do to me.

456
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,700
All my desires on paper
for you to peruse at will.

457
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,900
You don't like that?

458
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,800
You can't leave me like this.

459
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,400
Come on.

460
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,800
I've no desire to touch that now.

461
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,300
Keep going, please.

462
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,300
Out of the question!

463
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,900
Hands off.

464
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,400
Or we never see each other again.

465
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,400
It's totally sick
what you're doing here.

466
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,400
And it hurts!

467
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,500
I sympathise.

468
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,600
Stop it.

469
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,100
Don't be stupid.
You're spoiling it.

470
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,900
I won't touch you again.

471
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,700
I want you to stay like that,
that's all.

472
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,900
Facing me!

473
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,800
Don't put it away.

474
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,300
It's not me who's stupid.

475
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,500
It's you.

476
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,300
You should know
what you can and can't do to a man.

477
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,000
- You bitch!
- Shut up!

478
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,500
The playing field has to be level.

479
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,800
If you think...

480
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,200
Wait.

481
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,300
I won't move, I promise.

482
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,500
I won't say a word.

483
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,500
You will receive my instructions.

484
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,400
By letter.

485
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,600
Or face to face.
Or maybe over the phone.

486
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,900
Now, you can put it away.

487
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,800
Facing me.

488
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
How about a little smile?

489
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,200
Go on.

490
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,500
Don't be so serious, pretty lady.

491
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,700
Next time, we'll do much better.
I promise.

492
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,600
Practice will make you perfect.

493
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,000
At least 2 months, with no guarantee
of complete recovery.

494
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,100
That's terrible.

495
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,900
And she really was quite good.
She has the nerve.

496
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,200
She played amazingly yesterday
despite nearly not making it.

497
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,100
Pull yourself together.
You're no use to Anna

498
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,200
if you break down like that.

499
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,100
For the moment, we must wait.

500
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,800
She mustn't neglect her left hand.

501
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,000
That's always her weak point.

502
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,200
Also, she'll be scarred for life.

503
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,100
Just imagine.
A pianist with a disfigured hand.

504
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,900
She's hardly attractive.
Her only attribute

505
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,800
was her talent.

506
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,100
That's why we sacrificed everything.

507
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,800
She sacrificed everything.

508
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,200
Sorry?

509
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,500
You said "we".
It's Anna who sacrificed everything.

510
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,300
Yes, naturally.

511
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,100
Who would do such a thing?

512
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,500
The police say it must have been
another student

513
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,100
acting out of jealousy.

514
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,400
Can you imagine it?

515
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,300
Being so evil?

516
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,600
She's always been a loner.
She hardly has any friends.

517
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,100
They'll find the man who did it.

518
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,200
He deserves his hands chopping off.

519
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,900
My next lesson is waiting.
I'll have to ask you to leave.

520
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,400
Tell Anna she's welcome to drop in
when she's better.

521
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,200
Remind her about her left hand.

522
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,500
I'll tell her.
Thank you very much.

523
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,400
She'll come by.
She admires you so much.

524
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,400
Chin up, Mrs. Schober.

525
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,100
Who will replace Anna
for the concert?

526
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,400
No one.

527
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,900
No student could
at such short notice.

528
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:49,600
I've been asked to stand in
for the singer's sake.

529
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,300
That's very good.
Anna will be pleased.

530
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,100
Stop.

531
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,200
Back to the beginning.

532
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,200
You gladly ignore the dynamics.
What does it say?

533
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,900
- Piano.
- Exactly. And then?

534
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,600
Forte-piano.

535
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:37,700
And then?

536
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:38,800
Pianissimo.

537
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,200
And diminuendo

538
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,200
and mezzo-forte, forte,

539
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,700
fortissimo, sforzatissimo.

540
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,500
Schubert's dynamics range from
scream to whisper not loud to soft.

541
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,900
Anarchy hardly seems your forte.
Why not stick to Clementi?

542
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,200
Schubert was quite ugly.
Did you know?

543
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,500
With your looks,
nothing can ever hurt you.

544
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,700
Why destroy
what could bring us together?

545
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,100
- Mannerism is no...
- Why can't I look at you?

546
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:14,900
Because if I do, I won't resist the
temptation to kiss you on the neck.

547
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,500
May I kiss you on the neck?

548
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,600
Can I get you a glass of water?

549
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,400
Thanks.

550
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,800
When can I see you?

551
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,800
Let's call each other.

552
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,100
Let's go away this weekend.
Just you and l.

553
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,400
I can't,
I'm going out with my mother.

554
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,800
Cancel.

555
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,100
Forget your mother. Think of us.

556
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,200
We must make up for lost time.

557
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,300
Do you mean me?
I must make up for lost time?

558
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,800
Darling!
Stop always thinking of others,

559
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,200
your mother, your scruples...

560
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,500
You talk of anarchy
but sacrifice love to be with Mama.

561
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,300
Let yourself go.
Allow yourself feelings for once.

562
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,200
Don't be such a leech.

563
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,100
You cough because you're uptight.

564
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,200
I have no feelings.
Get that into your head.

565
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,300
If ever I do,
they won't defeat my intelligence.

566
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,400
I love you.
Don't be so cowardly.

567
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,000
Is what you've written
just as cowardly?

568
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,800
Don't touch it!

569
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,600
Not now.

570
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,200
I want you to read it alone.

571
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,000
Now, get stuck in to Schubert.

572
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,700
That's all you may do in this room.

573
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,500
Piano.

574
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,400
Brahms would say:
"Con intimissimo sentimento."

575
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,900
Are you mad? What are you doing?

576
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,700
I followed you.

577
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,600
I said we'd speak on the phone.

578
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,900
You can't drive me crazy like that
and then run off.

579
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,600
Drive you crazy?

580
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,600
Let's go somewhere
where we can talk in private.

581
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,800
Did you read the letter?

582
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,200
I don't want any letters.
I want us to talk!

583
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,000
I advise you to leave now.

584
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,500
Never hound the woman
you claim to love.

585
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,000
You should know that,
even at your age.

586
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,500
If you value my affection, go.

587
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,700
I'll call you tomorrow
to fix a date. Okay?

588
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,200
- Take your hat off.
- What?

589
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,000
Good evening.

590
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,900
I have matters to discuss
with Mr. Klemmer.

591
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,700
What's that supposed to mean?

592
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,900
We won't bother you.
We'll talk in my room.

593
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,500
Come on.

594
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,600
Excuse me.

595
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,600
If you try to come in,
you'll be sorry.

596
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,600
There's no food in.
I didn't expect visitors.

597
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,400
Don't put yourself out,
I've already eaten.

598
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,500
First, read the letter.

599
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,200
You've still got it?

600
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,700
So, read it now, please.

601
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,000
Do you want to finish me off?

602
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,100
I said
I don't want to read any letters.

603
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,500
I'm here, you're here.

604
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,200
We're made of flesh and blood.

605
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,800
Don't be so scared.

606
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,000
I'm not. I want all you want.
But read it first.

607
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,900
Is that why we barricaded the door?

608
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,600
Perhaps.

609
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,400
Please!

610
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,300
I don't know how much longer
I want to play this game.

611
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:11,900
Heavy.

612
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,600
Sit down there, please.

613
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,900
"On the contrary, if I beg,
tighten my bonds, please.

614
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,300
"Adjust the belt
by at least 2 or 3 holes.

615
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,900
"The tighter the better.

616
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,900
"Then, gag me with some
stockings I will have ready.

617
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,900
"Stuff them in so hard
that I'm incapable...

618
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,100
"of making any sound.

619
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,900
"Next, take off the blindfold,
please,

620
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,000
"and sit down on my face

621
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,200
"and punch me in the stomach

622
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,600
"to force me
to thrust my tongue in your behind."

623
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,400
Is this supposed to be serious?

624
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,900
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

625
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,200
You want a slap?

626
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,400
"For that is my dearest wish.

627
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,600
"Hands and feet tied behind my back

628
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,100
"and locked up next door
to my mother

629
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,200
"but out of her reach
behind my bedroom door,

630
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,900
"till the next morning.

631
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,700
"Don't worry about my mother,
she's my problem.

632
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,400
"Take all the door keys
with you from the apartment.

633
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,600
"Don't leave a single one here."

634
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,400
What will all this open up for me?

635
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,400
Maybe you'd open your cultured
mouth and comment on this shit.

636
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:10,300
"If you catch me
disobeying any of your orders,

637
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:13,000
"hit me, please,

638
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,100
"even with the back of your hand
on my face.

639
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,800
"Ask me why I don't cry out
to mother

640
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,800
"or why I don't fight back.

641
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,300
"Above all, say things like that,

642
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,600
"so that I realise
just how powerless I am."

643
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,600
What's going on in there?

644
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,200
Open up! Move that chest.

645
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,200
Don't you want to let her in?

646
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,600
Do you want me
to hit you in front of her?

647
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:43,800
Calm down!
Be quiet and watch the TV!

648
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,800
Open up or you'll be sorry.

649
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,100
Stop making a fuss!

650
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:48,500
Incredible!

651
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,900
Do you have no sense of decency?

652
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,300
Invading people's homes like this.

653
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,600
The sheer nerve of it!

654
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,100
Are you angry with me?

655
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,700
I hope you're not.

656
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,300
It's not very well written, I know.

657
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,400
I'm a pianist, not a poet.

658
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,800
After all,
love is built on banal things.

659
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,400
Think it over.
You have my phone number.

660
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,200
Like I said,
I want everything you want.

661
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,800
I have all we need.

662
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:02,000
But it can wait till tomorrow.

663
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,000
Aren't you talking to me?

664
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,400
Do I disgust you?

665
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,600
That's not necessary.

666
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:28,700
The urge to be beaten
has been in me for years.

667
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,400
I waited for you, you know?

668
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,200
It's not a joke, all I wrote.
You know that.

669
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,300
From now on, you give the orders.

670
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,100
From now on,
you choose what I am to wear.

671
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:59,100
What colour do you prefer?
You never said.

672
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:06,100
You're not talking to me?
You're angry?

673
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,200
Say something then.

674
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,900
You're sick.

675
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,600
You need treatment.

676
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,500
If you want to hit me, hit me.

677
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,800
I don't want to soil my hands.

678
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,500
No one would touch your sort,
even with gloves on.

679
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,400
I swear I loved you.

680
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,300
You don't even know what it is.

681
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,300
Right now, you repulse me.

682
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,000
Fuck it.

683
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,700
...came to North America
with the Spanish.

684
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,700
Left to roam free,
they became the famous Mustang.

685
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:35,400
Today's cowboys'most loyal
companion is the quarterhorse.

686
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:39,200
Very fast overshort distances
and with good stamina...

687
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,800
You really are quite shameless.

688
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,700
What have you done with him?

689
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,700
Is he still in your room?

690
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,600
It wouldn't surprise me.

691
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:37,800
Nothing surprises me any more.

692
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,200
But you can do what you want.

693
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,700
At your age.

694
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,000
Good Lord.

695
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,100
All those sacrifices for this.

696
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,800
That's what you get in reward.

697
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,100
You carry on like that.

698
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,500
You can set up a bordello here.

699
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,400
Who cares
what the neighbours think!

700
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,200
As always, you do as you like!

701
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,900
I love you.

702
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:35,100
Stop that! Have you gone insane?

703
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,400
Don't be so filthy,
you're out of your mind!

704
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,200
Shut up. I love you.

705
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,100
I love you, too.

706
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,500
But stop this now.

707
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,700
You're mad!

708
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,800
You're mad.

709
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,700
You're completely mad.

710
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,700
Go to sleep now.

711
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:04,600
You're going to need
all your energy.

712
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:11,300
Even if you're just standing in,
you must be well prepared.

713
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,400
You never know
who might be in the audience.

714
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:48,400
I saw the hairs on your sex.

715
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,000
Can I have a word?

716
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,100
Someone to see you.

717
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,500
Is that your little sister?

718
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,300
Don't run away, he's coming.

719
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,900
- What do you want?
- Speak to you.

720
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,300
I'm listening.

721
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,200
Not here, I can't.

722
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,100
Over there.

723
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,300
How did you manage to find me?

724
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,500
Just there.

725
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,700
Go on in.

726
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,900
Forgive me for the letter.

727
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,000
I'm an idiot. I shouldn't have
done that to you out of the blue.

728
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:11,700
Like you said,
we should have talked first.

729
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:23,500
Forgive me.

730
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,500
What are you doing?

731
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,900
Stop it. Get up now.

732
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:33,400
Come on.

733
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,700
Come on top of me.

734
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,200
- You want me, don't you?
- You're mad.

735
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,200
Come on. I love you.

736
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,100
I'll never write anything
you don't want.

737
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,100
You tell me what you want, okay?

738
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,800
Someone might come in.
You're being ridiculous.

739
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,500
Get up.

740
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:06,200
Hang on, let me do it.

741
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,000
Let me do it, I said.

742
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,100
I can't, not here.

743
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,500
Stop it. I can't.

744
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,300
- It doesn't matter.
- I can't do it here.

745
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:45,100
I know you want to protect us,

746
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:48,500
but I don't care if people catch us.
I don't care.

747
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,100
I love you.

748
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,400
I love you, too.

749
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:25,700
Come on.

750
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:39,400
You have to help me.

751
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,500
- I don't believe it.
- I'm sorry.

752
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:18,900
Don't look.

753
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,200
Don't look.

754
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,200
I must really disgust you.

755
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,800
- No woman ever puked it back.
- Sorry.

756
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,200
I don't know what happened.

757
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,400
I'm clean.

758
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,800
I'm all clean.

759
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:04,400
Like a baby.

760
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:07,900
Inside as well as outside.

761
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,300
For you and thanks to you, darling.

762
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,700
Do you like me calling you darling?

763
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,900
It's absolutely marvellous.

764
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,900
You must be patient.

765
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,900
I'll give you all the names,
we'll play all the games you want.

766
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:25,000
You know you really stink?

767
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,700
Sorry, you stink so much,
no one will ever come close to you.

768
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,700
You'd better leave town
until you don't stink so bad.

769
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:37,900
Rinse your mouth more often,

770
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:40,300
not just when my cock
makes you puke.

771
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,600
Who is it?

772
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:27,600
Open up.

773
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,400
- Open up now!
- What do you want?

774
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,200
I said, open the door!

775
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,200
Quiet!
You'll wake the whole building.

776
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:40,600
I'm opening it.

777
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,000
Don't do that again, okay?

778
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,600
- What do you mean?
- Shut up, you sad cow!

779
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:53,600
Just then,

780
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,600
I was under your window

781
01:46:57,700 --> 01:47:00,800
and I was jerking off.
That's what you want, huh?

782
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,700
You want to...
Is that it?

783
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,600
You're a witch, a pervert!

784
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:13,000
You want to give everyone
your illness, don't you?

785
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,600
- Not me!
- I did apologise.

786
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,700
Fuck your stupid apologies!

787
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,200
Wasn't last night enough for you?

788
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:22,700
Will you make this a habit?
Screaming the house down.

789
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:24,600
Go back to bed!

790
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,800
Walter, please.

791
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,000
- Get out!
- Be off with you! Now!

792
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:30,700
Not as you imagined?

793
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:31,900
We'll see about this.

794
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,500
The police will put a stop to this.

795
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,400
This is nothing to do with you.

796
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,200
Forget your mother.

797
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,100
We have time. We have all night.

798
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,300
Let's pick up where we left off.

799
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:58,300
Is this really
what you had imagined?

800
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,300
What then?

801
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:03,000
You'll be sorry.

802
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,300
Just because we're women doesn't
mean you'll get away with it.

803
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:07,400
Let me go.

804
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,400
This is unbelievable!

805
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,200
At least this one has a key.

806
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,400
Open up!

807
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,100
How about one
for your daughter's room?

808
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,600
That's that dealt with.

809
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
"As for my mother,
pay no attention to her." Yes?

810
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,600
Am I quoting you exactly?

811
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,100
"Give me lots of slaps, darling.

812
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,700
"Hit me hard..." No.

813
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,300
"Hit me around the face
and hit me hard."

814
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,800
At your service, dear lady.

815
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:09,400
Is that what you want?

816
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,500
Stop, please.

817
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,000
What then?

818
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:16,900
Not that. Stop, I beg you.

819
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,800
What are you doing?

820
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,100
- Shut it or I kill her!
- Murderer!

821
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,800
Stop.

822
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,700
- Where's the water?
- In the kitchen.

823
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,100
Don't think you'll get me going...

824
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,800
by flashing your pathetic body.

825
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,400
You know,

826
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:08,200
I do realise
that all this isn't very nice of me.

827
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,700
But if you're honest, you'll admit
you're partly responsible.

828
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,800
I mean, it's true...

829
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:21,100
Yes or no?

830
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:22,000
Yes.

831
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:24,100
Am I right?

832
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,900
Yes, Walter.

833
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:36,500
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

834
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:40,400
You can't get a guy going,
then take refuge on the ice.

835
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:00,000
Not my face! Not my hands!

836
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:02,900
Murderer!

837
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,700
Aren't you ashamed?

838
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,400
I'm begging you to stop.

839
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,500
Don't touch my daughter.

840
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,000
Leave my daughter alone.

841
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,200
I'm begging you.

842
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:23,400
Why do you do that?

843
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:26,900
I calm down
and you try to cross me.

844
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:31,400
Be a little cooperative, fuck it.

845
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:37,400
I'd be happy to learn to play.

846
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:41,300
But not if we only ever play
by your rules.

847
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:47,000
You can't delve around
inside people, then reject them.

848
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:02,100
Be nice to me, please.

849
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:09,600
You can't let me go just like that.

850
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,900
Stop, please.

851
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,500
You have to give a bit.

852
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,900
You can't leave me all alone now.

853
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:16,600
Love me, please.

854
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:46,200
Are you trying to tell me
I should go?

855
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,800
I'd appreciate it
if you tell no one.

856
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,500
Anyhow, it's for your own good.

857
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,900
You can't humiliate
a man that way and...

858
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,300
It's not possible.

859
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:20,700
Will you be alright?

860
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,800
Do you need anything?

861
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,600
Okay?

862
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:34,000
You know, love isn't everything.

863
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,900
See you, then.

864
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,200
Has he gone?

865
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,400
Say something. Has he gone?

866
01:56:58,100 --> 01:56:59,300
Open the door.

867
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,300
What's wrong?

868
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:05,400
Talk to me, for God's sake.

869
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,400
Oh my God, child!

870
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:42,300
What a state you're in!

871
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:45,200
What did the bastard do to you?

872
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,300
Hurry, we'll miss the tram.

873
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I'm just having a glass of water.

874
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:02,900
Don't be so nervous.

875
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:05,100
It's only to replace someone.

876
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:44,400
I'm so looking forward
to your Schubert.

877
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:48,500
I think I should go and take
my seat. It begins in 8 minutes.

878
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:50,300
I'll come up with you.

879
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,500
Good evening,
I'm delighted to see you here.

880
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:58,300
What about our convalescent?
She doesn't lack courage.

881
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,000
She insisted on coming tonight.
To hear you play.

882
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:05,900
How are you feeling?

883
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,100
Sorry, let me introduce myself.

884
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:11,600
I'm Mrs. Schober.
My daughter, Anna.

885
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:14,400
This is my mother.

886
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:18,100
Lovely to meet you. You must be
very proud of your daughter.

887
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,400
Why? It's a school concert.

888
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,400
She's standing in for a pupil.

889
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:25,500
That pupil is my daughter.

890
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:26,800
Where are you sitting?

891
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:33,900
Not far from us.

892
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:37,500
It's late. We'd better go.
Can we go up together?

893
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:39,100
Are you coming, Anna?

894
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:43,700
See you later. I'll go up
with Mrs. Schober. Break a leg.

895
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,400
Enjoy the concert.

896
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:49,300
Goodbye,
it was a pleasure to see you.

897
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:09,400
There, now...

898
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,100
What a nice surprise!

899
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:14,700
George! Look who's here.

900
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:16,500
- Professor Kohut.
- My respects.

901
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:19,300
Hurry up, Gerda.
Give me your coat.

902
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:21,300
I'll keep it with me.

903
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:24,200
Men! Always rushing you.
You know how it is.

904
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:26,700
Have an excellent evening.

905
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:27,800
Come on!

906
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:29,600
See you later, I hope.

907
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:33,000
My respects, Professor.
I can't wait to hear you play.
