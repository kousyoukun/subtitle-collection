1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Nothing to be ashamed of.
There's full transparency.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,797
There's nothing about the Patriot Act
I am ashamed of...

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,737
...in any way, shape or form.

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,900
I have a 1-800 number. Call me.

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,039
I'm the guy you call
if there's a violation or an abuse.

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,016
If you've got a poster child on this,
I wanna see it.

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,644
I'm hired by the people to provide
oversight. I provide oversight.

8
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,690
Trent Lott said,
the day the bill was introduced:

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,091
"Maybe now we can do things
we've wanted to do the last 10 years."

10
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:35,161
No, a dictatorship would be a heck
of a lot easier, no question about it.

11
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:39,328
I mean, they had all this on the shelf
somewhere.

12
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:43,875
Ideas of things they would like to do.
And they got 9/11...

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,535
...and they said, "It's our chance.
Go for it."

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,874
There was an assumption
of the administration...

15
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,078
...that there had to be a surrender
of certain of our rights.

16
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,156
There's troubling definitions
in the bill.

17
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:05,064
The definition of terrorist,
it's so expansive...

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:09,191
...that it could include people who...
- Like me.

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,860
No one read it.
That's the whole point.

20
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:16,772
They wait till the middle of the night,
drop it in the night, print it in the night.

21
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,434
And the next morning when we
come in, it passes.

22
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:25,050
How could Congress pass this
Patriot Act without even reading it?

23
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,482
Sit down, my son.

24
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:32,114
We don't read most of the bills.

25
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,388
Do you really know what that
would entail...

26
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,999
...if we were to read every bill
that we passed?

27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,938
Well, the good thing, it would
slow down the legislative process.

28
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,167
I couldn't believe that virtually
no member of Congress...

29
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,073
...had read the Patriot Act
before voting on it.

30
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,511
So I decided the only patriotic thing
to do...

31
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:00,449
...was for me to read it to them.

32
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,314
Members of Congress,
this is Michael Moore...

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,288
...I would like to read you
the U.S.A. Patriot Act.

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,688
"Section 1:

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,228
Section 210 of this code
reads as follows..."

36
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,298
"Section 2703C..."

37
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:13,600
My job is to secure the homeland.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,058
My job is to secure the homeland.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

39
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,035
But I'm here to take
somebody's order.

40
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,472
That's you, stretch.
What would you like?

41
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,042
- Right behind you.
- I'm gonna order some ribs.

42
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,476
We all know you can't
secure the homeland...

43
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,639
...on an empty stomach.
And in order to remain secure...

44
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,251
...everyone needs to sacrifice.

45
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,281
Especially little Patrick Hamilton.

46
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:43,259
I'm sure each of us has our own
airport-security horror story.

47
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,961
But here's my favorite.

48
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:50,661
The terrorist threat that was posed
by his mommy's breast milk.

49
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,568
I thought if I put a little bit on my lips,
that would be sufficient...

50
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,972
...because I'm tasting it.
She looked at me, and I felt like...

51
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,876
...she was telling me, "Chug that."
She goes, "You need to drink more."

52
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,312
And of a 4-ounce bottle,
I wound up drinking...

53
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,281
...2 more ounces of breast milk...

54
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,388
...that then, because it's touched
my lips, has to be tossed.

55
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,587
While homeland security
was making sure breast milk...

56
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,351
...was kept off our planes...

57
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,893
...they were also doing everything
possible to ensure no one...

58
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,032
...could light a firebomb onboard.

59
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,296
- I can bring that on the plane?
- Actually, yes, you're fine.

60
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,497
One too many books of matches.

61
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,198
You can have four books
and two lighters.

62
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,139
When we already have
the shoe-bomber...

63
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,178
...who would have blown up
an airplane...

64
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,010
...if he had a butane lighter,
according to the FBI...

65
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,745
...why would Transportation Security
say it's okay...

66
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,321
...to take four books of matches
and two lighters...

67
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,459
...as you board a plane? I'm guessing
somebody put pressure on...

68
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,929
...to say, "When an airplane lands,
people wanna light up...

69
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,894
...so don't take their lighters away."

70
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,057
Let me see if I got this straight.

71
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,069
Old guys in the gym, bad.
Peace groups in Fresno, bad.

72
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,501
Breast milk, really bad.

73
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,734
Matches and lighters on the plane?
Hey, no problem.

74
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,075
Was this really about our safety?
Or was something else going on?

75
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:15,147
This is where the Pacific Ocean
meets the shores of Oregon.

76
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:20,555
Over 100 miles of beautiful,
open coastline on our border.

77
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:24,163
And, thanks to the budget
cutbacks...

78
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,858
...the total number of state police
protecting it:

79
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,701
One.

80
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,666
Part-time.

81
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,198
Meet Trooper Brooks.

82
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,674
I maybe get a chance to hit
this stretch of highway...

83
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:43,546
...once, maybe twice a week
during my shifts.

84
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:47,084
You know, just to even drive up here
and look.

85
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:51,350
You know, I mean, as far as I know,
there's lots of things they could do.

86
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,960
I don't even wanna suspect,
because it just makes me ill inside.

87
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,026
Back at the state trooper patrol office,
thanks to the budget cuts...

88
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,497
...Trooper Kenyon had to come in
on his day off...

89
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,568
...to catch up on some paperwork.

90
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,797
For the most part, especially during
summer, when people show up...

91
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,066
...this is what they get.
They close the door.

92
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,676
They can read the sign
about the office closure.

93
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,303
It just basically explains
that due to our cutbacks...

94
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,451
...our office is not open
for administrative business.

95
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,110
There's a sign that explains
when the office is closed...

96
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:27,283
...they can use the phone booth
to get in touch with our dispatch.

97
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,387
Ironically enough, that phone
is a piece of junk.

98
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,963
It doesn't work very well,
so half the time...

99
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,261
...they pick up the phone
and dispatch gets static.

100
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,801
They don't hear anything.

101
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,365
For Tuesday, there'll be
no troop on patrol.

102
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,509
Wednesday, there'll be no troop
on patrol.

103
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,736
Thursday, there'll be
no troop on patrol.

104
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,504
You get calls all the time.

105
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,706
People will call in
a suspicious vehicle...

106
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,044
...or somebody looking suspicious.

107
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,051
And I don't hardly ever respond
to that anymore.

108
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,882
I just don't have the time to do it.

109
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,525
I asked, "How many people do
we have in Oregon...

110
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,160
...on duty tonight?"

111
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,523
And we had eight troopers...

112
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,632
...on for the entire state of Oregon,
working.

113
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:12,999
I think Oregon is a prime example
that homeland security...

114
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:17,109
...is not as secure as what people
would like to believe.

115
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,906
Nobody's sent me a manual that says,
"Here's how you catch a terrorist."

116
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:25,450
If I had that manual, I'd read it.
But I don't. So...

117
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,449
Yeah.

118
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,820
The Bush administration
didn't hand out a manual...

119
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,151
...on how to deal
with the terrorist threat...

120
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:37,057
...because the terrorist threat
wasn't what this was all about.

121
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,163
They just wanted us
to be fearful enough...

122
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,326
...so that we'd get behind
what their real plan was.

123
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,270
Four minutes.

124
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,240
- Right from the top.
- All right.

125
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,205
- How much time?
- Three minutes.

126
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,548
- Okay, folks.
- Thirty seconds.

127
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,484
- Stand by.
- Fifteen seconds.

128
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:13,856
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

129
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:18,197
...four, three, two, one.

130
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,770
My fellow citizens...

131
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,832
At this hour, American
and coalition forces...

132
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,773
...are in the early stages
of military operations...

133
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,207
...to disarm Iraq...

134
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,077
...to free its people and to defend
the world from grave danger.

135
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,481
On my orders, coalition forces
have begun striking...

136
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,179
...selected targets
of military importance...

137
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,985
...to undermine Saddam Hussein's
ability to wage war.

138
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,408
On March 19th, 2003...

139
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,885
...George W. Bush
and the United States military...

140
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,490
...invaded the sovereign nation
of Iraq.

141
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,993
A nation that had never attacked
the United States.

142
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,929
A nation that had never threatened
to attack the United States.

143
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:02,336
A nation that had never murdered
a single American citizen.

144
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:26,791
We're going to find this...
I think this piece of my neighbor.

145
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,696
Young girl, age 20.

146
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,707
I think it's the other part
of her body. That's all.

147
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,010
There is a lot of innocent civilians
that were killed.

148
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,740
There is a lot of innocent civilians
that were killed.

149
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,872
And I think that is because
the U.S. Army...

150
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,046
...we came in, and we knew
it wasn't gonna be easy.

151
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,711
And pretty much at first
shot anything that moved.

152
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,754
When war happens
and fighting starts...

153
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,553
...it's like we're pumped up,
motivated, ready to go.

154
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,989
It's the ultimate rush.

155
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,596
Because you know
you're going into the fight...

156
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,290
...then you got a good song
playing in the background.

157
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:05,767
And that gets you real fired up.
Ready to do the job.

158
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,668
You can hook your CD player up...

159
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
...to the tank's internal
communications system.

160
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,311
When you put your helmet on
you can hear it through the helmet.

161
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,106
This one we listen to the most.

162
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,114
This is the one... When we travel,
we kill the enemy...

163
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,752
Drowning Pool.
"Let the bodies hit the floor"...

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,478
...is fitting for the job.

165
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,390
We picked "the roof is on fire"...

166
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,657
...because it symbolized
Baghdad being on fire.

167
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,325
At the time we wanted it to burn
to get Saddam and his regime out.

168
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:41,599
The roof, the roof
The roof is on fire

169
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,771
We don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn

170
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,937
Burn, motherfucker, burn

171
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:04,286
This is a totally different picture here
being pushed into the city.

172
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,489
Urban warfare in a tank.

173
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,792
Civilians.

174
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,566
The civilians...

175
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,501
You don't know who's friendly,
who's the enemy.

176
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,074
This is a lot more real and true
than just a video game.

177
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,701
People thought it was gonna be, "Look
through the sight and shoot." No.

178
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,472
A lot of this is face to face.

179
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,141
Especially riding by after
some of the bombs went off...

180
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,379
...and seeing all the people
on the side of the road bloated up.

181
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,855
And all the smells around you
from the people lying dead, rotted.

182
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,518
It's a lot more gruesome
than you think.

183
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,029
We called in with some artillery
and some napalm and things.

184
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,167
Some innocent women
and children got hit.

185
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,269
We met them on the road,
and they had...

186
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,837
...little girls with noses
blown off. And...

187
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,337
And...

188
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,443
...husbands carrying their dead wives
and things like that.

189
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,512
That was extremely difficult
to deal with. You're like:

190
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,548
"Shoot. What the hell
do we do now?"

191
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:02,451
The targeting capabilities
and the care that goes into targeting...

192
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:08,856
...is as impressive as anything
anyone could see.

193
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,763
- Got him.
- Good. Second one.

194
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,661
Get the other one.

195
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,567
The care that goes into it,
the humanity that goes into it.

196
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,426
Honestly, I think we should
just trust our president...

197
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,264
...in every decision he makes,
and we should support that.

198
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,703
You know? And be faithful
in what happens.

199
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,673
- Do you trust this president?
- Yes, I do.

200
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,373
Britney Spears was not alone.

201
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,277
The majority
of the American people...

202
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,886
...trusted the president.
And why shouldn't they?

203
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,783
He'd spent the better part
of the last year...

204
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,517
...giving them every reason
why we should invade Iraq.

205
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,856
Saddam Hussein has gone
to elaborate lengths...

206
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,691
...spent enormous sums...

207
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:57,393
...taken great risks to build and keep
weapons of mass destruction.

208
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,631
Saddam Hussein is determined
to get his hands on a nuclear bomb.

209
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,174
Nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapon.
Nuclear weapon.

210
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:09,042
Active chemical munitions bunkers.
Mobile production facilities.

211
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,080
We know he's got
chemical weapons.

212
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,241
He's got them. He's got them.
He's got them.

213
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,387
Huh, that's weird.

214
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:19,184
Because that's not what Bush's
people said when he first took office.

215
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,351
He hasn't developed capability...

216
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,655
...with respect to weapons
of mass destruction.

217
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:28,062
He's unable to project conventional
power against his neighbors.

218
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,900
We're able to keep arms from him.
Military forces haven't been rebuilt.

219
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:37,031
Saddam Hussein aids
and protects terrorists...

220
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,371
...including members of al Qaeda.

221
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,537
There was a relationship
between Iraq and al Qaeda.

222
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,047
Saddam. Al Qaeda.
Saddam. Al Qaeda.

223
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,619
Saddam. The al Qaeda. Saddam.
Saddam. Saddam. Al Qaeda.

224
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,188
It's only a matter of time
before terrorist states...

225
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,382
...armed with weapons
of mass destruction...

226
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,086
...develop the capability to deliver
those weapons to U.S. Cities.

227
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,390
We're giving you facts
and conclusions...

228
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,396
...based on solid intelligence.

229
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,728
He's a man who hates America.

230
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,773
This is a man who cannot stand
what we stand for.

231
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,378
There's willingness
to terrorize himself.

232
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,879
He hates the fact, like al Qaeda does,
that we love freedom.

233
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,950
After all, this is a guy that tried
to kill my dad at one time.

234
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,756
They got people to believe there was
a threat when in fact there wasn't one.

235
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,520
You get told things every day
that don't happen.

236
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,322
It doesn't seem to bother people.

237
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,398
The Democrats were there to put
a stop to all these falsehoods.

238
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,338
I'll vote to give the president
authority he needs.

239
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,635
United States is prepared to lead the
coalition of the willing that will do it.

240
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,209
When I say we will lead
a coalition of the willing...

241
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,007
...to disarm him if he chooses
not to disarm, I mean it.

242
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,947
- Who's in that coalition of the willing?
- You will find out who's in it.

243
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,745
The coalition of the willing.

244
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,185
Roll call.

245
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,349
The Republic of Palau.

246
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,793
The Republic of Costa Rica.

247
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,696
The Republic of Iceland.

248
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,805
None of these countries has an army,
or for that matter, weapons.

249
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,966
So it looked like we'd be doing
most of the invading stuff ourselves.

250
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,773
- Then there was also:
- Romania.

251
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:27,648
The Kingdom of Morocco.

252
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,812
Morocco wasn't officially
a member of the coalition...

253
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,221
...but according to one report, they did
offer to send 2000 monkeys...

254
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,486
...to help detonate land mines.

255
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,691
These are men of vision.

256
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,492
The Netherlands.

257
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,464
And I'm proud to call them allies.

258
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,005
Afghanistan.

259
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,004
Afghanistan?

260
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,405
Oh, yeah. They had an army.

261
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:55,570
Our army. I guess that's one way
to build a coalition.

262
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,148
Just keep invading countries.

263
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,583
Yes, with our mighty coalition intact,
we were ready.

264
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,316
One could almost say
it's the mother of all coalitions.

265
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,088
Fortunately, we have an independent
media in this country...

266
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,198
...who would tell us the truth.

267
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,394
The rallying around the president,
the flag and the troops has begun.

268
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,095
And we're gonna win!

269
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,866
You have to be with troops
to understand the adrenaline.

270
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,510
I want you to know,
I think Navy SEALs rock.

271
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,704
The pictures you're seeing
are absolutely phenomenal.

272
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,375
When my country's at war,
I want my country to win.

273
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,079
Iraqi opposition has faded
in the face of American power.

274
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,625
What you're watching here is truly
historic television and journalism.

275
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,284
It was absolutely electrifying.

276
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,795
They had to strap me in with my
camera at the back of the plane.

277
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,366
An awesome, synchronized
killing machine.

278
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,059
There is an inherent bias...

279
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,899
...in the coverage of the American
press in general.

280
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,473
Am I slanted and biased?
You damn well bet I am.

281
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,340
But one story the media
wasn't covering...

282
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,279
...was the personal story...

283
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,818
...of each and every soldier
who was killed in the war.

284
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,456
The government would not allow
any cameras...

285
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,888
...to show the coffins coming home.

286
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,189
That kind of story is a downer...

287
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:21,231
...especially when you're getting
ready for a party on a boat.

288
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:04,970
My fellow Americans...

289
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,981
...major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

290
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,946
In the battle of Iraq...

291
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:16,919
...the United States
and our allies have prevailed.

292
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,791
Get out of the way!

293
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,476
Move! Move! Move! Move!

294
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,335
162, the number of troops
killed by hostile fire.

295
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,199
- 244 U.S. Troops...
- 384 U.S. Troops lost their lives...

296
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,308
- Total killed, 484.
- Died in the line of duty, 500...

297
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,773
631 American troops...

298
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,276
More than 825 troops
have been killed in Iraq.

299
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,244
The largest number of American
military deaths since Vietnam.

300
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:23,480
There are some who feel like
that if they attack us...

301
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,284
...that we may decide
to leave prematurely.

302
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,459
They don't understand,
if that's the case.

303
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,425
Let me finish.

304
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,564
There are some who feel like
the conditions are such...

305
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,532
...that they can attack us there.

306
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,433
My answer is, bring them on.

307
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,216
The United States was planning
on walking through here...

308
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,721
...like it was gonna be easy and all.

309
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:03,089
But it's not that easy
to conquer a country, is it?

310
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,761
The renewed battle for control
of Iraq raged for a fourth day today...

311
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,272
...with street clashes in nearly
every corner of the country.

312
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,071
Iraq could become "another Vietnam."

313
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,647
Officials say they see evidence
that Sunni and Shiite extremists...

314
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,306
...might be joining forces.

315
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,577
They're not happy they're occupied.

316
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,114
I wouldn't be happy
if I were occupied either.

317
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,031
Two Japanese aid workers
and a journalist...

318
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,261
...kidnapped by men calling
themselves...

319
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,302
...the Mujahideen Squadrons.

320
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,634
They threatened to burn
the hostages alive...

321
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:54,040
...if Japan does not withdraw its troops
from Iraq within three days.

322
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,205
What's happened?

323
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,847
They attacked our convoy.

324
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,184
You wanna give us your name?

325
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,315
Hamill, Thomas.

326
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:06,458
The Pentagon might keep up
to 24,000 troops in combat...

327
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,586
The Pentagon might keep up
to 24,000 troops in combat...

328
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,024
...beyond their tour.

329
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,528
I know our numbers
in the military have gone down.

330
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,462
They talk about retention.

331
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,230
I never expected
to be deployed this long.

332
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:20,702
I don't think anybody did.

333
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,906
I don't have any clue
as to why we're still in Iraq.

334
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,477
If Donald Rumsfeld was here,
I'd ask him for his resignation.

335
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,715
With the war not going
as planned...

336
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,083
...and the military in need
of many more troops...

337
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,355
...where would they find
the new recruits?

338
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,514
Military experts say three times...

339
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,922
...the 120,000 U.S. Troops
now deployed...

340
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,996
...would be needed to pacify
and rebuild the country.

341
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,999
They would find them
all across America...

342
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,866
...in the places that had been
destroyed by the economy.

343
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,934
Places where one
of the only jobs available...

344
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,043
...was to join the Army.

345
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,305
Places like my hometown
of Flint, Michigan.

346
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,108
I was watching TV one day...

347
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:08,219
...and they showed some of the areas
that had been hit by bombs.

348
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,480
And while watching,
I got to thinking...

349
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,886
...there's parts of Flint
that look like that.

350
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,548
And we ain't been in a war.

351
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,992
Look at the neighborhood I live in.

352
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,562
Most of them are abandoned.
You know, I mean...

353
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,360
...that's not right.
You wanna talk about terrorism?

354
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,867
Come right here. President Bush,
right here. Come right here.

355
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,438
He knows about this corner.
I e-mailed him.

356
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,708
At the end of January of '04...

357
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,641
...the unemployment rate
in Flint was 17 percent.

358
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,407
But you have to take
into consideration as well...

359
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,552
...that when your unemployment
runs out you're no longer counted.

360
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,882
I would say that we're close
to at least 50 percent...

361
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,854
...not working or underemployed.

362
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,892
Because being underemployed
is just as dangerous.

363
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,862
My family has gone through
the welfare system...

364
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,293
...when it was Job Central.

365
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,594
In the mid-'80s I came through
the job training partnership program.

366
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,070
I went to a secretary school.

367
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:05,836
Years later, I'm executive assistant
to the president of the agency.

368
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,603
Interesting.

369
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,645
My mother used to tell me
all the time:

370
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,942
"Why do you always go
for the underdog?"

371
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,347
It was because the underdog
is who needed me.

372
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,047
People that don't have anything,
that's who I have to fight for.

373
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,418
And that's who I have fought for
my entire life.

374
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,493
I started taking my children
and telling my children:

375
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,186
"The military is a good option.

376
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:28,299
I can't afford to have you
go to college. I can't pay your way.

377
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,059
Financial aid will not help you."

378
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,669
So I, as a mother,
started teaching my children...

379
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,033
...about the options
that the military could do.

380
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,970
They would take them
around the world.

381
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,339
They'd see all the things that I,
as a mother, couldn't let them see.

382
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:44,471
It'd pay for their education that I, as
their mother and father, couldn't pay.

383
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,141
The military is a good option
for kids in Flint.

384
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,345
The military is an excellent option
for the people of Flint.

385
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:55,519
How many of you have a friend
or a family member in the service?

386
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,655
Anybody currently serving
overseas?

387
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,629
- A brother of mine.
- My cousin.

388
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,062
Yeah, cousin.

389
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,100
- Where's your brother?
- Iraq.

390
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,101
Germany.

391
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:11,368
My cousin got shipped off
to Iraq, like, three days ago.

392
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,976
Dang.

393
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,375
There's, like, an Army
or Navy recruiter...

394
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,914
...or Marines recruiter up there
almost every week...

395
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,679
...in the lunchroom recruiting
students at the lunchroom.

396
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,589
There are people with a calling.

397
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:35,163
Most serve one weekend a month
and two weeks a year.

398
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,930
Earning money for college.

399
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,106
Protecting their community.

400
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,844
In the Army National Guard...

401
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,610
...you can.

402
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,950
I'm going into the Air Force.

403
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,146
I'm gonna take a year off
after high school.

404
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,759
And then make a career. I wanna be
an aircraft maintenance technician.

405
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,987
I ran into a recruiter, and there
was something I noticed about it.

406
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,859
And this is kind of on another...
I noticed it was odd.

407
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,729
More like he was hiring me
than recruiting me for the Army.

408
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,031
It was the way he approached me.
I was in Borders Books and Music.

409
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,470
He came up like he was handing
us a business card.

410
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,133
He had business cards
made for the Army.

411
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,076
Meet Marine Staff
Sergeant Dale Kortman...

412
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,277
...and Sergeant Raymond Plouhar.

413
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:34,450
They are two of the many recruiters
assigned to Flint, Michigan.

414
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,852
They're very busy these days.

415
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,020
Look, he's running away already.

416
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,859
- He's seen us coming.
- Yeah.

417
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,293
What have we got here?

418
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,733
- Need a little gangster.
- Yeah.

419
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,969
We're heading over
to the Courtland Mall right now.

420
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,976
They decided not to go
to the wealthier...

421
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,477
...Genesee Valley Mall
in the suburbs.

422
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,514
They have a hard time
recruiting young people there.

423
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:02,017
Instead, they went
to the other mall.

424
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,849
- Let's go in through Mervyn's.
- In through Mervyn's.

425
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:08,857
And then we'll walk straight down
and straight back and then go down...

426
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,252
Gents, you know
we're looking at you, right?

427
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,091
You guys ever think
about joining up?

428
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,859
I thought about going to college
and playing basketball.

429
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,434
- You any good?
- Yeah. Especially basketball.

430
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,731
Good. You can play ball
for the Marine Corps.

431
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,739
Travel around the world
for the Corps basketball team.

432
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,343
- David Robinson was in the military.
- Oh, was he?

433
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,274
Yeah, you can definitely hook it up.

434
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,939
Right now somebody out there wants
to be a Marine but has no idea how to.

435
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,312
- Where you work at?
- I work at KFC.

436
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,614
- Sweet. Hook us up with deals.
- Yes.

437
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,552
They're waiting to get recruited.

438
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,886
I was gonna try a career
in music or something.

439
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,325
Career in music? Maybe we can
get you a career in music.

440
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,364
Let the Marines go for it.
I'm sure you know who Shaggy is.

441
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:52,701
- You know anything about him?
- Yeah, he's the Jamaican singer.

442
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,896
How about a former Marine?

443
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,631
- Oh.
- Did you know it?

444
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,504
You need to know discipline
if you're gonna get into music.

445
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,441
Especially discipline
with the money.

446
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,013
If you make a million, you need
to manage that money.

447
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,774
Come to the office, we can talk...

448
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,885
...show you everything
about the Marines.

449
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,351
- A plan?
- What you got going this afternoon?

450
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,252
How about tomorrow?
10:00 Monday morning?

451
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,326
- That sounds pretty good.
- You want me to pick you up?

452
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,055
It's better to get them
when they're in ones and twos...

453
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:20,926
...and work on them that way.

454
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,327
Ladies, ready to join up?

455
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,526
Green hat right behind us.

456
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,366
- Looks young. He's young.
- Yeah.

457
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,770
We got two over here...

458
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,807
...right over by the red van.

459
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,105
You go that way, I go this way,
we corner them.

460
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,271
- You're in the ninth grade?
- Yes, sir.

461
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,247
Man, you look older
than ninth grade.

462
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,114
All right, here's my card.

463
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,255
You ever thought about
being a Marine, man?

464
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,755
I've thought about it.
I've got a wife and kid now.

465
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,586
Even more reason to join up.

466
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,387
What I want to do, man...

467
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,588
...is get information from you
so I can scratch you off my list...

468
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,394
...saying I've talked to you, and
you're not interested. Is that cool?

469
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,969
What's your name? Phone number?
What's your address?

470
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,537
Add another one to the list.

471
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:06,303
However, one would love to have
that chance to experience college life.

472
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,606
You know, stuff young people
can do without having the risk...

473
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,046
...of dying in the process,
I guess I can say candidly.

474
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,654
The holidays add a bit more friction,
as opposed to just another night...

475
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:23,989
...in the fact we wanna give our guys
a little time off, time to relax.

476
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:28,121
However, we are in a combat zone,
and my soldiers do recognize that fact.

477
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,394
Everybody's a little bit
nervous about it, I guess.

478
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,539
We're professionals.
We're gonna take care of you.

479
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,541
I promise.

480
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:42,579
Every house here has the right
to have weapons.

481
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,978
Maximum, one AK-47.

482
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,017
We always expect the targets
to be armed.

483
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,585
Rock 'n' roll.

484
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,365
These are fucking bolt cutters.

485
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,831
This goddamn thing
to pry doors open.

486
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,936
Pop this in there...

487
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,541
Hey, Adele, just hold up.

488
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,775
No, no, no, no.

489
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,612
Where's she going?

490
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,116
- I'll go with her.
- Where's she going?

491
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,551
She's gonna call him.

492
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:02,591
She's gonna call him? No, no, no.
Where is he at right now?

493
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,592
Not on the phone.
Not on the phone.

494
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,823
Is he in the house?
Is he in the house?

495
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,331
- Passerelli! Passerelli!
- Is he in the house?

496
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,732
He is? He is in the house? Where?

497
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,065
- This is him?
- Get up there, second floor!

498
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,232
Watch out. Go, go, go!
Watch out, Adele, watch out.

499
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,173
I have one coming up.

500
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:25,275
That's Suheib Al Douri?

501
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,047
- What's your name?
- Suheib.

502
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,620
- This is Suheib. Yeah.
- This is Suheib.

503
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,654
- This is Suheib?
- Yeah.

504
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,482
Stand him up. Get up.

505
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:44,527
Tell them to calm down, please.
We will not be long.

506
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,706
We appreciate your cooperation.
This is the target.

507
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,401
Suheib Al Douri. Bring him out.

508
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,944
We have to, as you go back
to the old saying...

509
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,776
...win the hearts and minds
of the people. That's our job.

510
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,113
We have to... We have to bring the...

511
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,586
The ideal of democracy
and freedom to the country...

512
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,488
...and show them that the American
people are not here to rule Iraq.

513
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:31,945
I start doing evidence turn-in.
That process takes about three hours.

514
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,914
So that's gonna be it for the night.

515
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,179
That concludes Christmas Eve.

516
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,423
Merry Christmas, PRT.
Merry Christmas.

517
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,721
Santa came to Iraq
just for you guys.

518
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,830
Trying to keep skies
clear for you, Santa.

519
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,392
Do you consider yourself
a proud American?

520
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,831
Absolutely.

521
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,371
I'm an extremely proud American.
I'm probably more proud...

522
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,803
...than the average Joe.

523
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,503
When I put my flag out,
I can't allow it to touch the ground.

524
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,138
Because I know the lives that were lost
and the blood that was shed...

525
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,285
...so that I could be here
and have a flag.

526
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,853
- How often do you put the flag out?
- Every single day. Every day.

527
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,014
I started when my daughter
was in Desert Storm.

528
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,716
I had the same flag...

529
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:19,330
...flying on my front porch
and the same yellow ribbons.

530
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,523
Praying and hoping every day
that my child would come home safe.

531
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,726
And everybody's child
would come home safe.

532
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:26,564
- And she did.
- And she did.

533
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,968
Have other family members
been in the military?

534
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,732
Absolutely. Uncles, aunts...

535
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,004
...cousins, brothers, father.

536
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,147
- Very strong military family.
- Very strong.

537
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,545
My family was...
My family is what I consider...

538
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,515
...part of the backbone of America.

539
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,177
It's families like mine.
And it's not just my family.

540
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,916
There's hundreds of families,
millions of families...

541
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,492
...that this country was founded
on their backs.

542
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:53,119
I have been known to be
a conservative Democrat. Yeah.

543
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,357
That's what you consider
yourself? Yeah.

544
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,866
- Yeah, it's a great country.
- It's a great country. A great country.

545
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:03,838
The cross that I choose to wear
is a multicultural, multicolor cross.

546
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:07,206
That's because I believe that all
God's people come in many colors.

547
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,779
And my family itself is multicultural.

548
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,682
You have a daughter
who went into the military.

549
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:16,082
Then your first-born son,
in the military.

550
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:21,715
That's quite a gift to the country
from your family.

551
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,361
So having a son in the Army,
pretty proud thing.

552
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,760
Oh, you know what? He made it.

553
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:32,930
What was your reaction to protestors
during the Gulf War or Vietnam?

554
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,867
I always hated the protestors.

555
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,136
I always hated the protestors.
It was just a slap in my face.

556
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,303
It was just like they were
dishonoring my son.

557
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:47,212
And I burned in my soul
to tell them, "You don't understand.

558
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,546
They're not there because
they wanna be there."

559
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:53,282
But then I came to understand
they weren't protesting the men...

560
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:57,394
...and women there. They were
protesting the concept of the war.

561
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,531
I know I'm a soldier,
and I'm here to do a job.

562
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,027
I've been a soldier for a while.

563
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,372
Once you have to go
and do your job...

564
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,906
...and you see the things
that you see...

565
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,675
...I was saying, there's some
disillusionment in that.

566
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:20,284
Battalion commander fully
expects us to be...

567
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,285
...attacked in some type of way...

568
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,548
...before we get to FARP Shell.

569
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,393
I know that so far
it's been pretty calm.

570
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,926
Not much has happened.

571
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:35,931
But be aware that it can,
and it probably will.

572
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,373
They're beginning to organize
themselves, just in neighborhoods.

573
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,908
The kids get together a lot.
Well, I can't say kids...

574
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,602
...but guys about 17, 18...

575
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,338
...starting to come together.

576
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,949
They hate us.
Why, I'm not really sure.

577
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:59,714
Immoral behavior
breeds immoral behavior.

578
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,824
When a president commits
the immoral act...

579
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:07,328
...of sending otherwise good kids
to war based on a lie...

580
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,330
...this is what you get.

581
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,992
Hey, is he ticklish?

582
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,001
Don't tell me you don't know.

583
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,353
To have these people
shoot at us, kill us, blow us up...

584
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,554
...whatever, means they can.

585
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,358
And I don't understand it.

586
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,127
We're trying to help these people,
and it seems...

587
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,463
...they don't want our help.
"Get out of here!"

588
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,402
The minute something goes wrong,
"Why weren't you here?

589
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,633
Why didn't you do this?"
You know, it's...

590
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,834
I hate this country.

591
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:58,073
You know, you... I feel
that a part of your soul...

592
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,410
...is destroyed in taking another life.

593
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,620
Yeah, that statement is very true.

594
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,284
You cannot kill someone
without killing a part of yourself.

595
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,991
If you get called up...

596
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,995
...will you go back to Iraq?
- No.

597
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:20,229
What repercussions
do you face if you don't?

598
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,929
Possible jail time.

599
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,573
That's one possible thing.

600
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,403
- Are you willing to risk that?
- Yes.

601
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,239
Yes, l...

602
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:32,179
I will not let my person...

603
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,648
I will not let anyone...

604
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,257
...send me back over there
to kill other poor people.

605
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:46,057
Especially when they pose
no threat to me and my country.

606
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,862
I won't do it.

607
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,566
This is an impressive crowd.
The haves...

608
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,072
...and the have-mores.

609
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,344
Some people call you the elite.

610
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,777
I call you my base.

611
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,148
While Bush was busy
taking care of his base...

612
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,521
...and professing his love
for our troops...

613
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,825
...he proposed cutting combat
soldiers' pay by 33 percent...

614
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,764
...and assistance to their families
by 60 percent.

615
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,769
He opposed giving veterans...

616
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,930
...a billion dollars more
in health-care benefits...

617
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:33,168
...and he supported
closing veteran hospitals.

618
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,802
He tried to double the prescription
drug costs for veterans...

619
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,678
...and opposed full benefits
for part-time reservists.

620
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,019
When Staff Sergeant Brett Petriken
from Flint...

621
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,782
...was killed in Iraq on May 26th...

622
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,358
...the Army sent his last paycheck
to his family...

623
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:53,122
...but they docked him for the last five
days of the month he didn't work...

624
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,629
...because he was dead.

625
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,436
They say they're not gonna leave
any veteran behind...

626
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:02,004
...but they're leaving all kinds
of veterans behind.

627
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,171
To say we're forgotten,
I know we're not. But missed? Yes.

628
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,143
Yes. There's a lot of soldiers
that have been missed...

629
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:12,180
...that have been skipped over.

630
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,409
Didn't get the proper coverage
they deserved.

631
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,645
There's a death toll, but not
showing the injured or amputated.

632
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,326
- I still feel like I have hands.
- Yeah.

633
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,726
And the pain is like my hands
are being crushed in a vise.

634
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,696
But they do a lot to help it...

635
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,835
...and they take a lot
of the edge off it.

636
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,870
It makes it a lot more tolerable.

637
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,169
I was injured in late April
on patrol in Baghdad.

638
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,611
A couple of guys come out
and ambushed us.

639
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,216
I got nerve damage
and stuff like that.

640
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,685
I've got a lot of pain.
I'm constantly in pain.

641
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,448
I take a lot of morphine...

642
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,992
...to help with that and stuff.

643
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,194
I'm doing...

644
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,833
Doing... You know, just readjusting.

645
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,492
Getting life back on track.

646
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:09,333
You know what I'm saying?

647
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,567
I'm not gonna do what it is
that I did before.

648
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,775
I was a Republican
for quite a few years.

649
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,540
And...

650
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,345
...for some reason, they...

651
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,614
They conduct business
in a very dishonest way.

652
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,625
I'm gonna be incredibly active
in the Democratic Party...

653
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,821
...down where I live once I get out.

654
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,324
I'm gonna definitely do my best...

655
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,629
...to ensure that the Democrats
win control.

656
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,773
Iraq, Baghdad, I didn't know
anything of those things.

657
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,737
And we were in the hallway
in the upstairs of our house...

658
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,644
...and he was crying and said
that he was really scared.

659
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,183
And he didn't want
to have to go to Iraq.

660
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:59,551
So we had a conversation about,
sometimes some fear is healthy...

661
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,749
...because it keeps
our senses about us.

662
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,258
That's when he told me
he hadn't told anybody else.

663
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,624
But he knew he was going
to Baghdad.

664
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:13,029
We were... As everybody,
we were glued to the TV.

665
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,173
Just glued, completely glued
to the television...

666
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,137
...in hopes of seeing
a glimpse of him.

667
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,573
"Can't you please go to
where the helicopters are?

668
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,770
Can't you please let us see him?"

669
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,643
Then that night,
it was about 10 something...

670
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,342
...I went upstairs to the bedroom.

671
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,113
I was in bed, flipping the channels
with the remote.

672
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:34,725
All I heard was, "Black Hawk down,
South Central Iraq."

673
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,884
What I can tell you at this hour
is that last night...

674
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,225
...the Army did, indeed, lose
a Black Hawk helicopter.

675
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,959
We are being told by officers
on the ground...

676
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,865
...that there were six occupants
inside the Black Hawk.

677
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,165
The next morning
I got up, and I said:

678
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,672
"You push those sad thoughts
out of your mind.

679
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,640
Okay, Jesus,
I need you to come in.

680
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,439
I need you, Jesus.
You gotta help me through this."

681
00:41:56,614 --> 00:42:00,106
The Army called me, and I remember
getting on the phone and him saying...

682
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,219
Asking me was I Lila Lipscomb,
and I said, "Yes."

683
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:06,288
And he said, "Mother of
Sergeant Michael Pedersen?"

684
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,894
And I remember
dropping the telephone.

685
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,661
And all I can honestly say
that I remember...

686
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,496
...is, "Ma'am,
the United States Army...

687
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,766
...the secretary of defense
regretfully informs you..."

688
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,043
That's all I know.

689
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,080
The grief grabbed me so hard...

690
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,719
...that I literally fell on the floor.

691
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,254
And I was alone. I didn't
have anybody to pick me up.

692
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,189
So I literally crawled
over to my desk...

693
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,828
...and was hanging on.

694
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,294
And I remember screaming:

695
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,433
"Why does it have to be Michael?

696
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,038
Why did you have to take my son?
Why is it my son you had to take?

697
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,106
He didn't do anything.

698
00:42:57,275 --> 00:43:00,005
He wasn't a bad guy.
He was a good guy.

699
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,236
Why did you have to take my son?"

700
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:06,183
L... l... l... I'm...

701
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,410
I can't imagine what it must be like
to lose a son or a daughter...

702
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,147
...or a husband and...
Or a wife, for that matter.

703
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,814
And l... It pains me.

704
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,261
Do you have his last letter?

705
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,329
It was mailed March 16th...

706
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,934
...but I didn't get it until probably
a week before he was killed.

707
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,299
"Hello. Hey, Mama.

708
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,702
Well, sorry I haven't
been able to call.

709
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,139
They took the phone
seven days ago.

710
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,302
I got the letter and box.

711
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:39,381
That is so cool.
Your first grandson came...

712
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:43,245
...the same day your oldest son did.

713
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:45,821
How is everyone? I'm doing fine.

714
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:50,120
We are just out here in the sand
and windstorms waiting.

715
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,058
What in the world is wrong
with George?

716
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,131
Trying to be like his dad, Bush.

717
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,064
He got us out here
for nothing whatsoever.

718
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,501
I am so furious right now, Mama.

719
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,371
I really hope they do not
re-elect that fool, honestly.

720
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:11,344
I am in good spirits,
and I am doing okay.

721
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:13,278
I really miss you guys.

722
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:15,419
Thanks for the Bible...

723
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,716
...and books and candy.

724
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:24,020
I really look forward to letters
from you guys.

725
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:28,427
Well, tell all the family hello
and that I am doing fine.

726
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,035
We don't expect anything
to happen any time soon.

727
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:36,401
I cannot wait to get home
and get back to my life.

728
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:38,701
Tell Sputnik congrats...

729
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:42,539
...and I'll see my first nephew soon...

730
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,578
...as soon as I get back
to the States.

731
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,276
Hope you guys are doing okay...

732
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,443
...and keep sending the mail.

733
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,954
It makes getting through
the days easier.

734
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,495
Well, I am on my way to bed...

735
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:03,156
...so I will write you guys soon.

736
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,461
I love and miss...

737
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,763
...all of you guys."

738
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,716
I want him to be alive...

739
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,685
...and I can't make him alive.

740
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,624
But your flesh just aches.

741
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:32,285
You want your child.
It's out of sync.

742
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:36,365
A parent is not supposed
to bury their child.

743
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:43,039
I feel... I feel sad for my family...

744
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,539
...because we lost our son.

745
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,606
But...

746
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,942
...I really feel sorry
for the other families...

747
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:57,179
...that is losing their kids
as we speak.

748
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,288
And for what?

749
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,256
L... I don't...

750
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:07,455
That's the...
I guess the sickening part.

751
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:08,928
For what?

752
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,460
You've heard a lot
about Halliburton lately.

753
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,597
Criticism is okay. We can take it.
Criticism is not failure.

754
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,901
Our employees are doing
a great job.

755
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,136
We're feeding the soldiers.
We're rebuilding Iraq.

756
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,510
Will things go wrong?
Sure they will. It's a war zone.

757
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:28,151
We're serving the troops
because of what we know...

758
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,786
...not who we know.

759
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,014
Let me tell you about Halliburton,
the company I ran.

760
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,456
I'm proud of what I did at Halliburton.

761
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,790
The people are proud of what
they've accomplished. I, frankly...

762
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,932
...don't feel any need to apologize...

763
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,000
...for the way I've spent my time
over the last five years...

764
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,899
...as the CEO and chairman
of a major American corporation.

765
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:50,768
This is also an attempt
to divert attention...

766
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:54,035
...from the fact they have
no energy policy.

767
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,510
And as the secretary of energy said,
"We were caught unawares."

768
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:04,278
In the middle of the war, Microsoft,
DHL and other corporations...

769
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,616
...invited Halliburton
to a conference...

770
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:10,591
...to figure out how much money
could be made in Iraq.

771
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,526
Having worked this...

772
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:19,831
...effort, even since before the...
The invasion...

773
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,666
...the liberation of Iraq started.

774
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,675
You, industry, are definitely
a vital part of that effort.

775
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,905
We appreciate your interest
in this. We need you.

776
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,242
Lots of you are small businesses
and struggling:

777
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,750
"How do we get a piece of this?
You big guys are gonna get it.

778
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:41,414
The rest of us will have subcontracting
capability or none at all."

779
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,856
USTDA is for you.

780
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,791
Once that oil starts flowing...

781
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,022
...and money coming,
gonna be lots of money.

782
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,599
It's the second-largest
reserve of oil in the world.

783
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:52,497
No question of how much
money's there.

784
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,639
I've been getting complaints
from Iraqi firms and American firms.

785
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:00,201
The lack of transparency,
the corruption.

786
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:05,076
I think the profits American companies
are making, the main companies...

787
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,511
...are so overwhelming.

788
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:10,142
I mean, when you have a line item
for a million dollars...

789
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:13,518
...and you subcontract it out
for 50 or 60 or $70,000...

790
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:14,953
...that's a huge profit.

791
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,525
It's the American taxpayer
that's gonna pay for that.

792
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:21,062
And it's gonna get better.
Start building relationships.

793
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,063
Because it's gonna get
much better...

794
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,634
...as the oil flows
and their budgets increase.

795
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:28,636
Good news is, whatever it costs,
the government will pay you.

796
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,639
War is always good
for certain companies...

797
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:34,039
...that are in the war...
The business of war.

798
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,372
We're very proud.

799
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,847
Supporting U.S. Government
and military.

800
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,613
The real heroes of the campaign
and the reconstruction...

801
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:47,154
...are the men and women
of the U.S. Armed Forces.

802
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,884
We're proud of being any part
we can in supporting them.

803
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,087
Halliburton delivers hot meals,
supplies, clean clothing...

804
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,756
...and communications
to our soldiers...

805
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:01,166
...so they can be
a little closer to home.

806
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,973
It's a girl!

807
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:07,133
Halliburton. Proud to serve
our troops.

808
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:10,712
I just read in the paper
Halliburton got another contract.

809
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,782
- Halliburton got another contract.
- That's right.

810
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,545
Which is not being...

811
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,119
...contested at all.

812
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,689
Because nobody knows.

813
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:23,418
Well, it's in the paper,
so somebody knows.

814
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:27,655
But that's after it happens,
after the fact. It's too late.

815
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,762
The United States is now a major
player in the Iraqi oil business.

816
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:35,030
American troops
guard the oil fields...

817
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:38,299
...as Texas oil workers
assess their potential.

818
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,036
It's a safe environment to work in.
We don't feel any risk.

819
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:45,147
We feel we're being well protected
here, or we wouldn't be here.

820
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,578
It's no secret. I mean...

821
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:50,880
...I make anywhere between
2 and 3000 a month.

822
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:53,285
A Halliburton employee
out here driving a bus...

823
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,824
...can make between 8 and 10,000
a month. Explain that one to me.

824
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,484
For 40 hours a week.

825
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,721
Driving the same
two-and-half-mile route.

826
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:02,229
Go figure.

827
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,492
Where's the justification in that?

828
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,603
There's no other single area
of the world today...

829
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,706
...with the opportunity
for business, new business...

830
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,844
...similar to the opportunity
that's available today in Iraq.

831
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,809
The president went in,
did what he did.

832
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,007
We're supporting him
and our troops.

833
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:24,780
We wanna make sure
that the efforts and the lost lives...

834
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,422
...wasn't for no reason.

835
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,024
If it wasn't for the oil,
nobody would be there.

836
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,854
Nobody would worry about it.

837
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,053
Unfortunately,
at least for the near term...

838
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:38,025
...we think it's gonna be a good
situation, a dangerous situation.

839
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,762
Good for business,
bad for the people.

840
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:44,396
Today on the news,
Rumsfeld was saying...

841
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:48,511
And Wolfowitz was saying:

842
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,206
"The Iraqi people are much,
much better off.

843
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:55,477
Isn't it better that we
got rid of Saddam...

844
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:59,418
...and now the Iraqi people
can do what they wanna do...

845
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,649
...and really be free?"

846
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,692
Will they ever be free?
No, they'll not be free.

847
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:07,831
And where are the weapons
of mass destruction?

848
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,933
It was a... We were duped.
We were really duped.

849
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,568
And these poor people...

850
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,967
...the young men and women
who are being killed there.

851
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,869
- It's unnecessary.
- That's a disgrace.

852
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:20,306
- That's it. No more.
- That's a disgrace.

853
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:24,106
They died in a just cause,
for defending freedom...

854
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,409
...and they will not
have died in vain.

855
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:41,962
Lila had called to tell me
she was coming down from Flint...

856
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,966
...to Washington, D. C.
To attend a jobs conference.

857
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,736
On her break, she said
she was going to go...

858
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:51,932
...and pay a visit
to the White House.

859
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,180
Bush killed children. Iraqi children.

860
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:06,220
- My son, killed.
- Killed my people in Spain, yesterday.

861
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:10,053
- Lies kill people. Your children too.
- Yes, my son.

862
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,923
They have no business to do
in Iraq now. They're killing...

863
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,689
...all these young Americans.
- Yes.

864
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,528
For what? For oil.
Bush is a terrorist.

865
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,068
- No, he isn't. This is all staged.
- Yes, he is.

866
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,433
- This is all staged.
- My son.

867
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:27,475
- Where was he killed?
- You tell me my son is not a stage.

868
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,976
- Where was he killed?
- He was killed in Karbala.

869
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,880
April 2nd. It's not a stage.
My son is dead.

870
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:38,647
There are a lot of other people too.

871
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,651
Blame al Qaeda.

872
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,332
What did that woman yell at you?

873
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,732
That I'm supposed
to blame the al Qaeda.

874
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:58,466
The al Qaeda didn't make a decision
to send my son to Iraq.

875
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,037
Ignorance that we deal with,
with everyday people.

876
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,511
Because they don't know.
People think they know...

877
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,709
...but you don't know.
I thought I knew, but I didn't know.

878
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,419
I need my son.

879
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,603
God, it's tougher than I thought
it was gonna be...

880
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,646
...to be here.

881
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,247
But it's freeing also...

882
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,284
...because I finally have a place...

883
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,981
...to put all my pain
and all my anger...

884
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,251
...and to release it.

885
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,793
I guess I was tired of seeing people
like Lila Lipscomb suffer.

886
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:04,430
Especially when, out of
the 535 members of Congress...

887
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:08,066
...only one had an enlisted son
in Iraq.

888
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:14,116
I asked Corporal Henderson of
the United States Marine Corps...

889
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,149
...to join me on Capitol Hill...

890
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,517
...to see how many members
of Congress we could convince...

891
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,659
...to enlist their children
to go to Iraq.

892
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,316
Congressman, I'm Michael Moore.

893
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,758
- Hey, Michael. How are you doing?
- Good.

894
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,694
- John Tanner, from Tennessee.
- Very nice to meet you.

895
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,266
- What y'all doing?
- I'm here with Corporal Henderson.

896
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,894
- United States Marine Corps.
- Corporal, I was in the Navy.

897
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:38,564
- 1968 to '72.
- Okay.

898
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,334
We had Marines guarding the base.

899
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,772
- You have kids?
- Yeah.

900
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,106
Is there any way we can
get them to enlist...

901
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,681
...and go over there
and help out with the effort?

902
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,978
- I've got all the brochures.
- One of them has got two children.

903
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,590
See, there's not many congressmen
that have kids over there.

904
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,988
In fact, only one. You know.

905
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,492
So we just thought maybe they...

906
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,097
- You guys should send your kids first.
- That's right.

907
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:04,564
- What do you think about that?
- I don't disagree.

908
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:07,329
You don't? Oh, good.
Well, take some brochures.

909
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,529
- At least take a Marine brochure.
- Thank you.

910
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,333
- Pass it around.
- Yeah, well...

911
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:15,171
Encourage the fellow members
if they're for the war to get behind it.

912
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:16,778
- Send their own.
- Thank you.

913
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:19,245
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

914
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,941
Congressman? Michael Moore.

915
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,553
- How you doing today?
- Good.

916
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:28,452
I'm trying to get members of Congress
to get their kids to enlist in the Army...

917
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,820
...and go over to Iraq.

918
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,061
Congressman.

919
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,663
Congressman.

920
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,061
Congressman Castle?
Congressman Castle?

921
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:39,464
Congressman. Congressman.

922
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,797
Congressman Doolittle,
Michael Moore.

923
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:43,667
I was wondering if...

924
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,539
Is there any way to?

925
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,308
Of course, not a single member
of Congress...

926
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,850
...wanted to sacrifice their child
for the war in Iraq.

927
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,319
And who could blame them?

928
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,855
Who would wanna give up
their child?

929
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,925
Would you?

930
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,857
Would he?

931
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,825
I've always been amazed
that the very people...

932
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,161
...forced to live in the worst
parts of town...

933
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,968
...go to the worst schools
and who have it the hardest...

934
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:21,076
...are always the first to step up
to defend that very system.

935
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:24,873
They serve so that
we don't have to.

936
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:29,951
They offer to give up their lives
so that we can be free.

937
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,113
It is remarkable, their gift to us.

938
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:37,124
And all they ask for in return...

939
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:40,058
...is that we never send them
into harm's way...

940
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:43,998
...unless it's absolutely necessary.

941
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:48,870
Will they ever trust us again?

942
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:51,234
He had used weapons.

943
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,636
We know where they are.

944
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:57,103
Around Tikrit, Baghdad
and east, west, south and north.

945
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,580
There is a tie between Iraq
and what happened on 9/11.

946
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,777
The struggle can only end...

947
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:06,821
...with their complete
and permanent destruction.

948
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,756
We wage a war to save
civilization itself.

949
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,154
We did not seek it.

950
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:18,629
But we will fight it,
and we will prevail.

951
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,827
George Orwell once wrote...

952
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:25,771
...that, "It's not a matter of whether
the war is not real or if it is.

953
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,240
Victory is not possible.

954
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:34,773
The war is not meant to be won.
It is meant to be continuous.

955
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,511
A hierarchical society
is only possible...

956
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,554
...on the basis of poverty
and ignorance.

957
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:43,826
This new version is the past...

958
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:46,485
...and no different past
can ever have existed.

959
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:51,026
In principle, the war effort
is always planned...

960
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,432
...to keep society
on the brink of starvation.

961
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:58,904
The war is waged by the ruling group
against its own subjects.

962
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:04,206
And its object is not the victory
over either Eurasia or East Asia...

963
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:08,613
...but to keep the very
structure of society intact."

964
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,719
There's an old saying
in T ennessee.

965
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,878
I know it's in T exas,
probably in Tennessee.

966
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,683
Fool me once...

967
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,222
...shame on...

968
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,162
Shame on you.

969
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,490
You fool me,
we can't get fooled again.

970
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,863
For once, we agreed.
