1
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,957
Was it all just a dream?

2
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:35,295
God bless you, Florida! Thank you!

3
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,199
Did the last four years
not really happen?

4
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,365
Look, there's Ben Affleck.
He's often in my dreams.

5
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,478
And the T axi Driver guy.
He was there too.

6
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,308
And little Stevie Wonder,
he seemed so happy...

7
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,815
...like a miracle had taken place.

8
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,915
Was it a dream?

9
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,386
We want Gore!

10
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,457
Or was it real?

11
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,020
It was election night 2000, and things
seemed to be going as planned.

12
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,792
In New York, Al Gore is
our projected winner.

13
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,559
The Garden State is green for Gore.

14
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:14,730
We project Mr. Gore the winner in
Delaware. This state has voted with...

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,069
Excuse me, one second.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

16
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,541
Mike, I wouldn't do this
if it weren't big.

17
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,805
Florida goes for Al Gore.

18
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:26,350
CNN announces that we call Florida
in the Al Gore column.

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,521
Then something called the Fox News
Channel called the election...

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,021
...in favor of the other guy.

21
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,992
Fox News now projects George
W. Bush the winner in Florida...

22
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,598
...and thus it appears the winner of the
presidency of the United States.

23
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,825
All of a sudden, the other
networks said:

24
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,834
"Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true."

25
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,768
All of us at the networks made
a mistake...

26
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,172
...and projected Florida
in the Al Gore column.

27
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,811
It was our mistake.

28
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,777
What most people don't know is
that the man in charge...

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,349
...of the decision desk at Fox
that night...

30
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,179
...the man who called it for Bush...

31
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,845
...was none other than Bush's
first cousin John Ellis.

32
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,117
How does someone like Bush get
away with something like this?

33
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,227
Well, first, it helps if your brother is
the governor of the state in question.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,200
You know something? We are gonna
win Florida. Mark my words.

35
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,895
You can write it down.

36
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,234
Second, make sure
your campaign chairman...

37
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,242
...is also the vote-count woman
and that her state hires a company...

38
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,614
...to knock voters off the rolls
who aren't likely to vote for you.

39
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,981
You can usually tell them
by the color of their skin.

40
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,352
Then make sure your side fights
like it's life or death.

41
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,890
This talk about legitimacy
is overblown.

42
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,659
President Bush! President Bush!

43
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,134
And hope the other side
sits by.

44
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,737
And even if numerous independent
investigations...

45
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,965
...prove that Gore got the
most votes...

46
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,701
If there was a statewide recount,
Gore won the election.

47
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,279
...it won't matter, as long as all
your daddy's friends...

48
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,849
...on the Supreme Court vote
the right way.

49
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,047
While I strongly disagree with
the court's decision, I accept it.

50
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,658
What we need now is acceptance.

51
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,695
We have a new president-elect.

52
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:24,931
It turns out none of this was a dream.
It's what really happened.

53
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,634
On the day the joint session of both
the House of Representatives...

54
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:33,404
...and the Senate was to certify
the election results...

55
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,344
...AI Gore, in his dual role
as outgoing vice president...

56
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,108
...and president of the Senate...

57
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,846
...presided over the event
that would officially anoint...

58
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,582
...George W. Bush
as the new president.

59
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:50,491
If any congressman wanted to raise
an objection, the rules insisted...

60
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:55,464
...that he or she had to have the
signed support of just one senator.

61
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,971
Mr. President, and I take great pride
in calling you that...

62
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,972
...I must object because
of the overwhelming evidence...

63
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,976
...of misconduct, deliberate fraud
and an attempt to suppress voter...

64
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,708
The chair must remind members
that under Section 18 of Title 3...

65
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,910
...United States Code, no debate
is allowed in the joint session.

66
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,488
Thank you, Mr. President.
To answer your question...

67
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:21,457
...the objection is in writing, signed
by a number of members...

68
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,826
...of the House of Representatives,
but not by a member of the Senate.

69
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:30,527
Mr. President, it is in writing and
signed by several House colleagues...

70
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:35,470
...on behalf, and myself, of the 27,000
voters of Duval County...

71
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,203
...in which 16,000 of them are
African-Americans...

72
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,213
...that was disenfranchised
in this last election.

73
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,715
Is the objection signed by a member
of the Senate?

74
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,376
Not signed by a member
of the Senate.

75
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,283
The Senate is missing.

76
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,686
It is in writing and signed
by myself...

77
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,350
...on behalf of many
of the diverse constituents...

78
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,258
...especially those
in the 9th Congressional District...

79
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,491
...and all American voters who
recognize that the Supreme Court...

80
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,569
...not the people of the United States,
decided this election.

81
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,228
Is the objection signed
by a senator?

82
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:11,571
Unfortunately, Mr. President, it is
not signed by one single senator.

83
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,475
I have no authority
over the United States Senate...

84
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,240
...and no senator has signed.

85
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,978
Mr. President, it is in writing and
signed by myself and several...

86
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:26,091
...of my constituents from Florida.
A senator is needed, but missing.

87
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,319
Is the objection in writing...

88
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,862
...and signed by a member
of the House and a senator?

89
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,262
The objection is in writing,
and I don't care...

90
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:40,031
...that it is not signed by a member
of the Senate.

91
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,107
The chair will advise that the rules
do care...

92
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:48,612
...and the signature of a senator...

93
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:54,652
Not a single senator came to the aid
of the African-Americans in Congress.

94
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,622
One after another, they were told
to sit down and shut up.

95
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,761
It's a sad day in America,
Mr. President, when we can't find...

96
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,955
...a senator to sign the objections...

97
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,158
- The gentleman will suspend...
- New Democratic senators won't sign.

98
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,135
- I object.
- The gentleman will suspend.

99
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,641
Inauguration coverage, 2001...

100
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,302
...on a nasty, but it could be worse,
kind of day in Washington.

101
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,176
- What do we want?
- Justice!

102
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,714
- When do we want it?
- Now!

103
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,485
On the day George W. Bush was
inaugurated...

104
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:32,681
...tens of thousands of Americans
poured into the streets of D. C...

105
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,158
...in one last attempt to reclaim
what had been taken from them.

106
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,996
They pelted Bush's limo with eggs...

107
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,864
Stay back! Get back!

108
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,597
...and brought the inauguration
parade to a halt.

109
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,172
The plan to have Bush get out
of the limo for the traditional walk...

110
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,575
...to the White House
was scrapped.

111
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:59,582
Bush's limo hit the gas to prevent
an even larger riot.

112
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:04,451
No president had ever witnessed
such a thing on his inauguration day.

113
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:17,196
And for the next eight months, it didn't
get any better for George W. Bush.

114
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,701
He couldn't get his judges appointed,
he struggled to pass his legislation...

115
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,710
...and he lost Republican control
of the Senate.

116
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,274
His approval ratings in the polls
began to sink.

117
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,887
He was already beginning to look
like a lame-duck president.

118
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:39,547
With everything going wrong,
he did what any of us would do.

119
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,216
He went on vacation.

120
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,336
Oh, no!

121
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,876
In his first eight months in office
before September 11th...

122
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:04,005
...George W. Bush was on vacation,
according to The Washington Post...

123
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,980
...42 percent of the time.

124
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,178
If I hit every shot good, people would
say I wasn't working.

125
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,314
It was not surprising that Mr. Bush
needed some time off.

126
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,053
Being president is a lot of work.

127
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,630
What about these folks that say that
you're taking too long of a vacation?

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,431
They don't understand the definition
of work, then.

129
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:29,841
I'm getting a lot done. You don't
have to be in Washington to work.

130
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,242
It's amazing what can happen
with telephones and faxes.

131
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,405
Thank you so much.

132
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,414
- Is this to Destiny and Bubba?
- Yeah.

133
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,110
What are you doing the rest
of the day?

134
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,223
Karen Hughes is coming over.
We're working on some things.

135
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:50,658
And she'll be over here. We're working
on a few things, a few matters.

136
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,893
I'm working on some initiatives.
We're... You'll see.

137
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,901
There'll be some decisions
I will have made while I'm here.

138
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,198
We'll be announcing them
as time goes on.

139
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,401
The first time I met him, he had
some good advice for me.

140
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,478
Governor Bush, it's Michael Moore.

141
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,981
Behave yourself, will you?
Go find real work.

142
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,416
And work was something he knew
a lot about.

143
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,647
- Anybody want some grits?
- Yeah.

144
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,217
Relaxing at Camp David.
Yachting off Kennebunkport.

145
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,260
How you doing?

146
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,989
Or being a cowboy on the ranch
in Texas.

147
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,135
I love nature, getting
in the truck with my dogs.

148
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,033
Oh, hi.

149
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,003
George Bush spent the rest
of August at the ranch...

150
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,336
...where life was less complicated.

151
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,003
Armadillos love to dig the soil
looking for bugs.

152
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,172
And...

153
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,986
So I went out there the other day,
and there was Barney...

154
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:53,615
...buried in this hole,
chasing an armadillo.

155
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,761
It was a summer to remember.

156
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,121
Afterward, he left Texas for
his second-favorite place.

157
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,667
On September 10th, he joined
his brother in Florida...

158
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,967
...where they looked at files
and met important Floridians.

159
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:15,911
He went to sleep that night in a bed
made with fine French linens.

160
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,661
Do you suppose he's pretty
confident...

161
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,200
...on those numbers on Iraqi
security forces?

162
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,290
Make me look young.

163
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,005
Yeah, I've got a little,
sort of air noise.

164
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,576
Yeah, just don't turn it up too much.
I don't want to blow my head off.

165
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,077
I got a mike here
if they want to use it.

166
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,314
Testing, one, two. This is
the Oval Office. Testing, one, two.

167
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,949
Testing, one, two.
This is the Oval Office.

168
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,823
Testing, one, two, three, four, five.

169
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,082
We have something that has
happened here...

170
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,194
...at the World Trade Center.
We noticed a flame...

171
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,024
...and an awful lot of smoke...

172
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,866
This is horrible.

173
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,086
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

174
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,519
Oh, my, dear.

175
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,726
Let's go! Let's go, back!
Come on, let's go!

176
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,457
Oh, my God!

177
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:35,704
Save their souls, Lord.
Save their souls, Lord.

178
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,942
Oh, they're jumping.

179
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,275
On September 11th, 2001,
nearly 3000 people...

180
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,551
...including a colleague of mine,
Bill Weems...

181
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:34,091
...were killed in the largest foreign
attack ever on American soil.

182
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,691
The targets were the financial
and military headquarters...

183
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,729
...of the United States.

184
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:46,132
If anyone has any idea or they've seen
him or knows where he is, to call us.

185
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:50,503
He's got two little babies.
Two little babies.

186
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,011
As the attack took place,
Mr. Bush was on his way...

187
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,012
...to an elementary school
in Florida.

188
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,913
When informed of the first plane
hitting the World Trade Center...

189
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,522
...where terrorists had struck
just eight years prior...

190
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,524
...Mr. Bush decided to go ahead
with his photo opportunity.

191
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,855
- Good morning, boys and girls.
- Good morning.

192
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,793
Good morning.

193
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,597
Read this word the fast way.
Get ready.

194
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,360
- "Mad"!
- Yes. Get ready.

195
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,028
- "Calf"!
- Yeah.

196
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,437
Get ready to read the words on this
page without making a mistake.

197
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,874
When the second plane hit
the tower...

198
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,412
...his chief of staff entered
the classroom...

199
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:34,746
...and told Mr. Bush,
"The nation is under attack."

200
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:42,393
Not knowing what to do, with no one
telling him what to do...

201
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,895
...and no Secret Service rushing
in to take him to safety...

202
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,330
...Mr. Bush just sat there...

203
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:54,803
...and continued to read
My Pet Goat with the children.

204
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,751
Nearly seven minutes passed
with nobody doing anything.

205
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,023
As Bush sat in that Florida
classroom...

206
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,724
...was he wondering if maybe
he should have shown up...

207
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,732
...to work more often?

208
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,168
Should he have held at least one
meeting since taking office...

209
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,300
...to discuss the threat of terrorism
with his head of counterterrorism?

210
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,977
Maybe Bush wondered why he had
cut terrorism funding from the FBI.

211
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,383
Or perhaps he just should have read
the security briefing...

212
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,820
...that was given to him on
August 6th, 2001...

213
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,017
...which said Osama bin Laden
was planning...

214
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,564
...to attack America by hijacking
airplanes.

215
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,328
Maybe he wasn't worried, because
the title of the report was too vague.

216
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,996
I believe the title was
"Bin Laden Determined...

217
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,142
...to Attack Inside the United States."

218
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,405
A report like that might make
some men jump...

219
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,142
...but, as in days past,
George W. Just went fishing.

220
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:19,453
As the minutes went by, George Bush
continued to sit in the classroom.

221
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:25,086
Was he thinking, "I've been hanging
out with the wrong crowd.

222
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,830
Which one of them screwed me?

223
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,596
Was it the guy my daddy's friends
delivered a lot of weapons to?

224
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,076
Was it that group of religious
fundamentalists...

225
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,236
...who visited my state when
I was governor?

226
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,846
Or was it the Saudis?

227
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,285
Damn. It was them. I think
I better blame it on this guy."

228
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,523
In the days following
September 11th...

229
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,864
...all commercial and private airline
traffic was grounded.

230
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:11,271
The FAA has taken the action to close
all of the airports in the United States.

231
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,571
Even grounding the president's
father, former President Bush...

232
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,805
...on a flight forced to land
in Milwaukee.

233
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,440
Thousands of travelers were stranded,
among them Ricky Martin...

234
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,144
...due to appear at tonight's
Latin Grammy Awards.

235
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:28,760
Not even Ricky Martin could fly.
But really, who wanted to fly?

236
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,795
No one, except the bin Ladens.

237
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,099
We had airplanes pick up...

238
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,636
...Osama bin Laden's family
and other Saudis...

239
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,473
...and transport them out
of the U.S.

240
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,146
The White House approved planes...

241
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,979
...to pick up the bin Ladens
and numerous other Saudis.

242
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:59,852
At least six private jets and nearly
two dozen commercial planes...

243
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,788
...carried the Saudis
and bin Ladens...

244
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,396
...out of the U. S. After
September 13th.

245
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:11,298
In all, 142 Saudis, including 24
members of the bin Laden family...

246
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,268
...were allowed to leave
the country.

247
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,000
Osama's always been portrayed
as the black sheep in the family...

248
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,701
...that they cut off all relationship
with him in 1994.

249
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,149
It's more complicated than that.

250
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,717
Osama has had contact with
other family members?

251
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:32,118
Right. In the summer of 2001, just
before 9/11, one of Osama's sons...

252
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,158
...got married in Afghanistan,
and several family members...

253
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,227
...showed up at the wedding.
- Bin Ladens?

254
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:41,856
That's right. So they're not cut off
completely. That's an exaggeration.

255
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,229
We now welcome to
Larry King Live...

256
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:48,305
...Prince Bandar, ambassador of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the U.S.

257
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,432
You had about 24 members
of bin Laden's family, and...

258
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,409
- Here?
- In America. Students and...

259
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,017
His Majesty felt it's not fair for those
innocent people to be subjected...

260
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:04,144
...to any harm. On the other hand,
we understood the high emotions...

261
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,884
...so, with coordination with the FBI,
we got them out.

262
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,154
This is retired FBI agent
Jack Cloonan.

263
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,767
Before 9/11, he was a senior agent
on the joint FBl-CIA...

264
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,265
...al Qaeda task force.

265
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:22,499
I, as an investigator, would not
want these people to have left.

266
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,770
I think, in the case of the bin Laden
family, it would have been prudent...

267
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:30,403
...to hand the subpoenas out, have
them come in, get on-the-record.

268
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,879
You know, get on-the-record.

269
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,847
- That's the proper procedure?
- Yeah.

270
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,644
How many people were pulled off
airlines after that...

271
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,382
...coming into the country
who were Middle Eastern...

272
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,583
...or they fit a very general picture.

273
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,856
We held hundreds of people
for weeks and months at a time.

274
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,091
Did the authorities do anything when
the bin Ladens tried to leave?

275
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,861
No. They were identified
at the airport.

276
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,837
They looked at their passports,
and they were identified.

277
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,237
That would happen to us
if we left the country.

278
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,378
- Exactly.
- Interview, check the passport.

279
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,103
- What else?
- Nothing.

280
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,276
I don't know about you,
but usually...

281
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,284
...when the police can't find
a murderer...

282
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,421
...don't they usually wanna talk
to the family members...

283
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,754
...to find out where they think
he might be?

284
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,622
You don't know
where your husband is?

285
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,454
If you hear anything,
let us know.

286
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,630
Can you come downtown,
give a statement?

287
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,199
- How long?
- You've got time.

288
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,960
Mine's worth money. Yours isn't.

289
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,866
- Send a bill.
- I asked you a question.

290
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,506
- Answer them. Don't ask them.
- I pay your salary, cop.

291
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,005
Sit down. I'm gonna earn it.

292
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,737
Yeah. That's how cops do it.
What was going on here?

293
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,380
We need to know more about that.

294
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,110
It needs to be the subject
of an investigation.

295
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,686
What happened? How did it happen?
Why? Who authorized it?

296
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,317
Imagine what those poor bastards
were feeling...

297
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,659
...when jumping off that
building to their death.

298
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,493
Those young guys and cops
and firemen...

299
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,363
...that ran into that building,
never asked a question.

300
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:02,132
And they're dead.
And families' lives are ruined.

301
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,435
- And they'll never have peace.
- That's right.

302
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,205
And if I had to inconvenience...

303
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:13,844
...a member of the bin Laden family
with a subpoena or a grand jury...

304
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,453
...do you think I'd lose sleep over it?
Not a minute.

305
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,318
No one would question it.
Not even the biggest civil libertarian.

306
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,619
- No, no. It's just...
- No one would question it.

307
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,592
You know, you got a lawyer? Fine.
Counsel? Fine.

308
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,530
Mr. Bin Laden, this is why I'm asking.
It isn't because I think you're anything.

309
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,636
I just want to ask you the questions
that I would anybody.

310
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,364
- Right.
- And that's all.

311
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,904
None of this made any sense.

312
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,006
Can you imagine in the days after
the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing...

313
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,411
...President Clinton helping to arrange
a trip...

314
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,382
...out of the country
for the McVeigh family?

315
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,418
What would have happened
to Clinton...

316
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,150
...if that had been revealed?
- Burn him! Burn him!

317
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,692
Prince Bandar, do you know
the bin Laden family?

318
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,659
- I do, very well.
- What are they like?

319
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,664
They're really lovely human beings.
He is the only one I never...

320
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,200
I don't know him well,
but I met him only once.

321
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,565
What was the circumstance
under which you met?

322
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,503
This is ironic. In the mid-'80s...

323
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,836
...if you remember,
we and the United States...

324
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,002
...were supporting the mujahideen...

325
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,911
...to liberate Afghanistan
from the Soviets.

326
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:24,112
He came to thank me for my efforts
to bring the Americans, our friends...

327
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,816
...to help us against the atheists,
the Communists. Isn't it ironic?

328
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:32,225
He came to thank you for helping
bring America to help him.

329
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,364
And now he may be responsible
for bombing America.

330
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,526
- Absolutely.
- What did you make of him?

331
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,568
- I was not impressed.
- Not impressed?

332
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,539
No. I thought he was a simple
and very quiet guy.

333
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:51,714
A simple and quiet guy, whose
family just happened to have...

334
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:57,583
...a business relationship with
the family of George W. Bush.

335
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,015
Is that what he was thinking about?

336
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:07,062
Because if the public knew this,
it wouldn't look very good.

337
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:11,131
Was he thinking, "You know...

338
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:15,569
...I need a big, black marker"?

339
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:21,474
In early 2004, in a speech during
the New Hampshire primary...

340
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,240
...I called George W. Bush
a deserter...

341
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,476
...from his time
in the Texas Air National Guard.

342
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:31,850
In response, the White House
released his military records...

343
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,719
...in the hopes of disproving
the charge.

344
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,795
What Bush didn't know is
that I already had a copy...

345
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:43,731
...of his military records, uncensored,
obtained in the year 2000.

346
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,996
And there is one glaring difference
between the records released...

347
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:52,371
...in 2000 and those he released
in 2004.

348
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,977
A name had been blacked out.

349
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,949
In 1972, two airmen were suspended
for failing to take...

350
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,525
...their medical examination.
One was George W. Bush.

351
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,057
And the other was James R. Bath.

352
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,103
In 2000, the documents show
both names.

353
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:27,010
But in 2004, Bush and the White
House had Bath's name blacked out.

354
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,410
Why didn't Bush want the press
and the public...

355
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,710
...to see Bath's name
on his military records?

356
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,321
Perhaps he was worried that the
American people would find out...

357
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,980
...that at one time, James R. Bath...

358
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,356
...was the Texas money manager
for the bin Ladens.

359
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,224
Bush and Bath had become
good friends...

360
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,664
...when they both served in the
Texas Air National Guard.

361
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,302
After they were discharged...

362
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,030
...when Bush's dad was head
of the CIA...

363
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:59,165
...Bath opened up his own aviation
business after selling a plane...

364
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,711
...to a man by the name
of Salem bin Laden...

365
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:06,248
...heir to the second-largest fortune
in Saudi Arabia...

366
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,443
...the Saudi Binladin Group.

367
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,613
W. At that time was just starting off
in the world as a businessman.

368
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,658
Because he's a guy who's always
tried to emulate his father...

369
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:21,790
...he went into the oil business.
He founded an oil company, Arbusto...

370
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,800
...which was very good at drilling dry
holes that nothing came out of.

371
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,462
But the question has always been,
"Where did this money come from?"

372
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,771
Now, his dad was rich. His dad
could have done this for him...

373
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,004
...but his dad didn't do this for him.

374
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,277
There's no indication Daddy wrote a
check to start him off in his company.

375
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,712
So where did George W. Bush
get his money?

376
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,617
I'm George Bush.

377
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,123
One person who did invest in him
was James R. Bath.

378
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,630
Bush's good friend, James Bath,
was hired by the bin Laden family...

379
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,793
...to manage their money in Texas
and invest in businesses.

380
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:09,711
And James Bath himself, in turn,
invested in George W. Bush.

381
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,313
Bush ran Arbusto into the ground...

382
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,284
...as he did every other company
he was involved in...

383
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:22,017
...until finally one of his companies
was bought by Harken Energy...

384
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,322
...and they gave him a seat
on their board.

385
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,958
A lot of us suspected through
the years that there has been...

386
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,330
...Saudi oil money involved
in these companies:

387
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:37,771
Harken, Spectrum 7, Arbusto
Drilling, all the Bush companies.

388
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,934
Whenever they got in trouble,
there were these angel investors...

389
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,046
...who flowed money into
the companies.

390
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:47,617
The question is, why would Saudis,
who had all the oil in the world...

391
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:52,553
...go around the globe to invest
in this lousy oil company?

392
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:56,751
And the thing is, Harken had one
big thing going for it...

393
00:29:56,928 --> 00:30:00,386
...which is that George W. Bush
was on its board of directors...

394
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,728
...at a time when his father was
president of the United States.

395
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,928
When you're the president's son
and you've got unlimited access...

396
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,202
...combined with some credentials
from a prior campaign...

397
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:15,403
...in Washington, D.C., people tend
to respect that. Access is power.

398
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,176
And I can find my dad and talk
to him any time of the day.

399
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,712
Yes, it helps
to be the president's son...

400
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,015
...especially when you're being
investigated...

401
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,421
...by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

402
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,426
In 1990, when Mr. Bush was
a director of Harken Energy...

403
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,757
...he received this memo
from company lawyers...

404
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,366
...warning directors not to sell stock
if they had...

405
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,764
...unfavorable information about
the company.

406
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:43,169
One week later, he sold $848,000
worth of Harken stock.

407
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,209
Two months later, Harken announced
losses of more than $23 million.

408
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,844
The James Baker law partner
who helped Bush...

409
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,039
...beat the rap from the SEC...

410
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,879
...was a man by the name
of Robert Jordan...

411
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,749
...who, when George W. Became
president...

412
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:02,188
...was appointed ambassador
to Saudi Arabia.

413
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,664
After the Harken debacle, the friends
of Bush's dad got him a seat...

414
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:14,168
...on another board, of a company
owned by the Carlyle Group.

415
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,899
We looked at which companies gained
from September 11 th.

416
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,278
We turned up this company, Carlyle
Group, a multinational conglomerate...

417
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,246
...that invests in heavily
government-regulated industries...

418
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:31,548
...like telecommunications, health care
and particularly, defense.

419
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,658
Both George W. Bush
and George H.W. Bush...

420
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:38,057
...worked for the Carlyle Group,
the same company that counted...

421
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,959
...the bin Laden family among
its investors.

422
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,094
The Carlyle Group was holding
its annual investor conference...

423
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,067
...on the morning
of September 11th...

424
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,638
...in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel
in Washington D.C.

425
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:54,471
At that meeting were
all of the Carlyle regulars...

426
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,104
...James Baker, likely John Major,
definitely George H.W. Bush...

427
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,843
...though he left the morning
of September 11th.

428
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,978
Shafiq bin Laden, who is
Osama bin Laden's half brother...

429
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:10,617
...was in town to look after his family's
investments in the Carlyle Group.

430
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,854
All of them together in one room,
watching...

431
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,296
...as the planes hit the towers.

432
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,492
In fact, the bin Laden family
was invested...

433
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,401
...in one of their defense funds,
which ironically meant...

434
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:28,534
...that as the U.S. Increased defense
spending, the bin Laden family...

435
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,944
...stood to gain from those investments
through the Carlyle Group.

436
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:37,179
Our commander in chief,
President George W. Bush.

437
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,550
With all the weapons companies
it owned...

438
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,454
...the Carlyle Group was, in essence,
the 11th largest...

439
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,494
...defense contractor
in the United States.

440
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:49,190
- Thanks a lot.
- It owned United Defense...

441
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,767
...makers of the Bradley armored
fighting vehicle.

442
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:56,532
September 11th guaranteed that
United Defense...

443
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,836
...was going to have
a very good year.

444
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,445
Just six weeks after 9/11...

445
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,550
...Carlyle filed to take
United Defense public...

446
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,744
...and made a one-day profit
of $237 million.

447
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,516
But sadly, with so much attention
focused...

448
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:20,186
...on the bin Laden family being
important Carlyle investors...

449
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,991
...the bin Ladens eventually
had to withdraw.

450
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,102
Bush's dad, though, stayed on
as senior adviser...

451
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,967
...to Carlyle's Asia board
for another two years.

452
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:36,102
As unseemly as it seems
to know that George H.W. Bush...

453
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,578
...was meeting
with the bin Laden family...

454
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:45,178
...while Osama was a wanted terrorist,
well before September 11 th...

455
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,884
...it's very discomforting
for Americans to know that.

456
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:54,725
George H.W. Bush is a man who
has, obviously, incredible reach...

457
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,389
...into the White House.

458
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:01,931
He receives daily CIA briefings,
which is the right of any ex-president...

459
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:06,406
...but very few ex-presidents
actually exercise that right. He does.

460
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:11,071
And, I think, in a very real way they
are benefiting from the confusion...

461
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,480
...that arises when George H.W. Bush
visits Saudi Arabia...

462
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:18,452
...on behalf of Carlyle
and meets with the royal family...

463
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,955
...and meets
with the bin Laden family.

464
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,855
Is he representing the United States
of America?

465
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,623
Or is he representing an investment
firm in the United States?

466
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,664
Or is he representing both?

467
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:33,235
This company is about money,
not conspiracies to run the world...

468
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:37,773
...or engineer political maneuvering
and things like that.

469
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,173
It's about making money,
and it's about making a lot of money.

470
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,745
And they've done very well.

471
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,047
I could get you on-the-record
on this question.

472
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,546
In the White House view,
there is no ethical conflict...

473
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:57,626
...in former President Bush and
former Secretary of State Jim Baker...

474
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,821
...using their contacts
with world leaders to represent...

475
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:05,958
...one of the most well-known military
arms dealers, the Carlyle Group?

476
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:10,836
The president has full faith
that his family will conform...

477
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:14,876
...with all proper ethics laws
and will act properly in their conduct.

478
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,982
Okay, let's say one group of people,
like the American people...

479
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,415
...pay you $400,000 a year
to be president of the United States.

480
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,647
But then another group of people
invest in you, your friends...

481
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:32,626
...and their related businesses,
$ 1. 4 billion over a number of years.

482
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,527
Who are you gonna like?
Who's your daddy?

483
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,035
That's how much the Saudi royals
and their associates...

484
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:44,971
...have given the Bush family, their
friends and their related businesses...

485
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,838
...in the past three decades.

486
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,445
Seems like a very nice reunion
with friends.

487
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,208
Is it rude to suggest
that when the Bush family...

488
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,147
...wakes up in the morning,
they might be thinking...

489
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:00,347
...about what's best for the Saudis
instead of what's best for you or me?

490
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,794
Because 1.4 billion just doesn't buy
a lot of flights out of the country.

491
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,157
It buys a lot of love.

492
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,382
Sooner or later,
this special relationship...

493
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,419
...with a regime that Amnesty
International condemns...

494
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,114
...as a widespread human-rights
violator...

495
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,054
...would come back to haunt
the Bushes.

496
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,063
Now, after 9/11, it was
an embarrassment.

497
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,758
And they preferred that no one
ask any questions.

498
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,198
Investigation should have begun
on September 12th.

499
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,905
There's no reason it shouldn't have.
Three thousand were dead.

500
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,600
It should've gotten started
immediately.

501
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,177
First, Bush tried to stop Congress
from setting up...

502
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:34,317
...its own 9/11 investigation.
- It's important for us...

503
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,451
...to not reveal how
we collect information.

504
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,750
That's what the enemy wants.
And we're fighting an enemy.

505
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,860
When he couldn't stop Congress,
he then tried to stop...

506
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,088
...an independent 9/11 commission
from being formed.

507
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,529
The president's position was a break
from history.

508
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,635
Independent investigations were
launched after Pearl Harbor...

509
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,668
...and President Kennedy's
assassination.

510
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,706
But when Congress did complete
its own investigation...

511
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,038
...the Bush White House
censored 28 pages of the report.

512
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:05,080
The president is being pressed
by all sides to declassify the report.

513
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,184
U.S. Officials tell NBC News
most of the secret sources...

514
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,013
...involve Saudi Arabia.

515
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:15,887
We've given extraordinary cooperation
with Chairmen Kean and Hamilton.

516
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,051
We haven't gotten the materials
we needed...

517
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,891
...and haven't gotten them
in a timely fashion.

518
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,057
Will you testify
before the commission?

519
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:28,569
This commission? You know, I don't...
Testify? I'd be glad to visit with them.

520
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,300
What it will do is, the hole
that's in my heart...

521
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,808
...and has been in my heart
since September 11th...

522
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:42,480
I lost my husband of 15 years.
I am now by myself.

523
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,990
I need to know what happened
to him.

524
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:53,220
I know what I got back
from the autopsy.

525
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:57,959
That man was my life,
and I have no plan.

526
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,036
I was taking a class,
and they asked me...

527
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,639
...what was I gonna do in the next
five years.

528
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,403
And if I'm not doing something
with this, I don't know what reason...

529
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:11,207
...I have to live.
So it's very important.

530
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,508
Very important. Okay.

531
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,677
Okay.

532
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,183
Ignored by the Bush administration...

533
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,385
...more than 500 relatives
of 9/11 victims...

534
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,827
...filed suit against Saudi royals
and others.

535
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,432
The lawyers the Saudi
defense minister hired...

536
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,569
...to fight the 9/11 families?

537
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:38,175
The law firm of Bush family confidant,
James A. Baker.

538
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:41,903
So right here in the center of three
important American landmarks...

539
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,606
...the Watergate Hotel
and office building...

540
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,149
...the Kennedy Center over there...

541
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,813
...and the embassy of Saudi Arabia.

542
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,419
Yeah.

543
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:58,221
How much money do the Saudis
have invested in America, roughly?

544
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,298
I've heard figures as high
as $860 billion.

545
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,458
- Eight hundred and sixty billion?
- Billion.

546
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,070
- That's a lot of money.
- A lot, yeah.

547
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,835
And what percentage of our economy
does that represent?

548
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,272
It seems like a lot.

549
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:18,245
Well, in terms of investments
on Wall Street in American equities...

550
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,079
...it's roughly 6 or 7 percent
of America.

551
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,778
They own a fairly good slice
of America.

552
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,015
Most of that money goes into
the great blue-chip companies.

553
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:32,128
Citigroup, Citibank,
the largest stockholder is a Saudi.

554
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:35,959
AOL-Time Warner has
big Saudi investors.

555
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:39,261
So I read where, like, the Saudis have
a trillion dollars...

556
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,429
...in our banks of their money.
What would happen...

557
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,574
...if they pulled that trillion out?

558
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:48,269
A trillion dollars? That would be
an enormous blow to the economy.

559
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,276
Can I speak to you for a moment,
please, sir?

560
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,883
- How are you doing?
- Good, how you doing?

561
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:58,044
Steve Kimball with the Secret Service.
We're just ascertaining information.

562
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,191
Are you doing a documentary
on the Saudi Arabian Embassy?

563
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,385
No. I am doing a documentary,
and part of it is about Saudi Arabia.

564
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,225
Even though we were nowhere near
the White House...

565
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,130
...the Secret Service had shown up
to ask us what we were doing...

566
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,703
...standing across the street
from the Saudi Embassy.

567
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,534
- We're not here to cause any trouble.
- Okay.

568
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,268
- You know. Is that...?
- No, that's fine.

569
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,470
We just wanted to get
some information as far as...

570
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,080
What's going on, yeah.

571
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,446
I didn't realize the Secret Service
guards foreign embassies.

572
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,611
- Not usually, no, sir.
- No. Do they give you any trouble?

573
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,781
- Saudis?
- No comment on that.

574
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,756
Okay, I'll take that as a yes.

575
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,292
Good. Thank you very much.

576
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,124
It turns out that Saudi Prince Bandar
is perhaps...

577
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,562
...the best-protected ambassador
in the U.S.

578
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:47,864
The U.S. State Department provides
him with a six-man security detail.

579
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,973
Considering how he and his family
and the Saudi elite...

580
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:56,238
...own 7 percent of America,
it's probably not a bad idea.

581
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,911
Prince Bandar was so close
to the Bushes...

582
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,484
...they considered him a member
of the family.

583
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,952
They even had a nickname for him:
Bandar Bush.

584
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:10,492
Two nights after September 11th,
George Bush invited Bandar Bush...

585
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:14,791
...over to the White House
for a private dinner and a talk.

586
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,593
Even though bin Laden
was a Saudi...

587
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,601
...and Saudi money
had funded al Qaeda...

588
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:24,400
...and 15 of the 19 hijackers
were Saudis...

589
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,406
...here was the Saudi ambassador,
casually dining with the president...

590
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,979
...on September 13th.

591
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,311
What were they talking about?

592
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:38,615
Were they commiserating
or comparing notes?

593
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,816
Why would Bandar's government...

594
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,626
...block American investigators
from talking to the relatives...

595
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,287
...of the 15 hijackers?

596
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,230
Why would Saudi Arabia
become reluctant...

597
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,633
...to freeze the hijackers' assets?

598
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,937
The two of them walked out
on the Truman Balcony...

599
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:04,603
...so that Bandar could smoke a cigar
and have a drink.

600
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:10,817
In the distance, across the Potomac,
was the Pentagon, partially in ruins.

601
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:15,118
I wonder if Mr. Bush
told Prince Bandar not to worry...

602
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,989
...because he already had a plan
in motion.

603
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:20,097
You come in September 12th...

604
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,223
You come in September 12th...

605
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,525
...to plot our response to al Qaeda.
Let me talk about the response...

606
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,104
...you got from top administration
officials.

607
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,707
On that day, what did the president
say to you?

608
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:36,209
The president, in a very intimidating
way, left me and my staff...

609
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,349
...with the clear indication
he wanted us to come back...

610
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,542
...with the word that there was
an Iraqi hand behind 9/11.

611
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,451
They planned to do something about
Iraq before they came into office.

612
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,491
Did he ask about any other nations
other than Iraq?

613
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,061
No, not at all. It was, "Iraq, Saddam,
find out, get back to me."

614
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,824
Were his questions more about Iraq
than al Qaeda?

615
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,264
Absolutely. He didn't ask me
about al Qaeda.

616
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:01,404
And the reaction you got from
the defense secretary, Rumsfeld...

617
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,972
...from his assistant, Paul Wolfowitz?

618
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,609
Donald Rumsfeld said...
When we talked about bombing...

619
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,972
...the al Qaeda infrastructure
in Afghanistan...

620
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,671
...he said, "There are
no good targets in Afghanistan.

621
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,077
Let's bomb Iraq."

622
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,946
And we said, "But Iraq had nothing
to do with this."

623
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,055
That didn't make much difference.
The reason they had...

624
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,954
...to do Afghanistan first was, it was
obvious al Qaeda attacked us.

625
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:26,028
And it was obvious that al Qaeda
was in Afghanistan.

626
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,723
Americans wouldn't stand by
if we'd done nothing on Afghanistan.

627
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,049
The United States began bombing
Afghanistan...

628
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,780
...just four weeks after 9/11.
Mr. Bush said he was doing so...

629
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,618
...because the Taliban government
of Afghanistan...

630
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,284
...had been harboring bin Laden.

631
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,025
We will smoke them
out of their holes.

632
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,563
We're gonna smoke them out.

633
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:06,760
- We'll smoke him out of his cave.
- Let's rush them and smoke them out.

634
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:11,636
For all his tough talk,
Bush really didn't do much.

635
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,801
Well, what they did was slow
and small.

636
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:18,004
They put only 11,000 troops
into Afghanistan.

637
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,241
There are more police here
in Manhattan.

638
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,818
More in Manhattan than there are
U.S. Troops in Afghanistan.

639
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:27,946
The president botched the response.
He should have gone after bin Laden.

640
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,856
The U.S. Special Forces didn't get into
the area where bin Laden was...

641
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,624
...for two months.
- Two months?

642
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,324
A mass murderer who attacked
the United States...

643
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,993
...was given a two-month head start?

644
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,833
Who in their right mind
would do that?

645
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,737
- Dang! Anybody say "nice shot"?
- Nice shot.

646
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,468
Hell of a shot.

647
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:52,308
Or was the war in Afghanistan
really about something else?

648
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:56,010
Perhaps the answer
was in Houston, Texas.

649
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:02,456
In 1997, while George W. Bush
was governor of Texas...

650
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:06,858
...a delegation of Taliban leaders
from Afghanistan flew to Houston...

651
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,089
...to meet with Unocal executives...

652
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,565
...to discuss the building of a pipeline
through Afghanistan...

653
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,762
...bringing natural gas
from the Caspian Sea.

654
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,430
And who got a Caspian Sea
drilling contract...

655
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,442
...the same day Unocal
signed the pipeline deal?

656
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,480
A company headed by a man
named Dick Cheney. Halliburton.

657
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:27,810
From the point of view
of the U.S. Government...

658
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,216
...this was kind of a magic pipeline...

659
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,720
...because it could serve
so many purposes.

660
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:37,258
And who else stood to benefit
from the pipeline?

661
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,726
Bush's number-one campaign
contributor, Kenneth Lay...

662
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,366
...and the good people of Enron.

663
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,532
Only the British press
covered this trip.

664
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:51,534
Then in 2001, just five and a half
months before 9/11...

665
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,578
...the Bush administration welcomed
a Taliban envoy...

666
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,304
...to tour the United States...

667
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,348
...to help improve the image
of the Taliban government.

668
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:04,078
You have imprisoned the women.
It's a horror, let me tell you.

669
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:07,553
I'm sorry to your husband. He must
have a difficult time with you.

670
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,522
Here is the Taliban official
visiting our State Department...

671
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,790
...to meet with U.S. Officials.

672
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,829
Why would the Bush administration
allow a Taliban leader...

673
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,027
...to visit the United States,
knowing that the Taliban...

674
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:24,504
...were harboring the man
who bombed the U.S.S. Cole...

675
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,235
...and our African embassies?

676
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:31,040
Well, I guess 9/11 put a stop to that.

677
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:34,207
When the invasion of Afghanistan
was complete...

678
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,717
...we installed its new president,
Hamid Karzai.

679
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,254
Who was Hamid Karzai?

680
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:43,860
He was a former adviser to Unocal.

681
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,019
Bush also appointed,
as our envoy to Afghanistan...

682
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:52,760
...Zalmay Khalilzad, who was also
a former Unocal adviser.

683
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,536
I guess you can probably see
where this is leading.

684
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,973
Faster than you can say, "Black gold,
Texas tea, " Afghanistan signed...

685
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,544
...an agreement with her
neighboring countries...

686
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,811
...to build a pipeline carrying
natural gas from the Caspian Sea.

687
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,310
Oh, and the Taliban?

688
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,747
Oh, they mostly got away.

689
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,557
As did Osama bin Laden
and most of al Qaeda.

690
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,657
T error is bigger than one person.

691
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:26,132
And he's a person who's now
been marginalized.

692
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,793
So I don't know where he is.

693
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,270
I just don't spend that much time
on him, to be honest with you.

694
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:35,400
Didn't spend much time on him?
What kind of president was he?

695
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:39,512
I'm a war president. I make decisions
here in the Oval Office...

696
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,982
...in foreign policy matters
with war on my mind.

697
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:47,079
With the war in Afghanistan over
and bin Laden forgotten...

698
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,851
...the war president had
a new target:

699
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,690
The American people.

700
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:01,529
We've got an unusual terror warning
from the feds to tell you about.

701
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,764
Fox News has obtained
an FBI bulletin...

702
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,399
...that warns terrorists could use
pen guns, like in James Bond...

703
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,602
...filled with poison.
- Good evening.

704
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,341
America is on high alert tonight,
just four days before Christmas.

705
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:17,954
- A possible terror threat.
- As bad as or worse than 9/11.

706
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,716
But where? How?
There's nothing specific to report.

707
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,828
Be on the lookout for model airplanes
packed with explosives.

708
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:31,092
The FBI is warning ferries may be
considered particularly at risk...

709
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,202
...for hijacking.

710
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,601
Could these cattle be a target
for terrorists?

711
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,267
- Fear works.
- Fear does work, yes.

712
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,112
You can make people do anything
if they're afraid.

713
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,046
And how do you make them afraid?

714
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:53,884
Well, you make them afraid
by creating an aura of endless threat.

715
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,649
They played us like an organ.

716
00:49:55,826 --> 00:50:00,695
They raised the orange, up to red,
then they dropped it back to orange.

717
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:04,891
I mean, they gave these mixed
messages, which were crazy-making.

718
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:08,435
The world is changed
after September the 11th.

719
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,937
It's changed because
we're no longer safe.

720
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:15,340
Fly and enjoy America's
great destination spots.

721
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,538
We have entered what may
prove to be the most dangerous...

722
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,910
...security environment
the world's known.

723
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,575
Take your families and enjoy life.

724
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,984
Terrorists are doing everything
they can...

725
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,454
...to gain even deadlier means
of striking us.

726
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,826
- Go down to Disney World in Florida.
- It's like training a dog.

727
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,830
You tell him sit down and roll over
at the same time, dog doesn't know...

728
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,060
...what to do. American people
were being treated like that.

729
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:45,140
It was very, very skillfully and ugly,
in what they did.

730
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,742
We must stop the terror.

731
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:54,316
I call upon all nations to do everything
they can to stop these terrorist killers.

732
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,644
Thank you.

733
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,048
Now watch this drive.

734
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,756
All right. You give me another one.

735
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:08,123
They will continue, in my view, as long
as this administration is in charge...

736
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:12,530
...of every once in a while,
stimulating everybody to be afraid.

737
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,135
Just in case you forgot.

738
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:18,604
It's not gonna go down to green
or blue. It's never gonna get there.

739
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:22,211
There clearly is no way
that anyone...

740
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,678
...can live constantly on edge
like that.

741
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,612
The reality facing
American families...

742
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,279
...is they're not as safe
as they used to be.

743
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,049
Drug dealers and users looking
for their next fix.

744
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:37,250
Gangs who roam the streets
in search of their next victim.

745
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,022
And the growing threat of terrorists
means the need for protection...

746
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,429
...is ever greater.
And now that protection is here.

747
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,970
Zytech Engineering, LLC has
developed and tested a safe room...

748
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,108
...finally affordable to the average
American citizen.

749
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:56,041
Protection formerly obtainable
only by the wealthy or powerful.

750
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:59,774
Heck, you can be sitting in here,
drinking your finest Bordeaux...

751
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:04,114
...and enjoying life, while chaos
is erupting outside.

752
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:07,582
Every family in America
should prepare itself...

753
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,520
...for a terrorist attack.

754
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:13,520
Now to escaping from a skyscraper.
John Rivers is the CEO...

755
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:17,997
...of the Executive Chute Corporation.
Good morning to you, John.

756
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,228
- Good morning, Matt.
- Tell me about the product.

757
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:25,500
It's an emergency escape chute.
It's an option of last resort.

758
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,700
How high do you have to be
in the building...

759
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,506
...for that chute to actually
take effect?

760
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,478
You only have to be on the 10th floor
or above.

761
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,675
They can put this on themselves?

762
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,252
Right. They can put this on
themselves in as easy...

763
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,549
...as about 30 seconds.
It's real easy to put on.

764
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,289
- Here.
- Sorry.

765
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,987
That's okay. Real easy to put on,
but...

766
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,396
When you first get this chute,
you're gonna wanna put it on...

767
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:55,334
...and try it on a few times yourself.
- Jaime's having trouble putting that on.

768
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,908
Is this something that you honestly
think, in a moment of panic...

769
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,375
...that someone can operate
properly?

770
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:07,176
Oh, yeah. It is. This is actually...
Jamie's probably never...

771
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,580
...put this thing on before in her life.

772
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,049
It's okay. It's something that,
when you get it...

773
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,623
...you're gonna wanna put it on
several times.

774
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:19,455
Despite the raising of the terror alert
level, residents here continue...

775
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:21,426
...with their Christmas errands.

776
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:24,829
Frances and her family do some
last-minute holiday shopping...

777
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,435
...knowing al Qaeda is planning
to attack.

778
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,767
She says being in Saginaw doesn't
make her feel any safer...

779
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,966
...than if she was in New York City.

780
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,371
Midland is close by...

781
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,971
...and I said,
"Detroit's not that far away."

782
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:42,107
I said, "That could be something...
And Flint could be something... Be...

783
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:45,220
...concerns for people around here."
- You never know...

784
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,413
...where they're gonna hit.
Never know.

785
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,719
But one potential target specifically
mentioned by the terrorists...

786
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:55,228
...has security officials baffled.
It's tiny Tappahannock, Virginia...

787
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,059
...population, 2016.

788
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,362
Such an attack could generate
widespread fear...

789
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:05,941
...that even here in rural, small-town
America, no one is entirely safe.

790
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,944
On the news there was
an alert in Tappahannock.

791
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:13,146
- What did the FBI tell you?
- Well, they contacted me by phone.

792
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,582
Basically let me know about this,
were it Tappahannock.

793
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,520
- That's how it started.
- In the so-called chatter they pick up...

794
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:25,149
...they wasn't sure Tappahannock.
There's a Rappahannock County...

795
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,229
...Rappahannock River.
- There is a Rappahannock...

796
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,992
A place called Rappahannock.
They got it mixed up.

797
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,169
This is Tappahannock,
not Rappahannock.

798
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,465
- Is there any target around here?
- Not that we can think of.

799
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,506
- It can happen anywhere.
- Wal-Mart.

800
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,644
A big spaghetti supper in here.

801
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,108
Wal-Mart, probably.

802
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,680
Do you feel extra suspicious
of outsiders?

803
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,908
Oh, everybody does that.

804
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,984
That's just something that happens.

805
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:53,611
When I look at certain people,
I wonder, "Oh, my goodness.

806
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,951
Do you think they could be
a terrorist?"

807
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,253
- Never know what's gonna happen.
- Right.

808
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,895
It could happen right now.

809
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,355
Never trust nobody you don't know.

810
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:07,830
And even if you do know them,
you really can't trust them then.

811
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,196
From Tappahannock
to Rappahannock...

812
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:16,038
...to every town and village in
America, the people were afraid.

813
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,970
And they turned to their leader
to protect them.

814
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,414
But protect them from what?

815
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:50,041
Meet John Ashcroft.

816
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:54,650
In 2000, he was running for
re-election as senator for Missouri...

817
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:58,982
...against a man who died
the month before the election.

818
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:02,215
The voters preferred the dead guy.

819
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:07,022
So George W. Bush made him
his attorney general.

820
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,563
He was sworn in on a stack
of Bibles.

821
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,860
Because when you can't beat
a dead guy...

822
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,333
...you need all the help you can get.

823
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,529
During the summer before 9/11...

824
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,698
...Ashcroft told acting FBI director,
Thomas Pickard...

825
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,573
...that he didn't want to hear
anything more about terrorist threats.

826
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:28,013
Mr. Watson had come to you and said
that the CIA was very concerned...

827
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,152
...that there would be an attack.

828
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,723
You said that you told the attorney
general this fact repeatedly...

829
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,882
...in these meetings. That correct?

830
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,857
I've told him at least
on two occasions.

831
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,092
And you told the staff,
according to this statement...

832
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:47,930
...Mr. Ashcroft told you that he did not
want to hear about this anymore.

833
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,800
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

834
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,375
His own FBI knew that summer
there were al Qaeda members...

835
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:58,503
...in the U.S. And bin Laden was
sending his agents to flight schools...

836
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,308
...around the country.

837
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:04,010
But Ashcroft's Justice Department
turned a blind eye...

838
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,654
...and a deaf ear.

839
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:10,054
But after 9/11, John Ashcroft
had some brilliant ideas...

840
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,160
...for how to protect America.

841
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,990
The Patriot Act, adopted by Congress
and signed by Bush...

842
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,860
...six weeks after the attacks...

843
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,433
...has changed the way
the government does business.

844
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:23,902
The Patriot Act allows for searches
of medical and financial records...

845
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,234
...computer and telephone
conversations...

846
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:30,436
...even for the books you take out of
the library. But people we spoke to...

847
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,946
...say they're willing to give up
liberties to fight terrorism.

848
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:38,451
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- It's sad, but it has to be done.

849
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,182
Yes, something needed to be done.

850
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,691
These are the good people
who make up Peace Fresno.

851
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:48,922
A community group
in Fresno, California.

852
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:52,801
Unlike the rest of us,
they received an early lesson...

853
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,699
...in what the Patriot Act is all about.

854
00:57:55,872 --> 00:58:00,206
Each week, they meet to discuss
matters of peace.

855
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:05,746
They sit around, they share stories,
they eat cookies.

856
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,509
Some have more than one.

857
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:13,149
This is Aaron Stokes,
a member of Peace Fresno.

858
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,315
The other members liked him.

859
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,222
He had come to the meetings,
he went with us.

860
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:22,330
We go out on Friday nights and stand
on a very busy corner in Fresno.

861
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,627
And he had gone with us,
he had handed out fliers.

862
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:29,932
He went with us in June
to a WTO protest.

863
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:33,007
Then one day, Aaron didn't show up
to the meeting.

864
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,509
My friend Dan and I were reading
the Sunday newspaper...

865
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,342
...and when I picked up the paper,
in the local section...

866
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,246
...Aaron's picture caught my eye.

867
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,478
The article said that a sheriff's deputy
had been killed...

868
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:49,182
...and I saw it had a name
that wasn't the right name...

869
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,729
...that said that he was a member
of the sheriff's antiterrorism unit.

870
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,263
That's right.

871
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:58,992
The photo of the man
in the newspaper...

872
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,501
...was not the Aaron Stokes
they had come to know.

873
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:09,134
He was actually Deputy Aaron Kilner,
and he had infiltrated their group.

874
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,008
Sheriff Pierce made it very clear
that, yes...

875
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:15,241
...Aaron Kilner was assigned
to infiltrate Peace Fresno...

876
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:18,649
...that he was able to infiltrate
organizations...

877
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,584
...that are open to the public.

878
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,686
You could understand why the police
needed to spy...

879
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,623
...on a group like Peace Fresno.

880
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,657
Just look at them.

881
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,459
A gathering of terrorists
if I ever saw one.

882
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:36,094
This is Barry Reingold,
a retired phone worker...

883
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,797
...from Oakland, California.

884
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,910
Barry likes to work out in the gym.

885
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,411
Somewhere between his cardio
and his strength training...

886
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,073
...Barry got political.

887
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,880
We were up in the gym,
and it was after we were working out...

888
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:55,923
...and a number of us were talking
about 9/11 and Afghanistan...

889
00:59:56,092 --> 01:00:00,461
...and bin Laden, and someone said,
"Bin Laden's a real asshole...

890
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,963
...for murdering those people."
And I said, "Yeah, that's true.

891
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,694
But he'll never be as big
an asshole as Bush...

892
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,464
...who bombs all over the world
for oil profits."

893
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,371
Barry didn't have to worry
about the police spying on him.

894
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:18,474
His fellow weightlifters
were more than willing to turn him in.

895
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:23,449
I was taking a nap, and I guess
it was 1:30, 2:00 in the afternoon.

896
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,681
And they came to my place,
and I said, "Well, who's there?"

897
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:32,760
And they said, "The FBI."
I said, "The FBI? Why are they here?"

898
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:38,265
Yes, the FBI had come to see Barry.
And they weren't there to Jazzercise.

899
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:44,270
The FBI said, "Have you been talking
to people about 9/11 and bin Laden...

900
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,900
...and oil profits and Afghanistan?"
I said, "A lot of people are talking...

901
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,875
...about these things."

902
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:54,983
I feel my rights have been,
you know, trampled on.

903
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:59,281
I mean, if you have something to say
to me in the gym, well, then, fine.

904
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:04,518
Don't tell the FBI, and they come to
my apartment while I'm taking a nap.
