1
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,106
Do you use ketamine?

2
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,741
No, pentobarbital.

3
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,543
The first injection
will induce sleep.

4
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:49,081
So any pain sunny-girl is
experiencing will stop.

5
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,451
The second injection will
slowly shut down her functions.

6
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,719
Then she can have a
blessed eternal rest.

7
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,429
Are you a professional or
a psychic pet whisperer?

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,279
There's not much that can be
done because of her age, Mel.

9
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,581
Her stomach's flipped.

10
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,249
The surgery would
be too stressful.

11
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,453
She just-- she wouldn't survive.

12
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,221
Oh, Jack.

13
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,402
Goodbye, proud girl.

14
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,559
I appreciate you getting
sunny-girl and me.

15
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,298
I know this is
killing you inside.

16
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,203
Take the time.

17
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:18,770
Let it play out.

18
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,584
Do you want that box of
notebooks still in the hallway?

19
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,222
I'll get it when
i pick up the rest

20
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,457
of the stuff from the garage.

21
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,393
Which will be?

22
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,895
I've got a review tomorrow.

23
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,730
The alfa needs a battery.

24
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,798
And I'm sleeping on a couch
in my mother's studio.

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,269
That's why I haven't collected
the rest of my things.

26
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,471
I see your follow-through
outside the lab hasn't changed.

27
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,943
I'll speak with you later.

28
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,746
Jack.

29
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:03,782
Don't shove it aside, ok?

30
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,684
It'll come back and kick
you in the ass later.

31
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,329
Morning, Medina.

32
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,396
Cheers, ram.

33
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,434
Sunny-girl?

34
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,837
She went last evening.

35
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,308
Arey.

36
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,876
I thought she would
have a couple months.

37
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:05,677
I know.

38
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,479
It's so sad.

39
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,547
Is Dr. sutree ok?

40
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,817
When you think of
smell detection,

41
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,286
it's the nose interacting
with the brain.

42
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,721
Olfaction.

43
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,323
We are the only
research group seriously

44
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:23,895
looking into the molecular basis
of olfaction involving sight.

45
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,965
Does this liquid emit an odor?

46
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,304
Its molecules have to be
wafting through the air,

47
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,306
and our noses have
to be fairly close.

48
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,642
But if you could see
odors, think of how helpful

49
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,011
You'd know something
about the contents

50
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,946
without the
unpleasant experience.

51
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,515
A major gas leak could be
detected from miles away.

52
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,850
I probably even know
which one of you

53
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,386
had coffee brewed from
robusta beans this morning.

54
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:51,623
This is quite a departure
from the original study, Jack.

55
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,593
I mean, insects
carry a large number

56
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:55,927
of debilitating diseases.

57
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,629
Stopping that spread
has always been

58
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,067
about using traditional methods
to identify what attracts them.

59
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,535
Don't underestimate light.

60
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,338
Light.

61
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,773
It's a food.

62
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,742
It nourishes our bodies
with vitamin d. It has mass.

63
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,678
It occupies space.

64
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,913
We now know it can be
slowed and stopped.

65
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,748
Yes, stopped.

66
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,917
It actually behaves differently
when it's being observed,

67
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,953
almost like it's imbued
with a consciousness.

68
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,390
Multiple wavelengths
of light mixed together

69
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,894
give us white light, a
mixture of frequencies,

70
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,630
all processed by our cortex.

71
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:35,434
But odors-- the cortex must
process different chemical

72
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:40,439
structures and match them to a
stored database of known odors.

73
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:44,376
I think current methods to
understand this limit us.

74
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,079
They limit all olfactory-based
research, every single project

75
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,814
in the world.

76
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:52,651
If we can use light to
visualize specific pheromones,

77
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,920
we've taken it to
the next level.

78
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,422
Will your work also show
us why people near death

79
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,926
see a white light?

80
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,995
One concept our learned
colleagues in this room

81
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,932
are familiar with is that
the near-death experience

82
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,900
comes from the cortex
returning to full function

83
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,969
after the body's gone
through a trauma.

84
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,572
Sometimes our neuroscience
escapes those of us

85
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,873
from the pharmaceutical
industry.

86
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,775
Is a bigfoot discovery
also imminent?

87
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,044
I thought we agreed to keep
the work involving your wife's

88
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:23,515
At least I know where to find
my wife-- at home, at night.

89
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,950
That's assuming you
left her inflated.

90
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,985
Gentlemen.

91
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:31,423
We will immediately review
your latest findings.

92
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,991
We need to get to that
scheduled luncheon

93
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,059
with the rest of the committee.

94
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,775
You appear as if you've
come up empty-handed,

95
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,977
then you feign a new
discovery and bite

96
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,112
one of the hands that
feeds the institution?

97
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,982
He obviously slipped through
the evolutionary sieve.

98
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,917
That's what I'm
talking about, Jack.

99
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,453
I mean, no one is expecting
blind ass-kissing.

100
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,089
ass-kissing isn't
the issue, Billy.

101
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,824
Everyone knows redfield
got on the board

102
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,161
And you can come up with
the millions necessary to run

103
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:13,064
Kowtowing to a special interest
portends a myopic approach

104
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,766
and a lack of respect
from our colleagues

105
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,871
At least create the appearance
of respectability, especially

106
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,941
when the work is questioned.

107
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,011
Ram is a neuroscience
graduate from Yale.

108
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,913
Medina is from the
rockefeller university.

109
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,048
Physics and mathematical
biology are her specialties.

110
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,150
Do you seriously think
they'd be wasting their time

111
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,652
with crackpot research?

112
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:34,920
Where are
you guys with this?

113
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,755
The evidence that Dr.
sutree has uncovered

114
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,457
is very compelling.

115
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,494
My colleagues were impressed
with the potential correlations

116
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,930
discovered here.

117
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,665
How close are
you and your team?

118
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,900
Could there be
something concrete

119
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,570
by the end of the quarter?

120
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,637
It's difficult to say.

121
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,139
I'm going to see what I can do.

122
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,106
But no more detours.

123
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,617
Here are the latest orns.

124
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,553
It confirms you're on
the right track regarding

125
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,222
odor discrimination.

126
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,122
Good.

127
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,658
I'll take it from here.

128
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,594
How late you staying, boss?

129
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,930
Just want to finish prepping
these detector compounds.

130
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,032
Tomorrow.

131
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,634
Thanks, ram.

132
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,204
Are you and Mrs. Jack
still on for dinner?

133
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,073
Of course.

134
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:32,811
I'm having a send-off for
sunny-girl tomorrow afternoon.

135
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,246
You can join me if you'd like.

136
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,514
I'm there.

137
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,151
I'm very saddened
with your loss, Jack.

138
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,220
Sunny-girl was very special.

139
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,824
She would certainly have been
honored by the Nepal hindus.

140
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,893
Don't worry, I'm not
going vicar on you.

141
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,029
There was something unique
between you and sunny-girl.

142
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,665
It was more than friendship.

143
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,134
I'd call that spiritual.

144
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,169
I'm sad.

145
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,237
But spiritual?

146
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,642
We are scientists.

147
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,610
We compare one thing
relative to another.

148
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,712
We connect to them in
a linear, rational way

149
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,014
that makes sense to our brains.

150
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,615
Could sunny-girl
speak words with you?

151
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,950
No.

152
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,085
Could she tell
when you were sad?

153
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,321
Yes.

154
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,323
She's gone now.

155
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:23,261
Where do you feel it more--
here or deep inside here?

156
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,864
There is a special kind of
intelligence inside here too.

157
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,100
It's a spiritual intelligence--
a spiritual energy.

158
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,872
It was more than friendship.

159
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:34,573
It was spiritual.

160
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,743
I appreciate the
kind thoughts, ram.

161
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,114
I'm bringing a
young lady friend

162
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,017
who caught my eye to dinner.

163
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,086
Let me know if you
think I have a chance.

164
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:18,917
What?

165
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,752
Ram, something's happening.

166
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,387
He didn't even see me come in.

167
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,924
He's been at it
for over an hour.

168
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,626
My gosh.

169
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,928
He's been here all night.

170
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,996
All night?

171
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,801
Making breakfast for everyone?

172
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,403
I think we got
something here, ram.

173
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,271
I plugged in the
discrimination factors,

174
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,041
and they seem to have taken
things to the next level.

175
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,944
Are we talking
practical or theoretical?

176
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,846
I'm saying the
cat's in the bag.

177
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,948
But it appears the
bag may be too small.

178
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,954
Ram.

179
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,022
Hit the lights.

180
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,273
Wow.

181
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,317
Medina!

182
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,690
Don't rub, don't rub.

183
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:33,992
You ok?

184
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:35,994
Say something, Jack.

185
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,095
Aah.

186
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,697
Just keep breathing.

187
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,202
Jack, doctor, say something.

188
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,204
Are you ok?

189
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,305
Ok.

190
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,006
Here you go.

191
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:48,440
Here you go.

192
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:49,074
Here you go.

193
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:49,774
Ugh!

194
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:50,909
Come on, this way.

195
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,810
This way.

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,880
I'm going to shut
down the experiment.

197
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,782
I'm going to check your eyes.

198
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,150
Lean back, please.

199
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,792
What?

200
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,394
How do you feel?

201
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,731
Like I was just shot
through the "2001" star gate.

202
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,733
Wow, my eyes felt like
they were on fire.

203
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,978
You were here all night, Jack.

204
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,248
Well, after you left, I plugged
in the orn data you gave me.

205
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,217
It fell right into place
with the theoretical values

206
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,519
When I saw that, i
didn't want to stop.

207
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,387
I needed to see if it
could actually work.

208
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,189
Did it?

209
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,924
I didn't get to test
all the wavelengths.

210
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:44,796
But so far, no.

211
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:45,897
Close but no cigar.

212
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,338
Thanks, both of you.

213
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,206
I know I can be a
taskmaster at times.

214
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,276
And I appreciate you going
with the change in direction.

215
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,446
We support your work, Jack.

216
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,316
The other things, well,
just have a bit more faith

217
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,384
in your staff.

218
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,293
Mhm.

219
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,262
You want some, Jack?

220
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,899
But try to keep sunny-girl's
ashes curry-free, will you?

221
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,201
Heh.

222
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,403
Your eyes-- is it the spices?

223
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,005
You know, they've never
affected me before.

224
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,810
Photophobia maybe?

225
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,012
I don't know.

226
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,046
Well, Jasmine is in bloom.

227
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,282
Maybe allergies.

228
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,216
Ram, roll down your window.

229
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,197
Jack, are you ok?

230
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,540
I feel a little dizzy.

231
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,118
Jack?

232
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,636
Jack, are you ok?

233
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:32,503
You ok, Jack?

234
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,198
Jack?

235
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,672
I saw it.

236
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,574
I saw it all.

237
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,277
What did you see?

238
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,412
The scent of the oranges.

239
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,613
The flowers' attractants.

240
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,614
The burnt hydrocarbons.

241
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,515
I could see it, ram.

242
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,549
It was all there.

243
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,651
What did you see?

244
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,519
Colors.

245
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:26,491
Even your curry in your
container and on your breath.

246
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,295
I could see the aromas swirling,
naturally flowing in the air.

247
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,630
You saw this without
the apparatus?

248
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,965
Are you sure?

249
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,567
Yes, yes, yes, of course.

250
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,171
The gases I mixed in the
lab must be some residue.

251
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,440
Why can you see this now?

252
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,708
I don't know.

253
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,684
You ever have a song
change your life?

254
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,053
There's one from a while back.

255
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,523
You might not be
familiar with it, ram.

256
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:02,060
My dad used to play
it all the time.

257
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:07,332
A song describing stardust
and billion-year-old carbon.

258
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:15,073
Those words connected
who we are here

259
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,579
And I wanted to
be a part of that.

260
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,014
That's why I went into science.

261
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,589
Now I'm about to scatter
this very special collection

262
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,491
of billion-year-old
carbon into the sea.

263
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,767
Bye, girl.

264
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,377
Ugh!

265
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,688
Let's get back to the lab.

266
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,196
The compounds must have gone
through some sort of change

267
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,264
when the gases distilled.

268
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,565
We can begin a full analysis.

269
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,167
Just prepare everything
in the morning

270
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,168
and wait till I get back.

271
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,205
Tomorrow morning.

272
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,074
Tomorrow morning.

273
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:27,111
I have to see my mom and-- oh,
damn, that freaking deposition.

274
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,279
Billy, great.

275
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,280
Whoa.

276
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,114
What--

277
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,049
oh, it's nothing.

278
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:31,816
There's been a breakthrough.

279
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,418
We have proof.

280
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,520
Scents, smells
can be visualized.

281
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,655
They can be seen without
any special instruments.

282
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,458
We're about to give every
institution researching

283
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,493
chemoreception a run
for its money, man.

284
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,796
Can you see them now?

285
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,634
But I could see them flowing
out like hundreds of fountains

286
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,703
Graham's law of effusion
seen with the naked eye.

287
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:56,274
It was uncanny,
illuminating, a radical shift

288
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,376
in our understanding
of the visual senses.

289
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,245
Imagine an app on a smart device
that you move over a patient,

290
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,614
and then it points you
in the right direction.

291
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,150
Well, I'm glad I took action.

292
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,785
What do you mean?

293
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,721
The regents-- they moved
to pull the funding.

294
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:11,789
Oh.

295
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,498
I came here to tell you there's
a separate fund I can tap.

296
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,699
It's used for emergencies.

297
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,802
It will allow you to
continue for a while.

298
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,504
A while?

299
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,605
Through next month.

300
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,741
Smear some testosterone
cream between your legs

301
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,311
Don't you realize
what we have here?

302
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,479
They're walking all over you!

303
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,651
It will have to
do for now, Jack.

304
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:44,555
And if what you're saying is
true, the funding will happen.

305
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,623
All we need is the proof.

306
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,231
Ram, let's keep
this quiet for now.

307
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,267
Even from Medina?

308
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,169
Yes.

309
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,370
I'll lock up.

310
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,138
See you at dinner.

311
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,238
Damn.

312
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,344
All right, there's got to
be a better way than this.

313
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,384
Oh, hey, ram.

314
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,685
Something came up.

315
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,920
Melanie can't make it.

316
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,255
Everything ok?

317
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,658
Well, we're working
some things out.

318
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,959
I've been staying
at my mom's house.

319
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,294
No, no, I meant your eyes.

320
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,395
You're rubbing them.

321
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,363
Is it the same
sensation as earlier?

322
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,199
Probably a latent effect.

323
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,234
Something came up with
my dinner date as well.

324
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:06,204
She brought a friend.

325
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,905
How long have you been with
the university, Dr. sutree?

326
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,986
Sorry.

327
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:26,691
And ram tells me that your lab
is involved with world health.

328
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,261
Yes, practically every
university research group

329
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,598
is trying to eradicate the
spread of malaria and dengue.

330
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,367
Studying the odors
our bodies give off

331
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,835
could be a way to help do that.

332
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,838
Mosquitoes seem to be
attracted to these odors.

333
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,740
Wouldn't improving
the infrastructure

334
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,344
so that cleanliness wasn't
an issue keep them away?

335
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:49,480
It's more
complicated than that.

336
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,483
Our bodies also
give off natural pheromones,

337
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,385
regardless of our cleanliness.

338
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:58,422
Sounds like there is more
to attraction than just

339
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:02,760
wearing aftershave or perfume.

340
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,662
Oh, I daresay pheromone
detection would even

341
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:07,265
be able to tell when
a woman is ovulating.

342
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:11,836
Dr. sutree, has your department
tapped into the data mining

343
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,972
modules that Brenda's
group has developed?

344
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,340
Not that I'm aware of.

345
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,743
John is an amazing programmer.

346
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,579
He's been assisting me on
the voice-pert project.

347
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:24,882
The goal is for workers
throughout the state health

348
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,686
care system to be able
to instantaneously search

349
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,722
any database via
voice recognition.

350
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,924
She's just
impressed because I'm

351
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,327
really sensitive to
semicolons and parentheses.

352
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,930
So John, will you be
staying and ordering

353
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,600
food or just having a drink?

354
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:43,801
Yeah.

355
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,071
I only ask because when i
invited Brenda to dinner,

356
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,473
I didn't know that an expert
in parentheses and semicolons

357
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,741
would be joining us.

358
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,344
Oh, I apologize, ram.

359
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,314
I just thought it would be good
for John to meet Dr. sutree.

360
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,481
We'll take care of our part.

361
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,616
No problem, dude.

362
00:21:58,618 --> 00:21:59,950
I can cover myself.

363
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,886
How about some oyster shooters?

364
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:05,523
We're doing studies on
parasites that cannot survive

365
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,059
without their host or hostess.

366
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,860
Cool.

367
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,896
Did I miss
something, Dr. sutree?

368
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,864
Oh, I was just
thinking, it's a bold man

369
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,800
who first ate an oyster.

370
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,702
Tell me about it.

371
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,837
Well, that was one of the
most interesting dinners

372
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,905
I've ever had.

373
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,742
Do you think I have a
chance with Brenda, Jack?

374
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,650
Ram, there's a
western expression

375
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,418
that associates
potential romance

376
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,921
with an ocean of sea life.

377
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,522
You may want to
swim yourself over

378
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,724
to a different
section of the sea.

379
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,195
This pair seems
a bit small, ma.

380
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,632
I've always been a size 7.

381
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,934
I guarantee you not
one part of my body

382
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,170
has grown with that
food they give me.

383
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,872
Grown with?

384
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,808
I thought you were
a proud grammarian.

385
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,843
Being chair-bound for a
year could have something

386
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,745
to do with it, don't you think?

387
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:15,813
Nonsense.

388
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:16,580
There we go.

389
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,852
If it feels too tight, i
don't want you wearing them,

390
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,821
no matter how good they look.

391
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:27,525
You sometimes have to
suffer for beauty, hon.

392
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:32,062
You're already beautiful, and
it wasn't from any suffering.

393
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,898
Your father wouldn't
have agreed with that.

394
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,605
I'll take them.

395
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,575
Ok.

396
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,143
One, two, three.

397
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,249
Are you comfortable, Katie?

398
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,251
I'm ok.

399
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:57,121
Nurse?

400
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,657
Why did the doctor add
these three new medications?

401
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:04,762
Your mother was complaining
she wasn't able to get to sleep.

402
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,230
Ma, how do you feel?

403
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,731
I'm tired.

404
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,236
Ask the doctor not to be so
liberal with the medication.

405
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:20,110
Shoe shopping is exhausting,
even for a young person.

406
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21,679
I got to go now, ma.

407
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,214
I'm heading downtown.

408
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:27,151
A new one?

409
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:31,288
I finished it in art
class a few days ago.

410
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,024
Beautiful.

411
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,326
I love you.

412
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,594
Rest.

413
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,262
Do you know him, Mr. sutree?

414
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:13,931
I thought I did, but no.

415
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,801
Why are you taking his picture?

416
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,770
How does he look to you?

417
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:22,172
He wasn't doing
well last evening.

418
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:25,309
But he's stable now.

419
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,977
You ok?

420
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,112
I'm late for a meeting.

421
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,852
Dr.
sutree has arrived.

422
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:37,821
Thank you.

423
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,957
My apologies for the delay.

424
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,893
Just be seated, Dr.
sutree, and we'll begin.

425
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:45,329
We appreciate you agreeing
to be an expert witness.

426
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,965
Sure.

427
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,401
Could I have some water, please?

428
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,970
This is the videotaped
deposition of John Benjamin

429
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:55,706
sutree taken by counsel for
the plaintiff in the matter

430
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:59,009
of "karin honeygrove versus
bioren pharmaceuticals,"

431
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,712
held in the offices of tromo,
gatelitt, Roberts located

432
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:04,815
at 304 Broadway, los
Angeles, California.

433
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,984
If counsel would now please
state their appearances

434
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:09,219
starting with the party
noticing this deposition.

435
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,221
Marsha tweed,
representing the plaintiff.

436
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,991
Van tromo, representing
bioren pharmaceuticals.

437
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,793
Please state your
full legal name.

438
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,194
And John Benjamin sutree.

439
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,930
And Mr. sutree, what is
your present home address?

440
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:23,100
815 garden road-- sorry.

441
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,937
1956 victory Lane, Los Angeles.

442
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,138
How long have you lived there?

443
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,009
Um, two months.

444
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,477
Please raise
your right hand.

445
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,346
Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you will give here

446
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,916
in this deposition proceeding
be the truth, the whole truth,

447
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,017
and nothing but the truth?

448
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,218
I do.

449
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,153
Are you here today
under subpoena, sir?

450
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,888
Yes, I am.

451
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,457
Let's start with your
medical background.

452
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,292
Are you a medical doctor?

453
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,360
No, I'm a doctor of science.

454
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,830
I have a phd in biological
sciences from Stanford.

455
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,364
Any other degrees?

456
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,167
A bachelor's in
physics and a master's

457
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,270
in medical biochemistry from
the university of Chicago.

458
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,506
Doctor, what is your
current occupation?

459
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,742
I'm employed as the head
of olfactory research

460
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:08,512
Did you attend the meeting
at bioren pharmaceuticals

461
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,482
December 17, 2010?

462
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:14,451
I did attend the meeting,
but I'm not sure of the date.

463
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,988
Why did you attend the meeting?

464
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,258
Specifically to do a detailed
analysis of the ingredients

465
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,894
for a new aerosol spray that
permitted the user to inhale

466
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:26,864
rather than digest vitamins.

467
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:29,066
We were there to present
our take on the ingredients.

468
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,834
At this meeting at
bioren, sir, was there

469
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,070
discussion as to any possible
ill effects from the vitamin

470
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,272
spray?

471
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,241
That meeting encompassed
a number of findings,

472
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:40,811
but none that I recall
discussed noxae gradients.

473
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:43,480
Spell that please.

474
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:47,518
N-o-x-a-e.

475
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,853
And does that mean?

476
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,155
It's the plural of noxious.

477
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:52,856
It refers to a
poisonous substance.

478
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,458
I object.

479
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,093
We're beginning to
get into what sounds

480
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,795
like protected materials.

481
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,296
I'm instructing
you not to answer,

482
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,465
as this information
violates a confidentiality

483
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,167
agreement with bioren.

484
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,203
I further object under paragraph
9 of the case management order.

485
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,105
On the contrary,
he must answer.

486
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,973
You are required to
answer the questions, sir.

487
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,475
Just a moment.

488
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,243
Maybe it's time we make a
phone call to judge renfrew

489
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,312
to discuss the terms of
the case management order.

490
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,948
This entire line of
inquiry is in violation

491
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,884
of a confidentiality agreement
and may violate the case

492
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,854
Sir, I don't know of anything
in the previous order that

493
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,155
permits you to call
judge renfrew when we're

494
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,457
It's not fair to the witness.

495
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,027
He hasn't finished his answer.

496
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,396
Please complete your answer
about the noxae ingredients.

497
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,398
I'd like to call an
end of this for today.

498
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,033
I told you, from
what we analyzed,

499
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:38,335
If you wish to draw
other conclusions,

500
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,469
get them from someone else.

501
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,404
But you
can't just leave.

502
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,839
You're here under a subpoena.

503
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:44,875
I'm assuming you
people have put in the time

504
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:47,978
to study the analyses, the
results we all gathered.

505
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,513
If you haven't,
you're all fools.

506
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,015
I could get the research and
read it off to you if you like.

507
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,083
Pretty exciting stuff.

508
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,952
Was that a yes or no?

509
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,223
It's a fuck you.

510
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:32,189
Get yo'
ass outta here!

511
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,257
What you care?

512
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,192
Leave
him be, stalagmite!

513
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,361
Yo, go somewhere else and do
some throw-ups or something.

514
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,196
I'll get remey to
whoop your ass.

515
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,197
Sheeit.

516
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,999
Busta lickin' punk!

517
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:42,532
Bitch!

518
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,678
You all right, mister.

519
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,417
Holy shit.

520
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,122
You come running out that
building swatting the fuzzy

521
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,990
or something like that.

522
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,392
You're kidding.

523
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:12,129
All I remember is i
was on my feet running.

524
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:15,399
Now I got this pain in my head.

525
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,602
Starts in your
feet then goes to your head.

526
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,104
Just 'cause you feel it
means your roots aren't dead.

527
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,007
La da Dee, la da da.

528
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:28,545
La da Dee, la da da.

529
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,480
Hey, don't worry.

530
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,115
Nothing's missing.

531
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,183
I made sure.

532
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,059
Please.

533
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,534
Please.

534
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,707
What?

535
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,375
You in love?

536
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,115
My name's Jack.

537
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,720
Bazemint.

538
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:11,688
Bazemint tape.

539
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,557
Yeah, what about it?

540
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,191
No, no.

541
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,692
Nothing.

542
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,095
A musician, right?

543
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:20,197
Better believe it.

544
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:23,633
Well, I want to thank
you for watching over me.

545
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,635
I got to go back to work now.

546
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,104
How'd you know?

547
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,171
What?

548
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,640
I was into music?

549
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,475
Easy-- your name.

550
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,116
You going to be
able to keep it real?

551
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:40,317
Yeah.

552
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,519
I just lost myself
a little earlier.

553
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,554
Not normal for me.

554
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,057
Yeah, I know what that's like.

555
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,393
But you know what?

556
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:53,096
There is nothing stranger
than a normal person.

557
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,468
Thank you again, bazemint.

558
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,604
You're very kind.

559
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,639
Just don't be normal.

560
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,796
Jack, what happened?

561
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,732
What are you doing?

562
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,201
Measuring quantities
from the experiment.

563
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:34,204
I thought I made it clear to
let things be until I returned.

564
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,239
Dr. bleu instructed me
to organize our work.

565
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,841
But look what I found.

566
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,243
Based on the quantities that we
started with and what was left,

567
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,813
60 milliliters were expended.

568
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:45,082
So it didn't take
much to have an effect.

569
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,850
How much is left?

570
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:49,453
2.82 liters.

571
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:52,489
That's 92 more applications.

572
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:55,258
The effect diminishes
with time, ram.

573
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,726
We need to make more.

574
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,395
Everything's documented,
so it shouldn't

575
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,464
be a problem to formulate.

576
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,499
What's bleu want
with the information?

577
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,567
He didn't say.

578
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,641
If your eyesight
was any better,

579
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:14,578
you'd be able to
see through people.

580
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,313
What's that supposed to mean?

581
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:17,414
Your vision's fine, Jack.

582
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,416
Why so testy?

583
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,418
I'm sorry, Hugo.

584
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,419
Everything's hitting at once.

585
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,421
What's new in your department?

586
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:27,257
We have a few clinical trials
going on for redfield's group.

587
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,759
One's on lowering
blood glucose levels

588
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:34,131
with prednisolone acetate,
eye drops for diabetics.

589
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:37,234
Is there no escaping the wake
of his pharmaceutical swill?

590
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,802
I don't follow.

591
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,138
He's smothering the firewall
between research and commerce.

592
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,141
Ah, it's the times we're in,
Jack, with funding and all.

593
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,376
He's got programs throughout
the county health system,

594
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:49,679
in the prison system, even
at the state hospital.

595
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:50,747
Teargarden?

596
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,152
Limited liability risk.

597
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,320
Testing new drugs on the insane.

598
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,156
I didn't say that was going on.

599
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,891
Oh, you don't have to.

600
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:01,791
It's the redfield way.

601
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,296
Thanks, Hugo.

602
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,409
Jack.

603
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,810
Here, I can't seem to open this.

604
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,380
Come in.

605
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,814
Surprised I'm here, right?

606
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,183
In a church nave, yes.

607
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,251
In my home, not at all.

608
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,687
Well, I appreciate you getting
together on such short notice.

609
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,756
You know, back in my
teens, I experienced

610
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,724
one of the best
flavor sensations ever

611
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:40,297
It started with a short crunch
followed by sweetness and then

612
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,699
a zap of slight burning.

613
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,869
And when the combination
moved further into the mouth,

614
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,272
oh, it was like a wave
of flavor breaking

615
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,540
on the back of my tongue.

616
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:54,511
And now, decades later, I plan
to recapture that experience.

617
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,413
French, vietnamese, Italian?

618
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:59,449
You know, where the onion
doesn't get lost in the ring

619
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,317
but still doesn't overpower it.

620
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,885
I think they're ready.

621
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,954
Right.

622
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:08,692
Now, you and I are
going to experience

623
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:12,529
a little bit of heaven
on this beautiful earth.

624
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,263
There.

625
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,834
Your meals always
give faith a good name.

626
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:25,542
I can't for the
life of me explain.

627
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:28,445
There was a lab accident
that affected my eyes.

628
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,779
Your eyesight ok?

629
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:34,684
I don't know how to tell
you with a straight face.

630
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,787
I'm seeing things.

631
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:40,290
While I'm awake,
in broad daylight.

632
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,925
You're serious?

633
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,361
I'm dead serious.

634
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,297
My dog just passed away.

635
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:51,401
But after the lab
accident, I saw her.

636
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:57,774
She was there, so vivid in the
room, so real it hurt my heart.

637
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,810
I was visiting my mother
in her nursing home.

638
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:04,314
When I left, I saw an
elderly man in another room.

639
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:07,751
Floating above him, I saw a
younger version of that man.

640
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,053
I was just at a
deposition today.

641
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:13,490
Sitting opposite me was an
executive I've never met.

642
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:16,660
Then a separate lurid
vision of him appears.

643
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:20,297
Maybe you have an explanation.

644
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,399
Or am I losing it?

645
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:23,900
Oh, I know you.

646
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:29,873
But to see something, you
have to believe in it, right?

647
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,875
I look over there, and i
see an onion, because I

648
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,710
believe it's an onion.

649
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:37,013
I don't believe in
magic or pious spirits.

650
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,748
Why the visions?

651
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,517
Maybe you need to
approach this phenomenon

652
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,453
in a different manner.

653
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,921
The onion, please.

654
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,090
Go ahead.

655
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:50,493
Now, forget that you know it's
a bulbous, yellowish, brown

656
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,062
vegetable, ok?

657
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:55,031
Try to meet it on its own terms.

658
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,766
It's a sphere, right?

659
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,769
Well, look closely.

660
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,072
Look at the bottom
and follow it up.

661
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,641
It's not really a sphere.

662
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,444
As a man of science
you might see

663
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:12,649
that it's actually a bloom of
linear vectors pushing upwards.

664
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:14,718
Now, peel off the outside layer.

665
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,785
Go ahead.

666
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,958
Notice how it's dry.

667
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,127
But how dry?

668
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:29,366
It's not of powdered dry or an
old crusty dry that crumbles.

669
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,469
No, it's a fresh type of dry.

670
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,505
In fact, compared to other
dry things in this world,

671
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:39,909
you could say its dryness
is actually exquisite.

672
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,811
Now, here.

673
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,113
Slice it open.

674
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,381
Go on.

675
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,887
Ah, look at that.

676
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,456
You've opened the
floodgates of being.

677
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,126
Life inside of death.

678
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:58,428
Now, how do we know it's alive?

679
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,398
Try to put the two
halves back together.

680
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,066
You can't.

681
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,436
The pieces of its being
were held under compression,

682
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:09,139
as are all living things.

683
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,941
Now, notice we can't
escape the aroma that

684
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,612
fills the air released
from its flowing juices.

685
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,981
Just seconds ago, there
was very little smell.

686
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:20,583
It was contained in
that exquisite dryness,

687
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,920
if you remember.

688
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,556
Shit, I'll never look at
an onion the same way again.

689
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:29,526
When you see one
of those visions,

690
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:32,796
forget any previous associations
that may come into your mind.

691
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:35,598
Focus your consciousness deeply.

692
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,067
Forget what you don't believe.

693
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,136
Look at what it means to you.

694
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,740
You're all fools.

695
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,975
I can get the research and read
it off to you, if you like.

696
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:50,580
Because if you
want me to, I will.

697
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:53,783
Was
that a yes or no?

698
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,852
It's a fuck you.

699
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,787
Jury profiling begins tomorrow.

700
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,623
Jury selection is
around the corner.

701
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,526
And you, our expert
witness, leave

702
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:08,698
a deposition that could lead
to us losing the entire case.

703
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,135
Listen, I'm exhausted.

704
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,938
The pressure to produce results
has become almost unbearable.

705
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,973
But I just can't stress
enough the importance

706
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,042
of what we've stumbled
onto, especially

707
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:21,845
now, because it's
taken a new twist.

708
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:23,513
What are you
talking about, Jack?

709
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,849
The vision enhancements
have deviated away

710
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:26,683
from odor signatures.

711
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,022
What are you talking about?

712
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:35,825
Personality traits.

713
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,095
Scientific results are
governed by perception.

714
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,130
You know this better than
anyone here, Clayton.

715
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,867
A drug is developed
to relieve chest pain.

716
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,837
But someone looked at
that failure differently.

717
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,806
It turns out it inhibits
an enzyme allowing blood

718
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,207
to flow to the penis.

719
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,811
It becomes the most
successful drug in history.

720
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:57,280
Well, what we discovered
in the lab, the ability

721
00:41:57,282 --> 00:42:00,750
to see the aromas a
substance gives off,

722
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:02,986
has shifted to
the ability to see

723
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:06,523
what an individual emanates.

724
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:10,827
You know how we describe someone
like, he beams confidence,

725
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,162
or, she has a glow about her?

726
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,532
There's now a way that
can actually be seen.

727
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,901
It can be physically observed
and described in detail.

728
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,938
Jack.

729
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:29,112
This is a university
biomedical research department.

730
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:32,282
We have 24 faculty emeriti
who conduct ongoing research

731
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:35,652
into cancer, infectious
diseases, physics,

732
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:38,888
often in collaboration with
the heads of laboratories

733
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,558
and hospitals around the world.

734
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,794
They all stay in high esteem,
because they back up their work

735
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:45,962
with confirmed experiment.

736
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:50,700
You yourself-- you
yourself-- loudly

737
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,269
proclaim that magical
thinking can't solve problems.

738
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,873
But you continue to
make outrageous claims.

739
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,741
The perception is that
the university's money

740
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,177
and resources are being wasted.

741
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,880
I think this has
gotten out of hand.

742
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,882
You're right.

743
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,084
What I've experienced
has to be formalized.

744
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,753
I just wish you could
see it for yourself.

745
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,958
Redfield, what's the most
important part of a court

746
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,362
It's happening within
days-- jury selection.

747
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:22,665
Clayton, what do you want
done with this project?

748
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:23,900
Give me some additional time.

749
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:26,836
That is no longer an option.

750
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,805
Your dependability has
come into question.

751
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:31,741
Can you give the baronial
attitude a rest and listen?

752
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,643
Just one day.

753
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,311
If I can't show you
something convincing

754
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,213
by the end of tomorrow,
I'll do whatever you want.

755
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:39,315
Give it to someone
else to continue.

756
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,383
Anything.

757
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:43,252
Come on, Clayton.

758
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,659
24 hours.

759
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,732
Do you see this button here?

760
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:59,068
When you push it, it will
be similar to the burst

761
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,771
of air you get when an
optometrist tests for glaucoma.

762
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:02,872
Clever Medina.

763
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,674
Now there won't be any waste.

764
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:06,009
Thanks to Dr. machado.

765
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:07,844
Do I have enough for
three or four applications?

766
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:09,245
Easily.

767
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:12,048
Ram added the solution to
this small capsule here.

768
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,083
Be sure everything is recorded.

769
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,119
Got it.

770
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:19,789
This enhancement in your
vision you described--

771
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,857
why the sudden change?

772
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,291
Did something happen at home?

773
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,199
It's strange, ram.

774
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,367
I was working.

775
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,702
I dozed off.

776
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,771
I woke up.

777
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,172
Then I saw sunny-girl.

778
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,240
Sunny-girl?

779
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,010
Perhaps there is an
additional factor

780
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,113
we are not considering--
the mix of our emotions

781
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:48,818
We work in the representational
world defined by formulas.

782
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,220
Yes, emotions can be an
obstacle to rational thought.

783
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:53,222
But we also know
extreme emotional grief

784
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:55,091
affects every part of the body.

785
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:59,429
Stress can alter
the body chemistry.

786
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:02,065
You're getting at what happens
with something like serotonin.

787
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:04,000
Serious bereavement can
cause serotonin levels

788
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:07,737
Hallucinations are associated
with neurotransmitter

789
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,405
disturbances.

790
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,941
Not a hallucination.

791
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:14,010
The brain is more than
electrical and chemical

792
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:17,880
reactions operating
in a chunk of meat.

793
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,248
Consciousness is also in there.

794
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,285
And this combination helped
to alter your perception

795
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:26,489
from enhanced
observations-- fragrances--

796
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:31,294
to informed visions.

797
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:36,365
Objective, persistent,
and timeless-- those

798
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,468
are the principles any
phenomenon needs to be held to.

799
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,871
If your theory holds
up with those in mind,

800
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,973
I'm willing to pass through
any doors of perception

801
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,475
you're attempting to open.

802
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:47,210
Yes, Jack.

803
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:51,114
But we must also remember the
lesson that you taught us.

804
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,382
Honor the elders,
embrace the new,

805
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:56,319
and applaud the impracticable.

806
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:57,787
Let's keep thinking about it.

807
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,856
I've got to go.

808
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,089
Hi.

809
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:36,926
I work with Dr. redfield in
the university biosciences

810
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:37,560
department.

811
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:38,294
Trixie tao.

812
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,096
A pleasure.

813
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,464
Is Dr. redfield attending today?

814
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,999
No.

815
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:45,134
I'm here to observe
the jury profiling.

816
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,469
Why is that?

817
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,504
I'm going to note any
characteristics that

818
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:50,106
may not be obvious to others.

819
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:53,409
Hopefully it will provide
some help for your process.

820
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:56,145
I assure you we don't need
any assistance in what we do.

821
00:46:56,147 --> 00:47:01,851
It's sort of research for a
new approach Dr. redfield wants

822
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:03,319
to explore.

823
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,221
Do you have a way
different from ours

824
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:07,056
to predict whether or not
a prospective juror may

825
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,025
be dangerous to a case?

826
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:11,928
Because we already cover
life experiences, predisposed

827
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,563
attitudes, and believes.

828
00:47:13,565 --> 00:47:16,499
We go below the surface.

829
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,000
Let's just say our
approach focuses

830
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:21,070
on what's behind the person.

831
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,940
Is there an area where
I'll be out of the way?

832
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:25,174
Through that door.

833
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,143
There's a small room
with a one-way glass.

834
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,444
You'll have all the
privacy you need.

835
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,279
Thanks Ms. tao.

836
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,981
Here.

837
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,983
These are the
evaluation guidelines

838
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:37,053
that our social scientists have
developed for each candidate.

839
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,487
I'll make notes for each one.

840
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:42,225
Knock yourself out.

841
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:46,195
So as I was saying--

842
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,220
what do you feel is
important about having laws?

843
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,588
Everyone knows laws
were established

844
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,057
for people's own good.

845
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,927
It's dangerous when
laws are not obeyed.

846
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,296
Is there ever a time when
the law should not be obeyed?

847
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:25,635
If people don't obey the law,
we would have total chaos.

848
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:27,904
Whoa.

849
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:39,115
Someone implies something
about you that is not true.

850
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:40,583
How does that affect you?

851
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:41,951
It doesn't.

852
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:44,520
It doesn't affect me at all.

853
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,657
We can't help it if someone
gets the wrong idea about us.

854
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,258
Hmm.

855
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,960
Can we help it if someone
says something about us

856
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:54,363
that isn't true?

857
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,466
Which us president
do you admire most?

858
00:48:57,468 --> 00:49:01,070
Why, our current president.

859
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:01,938
Oh, really?

860
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:12,048
Have you ever worked as a
janitor, been a business owner,

861
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,416
or worked in a hospital?

862
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:17,486
In college, I worked
part time as a janitor.

863
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:20,022
Well, that's refreshing.

864
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:22,024
Do you play the lottery?

865
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:23,426
That's one vice
that I don't have.

866
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,396
You sure about that?

867
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,370
Do you feel drugs
should be legalized?

868
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:35,204
They already are.

869
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,110
What do you expect
when, as you're

870
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:42,511
approaching a parking
spot, another car

871
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:44,213
races by and takes it?

872
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,455
The driver is in
the wrong to do that.

873
00:49:52,457 --> 00:49:55,591
And it makes me angry.

874
00:49:59,129 --> 00:49:59,996
Thank you.

875
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:03,132
Candidate 14, please.

876
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,503
What was the name of
the last book you read?

877
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:18,748
"Four past midnight."

878
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,519
Thank you.

879
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,390
Roger?

880
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:28,024
Roger.

881
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,493
Call 911.

882
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,579
What happened?

883
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:53,482
You passed out and were
rushed to the hospital.

884
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:56,152
No.

885
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:59,221
What happened to us?

886
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,756
Your walking shoes.

887
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:03,359
For a moment, I thought
we were back in Paris.

888
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:05,227
Rest, Jack.

889
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,730
You're still out there.

890
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:11,634
Could you close
that cabinet drawer?

891
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:14,703
Now you're back.

892
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,105
Mm.

893
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:17,106
I'm serious, Mel.

894
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:18,441
What happened to us?

895
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:24,480
Answers would be nice.

896
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:32,555
I'm just busy doing other
things now, just like you.

897
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,226
Hi, I'm Jim erlandson.

898
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:37,860
Mrs. sutree?

899
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:39,228
Yes.

900
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,529
Mr.
sutree, I understand

901
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,231
you were at a jury
selection procedure.

902
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,467
Why were you there?

903
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46,268
I'm an expert
witness in a case.

904
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,737
Was there any stress
or trauma that occurred

905
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,772
during the process?

906
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,107
None, no.

907
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:52,541
What about at work?

908
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:55,711
Would you say the stress
level there is above normal?

909
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,413
Where you going
with this, doctor?

910
00:51:57,415 --> 00:51:59,648
I'm a boring research
scientist at cu.

911
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,184
You appear to be a
normally healthy individual.

912
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:06,755
But your cortisol--
18, no more than 23

913
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,658
micrograms per deciliter is ok.

914
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,794
You came in here at over 50.

915
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,562
What is it now?

916
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:14,330
It's ok.

917
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:17,366
It's just if it had stayed
that high, it would have

918
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:19,368
started attacking your brain.

919
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,704
Eventually you would have
gone into cardiac shock.

920
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:29,245
Look, does your work expose
you to drugs or stimulants?

921
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:30,246
Cut the crap.

922
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:31,447
We don't abuse our privileges.

923
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,681
Jack.

924
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,550
Ok.

925
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:37,753
You need to review your
last few days for anything

926
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:40,322
unusual, anything
you reacted to,

927
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,859
anything that caused
emotional distress.

928
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,562
Because if what happened
today happens again,

929
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:49,665
your wife is going to
visit you on a slab.

930
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,267
He came in
like Dr. Jekyll.

931
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,168
But wouldn't you know?

932
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,469
He's Mr. Hyde.

933
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:55,538
Could you hand me my phone?

934
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,945
What happened today?

935
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,548
I've stumbled onto
something, Mel.

936
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:11,420
But it seems to be something
that will make some noise

937
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,656
and change things.

938
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:15,958
You are lying in a hospital
bed with your vital signs

939
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,893
Haven't things changed enough?

940
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:18,928
He said I'm fine.

941
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:19,895
What's on the other side?

942
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,568
I'm not chasing
the cat this time.

943
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,303
Your work is removed
from real life.

944
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:38,314
And I know what happened to us.

945
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:40,349
Your work removed you
from our marriage.

946
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,251
Dr. sutree?

947
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,320
Hold on, ram.

948
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,623
Why do you do it?

949
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,928
I guess for the same reasons
you and I walk together

950
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,264
along the left bank.

951
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:56,232
It's exciting.

952
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,669
And it makes me happy.

953
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,808
Sorry, ram.

954
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:09,812
Sutree showed up during
jury profiling yesterday.

955
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:10,713
Why?

956
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:14,650
He became sick and
was hospitalized.

957
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:15,351
What?

958
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:15,884
What happened?

959
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:17,386
Oh, he's discharged.

960
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,626
We should think
about shifting gears.

961
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,561
He has good predocs
working with him.

962
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,695
We should put them
to better use.

963
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,018
There's a decline effect, ram.

964
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,619
How do you mean?

965
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,755
I lost the ability to
see into people yesterday.

966
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:54,290
Even after repeated
applications,

967
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,458
the effect never came back.

968
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,594
And I've run out of time.

969
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:01,864
Any idea what
might have changed?

970
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:04,767
The effect first
happened within an hour,

971
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:07,002
when we were driving.

972
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,938
It came back later that
evening at the restaurant.

973
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,807
And then when I went home,
i experienced it again.

974
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,709
No, it went away at that point.

975
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:15,377
I could no longer see aromas.

976
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:18,847
The condition progressed
to the visions.

977
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:22,885
I still think it's related to
one subjective consciousness.

978
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:25,621
Emotion was part of it.

979
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:29,458
The first vision was sunny-girl.

980
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,560
But the man at the
nursing home, the lawyer,

981
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,395
the deposition, the
jury pool-- none of them

982
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:34,363
meant anything to me.

983
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:34,997
No, no, Jack.

984
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,365
The trigger.

985
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:37,966
I'm talking about
a triggering agent.

986
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,569
It sets things in motion.

987
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,839
You were so distressed when we
scattered sunny-girl's ashes.

988
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,714
Sunny-girl.

989
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:54,650
Ram, sunny-girl.

990
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:55,651
Billion-year-old carbon.

991
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,556
The song?

992
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,794
Hey, you tell your students
that using your formula app

993
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:06,695
is cheating.

994
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,664
It's my app.

995
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:09,965
Sweet app.

996
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:11,834
The most important
element in life.

997
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,702
The thing that ties
everything together.

998
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,904
It was added when her
ashes flew into my eyes.

999
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:18,073
After a few hours, it
altered the effect.

1000
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:18,941
Bazinga!

1001
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,509
Ashes!

1002
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:21,777
Activated carbon.

1003
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:23,078
A purifying agent.

1004
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,681
I'll wager my life it's
the triggering agent.

1005
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:27,483
Billion-year-old carbon!

1006
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:28,550
Yes!

1007
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,591
Careful.

1008
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,659
It's super-- get it
all on the plastic.

1009
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,831
Go ahead.

1010
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,802
Ok.

1011
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,792
Ok, here we go.

1012
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,169
Are you ok?

1013
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:22,104
Wow.

1014
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:22,838
It feels robust.

1015
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,489
Damn.

1016
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:42,458
Too many variables are at work.

1017
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,561
We need a subject to
properly document this,

1018
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,897
or it remains a theorem
without any proof.

1019
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:51,066
The psychology department
has the biggest research pool.

1020
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:52,734
Do you want me to get
someone from there?

1021
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,142
No.

1022
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:01,677
I have someone in mind.

1023
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,685
I'll be back.

1024
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,108
Listen, mister.

1025
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,744
I don't turn tricks, if that's
why you wanted to meet me.

1026
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:10,879
No, no, nothing like that.

1027
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,781
I'm from cu.

1028
00:59:12,783 --> 00:59:14,283
Speak English.

1029
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:16,652
The university down the road.

1030
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:19,254
You a teacher?

1031
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,189
More of a scientist.

1032
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,157
Bioscience.

1033
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,760
I study ways to improve life.

1034
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:26,028
Look around here.

1035
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,930
You got your work cut
out for you, playa.

1036
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:38,173
Those supposed to mean you cool?

1037
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,242
What, these?

1038
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,646
You may be a
professor, but you in

1039
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,049
need of some serious
streetcreducation.

1040
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,217
Do you remember when you
helped me the other day?

1041
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:52,321
Yeah, when you was running
like a mad scientist?

1042
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:54,289
Very good, yes.

1043
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:58,927
Well, you struck me as a
possible subject for our study.

1044
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,229
You want to study bazemint?

1045
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:03,231
What for?

1046
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,299
I'll be honest.

1047
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,168
I don't know.

1048
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:11,073
But when we first
met, I saw potential.

1049
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:14,009
And I think there's
value in pursuing that.

1050
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:17,312
Are you sure you're
not trying to mingle me?

1051
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:18,814
Mingle you?

1052
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:22,050
Yeah, because I don't do that.

1053
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,389
Anymore.

1054
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:30,192
Look, I'm not planning
any tricks here.

1055
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:34,296
I assure you my intentions
are strictly scientific.

1056
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,030
And the cheese?

1057
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,804
I can get you a couple
hundred dollars for your time.

1058
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:51,013
What you looking
for, professor Jack?

1059
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:53,382
That, bazemint,
is precisely what I

1060
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:54,750
hope you can help me find out.

1061
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,291
This gonna be on YouTube?

1062
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:05,661
Scientific experiment or
cat video-- I wonder which

1063
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,330
will get more hits.

1064
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,231
Y'all got al-Gore-rhythms?

1065
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,203
Algorithms?

1066
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:16,905
Yes, we use them.

1067
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:18,907
That shit really
gone change the world?

1068
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:22,711
They already have, for sure.

1069
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:24,680
What's your name again?

1070
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:25,781
Ram.

1071
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:27,983
You named after a goat?

1072
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:29,251
My full name is ramble.

1073
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:32,020
You named after a
goat taking a stroll?

1074
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,789
My father's name
is penku tambel.

1075
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:36,758
So he named me after
his favorite song,

1076
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,327
"ramble tamble," except mine
is spelled with an e-l, not

1077
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:39,995
an l-e.

1078
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:41,363
Jeez Louise.

1079
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,265
Sorry I asked.

1080
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:46,468
We're all set, Jack.

1081
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:49,004
You ready?

1082
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:50,439
What I'm supposed to do?

1083
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:51,973
Just relax.

1084
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:50,298
You all right?

1085
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,402
I don't know what
it is about you.

1086
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,071
Yeah, I get that a lot.

1087
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,343
How does it look, ram?

1088
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:03,278
There is a lot here, Jack.

1089
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,281
The good news-- your
heart rate stayed normal.

1090
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,550
You were never at risk.

1091
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:10,085
Are you all right?

1092
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:11,086
Yeah.

1093
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,989
Was that ok?

1094
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:17,159
Why did you hold my shoulder?

1095
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:19,427
You looked like
you needed help.

1096
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,799
Did I screw up already?

1097
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:24,933
No.

1098
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:26,568
No, you were fine.

1099
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:29,204
We've had a good start.

1100
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:32,107
I need to study what we
did here before we do more.

1101
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:34,442
Can I call upon
you in another day

1102
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:37,045
or so to do another session?

1103
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,113
Ok.

1104
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:45,453
But I need something else.

1105
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,009
Well, my funds are limited.

1106
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,144
Don't trip off that.

1107
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,580
I don't want more cheese.

1108
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:16,084
I want you to find
someone for me.

1109
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:19,154
Find someone?

1110
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:21,623
That's not what we do.

1111
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,925
But you full of
science swag here.

1112
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:28,597
You got some serious,
ginormous science swag.

1113
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:31,199
We wouldn't be the best
people to help locate someone.

1114
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,335
I don't even know
where to begin.

1115
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:34,936
You a scientist?

1116
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:36,438
Yes.

1117
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,541
You a scientist,
in a big-ass school.

1118
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:42,010
And you got
al-Gore-rhythms, right?

1119
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,945
Algorithms, correct.

1120
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:45,113
Listen.

1121
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,248
You got computers.

1122
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:49,918
No one else has ever cared
to help me with this.

1123
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,988
There are missing persons
organizations that can help.

1124
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:55,090
Don't you think i
seen them already?

1125
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:56,224
They couldn't do nothing.

1126
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,194
It's different if
you give it a try.

1127
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:01,897
Look, you says you
want to improve life.

1128
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:04,032
Start with me.

1129
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,367
Start with this life.

1130
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,377
I can't promise we'll
succeed, but I tell you what.

1131
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:18,046
We'll give it a shot.

1132
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:20,148
Who do you want to find?

1133
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:23,985
Well, it's hard to
talk about, because it

1134
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:25,253
ain't no one's business.

1135
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,121
It's your mother.

1136
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:36,164
How did you know i-- I want
to know where's my mama?

1137
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:37,532
Is she still in the area?

1138
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:38,333
Did she move away?

1139
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,639
It's been so long.

1140
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:49,477
And she was always sick.

1141
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,515
But I think she's around here.

1142
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,420
Can you help me find her?

1143
01:05:58,422 --> 01:05:59,321
We'll try.

1144
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,692
Thank you.

1145
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,529
Professor Jack, when
you were staring at me,

1146
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,397
what did you see?

1147
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:13,535
I still need more time
to understand things.

1148
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:19,541
But I can tell you this.

1149
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:22,077
Don't ever deny yourself and
your ability to do things,

1150
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,713
bazemint.

1151
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:27,215
You know your
friend from dinner?

1152
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:28,316
Brenda?

1153
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,219
She's working with the
county health administration.

1154
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:33,121
Ask if she can check
if bazemint's mom ever

1155
01:06:33,123 --> 01:06:35,991
turned up in the system.

1156
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:36,992
What is her name?

1157
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,060
Nina.

1158
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:40,662
Nina Orleans.

1159
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:44,466
And what name did
your mother give you?

1160
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:46,668
Simone.

1161
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,603
Simone.

1162
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,543
Redfield.

1163
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:57,345
Dr.
redfield, it's trixie tao.

1164
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,713
We had enhanced
background checks done

1165
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,181
on all the prospective jurors.

1166
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:01,616
It's unbelievable.

1167
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,251
What's unbelivable?

1168
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:04,652
I'd understand

1169
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:06,554
if he was correct about
two, maybe three, people.

1170
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:10,258
But he was spot on with
every single person.

1171
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,193
We've never seen that before.

1172
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,328
Details, Ms. tao.

1173
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,597
Who is he?

1174
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,665
Your
colleague, Dr. sutree.

1175
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,567
He flagged several of
the potential jurors

1176
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,803
as not trustworthy
before he became ill.

1177
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:23,805
They all had passed the
initial standard screening

1178
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:25,540
that was done.

1179
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,509
But when we went back and fed
the info into our new security

1180
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:30,412
tap, six of the individuals
had enough in their backgrounds

1181
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:32,347
to make them ineligible.

1182
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:34,115
I just sent the results to you.

1183
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:35,250
By the way, how is he?

1184
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:36,718
I need to contact him.

1185
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,787
Do you know what this means
for any challenge that

1186
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:40,121
ends up in front of a jury?

1187
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:41,089
Yeah, don't worry.

1188
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:42,323
I'll set something up.

1189
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:47,829
Here's what
we came up with.

1190
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:50,432
There is a Nina
Orleans in the system.

1191
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:53,368
Committed to teargarden
15 years ago.

1192
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,702
An addict.

1193
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:57,138
Apparently the addiction
took her over the edge.

1194
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,807
She had a daughter.

1195
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:01,209
And the daughter was taken
away and placed in foster care.

1196
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,277
That's who we're looking for!

1197
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:03,378
Is she still there?

1198
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,246
Oh, there's an issue
with teargarden.

1199
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,215
They've never kept good records.

1200
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:08,550
They've since cleaned house.

1201
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:11,786
About five years ago,
the times ran an expose.

1202
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:14,489
Unfortunately, there's a
gap in the information.

1203
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,391
Is there another
place we can look?

1204
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,259
Well, I would suggest
going right there.

1205
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,329
There's piles of
handwritten case records

1206
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:23,498
that have never been entered.

1207
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,767
I wouldn't know where
to begin to look.

1208
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:27,502
Oh, I can help you with that.

1209
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:29,237
Brenda, I wanted
to let you know

1210
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,405
how wonderful it
is that you have

1211
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:32,707
been of such great assistance.

1212
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:36,177
I'll call blythe bowlby,
and I'll set everything up.

1213
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:37,645
John can accompany you.

1214
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,447
He is familiar with
the data interface,

1215
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,149
and he'll know
who to speak with.

1216
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:42,684
Great.

1217
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:45,553
And thank you very
much for the gift, ram.

1218
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:47,255
You're very welcome.

1219
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:48,857
It says it all, doesn't it?

1220
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:50,625
Predocs work so many
hours in the day

1221
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,127
that we're always pooped.

1222
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,603
So what kind of
music you into, man?

1223
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:03,872
I really don't know how
that is of importance.

1224
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:05,373
It can be.

1225
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,875
Depending.

1226
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:08,543
Depending on?

1227
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,478
Well, when I slam
through coding,

1228
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,516
listening to grizzly bear helps.

1229
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:15,884
But that's an exception.

1230
01:09:15,886 --> 01:09:18,186
I don't like lame-stream.

1231
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:19,754
Fascinating.

1232
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:22,690
Or when I'm clubbing, mc
boy, "transmission of love."

1233
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:25,927
I like something more intense.

1234
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:28,596
These groups don't play
at the clubs near campus.

1235
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:31,266
At hung lo's, on the westside.

1236
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:34,869
Never heard of it.

1237
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,405
You should check
it out some time.

1238
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,341
If you're into guys.

1239
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,743
What?

1240
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:44,379
What would make you say
something like that to me?

1241
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,181
Hung lo's, it's
a gay club I like.

1242
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:51,352
Oh.

1243
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,321
I'm so happy.

1244
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:55,557
I thought you were talking
about that Chinese restaurant,

1245
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:56,758
hung Lao's.

1246
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,692
No.

1247
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,761
No, hung lo.

1248
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:01,963
It's a place to get
down and let loose.

1249
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:06,301
Would you like to hear a
song I'm thinking in my head?

1250
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,603
She's not your girlfriend.

1251
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:09,671
She's not your girlfriend.

1252
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:10,438
It's ok, man.

1253
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,507
Relax.

1254
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:18,947
Gentlemen, please
come this way.

1255
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:35,230
That's mine.

1256
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:35,897
That's mine.

1257
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,899
It's mine.

1258
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:40,368
Thank you.

1259
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:40,868
No problem.

1260
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,937
Thank you.

1261
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:47,709
Gentlemen.

1262
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,649
You see that row
of records here?

1263
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:58,019
Our people went through them in
preparation for digitization.

1264
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:02,490
We did not find any records of
what happened to Nina Orleans.

1265
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:04,592
Nothing.

1266
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,828
What was most
likely her outcome?

1267
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,763
Most likely, she
wasn't discharged.

1268
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,299
That rarely has happened.

1269
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,668
She probably passed on.

1270
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,937
She was pretty bad off.

1271
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:19,674
Someone in her condition
doesn't have a long life.

1272
01:11:19,676 --> 01:11:22,777
I'm sorry I couldn't have more
definitive news or happier news

1273
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,813
for that matter.

1274
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:27,849
It's ok.

1275
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:29,784
Thank you for your
generous time.

1276
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,586
Anything to help
Brenda's group.

1277
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:34,355
Her modernization of the
state's health services system

1278
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:35,990
is most appreciated.

1279
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:38,493
Some people were here for
years, and no one even

1280
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,560
knew who they were.

1281
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,369
You lose your mind.

1282
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:49,604
They lose your identity.

1283
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:51,539
This suck-- oh, sorry, dude.

1284
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:52,006
It's ok.

1285
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:53,341
It's ok.

1286
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,710
She might be with
the lost souls.

1287
01:11:55,712 --> 01:11:57,612
What's that, my friend?

1288
01:11:57,614 --> 01:12:01,482
She might be with
the lost souls.

1289
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,417
Well put.

1290
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,324
Downstairs, in
the library of ash.

1291
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:17,365
It used to be, when someone
died here at teargarden,

1292
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:21,636
sometimes there was
no one to claim them.

1293
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:24,739
They were cremated.

1294
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:28,042
And their remains
were stored here.

1295
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:31,412
Those are the lost souls.

1296
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:34,449
In the cans.

1297
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:35,717
They call it the library of ash.

1298
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:45,460
This is extraordinarily
generous, Clayton.

1299
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:46,060
I don't understand.

1300
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,362
How is this possible?

1301
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:49,130
There's a sword
of damocles hanging

1302
01:12:49,132 --> 01:12:52,600
over the entire
pharmaceutical industry.

1303
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:53,901
It's being kept quiet.

1304
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:57,105
But the therapeutic
power of drugs

1305
01:12:57,107 --> 01:13:01,376
has been steadily waning
for several years now.

1306
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:04,379
We're losing the battle
to help the mind, William.

1307
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,748
There's a worldwide scramble
for the next psychoactive.

1308
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,752
Yes, but how does this
tie into Jack's research.

1309
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:15,990
He may have stumbled onto a
gateway to a major advancement.

1310
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,795
Please, sit, Dr. sutree.

1311
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,404
You and I are
alike in some ways.

1312
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:33,508
We both started with a childhood
fascination with the sciences.

1313
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,576
It came from observing
the things in life

1314
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,979
that are full of whimsy.

1315
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:42,617
It's very seductive,
especially to a young mind.

1316
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:46,154
And you and I, unlike
the average Joe,

1317
01:13:46,156 --> 01:13:49,457
we took things a step further.

1318
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:54,195
We observed the whimsical, but
we backed it up with facts.

1319
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:56,798
That's what science is.

1320
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,635
So here's where we are.

1321
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:02,637
I've secured all the
funding you'll ever

1322
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,207
need to continue your research.

1323
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:09,577
You'll have the time and
the supplies required.

1324
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:11,813
What's he mean, Billy?

1325
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:12,747
It's right here, Jack.

1326
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,084
It's the largest
amount ever granted

1327
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,453
in the history of
this department.

1328
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:26,527
But because of the,
let's say, mercurial

1329
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:31,766
behavior that's been reported,
there are conditions.

1330
01:14:31,768 --> 01:14:33,134
Ah.

1331
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,203
Conditions.

1332
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:37,772
Does it matter?

1333
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:40,575
You practically have carte
blanche to finally understand

1334
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:42,577
what you discovered.

1335
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:44,679
But where does this lead?

1336
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:47,181
What's the end result, redfield?

1337
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:49,550
Everything will be
under your direction.

1338
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:50,852
You will receive full credit.

1339
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,491
Who owns the polio vaccine?

1340
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:57,792
What?

1341
01:14:57,794 --> 01:15:00,027
The polio vaccine--
who owns the patent?

1342
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:01,796
No one.

1343
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:03,531
It wasn't for filling
the coffers of some giant

1344
01:15:03,533 --> 01:15:04,532
multinational.

1345
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:06,234
It was given to the world.

1346
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:07,802
And it made the
world a better place.

1347
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:14,008
You know, for such a brilliant
man, you can be very naive.

1348
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,511
That's occurred because
it was determined

1349
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:19,013
that the national foundation
for infantile paralysis

1350
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:22,016
could not obtain a patent.

1351
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:25,152
The real irony is that
Jonas salk's discovery

1352
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:29,590
would have benefited man even
more if it had been patented.

1353
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:33,027
Why does every discovery have
to be motivated by a cash grab?

1354
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,595
Jonathan swift said it best.

1355
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:35,630
Money is useful.

1356
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:39,000
Love of it, hazardous.

1357
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:40,902
There's nothing new here, Jack.

1358
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,737
You know this is
the way it works.

1359
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:47,542
Your hero, swift-- you know
he had meniere's disease.

1360
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:50,645
Untreatable in his day.

1361
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:52,713
Now we have meclizine
and Diazepam

1362
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,115
to help people cope with it.

1363
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:58,019
There's no denying drugs
have benefited mankind.

1364
01:15:58,021 --> 01:16:01,889
But I've been in the trenches
of your broad marketplace,

1365
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:05,126
the nursing homes where your
miracle drugs are administered.

1366
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:06,861
You know what?

1367
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,596
It's not working out too well.

1368
01:16:08,598 --> 01:16:11,332
We have zombies lying
in hospital beds.

1369
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,701
Basic cable their caregiver.

1370
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:15,937
Those poor people.

1371
01:16:15,939 --> 01:16:19,874
Desires that have been neutered.

1372
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:22,209
The system has become a
legitimized Pablo Escobar,

1373
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:25,646
and you unflinchingly supply
them, because it's big money.

1374
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:29,951
You've replaced cups of
hot tea and warm kisses

1375
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:32,253
with millions of plastic
pill organizers demanding

1376
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:35,256
What really caused
the great social shift

1377
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:39,660
It's time the windfalls were
more human and less financial.

1378
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:40,928
Don't
avoid the question.

1379
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,365
Who put all the
people in the homes?

1380
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:46,233
The families.

1381
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:52,974
Brothers, sisters, aunts,
uncles, and the children.

1382
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:55,376
They are the reason
for the avalanche

1383
01:16:55,378 --> 01:17:00,848
that has uncontrollably spilled
into countless rest homes.

1384
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,283
But you will never
in a million years

1385
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:04,819
find an individual
snowflake ever

1386
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:08,656
taking responsibility for
their part in that avalanche.

1387
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,696
You have a mother in a
nursing home, don't you?

1388
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:22,637
Can't go crying to your
mommy about this letdown.

1389
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:28,743
You, Dr. sutree, are one
sorry, sanctimonious snowflake.

1390
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:30,344
Jack, don't!

1391
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,380
Don't, Jack!

1392
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:34,949
You, sir, have just assaulted
a university board member.

1393
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:45,826
Your boy.

1394
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,852
Hi, Mel.

1395
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:15,222
My car just stranded me about
a half mile from our place.

1396
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:17,158
I know we agreed to
our separate spaces,

1397
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,326
but I got to stop by and get
something out of the garage.

1398
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,128
I promise I'll leave
as soon as I'm done.

1399
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:03,904
[Music - Marie baraton
and Pierre Andre athane,

1400
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:09,009
"a Paris les jours sans"]

1401
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:40,074
I'm done, Mel.

1402
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:43,010
I've lost everything.

1403
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,378
What?

1404
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:47,081
Maybe the job.

1405
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:48,182
The discovery.

1406
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:50,251
My colleagues.

1407
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:57,892
I remember when i
visited notre dame.

1408
01:19:57,894 --> 01:19:59,860
We had the sight of the
cathedral on our right.

1409
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:02,496
And on the left, we
crossed a bridge.

1410
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:05,232
And we ended up on
the ile Saint-Louis.

1411
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:06,801
And further down
on the left, you

1412
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:09,804
took me to the best
crepe shop I have ever

1413
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:11,539
been to, filled with locals.

1414
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:20,948
Neither one of us knew anything
about where to eat in Paris.

1415
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,584
But you had a sense, Jack.

1416
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:27,922
You had a natural
instinct about things.

1417
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:31,058
I don't know, you followed
the sense in the air

1418
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,427
and tracked the
movements of the locals.

1419
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:36,030
You observed the looks on
the faces of the people

1420
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:37,898
exiting the bistros.

1421
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:41,535
And you processed all
of that to discover

1422
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:44,338
exactly the right
places for us to go to.

1423
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,443
Who wouldn't fall in
love with a scientist who

1424
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,346
could muster his
abilities to provide

1425
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,447
his woman with a decent meal?

1426
01:20:57,953 --> 01:20:59,019
Who wouldn't fall in love?

1427
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:52,373
Thanks.

1428
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,379
Still there.

1429
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:01,548
My other charger's in the alfa.

1430
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,450
Your alfa naufrago.

1431
01:22:03,452 --> 01:22:06,053
You finally ready to get
rid of that hunk of metal?

1432
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,221
Hey.

1433
01:22:07,223 --> 01:22:09,690
I always like things
that look good.

1434
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:17,464
Any relapses from
the other day?

1435
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:18,432
It's under control.

1436
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:26,373
You saw the dresser.

1437
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:30,044
You're not crawling the walls.

1438
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:31,645
There's hope for mankind yet.

1439
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:33,280
If we're lucky.

1440
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:45,552
Forget the rumors.

1441
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:47,121
We are not ceasing
operation of this lab.

1442
01:23:48,657 --> 01:23:50,691
The department feels that,
even with Dr. sutree's absence,

1443
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:54,094
the importance of the work
demands that we continue.

1444
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:57,097
The last thing any of us want
is for the research community

1445
01:23:57,099 --> 01:24:00,701
to perceive that we
have dropped the ball.

1446
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:03,203
Ram, call me when
you hear this.

1447
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,338
I'll be visiting my mother.

1448
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,806
Thanks.

1449
01:24:05,808 --> 01:24:08,409
What's that on the
board over there?

1450
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:10,110
Ram.

1451
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,612
We formalized
what dr, sutree was

1452
01:24:11,614 --> 01:24:14,481
doing at the time
of the lab accident.

1453
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:17,518
This formula is for a gaseous
substance that he created.

1454
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,154
Once it distilled, it
cooled into a liquid.

1455
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:23,824
Was the liquid used to coat
special lenses or something

1456
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:28,095
Dr. sutree applied the
liquid directly into his eyes.

1457
01:24:28,097 --> 01:24:31,665
Where's this liquid now?

1458
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:32,833
It's gone.

1459
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:34,435
It used to be in the cabinet.

1460
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:40,274
Any idea who might
have taken it?

1461
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:43,777
We know it wasn't Dr. sutree,
because the door is open.

1462
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,412
I don't follow.

1463
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:48,315
He can't stand anything
left open-- doors, drawers,

1464
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:50,484
or anything out of its place.

1465
01:24:50,486 --> 01:24:52,719
This is a backup
pair of the goggle

1466
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,222
we developed as a delivery
mechanism for the liquid.

1467
01:24:55,224 --> 01:24:59,426
They're used to apply small
dosage directly onto the eyes.

1468
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:00,761
How long before
it takes effect?

1469
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,130
Within an hour.

1470
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,665
Here's what I want
the both of you to do.

1471
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:07,301
Immediately create a
new batch of liquid.

1472
01:25:07,303 --> 01:25:10,404
Follow the formula and
procedures exactly.

1473
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:13,474
I take it you have all
the necessary supplies.

1474
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:15,142
Actually, it's ready to go.

1475
01:25:15,144 --> 01:25:16,610
Then we'll have
something by day's end.

1476
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:17,678
Agreed?

1477
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,680
Ok.

1478
01:25:19,682 --> 01:25:23,250
If you need help or anything
else, just ring me up.

1479
01:25:23,252 --> 01:25:25,219
Sabahu al-khayer.

1480
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:27,454
Alaikum wa salam.

1481
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:28,856
Mr. tambel.

1482
01:25:28,858 --> 01:25:30,357
Could I have a word
with you, please?

1483
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:36,163
I understand you and Dr.
sutree had a close working

1484
01:25:36,165 --> 01:25:37,364
relationship.

1485
01:25:37,366 --> 01:25:38,332
I guess so.

1486
01:25:38,334 --> 01:25:40,601
He's been very supportive.

1487
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:43,203
You're near the completion
of your doctorate.

1488
01:25:43,205 --> 01:25:44,872
I want you to know
there is no reason

1489
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:47,274
to be concerned with
any interruptions that

1490
01:25:47,276 --> 01:25:48,742
might impede your goal.

1491
01:25:48,744 --> 01:25:51,345
You have the full support
of this department.

1492
01:25:51,347 --> 01:25:54,248
That is very much appreciated.

1493
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:59,153
So the department can depend
on a 100% commitment from you.

1494
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:02,289
105%.

1495
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,358
Good day, Mr. tambel.

1496
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,225
Keep up the good work.

1497
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,501
What did he want?

1498
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:18,172
Directions to nambla.

1499
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,573
Mr. sutree?

1500
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:53,273
Morning.

1501
01:26:53,275 --> 01:26:55,542
Where is she?

1502
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:57,878
We left so many messages.

1503
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:58,645
I'm so sorry.

1504
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,802
When?

1505
01:27:21,804 --> 01:27:24,304
She was extremely
nauseated and experiencing

1506
01:27:24,306 --> 01:27:27,007
a great deal of pain the
day before yesterday.

1507
01:27:27,009 --> 01:27:29,977
Her feet and ankles
were swollen.

1508
01:27:29,979 --> 01:27:33,947
Dr. Walters here rushed
her to the hospital.

1509
01:27:33,949 --> 01:27:35,616
It was her chronic infection.

1510
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:40,587
It finally shut down her
kidneys, and that was it.

1511
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:45,292
If it means anything, your
mother was so proud of you.

1512
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:53,433
She told me she was blessed
to have a son who worked hard,

1513
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:57,671
who was honest, who looked
for ways to help people.

1514
01:28:06,382 --> 01:28:09,883
It's time to do something
about the 50-ton elephant

1515
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:14,855
Sutree has suffered
a major breakdown.

1516
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:18,425
This is bellicose,
even for you, Clayton.

1517
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:20,727
I've never heard of this
happening to a faculty member.

1518
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:22,896
We live in bellicose
times, William.

1519
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:28,435
Whenever something is amiss,
you need to take action fast.

1520
01:28:28,437 --> 01:28:31,605
Yes, but this sets a
serious procedure in motion.

1521
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:34,341
A psychiatric ward?

1522
01:28:34,343 --> 01:28:35,609
Dr. doodnaugh agrees.

1523
01:28:35,611 --> 01:28:37,944
This is a serious matter.

1524
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:41,915
Azro, don't you think this
is an overly aggressive move?

1525
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:44,651
Based on the video that
Clayton shared with us

1526
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,654
and the depositions
of the witnesses,

1527
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,756
this is indeed a serious matter.

1528
01:28:49,758 --> 01:28:52,659
This man appears to be a
danger to himself and to people

1529
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:53,427
around him.

1530
01:28:53,429 --> 01:28:54,628
Depositions?

1531
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,797
Depositions are
already in place?

1532
01:28:56,799 --> 01:28:58,532
There's too much
potential on the table

1533
01:28:58,534 --> 01:29:00,367
to hesitate one second.

1534
01:29:00,369 --> 01:29:01,668
Where does this leave Jack?

1535
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,004
He'll have some of the
best care available.

1536
01:29:04,006 --> 01:29:06,340
The most important
thing is this procedure

1537
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:09,776
protects the university's
interests in the authorship

1538
01:29:09,778 --> 01:29:10,844
of the research.

1539
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:27,461
Jack?

1540
01:29:27,463 --> 01:29:28,662
You're freaking me out.

1541
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,564
You're here in my chapel?

1542
01:29:30,566 --> 01:29:31,665
It was my mom's favorite place.

1543
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:36,002
Oh.

1544
01:29:36,004 --> 01:29:37,371
My friend, I'm so sorry.

1545
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:41,441
Dear, departed one.

1546
01:29:41,443 --> 01:29:44,544
Requiescat in pace.

1547
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,079
Please, come this way.

1548
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:47,714
You shouldn't be
standing here alone.

1549
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:48,615
It's ok.

1550
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,083
I'm good.

1551
01:29:50,085 --> 01:29:52,452
Plus, I asked my research
assistant to meet me here.

1552
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:53,754
So I should stay inside.

1553
01:29:53,756 --> 01:29:56,423
Listen, something's happened.

1554
01:29:56,425 --> 01:30:02,596
Maybe a breakthrough in this
thing I'm struggling with.

1555
01:30:02,598 --> 01:30:04,064
Ram, good.

1556
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:06,032
Your mechanic said this
replacement part should work.

1557
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:08,034
Do you know reverend halloway?

1558
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:08,702
I do now.

1559
01:30:08,704 --> 01:30:09,403
Namaste.

1560
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:10,971
Namaste.

1561
01:30:10,973 --> 01:30:11,872
Follow my thinking, Stuart.

1562
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:22,582
Consider your reflection
in the mirror or the sight

1563
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,618
of a rainbow in the sky.

1564
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:26,086
Neither is really there.

1565
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:29,423
But the image is projected
on the back of your retina.

1566
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:31,725
You can take a picture
of them with a camera.

1567
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:34,761
But the things I'm seeing
cannot be photographed.

1568
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:39,166
They only exist
here, in my head.

1569
01:30:39,168 --> 01:30:41,435
Why in your head?

1570
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:51,812
Remember the onion
you talked about?

1571
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:57,083
What defines why we see it?

1572
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:02,489
Waves.

1573
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:03,757
Light waves.

1574
01:31:03,759 --> 01:31:05,025
Waves from all
sorts of directions.

1575
01:31:05,027 --> 01:31:07,761
Where they interfere
defines that onion.

1576
01:31:07,763 --> 01:31:13,900
You show me it's cosmic
and intimate, all at once.

1577
01:31:13,902 --> 01:31:17,704
A beautiful, mysterious
thing full of query.

1578
01:31:17,706 --> 01:31:20,207
Light waves are a form
of visible energy.

1579
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:22,209
Somehow, through
the lab accident,

1580
01:31:22,211 --> 01:31:27,214
I've become sensitive to other
forms of invisible energy.

1581
01:31:27,216 --> 01:31:31,651
You're saying you can see
the very energy of life?

1582
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,520
Jack, may I?

1583
01:31:33,522 --> 01:31:35,956
When you saw sunny-girl,
what did you see?

1584
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:37,257
She was happy.

1585
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:39,526
Very happy, the
way she always was.

1586
01:31:39,528 --> 01:31:40,794
That's her essence, Jack.

1587
01:31:40,796 --> 01:31:42,662
You were seeing her
essence-- the energy

1588
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:45,565
of the essence of what she was.

1589
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:47,834
Reverend halloway, Jack has
this very special connection

1590
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,569
with one subject we met.

1591
01:31:49,571 --> 01:31:51,004
He had one test
session with her.

1592
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,807
A homeless musician, bazemint.

1593
01:31:53,809 --> 01:31:56,209
When we first met, I had
an unusually strong vision

1594
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:58,178
with her unlike all the others.

1595
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:01,848
During the session, she
touched my shoulder.

1596
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,984
That's when I saw even
more than her essence,

1597
01:32:03,986 --> 01:32:05,519
if that's what we're calling it.

1598
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:07,087
I started seeing things
that affect her essence.

1599
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:13,860
Our senses are the
gateway to our mind.

1600
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:17,197
Perhaps now, the
gateway to the soul.

1601
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,533
Is a final theory
of consciousness

1602
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:26,640
at hand, a way to translate and
study the metadata of the soul?

1603
01:32:26,642 --> 01:32:28,675
The girl you were
studying-- when will you

1604
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:29,643
work with her again?

1605
01:32:29,645 --> 01:32:31,545
It's not possible now.

1606
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:33,079
Dr. redfield has
taken over the lab.

1607
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:37,984
it's imperative that you come
up with solid substantiation,

1608
01:32:37,986 --> 01:32:40,554
indisputable proof,
of what you have.

1609
01:32:40,556 --> 01:32:43,957
Or you're going to be gorged
by a pack of hungry wolves.

1610
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:47,661
I can't get in without
Medina or redfield.

1611
01:32:47,663 --> 01:32:48,728
No, I have to get in somehow.

1612
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,664
I need to retrieve the flask.

1613
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:52,966
But it's missing
from the cabinet.

1614
01:32:52,968 --> 01:32:55,235
Oh, I didn't leave
it in the cabinet.

1615
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:57,203
Dr. sutree, huzzah!

1616
01:32:57,205 --> 01:32:58,805
Go pick up bazemint.

1617
01:32:58,807 --> 01:33:00,273
I'm going to drop the
starter in my car.

1618
01:33:00,275 --> 01:33:01,942
Stuart, can you
get us into a lab?

1619
01:33:01,944 --> 01:33:03,877
Ram can let you know the
specifics on the monitoring

1620
01:33:03,879 --> 01:33:04,778
equipment.

1621
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:05,812
I'll make some calls.

1622
01:33:05,814 --> 01:33:07,080
Let me know when you're ready.

1623
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,149
Great.

1624
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:17,290
Like-- like this?

1625
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:19,359
Yes.

1626
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,898
Now we wait.

1627
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:27,300
Did you want to go through any
of the analyses on the drives?

1628
01:33:27,302 --> 01:33:29,369
We have them.

1629
01:33:29,371 --> 01:33:31,905
Were there any handwritten
materials generated?

1630
01:33:31,907 --> 01:33:32,973
Those are filed back here.

1631
01:33:44,186 --> 01:33:47,921
I gave bazemint the
news about her mother.

1632
01:33:47,923 --> 01:33:48,989
What do you mean?

1633
01:33:48,991 --> 01:33:53,159
I think you need to come here
and speak with her in person.

1634
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:54,628
Shoot me your location.

1635
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:56,696
On my way.

1636
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,808
Bazemint, I'm really sorry
about the news of your mom.

1637
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:11,177
But you agree, it's better that
you know what happened, right?

1638
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:12,078
It's not the news.

1639
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,649
My mama never got no respect,
not even when she died.

1640
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,349
I don't understand.

1641
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:18,952
How would you know
she was disrespected?

1642
01:34:18,954 --> 01:34:19,819
Not then.

1643
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:21,421
Now.

1644
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:24,424
That woman's ashes are sitting
on a punk-ass shelf in a closet

1645
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:26,793
in a goddamn closet.

1646
01:34:26,795 --> 01:34:28,762
That's no way to leave a person.

1647
01:34:28,764 --> 01:34:30,397
My mama needs to be respected.

1648
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:32,799
She needs to be buried.

1649
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:34,901
Ram, will they allow that?

1650
01:34:34,903 --> 01:34:36,336
It's going to be
difficult, Jack.

1651
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:37,971
None of the canisters are ided.

1652
01:34:37,973 --> 01:34:39,406
They're all grouped by date.

1653
01:34:39,408 --> 01:34:41,174
It's a lack of records.

1654
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:42,976
Bazemint, what if i
petition the institute

1655
01:34:42,978 --> 01:34:44,044
to bury all the canisters?

1656
01:34:44,046 --> 01:34:45,712
Would that be ok with you?

1657
01:34:45,714 --> 01:34:46,813
She needs her own space.

1658
01:34:46,815 --> 01:34:48,381
She needs her own respect.

1659
01:34:48,383 --> 01:34:49,983
She weren't perfect.

1660
01:34:49,985 --> 01:34:51,217
I know that.

1661
01:34:51,219 --> 01:34:54,788
But my mama should
have her final respect.

1662
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:56,856
It's tough, Jack.

1663
01:34:56,858 --> 01:35:00,827
There are hundreds of cans.

1664
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:03,229
No, there's a way.

1665
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:06,066
Bazemint, I promise
you, I will find which

1666
01:35:06,068 --> 01:35:07,867
canister has your mom's ashes.

1667
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:09,169
How can you do that?

1668
01:35:09,171 --> 01:35:11,705
I'm asking you to
trust me on this.

1669
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,773
Ok.

1670
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:17,744
How you gonna do that?

1671
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:19,112
Don't forget.

1672
01:35:19,114 --> 01:35:20,080
We got al-Gore-rhythms.

1673
01:36:40,427 --> 01:36:41,995
Just me, Clay.

1674
01:36:41,997 --> 01:36:42,896
Bleu?

1675
01:36:42,898 --> 01:36:44,464
You're still here?

1676
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:47,100
Yeah, I was coming to bring
you the signed hospitalization

1677
01:36:47,102 --> 01:36:48,001
form.

1678
01:36:48,003 --> 01:36:49,369
It's in the other bag.

1679
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:56,876
I double-checked the formula
and the methodologies.

1680
01:36:56,878 --> 01:37:00,480
We followed everything exactly.

1681
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:04,284
Well, nothing happened.

1682
01:37:04,286 --> 01:37:09,455
It appears this phenomenon
is specific going to sutree.

1683
01:37:09,457 --> 01:37:11,958
I fear he holds some
missing information.

1684
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:19,265
Yes?

1685
01:37:19,267 --> 01:37:21,901
I see.

1686
01:37:21,903 --> 01:37:26,272
Ms. Hamid, tell me what
business does Mr. tambel have

1687
01:37:26,274 --> 01:37:28,541
at the teargarden institute.

1688
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:43,590
So many visions
to psychoanalyze.

1689
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:53,299
The politician screaming
the bleedin' lies.

1690
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:01,608
You burn down the highway,
leaving no place to run.

1691
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:07,347
Hey, shake, babe.

1692
01:38:07,349 --> 01:38:12,285
Shake off your demon
and watch that angel go.

1693
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:36,409
This is going to take a while.

1694
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:41,381
We'll find her.

1695
01:38:41,383 --> 01:38:42,315
Ready, Jack.

1696
01:38:48,656 --> 01:38:50,023
Come out.

1697
01:38:50,025 --> 01:38:52,091
All of you, please.

1698
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:57,096
What's up with Mr. clean?

1699
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:58,698
This is Dr. redfield, bazemint.

1700
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:01,501
Do you both realize that
you are assisting a man who

1701
01:39:01,503 --> 01:39:03,102
is in serious trouble?

1702
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:04,237
Careful, redfield.

1703
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,673
I assault board of
regents members.

1704
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:10,176
Why did he lock the door?

1705
01:39:10,178 --> 01:39:11,678
There's no way out!

1706
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,645
Redfield, please.

1707
01:39:12,647 --> 01:39:14,280
You need supervision.

1708
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:15,515
Get the guard to open this door.

1709
01:39:15,517 --> 01:39:16,182
Clayton!

1710
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,619
Redfield, please,
you need supervision.

1711
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:23,156
Redfield!

1712
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:41,307
We need to do further testing.

1713
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:42,041
Clayton, please.

1714
01:39:45,346 --> 01:39:47,280
Clayton, listen to me.

1715
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:49,015
Do not use the goggles.

1716
01:39:49,017 --> 01:39:50,016
There are side effects.

1717
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:57,056
Clayton!

1718
01:39:57,058 --> 01:39:59,225
Do not use the goggles.

1719
01:39:59,227 --> 01:40:00,626
We need to do more testing.

1720
01:40:00,628 --> 01:40:03,029
There are side effects.

1721
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:04,364
Clayton, please.

1722
01:40:04,366 --> 01:40:06,566
You gotta listen to me.

1723
01:40:08,069 --> 01:40:08,601
Redfield--

1724
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:12,038
oh.

1725
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:12,538
Oh.

1726
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,539
Back.

1727
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:17,477
Stay back.

1728
01:41:19,773 --> 01:41:20,540
Ma-- mama?

1729
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,147
Oh, you're my mama.

1730
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:29,282
I know it.

1731
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:39,826
Clayton!

1732
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:46,499
Get one of the doctors, now.

1733
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:48,501
Get his buttons.

1734
01:41:48,503 --> 01:41:49,735
Stay with us, Clayton.

1735
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:58,644
Are you-- are you ok?

1736
01:41:58,646 --> 01:42:02,548
What can I do for you?

1737
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:05,184
Oh, my child.

1738
01:42:05,186 --> 01:42:05,785
Would you look at that?

1739
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:07,787
It is.

1740
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:10,456
Are you real?

1741
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:12,291
You better believe I'm real.

1742
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:17,430
Bee never moves without
being led by someone.

1743
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:21,701
Oh, mama.

1744
01:42:21,703 --> 01:42:23,169
Oh, my child.

1745
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:29,142
Oh, my little child.

1746
01:42:38,619 --> 01:42:40,753
What is that woman's name?

1747
01:42:40,755 --> 01:42:42,455
She's patient 108.

1748
01:42:42,457 --> 01:42:44,624
But everyone here calls her bee.

1749
01:42:44,626 --> 01:42:47,660
She's only ever played
one song on that piano.

1750
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:49,395
Professor Jack.

1751
01:42:49,397 --> 01:42:50,696
That's my mama, that's my mama.

1752
01:42:50,698 --> 01:42:52,198
I knows it.

1753
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,299
Are you sure?

1754
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:54,901
I knows it in my bones.

1755
01:42:54,903 --> 01:42:55,735
That's how sure I am.

1756
01:42:55,737 --> 01:42:57,236
Ok.

1757
01:42:57,238 --> 01:43:01,307
This patient's records
were lost years ago.

1758
01:43:01,309 --> 01:43:04,911
Anything that you have that
can help us with her identity

1759
01:43:04,913 --> 01:43:06,212
will be helpful.

1760
01:43:06,214 --> 01:43:07,547
I'm from cu.

1761
01:43:07,549 --> 01:43:09,749
Bazemint is working with
us on an important study.

1762
01:43:09,751 --> 01:43:11,417
We can help confirm
this woman's identity.

1763
01:43:11,419 --> 01:43:12,718
Just let us know what you need.

1764
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,521
Coming through.

1765
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:16,822
What happened to him?

1766
01:43:16,824 --> 01:43:18,291
Too many drugs.

1767
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:50,756
Stand here, please.

1768
01:43:57,232 --> 01:43:57,863
Ok, thank you.

1769
01:43:57,865 --> 01:43:58,598
Stand there.

1770
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,999
Good.

1771
01:44:00,001 --> 01:44:03,236
The test program seems
to have caught on.

1772
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:06,906
We can handle maybe
30 more candidates.

1773
01:44:06,908 --> 01:44:09,675
Has Jack had any progress
on expanding the formula?

1774
01:44:09,677 --> 01:44:12,445
We haven't found a
substitute for what

1775
01:44:12,447 --> 01:44:14,814
he calls the sunny-girl factor.

1776
01:44:14,816 --> 01:44:15,748
Stay with it.

1777
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:20,987
May I?

1778
01:44:52,919 --> 01:44:55,521
Bazemint says you a mover.

1779
01:44:55,523 --> 01:44:58,391
Talking about freeafying
the mind and shit.

1780
01:44:58,393 --> 01:45:01,327
You're always
looking for something.

1781
01:45:01,329 --> 01:45:03,863
Everyone is.

1782
01:45:03,865 --> 01:45:07,833
But there's one thing you
really want-- the truth.

1783
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:13,306
Man, who don't want the truth?

1784
01:45:13,308 --> 01:45:14,874
It sure would make
things a lot easier

1785
01:45:14,876 --> 01:45:16,876
rather than all the bullshit.

1786
01:45:16,878 --> 01:45:21,547
The thing is you
already know the truth.

1787
01:45:21,549 --> 01:45:23,849
You just never had the
opportunity to express it.

1788
01:45:23,851 --> 01:45:26,819
Damn straight.

1789
01:45:26,821 --> 01:45:30,356
It's time you try
another way to speak.

1790
01:45:30,358 --> 01:45:31,791
Who's going to listen
to someone like me?

1791
01:45:35,429 --> 01:45:36,996
Give this to the person
at the table out there.

1792
01:45:46,506 --> 01:45:47,973
Hey.

1793
01:45:47,975 --> 01:45:49,875
You, me.

1794
01:45:49,877 --> 01:45:52,678
We get our grounding from
wherever we can find it.

1795
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:53,512
Good luck.

1796
01:46:00,821 --> 01:46:03,055
This is the address of
the Williams art center.

1797
01:46:03,057 --> 01:46:05,725
Tomorrow, they will be
expecting you at 10:00 am.

1798
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:10,096
Why?

1799
01:46:10,098 --> 01:46:12,431
You'll begin your new class.

1800
01:46:12,433 --> 01:46:13,999
Just show up.

1801
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:18,604
Everything else-- supplies,
lunch-- has been taken care of.

1802
01:46:18,606 --> 01:46:21,140
What class?

1803
01:46:21,142 --> 01:46:21,841
Canvas painting.

1804
01:46:36,022 --> 01:46:37,757
The connection you
have with each person.

1805
01:46:40,894 --> 01:46:42,628
Pretty intense.

1806
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:46,866
I saw a vet earlier today.

1807
01:46:46,868 --> 01:46:49,835
He was a hostage in Iraq.

1808
01:46:49,837 --> 01:46:52,705
He asked his captor
when he would be free.

1809
01:46:52,707 --> 01:46:54,473
The captor, the
person in control,

1810
01:46:54,475 --> 01:47:00,913
said, when you are
free, I will be free.

1811
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:03,516
The captor and the captive.

1812
01:47:03,518 --> 01:47:05,017
The rich and the poor.

1813
01:47:05,019 --> 01:47:08,120
The educated and the ignorant.

1814
01:47:08,122 --> 01:47:09,955
Every minute, day,
and night, we're

1815
01:47:09,957 --> 01:47:12,792
putting something out there.

1816
01:47:12,794 --> 01:47:14,160
Naked truth.

1817
01:47:14,162 --> 01:47:15,795
Hatred.

1818
01:47:15,797 --> 01:47:17,029
Intense passion.

1819
01:47:17,031 --> 01:47:18,030
Jealousy.

1820
01:47:18,032 --> 01:47:18,731
Smarts.

1821
01:47:18,733 --> 01:47:20,132
Dominance.

1822
01:47:20,134 --> 01:47:22,435
Submissiveness.

1823
01:47:22,437 --> 01:47:25,070
Indifference.

1824
01:47:25,072 --> 01:47:27,106
Love.

1825
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:30,209
It's all that undying
energy Einstein described

1826
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:34,747
moving, clashing, merging.

1827
01:47:34,749 --> 01:47:40,753
That's why we can
never escape the effect

1828
01:47:40,755 --> 01:47:41,854
we have on each other.

1829
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:50,496
Give it a fly beat that
will dance down the street.

1830
01:47:53,034 --> 01:47:53,799
Uh-huh.

1831
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:54,667
There you go.

1832
01:47:59,073 --> 01:48:00,606
There you go.

1833
01:48:03,977 --> 01:48:04,944
It's starting, Jack.

1834
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:11,150
Let's go.

1835
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:29,101
She wakes up early
every morning just to do her

1836
01:48:29,103 --> 01:48:32,805
hair now, because
she cares, y'all.

1837
01:48:32,807 --> 01:48:38,110
Her hair wouldn't be
right without her makeup.

1838
01:48:38,112 --> 01:48:40,813
She's never out of makeup.

1839
01:48:40,815 --> 01:48:43,582
She's just like you and me.

1840
01:48:43,584 --> 01:48:46,085
But she's homeless.

1841
01:48:46,087 --> 01:48:49,088
She's homeless.

1842
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:52,057
And she stands there
singing for money.

1843
01:48:52,059 --> 01:48:54,059
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1844
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:56,061
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1845
01:48:56,063 --> 01:48:58,063
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1846
01:48:58,065 --> 01:49:01,233
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1847
01:49:01,235 --> 01:49:05,004
In my sleep, I see her
begging, reaching, please.

1848
01:49:09,242 --> 01:49:14,013
Although the problem's
not mine, I ask god, why?

1849
01:49:14,015 --> 01:49:16,715
God, oh, why?

1850
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:19,718
She's just like you and me.

1851
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:22,021
But she's homeless.

1852
01:49:22,023 --> 01:49:24,990
She's homeless.

1853
01:49:24,992 --> 01:49:28,694
And she stands there
singing for money.

1854
01:49:28,696 --> 01:49:29,995
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1855
01:49:29,997 --> 01:49:31,997
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1856
01:49:31,999 --> 01:49:33,999
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1857
01:49:34,001 --> 01:49:35,968
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1858
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:37,970
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1859
01:49:37,972 --> 01:49:39,672
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1860
01:49:39,674 --> 01:49:41,674
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1861
01:49:41,676 --> 01:49:43,676
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1862
01:49:43,678 --> 01:49:46,946
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da,
la-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1863
01:49:46,948 --> 01:49:48,948
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1864
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:50,950
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1865
01:49:50,952 --> 01:49:52,952
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1866
01:49:52,954 --> 01:49:54,653
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1867
01:49:54,655 --> 01:49:56,221
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1868
01:49:56,223 --> 01:49:57,957
La-da-Dee.
