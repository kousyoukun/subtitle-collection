1
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,706
Do you use Ketamine?

2
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,341
No, Pentobarbital.

3
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,143
The first injection
will induce sleep.

4
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:49,681
So any pain sunny-girl is
experiencing will stop.

5
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:53,051
The second injection will
slowly shut down her functions.

6
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,653
Then she can have a
blessed eternal rest.

7
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,029
Are you a professional or
a psychic pet whisperer?

8
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,879
There's not much that can be
done because of her age, Mel.

9
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,181
Her stomach's flipped.

10
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,849
The surgery would
be too stressful.

11
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:28,053
She just... she wouldn't survive.

12
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,821
Oh, Jack.

13
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,102
Goodbye, proud girl.

14
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,159
I appreciate you getting
sunny-girl and me.

15
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,898
I know this is
killing you inside.

16
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,803
Take the time.

17
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,805
Let it play out.

18
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,410
Do you want that box of
notebooks still in the hallway?

19
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,822
I'll get it when
I pick up the rest

20
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,057
of the stuff from the garage.

21
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,993
Which will be?

22
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,495
I've got a review tomorrow.

23
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,330
The Alfa needs a battery.

24
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,398
And I'm sleeping on a couch
in my mother's studio.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,869
That's why I haven't collected
the rest of my things.

26
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,111
I see your follow-through
outside the lab hasn't changed.

27
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,543
I'll speak with you later.

28
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,346
Jack.

29
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,382
Don't shove it aside, ok?

30
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,284
It'll come back and kick
you in the ass later.

31
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:50,929
Morning, Medina.

32
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:51,996
Cheers, ram.

33
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,034
Sunny-girl?

34
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,470
She went last evening.

35
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:03,908
Arey.

36
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,476
I thought she would
have a couple months.

37
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,277
I know.

38
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,079
It's so sad.

39
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,147
Is Dr. Sutree ok?

40
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,417
When you think of
smell detection,

41
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,886
it's the nose interacting
with the brain.

42
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,321
Olfaction.

43
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,923
We are the only
research group seriously

44
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:24,495
looking into the molecular basis
of olfaction involving sight.

45
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,565
Does this liquid emit an odor?

46
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,869
How would you know?

47
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,904
Its molecules have to be
wafting through the air,

48
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,906
and our noses have
to be fairly close.

49
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,242
But if you could see
odors, think of how helpful

50
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:37,242
that would be.

51
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,611
You'd know something
about the contents

52
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,546
without the
unpleasant experience.

53
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,115
A major gas leak could be
detected from miles away.

54
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,450
I probably even know
which one of you

55
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,986
had coffee brewed from
robusta beans this morning.

56
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:52,223
This is quite a departure
from the original study, Jack.

57
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,193
I mean, insects
carry a large number

58
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,527
of debilitating diseases.

59
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,229
Stopping that spread
has always been

60
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,667
about using traditional methods
to identify what attracts them.

61
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,135
Don't underestimate light.

62
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,938
Light.

63
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,373
It's a food.

64
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,342
It nourishes our bodies
with vitamin d. It has mass.

65
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,278
It occupies space.

66
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,513
We now know it can be
slowed and stopped.

67
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,348
Yes, stopped.

68
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,517
It actually behaves differently
when it's being observed,

69
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,553
almost like it's imbued
with a consciousness.

70
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,990
Multiple wavelengths
of light mixed together

71
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,494
give us white light, a
mixture of frequencies,

72
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,230
all processed by our cortex.

73
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:36,034
But odors... the cortex must
process different chemical

74
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:41,039
structures and match them to a
stored database of known odors.

75
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,976
I think current methods to
understand this limit us.

76
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,679
They limit all olfactory-based
research, every single project

77
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,414
in the world.

78
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,251
If we can use light to
visualize specific pheromones,

79
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,520
we've taken it to
the next level.

80
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,022
Will your work also show
us why people near death

81
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,526
see a white light?

82
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,595
One concept our learned
colleagues in this room

83
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,532
are familiar with is that
the near-death experience

84
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,500
comes from the cortex
returning to full function

85
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,569
after the body's gone
through a trauma.

86
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,172
Sometimes our neuroscience
escapes those of us

87
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,473
from the pharmaceutical
industry.

88
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,375
Is a Bigfoot discovery
also imminent?

89
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,644
I thought we agreed to keep
the work involving your wife's

90
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:19,644
genetic code confidential.

91
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:24,115
At least I know where to find
my wife... at home, at night.

92
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,550
That's assuming you
left her inflated.

93
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,585
Gentlemen.

94
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:27,585
Thanks, Dr. Sutree.

95
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:32,023
We will immediately review
your latest findings.

96
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,591
We need to get to that
scheduled luncheon

97
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,833
with the rest of the committee.

98
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,375
You appear as if you've
come up empty-handed,

99
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,577
then you feign a new
discovery and bite

100
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,712
one of the hands that
feeds the institution?

101
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,582
He obviously slipped through
the evolutionary sieve.

102
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,517
That's what I'm
talking about, Jack.

103
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,053
I mean, no one is expecting
blind ass-kissing.

104
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:02,053
But these insults...

105
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,689
Ass-kissing isn't
the issue, Billy.

106
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,424
Everyone knows Redfield
got on the board

107
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:06,424
because he's in bed
with the pill companies.

108
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,761
And you can come up with
the millions necessary to run

109
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:09,761
this branch of biochemistry?

110
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,664
Kowtowing to a special interest
portends a myopic approach

111
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,366
and a lack of respect
from our colleagues

112
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:15,366
throughout the world.

113
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:20,471
At least create the appearance
of respectability, especially

114
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,541
when the work is questioned.

115
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,611
Ram is a neuroscience
graduate from Yale.

116
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,513
Medina is from the
Rockefeller university.

117
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,648
Physics and mathematical
biology are her specialties.

118
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,750
Do you seriously think
they'd be wasting their time

119
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,252
with crackpot research?

120
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,520
Where are you guys with this?

121
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,355
The evidence that Dr.
Sutree has uncovered

122
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,057
is very compelling.

123
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:39,057
Definitely exciting.

124
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:43,094
My colleagues were impressed
with the potential correlations

125
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,530
discovered here.

126
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,265
How close are you and your team?

127
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,500
Could there be
something concrete

128
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,170
by the end of the quarter?

129
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,237
It's difficult to say.

130
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,739
I'm going to see what I can do.

131
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:55,741
But no more detours.

132
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,217
Here are the latest ORNs.

133
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:06,217
Anything interesting?

134
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,153
It confirms you're on
the right track regarding

135
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,822
odor discrimination.

136
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,722
Good.

137
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,258
I'll take it from here.

138
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,194
How late you staying, boss?

139
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,530
Just want to finish prepping
these detector compounds.

140
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,632
Tomorrow.

141
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,234
Thanks, ram.

142
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,804
Are you and Mrs. Jack
still on for dinner?

143
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,673
Of course.

144
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:28,673
Hey.

145
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:33,411
I'm having a send-off for
sunny-girl tomorrow afternoon.

146
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,846
You can join me if you'd like.

147
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,114
I'm there.

148
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,751
I'm very saddened
with your loss, Jack.

149
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,820
Sunny-girl was very special.

150
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,424
She would certainly have been
honored by the Nepal Hindus.

151
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,493
Don't worry, I'm not
going vicar on you.

152
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,629
There was something unique
between you and sunny-girl.

153
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,265
It was more than friendship.

154
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,734
I'd call that spiritual.

155
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,769
I'm sad.

156
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,837
But spiritual?

157
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,242
We are scientists.

158
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,210
We compare one thing
relative to another.

159
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,312
We connect to them in
a linear, rational way

160
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,614
that makes sense to our brains.

161
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,215
Could sunny-girl
speak words with you?

162
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,550
No.

163
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,685
Could she tell
when you were sad?

164
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,921
Yes.

165
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,923
She's gone now.

166
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:23,861
Where do you feel it more...
Here or deep inside here?

167
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,464
There is a special kind of
intelligence inside here too.

168
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,700
It's a spiritual intelligence...
A spiritual energy.

169
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,472
It was more than friendship.

170
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,474
It was spiritual.

171
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,343
I appreciate the
kind thoughts, ram.

172
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:43,714
I'm bringing a young lady friend

173
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,617
who caught my eye to dinner.

174
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,686
Let me know if you
think I have a chance.

175
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,517
What?

176
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,352
Ram, something's happening.

177
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,987
He didn't even see me come in.

178
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,524
He's been at it
for over an hour.

179
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,226
My gosh.

180
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,528
He's been here all night.

181
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,596
All night?

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,401
Making breakfast for everyone?

183
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,003
I think we got
something here, ram.

184
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,871
I plugged in the
discrimination factors,

185
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,641
and they seem to have taken
things to the next level.

186
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,544
Are we talking
practical or theoretical?

187
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,446
I'm saying the cat's in the bag.

188
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,548
But it appears the
bag may be too small.

189
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,554
Ram.

190
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,622
Hit the lights.

191
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:15,873
Wow.

192
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,052
Medina!

193
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,855
Hang on.

194
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,290
Don't rub, don't rub.

195
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,893
You ok?

196
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,594
Say something, Jack.

197
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:37,695
Aah.

198
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,297
Just keep breathing.

199
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,802
Jack, doctor, say something.

200
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,804
Are you ok?

201
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,905
Ok.

202
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,606
Here you go.

203
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,040
Here you go.

204
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:49,674
Here you go.

205
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,374
Ugh!

206
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:50,374
All right.

207
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,509
Come on, this way.

208
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,511
This way.

209
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,480
I'm going to shut
down the experiment.

210
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:56,480
All right.

211
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,382
I'm going to check your eyes.

212
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,750
Lean back, please.

213
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,392
What?

214
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,994
How do you feel?

215
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,331
Like I was just shot
through the "2001" star gate.

216
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,333
Wow, my eyes felt like
they were on fire.

217
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,578
You were here all night, Jack.

218
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,848
Well, after you left, I plugged
in the ORN data you gave me.

219
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,817
It fell right into place
with the theoretical values

220
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:32,817
we set up.

221
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,119
When I saw that, I
didn't want to stop.

222
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,987
I needed to see if it
could actually work.

223
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,789
Did it?

224
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,524
I didn't get to test
all the wavelengths.

225
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:45,396
But so far, no.

226
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,497
Close but no cigar.

227
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,938
Thanks, both of you.

228
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,806
I know I can be a
taskmaster at times.

229
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,876
And I appreciate you going
with the change in direction.

230
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,046
We support your work, Jack.

231
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,916
The other things, well,
just have a bit more faith

232
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:06,984
in your staff.

233
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,893
Mhm.

234
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,862
You want some, Jack?

235
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:17,862
No.

236
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:21,499
But try to keep sunny-girl's
ashes curry-free, will you?

237
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,801
Heh.

238
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,003
Your eyes... is it the spices?

239
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,685
You know, they've never
affected me before.

240
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,410
Photophobia maybe?

241
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,612
I don't know.

242
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,646
Well, Jasmine is in bloom.

243
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,882
Maybe allergies.

244
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:38,964
Ram, roll down your window.

245
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,797
Jack, are you ok?

246
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,140
I feel a little dizzy.

247
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,718
Jack?

248
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,236
Jack, are you ok?

249
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,238
You ok, Jack?

250
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,798
Jack?

251
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,272
I saw it.

252
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,174
I saw it all.

253
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,877
What did you see?

254
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,012
The scent of the oranges.

255
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,213
The flowers' attractants.

256
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,214
The burnt hydrocarbons.

257
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,115
I could see it, ram.

258
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,149
It was all there.

259
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,251
What did you see?

260
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,119
Colors.

261
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:27,091
Even your curry in your
container and on your breath.

262
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,895
I could see the aromas swirling,
naturally flowing in the air.

263
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:30,895
It was astonishing.

264
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,230
You saw this without
the apparatus?

265
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,565
Are you sure?

266
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,167
Yes, yes, yes, of course.

267
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,771
The gases I mixed in the
lab must be some residue.

268
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,040
Why can you see this now?

269
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,308
I don't know.

270
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,284
You ever have a song
change your life?

271
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,653
There's one from a while back.

272
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:59,123
You might not be
familiar with it, ram.

273
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,660
My dad used to play
it all the time.

274
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:07,932
A song describing stardust
and billion-year-old carbon.

275
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:15,673
Those words connected
who we are here

276
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,415
to the stars in the universe.

277
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,179
And I wanted to
be a part of that.

278
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,614
That's why I went into science.

279
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,189
Now I'm about to scatter
this very special collection

280
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,091
of billion-year-old
carbon into the sea.

281
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,367
Bye, girl.

282
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,977
Ugh!

283
00:16:58,918 --> 00:16:59,918
Thanks, ram.

284
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,288
Let's get back to the lab.

285
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,796
The compounds must have gone
through some sort of change

286
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,864
when the gases distilled.

287
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,165
We can begin a full analysis.

288
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,767
Just prepare everything
in the morning

289
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,769
and wait till I get back.

290
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:21,805
Tomorrow morning.

291
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,674
Tomorrow morning.

292
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:27,711
I have to see my mom and... oh,
damn, that freaking deposition.

293
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,879
Billy, great.

294
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,880
Whoa.

295
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,714
What...

296
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,649
Oh, it's nothing.

297
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,416
There's been a breakthrough.

298
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,018
We have proof.

299
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,120
Scents, smells
can be visualized.

300
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,255
They can be seen without
any special instruments.

301
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:38,255
Seriously?

302
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,058
We're about to give every
institution researching

303
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,093
Chemoreception a run
for its money, man.

304
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,396
Can you see them now?

305
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:45,396
It was only temporary.

306
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:50,234
But I could see them flowing
out like hundreds of fountains

307
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:50,234
and at different rates.

308
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,303
Graham's law of effusion
seen with the naked eye.

309
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,874
It was uncanny,
illuminating, a radical shift

310
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,976
in our understanding
of the visual senses.

311
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,845
Imagine an app on a smart device
that you move over a patient,

312
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,214
and then it points you
in the right direction.

313
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,750
Well, I'm glad I took action.

314
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,385
What do you mean?

315
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,321
The regents... they moved
to pull the funding.

316
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,389
Oh.

317
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:21,098
I came here to tell you there's
a separate fund I can tap.

318
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,299
It's used for emergencies.

319
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,402
It will allow you to
continue for a while.

320
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,104
A while?

321
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,205
Through next month.

322
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:28,205
Christ, do me a favor.

323
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,341
Smear some testosterone
cream between your legs

324
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:31,341
and grow a pair.

325
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,911
Don't you realize
what we have here?

326
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,079
They're walking all over you!

327
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:41,251
It will have to
do for now, Jack.

328
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:45,155
And if what you're saying is
true, the funding will happen.

329
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,223
All we need is the proof.

330
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,831
Ram, let's keep
this quiet for now.

331
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,867
Even from Medina?

332
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,769
Yes.

333
00:18:58,771 --> 00:18:59,970
I'll lock up.

334
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,972
See you at dinner.

335
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,838
Damn.

336
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,944
All right, there's got to
be a better way than this.

337
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,984
Oh, hey, ram.

338
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,285
Something came up.

339
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,520
Melanie can't make it.

340
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,855
Everything ok?

341
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,258
Well, we're working
some things out.

342
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,559
I've been staying
at my mom's house.

343
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,894
No, no, I meant your eyes.

344
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:57,995
You're rubbing them.

345
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,963
Is it the same
sensation as earlier?

346
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,799
Probably a latent effect.

347
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,834
Something came up with
my dinner date as well.

348
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,804
She brought a friend.

349
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,966
How long have you been with
the university, Dr. Sutree?

350
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:22,586
Sorry.

351
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:22,586
Over a decade.

352
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:27,291
And ram tells me that your lab
is involved with world health.

353
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,861
Yes, practically every
university research group

354
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,198
is trying to eradicate the
spread of malaria and dengue.

355
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,967
Studying the odors
our bodies give off

356
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,435
could be a way to help do that.

357
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,438
Mosquitoes seem to be
attracted to these odors.

358
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,340
Wouldn't improving
the infrastructure

359
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,944
so that cleanliness wasn't
an issue keep them away?

360
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:50,080
It's more complicated than that.

361
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,083
Our bodies also
give off natural pheromones,

362
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,985
regardless of our cleanliness.

363
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:59,022
Sounds like there is more
to attraction than just

364
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:03,360
wearing aftershave or perfume.

365
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,262
Oh, I daresay pheromone
detection would even

366
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,865
be able to tell when
a woman is ovulating.

367
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:12,436
Dr. Sutree, has your department
tapped into the data mining

368
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,572
modules that Brenda's
group has developed?

369
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,940
Not that I'm aware of.

370
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,343
John is an amazing programmer.

371
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,179
He's been assisting me on
the voice-pert project.

372
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,482
The goal is for workers
throughout the state health

373
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,286
care system to be able
to instantaneously search

374
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,322
any database via
voice recognition.

375
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,524
She's just impressed because I'm

376
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,927
really sensitive to
semicolons and parentheses.

377
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,530
So John, will you be
staying and ordering

378
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,200
food or just having a drink?

379
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,401
Yeah.

380
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:44,401
I haven't eaten.

381
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,671
I only ask because when I
invited Brenda to dinner,

382
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,073
I didn't know that an expert
in parentheses and semicolons

383
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,341
would be joining us.

384
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,944
Oh, I apologize, ram.

385
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,914
I just thought it would be good
for John to meet Dr. Sutree.

386
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,081
We'll take care of our part.

387
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,216
No problem, dude.

388
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,550
I can cover myself.

389
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,486
How about some oyster shooters?

390
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:02,486
Yeah.

391
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:06,123
We're doing studies on
parasites that cannot survive

392
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,659
without their host or hostess.

393
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,460
Cool.

394
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,496
Did I miss
something, Dr. Sutree?

395
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,464
Oh, I was just
thinking, it's a bold man

396
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,400
who first ate an oyster.

397
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,302
Tell me about it.

398
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,437
Well, that was one of the
most interesting dinners

399
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,505
I've ever had.

400
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:25,414
Do you think I have a
chance with Brenda, Jack?

401
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,250
Ram, there's a
western expression

402
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,018
that associates
potential romance

403
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,521
with an ocean of sea life.

404
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,122
You may want to
swim yourself over

405
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,444
to a different
section of the sea.

406
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,795
This pair seems a bit small, ma.

407
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,232
I've always been a size 7.

408
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,534
I guarantee you not
one part of my body

409
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,770
has grown with that
food they give me.

410
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,472
Grown with?

411
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:11,408
I thought you were
a proud grammarian.

412
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,443
Being chair-bound for a
year could have something

413
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,345
to do with it, don't you think?

414
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,413
Nonsense.

415
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,415
There we go.

416
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,452
If it feels too tight, I
don't want you wearing them,

417
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,421
no matter how good they look.

418
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:28,125
You sometimes have to
suffer for beauty, hon.

419
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,662
You're already beautiful, and
it wasn't from any suffering.

420
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,498
Your father wouldn't
have agreed with that.

421
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:42,205
I'll take them.

422
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,175
Ok.

423
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,743
One, two, three.

424
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,849
Are you comfortable, Katie?

425
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,851
I'm ok.

426
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,721
Nurse?

427
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,257
Why did the doctor add
these three new medications?

428
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:05,362
Your mother was complaining
she wasn't able to get to sleep.

429
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,830
Ma, how do you feel?

430
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,331
I'm tired.

431
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,102
Ask the doctor not to be so
liberal with the medication.

432
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:20,710
Shoe shopping is exhausting,
even for a young person.

433
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,279
I got to go now, ma.

434
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,814
I'm heading downtown.

435
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,751
A new one?

436
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:31,888
I finished it in art
class a few days ago.

437
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,624
Beautiful.

438
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,926
I love you.

439
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,194
Rest.

440
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:12,862
Do you know him, Mr. Sutree?

441
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,531
I thought I did, but no.

442
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:18,401
Why are you taking his picture?

443
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,370
How does he look to you?

444
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,772
He wasn't doing
well last evening.

445
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,909
But he's stable now.

446
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,577
You ok?

447
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,712
I'm late for a meeting.

448
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,452
Dr.
Sutree has arrived.

449
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,421
Thank you.

450
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,557
My apologies for the delay.

451
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,493
Just be seated, Dr.
Sutree, and we'll begin.

452
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,929
We appreciate you agreeing
to be an expert witness.

453
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,565
Sure.

454
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,001
Could I have some water, please?

455
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,570
This is the videotaped
deposition of John Benjamin

456
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,306
Sutree taken by counsel for
the plaintiff in the matter

457
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,609
of "Karin Honeygrove versus
Bioren pharmaceuticals,"

458
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,312
held in the offices of Tromo,
Gatelitt, Roberts located

459
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,415
at 304 Broadway, los
Angeles, California.

460
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,584
If counsel would now please
state their appearances

461
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,819
starting with the party
noticing this deposition.

462
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,821
Marsha tweed,
representing the plaintiff.

463
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,591
Van Tromo, representing
Bioren pharmaceuticals.

464
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,393
Please state your
full legal name.

465
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,794
And John Benjamin Sutree.

466
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,530
And Mr. Sutree, what is
your present home address?

467
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,700
815 garden road... sorry.

468
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,537
1956 victory Lane, Los Angeles.

469
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,738
How long have you lived there?

470
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,609
Um, two months.

471
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,077
Please raise your right hand.

472
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,946
Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you will give here

473
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,516
in this deposition proceeding
be the truth, the whole truth,

474
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:40,617
and nothing but the truth?

475
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,818
I do.

476
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,753
Are you here today
under subpoena, sir?

477
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,488
Yes, I am.

478
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,057
Let's start with your
medical background.

479
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,892
Are you a medical doctor?

480
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,960
No, I'm a doctor of science.

481
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,430
I have a PHD in biological
sciences from Stanford.

482
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,964
Any other degrees?

483
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,767
A bachelor's in
physics and a master's

484
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,870
in medical biochemistry from
the university of Chicago.

485
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,106
Doctor, what is your
current occupation?

486
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,342
I'm employed as the head
of olfactory research

487
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:05,342
at city university.

488
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:09,112
Did you attend the meeting
at Bioren pharmaceuticals

489
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,082
December 17, 2010?

490
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,051
I did attend the meeting,
but I'm not sure of the date.

491
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,588
Why did you attend the meeting?

492
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,858
Specifically to do a detailed
analysis of the ingredients

493
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,494
for a new aerosol spray that
permitted the user to inhale

494
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,464
rather than digest vitamins.

495
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,666
We were there to present
our take on the ingredients.

496
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,434
At this meeting at
Bioren, sir, was there

497
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,670
discussion as to any possible
ill effects from the vitamin

498
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,872
spray?

499
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,841
That meeting encompassed
a number of findings,

500
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:41,411
but none that I recall
discussed Noxae gradients.

501
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,080
Spell that please.

502
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:48,118
N-o-x-a-e.

503
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,453
And does that mean?

504
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,755
It's the plural of noxious.

505
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,456
It refers to a
poisonous substance.

506
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,058
I object.

507
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,693
We're beginning to
get into what sounds

508
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,395
like protected materials.

509
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,896
I'm instructing
you not to answer,

510
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,065
as this information
violates a confidentiality

511
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,767
agreement with Bioren.

512
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,803
I further object under paragraph
9 of the case management order.

513
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,705
On the contrary, he must answer.

514
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,573
You are required to
answer the questions, sir.

515
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,075
Just a moment.

516
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,843
Maybe it's time we make a
phone call to judge Renfrew

517
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,912
to discuss the terms of
the case management order.

518
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,548
This entire line of
inquiry is in violation

519
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,484
of a confidentiality agreement
and may violate the case

520
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:21,484
management order.

521
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,454
Sir, I don't know of anything
in the previous order that

522
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,755
permits you to call
judge Renfrew when we're

523
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:25,755
conducting the deposition.

524
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,057
It's not fair to the witness.

525
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,627
He hasn't finished his answer.

526
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,996
Please complete your answer
about the Noxae ingredients.

527
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,998
I'd like to call an
end of this for today.

528
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,633
I told you, from
what we analyzed,

529
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:36,633
the ingredients were fine.

530
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,935
If you wish to draw
other conclusions,

531
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,069
get them from someone else.

532
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,004
But you can't just leave.

533
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,439
You're here under a subpoena.

534
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:42,439
Jack, please sit.

535
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,475
I'm assuming you
people have put in the time

536
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,578
to study the analysis, the
results we all gathered.

537
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,113
If you haven't,
you're all fools.

538
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,615
I could get the research and
read it off to you if you like.

539
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,683
Pretty exciting stuff.

540
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,552
Was that a yes or no?

541
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,823
It's a fuck you.

542
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,789
Get yo' ass outta here!

543
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:33,857
What you care?

544
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,792
Leave him be, stalagmite!

545
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,961
Yo, go somewhere else and do
some throw-ups or something.

546
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,796
I'll get Remey to
whoop your ass.

547
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:40,797
Sheeit.

548
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,599
Busta lickin' punk!

549
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,601
Bitch!

550
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:55,278
You all right, mister.

551
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:01,017
Holy shit.

552
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:01,017
Yeah.

553
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,722
You come running out that
building swatting the fuzzy

554
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,590
or something like that.

555
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,992
You're kidding.

556
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:12,729
All I remember is I
was on my feet running.

557
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,999
Now I got this pain in my head.

558
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,202
Starts in your
feet then goes to your head.

559
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,704
Just 'cause you feel it
means your roots aren't dead.

560
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,607
La da Dee, la da da.

561
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:29,145
La da Dee, la da da.

562
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,080
Hey, don't worry.

563
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,715
Nothing's missing.

564
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:33,783
I made sure.

565
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:42,659
Please.

566
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,134
Please.

567
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,307
What?

568
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,975
You in love?

569
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:05,715
My name's Jack.

570
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:10,320
Bazemint.

571
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,288
Bazemint tape.

572
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:12,288
Bazemint tape?

573
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,157
Yeah, what about it?

574
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:14,791
No, no.

575
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,292
Nothing.

576
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,695
A musician, right?

577
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,797
Better believe it.

578
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,233
Well, I want to thank
you for watching over me.

579
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,235
I got to go back to work now.

580
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,704
How'd you know?

581
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,771
What?

582
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,240
I was into music?

583
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,242
Easy... your name.

584
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,716
You going to be
able to keep it real?

585
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:40,917
Yeah.

586
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,119
I just lost myself
a little earlier.

587
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,154
Not normal for me.

588
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,657
Yeah, I know what that's like.

589
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,993
But you know what?

590
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:53,696
There is nothing stranger
than a normal person.

591
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,068
Thank you again, Bazemint.

592
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,204
You're very kind.

593
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,239
Just don't be normal.

594
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,396
Jack, what happened?

595
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:26,396
Nothing.

596
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,332
What are you doing?

597
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,801
Measuring quantities
from the experiment.

598
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,804
I thought I made it clear to
let things be until I returned.

599
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,839
Dr. bleu instructed me
to organize our work.

600
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,441
But look what I found.

601
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,843
Based on the quantities that we
started with and what was left,

602
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,413
60 milliliters were expended.

603
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,682
So it didn't take
much to have an effect.

604
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,450
How much is left?

605
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,053
2.82 liters.

606
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:53,089
That's 92 more applications.

607
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:53,089
Pardon?

608
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,858
The effect diminishes
with time, ram.

609
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,326
We need to make more.

610
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,995
Everything's documented,
so it shouldn't

611
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,064
be a problem to formulate.

612
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,099
What's bleu want
with the information?

613
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,167
He didn't say.

614
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,241
If your eyesight was any better,

615
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,178
you'd be able to
see through people.

616
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,913
What's that supposed to mean?

617
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,014
Your vision's fine, Jack.

618
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,016
Why so testy?

619
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,018
I'm sorry, Hugo.

620
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,019
Everything's hitting at once.

621
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,021
What's new in your department?

622
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,857
We have a few clinical trials
going on for Redfield's group.

623
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,359
One's on lowering
blood glucose levels

624
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,731
with prednisolone acetate,
eye drops for diabetics.

625
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,834
Is there no escaping the wake
of his pharmaceutical swill?

626
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,402
I don't follow.

627
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,738
He's smothering the firewall
between research and commerce.

628
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,741
Ah, it's the times we're in,
Jack, with funding and all.

629
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,976
He's got programs throughout
the county health system,

630
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,279
in the prison system, even
at the state hospital.

631
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,347
Teargarden?

632
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,752
Limited liability risk.

633
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,920
Testing new drugs on the insane.

634
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,756
I didn't say that was going on.

635
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,491
Oh, you don't have to.

636
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,493
It's the Redfield way.

637
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:06,896
Thanks, Hugo.

638
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,009
Jack.

639
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,410
Here, I can't seem to open this.

640
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,980
Come in.

641
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,414
Surprised I'm here, right?

642
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,783
In a church nave, yes.

643
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,851
In my home, not at all.

644
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,287
Well, I appreciate you getting
together on such short notice.

645
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,356
You know, back in my
teens, I experienced

646
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,324
one of the best
flavor sensations ever

647
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:35,324
to hit my tongue.

648
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:40,897
It started with a short crunch
followed by sweetness and then

649
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,299
a zap of slight burning.

650
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:43,299
You continued chewing.

651
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,469
And when the combination
moved further into the mouth,

652
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,872
oh, it was like a wave
of flavor breaking

653
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,140
on the back of my tongue.

654
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:55,111
And now, decades later, I plan
to recapture that experience.

655
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:57,013
French, Vietnamese, Italian?

656
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:57,013
Onion rings.

657
00:36:57,015 --> 00:37:00,049
You know, where the onion
doesn't get lost in the ring

658
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:00,917
but still doesn't overpower it.

659
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,485
I think they're ready.

660
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,554
Right.

661
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:09,292
Now, you and I are
going to experience

662
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:13,129
a little bit of heaven
on this beautiful earth.

663
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,131
There.

664
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:18,434
Your meals always
give faith a good name.

665
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,138
Stuart, something's happened.

666
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:26,142
I can't for the
life of me explain.

667
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,045
There was a lab accident
that affected my eyes.

668
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,379
Your eyesight ok?

669
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:30,379
Yes.

670
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:35,284
I don't know how to tell
you with a straight face.

671
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,387
I'm seeing things.

672
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,890
While I'm awake,
in broad daylight.

673
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,525
You're serious?

674
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,961
I'm dead serious.

675
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:47,897
My dog just passed away.

676
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:52,001
But after the lab
accident, I saw her.

677
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:58,374
She was there, so vivid in the
room, so real it hurt my heart.

678
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,410
I was visiting my mother
in her nursing home.

679
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,914
When I left, I saw an
elderly man in another room.

680
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:08,351
Floating above him, I saw a
younger version of that man.

681
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,653
I was just at a
deposition today.

682
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,090
Sitting opposite me was an
executive I've never met.

683
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,260
Then a separate lurid
vision of him appears.

684
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:20,897
Maybe you have an explanation.

685
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,999
Or am I losing it?

686
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,500
Oh, I know you.

687
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:24,500
You're not crazy.

688
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:30,473
But to see something, you
have to believe in it, right?

689
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,475
I look over there, and I
see an onion, because I

690
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,310
believe it's an onion.

691
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,613
I don't believe in
magic or pious spirits.

692
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,348
Why the visions?

693
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,117
Maybe you need to
approach this phenomenon

694
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,053
in a different manner.

695
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,521
The onion, please.

696
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,690
Go ahead.

697
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,093
Now, forget that you know it's
a bulbous, yellowish, brown

698
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,662
vegetable, ok?

699
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,631
Try to meet it on its own terms.

700
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,366
It's a sphere, right?

701
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,369
Well, look closely.

702
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,672
Look at the bottom
and follow it up.

703
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,241
It's not really a sphere.

704
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:08,044
As a man of science
you might see

705
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:13,249
that it's actually a bloom of
linear vectors pushing upwards.

706
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,318
Now, peel off the outside layer.

707
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,385
Go ahead.

708
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:22,558
Notice how it's dry.

709
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,727
But how dry?

710
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:29,966
It's not of powdered dry or an
old crusty dry that crumbles.

711
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:33,069
No, it's a fresh type of dry.

712
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:36,105
In fact, compared to other
dry things in this world,

713
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:40,509
you could say its dryness
is actually exquisite.

714
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,411
Now, here.

715
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,713
Slice it open.

716
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,981
Go on.

717
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,487
Ah, look at that.

718
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,056
You've opened the
floodgates of being.

719
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,726
Life inside of death.

720
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,028
Now, how do we know it's alive?

721
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,998
Try to put the two
halves back together.

722
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,666
You can't.

723
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:07,036
The pieces of its being
were held under compression,

724
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:09,739
as are all living things.

725
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,541
Now, notice we can't
escape the aroma that

726
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:16,212
fills the air released
from its flowing juices.

727
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,581
Just seconds ago, there
was very little smell.

728
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,183
It was contained in
that exquisite dryness,

729
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:24,520
if you remember.

730
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:27,156
Shit, I'll never look at
an onion the same way again.

731
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,126
When you see one
of those visions,

732
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:33,396
forget any previous associations
that may come into your mind.

733
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:36,198
Focus your consciousness deeply.

734
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,667
Forget what you don't believe.

735
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,736
Look at what it means to you.

736
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,340
You're all fools.

737
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,575
I can get the research and read
it off to you, if you like.

738
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:46,575
Pretty exciting stuff.

739
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:46,575
Would you like me to do that?

740
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:51,180
Because if you
want me to, I will.

741
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:54,383
Was that a yes or no?

742
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,452
It's a fuck you.

743
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,387
Jury profiling begins tomorrow.

744
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,223
Jury selection is
around the corner.

745
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:04,126
And you, our expert
witness, leave

746
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:09,298
a deposition that could lead
to us losing the entire case.

747
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,735
Listen, I'm exhausted.

748
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:15,538
The pressure to produce results
has become almost unbearable.

749
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,573
But I just can't stress
enough the importance

750
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,642
of what we've stumbled
onto, especially

751
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,445
now, because it's
taken a new twist.

752
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,113
What are you
talking about, Jack?

753
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,449
The vision enhancements
have deviated away

754
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:27,451
from odor signatures.

755
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:30,687
What is it?

756
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,622
What are you talking about?

757
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,425
Personality traits.

758
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,695
Scientific results are
governed by perception.

759
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,730
You know this better than
anyone here, Clayton.

760
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,467
A drug is developed
to relieve chest pain.

761
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:44,467
It fails.

762
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:48,437
But someone looked at
that failure differently.

763
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,406
It turns out it inhibits
an enzyme allowing blood

764
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:51,807
to flow to the penis.

765
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,411
It becomes the most
successful drug in history.

766
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,880
Well, what we discovered
in the lab, the ability

767
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,350
to see the aromas a
substance gives off,

768
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,586
has shifted to
the ability to see

769
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:07,123
what an individual emanates.

770
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:11,427
You know how we describe someone
like, he beams confidence,

771
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,762
or, she has a glow about her?

772
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,132
There's now a way that
can actually be seen.

773
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,501
It can be physically observed
and described in detail.

774
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:22,538
Jack.

775
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:29,712
This is a university
biomedical research department.

776
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,882
We have 24 faculty Emeriti
who conduct ongoing research

777
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,252
into cancer, infectious
diseases, physics,

778
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,488
often in collaboration with
the heads of laboratories

779
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,158
and hospitals around the world.

780
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,394
They all stay in high esteem,
because they back up their work

781
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,562
with confirmed experiment.

782
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:51,300
You yourself... you
yourself... loudly

783
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,869
proclaim that magical
thinking can't solve problems.

784
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:57,473
But you continue to
make outrageous claims.

785
00:42:57,475 --> 00:42:59,341
The perception is that
the university's money

786
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,777
and resources are being wasted.

787
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:04,480
I think this has
gotten out of hand.

788
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,482
You're right.

789
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,684
What I've experienced
has to be formalized.

790
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,353
I just wish you could
see it for yourself.

791
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:15,558
Redfield, what's the most
important part of a court

792
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:15,558
trial?

793
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,962
It's happening within
days... jury selection.

794
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,265
Clayton, what do you want
done with this project?

795
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,500
Give me some additional time.

796
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,436
That is no longer an option.

797
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,405
Your dependability has
come into question.

798
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,341
Can you give the baronial
attitude a rest and listen?

799
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,243
Just one day.

800
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:35,911
If I can't show you
something convincing

801
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,813
by the end of tomorrow,
I'll do whatever you want.

802
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:37,813
End the research.

803
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,915
Give it to someone
else to continue.

804
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,983
Anything.

805
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:44,353
Come on, Clayton.

806
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,359
24 hours.

807
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,332
Do you see this button here?

808
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:59,668
When you push it, it will
be similar to the burst

809
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,371
of air you get when an
optometrist tests for glaucoma.

810
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,472
Clever Medina.

811
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,274
Now there won't be any waste.

812
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,609
Thanks to Dr. Machado.

813
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,444
Do I have enough for
three or four applications?

814
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:09,845
Easily.

815
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,648
Ram added the solution to
this small capsule here.

816
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,683
Be sure everything is recorded.

817
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,719
Got it.

818
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:20,389
This enhancement in your
vision you described...

819
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,457
Why the sudden change?

820
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,891
Did something happen at home?

821
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,799
It's strange, ram.

822
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,967
I was working.

823
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,302
I dozed off.

824
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,371
I woke up.

825
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:36,772
Then I saw sunny-girl.

826
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:37,840
Sunny-girl?

827
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:41,610
Perhaps there is an
additional factor

828
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,713
we are not considering...
The mix of our emotions

829
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:44,713
and consciousness.

830
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:49,418
We work in the representational
world defined by formulas.

831
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,820
Yes, emotions can be an
obstacle to rational thought.

832
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,822
But we also know
extreme emotional grief

833
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,691
affects every part of the body.

834
00:44:55,693 --> 00:45:00,029
Stress can alter
the body chemistry.

835
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,665
You're getting at what happens
with something like serotonin.

836
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,600
Serious bereavement can
cause serotonin levels

837
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:04,600
in the brain to drop.

838
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:08,337
Hallucinations are associated
with neurotransmitter

839
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,005
disturbances.

840
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,541
Not a hallucination.

841
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,610
The brain is more than
electrical and chemical

842
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:18,480
reactions operating
in a chunk of meat.

843
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,848
Consciousness is also in there.

844
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,885
And this combination helped
to alter your perception

845
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:27,089
from enhanced
observations... fragrances...

846
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:31,894
To informed visions.

847
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:36,965
Objective, persistent,
and timeless... those

848
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,068
are the principles any
phenomenon needs to be held to.

849
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,471
If your theory holds
up with those in mind,

850
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,573
I'm willing to pass through
any doors of perception

851
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,075
you're attempting to open.

852
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,810
Yes, Jack.

853
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:51,714
But we must also remember the
lesson that you taught us.

854
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:53,982
Honor the elders,
embrace the new,

855
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,919
and applaud the impracticable.

856
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,387
Let's keep thinking about it.

857
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:00,456
I've got to go.

858
00:46:32,522 --> 00:46:33,689
Hi.

859
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:33,689
I'm Dr. Jack Sutree.

860
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:37,526
I work with Dr. Redfield in
the university biosciences

861
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:38,160
department.

862
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:38,894
Trixie Tao.

863
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,696
A pleasure.

864
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,064
Is Dr. Redfield attending today?

865
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:43,599
No.

866
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,734
I'm here to observe
the jury profiling.

867
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,069
Why is that?

868
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,104
I'm going to note any
characteristics that

869
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,706
may not be obvious to others.

870
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:54,009
Hopefully it will provide
some help for your process.

871
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,745
I assure you we don't need
any assistance in what we do.

872
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:56,745
Oh, I understand.

873
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:02,451
It's sort of research for a
new approach Dr. Redfield wants

874
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:03,919
to explore.

875
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,821
Do you have a way
different from ours

876
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,656
to predict whether or not
a prospective juror may

877
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,625
be dangerous to a case?

878
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:12,528
Because we already cover
life experiences, predisposed

879
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,163
attitudes, and believes.

880
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:17,099
We go below the surface.

881
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:18,600
Let's just say our
approach focuses

882
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,670
on what's behind the person.

883
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,540
Is there an area where
I'll be out of the way?

884
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:25,774
Through that door.

885
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,743
There's a small room
with a one-way glass.

886
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:29,044
You'll have all the
privacy you need.

887
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,879
Thanks Ms. Tao.

888
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,581
Here.

889
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,583
These are the
evaluation guidelines

890
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,653
that our social scientists have
developed for each candidate.

891
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,087
I'll make notes for each one.

892
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:42,825
Knock yourself out.

893
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:46,795
So as I was saying...

894
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,820
What do you feel is
important about having laws?

895
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,188
Everyone knows laws
were established

896
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,657
for people's own good.

897
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,527
It's dangerous when
laws are not obeyed.

898
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,896
Is there ever a time when
the law should not be obeyed?

899
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:20,896
Never.

900
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:26,235
If people don't obey the law,
we would have total chaos.

901
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,504
Whoa.

902
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:39,715
Someone implies something
about you that is not true.

903
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,183
How does that affect you?

904
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:42,551
It doesn't.

905
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:45,120
It doesn't affect me at all.

906
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:48,257
We can't help it if someone
gets the wrong idea about us.

907
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,858
Hmm.

908
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,560
Can we help it if someone
says something about us

909
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:54,963
that isn't true?

910
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,066
Which us president
do you admire most?

911
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,670
Why, our current president.

912
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:02,672
Oh, really?

913
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,648
Have you ever worked as a
janitor, been a business owner,

914
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,016
or worked in a hospital?

915
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:18,086
In college, I worked
part time as a janitor.

916
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,622
Well, that's refreshing.

917
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,624
Do you play the lottery?

918
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,026
That's one vice
that I don't have.

919
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:27,996
You sure about that?

920
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,970
Do you feel drugs
should be legalized?

921
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:35,972
They already are.

922
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,710
What do you expect
when, as you're

923
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,111
approaching a parking
spot, another car

924
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,813
races by and takes it?

925
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:53,055
The driver is in
the wrong to do that.

926
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:56,191
And it makes me angry.

927
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:00,596
Thank you.

928
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:03,732
Candidate 14, please.

929
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,103
What was the name of
the last book you read?

930
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,348
"Four past midnight."

931
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:24,119
Thank you.

932
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:27,990
Roger?

933
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:28,624
Roger.

934
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:31,093
Call 911.

935
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:51,179
What happened?

936
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,082
You passed out and were
rushed to the hospital.

937
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,752
No.

938
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,821
What happened to us?

939
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,356
Your walking shoes.

940
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,959
For a moment, I thought
we were back in Paris.

941
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,827
Rest, Jack.

942
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,330
You're still out there.

943
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:12,234
Could you close
that cabinet drawer?

944
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:15,303
Now you're back.

945
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,705
Mm.

946
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:17,706
I'm serious, Mel.

947
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,041
What happened to us?

948
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,314
Answers would be nice.

949
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:33,155
I'm just busy doing other
things now, just like you.

950
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,826
Hi, I'm Jim Erlandson.

951
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:38,460
Mrs. Sutree?

952
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,828
Yes.

953
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,129
Mr.
Sutree, I understand

954
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,831
you were at a jury
selection procedure.

955
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,067
Why were you there?

956
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,868
I'm an expert witness in a case.

957
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,337
Was there any stress
or trauma that occurred

958
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,372
during the process?

959
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:51,707
None, no.

960
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:53,141
What about at work?

961
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:56,311
Would you say the stress
level there is above normal?

962
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,013
Where you going
with this, doctor?

963
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:00,248
I'm a boring research
scientist at cu.

964
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,784
You appear to be a
normally healthy individual.

965
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:07,355
But your cortisol...
18, no more than 23

966
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:10,258
micrograms per deciliter is ok.

967
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,394
You came in here at over 50.

968
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:12,394
Really?

969
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:14,162
What is it now?

970
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:14,930
It's ok.

971
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:14,930
You're normal.

972
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:17,966
It's just if it had stayed
that high, it would have

973
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,968
started attacking your brain.

974
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,304
Eventually you would have
gone into cardiac shock.

975
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:29,845
Look, does your work expose
you to drugs or stimulants?

976
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:30,846
Cut the crap.

977
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:32,047
We don't abuse our privileges.

978
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:33,281
Jack.

979
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,150
Ok.

980
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,353
You need to review your
last few days for anything

981
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,922
unusual, anything
you reacted to,

982
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:44,459
anything that caused
emotional distress.

983
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:47,162
Because if what happened
today happens again,

984
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,265
your wife is going to
visit you on a slab.

985
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,867
He came in
like Dr. Jekyll.

986
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:52,768
But wouldn't you know?

987
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,069
He's Mr. Hyde.

988
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:56,138
Could you hand me my phone?

989
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:03,545
What happened today?

990
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,148
I've stumbled onto
something, Mel.

991
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,148
I don't understand it all yet.

992
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:12,020
But it seems to be something
that will make some noise

993
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,256
and change things.

994
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:16,558
You are lying in a hospital
bed with your vital signs

995
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:16,558
on display.

996
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,493
Haven't things changed enough?

997
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,528
He said I'm fine.

998
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,530
What's on the other side?

999
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,168
I'm not chasing
the cat this time.

1000
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,903
Your work is removed
from real life.

1001
00:53:35,144 --> 00:53:38,914
And I know what happened to us.

1002
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,949
Your work removed you
from our marriage.

1003
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,851
Dr. Sutree?

1004
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,920
Hold on, ram.

1005
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:48,323
Why do you do it?

1006
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,528
I guess for the same reasons
you and I walk together

1007
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,864
along the left bank.

1008
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:56,866
It's exciting.

1009
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,269
And it makes me happy.

1010
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,408
Sorry, ram.

1011
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,412
Sutree showed up during
jury profiling yesterday.

1012
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,313
Why?

1013
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:11,313
How would I know?

1014
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:15,250
He became sick and
was hospitalized.

1015
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:15,951
What?

1016
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:16,484
What happened?

1017
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:16,484
Where is he?

1018
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:17,986
Oh, he's discharged.

1019
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,226
We should think
about shifting gears.

1020
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,161
He has good predocs
working with him.

1021
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:27,443
We should put them
to better use.

1022
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:49,618
There's a decline effect, ram.

1023
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,219
How do you mean?

1024
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,355
I lost the ability to
see into people yesterday.

1025
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:54,890
Even after repeated
applications,

1026
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:57,058
the effect never came back.

1027
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,194
And I've run out of time.

1028
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:02,464
Any idea what
might have changed?

1029
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,367
The effect first
happened within an hour,

1030
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,602
when we were driving.

1031
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,538
It came back later that
evening at the restaurant.

1032
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,407
And then when I went home,
I experienced it again.

1033
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:12,407
No.

1034
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,309
No, it went away at that point.

1035
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,977
I could no longer see aromas.

1036
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,447
The condition progressed
to the visions.

1037
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:23,485
I still think it's related to
one subjective consciousness.

1038
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,221
Emotion was part of it.

1039
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:30,058
The first vision was sunny-girl.

1040
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,160
But the man at the
nursing home, the lawyer,

1041
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,995
the deposition, the
jury pool... none of them

1042
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:34,963
meant anything to me.

1043
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:35,597
No, no, Jack.

1044
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,965
The trigger.

1045
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,566
I'm talking about
a triggering agent.

1046
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,169
It sets things in motion.

1047
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,439
You were so distressed when we
scattered sunny-girl's ashes.

1048
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,314
Sunny-girl.

1049
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:55,250
Ram, sunny-girl.

1050
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:56,252
Billion-year-old carbon.

1051
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:01,156
The song?

1052
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,394
Hey, you tell your students
that using your formula app

1053
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,295
is cheating.

1054
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,264
It's my app.

1055
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,565
Sweet app.

1056
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,434
The most important
element in life.

1057
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:14,302
The thing that ties
everything together.

1058
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,504
It was added when her
ashes flew into my eyes.

1059
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,673
After a few hours, it
altered the effect.

1060
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,541
Bazinga!

1061
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,109
Ashes!

1062
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,377
Activated carbon.

1063
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,678
A purifying agent.

1064
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,281
I'll wager my life it's
the triggering agent.

1065
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:28,083
Billion-year-old carbon!

1066
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,150
Yes!

1067
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,191
Careful.

1068
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:38,259
It's super... get it
all on the plastic.

1069
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,431
Go ahead.

1070
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:47,402
Ok.

1071
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:10,392
Ok, here we go.

1072
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,769
Are you ok?

1073
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,704
Wow.

1074
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:23,706
It feels robust.

1075
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:41,089
Damn.

1076
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:43,058
Too many variables are at work.

1077
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,161
We need a subject to
properly document this,

1078
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:49,497
or it remains a theorem
without any proof.

1079
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:51,666
The psychology department
has the biggest research pool.

1080
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,334
Do you want me to get
someone from there?

1081
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:00,742
No.

1082
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,277
I have someone in mind.

1083
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:10,285
I'll be back.

1084
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:06,708
Listen, mister.

1085
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,344
I don't turn tricks, if that's
why you wanted to meet me.

1086
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:11,479
No, no, nothing like that.

1087
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,381
I'm from cu.

1088
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,883
Speak English.

1089
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,252
The university down the road.

1090
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:19,854
You a teacher?

1091
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,789
More of a scientist.

1092
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:22,757
Bioscience.

1093
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,360
I study ways to improve life.

1094
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:26,628
Look around here.

1095
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,530
You got your work cut
out for you, playa.

1096
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:38,773
Those supposed to mean you cool?

1097
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:40,842
What, these?

1098
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:45,246
You may be a
professor, but you in

1099
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,649
need of some serious
streetcreducation.

1100
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,817
Do you remember when you
helped me the other day?

1101
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,921
Yeah, when you was running
like a mad scientist?

1102
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,889
Very good, yes.

1103
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:59,527
Well, you struck me as a
possible subject for our study.

1104
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,829
You want to study Bazemint?

1105
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,831
What for?

1106
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:04,899
I'll be honest.

1107
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,768
I don't know.

1108
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:11,673
But when we first
met, I saw potential.

1109
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:14,609
And I think there's
value in pursuing that.

1110
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,912
Are you sure you're
not trying to mingle me?

1111
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,414
Mingle you?

1112
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,650
Yeah, because I don't do that.

1113
01:00:25,554 --> 01:00:27,989
Anymore.

1114
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,792
Look, I'm not planning
any tricks here.

1115
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:34,896
I assure you my intentions
are strictly scientific.

1116
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:35,898
And the cheese?

1117
01:00:41,403 --> 01:00:43,483
I can get you a couple
hundred dollars for your time.

1118
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:51,613
What you looking
for, professor Jack?

1119
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:53,982
That, Bazemint,
is precisely what I

1120
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,350
hope you can help me find out.

1121
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,891
This gonna be on YouTube?

1122
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,261
Scientific experiment or
cat video... I wonder which

1123
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:08,930
will get more hits.

1124
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:09,972
Y'all got al-Gore-rhythms?

1125
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,803
Algorithms?

1126
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,505
Yes, we use them.

1127
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,507
That shit really
gone change the world?

1128
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:23,311
They already have, for sure.

1129
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,280
What's your name again?

1130
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,381
Ram.

1131
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:28,583
You named after a goat?

1132
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:29,851
My full name is ramble.

1133
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,620
You named after a
goat taking a stroll?

1134
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,389
My father's name
is Penku Tambel.

1135
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:34,389
He's a big Creedence fan.

1136
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:37,358
So he named me after
his favorite song,

1137
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,927
"ramble tamble," except mine
is spelled with an e-l, not

1138
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:40,595
an l-e.

1139
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:41,963
Jeez Louise.

1140
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,865
Sorry I asked.

1141
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:47,068
We're all set, Jack.

1142
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,604
You ready?

1143
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:51,039
What I'm supposed to do?

1144
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,573
Just relax.

1145
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:50,898
You all right?

1146
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,002
I don't know what
it is about you.

1147
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,671
Yeah, I get that a lot.

1148
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:01,943
How does it look, ram?

1149
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,878
There is a lot here, Jack.

1150
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,881
The good news... your
heart rate stayed normal.

1151
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,150
You were never at risk.

1152
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,685
Are you all right?

1153
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:11,686
Yeah.

1154
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:14,589
Was that ok?

1155
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:17,759
Why did you hold my shoulder?

1156
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:20,027
You looked like you needed help.

1157
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:24,399
Did I screw up already?

1158
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:25,533
No.

1159
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,168
No, you were fine.

1160
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,804
We've had a good start.

1161
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,707
I need to study what we
did here before we do more.

1162
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:35,042
Can I call upon
you in another day

1163
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:37,645
or so to do another session?

1164
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,713
Ok.

1165
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:46,053
But I need something else.

1166
01:04:05,774 --> 01:04:08,609
Well, my funds are limited.

1167
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:09,744
Don't trip off that.

1168
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:12,180
I don't want more cheese.

1169
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:16,684
I want you to find
someone for me.

1170
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,754
Find someone?

1171
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:22,223
That's not what we do.

1172
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,525
But you full of
science swag here.

1173
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:24,525
I mean, look around.

1174
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:29,197
You got some serious,
ginormous science swag.

1175
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,799
We wouldn't be the best
people to help locate someone.

1176
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,935
I don't even know
where to begin.

1177
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:35,536
You a scientist?

1178
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,038
Yes.

1179
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,141
You a scientist,
in a big-ass school.

1180
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:42,610
And you got
al-Gore-rhythms, right?

1181
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,545
Algorithms, correct.

1182
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,713
Listen.

1183
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,848
You got computers.

1184
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:46,848
You got a way to do it.

1185
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:50,518
No one else has ever cared
to help me with this.

1186
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,588
There are missing persons
organizations that can help.

1187
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,690
Don't you think I
seen them already?

1188
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:56,824
They couldn't do nothing.

1189
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:59,794
It's different if
you give it a try.

1190
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:02,497
Look, you says you
want to improve life.

1191
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:04,632
Start with me.

1192
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:05,967
Start with this life.

1193
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:15,977
I can't promise we'll
succeed, but I tell you what.

1194
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:18,646
We'll give it a shot.

1195
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,748
Who do you want to find?

1196
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,585
Well, it's hard to
talk about, because it

1197
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,853
ain't no one's business.

1198
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:26,855
It's your mother.

1199
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:36,764
How did you know i... I want
to know where's my mama?

1200
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,132
Is she still in the area?

1201
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,134
Did she move away?

1202
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:45,239
It's been so long.

1203
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:50,077
And she was always sick.

1204
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:54,148
But I think she's around here.

1205
01:05:57,085 --> 01:05:59,020
Can you help me find her?

1206
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:00,022
We'll try.

1207
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:04,292
Thank you.

1208
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:08,129
Professor Jack, when
you were staring at me,

1209
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,997
what did you see?

1210
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,422
I still need more time
to understand things.

1211
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:20,141
But I can tell you this.

1212
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,677
Don't ever deny yourself and
your ability to do things,

1213
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,313
Bazemint.

1214
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,815
You know your
friend from dinner?

1215
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,916
Brenda?

1216
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:28,916
Yes.

1217
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,819
She's working with the
county health administration.

1218
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,721
Ask if she can check
if Bazemint's mom ever

1219
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,591
turned up in the system.

1220
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:37,592
What is her name?

1221
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,660
Nina.

1222
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,262
Nina Orleans.

1223
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:45,066
And what name did
your mother give you?

1224
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,268
Simone.

1225
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,203
Simone.

1226
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:56,143
Redfield.

1227
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,945
Dr.
Redfield, it's Trixie Tao.

1228
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,313
We had enhanced
background checks done

1229
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,781
on all the prospective jurors.

1230
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,216
It's unbelievable.

1231
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:03,851
What's unbelievable?

1232
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,252
I'd understand

1233
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,154
if he was correct about
two, maybe three, people.

1234
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:07,154
That's the norm.

1235
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,858
But he was spot on with
every single person.

1236
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,793
We've never seen that before.

1237
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:13,928
Details, Ms. Tao.

1238
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,197
Who is he?

1239
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,265
Your
colleague, Dr. sutree.

1240
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:20,167
He flagged several of
the potential jurors

1241
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:22,403
as not trustworthy
before he became ill.

1242
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,405
They all had passed the
initial standard screening

1243
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,140
that was done.

1244
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,109
But when we went back and fed
the info into our new security

1245
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:31,012
tap, six of the individuals
had enough in their backgrounds

1246
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:32,947
to make them ineligible.

1247
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:34,715
I just sent the results to you.

1248
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,850
By the way, how is he?

1249
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:37,318
I need to contact him.

1250
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,387
Do you know what this means
for any challenge that

1251
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,721
ends up in front of a jury?

1252
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,689
Yeah, don't worry.

1253
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:42,923
I'll set something up.

1254
01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:48,429
Here's what we came up with.

1255
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:51,032
There is a Nina
Orleans in the system.

1256
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,968
Committed to Teargarden
15 years ago.

1257
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,302
An addict.

1258
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,738
Apparently the addiction
took her over the edge.

1259
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,407
She had a daughter.

1260
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,809
And the daughter was taken
away and placed in foster care.

1261
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:02,877
That's who we're looking for!

1262
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:03,978
Is she still there?

1263
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,846
Oh, there's an issue
with Teargarden.

1264
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,815
They've never kept good records.

1265
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,150
They've since cleaned house.

1266
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:12,386
About five years ago,
the times ran an expose.

1267
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,089
Unfortunately, there's a
gap in the information.

1268
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,991
Is there another
place we can look?

1269
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:18,859
Well, I would suggest
going right there.

1270
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,929
There's piles of
handwritten case records

1271
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,098
that have never been entered.

1272
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,367
I wouldn't know where
to begin to look.

1273
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,102
Oh, I can help you with that.

1274
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,837
Brenda, I wanted to let you know

1275
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,005
how wonderful it
is that you have

1276
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:33,307
been of such great assistance.

1277
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:36,777
I'll call Blythe Bowlby,
and I'll set everything up.

1278
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,245
John can accompany you.

1279
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,047
He is familiar with
the data interface,

1280
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,749
and he'll know
who to speak with.

1281
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,284
Great.

1282
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:46,153
And thank you very
much for the gift, ram.

1283
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:47,855
You're very welcome.

1284
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,457
It says it all, doesn't it?

1285
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,225
Predocs work so many
hours in the day

1286
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:52,727
that we're always pooped.

1287
01:09:00,168 --> 01:09:02,203
So what kind of
music you into, man?

1288
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:04,472
I really don't know how
that is of importance.

1289
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,973
It can be.

1290
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,475
Depending.

1291
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,143
Depending on?

1292
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,078
Well, when I slam
through coding,

1293
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:15,116
listening to grizzly bear helps.

1294
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,484
But that's an exception.

1295
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,786
I don't like lame-stream.

1296
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:20,354
Fascinating.

1297
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:23,290
Or when I'm clubbing, MC
boy, "transmission of love."

1298
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:26,527
I like something more intense.

1299
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,196
These groups don't play
at the clubs near campus.

1300
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:29,196
Not here.

1301
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,866
At hung Lo's, on the Westside.

1302
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:35,469
Never heard of it.

1303
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,005
You should check
it out some time.

1304
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,941
If you're into guys.

1305
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,343
What?

1306
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,979
What would make you say
something like that to me?

1307
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:46,781
Hung Lo's, it's
a gay club I like.

1308
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:51,952
Oh.

1309
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,921
I'm so happy.

1310
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,157
I thought you were talking
about that Chinese restaurant,

1311
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,358
hung Lao's.

1312
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,292
No.

1313
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,361
No, hung lo.

1314
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,563
It's a place to get
down and let loose.

1315
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:03,264
Get loose.

1316
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:06,901
Would you like to hear a
song I'm thinking in my head?

1317
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:09,203
She's not your girlfriend.

1318
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,271
She's not your girlfriend.

1319
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:11,038
It's ok, man.

1320
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,107
Relax.

1321
01:10:18,246 --> 01:10:19,547
Gentlemen, please come this way.

1322
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:35,830
That's mine.

1323
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:36,497
That's mine.

1324
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:38,499
It's mine.

1325
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:40,968
Thank you.

1326
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:41,468
No problem.

1327
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,537
Thank you.

1328
01:10:47,475 --> 01:10:48,475
Gentlemen.

1329
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,249
You see that row
of records here?

1330
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,619
Our people went through them in
preparation for digitization.

1331
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:03,090
We did not find any records of
what happened to Nina Orleans.

1332
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,192
Nothing.

1333
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,428
What was most
likely her outcome?

1334
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,363
Most likely, she
wasn't discharged.

1335
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,899
That rarely has happened.

1336
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,268
She probably passed on.

1337
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,537
She was pretty bad off.

1338
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:20,274
Someone in her condition
doesn't have a long life.

1339
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,377
I'm sorry I couldn't have more
definitive news or happier news

1340
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,413
for that matter.

1341
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,449
It's ok.

1342
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:30,384
Thank you for your
generous time.

1343
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,186
Anything to help Brenda's group.

1344
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:34,955
Her modernization of the
state's health services system

1345
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,590
is most appreciated.

1346
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,093
Some people were here for
years, and no one even

1347
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:40,160
knew who they were.

1348
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:48,969
You lose your mind.

1349
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,204
They lose your identity.

1350
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:52,139
This suck... oh, sorry, dude.

1351
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:52,606
It's ok.

1352
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,941
It's ok.

1353
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:56,310
She might be with
the lost souls.

1354
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,212
What's that, my friend?

1355
01:11:58,214 --> 01:12:02,082
She might be with
the lost souls.

1356
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,084
Well put.

1357
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,924
Downstairs, in
the library of ash.

1358
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:17,965
It used to be, when someone
died here at Teargarden,

1359
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:22,236
sometimes there was
no one to claim them.

1360
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:25,339
They were cremated.

1361
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,642
And their remains
were stored here.

1362
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:32,012
Those are the lost souls.

1363
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,049
In the cans.

1364
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:36,331
They call it the library of ash.

1365
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:46,060
This is extraordinarily
generous, Clayton.

1366
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:46,660
I don't understand.

1367
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:47,962
How is this possible?

1368
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:49,730
There's a sword
of Damocles hanging

1369
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:53,200
over the entire
pharmaceutical industry.

1370
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,501
It's being kept quiet.

1371
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,705
But the therapeutic
power of drugs

1372
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:01,976
has been steadily waning
for several years now.

1373
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:04,979
We're losing the battle
to help the mind, William.

1374
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:07,348
There's a worldwide scramble
for the next psychoactive.

1375
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:11,352
Yes, but how does this
tie into Jack's research.

1376
01:13:11,354 --> 01:13:16,590
He may have stumbled onto a
gateway to a major advancement.

1377
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,395
Please, sit, Dr. sutree.

1378
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:30,004
You and I are
alike in some ways.

1379
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:34,108
We both started with a childhood
fascination with the sciences.

1380
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,176
It came from observing
the things in life

1381
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,579
that are full of whimsy.

1382
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:43,217
It's very seductive,
especially to a young mind.

1383
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:46,754
And you and I, unlike
the average Joe,

1384
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:50,057
we took things a step further.

1385
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:54,795
We observed the whimsical, but
we backed it up with facts.

1386
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,398
That's what science is.

1387
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,235
So here's where we are.

1388
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:03,237
I've secured all the
funding you'll ever

1389
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,807
need to continue your research.

1390
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:10,177
You'll have the time and
the supplies required.

1391
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,413
What's he mean, Billy?

1392
01:14:12,415 --> 01:14:13,415
It's right here, Jack.

1393
01:14:16,384 --> 01:14:17,684
It's the largest
amount ever granted

1394
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,053
in the history of
this department.

1395
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:27,127
But because of the,
let's say, mercurial

1396
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:32,366
behavior that's been reported,
there are conditions.

1397
01:14:32,368 --> 01:14:33,734
Ah.

1398
01:14:33,736 --> 01:14:35,803
Conditions.

1399
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,372
Does it matter?

1400
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:41,175
You practically have carte
Blanche to finally understand

1401
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:43,177
what you discovered.

1402
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:45,279
But where does this lead?

1403
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:47,781
What's the end result, Redfield?

1404
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:50,150
Everything will be
under your direction.

1405
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,452
You will receive full credit.

1406
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,091
Who owns the polio vaccine?

1407
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:58,392
What?

1408
01:14:58,394 --> 01:15:00,627
The polio vaccine...
Who owns the patent?

1409
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:02,396
No one.

1410
01:15:02,398 --> 01:15:04,131
It wasn't for filling
the coffers of some giant

1411
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,132
multinational.

1412
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:06,834
It was given to the world.

1413
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,402
And it made the
world a better place.

1414
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:14,608
You know, for such a brilliant
man, you can be very naive.

1415
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,111
That's occurred because
it was determined

1416
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:19,613
that the national foundation
for infantile paralysis

1417
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,616
could not obtain a patent.

1418
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:25,752
The real irony is that
Jonas Salk's discovery

1419
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:30,190
would have benefited man even
more if it had been patented.

1420
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,627
Why does every discovery have
to be motivated by a cash grab?

1421
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:35,195
Jonathan swift said it best.

1422
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,230
Money is useful.

1423
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:39,600
Love of it, hazardous.

1424
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:41,502
There's nothing new here, Jack.

1425
01:15:41,504 --> 01:15:43,337
You know this is
the way it works.

1426
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:48,142
Your hero, swift... you know
he had Meniere's disease.

1427
01:15:48,144 --> 01:15:51,245
Untreatable in his day.

1428
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:53,313
Now we have meclizine
and Diazepam

1429
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:54,715
to help people cope with it.

1430
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:58,619
There's no denying drugs
have benefited mankind.

1431
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:02,489
But I've been in the trenches
of your broad marketplace,

1432
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,726
the nursing homes where your
miracle drugs are administered.

1433
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,461
You know what?

1434
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:09,196
It's not working out too well.

1435
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,932
We have zombies lying
in hospital beds.

1436
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:14,301
Basic cable their caregiver.

1437
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,537
Those poor people.

1438
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:20,474
Desires that have been neutered.

1439
01:16:20,476 --> 01:16:22,809
The system has become a
legitimized Pablo Escobar,

1440
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:26,246
and you unflinchingly supply
them, because it's big money.

1441
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:30,551
You've replaced cups of
hot tea and warm kisses

1442
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:32,853
with millions of plastic
pill organizers demanding

1443
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:32,853
to be filled.

1444
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:35,856
What really caused
the great social shift

1445
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:35,856
that we have witnessed?

1446
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:40,260
It's time the windfalls were
more human and less financial.

1447
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,528
Don't avoid the question.

1448
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:44,965
Who put all the
people in the homes?

1449
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:46,833
The families.

1450
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:53,574
Brothers, sisters, aunts,
uncles, and the children.

1451
01:16:53,576 --> 01:16:55,976
They are the reason
for the avalanche

1452
01:16:55,978 --> 01:17:01,448
that has uncontrollably spilled
into countless rest homes.

1453
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,883
But you will never
in a million years

1454
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:05,419
find an individual
snowflake ever

1455
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:09,256
taking responsibility for
their part in that avalanche.

1456
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:16,296
You have a mother in a
nursing home, don't you?

1457
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:23,237
Can't go crying to your
mommy about this letdown.

1458
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:29,343
You, Dr. sutree, are one
sorry, sanctimonious snowflake.

1459
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:30,944
Jack, don't!

1460
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,980
Don't, Jack!

1461
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,549
You, sir, have just assaulted
a university board member.

1462
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,426
Your boy.

1463
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,452
Hi, Mel.

1464
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:15,822
My car just stranded me about
a half mile from our place.

1465
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:17,758
I know we agreed to
our separate spaces,

1466
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,926
but I got to stop by and get
something out of the garage.

1467
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,728
I promise I'll leave
as soon as I'm done.

1468
01:19:02,737 --> 01:19:04,504
[Music - Marie Baraton
and Pierre Andre Athane,

1469
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:09,609
["a Paris les Jours sans"]

1470
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:40,674
I'm done, Mel.

1471
01:19:40,676 --> 01:19:43,610
I've lost everything.

1472
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,978
What?

1473
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,681
Maybe the job.

1474
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:48,782
The discovery.

1475
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,851
My colleagues.

1476
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:58,492
I remember when I
visited Notre dame.

1477
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:00,460
We had the sight of the
cathedral on our right.

1478
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,096
And on the left, we
crossed a bridge.

1479
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:05,832
And we ended up on
the ILE Saint-Louis.

1480
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:07,401
And further down
on the left, you

1481
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:10,404
took me to the best
crepe shop I have ever

1482
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:12,139
been to, filled with locals.

1483
01:20:16,544 --> 01:20:21,548
Neither one of us knew anything
about where to eat in Paris.

1484
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,184
But you had a sense, Jack.

1485
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:28,522
You had a natural
instinct about things.

1486
01:20:28,524 --> 01:20:31,658
I don't know, you followed
the sense in the air

1487
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,027
and tracked the
movements of the locals.

1488
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,630
You observed the looks on
the faces of the people

1489
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:38,498
exiting the bistros.

1490
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,135
And you processed all
of that to discover

1491
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:44,938
exactly the right
places for us to go to.

1492
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:50,043
Who wouldn't fall in
love with a scientist who

1493
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,946
could muster his
abilities to provide

1494
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:54,108
his woman with a decent meal?

1495
01:20:58,553 --> 01:20:59,619
Who wouldn't fall in love?

1496
01:21:50,905 --> 01:21:52,973
Thanks.

1497
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:58,979
Still there.

1498
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:02,148
My other charger's in the Alfa.

1499
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:04,050
Your Alfa Naufrago.

1500
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:06,653
You finally ready to get
rid of that hunk of metal?

1501
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:07,821
Hey.

1502
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:10,290
I always like things
that look good.

1503
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:18,064
Any relapses from the other day?

1504
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:19,066
It's under control.

1505
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,973
You saw the dresser.

1506
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:30,644
You're not crawling the walls.

1507
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:32,245
There's hope for mankind yet.

1508
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,880
If we're lucky.

1509
01:23:44,251 --> 01:23:46,152
Forget the rumors.

1510
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:47,754
We are not ceasing
operation of this lab.

1511
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,291
The department feels that,
even with Dr. Sutree's absence,

1512
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:54,694
the importance of the work
demands that we continue.

1513
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,697
The last thing any of us want
is for the research community

1514
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:01,301
to perceive that we
have dropped the ball.

1515
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:03,803
Ram, call me when you hear this.

1516
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:04,938
I'll be visiting my mother.

1517
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,406
Thanks.

1518
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:09,009
What's that on the
board over there?

1519
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:10,710
Ram.

1520
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,212
We formalized
what Dr, sutree was

1521
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:15,081
doing at the time
of the lab accident.

1522
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:18,118
This formula is for a gaseous
substance that he created.

1523
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,754
Once it distilled, it
cooled into a liquid.

1524
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:24,424
Was the liquid used to coat
special lenses or something

1525
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:24,424
like that?

1526
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:28,695
Dr. sutree applied the
liquid directly into his eyes.

1527
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:32,265
Where's this liquid now?

1528
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:33,433
It's gone.

1529
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,035
It used to be in the cabinet.

1530
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,874
Any idea who might
have taken it?

1531
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:44,377
We know it wasn't Dr. sutree,
because the door is open.

1532
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:46,012
I don't follow.

1533
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:48,915
He can't stand anything
left open... doors, drawers,

1534
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,084
or anything out of its place.

1535
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,319
This is a backup
pair of the goggle

1536
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:55,822
we developed as a delivery
mechanism for the liquid.

1537
01:24:55,824 --> 01:25:00,026
They're used to apply small
dosage directly onto the eyes.

1538
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,361
How long before it takes effect?

1539
01:25:01,363 --> 01:25:03,730
Within an hour.

1540
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:05,265
Here's what I want
the both of you to do.

1541
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:07,901
Immediately create a
new batch of liquid.

1542
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:11,004
Follow the formula and
procedures exactly.

1543
01:25:11,006 --> 01:25:14,074
I take it you have all
the necessary supplies.

1544
01:25:14,076 --> 01:25:15,742
Actually, it's ready to go.

1545
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:17,210
Then we'll have
something by day's end.

1546
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:18,278
Agreed?

1547
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,280
Ok.

1548
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:23,850
If you need help or anything
else, just ring me up.

1549
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,819
Sabahu al-Khayer.

1550
01:25:25,821 --> 01:25:28,054
Alaikum wa salam.

1551
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,456
Mr. Tambel.

1552
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:30,957
Could I have a word
with you, please?

1553
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,763
I understand you and Dr.
Sutree had a close working

1554
01:25:36,765 --> 01:25:37,964
relationship.

1555
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:38,932
I guess so.

1556
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:41,201
He's been very supportive.

1557
01:25:41,203 --> 01:25:43,803
You're near the completion
of your doctorate.

1558
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,472
I want you to know
there is no reason

1559
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:47,874
to be concerned with
any interruptions that

1560
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,342
might impede your goal.

1561
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,945
You have the full support
of this department.

1562
01:25:51,947 --> 01:25:54,848
That is very much appreciated.

1563
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:59,753
So the department can depend
on a 100% commitment from you.

1564
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:02,889
105%.

1565
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,958
Good day, Mr. Tambel.

1566
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,960
Keep up the good work.

1567
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:15,101
What did he want?

1568
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:18,772
Directions to Nambla.

1569
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,173
Mr. sutree?

1570
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:53,873
Morning.

1571
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,142
Where is she?

1572
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:58,478
We left so many messages.

1573
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,480
I'm so sorry.

1574
01:27:20,267 --> 01:27:22,402
When?

1575
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:24,904
She was extremely
nauseated and experiencing

1576
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,607
a great deal of pain the
day before yesterday.

1577
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,577
Her feet and ankles
were swollen.

1578
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:34,547
Dr. Walters here rushed
her to the hospital.

1579
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:36,216
It was her chronic infection.

1580
01:27:36,218 --> 01:27:41,187
It finally shut down her
kidneys, and that was it.

1581
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:45,892
If it means anything, your
mother was so proud of you.

1582
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:54,033
She told me she was blessed
to have a son who worked hard,

1583
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:58,271
who was honest, who looked
for ways to help people.

1584
01:28:06,082 --> 01:28:06,981
What is this?

1585
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:10,483
It's time to do something
about the 50-ton elephant

1586
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:10,483
in the room.

1587
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:15,455
Sutree has suffered
a major breakdown.

1588
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:19,025
This is bellicose,
even for you, Clayton.

1589
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:21,327
I've never heard of this
happening to a faculty member.

1590
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:23,496
We live in bellicose
times, William.

1591
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:29,035
Whenever something is amiss,
you need to take action fast.

1592
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:32,205
Yes, but this sets a
serious procedure in motion.

1593
01:28:32,207 --> 01:28:34,941
A psychiatric ward?

1594
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:36,209
Dr. Doodnaugh agrees.

1595
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:38,544
This is a serious matter.

1596
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:42,515
Azro, don't you think this
is an overly aggressive move?

1597
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:45,251
Based on the video that
Clayton shared with us

1598
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:48,254
and the depositions
of the witnesses,

1599
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:50,356
this is indeed a serious matter.

1600
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:53,259
This man appears to be a
danger to himself and to people

1601
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:54,027
around him.

1602
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,228
Depositions?

1603
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:57,397
Depositions are
already in place?

1604
01:28:57,399 --> 01:28:59,132
There's too much
potential on the table

1605
01:28:59,134 --> 01:29:00,967
to hesitate one second.

1606
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:02,268
Where does this leave Jack?

1607
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:04,604
He'll have some of the
best care available.

1608
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:06,940
The most important
thing is this procedure

1609
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:10,376
protects the university's
interests in the authorship

1610
01:29:10,378 --> 01:29:11,444
of the research.

1611
01:29:25,659 --> 01:29:28,061
Jack?

1612
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:29,262
You're freaking me out.

1613
01:29:29,264 --> 01:29:31,164
You're here in my chapel?

1614
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:32,406
It was my mom's favorite place.

1615
01:29:35,135 --> 01:29:36,602
Oh.

1616
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:37,971
My friend, I'm so sorry.

1617
01:29:40,574 --> 01:29:42,041
Dear, departed one.

1618
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,144
Requiescat in pace.

1619
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:46,679
Please, come this way.

1620
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,314
You shouldn't be
standing here alone.

1621
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:49,215
It's ok.

1622
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,683
I'm good.

1623
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:53,052
Plus, I asked my research
assistant to meet me here.

1624
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:54,354
So I should stay inside.

1625
01:29:54,356 --> 01:29:57,023
Listen, something's happened.

1626
01:29:57,025 --> 01:30:03,196
Maybe a breakthrough in this
thing I'm struggling with.

1627
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:04,664
Ram, good.

1628
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:06,632
Your mechanic said this
replacement part should work.

1629
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:06,632
Thanks.

1630
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,634
Do you know reverend Halloway?

1631
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:09,302
I do now.

1632
01:30:09,304 --> 01:30:10,003
Namaste.

1633
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:11,571
Namaste.

1634
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:12,653
Follow my thinking, Stuart.

1635
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:23,182
Consider your reflection
in the mirror or the sight

1636
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:25,218
of a rainbow in the sky.

1637
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,686
Neither is really there.

1638
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:30,023
But the image is projected
on the back of your retina.

1639
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:32,325
You can take a picture
of them with a camera.

1640
01:30:32,327 --> 01:30:35,361
But the things I'm seeing
cannot be photographed.

1641
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:39,766
They only exist
here, in my head.

1642
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,035
Why in your head?

1643
01:30:50,511 --> 01:30:52,412
Remember the onion
you talked about?

1644
01:30:55,682 --> 01:30:57,683
What defines why we see it?

1645
01:31:01,188 --> 01:31:03,089
Waves.

1646
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:04,357
Light waves.

1647
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:05,625
Waves from all
sorts of directions.

1648
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,361
Where they interfere
defines that onion.

1649
01:31:08,363 --> 01:31:14,500
You show me it's cosmic
and intimate, all at once.

1650
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:18,304
A beautiful, mysterious
thing full of query.

1651
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,807
Light waves are a form
of visible energy.

1652
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:22,809
Somehow, through
the lab accident,

1653
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:27,814
I've become sensitive to other
forms of invisible energy.

1654
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:32,251
You're saying you can see
the very energy of life?

1655
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:34,120
Jack, may I?

1656
01:31:34,122 --> 01:31:36,556
When you saw sunny-girl,
what did you see?

1657
01:31:36,558 --> 01:31:37,857
She was happy.

1658
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,126
Very happy, the
way she always was.

1659
01:31:40,128 --> 01:31:41,394
That's her essence, Jack.

1660
01:31:41,396 --> 01:31:43,262
You were seeing her
essence... the energy

1661
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:46,165
of the essence of what she was.

1662
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,434
Reverend Halloway, Jack has
this very special connection

1663
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:50,169
with one subject we met.

1664
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,604
He had one test
session with her.

1665
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:54,407
A homeless musician, Bazemint.

1666
01:31:54,409 --> 01:31:56,809
When we first met, I had
an unusually strong vision

1667
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,778
with her unlike all the others.

1668
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:02,448
During the session, she
touched my shoulder.

1669
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,584
That's when I saw even
more than her essence,

1670
01:32:04,586 --> 01:32:06,119
if that's what we're calling it.

1671
01:32:06,121 --> 01:32:08,001
I started seeing things
that affect her essence.

1672
01:32:10,557 --> 01:32:14,460
Our senses are the
gateway to our mind.

1673
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:17,797
Perhaps now, the
gateway to the soul.

1674
01:32:17,799 --> 01:32:20,133
Is a final theory
of consciousness

1675
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:27,240
at hand, a way to translate and
study the metadata of the soul?

1676
01:32:27,242 --> 01:32:29,275
The girl you were
studying... when will you

1677
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:30,243
work with her again?

1678
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:32,145
It's not possible now.

1679
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:33,679
Dr. Redfield has
taken over the lab.

1680
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:33,679
With everything that's happened,

1681
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:38,584
it's imperative that you come
up with solid substantiation,

1682
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:41,154
indisputable proof,
of what you have.

1683
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:44,557
Or you're going to be gorged
by a pack of hungry wolves.

1684
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:44,557
How bad is it at the lab?

1685
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:48,261
I can't get in without
Medina or Redfield.

1686
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:49,328
No, I have to get in somehow.

1687
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,264
I need to retrieve the flask.

1688
01:32:51,266 --> 01:32:53,566
But it's missing
from the cabinet.

1689
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,835
Oh, I didn't leave
it in the cabinet.

1690
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:57,803
Dr. sutree, huzzah!

1691
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,405
Go pick up Bazemint.

1692
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:00,873
I'm going to drop the
starter in my car.

1693
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,542
Stuart, can you
get us into a lab?

1694
01:33:02,544 --> 01:33:04,477
Ram can let you know the
specifics on the monitoring

1695
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:05,378
equipment.

1696
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,412
I'll make some calls.

1697
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,680
Let me know when you're ready.

1698
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:09,749
Great.

1699
01:33:15,789 --> 01:33:17,890
Like... like this?

1700
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,959
Yes.

1701
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:25,498
Now we wait.

1702
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,900
Did you want to go through any
of the analysis on the drives?

1703
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:29,969
We have them.

1704
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,505
Were there any handwritten
materials generated?

1705
01:33:32,507 --> 01:33:33,573
Those are filed back here.

1706
01:33:43,886 --> 01:33:44,785
You find her?

1707
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:44,784
Problem, Jack.

1708
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:48,521
I gave Bazemint the
news about her mother.

1709
01:33:48,523 --> 01:33:49,589
What do you mean?

1710
01:33:49,591 --> 01:33:49,589
She's a bit upset.

1711
01:33:49,591 --> 01:33:53,759
I think you need to come here
and speak with her in person.

1712
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:53,759
All right.

1713
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:55,228
Shoot me your location.

1714
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:57,296
On my way.

1715
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:09,408
Bazemint, I'm really sorry
about the news of your mom.

1716
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:11,777
But you agree, it's better that
you know what happened, right?

1717
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:12,678
It's not the news.

1718
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:12,678
It's the respect.

1719
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:16,249
My mama never got no respect,
not even when she died.

1720
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:16,949
I don't understand.

1721
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:16,949
You weren't there.

1722
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:19,552
How would you know
she was disrespected?

1723
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:20,419
Not then.

1724
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:22,021
Now.

1725
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:25,024
That woman's ashes are sitting
on a punk-ass shelf in a closet

1726
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:27,393
in a goddamn closet.

1727
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:29,362
That's no way to leave a person.

1728
01:34:29,364 --> 01:34:30,997
My mama needs to be respected.

1729
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:33,399
She needs to be buried.

1730
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:35,501
Ram, will they allow that?

1731
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:36,936
It's going to be
difficult, Jack.

1732
01:34:36,938 --> 01:34:38,571
None of the canisters are IDEd.

1733
01:34:38,573 --> 01:34:40,006
They're all grouped by date.

1734
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,774
It's a lack of records.

1735
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:43,576
Bazemint, what if I
petition the institute

1736
01:34:43,578 --> 01:34:44,644
to bury all the canisters?

1737
01:34:44,646 --> 01:34:46,312
Would that be ok with you?

1738
01:34:46,314 --> 01:34:47,413
She needs her own space.

1739
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:48,981
She needs her own respect.

1740
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:50,583
She weren't perfect.

1741
01:34:50,585 --> 01:34:51,817
I know that.

1742
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:55,388
But my mama should
have her final respect.

1743
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,456
It's tough, Jack.

1744
01:34:57,458 --> 01:35:01,427
There are hundreds of cans.

1745
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:03,829
No, there's a way.

1746
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:06,666
Bazemint, I promise
you, I will find which

1747
01:35:06,668 --> 01:35:08,467
canister has your mom's ashes.

1748
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:09,769
How can you do that?

1749
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:12,305
I'm asking you to
trust me on this.

1750
01:35:12,307 --> 01:35:14,373
Ok.

1751
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:18,344
How you gonna do that?

1752
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:19,712
Don't forget.

1753
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:20,714
We got al-Gore-rhythms.

1754
01:36:41,027 --> 01:36:42,595
Just me, Clay.

1755
01:36:42,597 --> 01:36:43,496
Bleu?

1756
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:45,064
You're still here?

1757
01:36:45,066 --> 01:36:47,700
Yeah, I was coming to bring
you the signed hospitalization

1758
01:36:47,702 --> 01:36:48,601
form.

1759
01:36:48,603 --> 01:36:48,601
But wouldn't you know?

1760
01:36:48,603 --> 01:36:49,969
It's in the other bag.

1761
01:36:54,975 --> 01:36:57,476
I double-checked the formula
and the methodologies.

1762
01:36:57,478 --> 01:37:01,080
We followed everything exactly.

1763
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:04,884
Well, nothing happened.

1764
01:37:04,886 --> 01:37:10,055
It appears this phenomenon
is specific going to sutree.

1765
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:12,558
I fear he holds some
missing information.

1766
01:37:17,497 --> 01:37:19,865
Yes?

1767
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:22,501
I see.

1768
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:26,872
Ms. Hamid, tell me what
business does Mr. Tambel have

1769
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:29,141
at the Teargarden institute.

1770
01:37:41,621 --> 01:37:44,190
So many visions
to psychoanalyze.

1771
01:37:49,629 --> 01:37:53,899
The politician screaming
the bleedin' lies.

1772
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:02,208
You burn down the highway,
leaving no place to run.

1773
01:38:05,245 --> 01:38:07,947
Hey, shake, babe.

1774
01:38:07,949 --> 01:38:12,885
Shake off your demon
and watch that angel go.

1775
01:38:34,941 --> 01:38:37,009
This is going to take a while.

1776
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:41,981
We'll find her.

1777
01:38:41,983 --> 01:38:42,983
Ready, Jack.

1778
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:50,623
Come out.

1779
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:52,691
All of you, please.

1780
01:38:56,029 --> 01:38:57,696
What's up with Mr. clean?

1781
01:38:57,698 --> 01:38:59,298
This is Dr. Redfield, Bazemint.

1782
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:02,101
Do you both realize that
you are assisting a man who

1783
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,702
is in serious trouble?

1784
01:39:03,704 --> 01:39:04,837
Careful, Redfield.

1785
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:07,273
I assault board of
regents members.

1786
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:08,909
Redfield!

1787
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:10,776
Why did he lock the door?

1788
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,278
There's no way out!

1789
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,245
Redfield, please.

1790
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:14,880
You need supervision.

1791
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:16,115
Get the guard to open this door.

1792
01:39:16,117 --> 01:39:17,117
Clayton!

1793
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:20,219
Redfield, please,
you need supervision.

1794
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:23,756
Redfield!

1795
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:41,907
We need to do further testing.

1796
01:39:41,909 --> 01:39:42,909
Clayton, please.

1797
01:39:45,946 --> 01:39:47,880
Clayton, listen to me.

1798
01:39:47,882 --> 01:39:49,615
Do not use the goggles.

1799
01:39:49,617 --> 01:39:50,617
There are side effects.

1800
01:39:53,653 --> 01:39:54,653
Think, Clayton.

1801
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:57,656
Clayton!

1802
01:39:57,658 --> 01:39:59,825
Do not use the goggles.

1803
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,226
We need to do more testing.

1804
01:40:01,228 --> 01:40:03,629
There are side effects.

1805
01:40:03,631 --> 01:40:04,964
Clayton, please.

1806
01:40:04,966 --> 01:40:07,166
You gotta listen to me.

1807
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:09,669
Redfield...

1808
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:12,638
Oh.

1809
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:13,138
Oh.

1810
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,139
Back.

1811
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:15,141
Back.

1812
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:18,111
Stay back.

1813
01:41:20,373 --> 01:41:21,373
Ma... mama?

1814
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,747
Oh, you're my mama.

1815
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:29,882
I know it.

1816
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,426
Clayton!

1817
01:41:44,864 --> 01:41:47,099
Get one of the doctors, now.

1818
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:49,101
Get his buttons.

1819
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,335
Stay with us, Clayton.

1820
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:59,244
Are you... are you ok?

1821
01:41:59,246 --> 01:42:03,148
What can I do for you?

1822
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,784
Oh, my child.

1823
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:06,385
Would you look at that?

1824
01:42:06,387 --> 01:42:08,387
It is.

1825
01:42:08,389 --> 01:42:11,056
Are you real?

1826
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:12,891
You better believe I'm real.

1827
01:42:15,962 --> 01:42:18,030
Bee never moves without
being led by someone.

1828
01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:22,301
Oh, mama.

1829
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:23,769
Oh, my child.

1830
01:42:27,273 --> 01:42:29,742
Oh, my little child.

1831
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:41,353
What is that woman's name?

1832
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:43,055
She's patient 108.

1833
01:42:43,057 --> 01:42:45,224
But everyone here calls her bee.

1834
01:42:45,226 --> 01:42:45,224
Bee minor.

1835
01:42:45,226 --> 01:42:48,260
She's only ever played
one song on that piano.

1836
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:49,995
Professor Jack.

1837
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:51,296
That's my mama, that's my mama.

1838
01:42:51,298 --> 01:42:52,798
I knows it.

1839
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:53,899
Are you sure?

1840
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:55,501
I knows it in my bones.

1841
01:42:55,503 --> 01:42:56,335
That's how sure I am.

1842
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:57,836
Ok.

1843
01:42:57,838 --> 01:43:01,907
This patient's records
were lost years ago.

1844
01:43:01,909 --> 01:43:05,511
Anything that you have that
can help us with her identity

1845
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:06,812
will be helpful.

1846
01:43:06,814 --> 01:43:08,147
I'm from cu.

1847
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:10,349
Bazemint is working with
us on an important study.

1848
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:12,017
We can help confirm
this woman's identity.

1849
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:13,318
Just let us know what you need.

1850
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:16,121
Coming through.

1851
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:17,422
What happened to him?

1852
01:43:17,424 --> 01:43:18,891
Too many drugs.

1853
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:51,824
Stand here, please.

1854
01:43:57,832 --> 01:43:58,463
Ok, thank you.

1855
01:43:58,465 --> 01:43:59,198
Stand there.

1856
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,599
Good.

1857
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:03,836
The test program seems
to have caught on.

1858
01:44:03,838 --> 01:44:07,506
We can handle maybe
30 more candidates.

1859
01:44:07,508 --> 01:44:10,275
Has Jack had any progress
on expanding the formula?

1860
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:10,275
Not yet.

1861
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:13,045
We haven't found a
substitute for what

1862
01:44:13,047 --> 01:44:15,414
he calls the sunny-girl factor.

1863
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:16,416
Stay with it.

1864
01:44:20,854 --> 01:44:21,854
May I?

1865
01:44:53,519 --> 01:44:56,121
Bazemint says you a mover.

1866
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,991
Talking about freeafying
the mind and shit.

1867
01:44:58,993 --> 01:45:01,927
You're always
looking for something.

1868
01:45:01,929 --> 01:45:04,463
Everyone is.

1869
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:08,433
But there's one thing you
really want... the truth.

1870
01:45:11,337 --> 01:45:13,906
Man, who don't want the truth?

1871
01:45:13,908 --> 01:45:15,474
It sure would make
things a lot easier

1872
01:45:15,476 --> 01:45:17,476
rather than all the bullshit.

1873
01:45:17,478 --> 01:45:22,147
The thing is you
already know the truth.

1874
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,449
You just never had the
opportunity to express it.

1875
01:45:24,451 --> 01:45:27,419
Damn straight.

1876
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:30,956
It's time you try
another way to speak.

1877
01:45:30,958 --> 01:45:32,558
Who's going to listen
to someone like me?

1878
01:45:36,029 --> 01:45:37,869
Give this to the person
at the table out there.

1879
01:45:47,106 --> 01:45:48,573
Hey.

1880
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:50,475
You, me.

1881
01:45:50,477 --> 01:45:53,278
We get our grounding from
wherever we can find it.

1882
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,280
Good luck.

1883
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:03,655
This is the address of
the Williams art center.

1884
01:46:03,657 --> 01:46:06,325
Tomorrow, they will be
expecting you at 10:00 am.

1885
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:10,696
Why?

1886
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:13,031
You'll begin your new class.

1887
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,599
Just show up.

1888
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:19,204
Everything else... supplies,
lunch... has been taken care of.

1889
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:21,740
What class?

1890
01:46:21,742 --> 01:46:22,742
Canvas painting.

1891
01:46:36,622 --> 01:46:38,357
The connection you
have with each person.

1892
01:46:41,494 --> 01:46:43,228
Pretty intense.

1893
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:47,466
I saw a vet earlier today.

1894
01:46:47,468 --> 01:46:50,435
He was a hostage in Iraq.

1895
01:46:50,437 --> 01:46:53,305
He asked his captor
when he would be free.

1896
01:46:53,307 --> 01:46:55,073
The captor, the
person in control,

1897
01:46:55,075 --> 01:47:01,513
said, when you are
free, I will be free.

1898
01:47:01,515 --> 01:47:04,116
The captor and the captive.

1899
01:47:04,118 --> 01:47:05,617
The rich and the poor.

1900
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:08,720
The educated and the ignorant.

1901
01:47:08,722 --> 01:47:10,555
Every minute, day,
and night, we're

1902
01:47:10,557 --> 01:47:13,392
putting something out there.

1903
01:47:13,394 --> 01:47:14,760
Naked truth.

1904
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:16,395
Hatred.

1905
01:47:16,397 --> 01:47:17,629
Intense passion.

1906
01:47:17,631 --> 01:47:18,630
Jealousy.

1907
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:19,331
Smarts.

1908
01:47:19,333 --> 01:47:20,732
Dominance.

1909
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:23,035
Submissiveness.

1910
01:47:23,037 --> 01:47:25,670
Indifference.

1911
01:47:25,672 --> 01:47:27,706
Love.

1912
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:30,809
It's all that undying
energy Einstein described

1913
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:35,347
moving, clashing, merging.

1914
01:47:35,349 --> 01:47:41,353
That's why we can
never escape the effect

1915
01:47:41,355 --> 01:47:42,454
we have on each other.

1916
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:51,096
Give it a fly beat that
will dance down the street.

1917
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:54,399
Uh-huh.

1918
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:55,401
There you go.

1919
01:47:59,673 --> 01:48:01,206
There you go.

1920
01:48:04,577 --> 01:48:05,577
It's starting, Jack.

1921
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,750
Let's go.

1922
01:48:25,431 --> 01:48:29,701
She wakes up early
every morning just to do her

1923
01:48:29,703 --> 01:48:33,405
hair now, because
she cares, y'all.

1924
01:48:33,407 --> 01:48:38,710
Her hair wouldn't be
right without her makeup.

1925
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:41,413
She's never out of makeup.

1926
01:48:41,415 --> 01:48:44,182
She's just like you and me.

1927
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,685
But she's homeless.

1928
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:49,688
She's homeless.

1929
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:52,657
And she stands there
singing for money.

1930
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:54,659
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1931
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:56,661
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1932
01:48:56,663 --> 01:48:58,663
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1933
01:48:58,665 --> 01:49:01,833
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1934
01:49:01,835 --> 01:49:05,604
In my sleep, I see her
begging, reaching, please.

1935
01:49:09,842 --> 01:49:14,613
Although the problem's
not mine, I ask god, why?

1936
01:49:14,615 --> 01:49:17,315
God, oh, why?

1937
01:49:17,317 --> 01:49:20,318
She's just like you and me.

1938
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,621
But she's homeless.

1939
01:49:22,623 --> 01:49:25,590
She's homeless.

1940
01:49:25,592 --> 01:49:29,294
And she stands there
singing for money.

1941
01:49:29,296 --> 01:49:30,595
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1942
01:49:30,597 --> 01:49:32,597
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1943
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:34,599
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1944
01:49:34,601 --> 01:49:36,568
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1945
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,570
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1946
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:40,272
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1947
01:49:40,274 --> 01:49:42,274
La-da-Dee, la-Dee-da.

1948
01:49:42,276 --> 01:49:44,276
