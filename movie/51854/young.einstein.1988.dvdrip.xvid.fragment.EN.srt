1
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:13,308
<i>Tasmania, it was just about</i>
<i>the best place to grow up.</i>

2
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:16,517
<i>Thousands of miles of wilderness.</i>

3
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:20,554
<i>And right in the middle of it all</i>
<i>was our apple farm.</i>

4
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:37,439
<i>As exciting as life was on our apple farm...</i>

5
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,901
<i>I still had plenty of time to listen to music.</i>

6
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:44,804
<i>And to think about the universe.</i>

7
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,619
<i>Mom loved cooking.</i>

8
00:02:57,193 --> 00:03:01,254
<i>She'd spend most of her time</i>
<i>baking huge apple pies.</i>

9
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,994
<i>Dad was a man of the land.</i>

10
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:12,233
<i>His interest was in the balance</i>
<i>and harmony of nature.</i>

11
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:18,340
Gotcha.

12
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:23,114
<i>Yep, us Einsteins</i>
<i>had always been apple farmers.</i>

13
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,147
<i>And that's what my dad</i>
<i>had planned for me.</i>

14
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:28,918
<i>But I just couldn't get the hang of it.</i>

15
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:31,754
<i>So that's why I was</i>
<i>in the orchard that day.</i>

16
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:33,455
<i>I was practicing.</i>

17
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:45,900
Look at this, will you? Tasmanian devils.

18
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,577
Eat anything, they will.

19
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:52,011
There's one of the mongrels now.

20
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,241
Good day, mate.

21
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:01,320
He's eating the bloody orchard.

22
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,492
Albert. You okay, son?

23
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,727
For every action
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

24
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,164
I've just formulated
a complete scientific principle.

25
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:32,250
<i>Well, I had my first</i>
<i>complete scientific theory.</i>

26
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,314
<i>All I had to do was prove it.</i>

27
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,913
Timber!

28
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,144
So you see,
I proved that gravitation is a force...

29
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,702
whereby any two bodies
attract each other...

30
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,477
in proportion
to the product of their masses...

31
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,509
and inversely as the square of the distance
between them, Mom.

32
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:14,749
You mean what goes up must come down?

33
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,483
Yeah.

34
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:38,637
Sorry about the roof, Dad.

35
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:43,074
Don't worry about it, son.
I've got a job for you.

36
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:48,453
Now, do you know what I'd like you to do
with this valley, Albert?

37
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,122
What, Dad?

38
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,755
Dam it!

39
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:59,857
But if I dammed it,
I'd drown all the wildlife.

40
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,665
Yep, in one go.

41
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,972
Dad, I'm a pacifist.

42
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:11,469
I believe that all living things...

43
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,648
should be able
to exist together in harmony.

44
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:38,698
So you see, Dad, I want to be a physicist.

45
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:41,642
What do they grow, son?

46
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:46,514
-Physicists don't grow anything.
-What's the use of them, then?

47
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,712
They study the basic laws
and the principles of the universe.

48
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:53,914
You can study the basic laws
and principles of the universe...

49
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,153
in the evening,
after you've done the washing up.

50
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,794
I'm working on a new kind of music, Mom.

51
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,195
That's nice, dear.

52
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:44,703
Sometimes I wonder whether
he's cut out for farming.

53
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,703
He just doesn't seem to fit in here.

54
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:14,127
Time for bed, Albert, love.

55
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,708
-Good night, Dad.
-Good night, Albert.

56
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:27,546
-Good night, Albert.
-Good night, Mom.

57
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:32,385
Sweet dreams, Mommy's little possum.

58
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:44,757
Albert! So you're a scientist, are you, son?

59
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,031
-Yes, Dad.
-I've got a job for you in the morning.

60
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:26,072
-Where are we going, Dad?
-Granddad's shed.

61
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,676
It was your granddad's wish...

62
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,304
that an Einstein would carry on
the work that he began.

63
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:36,948
-What work, Dad?
-You'll find out soon enough, son.

64
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:05,947
<i>Wow! Granddad built</i>
<i>a scientific laboratory in here.</i>

65
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,811
Shut the door, son.

66
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,880
This is it, Bert.

67
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,986
The thing that will put us Einsteins
into the history books.

68
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,452
Beer.

69
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:20,754
Beer.

70
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,027
What is beer, Dad?

71
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,866
The secret of brewing beer
is an Einstein tradition.

72
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,963
My father taught it to me.

73
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:35,568
He taught it to his father,
and his father to his father's father.

74
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,905
Sit down, Bert.

75
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:45,949
The problem is,
as is with the problem with all beer...

76
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:48,480
is that it lacks bubbles.

77
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:52,053
Well, why don't you put bubbles in it?

78
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,355
Try as it may...

79
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:59,561
mankind has never succeeded
in putting bubbles in beer.

80
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:04,599
The person who succeeds
will change the world forever.

81
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,087
-Father?
-Not now, Mother. I've got a headache.

82
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:40,528
<i>Well, there is one thing</i>
<i>that would force bubbles into beer.</i>

83
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:44,505
I mean, I suppose
you can split a beer atom.

84
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,003
<i>Atomic energy.</i>

85
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,542
If you could split the nucleus
of a beer atom into two fragments...

86
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,642
then the mass of the two fragments...

87
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,712
will be less than the mass
of the original nucleus...

88
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:04,553
and the difference in mass
will be transformed into energy.

89
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:08,423
Energy equals mass...

90
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:11,196
times the square of the speed of light!

91
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:15,159
I'll give it a go.

92
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:20,968
Right.

93
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,038
Bubbles into beer.

94
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,411
First, isolate the molecular structure...

95
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:30,576
of this alcohol.

96
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,491
Readjust the orbit...

97
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:41,292
of these electrons.

98
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:49,260
Then all I have to do
is split this beer atom.

99
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,735
Where's that chisel?

100
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:19,659
Albert. Is that you?

101
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,368
Look, Dad!

102
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,303
Bubbles!

103
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:31,208
And it's got a good head, too.

104
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:39,684
Not bad.
This'll put the Einsteins on the map.

105
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,692
-What's happening, Father?
-The boy's finally done it, Mother.

106
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:50,327
Albert, you're a genius.
How'd you come up with it?

107
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,197
I discovered the formula
for splitting beer atoms.

108
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:58,766
"Emc."

109
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,510
We've got to register this
at the patent office.

110
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,479
Albert, you've got to go to the mainland.

111
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,980
Goodbye, Bert.

112
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:21,119
-Good luck, son.
-Goodbye, Dad.

113
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:23,764
Goodbye, Mom.

114
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,825
Goodbye.

115
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,064
My son.

116
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,307
Pardon, <i>monsieur?</i>

117
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,108
-What would you like to do?
-You speak English. Splendid.

118
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:06,848
Preston Preston...

119
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,421
of the Perth Prestons.

120
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,395
<i>Young Newton.</i>

121
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,738
Isn't this unbelievable?

122
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,538
I, myself, am in the scientific field.

123
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,941
Dozens of scientists come
into my office every day.

124
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:35,745
Of course, I have to turn
most of them down.

125
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,718
Yes. Science has always
held a fascination for me.

126
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:41,483
For example, do you know
how a gramophone works?

127
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:42,955
It's really very simple.

128
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:45,858
The little needle
picks up these vibrations....

129
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:50,462
What the devil is the engine driver up to?

130
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:54,293
Stopping the train
in the middle of a desert. <i>Sacré bleu.</i>

131
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,832
Anyway, where was I?

132
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,702
-Very small....
-Yes.

133
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:03,370
Now, these tiny little vibrations...

134
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:07,279
are caused by dozens of grooves
which are cut into the disc...

135
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,843
and they go all the way up the arm
to a great big horn which amplifies it.

136
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,681
You know, makes it louder! Like this.

137
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,184
And <i>voilà.</i> A song. See?

138
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,862
Good day.

139
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,010
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

140
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,978
It's just a little snake.

141
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,413
It's a lizard.

142
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,417
Yes.

143
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,052
Now, sound.

144
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,398
How can I describe it to you?

145
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,163
Sound is like big waves at the beach,
you see...

146
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,727
because sound travels in waves
just like light.

147
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:07,741
-I'm not going too fast for you, am I?
-No. Light travels as particles.

148
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:10,175
Light travels as particles and waves.

149
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:16,343
How can light travel simultaneously
in two different ways?

150
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,586
Space tells matter how to move...

151
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,691
and matter tells space how to curve.

152
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,551
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> you must be
a student of the sciences.

153
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:31,159
Yes. I am to study
at the Sydney University.

154
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,497
Fascinating. You got a scholarship?

155
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:35,567
Not exactly. I won a prize.

156
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:37,662
The old high school science prize?

157
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:41,140
It was a Nobel Prize,
1903, Applied Physics.

158
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,904
-Really?
-You see...

159
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:46,744
I think that
if we could control the ionizing radiation...

160
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:51,013
of the spontaneous disintegration
of uranium isotopes...

161
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,515
we could harness the forces of nature.

162
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,181
Splitting atoms.

163
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,724
You've heard of the theory
to split the nucleus of an atom?

164
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,319
I've split one once.

165
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:03,626
You've already split the atom?

166
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,034
It was only a Tasmanian beer atom.

167
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,529
What?

168
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:14,169
That one atom was enough
to blow the old man's shed apart.

169
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:15,504
Really.

170
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:18,407
Atomic power.

171
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,743
You must tell me more
about your research...

172
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,309
but first, let me introduce myself.

173
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,853
My name is Marie. Marie Curie.

174
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:32,723
Albert. Albert Einstein.

175
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:36,822
Do you realize this is a first-class carriage?

176
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:40,133
Conductor, there's a bushman
in my carriage.

177
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,269
-So?
-You see, I worked out that...

178
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,969
energy equals mass times
the square of the speed of light.

179
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:07,285
No.

180
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,991
Excuse me.

181
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:50,061
"Emc?"

182
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:53,869
Energy equals mass times
the square of the speed of light.

183
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:57,139
A patent application
must be accompanied...

184
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:59,680
by a provisional specification.

185
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,978
-What's that?
-An invention.

186
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,745
You have to have an invention
to patent an invention.

187
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:10,424
But it's all in my head.

188
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:14,527
Well, what do you wish us to do, sir,
patent your head?

189
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,833
We take patents, not formulas.

190
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,913
Good day.

191
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:47,320
Where did you blow in from, curly?

192
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,051
Tasmania.

193
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:53,587
What's that in your pocket, big boy?

194
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:00,227
It's a compass.

195
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,671
Excuse me.

196
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:12,046
Excuse me. Have you got a room?

197
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:17,675
-This is a hotel, isn't it?
-Yes.

198
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,286
You want the big bed, ace?

199
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:25,957
Go on.

200
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,824
No.

201
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:33,323
So, you're looking for a room?

202
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:38,969
You want a room with a window?

203
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:41,809
Yes, please.

204
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:02,187
Right. Here it is, the penthouse.

205
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,495
With <i>en suite</i> bathroom.

206
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:29,145
Bravo!

207
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:41,059
That was excitement.
Are you having a good time?

208
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,902
Yes, thank you.

209
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:45,267
<i>The Marriage of Figaro.</i>

210
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,640
That last piece was, of course, where
Madame Butterfly emerges from the duck.

211
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,201
It was moving.

212
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,573
Preston, do you remember
that strange man from the train?

213
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,143
-Albert Einstein.
-The bushman?

214
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:02,485
Yes. What about him?

215
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,388
I've been thinking about his theory.

216
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,258
That. Marie, don't waste your time.

217
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,354
Indecipherable nonsense.

218
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,158
Poor beggar probably thought...

219
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:16,670
he could bring it to Sydney
and sell it for a fortune.

220
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:19,305
I think it is most remarkable.

221
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:23,035
Imagine. Splitting atoms.

222
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,403
And such primitive equipment.

223
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,938
Yes, a good trick, I suppose.
But really, Marie...

224
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,985
one scientist to another...

225
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:34,312
bubble research.

226
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:37,483
It's not that stimulating, now, is it?

227
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:39,789
On the contrary, Preston.

228
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:43,159
I think his formula
has enormous potential.

229
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,130
Really?

230
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:57,542
Good.

231
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,814
It's worthless, of course,
but why don't you leave it with us?

232
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:17,526
-To our new and lucrative partnership.
-Yes.

233
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:23,069
-Emc?
-You think it will work?

234
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:26,106
Believe me, <i>Herr</i> Wolfgang,
you're not going to regret this.

235
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:29,234
This formula will revolutionize brewing
as we know it.

236
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:32,541
-You and I are going to be very, very rich.
-Rich!

237
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,429
1, 2, 3, 4...

238
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:54,263
5, 6, 7, 8.

239
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:57,828
<i>A musical beat.</i>

240
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,540
<i>1, 2, 3, 4.</i>

241
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:03,771
<i>The beat, 2, 3, 4.</i>

242
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:07,440
<i>Downbeats are on one and three.</i>
<i>The backbeats are on two and four.</i>

243
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:10,784
<i>So the upbeat acceleration is equal...</i>

244
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:13,844
<i>to the escape velocity of the downbeat.</i>

245
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,320
<i>Upbeat equals downbeat.</i>

246
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,201
<i>In that state,</i>
<i>gravity will roll to the downbeat.</i>

247
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,198
<i>Therefore, the body motion</i>
<i>must rock to the upbeat.</i>

248
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:36,940
<i>I've just invented a new musical theory.</i>

249
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,575
<i>Roll and rock.</i>

250
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:53,920
What are you doing, Albert?

251
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:58,486
A scientific musical theory
based on the human heartbeat.

252
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,288
You're so clever.

253
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,699
No, actually, anyone could play it.

254
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,334
It's simple.

255
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,763
Four bars, four beats to the bar...

256
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,999
with a backbeat.

257
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:24,383
I think I'll go to bed.

258
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,215
Night.

259
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:49,302
<i>Music is the motion of sounds.</i>

260
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:52,710
<i>And motion is measured by speed.</i>

261
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:57,245
<i>Therefore, I could increase</i>
<i>the intensity of the music...</i>

262
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,720
<i>by amplifying the volume of the beat...</i>

263
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:02,887
<i>by the speed of light.</i>

264
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:05,949
<i>That's 186,000 miles per second.</i>

265
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,492
<i>That's fast, very fast.</i>

266
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:11,195
<i>At upwards of 119 decibels...</i>

267
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,358
<i>that's very loud.</i>

268
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:15,800
<i>Well, the only way</i>
<i>to get a result like that...</i>

269
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,464
<i>will be to electrify a musical instrument.</i>

270
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,914
What's this?

271
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,380
It electrifies music.

272
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:07,486
It electrifies music, does it?

273
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:10,321
Just what we need.

274
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:11,756
You do?

275
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,501
And stay out!

276
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:31,775
-Here, Albert.
-What happened?

277
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:39,779
It's here.

278
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:43,449
Do you know the way to the university?
Thank you.

279
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:45,014
It's come.

280
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,534
Sheep farming.

281
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,396
-Scholarship?
-Yep.

282
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:00,132
Get in there. Go on.

283
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,912
-I'm looking for Marie Curie.
-The beautiful French scientist?

284
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,649
Science, £1.

285
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:14,477
That's a bit steep.

286
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:16,716
Excuse me.

287
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,877
And stay out!

288
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:51,249
You fail.

289
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:57,755
You embarrassed me in there.

290
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:00,760
Sorry. It's just that your teacher
was so wrong.

291
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,966
He was very angry.
I don't think he understood at all.

292
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,232
Your mind is astonishing.

293
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,416
-Look at Albert.
-Is that Albert?

294
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:33,187
-He looks so different.
-Look at his hair.

295
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,286
-I don't think I should ask him now.
-I think you should.

296
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:37,956
You ask him.

297
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,829
Go on!

298
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,907
How come Newton's theory
doesn't account for Galileo's law?

299
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:48,066
Yeah.

300
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:50,838
With a multitude
of different simultaneities...

301
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,242
within the universe...

302
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:55,578
how can any gravitational effect
be suddenly everywhere...

303
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:58,049
at a common, simultaneous instant?

304
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:03,354
Told you.

305
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,765
You know, Marie, when you compare...

306
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,774
all of science in the world against nature...

307
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:30,600
science is just primitive and child-like...

308
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,479
but it's the most precious thing we have.

309
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:37,073
Albert, if only this moment
would last forever.

310
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,779
If only time could stand still.

311
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:44,888
That's it!

312
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,589
That's the theory of relativity.

313
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:49,022
What?

314
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,658
Light travels to us
from the hands of that clock...

315
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:54,496
to tell us the time.

316
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:59,171
If we could travel away from that clock
at the speed of light....

317
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,976
Then the hands of the clock
would appear to have stopped.

318
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,535
Time would stand still.
This moment would last forever.

319
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:15,253
-Did you just think of that?
-Yes.

320
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:22,284
Where do you live?

321
00:41:57,498 --> 00:42:00,126
-Are you okay, mister?
-Yep.

322
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,765
<i>I am writing to recommend</i>
<i>a most brilliant scientific thinker...</i>

323
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,168
<i>Albert Einstein.</i>

324
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:12,437
<i>I would be personally</i>
<i>indebted to you,</i> Monsieur <i>Preston...</i>

325
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,311
<i>if you would consider him</i>
<i>for a position in your office.</i>

326
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:19,880
<i>I know his assistance</i>
<i>would be invaluable to you...</i>

327
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,446
<i>in the most complex areas</i>
<i>of scientific research.</i>

328
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,453
It's simple, double entry
bookkeeping, Einstein!

329
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,958
In the right column,
you write what's left out.

330
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:33,557
Left out?

331
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,102
In the left column, you write what's left in.

332
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,296
Left in.

333
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:39,965
So all that's left in is left, right?

334
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,634
Left right?

335
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:44,735
And all that's left out,
you write in the right columns, right?

336
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,144
So nothing's left out, right?

337
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:48,704
Left outright?

338
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:54,853
<i>Dear Mom and Dad...</i>

339
00:42:56,056 --> 00:42:58,547
<i>I hope you are both well.</i>

340
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:05,832
<i>I have a good job at the patent office...</i>

341
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:12,404
<i>and I've found a nice place to live.</i>

342
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:18,502
"I have met a wonderful girl.

343
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:20,342
"I will write again soon.

344
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:22,473
"Your loving son, Albert.

345
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,177
"PS: I think I have almost discovered...

346
00:43:26,553 --> 00:43:28,544
"the key to the universe."

347
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:31,148
He's met a girl!

348
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,257
A girl?

349
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:42,301
It's not that Einstein is stupid.

350
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,064
<i>-Madame?</i>
-No, thank you.

351
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,374
Have you seen those boots that he wears?

352
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:54,608
He's raw, rough. Coarse, if you like.

353
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:56,614
Coarse?

354
00:43:56,684 --> 00:43:59,278
He's a loner. He's not one of the team.

355
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,988
-And that is a bad thing?
-Terrible.

356
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,890
It has a terrible effect on office morale.

357
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:12,223
It's not that he doesn't have
a modicum of potential.

358
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:13,926
It's just that....

359
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:17,232
I don't know where he would be...

360
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:20,398
without the patience
of people like you and I.

361
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:23,409
It was very nice of you to do this for me...

362
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:28,315
and thank you for a very pleasant time.

363
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:34,145
I've been thinking of expanding
onto the world stage...

364
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:36,712
and I want you to be there with me.

365
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:41,127
I love you, Marie, with all my heart.

366
00:44:42,162 --> 00:44:45,393
And if this wasn't such an exclusive club...

367
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:46,933
I'd kiss you.

368
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:51,798
Preston, you're so sweet, but l--

369
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:54,670
Think about what I've said, darling.
Go now.

370
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:57,176
-But, Preston--
-Not another word.

371
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,776
I know how you must be feeling.

372
00:45:10,758 --> 00:45:11,918
Right.

373
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,324
Every day, without fail,
you've been late for work.

374
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:11,337
You see, there are two 8:00's.

375
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:13,963
One in the morning and one at night.

376
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:18,907
Therefore time is relative to the observer.

377
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:20,839
-Time is--
-Money.

378
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,138
Time is money.

379
00:48:24,585 --> 00:48:26,780
Mr. Einstein, you're not fooling anyone.

380
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:28,912
Out of consideration
for <i>Mademoiselle</i> Curie...

381
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,287
I have tolerated behavior
which would've landed...

382
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,589
most junior assistant clerks
on the street in a matter of minutes.

383
00:48:35,963 --> 00:48:37,726
I like you, Albert.

384
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:42,361
I wish you'd think of me as a friend.

385
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,533
Not many men would be
forthright enough to tell you this...

386
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,874
but you have no ability,
no talent, and no potential.

387
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:55,044
I'm going to do you a favor, Albert.
I'm going to let you go.

388
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:50,970
Mr. Einstein!

389
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:55,840
Preston Preston's building a machine
to split beer atoms.

390
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:00,469
He's using your formula.

391
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:02,272
Look. Here.

392
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:06,050
No.

393
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,558
Open up!

394
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:39,250
Hold everything!

395
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:40,946
-What's going on?
-Excuse me.

396
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:43,114
You're disrupting the beer production.

397
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:46,717
It's too dangerous.
You can't build that machine.

398
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:48,689
Can't I?

399
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,731
-You're crazy.
-Got you.

400
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:57,100
-Fruitcake.
-Where are we going?

401
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:16,621
Rutherford.

402
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:19,119
Ernest Rutherford!

403
00:51:25,465 --> 00:51:26,864
Rutherford.

404
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:29,796
Asprin's the name.

405
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:32,271
Brian Asprin.

406
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:34,600
Brian.

407
00:51:34,808 --> 00:51:36,605
What are you in for?

408
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,838
Oh, space and time curved?

409
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,539
Personally, I got busted for drugs.

410
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:47,447
Science? I'm keenly interested.

411
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,015
Pleased to meet you, Keenly.

412
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,934
What are you up to, Einstein?

413
00:53:16,009 --> 00:53:18,000
-Physics, Keenly.
-May I?

414
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:23,177
A relativity theory.

415
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:25,841
That's clever.

416
00:53:38,031 --> 00:53:40,090
But, you know, Einstein...

417
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:42,999
a theory like this would only be viable...

418
00:53:43,069 --> 00:53:45,629
if the speed of light were constant.

419
00:53:46,406 --> 00:53:47,805
I'm sorry.

420
00:53:48,842 --> 00:53:50,810
-It is.
-Constant?

421
00:53:50,877 --> 00:53:52,003
Is that a fact?

422
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:55,878
It's not only constant,
but nothing can travel faster than it.

423
00:53:55,949 --> 00:53:58,577
Nothing can travel faster than light?

424
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:01,979
What if I'm on a train
that's traveling at the speed of light...

425
00:54:02,055 --> 00:54:06,048
and I move forward from
the back carriage to the front carriage?

426
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:09,090
Then I'd be traveling faster than light.

427
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,324
No, you wouldn't.

428
00:54:14,234 --> 00:54:16,896
But that's an affront to common sense.

429
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,931
-That's relativity.
-Relativity.

430
00:54:21,908 --> 00:54:25,867
In my book, Newton says
that the laws of the universe are fixed.

431
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:27,871
Newton's wrong.

432
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,482
-What have you done with him?
-Who?

433
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:34,349
Albert Einstein.
You stole his formula, didn't you?

434
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:36,685
-I did not.
-How could you do such a thing?

435
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:39,384
He had nothing.
No money, no equipment...

436
00:54:39,459 --> 00:54:41,359
he didn't even have an education.

437
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:44,329
He had to come up
with the entire theory in his head.

438
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:46,228
And you, you just take it.

439
00:54:46,299 --> 00:54:49,700
Marie, I did not just take it.
I merely borrowed it...

440
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:53,364
in order to develop
a lucrative proposition for us all.

441
00:54:53,773 --> 00:54:56,606
Einstein will get a percentage, of course.

442
00:54:56,676 --> 00:54:59,110
I hate you for what you have done.

443
00:54:59,479 --> 00:55:02,004
I don't see
what you're getting so upset about.

444
00:55:02,082 --> 00:55:04,812
Somebody had to make something of it.
He never would.

445
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,978
He wouldn't, would he?
We'll see about that.

446
00:55:14,861 --> 00:55:17,921
Hello. I'm looking for Albert Einstein.

447
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:21,559
-He's not here.
-But I know he's here.

448
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:24,102
-He's taking a bath.
-I'll wait.

449
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,900
Mr. Einstein is a notoriously long bather.

450
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:29,567
In my opinion,
it would be pointless for you to wait.

451
00:55:29,642 --> 00:55:31,633
I will wait forever.

452
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:34,043
-Are you a relative?
-No.

453
00:55:34,114 --> 00:55:37,140
We'll let in only relatives
and the immediate family.

454
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:54,429
Every time
I think of your relativity theory...

455
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,396
I get a headache.

456
00:55:57,837 --> 00:55:59,134
Sorry, Brian.

457
00:55:59,205 --> 00:56:02,106
-I dropped the soap.
-Careful.

458
00:56:14,554 --> 00:56:16,886
You're his father?

459
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:19,992
-Yes.
-All right.

460
00:56:24,197 --> 00:56:26,791
The inmates are all in the shower
this time of day.

461
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:30,832
As much as I would like to go in there...

462
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:32,838
this is as far as I go.

463
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,806
Tiger!

464
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,180
Bugger off!

465
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:46,917
Excuse me.

466
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,154
I am looking for Albert Einstein.

467
00:56:51,424 --> 00:56:53,051
I am his father.

468
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,359
That's him over there.

469
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,225
Everybody! Einstein's father's here!

470
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:02,996
Einstein's father?

471
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:36,034
Close family.

472
00:57:50,183 --> 00:57:52,913
I've been searching for you everywhere.

473
00:57:55,288 --> 00:57:57,654
Preston stole your beer formula.

474
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,919
I know. I'm a bit worried about that.

475
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,256
E=mc2?

476
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,164
Yep, that's the one.

477
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,395
That's not just a beer formula.
That's dangerous.

478
00:58:09,469 --> 00:58:11,096
What's he done, Professor?

479
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:13,366
He's hit upon
the elusive formula for energy.

480
00:58:13,439 --> 00:58:15,066
What, the formula for energy?

481
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:18,235
-He better make sure nobody applies it.
-Albert!

482
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:23,772
They're saying he intends to build
the largest beer keg in the world!

483
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,587
He's a woman!

484
00:59:06,392 --> 00:59:08,724
Albert, you have to take action.

485
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,356
It is your duty to make people understand
what is happening.

486
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:15,265
Marie, I don't understand
what's happening.

487
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,932
I'll tell you what's happening.

488
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:21,770
Your formula's a blueprint
for the destruction of the world.

489
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:27,237
Some pacifist Einstein turned out to be.

490
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,304
Smarty-pants.

491
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:31,642
You've done it now, Einstein.

492
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,946
I'm sick of this.

493
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,787
I'm sick of brains!
All this thinking all the time.

494
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:40,855
Think, think, think.

495
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,651
I want a man who will do something.

496
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,994
-Marie, l--
-And if you won't...

497
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:48,957
then who will?

498
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,033
Look out.

499
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,275
Marie! It's me, Albert!

500
01:03:24,016 --> 01:03:25,313
I'm free!

501
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:41,832
-Hello, Albert.
-Albert!

502
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:44,165
Where have you been?

503
01:03:44,804 --> 01:03:46,294
Mental asylum.

504
01:03:46,606 --> 01:03:49,575
We can't work out
how space can be curved.

505
01:03:49,642 --> 01:03:51,405
Sounds really silly.

506
01:03:51,477 --> 01:03:54,412
I can't work out
where Marie could have gone.

507
01:03:55,381 --> 01:03:58,475
I suppose that could be
in the letter she left.

508
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:01,477
Yes.

509
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:06,990
"Albert.

510
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,826
"I will cherish our time forever.

511
01:04:10,863 --> 01:04:13,957
"We were just children
playing on the seashore.

512
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:18,936
"At times, we found a smoother pebble
or a prettier shell than ordinary.

513
01:04:20,973 --> 01:04:24,636
"But the great ocean of truth
lays out there before us...

514
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,837
"untouched and undiscovered.

515
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,172
"If only you'd been a man of action.

516
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,444
"Marie."

517
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:34,379
No, nothing here.

518
01:04:34,654 --> 01:04:36,087
Poor Albert.

519
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:39,682
Hold on. There's an address
on the back of the envelope.

520
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:41,249
"Marie Curie.

521
01:04:41,928 --> 01:04:43,225
"France."

522
01:04:45,598 --> 01:04:47,259
Good luck, Albert.

523
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:13,625
The Academy of Sciences

524
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:22,762
<i>Gentlemen and ladies, welcome.</i>

525
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,326
<i>Tonight we are honored and excited...</i>

526
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:27,929
<i>to have with us</i>
<i>the most distinguished scientists...</i>

527
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,770
<i>of the 20th century.</i>

528
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,571
<i>I wish to personally welcome...</i>

529
01:05:31,644 --> 01:05:34,306
<i>Marconi wireless listeners</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

530
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,907
<i>Marconi.: The fastest growing name</i>
<i>in broadcasting today.</i>

531
01:05:40,386 --> 01:05:43,878
<i>This year's nominees include</i>
<i>Mr. Thomas Edison...</i>

532
01:05:45,157 --> 01:05:47,990
<i>with his new electric light!</i>

533
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:54,399
<i>This has been an astonishing year</i>
<i>for scientific achievements.</i>

534
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:58,460
<i>From United States of America,</i>
<i>the Wright brothers.</i>

535
01:06:01,941 --> 01:06:04,967
What did you all say
you did again? Psycho....

536
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:06,835
Psychoanalysis.

537
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:11,607
<i>Psychiatric scientist from Austria,</i>
<i>Prof. Sigmund Freud.</i>

538
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:15,151
<i>Prof. Freud is here tonight</i>
<i>with his mother.</i>

539
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,952
Sigmund, don't pick your nose!

540
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:27,128
THE RENTAL

541
01:06:37,376 --> 01:06:39,708
<i>Marconi is broadcasting live...</i>

542
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:42,976
<i>from the Science Academy here in Paris.</i>
<i>And now....</i>

543
01:06:47,453 --> 01:06:50,115
A woman's place is in the home, <i>Maman.</i>

544
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:52,419
Louis.

545
01:06:53,959 --> 01:06:57,622
All this science of hers,
it will amount to nothing.

546
01:06:57,897 --> 01:07:00,229
She won the Nobel Prize, Pierre.

547
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:03,328
And this year she won the award...

548
01:07:03,402 --> 01:07:07,133
for the best scientific achievement
by a woman.

549
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,376
That is my point, <i>Maman.</i> She is a woman.

550
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:16,408
She needs a man, not a test tube.

551
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,125
Marie, go and see who it is.

552
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:36,132
<i>Oui,</i> Papa.

553
01:07:39,171 --> 01:07:41,162
-Watch it, mate.
-Albert.

554
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:47,069
Marie, I decided that you were right.
We have to talk.

555
01:07:48,013 --> 01:07:49,139
Talk?

556
01:07:49,582 --> 01:07:53,143
It could vaporize the world,
and you want to talk?

557
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:55,383
Louis, throw him out.

558
01:07:56,756 --> 01:07:57,916
And stay out!

559
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,151
-Who is it?
-He's nobody.

560
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:01,420
He?

561
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,926
-Who is this barbarian?
-I'm a Tasmanian.

562
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:14,131
<i>Maman, Papa,</i> this is Albert Einstein.

563
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:20,340
Mr. Curie, I'll be taking Marie
to the Science Academy Awards tonight.

564
01:08:20,412 --> 01:08:24,280
That is impossible.
Paris is hundreds of kilometers away.

565
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,750
Besides, the ceremony
has already started.

566
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:28,912
Mr. Curie, I couldn't help but notice...

567
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:31,684
you've got a hot-air balloon
parked out the front.

568
01:08:31,757 --> 01:08:34,282
I'll be needing to borrow it for the evening.

569
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,988
It is almost out of gas at the moment.

570
01:08:39,231 --> 01:08:42,962
Sir, this is a question
of survival of life on this planet.

571
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:55,206
<i>Worldwide listeners,</i>
<i>the moment we have all been waiting for.</i>

572
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:02,244
<i>The president</i>
<i>of the International Science Academy...</i>

573
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:06,621
<i>the most distinguished scientist</i>
<i>in the world...</i>

574
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,292
<i>Sir Charles Darwin!</i>

575
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,774
<i>Bravo!</i>

576
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:46,725
<i>It is my pleasure to announce...</i>

577
01:09:50,536 --> 01:09:53,232
<i>the 1906 Science Academy Award.</i>

578
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,810
<i>So, who will win?</i>

579
01:10:05,885 --> 01:10:07,375
<i>Nobody knows.</i>

580
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:13,016
What would you say
to a bit of light entertainment, Mother?

581
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:15,856
A bit early in the day for that, Father.

582
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:20,095
I was referring to the wireless.

583
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:40,611
<i>It is my privilege...</i>

584
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,681
<i>to introduce a young man...</i>

585
01:10:43,756 --> 01:10:46,452
<i>who's come all the way...</i>

586
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:49,992
<i>from Australia.</i>

587
01:10:50,796 --> 01:10:53,492
<i>Tonight he's going to show us...</i>

588
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:57,626
<i>a most remarkable scientific formula.</i>

589
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,863
It couldn't be.

590
01:11:06,545 --> 01:11:09,139
<i>Mr. Preston Preston.</i>

591
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:14,947
Thank you, Sir Charles. A great pleasure.

592
01:11:22,328 --> 01:11:26,025
<i>Since mankind</i>
<i>came down from the trees...</i>

593
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,702
<i>he has sought the elusive formula...</i>

594
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:34,830
<i>that would put bubbles into his beer.</i>

595
01:11:35,975 --> 01:11:38,409
<i>I have made it my life's quest...</i>

596
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:41,569
<i>to discover that formula.</i>

597
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:46,516
<i>Now here it is!</i>

598
01:12:06,705 --> 01:12:09,868
-There's the science academy, Marie.
<i>-Oui,</i> Albert.

599
01:12:09,942 --> 01:12:11,705
I'm taking her down.

600
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:30,459
-Quickly.
-I'll let some more air out of the balloon.

601
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:17,769
An atomic chamber?

602
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:21,335
But that would split millions of atoms.

603
01:13:21,413 --> 01:13:23,313
We have to tell Darwin.

604
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:29,018
And now, fellow scientists,
the world's first--

605
01:13:29,088 --> 01:13:30,487
Mr. Darwin.

606
01:13:33,592 --> 01:13:36,254
Preston's built an atomic bomb.

607
01:13:37,463 --> 01:13:38,862
<i>Atomic bomb?</i>

608
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:40,057
What?

609
01:13:40,132 --> 01:13:41,429
No, I didn't!

610
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:45,960
Mr. Preston, do you know what happens
if you split an atom at its nucleus?

611
01:13:46,038 --> 01:13:47,562
Atomic fission.

612
01:13:48,607 --> 01:13:51,167
This man is an escaped lunatic.

613
01:13:55,647 --> 01:13:59,083
That barrel is a gigantic atomic bomb.

614
01:14:00,886 --> 01:14:03,719
Mr. Preston. Stop!

615
01:14:04,423 --> 01:14:08,086
It's harmless, you stupid old man! Look.

616
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,357
It is a bomb.

617
01:14:35,287 --> 01:14:38,085
Albert, if the bomb goes off, then....

618
01:14:39,124 --> 01:14:41,854
Just a moment, Marie. I'm having an idea.

619
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:54,228
Save me. Where do I run?

620
01:14:55,941 --> 01:14:58,375
It's an atomic bomb, Mr. Preston.

621
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:01,711
There's nowhere to run to.

622
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,861
Albert, what are you doing?

623
01:15:50,929 --> 01:15:53,796
Well, I'm going to use this instrument...

624
01:15:55,033 --> 01:15:57,934
to drain the atomic energy
out of that bomb.

625
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:02,535
But you cannot. You cannot reverse
an atomic chain reaction.

626
01:16:02,908 --> 01:16:04,876
Better stand back, Marie.

627
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:27,865
-That's Albert's music.
-Yes. Crikey, yes.

628
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,899
-It's 4/4 time.
-4/4 time.

629
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,972
That'll drain the power out of anything.

630
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:47,381
It's working.

631
01:16:47,452 --> 01:16:50,785
Whatever you are doing, keep doing it.
It's working!

632
01:17:00,732 --> 01:17:04,327
It's all his fault. Albert Einstein.

633
01:17:04,569 --> 01:17:07,436
What kind of a name is that
for a scientist?

634
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:17,278
How am I doing, Marie?

635
01:17:55,687 --> 01:17:57,154
Albert!

636
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:07,925
You are absorbing too much energy.
You will be killed.

637
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:18,939
I'm all right, Marie. They're only electrons.

638
01:19:25,777 --> 01:19:28,575
Get your hands off me!
You call yourselves scientists?

639
01:20:27,005 --> 01:20:29,769
Albert. Is that you?

640
01:20:33,378 --> 01:20:34,970
Look, Dad.

641
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,118
What's happening, Father?

642
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:52,958
Albert.

643
01:21:09,314 --> 01:21:10,372
Dad.

644
01:21:11,716 --> 01:21:12,842
My son.

645
01:21:12,918 --> 01:21:15,944
Mom, I'd like to meet my girlfriend, Marie.

646
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,920
Marie, I'd like you to meet my mom.

647
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:23,458
Hello, dear.

648
01:21:26,765 --> 01:21:29,859
I'm going to ask Albert Einstein
for a private science lesson.

649
01:21:29,935 --> 01:21:32,335
-I saw him first.
-So what?

650
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:35,671
The boy's finally done it, Mother.

651
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:39,767
He's registered the theory "Emc."
We'll be rich.

652
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,416
Dad, Mom, Marie...

653
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:50,417
I've decided to donate my theory
to all the nations of the world...

654
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:53,889
to be used peacefully
for the benefit of all mankind.

655
01:21:53,959 --> 01:21:57,554
But, Albert,
what if the governments of the world...

656
01:21:57,629 --> 01:22:00,257
use your theory to make atomic bombs?

657
01:22:00,565 --> 01:22:05,332
Marie, if you can't trust the governments
of the world, then who can you trust?

658
01:22:10,308 --> 01:22:12,173
Speech!

659
01:22:12,644 --> 01:22:14,612
Come and give a speech.

660
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,011
Come on, Albert! Speech.

661
01:22:20,485 --> 01:22:21,543
No.

662
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,821
<i>I could tell you my latest theory.</i>

663
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,822
Albert's beer, mate.

664
01:30:41,385 --> 01:30:42,409
English
