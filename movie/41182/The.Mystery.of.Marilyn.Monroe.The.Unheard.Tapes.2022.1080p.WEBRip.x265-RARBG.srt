1
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,200
Oh, uh, I'd like to ask you,

2
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,880
how do you go about writing a life story?

3
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,400
Because…

4
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,280
…the true things
rarely get into circulation.

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,600
It's usually the false things.

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,000
If you ever get any of those things
you want to ask, I'll tell you.

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,200
All of those things come from the truth,
you know?

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Because otherwise,
it's hard to know where to start

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
if you don't start with the truth.

10
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,160
After 20 years,
it's time to clear up this case.

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,720
Monroe died
from an overdose of sleeping pills.

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,520
Speculation surrounding Monroe's death
continues to this day.

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,760
The charge is
Marilyn Monroe was murdered.

14
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,560
Someone in the CIA killed Monroe.

15
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,880
She was very frightened.

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,440
There's a great myth around her.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
I hope your phone is clean.

18
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,240
Nobody ever knew everything.

19
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,680
Marilyn Monroe,
the Golden Girl of Hollywood.

20
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,120
The dazzling fame of Marilyn Monroe

21
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,800
delights the critics
and attracts the public in swarms.

22
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,400
Marilyn Monroe was this era's sex symbol.

23
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,920
Marilyn Monroe trod
the summit of her profession.

24
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
Something remarkable happened

25
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,640
when she stepped before a camera.

26
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
A queen in her own realm of entertainment.

27
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
She was adored by millions.

28
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,240
A self-illuminating body, a star.

29
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Tony, I have often said
that I could put together

30
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,000
a scenario that would absolutely
blow the minds of anybody who read it,

31
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,280
but it would be terribly costly
to government agencies,

32
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,600
friends of mine, to people I know.

33
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
- Yeah.
-I don't think I want to do that.

34
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,360
But I never talk
to the press ever, ever, ever.

35
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,880
But I can't say anything,
and I knew it all.

36
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
- Except it's a waste of your time.
- Why?

37
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,400
I don't want to be the one
who sets the record straight.

38
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,360
-But, I mean, I don't know you.
- Fine.

39
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,600
Let it be.

40
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,320
Hollywood,

41
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,960
brilliant tinsel city
of lights and fantasy.

42
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,040
Hollywood,

43
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,560
glorified, glittering, fascinating,
fabulous mythical kingdom.

44
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,120
Hollywood,
the glamour capital of the world.

45
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,960
When I was a kid, and I remember
at the movies on Saturday afternoon…

46
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,760
Let's take a spin down
the Boulevard and see what we can find!

47
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,720
…I'd never come out
of the movie. They'd have to come get me.

48
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,520
Ah, Garbo!

49
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,160
Bad, good, didn't matter.

50
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,560
Hollywood's playground!

51
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,800
Anything that would move
on the screen.

52
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,880
And here inside the gates,

53
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
there's more stars than the Milky Way!

54
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,840
If you don't believe it, just follow us!

55
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,400
My favorite was Jean Harlow.

56
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,000
-She had white hair.
-

57
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,960
The one and only Marlene Dietrich!

58
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,760
Cary Grant arrives with his best grin.

59
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,520
As usual, Cary has
a genial greeting for everybody!

60
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
And Clark Gable.

61
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,240
Clark walked
into the forecourt…

62
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,680
The crowd is still shouting
for their favorite!

63
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,840
Although I was a kid
and I didn't know anything about acting,

64
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
I…

65
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,440
I wanted to know.

66
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Talking.

67
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,680
Yup.

68
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,560
-Marilyn Monroe. I knew her very well.
- You did?

69
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,920
- I'm talking about in the beginning.
- Yes.

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,960
- When she was a kid.
- At that time--

71
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,480
Well, I was… Al Rosen Agency was
one of the top agencies in the business.

72
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,320
- Right.
- I handled Cary Grant, Fredric March.

73
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,760
-Jack Oakie, Judy Garland, you know.
- Right.

74
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,480
But, you see,
the history of this business is

75
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,440
you got one thing, I'll guarantee it,
which you didn't know about.

76
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,360
-In this business, in the golden years…
- Yeah.

77
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,760
…every casting director,
every studio used to have a black book,

78
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,120
you know what I mean?

79
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,520
So, every girl, you know, I'm talking
about kids that were breaking in,

80
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,680
like Marilyn Monroe,
you know, when they get started,

81
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,720
all the casting directors,

82
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,720
they would write in their black book
who could be laid.

83
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,320
You see, the business
has changed since then.

84
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Today, it's the buck.

85
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,440
It used to be sex. Remember that.

86
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,120
Calling all girls!
Calling all girls!

87
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,160
And now, all those lovely hopefuls
have their chance.

88
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,200
The process of selecting
just the right girls is a careful one.

89
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,800
My, my,
what a smart looking crowd.

90
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,280
Isn't she a honey?

91
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,440
Isn't she sweet?

92
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,040
Neck, 12 and a half.

93
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,760
Bust, 34 and a half.

94
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,160
Pride. Adventure. Ambition.

95
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,920
From the ends of the Earth they come,
waiting for the magic call.

96
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,000
Hello?

97
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
How can I help you?

98
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,960
Well, my husband knew her first,
early '40s.

99
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,280
Oh, yes.

100
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,640
You know, a generous girl,
warm girl, really rather lovable.

101
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,480
She was very much on the restaurant scene
and the club scene.

102
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,080
- But at Romanoff's.
- Yeah. Enormous fun.

103
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
And it was quite exotic.

104
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
It had a real mélange of people,

105
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,800
and it was sort of the mecca for agents.

106
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,840
It had all of the film VIPs.

107
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,720
-All the pretty girls hung out there.
- Right.

108
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,440
And Marilyn was among them,
of course.

109
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,400
So young is Hollywood

110
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,040
that many of its earliest pioneers
are still active in the industry.

111
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,680
Men like Joseph Schenck,
chairman of the board of 20th Century Fox.

112
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,320
Mr. Schenck brought about an era
of epic, dramatic screen stories.

113
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,800
Oh, sure. Schenck was a human being.

114
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,520
-You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

115
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,880
She had a bunch of 'em.
He wasn't the only one.

116
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,920
There were a group
who gathered at Schenck's.

117
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,320
-She was always very much at his house.
- Yeah.

118
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,360
And she was beginning
to make a few strides.

119
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,760
In 1948.

120
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,680
Johnny Hyde,

121
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,720
who was a dear little man,
wonderful little man…

122
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,240
-You know about him?
- Yes.

123
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,040
- Johnny was in love with her.
- Yeah.

124
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,600
Johnny Hyde spoke to me
about her first

125
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,880
and then brought her over to Metro.

126
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,160
Just, uh, very fresh.

127
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
Very attractive.

128
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,160
Rather timid.

129
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,200
Shy.

130
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,080
And, um we talked to her
and gave her a script.

131
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,000
She went away
and came back a day or two later,

132
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,720
and, well, Marilyn read her lines,

133
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,600
and she read them very beautifully,
very well.

134
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,040
And there was no question.

135
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,480
She was ideal for the part.

136
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,000
- In The Asphalt Jungle?
-Yes, indeed.

137
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
That was that.

138
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,680
Only once in a decade
does the screen come up with

139
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,400
such absorbing characters.

140
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,680
Marilyn Monroe as Angela,
the easy-living, green-eyed blonde.

141
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,720
Marilyn went right down
into her own personal experience

142
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,960
for everything.

143
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,880
She would reach down
and pull something out of herself

144
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,160
that was unique and extraordinary.

145
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,600
She found things
about womankind in herself.

146
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,040
She had no technique.

147
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,520
It was all the truth.

148
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,280
It was only Marilyn,
but she was Marilyn plus.

149
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,520
An award to the popular new star.

150
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,560
And as best young box office personality,
Miss Marilyn Monroe.

151
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,760
Thank you, Mr. Nichols.

152
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,240
It's Marilyn Monroe,
skyrocketing to new dramatic heights.

153
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,960
Marilyn Monroe,
all the moviegoers of America voted you

154
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,480
the most popular actress of the year.
My congratulations.

155
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
Thank you, Mr. Sammis.

156
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,320
-Congratulations!
-Thank you, Lauren.

157
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,280
And my thanks to Look magazine.

158
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,480
A Hollywood incident
that marks another salute

159
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
to Marilyn Monroe.

160
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,560
Thank you. I thank you very much.

161
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,560
And now here comes
a young lady who has

162
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,800
created a real sensation
in the picture business,

163
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,720
having won all kinds of awards
as the number one newcomer of the year.

164
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,760
And believe me, a swell gal with a…

165
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,880
Take it from me, I've known her
a long time, Miss Marilyn Monroe!

166
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,200
Let's hear it! Come on out here, Marilyn!

167
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,200
With Marilyn Monroe
and Jane Russell.

168
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,880
Yes.

169
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
She was very bright,
and she wanted to learn

170
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,200
and was interested in everything to,

171
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,320
-you know, help her control her career.
- Right.

172
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,680
And every night after work,
she would go to the coach.

173
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,200
- Yes.
- We were going home exhausted.

174
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,760
She'd go to the coach.

175
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,680
But she wanted to be good.

176
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,520
Then when…

177
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,080
…the camera went on, it was like a whole
electric light went on in the, you know…

178
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,800
They just came to life.

179
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,480
I just felt like I was
on the outside of the world,

180
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,760
and suddenly everything opened up.

181
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,680
The world became friendly.
It opened up to me.

182
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,440
I said, "Gee, what happened?"

183
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,000
If I am a star,
the people made me a star.

184
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,320
But I do want to be wonderful, you know.

185
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,760
I want to do the best
that I can do in that moment.

186
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,200
When the camera starts until it stops.

187
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,120
That moment
I want to be… perfect.

188
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,480
I'll tell you,

189
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,680
I'm terribly grateful

190
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,280
because I remember when…

191
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,920
things weren't like this at all.

192
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,080
I saw her a time or two.

193
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,400
-Years had gone by.
- Yeah.

194
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,880
By now she was dressed
to the T's, and she'd become the…

195
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,920
The sex symbol of this country.

196
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,960
And it wasn't…
It wasn't just a sex thing at all.

197
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,920
Women felt just the same as men.

198
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,600
There was something deeply moving
about Marilyn, always.

199
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,880
We were close during the picture,

200
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,560
and then we were… we, you know,
considered ourselves friends,

201
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,800
but Marilyn kind of went
from one group to another.

202
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,680
She would take off,
and it would be another group.

203
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,240
That would become the shell for a time.

204
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,800
She didn't go back
and seek out any of the people

205
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,680
that had become close to her.

206
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,280
There was something
so vulnerable, so…

207
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,360
Something you felt

208
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,400
could be easily destroyed.

209
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,240
- Hello?
- Hi.

210
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,920
Well, I hated Hollywood.
My family knew enough Hollywood people.

211
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,960
You know, I had, at times,
met movie stars at parties

212
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,720
and found the whole thing to be obnoxious.

213
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,400
My notion was these people were…
were phoneys and narcissistic characters.

214
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,440
I hated 'em.

215
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,560
So when I heard
that Dad was seeing Marilyn,

216
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,280
I was not jumping up and down
and cheering.

217
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,600
He couldn't see her at the office.
She was too goddamn famous.

218
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,720
He was seeing her at home.
I thought, "What a bunch of bullshit."

219
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,520
I mean,
here's the sex symbol of the world.

220
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,560
Here is, you know,
what womanhood should be in a nutshell.

221
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,160
I mean,
there was something about Marilyn

222
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,400
-that put her apart from everybody else.
- Yeah.

223
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,280
But there were times, you know, that
I would pick her up in my Hillman Minx,

224
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,600
-you know, and…
- Yeah.

225
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,800
Marilyn without makeup and a scarf
over her hair and just sitting there,

226
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,880
you know, you wouldn't think
would attract any kind of attention,

227
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,640
and yet, you know, I would suddenly
have five people washing my windows.

228
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
-But there was just something.
- Yeah.

229
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,960
It happened to me too.

230
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,760
No! No!

231
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,360
There was an at-homeness
with her body

232
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,240
that very…
I have never seen anybody else have.

233
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,240
To be sort of almost animallike

234
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,320
in their feel and their movement and…

235
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,600
You know, beautiful
and very, in a sense, poetic.

236
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,280
And I'm not calling myself an orphan.

237
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,960
I was brought up a waif.

238
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,080
Yeah, I was never used to being happy.

239
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,320
So that wasn't something
I was sort of counting on.

240
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,600
In all the years
he'd been doing that,

241
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,000
my father had never had
a patient commit suicide.

242
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,360
He never treated anybody
as unorthodoxly as he was treating her.

243
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,040
His feeling was that because of who
she was, she could never be hospitalized.

244
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,520
So given that he couldn't do that,

245
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,320
his feeling was the best shot he had

246
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,320
was to try to treat her
in this highly unusual,

247
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,440
unorthodox kind of way that he did.

248
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,080
She starts hanging out with the family.

249
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,720
That's how a sort of more
of a friendliness then came about.

250
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,520
Before dinner, they would have cocktails.

251
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,760
And that would be where the sort of
predinner conversation would go on.

252
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,240
She had a… a mind that searched

253
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,920
and an honest mind that tried
to find whatever her truths were.

254
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,200
It must have been
somewhere along the line

255
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,000
that I began to talk to her.

256
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,520
And it was in that particular setting
that I slowly but surely got to know her,

257
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,360
because I certainly know
that my opinion changes.

258
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,960
Within that family,
I was the new arrived left-winger.

259
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,720
So, but we'd get into these conversations,

260
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,360
and lo and behold, you know,
Marilyn would end up on my side.

261
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,080
- Right.
- So a friendship developed.

262
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,680
I began to like her and to recognize
that there was more to this person

263
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,200
than, uh… than met the eye.

264
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,200
Well, Marilyn told me that
there was a new man in her life.

265
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,640
No, that he was just, you know…
you know, really terrific.

266
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,960
-Neat.
-And he was really neat

267
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,520
and, you know, cute and…

268
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,960
I mean, it was that kind of…
I mean, I remember--

269
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,840
-It was girly talk.
- It was girly talk.

270
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,160
I mean, the…

271
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,240
She said that this person was so important
that she wouldn't tell me who it was.

272
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
Calling him "the general."

273
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,000
She was calling him "the general."

274
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,920
-The general.
-

275
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,840
And I remember feeling
that it was real…

276
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,880
You know, it was real peculiar that
here I'm sitting with Marilyn Monroe.

277
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,680
We're talking about boyfriends, and
I'm meeting some schlub at art school.

278
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,800
I know that she's talking about somebody
that's very big in the government.

279
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,200
And… and it sort of struck me as…

280
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,160
- Somehow this is bizarre.
- You mean, you knew already--

281
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,520
So I didn't know whether
it was Bobby or the president.

282
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,720
- Yeah.
- It was simply titillating.

283
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,920
I mean, I don't even remember
the guy I had a crush on back then,

284
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,440
but it was certainly somebody
that wasn't gonna hold a candle to that.

285
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,520
Yeah.

286
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,960
There was more
to this person than met the eye.

287
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Family.

288
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,120
The general.

289
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,600
This person was so important.

290
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,560
Joe DiMaggio!
Smacked one out of the park!

291
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,000
What a hit!
Into the upper deck in left center field!

292
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,520
He was a wonderful athlete.

293
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,800
DiMaggio connects.

294
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,320
I met him…
he had already retired.

295
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,640
I had very few friends.

296
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,840
It's just that

297
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,920
I like people,

298
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,800
but for friends, I like few people.

299
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,560
But I think she was
quite taken with DiMaggio.

300
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,040
I saw him for around a year
and a half, two years, and we married.

301
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,360
Romance that thrills the world!

302
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,360
The marriage of Marilyn Monroe
and Joe DiMaggio.

303
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,840
The girl who starred in
How to Marry a Millionaire,

304
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,520
giving another starring performance
in How to Marry a Baseball Hero,

305
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,600
and now the pair are off
for their happy honeymoon.

306
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,840
He understood
some things about me, and…

307
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,520
I understood some things about him.

308
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,520
We based our marriage on it.

309
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,360
And I say some things.

310
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,880
How have you and Mrs. DiMaggio
enjoyed your trip to Japan?

311
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,800
Everything has been fine.
We've enjoyed our trip.

312
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,000
The only thing that I have to complain
about is I haven't seen much of Marilyn.

313
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
She is making a trip to Korea,

314
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,720
touring through the camps and so,

315
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,680
maybe after that we'll be able
to spend a little time together.

316
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,440
I mean, I really don't think
they had a lot in common.

317
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,200
I think she was very touched
by his genuine concern for her.

318
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,440
But then quite soon bored…

319
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,080
with his over-possessiveness.

320
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,560
Well, we're here to make
The Seven Year Itch.

321
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,360
- That's your latest picture?
-Yes.

322
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,600
I'm looking forward
to working in it very much.

323
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,120
I hear that you're getting
to be quite a cook too.

324
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,400
Joe says you can
really broil a mean steak.

325
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,320
Well, I'm learning.

326
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,960
A little slow, but…

327
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,520
Okay.

328
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,560
We were shooting
Seven Year Itch with Marilyn Monroe.

329
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,760
And do you remember that famous shot?

330
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,960
Do you remember the wind
that is lifting her skirt?

331
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,520
Do you feel the breeze from the subway?

332
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,880
Isn't it delicious?

333
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,360
Oh! Here comes another one!

334
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,200
Well, we were all set up
to shoot that scene, you know.

335
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,760
There were five
and ultimately 10,000 people.

336
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,680
They were like, uh…
and look up Marilyn's skirt.

337
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,880
And…

338
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,280
people were heckling from the sidelines,

339
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,560
and people were running up for autographs.

340
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,480
I did Seven Year Itch.

341
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,320
Yeah.
Joe got very upset about it.

342
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,720
- Did he really or was that--
- Really!

343
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,840
Joe DiMaggio, you know,
he was watching it,

344
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,440
and he didn't like it very much,

345
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,480
his wife making a spectacle of herself.

346
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,440
They had a suite
in a real old, beautiful hotel.

347
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,600
-And he… beat her up a little bit.
- Huh.

348
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,440
Marilyn said
that she screamed and yelled for us.

349
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,200
But we couldn't hear her
through those thick walls, you know.

350
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,960
- It was more on her shoulders.
- Yeah.

351
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,440
But with a little makeup and everything,
she went ahead and worked.

352
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,040
Our marriage wasn't a happy one.
It ended in,

353
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,040
uh, nine months,

354
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,480
unfortunately.

355
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,400
I don't know what else to say.

356
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,640
All I can say as her attorney is that

357
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
this is what we would say
was a conflict of careers.

358
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,880
Has Joe moved out finally?

359
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,480
- Okay, Jerry!
-I'm sorry. I have to go.

360
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
My dad had told me…

361
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,240
that she got depressed at times.

362
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,920
About how terrible she felt about herself.

363
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,680
"Nothing would ever turn out right."

364
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,160
"Nothing would go my way."

365
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,360
How do you feel about
coming back to Hollywood?

366
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,120
A happy time for you--

367
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,000
Yes, it is. It's a very happy time.
I'm happy to be back.

368
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,000
-In my hometown.
- Yes.

369
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,840
Well,
you're a happy girl now?

370
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,160
And she talked about this
whole litany of depressive thought.

371
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,080
"Nobody likes me."

372
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,200
"Everything I do turns to shit."

373
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,280
"I don't have anybody."

374
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,000
"I'm a waif."

375
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,480
Marilyn,
all we know in New York

376
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,520
is that you and Joe DiMaggio
are friends at a distance.

377
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,960
How great a distance?

378
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,320
Well, we haven't seen each other.

379
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,360
Do you hear from each other?
Do you write or talk?

380
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,800
-Um, I'd rather not answer.
- All right, fine.

381
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,680
Well, when I was put
in the orphans' home,

382
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,480
they pulled me, and I kept crying
and screaming, "I'm not an orphan."

383
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,040
I called every woman I would see,
I'd say, "There's a mama."

384
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,880
If I would see a man,
I'd say, "There's a daddy."

385
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,800
I don't think I have
really too much to say about it except

386
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,000
I… I liked her, and…

387
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,360
and we'd talk a lot.

388
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,080
I was at the Strasbergs' parties
with her a lot.

389
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,920
She… she seemed a little bit, um…

390
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,240
She seemed concerned about, uh,

391
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,120
you know, like childhood memories of…

392
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,880
of being molested as a child,
things like that.

393
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
She talked about that, I remember.

394
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,800
She felt that she had avoided…

395
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,280
That she knew people
who were psychotic from such episodes,

396
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,360
and she felt that at least
she'd survived that.

397
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,600
-
- I was a very, very close friend

398
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,360
and was friends to the end.

399
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,840
She wanted to know her father
so badly.

400
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,080
I remember a party
and this game we'd play.

401
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,000
Everybody said what
they'd want most in the world.

402
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,480
And she said she'd want
to put on a black wig,

403
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
pick up her father at a bar,

404
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,400
have him make love to her,

405
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,240
and then she'd say, "Well, how does
it feel now to have a daughter

406
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,600
that you've made love to?"

407
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,200
We all need to get out
of childhood in one piece,

408
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,000
but if nowhere along the line
did you get that sort of reinforcement

409
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,480
that you are worth love, you're lovable,
that there's something in you,

410
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,080
that we're a good person,

411
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,720
what you end up with
is a sort of emptiness.

412
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,880
We were friends prior to the marriage.

413
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,160
Many years before that.

414
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,040
See, my father owned half
of Republic Studios at one time.

415
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,360
-So I grew up with these people.
- Uh-huh.

416
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,280
But, uh, I think the greatest effect
of all was Arthur Miller.

417
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,720
Yes.

418
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
The Arthur Miller situation.

419
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,760
How long have you known
Miss Monroe, Mr. Miller?

420
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,000
I met her a long time ago,
but I hadn't seen her in years.

421
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,440
But I think I've got the woman
who is going to be my wife.

422
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,600
- You mean Marilyn Monroe?
-That's correct.

423
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
When are you planning
to have children?

424
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,920
Well, I'm not married yet, dear.

425
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,960
This is a personal question.

426
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,080
Is there anything in particular
about Mr. Miller that attracted you?

427
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,600
-Have you seen him?
- Yes.

428
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
-Yes!
-

429
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,400
I think she was quite intrigued
by people she thought to be bright.

430
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,360
That would have been my impression.

431
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,960
What I'd like to accomplish,
I would like to be a good actress.

432
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,000
A true actress. An artist, with integrity.

433
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,520
She had very strong goals
for herself.

434
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,400
She was so bright about acting.

435
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,400
She'd come over, sit with me
at the Studio and things like that.

436
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,880
She'd figure out what
she wanted to do with the scene.

437
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,040
She really… she really cared.

438
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,400
I think love and work are
the only things that really happen to us.

439
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,840
Arthur Miller thought
she was intelligent

440
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,200
and had a brain that was never cultivated.

441
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,760
And that's where he courted her.

442
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,880
- That's correct.
-

443
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,120
Ms. Monroe, could you tell us
what kind of a wedding you're gonna have?

444
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,480
Very quiet, I hope.

445
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,000
Studio.

446
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,520
- Can I speak to Milton Greene?
- Speaking.

447
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,000
Close friend and associate.
We loved each other, period.

448
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,960
She was. She really was.
She wanted a baby.

449
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,480
In fact, during Prince and the Showgirl,

450
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,800
she said, when it's over,
she's gonna go home and have a baby.

451
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,600
And I said, "Well, great."

452
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,400
"Get the white picket fence,
and I think it's a good idea."

453
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,840
If you gave her a choice
between children and stardom,

454
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,320
it would have been children…

455
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,920
without question.

456
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,360
There were some photographs,

457
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,480
I think it was a picture of her
and Miller's father.

458
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,320
And she said to me,

459
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
"This is my happiest period."

460
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,000
And I asked her why.

461
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,760
She showed me the picture
and said, "I was pregnant then."

462
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,840
Yes, she was pregnant by Miller
during Some Like It Hot.

463
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,760
If you watched her

464
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,200
in the picture that I worked
with her on called Some Like It Hot…

465
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,280
- Right. One of my favorites.
- She was so wonderful.

466
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,720
All the way through.

467
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,040
- From the start? Gosh.
-Yes.

468
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,160
She had a very naive quality
about her, very soft, gentle quality.

469
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,800
That's the way she could be,
you see.

470
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,960
That's the way she was,
not could be. She was evanescent.

471
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,040
-♪ To anything higher… ♪
-And I…

472
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,480
Well, uh, she wasn't happy many times,
Mr. Summers.

473
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,080
I… I remember…

474
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,920
Everything connects in a person's life,
particularly hers, you know?

475
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,120
And it's sad.

476
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,040
She was slightly
discombobulated at all times.

477
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,200
But by God,
when you suffered through that scene,

478
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,760
through the 30, 40, 50 takes sometimes,

479
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,480
you had something there, you know.

480
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,640
Something absolutely unique
that cannot be duplicated.

481
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,920
I had no problem with Monroe.
Monroe had problems with Monroe.

482
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
She had problems with herself.

483
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,320
I can give you the reason
for that one.

484
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,120
But I can't say anything.
And I knew it all.

485
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,080
I'm awfully sorry.

486
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,280
You sound very nice, but I really…
It makes me unhappy to talk about it.

487
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,480
It really does.

488
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,800
- You know you--
- She's been gone 20 years…

489
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,360
- Oh yes.
-…Mr. Summers.

490
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,000
I can't bring myself
to talk about it.

491
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,480
Just being able to be

492
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,960
another human being,

493
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,520
to be someplace…

494
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,920
Having certain kinds
of secrets for yourself.

495
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,960
There is a need for aloneness, you know?

496
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,520
I was aware from the--
Yes, I was aware from the beginning.

497
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,240
And I saw there was
something that she was…

498
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,760
She was not the fresh little girl
that I'd known originally.

499
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,760
Very soon we were aware
that she was a problem.

500
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,240
She'd be late on the set always.

501
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,680
Sometimes the whole morning would go by.

502
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,880
Sometimes she'd be all right.

503
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,480
Occasionally,
she'd be practically non compos mentis.

504
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,360
The narcotics were the problem.

505
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,120
I discovered this
in the course of the picture.

506
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,120
I remember saying to Miller one day…

507
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,880
I said, you know, that if she went
on at the rate that she was going,

508
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,640
why, she'd be in an institution
in two or three years, or dead!

509
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,640
And I said anyone who allows her
to take a drug ought to be shot.

510
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,960
It was almost an accusation against him.

511
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,640
An indictment against Miller.

512
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,600
At the end of the shooting of Misfits.

513
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,880
Happiness…

514
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,680
Does one ever know that?

515
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,640
Marilyn!

516
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,440
Marilyn!

517
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,680
I feel wonderful. Thank you.

518
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,560
Here she was now,
again divorced and terribly lonely.

519
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That's when the Kennedys
came back in there.

520
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,520
- Right.
-

521
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,000
- Were you aware of that?
- Oh, yes.

522
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,440
But Jack,
that started in the early and mid '50s.

523
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,840
-Yes!
- Uh-huh.

524
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,440
Oh, of course it did.

525
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,800
He'd been out here
on and off all through the '50s.

526
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,400
'Cause he had lots of friends here,
you know,

527
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,800
spending lots of time, you know.

528
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,240
- He used the Malibu Inn.
- Yes.

529
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,080
- And drank at the Malibu Cottage.
- Uh-huh.

530
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,480
The raunchiest looking thing
you've ever seen in your life.

531
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,080
-Oh yeah, because Jack wasn't known…
- Yeah.

532
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,040
…here at all.

533
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,960
He was a senator.
He was totally unknown here.

534
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,960
I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy,
do solemnly swear…

535
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,480
No one ever expected Jack to
become the president or the nominee.

536
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,120
…and I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States.

537
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,000
And will to the best of your ability…

538
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,080
He's just some smart-ass
rich kid's son that became senator.

539
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,280
Preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States.

540
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,560
So help you God.

541
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,920
So help me God.

542
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,080
After Jack.

543
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,400
Ah, yes.

544
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,240
Yes.

545
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,600
But, in '61,

546
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:41,640
the meeting headquarters
was at Pete Lawford's house

547
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,520
in Malibu.

548
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,320
Just the things
that were going on in that beach house.

549
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,280
Not discreet at all.

550
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,480
Of course, there was nothing discreet
about any of the Kennedys either.

551
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,360
Mm-hmm.
I mean, it was just mind-boggling.

552
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,840
Peter would obviously be, you know,
sort of pimping for both Kennedys.

553
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,440
They would do it
just as soon in front of anybody.

554
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,920
Yeah, their wives
could be in the other room,

555
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,680
and many times were, you know.

556
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,760
Yeah. I mean,
I've had a hand up my breasts.

557
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,920
The president owned it.

558
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,480
Yeah.

559
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,040
Not in the terms that Jack was.

560
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,840
They were tacky, they were corny,
they were… you know, the father was.

561
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,800
They were chips off the old block.

562
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,160
You know, his father
was a bigger wolf than he was!

563
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,280
He came out here,
and he had an office here,

564
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,000
which later became RKO.

565
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,600
See, before, any con artist could come
into the motion picture industry

566
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,560
and make a buck.

567
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,760
And he used to fuck up in his office.

568
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,520
I used to have to wait outside the door,
for chrissakes,

569
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,040
while he was getting laid.

570
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,120
I mean, I'm talking about Joe.

571
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,440
Yeah.

572
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,800
Remember that.

573
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,920
Both.

574
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,040
I do.

575
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,920
It was in the dining room one day,

576
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,280
and she was talking about
going over to Lawford's house.

577
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,240
"I want something to talk to him about."

578
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,760
- Robert Kennedy?
-Right.

579
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,360
We talked about some political questions.
She actually ended up writing them down

580
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,560
and putting them in her purse,
and then she went there.

581
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,840
She was seated with Bobby

582
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,600
and had made some little notes,

583
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,160
feeling that she really wasn't
quite bright enough for the crowd.

584
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,320
And, um, at one point,

585
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,760
he got up and called
his father long-distance

586
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,120
to say that he was seated
with Marilyn Monroe,

587
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,680
and would his father
like to say hello to Marilyn.

588
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,320
- Who?
-This is Bobby.

589
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,920
And I think he asked her to dance.

590
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,160
They did that.

591
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,440
-That goes on…
- Yes, that's what she said

592
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,880
on numerous occasions.

593
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,280
Again, she just didn't lie.
She just spoke quite openly.

594
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,400
Oh, nothing but love.

595
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,040
Nothing but admiration.

596
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,720
Tonight, we go after
the story of a private detective,

597
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,840
who helps Confidential magazine
pry into the lives of Hollywood stars.

598
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,440
An ex-cop, now one of the highest-paid
private detectives in the United States.

599
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,920
He's Fred Otash.

600
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,560
Now then, Fred Otash, you take any case
that pays you money, is that not so?

601
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,360
-Correct?
-That's correct.

602
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,480
Any case at all?

603
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:16,520
I won't take a case for a member
of the Communist Party or a communist.

604
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,560
I sort of draw the line there.

605
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,120
How do you justify
invading people's privacy like that?

606
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,400
Well, I feel this way,
if you can see it or hear it,

607
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,560
you're not invading any privacy.

608
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,400
Being a private detective is a dirty job.
There's no two ways about it.

609
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,840
But I do a certain job,

610
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,240
and I try to determine
if the facts and the items are true.

611
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,480
- You just want the facts?
-That's right. The true facts.

612
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,640
- Fred Otash?
- Yeah.

613
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,280
I worked for and against the Mafia.
I worked for and against law enforcement.

614
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,760
I worked for and against the White House.

615
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,600
And I worked for Hoffa.

616
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,760
You can't be head of the Teamsters
unless you're approved by the Mob.

617
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,360
Hoffa was the Mob.

618
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,920
- Where'd you get the money?
- What'd you say?

619
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,760
Do you have any evidence
of the $20,000 in cash?

620
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,120
- No.
-Did you receive any of this money?

621
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,400
I don't believe that I did.

622
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,240
Suggest anything to you?

623
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,600
It doesn't suggest anything
except the fact that you're trying again

624
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,080
to embarrass Hoffa. That's all.

625
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,280
Hoffa, he had a vendetta for Bobby.
Kennedy had a vendetta for Hoffa.

626
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,880
Mr. Hoffa, did you say,
"That SOB. I'll break his back."

627
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,040
Figure of speech.
I don't know who I was talking about.

628
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

629
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,360
Hoffa wanted to neutralize Kennedy.

630
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,720
What Hoffa wanted

631
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:23,480
was for me to develop a derogatory profile
on Jack and Bobby Kennedy

632
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,520
and their relationships
with Marilyn Monroe.

633
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,160
And the strategy that was agreed upon
was to use electronic devices,

634
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,800
and the most logical place
to set those devices

635
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,720
was Peter Lawford's home in Malibu.

636
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,840
That was the Kennedy playground.

637
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,400
And wire up Marilyn's home…

638
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,800
in Brentwood.

639
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,160
The house on the Helenas
was the first piece of property that she

640
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,080
ever had owned in her whole life.

641
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,920
And my father encouraged
the whole idea that

642
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,200
she alone as a person could own
and put down roots and have her own place.

643
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,400
It was something
that hadn't occurred to her.

644
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,280
And she was, you know, very excited
about establishing her own sort of family.

645
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,640
What Pop wanted to do was
to have her stand on her own two feet.

646
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,080
But there is something
in people, they want solitude for a while.

647
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,880
That I'm quiet and to myself more.

648
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,840
Somewhere in there,
my dad went away.

649
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,360
- Yeah.
- To Europe.

650
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,080
And he left with her
in fairly decent shape.

651
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,160
But I think she was starting that movie.

652
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,680
In a sense, the less important
we became in her life, the better off.

653
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,760
That meant that she had her own life.

654
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,200
- All right, camera!
- It's 11.

655
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,920
It takes me two seconds. It's taken…

656
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,400
You've… you've had two days.
Sorry, George, but we can do it.

657
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,160
Good, good, good.

658
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,160
All right, cameras!

659
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,200
Yeah, one more.
That was good though, right?

660
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,520
And she would become even more of a star.

661
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,040
I'd have to look into my journal
and see what he said,

662
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,800
-if I wrote it down as a quote.
- I'd be interested in that.

663
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,080
This is a quote.
"Marilyn will turn out to be

664
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,400
the most popular actress of
her generation, probably of this century."

665
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,200
502. Speed.

666
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,040
Mr. Cukor,
on this film, has been

667
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,160
very wonderful to me.

668
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,880
Trying to be happy is almost as difficult
as trying to be a good actress.

669
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,240
You have to work at both of them.

670
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,880
"Her best films
would have come late in her career."

671
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,280
"She had a great untapped
dramatic talent."

672
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,720
But anyway, she was making that movie,
and… my dad, when he left said,

673
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,840
"You guys should try to pitch in."

674
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,200
He wanted to make sure that
she wasn't running into some trouble.

675
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,600
There was always
great danger that she might…

676
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,760
get involved with somebody or something.

677
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,320
The bugs were installed
in the bedrooms and on the phones.

678
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,400
And there were four bugs
altogether installed out there.

679
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,800
They were placed under carpets,

680
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,360
in the chandeliers,
and in ceiling fixtures.

681
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,880
You could wire a telephone
five miles from the location.

682
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,200
I had sent Danoff out there.

683
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,200
John Danoff.

684
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,960
Yes.

685
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:14,640
The conversation
that came across the receiver,

686
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,880
it would fade in and fade out.

687
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,280
Music, people talking,

688
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,960
and I'm then beginning
to recognize the voices,

689
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,320
the Bostonian accent and Marilyn Monroe.

690
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,440
I heard the president
call Marilyn "Marilyn,"

691
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,560
or Marilyn calling the president "Prez."

692
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,240
Any conversations on the phone,

693
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,160
some with Jack Kennedy,
some with Bobby Kennedy,

694
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,080
some with Monroe, some with other people.

695
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,960
Arrangements for meetings,
there were gonna be rendezvous

696
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,160
with Jack Kennedy,
Bobby Kennedy, and Monroe.

697
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:55,200
So there were numerous tapes made
on Marilyn and Jack at the beach house

698
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,760
in the act of lovemaking.

699
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,960
They went into the bedroom
where there was another transmitter,

700
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,680
which picked up cuddly talk
and taking off her clothes,

701
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,640
the sex act in the bed.

702
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,440
And someone wired up Marilyn's house

703
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,880
on behalf of Hoffa.

704
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,080
Bobby Kennedy was there many times.

705
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,040
There were more tapes
made out of Robert Kennedy and Monroe,

706
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,800
as opposed to Jack Kennedy and Monroe.

707
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,280
This is in '62,
shortly before her death.

708
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,920
It must have been that summer.

709
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,520
Whenever she called,

710
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,600
and I would always answer
the attorney general's personal calls,

711
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,560
she would talk to me.

712
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,760
It was as though she were reaching out.

713
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,760
And Bob would call her back,
and they'd talk.

714
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,920
The entire globe,

715
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,320
yesterday, the site
of a momentous conflict.

716
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,880
The conflict which
has become known as the Cold War.

717
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,640
The Communist Bloc
would like to see the world

718
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,160
under communist domination.

719
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,200
Recently, we've seen it
extend into turbulent Cuba.

720
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,520
Does that disturb you? It should.

721
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,400
You are in the crosshairs
of the bombsight.

722
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,280
A massive nuclear
intercontinental capability.

723
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,520
The communist plan for world domination.

724
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,200
It is a contest unlike any we have ever
faced in our history as a nation.

725
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,120
I remember
when she sang for the president.

726
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,680
And she was so excited about it.

727
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,920
'Cause, "Why, the president
of the United States," you know.

728
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,200
You know, it was one of the most
exciting things of her life.

729
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,960
President is winding up his New York day
here at Madison Square Garden

730
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,840
in a sort of pre-birthday celebration.

731
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,320
Mr. Kennedy has the best seat
in the house at the function,

732
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,520
and it will be starting just about now,
the finale for this affair.

733
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,840
Mr. President,

734
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:41,600
on this occasion of your birthday,
this lovely lady, Marilyn Monroe.

735
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,520
Everybody! Happy birthday!

736
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,240
Just being the one to sing.

737
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,800
She was picked.

738
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,360
-
- She was picked.

739
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,800
The one.

740
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,280
We met in Laguna.

741
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,680
A month before she died.

742
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,960
She came down for the weekend.

743
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,760
And… she told us the…

744
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,520
What had really taken place
with the Kennedys.

745
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,240
I can…
You know, I can go into the dirt,

746
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,920
or I can go into lots of other things,

747
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,240
but she… She was…

748
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,480
She was, uh, hurt.

749
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:22,960
Terribly hurt when…
…she was told directly

750
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,920
never to call or contact again.

751
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,720
-Robert or John.
- Right.

752
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,440
Well, no, that was an order.

753
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,600
- No, Jack didn't contact her.
- Yeah.

754
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,800
Bob did.

755
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,600
And that's what killed her.

756
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,920
I don't care
what anyone else says.

757
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,080
It was the beginning of the last day,
if you will.

758
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,920
Prior to her death?

759
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,640
She had been mixing drink
and sleeping pills.

760
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,040
I thought she very definitely
was on the downward path.

761
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,360
And I just never could
quite understand whether

762
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,000
she understood there was help to be had

763
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,200
and people did care about her.

764
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,000
And whether she was just…

765
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,280
letting go.

766
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,400
I like to stay here and now.

767
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,840
Fame is fickle.

768
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,920
It had its compensation.

769
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,200
But… it also has its drawbacks.

770
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,400
And I know it.

771
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,880
I've had you, fame.

772
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,480
So long!

773
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,600
One of the most famous stars
in Hollywood history is dead at 36.

774
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,640
Her housekeeper, Eunice Murray,

775
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,720
found the actress dead in bed,

776
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,000
holding in one hand a telephone,
which was off its hook.

777
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,000
Bottle of sleeping pills near her bed.

778
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,120
No notes were found.

779
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,640
The coroner ruled
the cause of death an overdose of drugs.

780
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,000
It is our opinion, probable suicide.

781
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,440
Well, the official finding
will never tell the story

782
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,200
of her life and end.

783
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,240
I will never forget that night

784
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,720
because we were at the Hollywood Bowl,

785
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,000
and someone, I don't know who it was,
that came to us,

786
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,800
and all I remember
is that we were no longer

787
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,000
at the Hollywood Bowl,
if you know what I mean.

788
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,680
About half past ten.

789
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,320
-Exactly.
- Right.

790
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,960
That's not true
because my husband was there.

791
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,680
That's correct.

792
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,840
- Remember, the official story--
-My husband fudged everything off.

793
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,000
I cannot tell you why because
he's no longer with us, as you know.

794
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,960
- He didn't tell you why--
-Don't forget, that was his business.

795
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,600
To keep the press at bay.
He kept everyone in abeyance.

796
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,680
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

797
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,280
Did you go into the house?

798
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,120
- Yeah.
- Did you see Monroe's body?

799
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,360
Yeah, she was on the bed.

800
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,800
Do you recall whether she was
on her back or stomach?

801
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,800
Side.

802
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,720
- She was on her side.
- Yes.

803
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:11,920
Yeah?

804
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,840
- Yeah.
- Do you know where it took her?

805
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,000
Took her to Santa Monica emergency.

806
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,360
No, she wasn't.

807
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,920
Yes, that's right.

808
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:41,720
Yeah.

809
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,360
-comatose, to the hospital…
- Right.

810
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,160
It's the truth.

811
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,080
- The other people involved.
- Involved.

812
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,880
I don't know who was involved.

813
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,960
Greenson and I were both at a… at a lunch.

814
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,040
I was sitting next to him at the table.

815
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,360
- Yes.
- And…

816
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,160
This is after she died.
'64, somewhere like that.

817
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,960
Quite closely related to her death.

818
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,120
They took her to St. John's.

819
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,320
And that she died in the ambulance.

820
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,280
Then they took her back to the house.
That was what he told me.

821
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,280
Right…

822
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,160
Yeah, he did!
He told me that he was in the ambulance.

823
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,280
Yeah, I just don't feel comfortable
telling you what he told me.

824
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,160
This sort of thing was not talked about.

825
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,920
-People of that magnitude.
- Yeah.

826
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,320
Also, he wouldn't want to burden me with

827
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,320
a knowledge
that I would then have to hide.

828
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,840
Hello?

829
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:47,880
Yes, Tony.

830
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,640
I don't want to go through it
with Marilyn again because, uh…

831
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:12,160
Listen, I don't know really anything
else that I feel that I ought to do.

832
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,520
-Tony!
- Yeah?

833
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:18,280
This has not had any interest
for me in a long time.

834
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,840
I went in, did my number, took my money
and got out of the business!

835
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:27,120
Find out where
Bobby Kennedy was that weekend.

836
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,920
Do you wanna ask me something or--

837
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,680
Yeah, I had heard,

838
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,920
on good authority,
that the Saturday that this happened,

839
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,400
Bobby had come into town.

840
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,920
Bobby was in town and supposedly left.

841
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,600
And when I say I heard it,
I heard it from a federal agent.

842
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,880
Yes.
It was definitely from the FBI.

843
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,280
I think he was at Peter's house
at the beach.

844
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,440
Yeah, that's what I…

845
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,040
In fact, I…
I must say, yes, I… I do remember that.

846
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,440
-He was.
- Right.

847
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,760
-He was at Peter's house at the beach.
- Right.

848
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,680
Well, I hope your phone is clean.

849
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,680
- Which is a good question.
- Yes.

850
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:26,680
Did Freddy, uh, corroborate?
And if you don't wanna tell me, okay.

851
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,520
But I can call Fred. He'll tell me.

852
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,600
Well, you're talking to a lot of people,
and, you know,

853
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,560
you're obviously really intent
on getting into this thing.

854
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,080
That Marilyn was murdered is baloney.

855
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,800
- I'll put you straight on it.
- Yeah.

856
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,000
First of all,
what did Freddy tell you?

857
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,120
There were tapes
recorded the day of her death.

858
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:20,600
Bobby Kennedy called her the night
of her death from Lawford's house.

859
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:25,120
And she said, you know, "Don't bother me.
Leave me alone. Stay out of my life."

860
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,320
A very violent argument, that, you know,
"I feel passed around, I feel used,

861
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,760
I feel like a piece of meat."

862
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,240
Now, that's true.

863
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,360
-What you just said is true.
- Right.

864
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,440
She was raising a stink,

865
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,880
calling the broth…
Calling John and the White House

866
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,040
and complaining about the situation.

867
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,320
- Because of the brother.
- Yes. The picture that I remember

868
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:57,960
is that she'd been hot and heavy
for… for Bob.

869
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,600
- Yes.
- At first.

870
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,600
And then, she'd gotten the cold shoulder,
or somehow or other, it had turned.

871
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,240
-Now the details of that, I don't know.
- Right.

872
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,440
But she had come
to the point where she felt like

873
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,480
-she was just being used.
- Yes.

874
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,880
And that's where it was at
about the time the end came.

875
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,800
- Right.
- She was upset and heartbro…

876
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,800
I don't know whether--
I don't think she was heartbroken.

877
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,480
I don't think that it was
a thing of being heartbroken.

878
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:30,760
It was a thing of feeling
taken advantage of and feeling

879
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,200
a lot of lies
and feeling that she was just being…

880
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:38,040
Had come to where she said,
you know, "I don't even want to see you."

881
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,840
You know, and, "Why did you come here?"

882
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,600
You know, "If you want to see me,
you come to see me."

883
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,680
-You know, "I'm not coming down there."
- Right.

884
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,360
The call to the White House thing,

885
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:52,960
I understood it to mean that,
like she was calling to say, you know,

886
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,680
"Get your brother away from me.
I hate all of you."

887
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,320
-That type of thing.
- Right.

888
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,680
There was a turning point
in her feelings.

889
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,480
Like a piece of meat, used, passed around.

890
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:15,880
I don't think she was heartbroken.

891
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,480
Feeling used.

892
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,800
- "I hate all of you."
-

893
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,080
I appreciate
very much your calling.

894
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,400
I think about you once in a while.

895
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,800
The Kennedys were
a very important part of Marilyn's life.

896
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:57,120
I wasn't included in this information,
but I was a witness to what was happening.

897
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:01,840
Yes.

898
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,440
And it became so sticky

899
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,720
that the protectors
of Robert Kennedy, you know,

900
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,600
had to step in there and protect him.

901
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:21,040
Not an investigation,
but rather a "hush-hush."

902
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:27,280
Because the man that
really was involved was the boss.

903
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,680
He was the attorney general,
so he could have the FBI do anything.

904
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,640
People that knew,

905
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:34,920
they knew that they didn't want
Bobby Kennedy's name brought into this,

906
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,960
again, because his brother was president.

907
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,800
They had done everything to hush this up.

908
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:57,560
We sort of started
to piece together what happened.

909
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:02,200
Press accounts were coming out,
and they didn't make a lot of sense to us.

910
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,720
And so we started playing detective.

911
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,880
I pieced together the notion
that a helicopter was used

912
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:10,920
and went out to see the helicopter pilot.

913
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,480
And I said, "Can I look at your log?
Have you got a log?"

914
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,400
And he said, "Sure!"

915
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,480
And he produced his log,
and I started thumbing through it.

916
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,240
And I saw an entry that said

917
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:25,800
that he took Kennedy to meet
a flight en route to San Francisco.

918
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,960
Two or three in the morning.

919
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

920
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,520
Well, also a call was made
to Bobby Kennedy's people.

921
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:53,320
That's right, and that he had been at the
beach house and that he had flown out.

922
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,200
That that was one reason for the delay.

923
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,360
The message we got back was that Kennedy

924
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,080
would appreciate it
if we didn't do the story.

925
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,760
We decided that we would
not go with the story.

926
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,960
Uh…
What did Freddy tell you about that?

927
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,080
But I mean, the only people
that would know about that

928
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,120
would be the people at the meeting.

929
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,920
Lawford showed up completely disorientated

930
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,360
and in a state of shock,
saying that Marilyn Monroe was dead,

931
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,440
that Bobby Kennedy was there,

932
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,800
that they had gotten in a big fight,

933
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,000
that he was spirited
out of town back up north,

934
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,760
and that he'd like
to have me make arrangements

935
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,160
to have someone go out to the house

936
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,400
and pick up any and all information

937
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,840
that was possible regarding
any involvement

938
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,200
between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys.

939
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,480
He was convinced there
was diaries around and maybe a note.

940
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,240
- One moment, please.
-Doyle.

941
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,080
- Yes.
- This had occurred?

942
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,840
- Oh yeah. It did happen.
- Right.

943
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,560
I was there at the time
when she died.

944
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,720
There were some people there that
normally wouldn't have been there.

945
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,280
- Bureau people?
- Yes.

946
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:27,480
Immediately. Before anybody
even realized what had happened.

947
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:33,800
It had to be instructions from
someone high up, higher than Hoover.

948
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,320
- The general or the president.
- Yes.

949
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,320
The only two.

950
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,400
She was raising a stink.

951
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,040
She was…

952
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,320
She…

953
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,680
Well, as far as the Los Angeles
District Attorney is concerned,

954
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,680
she killed herself,
either on purpose or accidentally.

955
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,800
The Marilyn Monroe case is closed.

956
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:06,880
The true things
rarely get into circulation.

957
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,000
It's usually the false things.

958
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:16,840
It's hard to know where to start
if you don't start with the truth.

959
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,160
I checked the operator for…

960
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,240
-Out of order.
- Hmm.

961
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:47,440
The operator said
the phone's off the hook.

962
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,560
She was dead…

963
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,960
I've had to live with it…

964
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,440
I should have got in my car
and gone up there.

965
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,640
I should have known better.

966
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:18,840
When I was a kid,

967
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,160
sitting in the front row…

968
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,840
at the movies on Saturday afternoon…

969
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,680
and I'd think how wonderful
it would be to be an actress.

970
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,280
Everything that I would see.

971
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,240
And…

972
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,440
I…

973
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,800
I wanted to know.

974
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,080
I would like to be a good actress.
