00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>This is car 2118.
Call Greenpoint Hospital.</i>

2
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,260
<i>We're bringing in a wounded cop.</i>

3
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,180
<i>All right, 10-4.</i>

4
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,360
8th Precinct.

5
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,010
Jesus Christ.

6
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,750
Guess who got shot.

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
Serpico.

8
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,260
You think a cop did it?

9
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,460
I know six cops
said they'd like to.

10
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Hello.

11
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,410
<i>New York Times.
Serpico's been shot.</i>

12
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,310
Oh, my God!

13
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,480
<i>- They're taking him to Greenpoint.
- I'll see you there.</i>

14
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,410
<i>To be a police officer
means to believe in the law...</i>

15
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,950
<i>and to enforce it impartially...</i>

16
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,110
respecting the equality
of all men...

17
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,280
and the dignity and worth
of every individual.

18
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,120
Every day, your life
will be on the line...

19
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,530
and also your character.

20
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,190
You'll need integrity,
courage, honesty...

21
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,330
compassion, courtesy...

22
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,170
and perseverance...

23
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,370
and patience.

24
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,970
You men are now prepared
to join the war against crime...

25
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,850
and put the theory you have learned
into practice in the streets.

26
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,390
Same time, same place...
both reports.

27
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,330
I already made out a 424.

28
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,930
- You covering this, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Chief Green.

29
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,030
Who was with Serpico?

30
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,470
- Heinemann and Julio.
- I want them interrogated.

31
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,270
I want this conducted as an official
departmental investigation.

32
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,680
Transcripts by 9:00 a.m.

33
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,820
Another thing...
I want a 24-hour guard on Serpico.

34
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,160
- Yes, sir.
- You two, over there.

35
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,290
<i>Anthony Sardo.</i>

36
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,830
<i>Ralph Seidler.</i>

37
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,430
Frank Serpico.

38
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,080
Come on.
Marianne wants a good shot.

39
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,720
Get closer!

40
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,120
Patrolman Serpico.

41
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,850
Upstairs.
See the roll-call man.

42
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,900
Memorize your posts and sectors.
This week you're 8:00 to 4:00.

43
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,370
Next week, 4:00 to midnight.
Grab a locker.

44
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,570
Any questions, older guys will
fill you in. Good luck.

45
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,570
Yo! 8:00.
Let's go! Come on!

46
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,160
Gather around. Let's go.

47
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,230
All right. Settle down.

48
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,870
All right. Just a few announcements
today and two new men.

49
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,640
On the board on my left,
you see squad one, blue sector...

50
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,910
squad two, red sector...

51
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,920
squad three, green sector.

52
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,290
Now, we want summonses,
summonses, summonses.

53
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,120
I'll help the boys, Florence.

54
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,460
- This is Frank Serpico, Charlie.
- Hello, Frank.

55
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,720
- Hello, Charlie.
- How about some creamed chicken?

56
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,670
- Sounds good to me.
- No, I think I'll have...

57
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,600
How about a roast beef on roll?

58
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,770
Yeah, okay. You go through
the line. I'll bring it over.

59
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,820
Peluce, it's all fat here.

60
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,080
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Take it easy.

61
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,590
Sit down, sit down.

62
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,220
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

63
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,160
Well, I'm not fussy.
I don't know how I'm gonna eat this.

64
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,720
Charlie's okay. We give him a break
on double parking on deliveries.

65
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,970
Couldn't I pay for it,
get what I want?

66
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,740
Frank, generally, you just sort of
take what Charlie gives you.

67
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,890
<i>Sector D-David, 1034,
possible rape in progress...</i>

68
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,360
<i>vicinity of PS 218,
Grand Avenue and BQ Expressway.</i>

69
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,100
Becker, aren't
we gonna take that?

70
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,760
Relax, Frank.
It's not our sector.

71
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,030
It's on the borderline.

72
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,810
I'm gonna take it.

73
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,540
D sector, 1547, 10-4.

74
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,780
Oh, my God!

75
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,950
Hold it! Hold it!
Police officers!

76
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,460
Oh, shit!

77
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,760
- Come on. Give us...
- Don't shoot now.

78
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,320
Be cool.

79
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,920
All right. Okay.
Put your guns away.

80
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,330
Put your guns away, man.
Come on. Goddamn it!

81
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,160
I said put them
motherfucking guns away!

82
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,330
I'll cut her, goddamn it.

83
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,640
Turn the motherfucking
light out, man.

84
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,240
I'll cut her, man.
I'll cut her.

85
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,480
Now, you just be cool,
goddamn it.

86
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,640
Just be cool. All right.

87
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,480
All right. All right.
That's it.

88
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,820
The other one took his thing out.

89
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,150
He put it up to my mouth.

90
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,350
He... He held me down.

91
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,160
They said if I didn't do it...

92
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,170
they'd kill me.

93
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,130
She's gonna make
a hell of a witness.

94
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,300
Would you like a stretcher?

95
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,220
Muscles, he's all yours.
I'll call you from the hospital.

96
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,270
Okay, hard-on.

97
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,540
Who were your playmates?

98
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,410
Hey, Frank,
you want a piece of this?

99
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,080
No. I'm gonna fill out
the arrest card.

100
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,300
Hey, Charlie, let me have
five minutes with him.

101
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,310
- Sure.
- Thanks.

102
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,190
Thank you, Charlie.

103
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,600
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?

104
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,290
How come you didn't
stay for the fun?

105
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,460
That's not my kind of fun.

106
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,810
Shit.

107
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,470
I want to talk to you.

108
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,070
I want to take you across the
street, get you a cup of coffee...

109
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,780
without cuffs.

110
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,980
Now, look. I didn't touch you
upstairs, right?

111
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,120
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back.

112
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,630
Understand?

113
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,330
Come on.

114
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,830
<i>It's a goddamn shame you gotta take
this whole rap yourself.</i>

115
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,170
I don't know. Maybe you're guilty,
maybe you're not.

116
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,680
Maybe you just
went along for the ride.

117
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,010
I got a feeling
you just went along.

118
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,550
But you're the one
who got caught.

119
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,960
You never even
got your cock out.

120
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,860
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.

121
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,500
Look at you.

122
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,270
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.

123
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,980
I don't understand you,
you know that?

124
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,140
What are you,
obligated to those guys?

125
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,180
Fuck it.
They left you holding the bag.

126
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,340
You don't owe them nothin'.

127
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,850
They're gonna put you away,
you know that?

128
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,860
What can I get?

129
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,730
Oh, let's see...
kidnapping...

130
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,930
sodomy, rape...

131
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,290
Are you kidding me?

132
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,650
You talk to me.
Save yourself.

133
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,480
Let it go, Harv!

134
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,100
Take the shot.

135
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,360
You not gonna send someone over?
Look, look.

136
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,730
McCoy, I get one,
I'm gonna lose the other.

137
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,970
Look, Serpico, that's Muscles' case.
He's off for a couple days.

138
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,940
<i>- I can't cut in, Frank.
- They're here now!</i>

139
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,940
<i>- It'll keep.
- No, it won't!</i>

140
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,500
Police officer!
Hold it! Hold it!

141
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,940
Turn around. Turn around.

142
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,110
- Ow!
- Spread!

143
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,140
Come on, man. Come on.
Please take that gun from my head.

144
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,150
Turn around slow.

145
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,700
We'll take it from here, kid.
You don't have to hang around.

146
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,640
What are you talking about?
That's my collar.

147
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,570
We take the collar.

148
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,950
A collar like this, don't look good,
a patrolman takes it.

149
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,350
Wait a minute.
I don't care how it looks.

150
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,480
Now, I did the work. I broke my ass
on this. It's my collar.

151
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,890
You really want the collar, kid?
You can be brought up on charges.

152
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,660
Left your post, the street, entered
the school yard without permission...

153
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,730
That's just for openers.
Right, Penella?

154
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,600
No memo entry. Shit. You'll be lucky
to end up with a reprimand.

155
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,270
We'll give you an assist
on the arrest, kid.

156
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,250
Come on, Frankie!

157
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,780
Jim, get out of the way!
What are you doing?

158
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,390
What you want me to do?
Go across the street?

159
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,770
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Uncle Will. How you doing?

160
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,110
- Hey, Pasquale.
- Hey, Frankie! How you doing?

161
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,320
Okay. How you doing?
Where's Pop?

162
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,360
Be back in a half hour.
How's it going, Frankie?

163
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,620
Okay.
I come to get my shoes.

164
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,030
Rev it up. Rev it up!

165
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,990
- Here they are.
- Frankie, how you doing?

166
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay. Good job.

167
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,010
You people do good work here.

168
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,370
So, how you doing, Frankie?

169
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,710
You keep asking me that. What's
the matter with you? I'm doing okay!

170
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,740
Well, I thought you were coming over
to the house Saturday night.

171
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,910
I'm sorry, Pasquale.
I couldn't make it.

172
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,650
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed...

173
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,630
Now, look. I don't like that.
I mean, really.

174
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,390
Don't invite people over
if you're not sure I'm gonna come.

175
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,230
I mean it, now. If I want to
see Marianne, I'll call her.

176
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,530
What's going on
with you two anyway?

177
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,940
Hey, Pasquale,
I'm gonna tell you something.

178
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,510
See, all day long,
I work with cops. Right?

179
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,140
Now, when I go out,
I see Marianne...

180
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,310
her father's a cop, her brother's
a cop, her uncle's a cop.

181
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,410
- I got a feeling she's a cop too.
- Come here!

182
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,890
- How you doing on the job?
- It's got its problems.

183
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,330
Mama tells me that you're looking
for a new apartment. Is that true?

184
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,700
- Yeah.
- So, where are you going?

185
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,370
I don't know.
I'm looking around by school.

186
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,370
NYU? Greenwich Village?

187
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,600
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.
- What's the matter?

188
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,870
The old neighborhood's
not good enough for ya?

189
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,740
Tell Pop I was here.

190
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,680
Frankie, Sunday?

191
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,270
Sunday what?

192
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,480
Dinner? Huh?

193
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,790
- Do me one favor... no Marianne.
- I know. No Marianne.

194
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,950
All right.
A couple of announcements.

195
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,290
"Announcing a course in
fingerprint identification...

196
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,460
to be given at John Jay College.

197
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,620
This course will be available
to those patrolmen...

198
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,790
who wish to make themselves
eligible for assignment...

199
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,070
to the Bureau of
Criminal Identification, BCI...

200
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,540
which is generally considered to be
a path to a detective's gold shield.

201
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,440
Signed, Captain McGuire."

202
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,710
On the board on my left,
you see squad one...

203
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,850
Hot enough for ya?

204
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,650
It's not the heat.
It's the humidity.

205
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,990
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

206
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,010
You know how long
you're taking on that one?

207
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,450
Check one print category, two...
That's plenty.

208
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,150
I'm not gonna give a guy a
"no record" when he might have one.

209
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,290
How long you been
with the BCI now, Serpico?

210
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,920
All my life.

211
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,230
That's long enough to know
how we do things.

212
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,740
Barto, it's not just that.

213
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,570
You don't like me.

214
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,200
BCI never had
a weirdo cop before.

215
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,640
Barto, stop buggin' me.

216
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,480
Mama?

217
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,520
Hey.

218
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,130
Wanna buy a puppy?

219
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,340
Look at that, huh?

220
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,900
Where'd you get these dogs?

221
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,080
Oh, they're mine.

222
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,280
Want one for free?

223
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,840
- I'll pay for it. How much?
- Five dollars.

224
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,520
You got it.

225
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,160
Okay, now which one
of you guys wanna come with me?

226
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,670
What?

227
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,970
Come on.

228
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,870
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

229
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,970
Just watch the car and my stuff
over here, 'cause I'm movin' in.

230
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,980
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

231
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,500
Don Quixote.

232
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Señorita Land?

233
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,000
Mr. Serpico.

234
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,940
I got my horse here.
Maybe I could drop you someplace.

235
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,670
Well, I'm going to work
at the Café Reggio.

236
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,680
Café Reggio.

237
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,450
- That's 4th Street and...
- MacDougal and 3rd.

238
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,710
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yeah. Sure.

239
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,680
Jesus, what's that?

240
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,160
You got your hands on
my money belt. Don't do that.

241
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,630
That's not a money belt.
That's a gun.

242
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,930
- Well, we gotta eat, don't we?
- Oh, come on!

243
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,300
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?

244
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,300
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm their lion tamer.

245
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,270
- Come on.
- That's the truth.

246
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,830
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?

247
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,340
- What do you do?
- Me?

248
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,680
I'm an actress, a singer,
a dancer and a Buddhist.

249
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,620
In that order?

250
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,060
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.

251
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,250
Those leaps that guy made,
what do you call 'em again?

252
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,910
Jetés.

253
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,220
You try it.

254
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,350
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?

255
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,590
Next life. Come on.

256
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,130
What are you reading now,
Serpico?

257
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,810
<i>My Life by Isadora Duncan.</i>

258
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,310
She was a ballet dancer.

259
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,680
A belly dancer?

260
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,260
No. No, a ballet dancer.
Ballet.

261
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,490
- You know ballet?
- A little.

262
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,290
- A little bit? You ever see one?
- Not close.

263
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,230
I've been to the ballet.
It's terrific.

264
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,860
- I've been taking classes.
- Oh, yeah?

265
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,870
That's where I go
after I leave here.

266
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,970
Fantastic for your body.
Really builds you up.

267
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,480
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?

268
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,670
I noticed.

269
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,340
There's five positions.

270
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,580
Five pos...
You're being shortchanged.

271
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,450
- Oh, no. It's enough. Believe me.
- For what?

272
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,080
Watch. See?

273
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,750
This is the first position.

274
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,090
From this position,
I can do anything.

275
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,990
- You want to see?
- Sure.

276
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,000
Here we go.

277
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,930
Bye, Barto!

278
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,560
- Lieutenant Steiger...
- No, no. Later.

279
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,140
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Potts, I wanted to read.

280
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,290
Positions, positions!

281
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,410
Positions like that you don't see
in a pretzel factory.

282
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,550
Now I gotta do my pee-pee
in the dark.

283
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,750
She's gotta be a nympho
with positions like that.

284
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,820
Hey, Serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

285
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,890
Barto wants a specimen.

286
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,270
I'm gonna look into this matter.

287
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,670
- What do you got there?
- Here.

288
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,340
Straight ahead.

289
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,120
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

290
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,690
- I don't see anything over there.
- Let me see.

291
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,120
She just pulled down the shade.

292
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,250
- You gotta be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.

293
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,430
Hold it, Serpico.
What were you two doing?

294
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,330
- What?
- In the shithouse in the dark!

295
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,670
Were you goin' down on him?

296
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,380
- What are you talking about?
- You gonna tell me you were peeping?

297
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,380
You were sucking his cock,
weren't you?

298
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,890
- What are you, crazy?
- I'll show you fuckin' crazy!

299
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,580
Last week I found a pair of shorts
with semen on 'em!

300
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,360
There!

301
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,320
You actually accusing me of this?

302
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,670
Good morning, Captain McClain.
I'm Officer Serpico.

303
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,900
I was told I could
talk to you, sir.

304
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,510
Certainly, son.
Come in.

305
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,740
Lieutenant Steiger
won't make a report.

306
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,410
He's too concerned with
the image of his department.

307
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,790
But it... it could affect
your future in the BCI.

308
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,760
Sir, I tell you...

309
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,100
Frankly,
I don't see any future there.

310
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:10,370
It was bullshit about it being
a path toward being detective...

311
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,600
because I've been there
two years now...

312
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,610
And you want a transfer.

313
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,370
Yes, sir, but I don't wanna
go back to uniform.

314
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,150
I'll see what I can do, Frank.

315
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,950
Francis, do you know about my
weekend retreats for Catholic officers?

316
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,150
Well, you read that.
It might be of interest to you.

317
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,860
You are Catholic?

318
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,460
- Yeah. I was baptized, yes.
- Good, good.

319
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,660
Alfie, come on.

320
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,910
I missed you, baby.

321
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,580
She's so crazy, that girl,
I tell you.

322
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,340
Why Paco?

323
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,440
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favor?

324
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,850
- Get my keys out of this pocket.
- Sure.

325
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,790
Well, what'll I call you...

326
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,890
Frank or Paco?

327
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Sally! Larry!
This is Paco.

328
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,440
- Hey, man.
- Larry's a poet.

329
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,780
But he works for
an advertising agency.

330
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,410
Sally's an actress,
but works for a photographer.

331
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,790
Paco's a policeman.

332
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,920
That's terrific.

333
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,550
I work for the police department.

334
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,760
- That's really nice.
- Wow.

335
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,020
See ya.

336
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,990
- How are you?
- Pat's a novelist.

337
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,330
But you're working for an insurance
company now, aren't you?

338
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,970
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. Paco's a policeman.

339
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,100
Really? How exciting!

340
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,610
Well, not too.
Right now, I'm filing fingerprints.

341
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,310
Listen,
I file insurance policies.

342
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,420
We should get together then,
file or something.

343
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,480
- That was an improvement.
- I wanna ask you something.

344
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,990
How come all your friends are
on their way to being somebody else?

345
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,360
Think about that. I wanna
ask you something else too.

346
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,490
Will you do me a big favor?

347
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,590
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

348
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,600
You know, let me just sort of
do it myself.

349
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,610
Okay.

350
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,880
Hey, man,
are you really a cop?

351
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,680
- Right. I am.
- Wow.

352
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,850
You know,
Leslie is a mind fucker.

353
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,190
You gotta be kidding.
I didn't know that.

354
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,060
What's a mind fucker?

355
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,190
Well, that's a chick...

356
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,600
who digs intellectual types
and super-bright guys.

357
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,760
Oh, yeah?

358
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,100
Well, she's very perceptive.

359
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,410
You know, Japanese culture
and theater and painting...

360
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,450
it's too rigidly stylized.

361
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,040
Well, yeah, you know...
Yeah, but...

362
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,580
I think after a while,
when you get through that...

363
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,490
you start to appreciate the
clarity... you know, the authority.

364
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,190
I got a sheep dog.

365
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,330
There have been
sheep dogs in my family...

366
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,730
dating back...

367
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,530
for 16 generations...

368
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,540
- Dating back to the Borgias.
- Oh, shit!

369
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,310
The family crest...

370
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,710
is a sheep dog
pissing into a gondola.

371
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,220
Oh, shit!

372
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,190
Paco, everybody loves you!

373
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,590
I love you!

374
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,930
Hey, Lieutenant,
my wife call for me?

375
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,310
Give her this, will ya?

376
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.

377
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,210
That fucking thing on your lip,
it goes. And get a haircut.

378
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,180
- Sir...
- That's an order.

379
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,190
You look like an asshole
with dentures.

380
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,950
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure. Go see Captain Tolkin.

381
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,620
You got one foot in shit already.
Put the other one in.

382
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,960
Where might that be,
I wonder, sir?

383
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,260
Thank you, sir.

384
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,170
That is one hell of a mustache.
I wish I had the guts.

385
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,770
Well, I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

386
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,570
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I'd like to tell ya, sir.

387
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,670
I thought so.

388
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,310
I think it's time that we started
to communicate more on the streets.

389
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,190
You know, the way it is,
we're totally isolated, sir.

390
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,320
We're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

391
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,880
An undercover cop walks around
in disguise...

392
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,900
wearing black shoes
and white socks.

393
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,920
Everybody knows who he is.

394
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,230
You made your point.

395
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,640
I want you to keep your mustache.

396
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,240
And I'd like you to patrol
in your own car.

397
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:19,280
Wear whatever you want.
How does that strike you?

398
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,140
I'd like that, sir.

399
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,280
To be honest,
I'm bucking for detective.

400
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,780
No shit.

401
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,970
Hold it!

402
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,470
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,570
Oh, Christ!

404
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,910
Quick. Get against there.

405
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,390
Hey!

406
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,420
I'm a police officer!
Get over there!

407
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,010
Hey! It's me, Serpico!

408
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,720
Hey, I'm a police officer!
Police officer!

409
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
Poli... I'm an officer!
I'm a police officer!

410
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,290
Jesus, Frank, how was I
supposed to recognize you?

411
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,830
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!

412
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,870
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?

413
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,310
You fire without a warning,
without a fucking brain in your head?

414
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,220
Oh, shit.

415
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,920
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

416
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,030
Holy shit.

417
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,230
Look at that mess.

418
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,600
Filling out forms till next month.

419
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,440
Good.

420
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,640
Hey, Jesus, Frank...

421
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,980
I know it's a hell
of a time to ask you...

422
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,540
but I'm gonna have to go through
all that ballistics bullshit...

423
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,880
Good. You should.

424
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,680
It's gonna look like hell if I
don't have anything to show for it.

425
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,090
Frank, do me a favor.
Give us the collar.

426
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,730
You motherfucker.

427
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,160
You want the collar, huh? You
don't wanna fill out forms, right?

428
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,510
Here.

429
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,920
- You're a buddy.
- I'm a buddy.

430
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,960
Only you tell Tolkin
I gave it to you.

431
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,160
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample...

432
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,100
so that when you become
plainclothesmen...

433
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,040
you'll be able to identify
the pungent aroma...

434
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,630
and recognize the disorienting effect
of the drug...

435
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:42,480
when you observe them
in narcotics suspects.

436
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,810
Among users of the drug...

437
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,280
a marijuana cigarette...

438
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,520
is referred to as reefer...

439
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,990
stick, roach, joint.

440
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,960
The drug itself
is referred to as pot...

441
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,970
tea, boo...

442
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,130
stuff, grass.

443
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,290
Hey, this is real good shit.

444
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,830
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.

445
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,630
Look what it is.
It's a potato factory is what it is.

446
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,860
And I have to have some,
and I love you... I love it.

447
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,100
Have some of that. We have
nothing to... I have to have a dime?

448
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,070
The dime goes
in the little slot there.

449
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,200
That doesn't work.
It's from the Civil War, this machine.

450
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,110
- Pull on it.
- Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't...

451
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,480
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Shoot it out. Please!

452
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,880
I beg of you! Come out!
Potatoes, come out!

453
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,660
You're pretty fuckin' weird
for a cop.

454
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,090
Me? You!

455
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,460
- What about you, buddy? You!
- You're the weird guy. Me?

456
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,930
- You're a fuckin' hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.

457
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,490
The two of us.

458
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,500
Give me.

459
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,530
Where you supposed
to go from here?

460
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,200
93 Precinct, plainclothes.
Put your gun away.

461
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,140
You?

462
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,280
I am scheduled to go
on special assignment...

463
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,850
with the mayor's department
of investigations, detective squad.

464
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,020
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.

465
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,430
No four years in plainclothes?

466
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,200
Who do you know?

467
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,100
I make it my business to know
people... people who can help.

468
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,610
Unfair.

469
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,940
Unfair.

470
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,310
Life is unfair, pal.

471
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,840
I mean, look, you've got
a feel for the streets, and I...

472
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,440
- I've got a feel for the politics.
- Oh, yeah?

473
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,390
You and me in a Batmobile, we could
clean up the whole city in no time.

474
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,050
I wonder if we can get candy
out of this machine though.

475
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,020
No, thanks.

476
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,270
Well, this is a good place
to tell you, Paco.

477
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,070
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

478
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,180
- What about him?
- I'm gonna marry him in two months...

479
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,310
unless you marry me.

480
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,230
What about the theater
and your dancing?

481
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,360
A girl has to get
married sometime.

482
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,510
Well, you're a long way
from sometime, Leslie.

483
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,670
I thought you were committed.

484
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,010
I am, but...

485
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,020
You are, but?

486
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,210
I can go on working,
studying there.

487
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,920
Where? Fort Worth?

488
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,620
Amarillo.

489
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,340
Well, am I invited
to the wedding?

490
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,540
I'll ask Roy.

491
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,590
Yeah, it's pretty good
in this precinct.

492
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,590
Here you go.

493
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,560
Usually a 9:00 to 5:00 day is the
best time for policy and bookmaking.

494
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,020
If you have to work nights, like
a liquor violation, just call in.

495
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,460
Don't worry about
quotas right now.

496
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,660
Couple of hooker collars
will keep it cool.

497
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,870
Been holding this for you.

498
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,420
It's from Jewish Max.

499
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,870
First day on the precinct,
I get that.

500
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,580
This is great, Frank.

501
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,480
I can open up a whole can
of peas with this.

502
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,150
It's scary.

503
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,050
I wanna protect myself.

504
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,320
- You know what we do with this?
- What?

505
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,990
We take it to
Inspector Kellogg.

506
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,700
Kellogg... Didn't he used
to be in plainclothes?

507
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,330
He's the second-highest ranking cop
in the department of investigations.

508
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,710
- So what?
- What do you mean, "so what?"

509
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,040
I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

510
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,210
He owes me.
You understand?

511
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,720
He's the most honest cop
I know, Frank.

512
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,350
Frank, trust me.

513
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,870
Things like this were common
practice in the bad old days.

514
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,210
Hard to believe
it's still going on.

515
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,580
Serpico, don't you think
it's kind of stupid...

516
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,480
taking an envelope from somebody
you didn't know?

517
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,750
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, give me...

518
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:21,990
How would I know what was in it
unless I took it?

519
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,590
You have two alternatives.

520
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,030
You can force me to take you to
the commissioner of investigations.

521
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,370
He'll drag you in front
of a grand jury.

522
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,900
- I don't want that.
- I can understand that.

523
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,910
Word will get out.

524
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,910
Before it's all over, they'll find
you face-down in the East River.

525
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,960
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.

526
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:53,290
Well, what do I do with this?

527
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,680
Hey, Sarge?
You got a minute?

528
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:24,160
Colored cop gave me this.
I didn't know what to do with it.

529
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:33,300
Well, I'll send it on
to the Benevolent Association.

530
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,020
Alfie, come on.

531
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,670
Is that Bjoerling?

532
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,050
No. It's DiStefano.

533
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,840
I was sure it was Bjoerling.

534
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,620
You could hear it
better over here.

535
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,690
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.

536
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,300
For coffee.

537
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:44,070
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

538
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,270
Why don't you call in sick?
Perfect place.

539
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,270
Not me.

540
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,610
What are you,
dedicated or somethin'?

541
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,380
That's right, I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.

542
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,750
- Well, what do they know?
- I like your garden.

543
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,300
Love my garden.

544
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,330
Okay. I love your garden.

545
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,740
You know what they say,
don't you?

546
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,630
No. What do they say?

547
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,800
If you love a man's garden,
you gotta love the man.

548
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,190
You like her, Alfie?

549
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,380
All I can tell you, sir,
is I gave it back.

550
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,860
I gotta get out of the 93.

551
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:41,260
Well, what happened on
your narcotics application?

552
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:45,290
Looked like it was set, until
I told 'em I was in plainclothes.

553
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,170
It was like
the kiss of death.

554
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,500
They think everybody in clothes
is on the take.

555
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,240
Sir, do you know anything about
the Bronx 7th Division?

556
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:57,270
I can go there if I want,
but if it's the same shit, screw it.

557
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,840
I'd rather answer phones for Spanish
communications unit and go nuts.

558
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,510
Come on, Alfie.

559
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,210
Frank, did anyone
ever tell you...

560
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,880
that you have a tendency
toward self-pity?

561
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,990
No, you're the first.

562
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,590
All right. Frank, I have
a friend up there, Roy Palmer.

563
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,800
He's an administrative officer.
I'll speak with him.

564
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:24,170
- Good. Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye, Frank.

565
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,400
- God bless you.
- Right.

566
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,050
<i>Frank, Captain McClain here.</i>

567
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,210
Captain McClain. Could you
hold on a minute please, sir?

568
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,720
<i>Sure.</i>

569
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,700
Yeah. Sorry.

570
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,700
I saw Inspector Palmer tonight...

571
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:56,300
and he assures me the 7th Division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

572
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,770
His words, Frank.
"Clean as a hound's tooth."

573
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:02,580
<i>I told him he was getting
a hardworking officer...</i>

574
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,580
wears a beard, speaks Spanish and
would make a superb undercover man.

575
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,910
He was delighted.

576
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,980
That's good news, sir.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

577
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,080
<i>Good-bye, Frank.
God bless.</i>

578
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,290
When did you start doing that?

579
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,400
McClain says that Palmer says...

580
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,870
that the 7th is as clean
as a hound's tooth.

581
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,100
Well, if that's true,
your problems are over.

582
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,250
Plainclothes division.

583
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,520
Upstairs.

584
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,120
- How are you? Good to see you!
- All right.

585
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,260
We heard you were
coming up here. Listen.

586
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,460
Say hello to Nate Smith.
Frank Serpico.

587
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,370
- Jamie Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico?

588
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,810
Hey, babe, you're gonna
love it up here. It's beautiful.

589
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,930
Listen, take...
I'll see youse later, all right?

590
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,380
Take a little ride with me.
Get the feel of the division.

591
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,470
- Maybe I should check in first.
- Fuck that. Come on.

592
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:17,720
<i>Deck the halls
with boughs of holly</i>

593
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:25,990
Ten grand, Dallas...
if Minnesota. Right.

594
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,760
Green Bay, 12 and a half at...

595
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,760
You dumb fuck.
We told you this location's hot.

596
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,860
We told you to stay the fuck
out of here.

597
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,700
Keough, nobody told me.
Honest.

598
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,830
Bullshit.

599
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:40,670
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

600
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,010
Hi, kid.
All right, a C-note apiece.

601
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,140
No way. We got a complaint.
Right, Frank? Come on.

602
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,410
All right.
Make it 200, Keough.

603
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:52,320
Hey, what, are you getting cheap
in your old age, bambino?

604
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:55,020
- Three.
- Three?

605
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,750
You heard me.

606
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,020
- All right, three.
- I'll make it a light one.

607
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,960
- You wanna write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.

608
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,970
Take the collar, Frank.
Get on the sheet.

609
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,470
I better check in.

610
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,740
We're gonna have
a little talk later, right?

611
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,310
That dumb schmuck only came up with
two bills because I booked him?

612
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,680
Here you go, Frank.

613
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,350
It was your collar.
Keep it.

614
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,320
I had a hunch
you weren't gonna take it.

615
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,870
You know, Frankie, we got a call
about you from downtown.

616
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,560
Now, I ain't sayin' who.

617
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,300
They just said you couldn't
be trusted, you know?

618
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,170
- Because I don't take money, right?
- Come on, Frank.

619
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,730
Let's face it. Who can trust
a cop who don't take money?

620
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,310
I mean, you are pretty weird,
you know, kid?

621
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,150
And with that call, the guys
were gettin' a little worried.

622
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,020
I told them you were okay.
I knew you from the old 21.

623
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:02,420
You'd never hurt
another cop, right?

624
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:06,420
You'd never hurt another cop,
would you, Frank?

625
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,290
- That'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frankie.

626
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,870
We're not doing
anything bad here.

627
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,600
We're skimming
a little gambling money.

628
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,700
It's clean. It's not dope.
It hurts nobody.

629
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,710
Come on, Frank.

630
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,080
Gamblers are gentlemen, and
they're gonna operate anyhow, right?

631
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,680
Look, Keough, you don't have to
explain yourself to me.

632
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,880
Do what you got to do.
Want some tea?

633
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,930
No, I don't like that shit.
I'll have a coffee, huh?

634
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,620
What's the matter, Frank?
What are you worried about?

635
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,030
Listen.
We don't go overboard here.

636
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,090
We're not sloppy.
We're careful.

637
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,470
The spicks, niggers, we bust them.
They operate so dumb and sloppy...

638
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,630
they get your ass
in hot water every time.

639
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,230
But the Italians, now,
that's a different story.

640
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,540
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.

641
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:59,910
- You really got it analyzed.
- Fuckin' right I got it analyzed.

642
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,680
It's worth it.

643
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,240
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

644
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,380
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.

645
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,860
That's 800 clams every time your
girlfriend gets the curse tax free.

646
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,730
Here's the beauty. You don't
get it for the first eight weeks...

647
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,530
till the guys get to
know you and you're okay.

648
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,230
But you don't lose, either, 'cause
you get it on the other end...

649
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,040
when you leave the division.

650
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:31,140
Frankie, it's like...
it's like severance pay.

651
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,880
Think it over, all right?
In or out.

652
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:40,450
Look at me. I'm shaking.

653
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,890
All my life I wanted
to be a cop, you know?

654
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,330
It's like I can remember
nothing else.

655
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,000
I remember this one time...

656
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,340
there was...

657
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,930
Somethin' happened.
A domestic argument or somethin'.

658
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,950
Somebody stabbed somebody.

659
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,380
And...

660
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,010
there was this crowd
around this tenement.

661
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:13,450
I must have been nine,
ten years old. I was this big.

662
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,460
I went over to see
what was going on.

663
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:18,720
I noticed the red light
goin' around and around...

664
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,230
all these people,
and I couldn't see.

665
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,790
I kept saying, "Do you know
what's goin' on? Do you know?"

666
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,030
Nobody knew.

667
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:31,300
It was like a big mystery
behind that...

668
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,000
that crowd there.

669
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,510
All of a sudden...

670
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,640
the crowd just parted...

671
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,080
like the Red Sea, you see?

672
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,710
And there were these guys
in blue, and I said...

673
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,620
"They know."

674
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:50,660
What do they know?
What do they know?

675
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,130
It's amazing.

676
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,170
It's incredible...

677
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,210
but I feel like a criminal
'cause I don't take money.

678
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,800
You get so tense
when you talk about it.

679
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,310
I wonder why.

680
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,970
Come here.

681
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,020
- Right there.
- Here?

682
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,090
I'm gonna ask you
a question, okay?

683
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,460
Do you like cops?

684
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,470
You're my first.

685
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,540
No, I mean all this shit I've been
telling you. Do you believe it?

686
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,200
Why not?

687
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:40,170
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.

688
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,870
What's the matter with me?

689
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:46,040
Everybody knows about cops.

690
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,750
Did you ever hear the story
of the wise king?

691
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,980
Nope, but I got the feeling
I'm gonna hear it.

692
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:58,490
Well, there was this king,
and he ruled over his kingdom.

693
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,960
Right in the middle of the kingdom
there was a well.

694
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,020
That's where everybody drank.

695
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,730
One night,
this witch came along...

696
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,740
and she poisoned the well.

697
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,970
And the next day, everybody drank
from it except the king...

698
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,100
and they all went crazy.

699
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,480
They got together
in the street and they said...

700
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,520
"We got to get rid of the king,
'cause the king is mad."

701
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:27,090
And then that night, he went down
and he drank from the well.

702
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,960
And the next day
all the people rejoiced...

703
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:34,120
because their king
had regained his reason.

704
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,800
I think you're trying
to tell me somethin'.

705
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,700
- Me?
- Yeah.

706
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,210
Hey, Frank, I want you
to say hello to somebody.

707
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,210
- Drop your cocks and grab your socks!
- What the fuck is this?

708
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,680
Frank Serpico,
say hello to Don Rubello.

709
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,840
- He's gonna be your new partner.
- How you doin'?

710
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,320
If you don't want to work with this
fucking nut for some reason, man...

711
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:05,360
I'll buddy up with him,
all right?

712
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:07,730
And go through all that crap
changing assignments?

713
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,890
No. We'll be okay.

714
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,800
<i>We're paisans, huh?</i>

715
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,870
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- It's my partner.

716
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,700
- Partner?
- He's specially trained, you know?

717
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,900
He goes to track down heroin.

718
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,680
Let him loose, goes into the hole,
picks it up, brings it back...

719
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,180
sniffs it out,
brings it to you.

720
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,650
- Yeah. I heard of that.
- You heard of that?

721
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,650
This guy I'm looking for,
Vernon...

722
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:42,790
He's a numbers collector who ain't
been meeting his obligations.

723
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,790
He won't be hard to spot.
He's a mover. This is prime time.

724
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:55,040
Since we're partners,
you gotta know the situation.

725
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:59,170
Straight off.
I collect for the division...

726
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,340
me and two other bagmen.

727
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,850
That's what Keough
was sort of hinting at.

728
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:08,820
Three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

729
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,120
Hey!
Look, there he is.

730
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:27,070
Son of a bitch!

731
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,380
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!

732
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,890
Where's the money?

733
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,650
You been jerking me around,
you fuck! Huh?

734
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,990
Ain't no money!
I'm behind now, man!

735
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,100
Three times you never show,
right?

736
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:12,400
I'll have it for you tonight,
I swear.

737
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,410
Don't bust me!

738
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,940
Last time, Vernon.
The last time.

739
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:23,180
You fuck me and you're gone,
you hear? You hear? Huh?

740
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,680
See you at the Domino,
midnight.

741
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,820
And you'd better have $300, ya fuck.
You hear? Right? Right?

742
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,800
All right, Frank.

743
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,440
I keep this place
for socializing.

744
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,940
Someday we'll get a couple of
broads, huh? Have a little party.

745
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,450
Hey!

746
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,280
Make some ice.
Booze is right over here.

747
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,490
So what do you think, Frank?
About the money?

748
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,490
Look, Don...

749
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,970
if I was broke, if I had a family...
I don't know.

750
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,970
But I'm not broke,
and I don't have a family.

751
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,370
So why the fuck stick my neck out?
You know what I mean?

752
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,500
It's already out, Frank...
not taking the money.

753
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,740
It's better the other guys
don't know that.

754
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,750
Hey, I tell you what I'll do.

755
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,980
I'll hold your share
for you, huh?

756
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,990
You change your mind,
it'll be right in here.

757
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,450
Right in here,
right down to the penny, huh?

758
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,580
Hey. Look at that.

759
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:37,060
- What are you drinking?
- Give me a scotch.

760
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:43,370
Next thing I wanna do, I wanna
get a color TV for the games.

761
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:46,840
Hey, how about some gin?
Penny a point. Huh?

762
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,850
Yeah.
Let me ask him first.

763
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,630
Hello, Frank.
Get in.

764
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,300
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.

765
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,640
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.

766
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,740
No, absolutely not.

767
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,750
All right, all right.

768
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:41,250
I notified Commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

769
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,350
He wants you to stay where you are
and continue to collect information.

770
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:48,160
Then you'll be
his eyes and his ears.

771
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:50,560
He said he was delighted
that, quote...

772
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:54,000
"A man of integrity
had surfaced," unquote.

773
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,740
When do I hear from him?

774
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,970
He said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

775
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:04,850
Reach out?

776
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:09,650
See, you know, my situation's
pretty fuckin' sticky up there.

777
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,950
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait for him...

778
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:14,650
- You must have patience, Frank.
- But it's pretty fucking sticky.

779
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,280
Patience and faith.

780
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,690
When a man like the commissioner
says he'll get in touch with you...

781
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,700
he'll get in touch with you.

782
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,130
Good-bye, son.
God bless you.

783
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:42,780
All right, now.
Marinda's too hot.

784
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,450
We got to lay off him
for a couple of months.

785
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,120
And listen, Falco's got two runners
he ain't paying for.

786
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:51,130
Check that fucking guy out, huh?
Hey, Frankie, how are you?

787
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,220
- How are you?
- Rubello's being transferred...

788
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,160
so you're gonna have to work
with a new bagman.

789
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:59,790
Al Sarno, I want you to meet Frank
Serpico. This'll be your new man.

790
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,460
- How are you?
- Fine.

791
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,560
Listen, you know that operation
down by Hunt's Point, the new one?

792
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,730
What are we gonna do about that?
Who are we givin' to?

793
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:09,370
You the new bagman,
you prick?

794
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:13,810
What happened to Rubello, you son
of a bitch? You narco cop fucker!

795
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,820
Wait a minute.

796
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:30,490
You know, Frank,
sometimes I ask myself...

797
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,760
what the fuck am I doing?

798
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:37,430
You know,
if this ever came out...

799
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,440
Christ, my family.

800
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,440
My daughter.

801
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,210
She just started
with the San Francisco Opera.

802
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,650
Chorus.

803
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,780
Took a lot of money.

804
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,820
I once tried to pull out.

805
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:57,050
Christ, they were all over me.

806
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:59,190
So you...

807
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,200
just go along.

808
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,560
Unless you're willing
to go back to uniform duty.

809
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,820
Shit.
How the money rolls in.

810
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,620
- Here. Let me give you yours now.
- I'm not on.

811
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,930
- What do you mean, you're not on?
- Just what I said.

812
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,590
I'm not on.
I don't take money.

813
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:41,160
- Some gag. Here.
- No, I told you straight.

814
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:44,770
I don't take money,
and that's the truth.

815
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,810
- What were you doing with Rubello?
- Ask Rubello.

816
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,010
Your nut...
where's it been going?

817
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:57,610
Ask Rubello.

818
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,350
<i>All right, then, sir.
I'll go to Delaney myself then.</i>

819
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:06,020
- That would not be advisable.
- You don't understand, Captain.

820
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,760
<i>- It's been weeks. Not a word.
- I understand perfectly.</i>

821
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:12,320
No, but, Captain,
now they know I'm not on.

822
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,670
I've done all I can do.
Good-bye, Frank.

823
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:23,240
He's out.
Won't do another fucking thing.

824
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,480
Blair, I'm telling you, nothing's
gonna happen from the inside.

825
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,880
The top guys have been
cops too long.

826
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,860
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?

827
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,580
No, not a fucking word.

828
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:44,400
Would you be willing to go
outside the department?

829
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,200
Where could we go?

830
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,700
Would you believe
the mayor's office?

831
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:01,380
- The mayor's office?
- His right-hand man...

832
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:04,180
guy named Jerry Berman,
from Princeton.

833
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,950
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

834
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,050
And he cares, Frank.
He really cares.

835
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:15,790
- You know what we're doing?
- Yeah.

836
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,730
- We're going outside the department.
- That's right.

837
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:23,970
<i>Dynamite.</i>

838
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,170
Every plainclothesman
in the division...

839
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,580
and one,
maybe two lieutenants?

840
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:33,670
That is dynamite.
That is incredible.

841
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:36,950
That is 150...

842
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,080
That is $250,000 a year...

843
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,180
but that is just one precinct.

844
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,920
Oh, that is amazing!

845
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:50,560
See, what I feel is needed here
is, like, a real investigation.

846
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,760
And I am sure that the mayor
will see this immediately.

847
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,700
McClain and Delaney...

848
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:59,210
they have done nothing?

849
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,040
Oh, man.
That is amazing.

850
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,450
Another thing.
See, in a couple of days...

851
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,110
they're gonna have
a meeting of the pad.

852
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:10,450
Oh, right.

853
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,390
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that.

854
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:17,720
Rumors. See, I have heard rumors,
but never touching it directly.

855
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:23,250
And for an on-the-line cop to come
forward like this is beautiful.

856
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,560
Really, Frank, I mean...

857
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,500
you have my respect
and my sympathy...

858
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:30,510
for what you've been
going through, man.

859
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:32,340
Wow.

860
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:39,450
Hello.
This is Jerry Berman.

861
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,250
Is he there?
All right. I'll hold on.

862
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,740
Well?

863
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,530
Tell me what happened,
Paco.

864
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,540
I'd like a drink.

865
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,280
That guy is gonna
go to the mayor.

866
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:21,420
To the mayor!

867
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,330
Come here, Alfie. We're all
gonna go to the mayor together.

868
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,330
You know that?

869
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:33,800
I couldn't be
any more embarrassed.

870
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:37,570
It's like a personal defeat.

871
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,250
However...

872
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,250
there are priorities.

873
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,750
What are the priorities,
Jerry?

874
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,910
The priorities are...

875
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:50,420
a long, hot summer ahead...

876
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:53,220
and riots are expected...

877
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,490
and the mayor cannot
alienate the police force.

878
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:01,360
Now, in the fall...

879
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,300
Now, in the fall,
it may be possible...

880
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,310
to take another look
at the situation.

881
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:08,170
All right, fine.
I'm sorry.

882
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,990
They're all rotten.

883
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,150
Chickenshit.

884
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:28,290
The whole fucking
system's corrupt.

885
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,360
- Who's there?
- It's me. I gotta talk to ya.

886
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:42,940
You know, Frank, you're behaving
like a goddamn child. You hear?

887
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,940
Let him in.

888
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,610
You let him in.

889
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:10,030
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

890
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,200
Bullshit! I got me
into this whole thing.

891
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:16,910
"Wow. Amazing!

892
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,850
"Dynamite!
Beautiful! Dynamite!

893
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,850
Priorities. Priorities."

894
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,850
You and your big-deal friends,
your contacts...

895
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,220
your big bullshit names.

896
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:31,050
Bob Blair, the big operator
from Princeton.

897
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,090
The mystery man with the connections,
the hot line to the mayor.

898
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,320
Who the fuck do you think you are,
you son of a bitch?

899
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,160
You come looking for help,
whining, mealy-mouthed...

900
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:41,390
with your humble-pie act...
the saint, the injured innocent.

901
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,400
Who told you the department
or the whole world...

902
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:46,030
was some kind
of a fucking boy scout camp?

903
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:52,400
What do you expect, for Christ's
sake, a magician? A big daddy?

904
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,920
White knight snaps his fingers,
the dirty world turns white...

905
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:57,920
Just keep talking.
That's what you can do.

906
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:00,450
while the Pope's choir sings
"Ave Maria," is that it?

907
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,680
You gonna blame me 'cause those
bastards don't wanna get involved?

908
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,560
I tried to help you.
I got my head handed to me.

909
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:09,360
Where's your head? It's on
your shoulders. That's what I see.

910
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:12,690
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit over here?

911
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:14,960
Get ready to blow up again,
'cause I got another idea.

912
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,630
You and your ideas
are as full of shit as you are.

913
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,200
- Right on cue.
- Right on cue.

914
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,930
We can talk to Foreman,
the commissioner of investigations.

915
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:24,640
Another guy!
We got another guy here.

916
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,150
<i>We could even talk to a guy
I know on the New York Times.</i>

917
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,040
<i>Oh, that's terrific.
Go to the Times.</i>

918
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,350
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.

919
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,860
This is safe, Frank.

920
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,750
It's safe? With my ass on the line,
it's safe, right?

921
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:42,450
- Your ass is already on the line!
- That's my business!

922
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,590
- You don't trust me, Frank?
- I don't trust you!

923
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,220
- Go fuck yourself!
- Fuck you!

924
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,010
Look, when I come home,
I want a house clean.

925
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:56,600
- Don't take it out on me, Paco.
- I don't want to pick up shit!

926
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,510
Honey...

927
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:41,680
come to bed.

928
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,620
All right. Look, we all know
what this is about, right?

929
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:56,590
Frank, what the hell was happening
between you and Don Rubello?

930
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,470
Simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.

931
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:08,340
Rubello said if I changed my mind,
he'd hold my share...

932
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:10,970
he'd give it back to me.

933
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,600
- I didn't change my mind.
- The conniving bastard.

934
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,410
- All right. I'll handle Rubello.
- Donny was stealing.

935
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,210
I'll get back the money he took.
But this ain't gonna happen again.

936
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:25,020
From now on, no more three bagmen.
Starting today, every one of you...

937
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:29,820
makes his own collections...
no stops, no bread, okay?

938
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,830
- Right.
- You got it.

939
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:36,030
What about you, Frankie?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

940
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:40,730
- Why should I start now?
- Everybody'd feel better about you.

941
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,500
You can always give it
to charity.

942
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:47,110
Look, Frankie, what do you say,
a hundred a month just for expenses?

943
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:51,740
For my secretary and my
business lunches, entertainment?

944
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:59,780
All right. All right.
We split Frank's share from now on.

945
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,830
You're a schmuck, Frank.

946
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,300
If they would take
all that energy, see...

947
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:14,470
put it into
straight police work...

948
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:15,940
we'd have the city
cleaned up in a week.

949
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,440
They'd clean up.
There'd be no crime.

950
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:28,120
If I could work alone...
That's the thing, see?

951
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:30,850
If I could just get... Work alone.
But they don't like that.

952
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,020
They don't want that.
They want to suck you in.

953
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,890
You go over
the same thing, Paco.

954
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:40,160
So fucking corrupt. Everybody,
everyone. Nobody giving a shit!

955
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:43,400
There's gotta be a way
to wipe it out, goddamn it.

956
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:46,130
Let's get out of here for a while,
huh, honey? Let's go to a movie.

957
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:49,660
Quit handling me! What are you
doing? How am I gonna go to a movie?

958
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:53,230
They'd kill me if they knew!
You think that hasn't happened?

959
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:57,150
Either you're exploding, or you're
lying around like a catatonic!

960
01:18:57,220 --> 01:19:00,670
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

961
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:04,050
All I care about is you!
That's all that matters to me.

962
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,720
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this...

963
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:11,200
Scared, miserable,
dreading to go to work.

964
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,200
It's tearing me apart!

965
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:16,830
And then I get sick of hearing
about it, and I start hating myself.

966
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,740
You didn't like my being a cop,
so don't give me that shit.

967
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:26,210
I love you! I want to marry you!
I want to have children with you!

968
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,110
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Why don't you get out?

969
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:34,180
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.

970
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,920
Well, do it.

971
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:53,700
- What do you got?
- Would you bust whitey?

972
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:55,710
Try me. Try me.

973
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:59,740
This guy's heavy.
He's Italian.

974
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:03,510
Mobbed up.
Still interested?

975
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:06,420
Stop fuckin' around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

976
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:11,050
He's a loan shark,
runs a big numbers operation.

977
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,650
This mother's so cocksure...

978
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:16,990
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

979
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,500
Where's the drop?

980
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:07,170
Hold it!

981
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,910
I'm a police officer.

982
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:11,350
And...

983
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,520
Wait a minute.
You're under arrest.

984
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,890
- I thought you were a junkie.
- I'll take that wad in your pocket.

985
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,860
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know. I'm a joke.

986
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:27,160
What are you doin'?
What's that?

987
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:31,630
Put that away, or you're in more
trouble. Give me your car keys.

988
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,600
Where they been
hiding you, kid?

989
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,770
Wouldn't you like to know?

990
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:46,640
Hold this guy for booking.
Get a rap sheet on him.

991
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,650
I'm gonna search his car.

992
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,540
Where's Corsaro?

993
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,550
Smith took him upstairs.

994
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,950
I swear to God, I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie.

995
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,730
Listen, Rudy, you should
see some of the...

996
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,010
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?

997
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:50,210
You. Get over here
and empty your pockets.

998
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,550
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. Do what I say.

999
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,090
- Get over here.
- He's gonna get nasty about it.

1000
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,920
You're fucking right!

1001
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:01,690
Hey, Frank, cool it, huh?

1002
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,390
Lean, motherfuck!
Spread!

1003
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,800
Frank. Hey, Frank, Rudy's on.
He's good people.

1004
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:09,430
Stay the fuck outta this!

1005
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:12,470
You fuck!

1006
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:15,900
What's this?
What's this?

1007
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:17,910
Get in! Get in!

1008
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:10,760
Serpico.
Got that record check on Corsaro.

1009
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,670
You want to read something?

1010
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:32,010
It's about your pal Corsaro.

1011
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,880
Here, read it.
Read it!

1012
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,480
He did 15 years.
You know what for?

1013
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,690
For killing a cop.
He's a fucking cop killer.

1014
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,500
- It's good to see you again.
- I've had it. I'm finished.

1015
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:00,200
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it. I gotta get out.

1016
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,800
If I have to go back to uniform,
I'm going back to uniform.

1017
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,480
I can't wait for Delaney to call.
I can't play their game anymore.

1018
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:09,490
The commissioner didn't
get in touch with you?

1019
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,490
Not a word. No investigation,
no undercover work, nothing!

1020
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,760
- I had no idea, Frank.
- It's only fair to tell you.

1021
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:19,300
I've been to outside agencies.
I'll go to more if I have to.

1022
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,560
What outside agencies?

1023
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:25,870
Holy Mother of God! Frank, we wash
our own laundry around here!

1024
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:30,640
- You could be brought up on charges!
- We do not wash our own laundry!

1025
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,140
- It just gets dirtier!
- You are in trouble!

1026
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,340
I don't care if I'm in trouble.
I don't care who gets it.

1027
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:39,150
- If I have to go to outside agencies...
- Stay away from outside agencies!

1028
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,190
- Where am I gonna go?
- You hear me?

1029
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,480
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait until you hear from me.

1030
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,460
- I've been waiting for 1 1/2 years.
- I'll get back to you.

1031
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,790
That's not enough!
Where am I gonna go?

1032
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,900
It's my life, you fuck!

1033
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:57,770
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.

1034
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,680
For this precinct,
cases reported...

1035
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:13,340
Murder... 14 for August,
20 for September, 23...

1036
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,760
Serpico.

1037
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,690
Inspector Palmer?

1038
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:23,400
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1039
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,560
are waiting to see you.

1040
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,230
You want to come
to my office?

1041
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,780
Captain McClain called me.

1042
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:41,940
I briefed Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1043
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,480
on your allegations.

1044
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:49,110
The question is, in all these
months, why didn't you come to us?

1045
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,090
Well...

1046
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:59,190
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir, and...

1047
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:01,700
you told...

1048
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:04,360
I mean,
you told Captain McClain...

1049
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,870
that the division was as clean
as a hound's tooth.

1050
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:10,670
You think you're the only honest cop
on the force, Serpico?

1051
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,840
My record's clear.

1052
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:15,040
Inspector Gilbert's just
come from the commissioner's...

1053
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,050
confidential
investigation unit.

1054
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:20,980
Then you must have
heard something. I mean...

1055
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,790
I don't understand.

1056
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,490
Commissioner Delaney has known
about this from the beginning.

1057
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:32,360
No, I didn't hear a thing.

1058
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:35,630
But I understand
your frustration, Frank...

1059
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,800
believe me.

1060
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:41,000
I mean, it's sort of like
trying to punch your way...

1061
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,170
out of a paper bag,
right?

1062
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,910
What outside agencies
have you been to, Frank?

1063
01:27:56,890 --> 01:27:59,360
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

1064
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,230
We ought to ask Serpico directly
if he's gonna cooperate or not.

1065
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,230
- Come on.
- We've gotta know...

1066
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,790
if there's any real basis
for an investigation.

1067
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:13,640
Well, I...

1068
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,800
I'll have to think that...

1069
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,370
I'm gonna have to think
about that.

1070
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:21,610
What is there
to think about?

1071
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,380
I don't see how the division
can investigate itself, sir.

1072
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,420
You've got a point there.

1073
01:28:29,490 --> 01:28:33,320
But you would cooperate with
an impartial investigation, right?

1074
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,960
Yeah. Up to a point.
As long as I'm not involved.

1075
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:46,130
I just want to go someplace
where I can do my job.

1076
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:48,770
That's fair enough.

1077
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,780
We'll be in touch.

1078
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:56,880
Inspector Palmer?

1079
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:59,040
May I see you a minute?

1080
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,520
Was it necessary to let everyone
in the station house...

1081
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:09,360
know I was comin' in here
to see these guys?

1082
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:11,760
You believe from what you now know
that a full-scale investigation...

1083
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:13,230
is warranted?

1084
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,960
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.

1085
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:23,440
But, sir...

1086
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:26,040
shouldn't headquarters
handle something like this?

1087
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:30,880
No.
You're all experienced men.

1088
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:35,350
Chief Gallagher here will be
available for consultation.

1089
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,790
Commissioner...

1090
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:49,200
Serpico claims that...

1091
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:52,530
McClain talked to you about
this whole thing some time ago.

1092
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:56,310
Yes. I seem to remember
something about that.

1093
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:05,610
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park."

1094
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:07,680
We need a location!

1095
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:10,620
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off.

1096
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:14,350
Now, what do you want? The whole
thing signed, sealed, delivered?

1097
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:17,260
You're conducting this
investigation, not me.

1098
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,390
Lieutenant Smith...
Let's get back to him.

1099
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:23,840
Lieutenant Smith.
Lieutenant Smith said to me...

1100
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:27,700
if I didn't want the money that
he would stash it in his attic.

1101
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,870
I'll have him transferred
in the morning.

1102
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:32,740
Fuck him.
How about transferring me?

1103
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:47,320
I hear you been
vouchering pad money...

1104
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:51,190
over to a confidential
investigation squad.

1105
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:55,760
Oh, yeah? How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

1106
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,770
You won't find anything
on Serpico.

1107
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:02,840
He's clean.

1108
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,340
Right?

1109
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:09,410
You practicing your frisk?

1110
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,480
I'm looking to buy
a used tape recorder.

1111
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:22,360
They're feeling me up every day.
How am I gonna wear a wire?

1112
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:23,860
Come on, Frank.

1113
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:28,960
Wearing a wire means testifying to
corroborate the tape, right? Right.

1114
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,030
I'm not testifying.

1115
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:34,270
I gotta put a dime
in the parking meter.

1116
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:37,830
Ragland, put a dime
in the parking meter for Serpico.

1117
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:47,750
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, district attorney?

1118
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,250
Yeah, I watch television.

1119
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:53,730
Frank, I want to compliment you
for coming forward like this.

1120
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:55,730
It's unique.

1121
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,820
It's uniquely unique.
You should be proud of yourself.

1122
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:02,930
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shitheels...

1123
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,230
with Frank Serpico
as my star witness.

1124
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:09,870
Mr. Tauber, you and everybody
in this room can go to hell...

1125
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,380
'cause I'm not testifying.

1126
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:14,540
- Listen...
- Wait just a second, Frank.

1127
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:16,950
You have nothing to fear.
You're not gonna be singled out.

1128
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,380
I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows...

1129
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:21,220
- Wait a minute...
- if it meant something...

1130
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:23,650
- but this investigation is bullshit.
- Mind if I say something?

1131
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,450
Bullshit. You're not going after
corruption in the department...

1132
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:28,260
the division, the Bronx.

1133
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,260
A few flunky cops
thrown to the wolves...

1134
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:33,390
to protect Delaney and those guys
who've known about this for years...

1135
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:36,330
and won't do a fuckin' thing about
it, that's why I won't testify.

1136
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:14,970
- Hey, what's this?
- Exactly what it says.

1137
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,630
I'm splitting.

1138
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:18,800
"Splitting." I never read
anything so stupid in my life.

1139
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,210
"I'm leaving. If you want to
discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."

1140
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,480
I didn't feel like another
blood-and-guts scene.

1141
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:26,520
I figured you wouldn't
be able to shout in here.

1142
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,650
I can shout anywhere!

1143
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:35,730
I won't shout.

1144
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,920
Sit down, sit down.

1145
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:54,310
It's just gonna go on
and on, Paco.

1146
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:56,470
It isn't gonna
get any better.

1147
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,880
And if you quit,
somehow I'll be blamed.

1148
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,190
How could you leave
the man you love...

1149
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:15,360
future father of your kids?

1150
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,830
You never said anything
like that to me before.

1151
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:26,240
And if I come back,
you won't say it again.

1152
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:32,040
You want to be free
and unattached...

1153
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,580
to go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

1154
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:37,090
My cause.

1155
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:43,820
I felt so safe with you...

1156
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,190
so loving.

1157
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,310
Stay with me, Laurie.

1158
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:03,550
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No, no.

1159
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,820
- What do I owe you for that?
- Excuse me.

1160
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:20,830
Here.

1161
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,330
Here's $2.00.

1162
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:41,720
What are you doing?

1163
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:47,760
Do you want to walk away,
or should I?

1164
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,030
I'm not gonna walk away.

1165
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:54,500
It's finished!

1166
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:05,910
Who do you think you are, trying to
pull that "no testifying" bullshit on me?

1167
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:09,750
Chief Green,
I know your reputation.

1168
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:14,120
Look, maybe if you were borough
commander when this thing started...

1169
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:17,590
run this investigation yourself,
I'd feel different about testifying.

1170
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:19,990
But the truth is,
you're coming in after the fact.

1171
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:24,390
You're like a quiff who says
she won't, then maybe she will.

1172
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:27,060
I'm like a quiff
who's been fucked over...

1173
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:31,090
for a year and a half by guys like
Kellogg, McClain, Delaney...

1174
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:34,070
I'm not Kellogg,
McClain or Delaney!

1175
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:36,970
Frank, it won't be
just flunky cops.

1176
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,740
This is only the beginning.
This could be the biggest thing...

1177
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:42,980
- since the Harry Gross case.
- And meanwhile, where am I?

1178
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:45,540
I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?

1179
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:48,380
I'm totally isolated in the
department. I don't have a friend.

1180
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:51,950
Don't give me that bullshit. I've
been puttin' cops away for 30 years!

1181
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:55,480
My name's an obscenity on every
precinct shithouse wall in the city.

1182
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,400
- I've observed that, sir.
- Friends! I fought my way up...

1183
01:36:59,470 --> 01:37:01,160
as a Jew in the department in the
days you were supposed to have...

1184
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:03,930
an uncircumcised shamrock
between your legs.

1185
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,870
I have this nightmare
I'm on 5th Avenue...

1186
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:08,500
watching the St. Patrick's Day
parade and I have a coronary...

1187
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,700
and 9,000 cops
march happily over my body.

1188
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:14,710
Friends. I haven't got a friend
on the force, either, Serpico.

1189
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:17,150
- I'll be your friend, Chief.
- I'm not lookin' for any.

1190
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:20,050
- I'll make an exception for you.
- Frank, you're a good cop.

1191
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:23,280
<i>Stop being a prima donna.
Cut out the shticklech.</i>

1192
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,480
I don't understand.

1193
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,530
How am I being a prima donna?
I want to protect myself.

1194
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,690
We're gonna get the indictments.
You're gonna have to testify.

1195
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:45,640
<i>Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.</i>

1196
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:48,540
<i>Ready on the firing line.</i>

1197
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:40,130
What are you gonna tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

1198
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:44,460
Depends on
what they ask me.

1199
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:47,030
Suppose they ask you
who's taking money?

1200
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:49,370
What I don't know,
I don't know.

1201
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,170
But you do know, Frank.

1202
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:56,240
Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't
want to see anything happen to you.

1203
01:38:56,310 --> 01:39:00,650
But you gotta understand,
a lot of people could get hurt here.

1204
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,280
I'm not saying anything's going to
happen. I'm saying it could happen.

1205
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:07,150
I mean, there's lots of ways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.

1206
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:09,390
They can just not be there
when you need them.

1207
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:12,690
Somebody come at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

1208
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,860
Or they can send you
in first enough times...

1209
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:17,130
until finally one day you're gonna
walk in the wrong door.

1210
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:23,640
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank!

1211
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:29,540
I have nothing more. Does anyone
have any further questions?

1212
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:32,880
- Yes, Mrs. Crist?
- If I may, Mr. Knowles, thank you.

1213
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:35,610
Officer Serpico came
to the 7th Division...

1214
01:39:35,690 --> 01:39:37,620
more than a year
and a half ago.

1215
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:41,060
All during that time, the things
he's told us were taking place.

1216
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:43,790
Now, why didn't
Officer Serpico...

1217
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,920
report these criminal activities
when he first encountered them?

1218
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,160
- I'd like to answer that.
- Mr. Chairman...

1219
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:55,970
Mrs. Crist's question isn't material
or relevant to the present inquiry.

1220
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,270
- Although I want to make it clear...
- I'd like to answer that.

1221
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:01,940
Officer Serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way...

1222
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:04,310
or guilty of
any infraction of the law.

1223
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:06,320
Quite the contrary.

1224
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:09,910
The District Attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

1225
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:13,420
Very well. Officer Serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

1226
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:16,480
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1227
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:21,060
Why didn't you tell him
about Delaney and Kellogg?

1228
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:23,930
Frank, this was a grand jury
about police officers...

1229
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,660
actively engaged in corruption.

1230
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:29,400
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

1231
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:33,410
That's crap and you know it, because
even a dumb cop like me knows...

1232
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,070
a prosecutor can take a grand jury
anywhere it wants to take it.

1233
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:39,840
Now, you never led me anywhere
near the real problems...

1234
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,180
Nothing about the bosses,
the brass...

1235
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,120
how corruption like this could exist
without anybody knowing about it.

1236
01:40:46,190 --> 01:40:48,790
Now, a few flunky cops
in the Bronx. That's it.

1237
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:51,560
None of the shit in Queens,
Brooklyn, Manhattan?

1238
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:53,530
While you're at it,
why don't you mention Kansas City?

1239
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,000
Well, "the biggest thing since
Harry Gross." That's what you said.

1240
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,500
All right! Look, Frank.

1241
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:02,340
You got guts, integrity.

1242
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:05,400
There's going to be a detective's
gold shield in this for you.

1243
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:11,570
Now, that's terrific.
That's good.

1244
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,240
Maybe this is
what it's all about.

1245
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,180
Maybe I should take my
gold shield and forget it.

1246
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:17,550
I know you've been through
an ordeal, Frank.

1247
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:23,820
I'm a marked man in this department.
For what?

1248
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:27,230
- I've already arranged a transfer.
- To where? China?

1249
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,940
That takes a 14-shot clip.

1250
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:44,040
You expecting an army?

1251
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,050
No, just a division.

1252
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:52,510
Tauber, did you know I've had
reports about Serpico being a fag?

1253
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:55,290
He used to hang out
in the BCI washroom.

1254
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,560
That's stupid, Commissioner,
and you know it.

1255
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:02,730
Mr. Commissioner, a gold shield
for Serpico at this time...

1256
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,430
would convince
a lot of people...

1257
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:06,030
Not while I'm commissioner.

1258
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,690
Commander's office?

1259
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,090
It's down that corridor.

1260
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:36,830
Hey, Serpico. Do you know what
they're saying in the Bronx?

1261
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,770
That you spilled your
guts to the grand jury.

1262
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:42,740
Say it isn't so, Serpico.

1263
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:46,600
It isn't so.

1264
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,770
We know how to handle
guys like you.

1265
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:52,980
I ought to cut
your tongue out.

1266
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:00,520
Don't move.

1267
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,880
Officer Serpico
reporting for duty, sir.

1268
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:36,130
I'm Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.

1269
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:40,160
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

1270
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:43,330
Anybody in this command
you want to work with?

1271
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:50,670
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

1272
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:57,070
All right. You can't find anybody
you want to work with, Frank...

1273
01:43:57,150 --> 01:43:59,380
I'll work with you.

1274
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:01,390
Is that all right?

1275
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:14,090
How do we get past
the lookouts?

1276
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:15,890
How many you got?
One.

1277
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:21,000
There's two.

1278
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:23,870
- Yeah, there's a guy.
- There's three of them.

1279
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:26,140
It's four buildings away. We could
try to get down the fire escape.

1280
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:28,300
Get in behind him.
What do you think?

1281
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:32,250
- Look good to you?
- Yeah, let's go.

1282
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:17,390
What do you think?
Want to try it?

1283
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,110
- Oh, boy.
- You all right?

1284
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:40,120
Yeah. I feel just
like a cop again.

1285
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:42,450
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1286
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,570
Close up!

1287
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,440
Wait, Frank!

1288
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:17,950
Come on!

1289
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,830
I ain't got nothing!

1290
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:32,970
Beat it, fuck face!

1291
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:37,610
Get the other one! Get out of here!
Get up against the wall.

1292
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:43,770
What the hell's goin' on here?
Who the hell are you?

1293
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:45,680
- Who are you?
- The police! Who the hell you think?

1294
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:48,380
Get the fuck against the wall.
Up, up, up!

1295
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:52,110
- Let me see your shield.
- All right. There's my shield.

1296
01:46:52,190 --> 01:46:54,850
- Where are you from?
- The borough. Manhattan 8th.

1297
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:58,050
No, goddamn it! I just paid
the borough this morning!

1298
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:02,320
What the hell kind of
shakedown is this?

1299
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,490
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1300
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:08,640
Nobody.
I didn't pay no...

1301
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,800
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1302
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:14,040
I didn't pay nobody.
Now let go of me.

1303
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:19,670
We followed up,
and there's no doubt about it.

1304
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:23,150
The pad here in Manhattan
is bigger...

1305
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:27,950
and it's more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

1306
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:31,050
The pickups here are made...
You want to get this...

1307
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:34,360
The pickups are made by...

1308
01:47:34,430 --> 01:47:37,300
retired policemen.

1309
01:47:37,370 --> 01:47:40,860
That way, no plainclothesmen
are directly involved.

1310
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:45,170
Now, we need investigative help
on this one, Chief.

1311
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:51,410
If you need investigative help
and you don't trust your own men...

1312
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:54,510
why don't you requisition some
recruits from the police academy?

1313
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:04,380
With all due respect,
sir...

1314
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:09,330
backing us up is the only hope
the police department has got.

1315
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:13,060
Good cops would come forward if they
thought there was encouragement...

1316
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:15,470
in the department to do so, and if
they thought it would do any good.

1317
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:17,470
If there's no encouragement,
they're not gonna do it.

1318
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:21,100
I've done a lot more than most
people to defend and preserve...

1319
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:24,610
the image of this department
and protect Commissioner Delaney...

1320
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:28,580
against reckless and irresponsible
assaults from outside agencies.

1321
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:32,420
That's it, huh?

1322
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:36,150
I mean, that's what's
really important, isn't it?

1323
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:38,320
That's what
you want to know...

1324
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:41,660
what outside agencies
I've been to, right?

1325
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,960
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, prick.</i>

1326
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:47,160
- Who is this?
- Frank.

1327
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:51,010
<i>- How are you? Where are you?
- I'm ready to go to the Times.</i>

1328
01:48:51,970 --> 01:48:56,070
It's a goddamn
serious step, Frank.

1329
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:58,740
I don't know if
the timing is right.

1330
01:49:01,450 --> 01:49:04,250
Look, I want it to get on
the record, that's all...

1331
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,750
in case something
should happen to me.

1332
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:12,390
I want it on the record.

1333
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:16,830
I don't know if we
carry enough weight.

1334
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,590
<i>I don't know if the New York Times
will go that far out on a limb...</i>

1335
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:22,930
on the say-so
of two flunky cops.

1336
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,970
Suppose an inspector
were to come with us?

1337
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:35,010
You know, I got 20 years
on the force.

1338
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:39,420
Just bought this place.
I signed a 500-year mortgage on it.

1339
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:42,720
- Turn that thing off out there!
- Come on. Everybody to bed.

1340
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:44,820
- Aw, Mom!
- Turn that damn thing down!

1341
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:46,830
Come on, now.
Go on upstairs.

1342
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,950
You said we could go
to bed late!

1343
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:53,530
This is against department
regulations, you both know that.

1344
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:57,900
If they want to throw the book
at me, they can do it.

1345
01:49:57,970 --> 01:50:00,070
If I left the force...

1346
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,540
I don't know
what I could do.

1347
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:13,290
Okay, I made my little speech.
I'll back you up a hundred percent.

1348
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:20,490
<i>Times and the News.
I got the money, fellas.</i>

1349
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,500
Here you go, here you go,
here you go.

1350
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,000
<i>Newsweek, please.</i>

1351
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,340
Holy sh... Jeez!

1352
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:32,300
Aw, Christ!

1353
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:35,240
You could almost predict
the numbers they're gonna do.

1354
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:37,570
Delaney's gonna issue
some phony denial.

1355
01:50:37,650 --> 01:50:40,620
Somebody from the mayor's office
will say something noble.

1356
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:45,310
Delaney'll change his tune. Finally,
the mayor will appoint a commission.

1357
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:48,580
"Mayor Lindsay announced the
formation of a five-man committee...

1358
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:51,490
to review the city procedures for
investigating police corruption."

1359
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:54,620
How come I'm not
in the first paragraph?

1360
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:56,130
Unbelievable!

1361
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:04,810
<i>The Times' report smells
of the familiar smear tactics...</i>

1362
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:06,900
of McCarthyism.

1363
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:11,440
<i>- I have issued a statement...
- We here at city hall...</i>

1364
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:14,210
The mayor appointed a special
investigation commission...

1365
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,220
<i>to be headed
by Whitman Knapp.</i>

1366
01:51:16,290 --> 01:51:17,720
Yeah, come.

1367
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:28,230
It's your reward. It's a transfer
to narcotics, Brooklyn South.

1368
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:31,460
You're still in clothes. You get
a tin shield, not a gold one.

1369
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,170
I miss you already, Frank.

1370
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:46,410
Look, Frank...

1371
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:51,810
it's narcotics.

1372
01:51:51,890 --> 01:51:54,410
You be careful.

1373
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:57,890
It's very easy to get hurt...

1374
01:51:59,430 --> 01:52:00,860
and to...

1375
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:04,160
to be set up.

1376
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:48,230
Get in.

1377
01:53:05,190 --> 01:53:07,290
You're not wired,
are you?

1378
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,260
Okay, you cocksucker.

1379
01:53:11,770 --> 01:53:14,790
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit...

1380
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:18,270
but down here,
800 a month is chicken feed.

1381
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:22,670
Last week,
one dope dealer...

1382
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:25,800
sent out these guys
making pickups.

1383
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,370
40,000 each.

1384
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:31,750
We let 'em collect it all,
and then hit 'em.

1385
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:35,420
120,000 split four ways.

1386
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:38,890
That's serious money.

1387
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,520
And with that,
you don't fuck around.

1388
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:46,700
- I got the message.
- Good.

1389
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:48,940
Now get the fuck out.

1390
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:57,040
The guy's name is Limbo.

1391
01:53:57,110 --> 01:53:59,440
He just uses this place,
his girlfriend's brother's place.

1392
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:02,070
He's a pusher... heroin.

1393
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:04,410
- We'll drive around to the corner.
- Right.

1394
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:08,150
You keep in sight out front. When
you spot somebody who's dirty...

1395
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,320
take off your glasses
and wipe 'em.

1396
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:12,920
- Got it?
- Right. Okay.

1397
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:23,700
We stay around here very long,
we're gonna get spotted.

1398
01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:27,360
Well, Frank, why don't you
go up there and check it out?

1399
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:30,730
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

1400
01:55:30,810 --> 01:55:33,540
I'll take you shopping.

1401
01:57:18,210 --> 01:57:19,650
Limbo.

1402
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,410
Police. Freeze!

1403
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,510
Police officer.
All right, up against the wall.

1404
01:57:56,590 --> 01:58:00,820
Get your hands up against that wall.
Get up. All right.

1405
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:03,790
- Palms on the wall and spread 'em.
- Get those hands up!

1406
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:05,920
- Come on. Spread 'em!
- Get your feet apart.

1407
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,990
- I saw the buy.
- Let's get Limbo. Julio!

1408
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:11,330
- You all right, baby?
- Yeah, yeah. I got 'em.

1409
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,260
Police officer!

1410
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:29,380
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

1411
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:32,510
Go down the fire escape!

1412
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:52,330
Police! Throw out your guns
and come out with your hands up!

1413
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:29,760
- Wait. What do you got here?
- It's Mr. and Mrs. Serpico, sir.

1414
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,770
Okay. Go ahead.

1415
02:00:37,050 --> 02:00:40,040
- Where's our son?
- They're bringing him from X-ray.

1416
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,550
- We want to see him.
- Just a few minutes.

1417
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:12,610
Mr. and Mrs. Serpico...

1418
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:16,780
the news is better
than we expected.

1419
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:21,150
Thank God the bullet
was a small caliber.

1420
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:22,760
It didn't enter the brain...

1421
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:26,520
or strike the spinal cord.

1422
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,520
He's on the critical list...

1423
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:33,800
but his condition
seems to be stable.

1424
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:36,970
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

1425
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:14,100
Stay out of there.
Didn't they tell you?

1426
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,640
What?

1427
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:19,080
The word is, don't talk to him.
He's no fuckin' good.

1428
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:31,550
- How you doing, kid?
- Hello, Sid.

1429
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:40,230
How are you?

1430
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:45,840
You wanna read my fan mail?

1431
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:47,840
Sure.

1432
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:50,000
You're a big shot now, huh?

1433
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:21,840
I want you to get those
fucking cops away from my door.

1434
02:03:32,650 --> 02:03:36,220
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

1435
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:37,820
Naturally.

1436
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:44,100
Heinemann and Julio
are cleared.

1437
02:03:44,170 --> 02:03:46,730
The three of you are up for
exceptional merit awards.

1438
02:03:48,270 --> 02:03:50,200
That's very funny.

1439
02:03:55,510 --> 02:03:57,980
That's very funny.

1440
02:03:59,210 --> 02:04:00,650
Francesco, you love me?

1441
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:05,390
I always had a thing for you, Sid.
You know that.

1442
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:10,950
Your gold shield's
come through.

1443
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:41,620
What's this for?

1444
02:04:45,230 --> 02:04:47,920
For being an honest cop?

1445
02:04:50,330 --> 02:04:53,500
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

1446
02:04:57,910 --> 02:05:00,880
You tell them
they can shove it.

1447
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:08,280
I don't want it.

1448
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:48,660
Oh, well.

1449
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:56,420
Well, Frank,
the facts are these.

1450
02:05:56,500 --> 02:06:00,130
You'll have to stay on leave
of absence for a few months.

1451
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:04,070
In all probability, the hearing
in your left ear won't come back.

1452
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:06,770
Two bullet fragments are still
lodged there in the bony portion.

1453
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:08,470
One is very close to
the carotid artery...

1454
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:11,310
<i>and you'll have to be checked
from time to time.</i>

1455
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:13,780
<i>Your left side will
feel stiff occasionally.</i>

1456
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:18,110
<i>Once in a great while you may
experience some dizziness.</i>

1457
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:20,310
<i>But in general,
you'll be okay.</i>

1458
02:06:38,770 --> 02:06:41,070
Through my appearance
here today...

1459
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:44,170
I hope that police officers in
the future will not experience...

1460
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:47,840
the same frustration and anxiety
that I was subjected to...

1461
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:51,220
for the past five years
at the hands of my superiors...

1462
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:54,220
because of my attempt
to report corruption.

1463
02:06:54,290 --> 02:06:59,060
I was made to feel that I had
burdened them with an unwanted task.

1464
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:02,690
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist...

1465
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:04,700
in which an honest police officer
can act...

1466
02:07:04,770 --> 02:07:09,430
without fear of ridicule
or reprisal from fellow officers.

1467
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:13,100
Police corruption cannot exist
unless it is at least tolerated...

1468
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:15,300
at higher levels
in the department.

1469
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:18,710
Therefore, the most important result
that can come from these hearings...

1470
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:22,910
is a conviction by police officers
that the department will change.

1471
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:25,150
In order to ensure this...

1472
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:28,210
an independent,
permanent investigative body...

1473
02:07:28,290 --> 02:07:32,090
dealing with police corruption,
like this commission, is essential.
