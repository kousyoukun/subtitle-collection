1
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:23,976
Man:
Car 2118. Call greenpoint hospital.

2
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,388
Tell them we're bringing in
a wounded cop.

3
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,434
Eighth precinct. Yeah.

4
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,388
Jesus Christ

5
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,809
Guess who got shot.

6
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:01,806
Serpico.

7
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:05,680
Think a cop did it?

8
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,558
I know six cops said they'd like to.

9
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:27,521
- Hello?
- Burnham: Sidney?

10
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:30,472
New York times. Serpico's been shot.

11
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:34,304
- Oh, my god.
Burnham: They're taking him to greenpoint.

12
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:35,517
I'll see you there.

13
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,896
Man: Watch it.

14
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:06,346
Commissioner: To be a police officer
means to believe in the law.

15
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,514
And to enforce it impartially...

16
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:11,021
Respecting
the equality of all men...

17
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:14,806
And the dignity and worth
of every individual.

18
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:18,688
Every day your life
will be on the line ..

19
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,221
And also your character.

20
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,639
You'll need integrity, courage...

21
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:28,102
Nonesty, compassion, courtesy...

22
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:32,105
Perseverance and Patience.

23
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:36,639
You men are now prepared
to join the war against crime...

24
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:40,772
And put the theory you have learned
into practice on the streets.

25
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:52,438
The same time, the same place.
Both reports.

26
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,972
I already made out a 424.

27
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,513
- You covering this, lieutenant?
- Yes, chief green.

28
00:04:57,691 --> 00:04:59,771
Who was with serpico?

29
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:02,601
- Heinemann and Julio.
- I want them interrogated.

30
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:05,809
I want this conducted as an official
departmental investigation.

31
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:08,437
Transcripts by 9 A.M.

32
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,597
Another thing,
I want a 24-hour guard on serpico.

33
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:25,229
Man: Yes, sir.
You two over there.

34
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:26,931
Commissioner: Anthony sardo.

35
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,555
Ralph sidon.

36
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:38,225
Frank serpico.

37
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,854
Frankie!

38
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:58,889
(Set closer.

39
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,854
Patrolman serpico.

40
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,264
Upstairs. See the roll-call man.

41
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:49,104
Take a map.
Memorize your posts and sectors.

42
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:52,479
This week, 8 to 4. Next week,
4 to midnight. Grab an empty locker.

43
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,514
Any questions, the older guys
will fill you in. Good luck.

44
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,142
Yo. Eight o'clock.

45
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:22,972
Let's go. Come on,
gather round, let's go.

46
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,763
All right, settle down.

47
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:31,597
All right, there's a few announcements
today and two new men.

48
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:35,434
Now, on the board at my left,
you see squad one, blue sector.

49
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:39,597
Squad two, red sector.
Squad three, green sector.

50
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:43,309
Now, we want summonses,
summonses, summonses.

51
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:45,847
Charlie:
I'll help the boys, Florence.

52
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,729
This is frank serpico, Charlie.

53
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,354
- Hello, frank.
- Hello, Charlie.

54
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,684
- How about some creamed chicken?
- Sounds good.

55
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,596
Serpico:
No, I think I'll have a...

56
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,513
How about a roast beef on roll?

57
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:02,180
Yeah, okay. You go through the line.

58
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,354
I'll bring it over.

59
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:07,929
Peluce

60
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,605
it's all fat here.

61
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:17,601
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Come on, take it easy. Sit down.

62
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,810
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

63
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:25,062
Well, I'm not fussy. I don't know
how I'm gonna eat this.

64
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,729
Listen, Charlie's an okay guy.

65
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,684
We give him a break
on double-parking on deliveries.

66
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:37,392
Couldn't I pay for it,
get what I want?

67
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:41,431
Frank, generally you just sort of take
what Charlie gives you.

68
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:52,684
Man: Sector d, David, 1034.
Possible rape in progress.

69
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:57,892
Vicinity of p.S. 218,
grand Avenue and bq expressway.

70
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,978
Hey, Becker, aren't we gonna
take that?

71
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:06,021
Oh, relax, frank. It's not our sector.

72
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,895
Serpico: It's on the borderline.

73
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:11,430
I'm gonna take it.

74
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:14,392
Uh, d sector, 1547, 10-4.

75
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:48,021
Woman: Oh, my god.

76
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,554
Serpico: Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Woman: Ahh!

77
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:56,684
- Police officers.
Boy: Oh, shit.

78
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,808
Don't shoot, now. Be cool.

79
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:03,517
All right. Okay, put your guns away.

80
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:05,054
Put your guns away, man.

81
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:08,972
Come on, goddamn it. I said,
put them motherfucking guns away.

82
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:11,225
I'll cut her, goddamn fit.

83
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,429
Turn the motherfucking light out,
man.

84
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:19,680
I'll cut her, man. I'll cut her.

85
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:23,766
Now, you just be cool, goddamn it.
Just be cool

86
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:25,726
all right. All right.

87
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:28,351
- All right. That's it.
Woman: Unh!

88
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:55,267
The other one took his thing out.

89
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,229
He put it up to my mouth.

90
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:04,729
He held me down.

91
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:09,392
They said if I didn't do it...

92
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,763
They'd kill me.

93
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:19,642
Malone: She's gonna make
a hell of a withess

94
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:21,975
would you like a stretcher?

95
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,221
Muscles, he's all yours.

96
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,309
I'll call you from the hospital.

97
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:29,812
Okay, hard-on.
Who were your playmates?

98
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,891
Hey, frank, you want a piece of this?

99
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,271
No, I wanna fill out the arrest card.

100
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,937
Hey, Charlie.

101
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,438
Let me have five minutes with him.
Sure.

102
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,221
Thanks.

103
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,520
Thank you, Charlie.

104
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:24,846
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?

105
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,683
How come you didn't stay
for the fun?

106
00:14:27,857 --> 00:14:30,267
That's not my kind of fun.

107
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:33,479
Yeah

108
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,312
I wanna talk to you.

109
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:41,476
I wanna take you across the street.
Get you a cup of coffee.

110
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,346
Without cuffs

111
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,017
now, look...

112
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:49,225
I didn't touch you upstairs, right”?

113
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,389
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back.

114
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,350
Understand?

115
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:57,891
Come on.

116
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:05,809
Serpico: Goddamn shame you're gonna take
this whole rap yourself.

117
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,351
I don't know. Maybe you're guilty,
maybe you're not.

118
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,017
Maybe you just went along
for the ride.

119
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:17,804
I got a feeling you just went along.

120
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:21,804
You're the one who got caught.

121
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,221
You never even got your cock out.

122
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,389
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.

123
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,350
Look at you.

124
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:39,187
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.

125
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,350
I don't understand you,
you know that?

126
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,513
What are you,
obligated to those guys?

127
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,145
Fuck it.

128
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:51,850
They left you holding the bag.
You don't owe them nothing.

129
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,687
They're gonna put you away,
you know that?

130
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:59,305
What can I get?

131
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:03,812
Oh, let's see. Kidnapping.

132
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:06,888
Sodomy. Rape.

133
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,645
Are you kidding me?

134
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:13,641
Hey.

135
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,688
You talk to me. Save yourself.

136
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:39,763
You're not gonna send
someone over? Look

137
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:42,180
McCoy, I get one,
I'm gonna lose the other.

138
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,434
Look, serpico, that's muscles' case.
He's off for a couple of days.

139
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:49,309
- I can't cut in.
- They're here now.

140
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:51,392
McCoy: It'll keep.
- No, it won't.

141
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,930
Police officer. Hold it. Hold.

142
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,347
Turn around.

143
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:27,850
Owl

144
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:29,762
- spread!
- Come on, man. Come on.

145
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:32,351
Please take that gun from my head.

146
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:34,934
Turn around slow.

147
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:51,263
We'll take it from here, kid.
You don't have to hang around.

148
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,387
What are you talking about?

149
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,016
That's my collar.

150
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,846
We take the collar.

151
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:04,353
A collar like this don't look good
a patrolman takes it.

152
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:07,679
Now, wait a minute. I don't care
how it looks. I did the work.

153
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:10,096
I broke my ass on this,
it's my collar.

154
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:11,978
You really want the collar, kid”?

155
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:14,263
You know, you can be
brought up on charges.

156
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:16,391
You left your post.
You left the street.

157
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:18,554
Entered the schoolyard
without permission.

158
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:21,312
That's just for openers,
right, penella?

159
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,391
No memo entry. Shit.

160
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,974
You'd be lucky to end up
with a reprimand.

161
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,349
We'll give you an assist
on the arrest, kid.

162
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:41,138
Jim, get out of the way.
What are you doing?

163
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:45,721
What you want me to do?
Go across the street?

164
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,059
- Hey, pasquale.
Pasquale: Hey, Frankie.

165
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,062
- How you doing?
- Okay. How you doing?

166
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,937
- Where's pop?
- Be back in a half-hour.

167
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:19,471
How's it going, Frankie?

168
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,353
Okay. I come to get my shoes.

169
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:24,263
- Yeah.
- Rev it up, rev it up.

170
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,934
- Oh, here they are.
- Frankie. How you doing?

171
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,812
Okay. Good job. Uh-huh.

172
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:33,721
Oh, you people do good work here.

173
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:37,470
So how you doing, Frankie”

174
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,804
you keep asking me that.
What's the matter with you? I'm okay.

175
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:44,683
Well, I thought you were coming over
to the house Saturday night.

176
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:46,766
Ah, I'm sorry, pasquale,
I couldn't make it.

177
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:50,350
Margaret invited marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed...

178
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,513
Oh, now, that's... now, look...

179
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:56,262
I don't like that.
Really, don't invite people over...

180
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,520
If you're not sure I'm gonna come.

181
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,303
I mean it, now.
If I wanna see marianne, I'll call her.

182
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:04,184
What's going on
with you two anyway?

183
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:08,391
Hey, pasquale,
I'm gonna tell you something.

184
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:12,554
See, all day long
I work with cops, right?

185
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:15,184
Now, when I go out, I see marianne.

186
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:16,729
Her father's a cop.

187
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:19,183
Her brother's a cop.
Her uncle's a cop.

188
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:21,562
I got a feeling she's a cop too.

189
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:23,353
Come here.

190
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,854
How you doing on the job?

191
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:27,687
It's got its problems.

192
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:31,096
Mama tells me you're looking
for a new apartment. Is that true?

193
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:34,228
- Yeah.
- So where you going?

194
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,308
I don't know.
I'm looking around by school.

195
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:39,391
N.Y.u.? Greenwich village?

196
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:40,937
Yeah, greenwich village.

197
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:43,221
The old neighborhood's
not good enough?

198
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,394
Tell pop I was here.

199
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:48,474
Yeah. Frankie, Sunday?

200
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,058
Sunday what?

201
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:53,063
Dinner. Huh?

202
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:56,812
- Do me one favor. No marianne.
- I know. No marianne.

203
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:58,808
All right,
a couple of announcements.

204
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:01,470
"Announcing a course
in fingerprint identification...

205
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,512
To be given at John Jay college.

206
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,145
This is for those patrolmen...

207
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:08,020
Who wish to make themselves
eligible for assignment...

208
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,804
To the bureau
of criminal identification, b.C.I...

209
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:14,562
Which is generally considered to be
a path to a detective's gold shield.

210
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,016
Signed, captain mcguire.”

211
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,679
On the board on my left,
you see squad one.

212
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:27,349
Serpico: Hot enough for you?
Man: It's not the heat. It's the humidity.

213
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:30,308
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

214
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:52,975
Barto: Know how long
you're taking on that one?

215
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:57,637
Check one print category,
two, that's plenty.

216
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:02,097
I'm not gonna give a guy a "no record"
when he might have a record.

217
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:06,013
How long you been
with the b.C.L. Now, serpico?

218
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,144
Serpico: All my life.

219
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:11,808
Barto: That's long enough
to know how we do things.

220
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:15,437
Barto. It's not just that.

221
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:17,641
You don't like me.

222
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:21,888
Barto:
B.c.l. Never had a weirdo cop before.

223
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:25,554
Barto, stop bugging me.

224
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:36,391
Serpico: Mama.

225
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,095
Frankie.

226
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,053
Mama.

227
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:15,520
Chloe: Hey.

228
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,679
Wanna buy a puppy?

229
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:29,141
How about that, huh?

230
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:33,012
Where'd you get these dogs?

231
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:36,186
Oh, they're mine.

232
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:39,471
Want one for free?

233
00:24:40,357 --> 00:24:43,266
Ah, no, I'll pay for it.
How much are they?

234
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,554
Five dollars.

235
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,136
You got it.

236
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:55,687
Okay, now, which one of you guys
wanna come with me?

237
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:58,725
What?

238
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,019
Come on.

239
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:04,637
- Listen, will you do me a favor?
Chloe: What?

240
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,850
Just watch the car and my stuff
over here because I'm moving in.

241
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,262
Chloe: Yeah. - Thank you.

242
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,720
Don quixote.

243
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,929
Senorita land?

244
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,304
Mr. serpico.

245
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:11,721
I got my horse here.
Maybe I can drop you someplace.

246
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:13,808
I'm going to work
at the caffe reggio.

247
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:17,224
Oh, caffe reggio.

248
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:20,395
That's fourth street and s.

249
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:22,554
- Macdougal and third.
- Macdougal and third.

250
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:24,345
- Yeah.
- Can I give you a lift?

251
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:25,603
Sure.

252
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:28,353
Jesus what's that?

253
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:30,933
Ah, you got your hands
on my money belt. Don't do that.

254
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,221
That's not a money belt.
That's a gun.

255
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:35,683
- Well, we gotta eat, don't we?
- Ha, ha.

256
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:39,061
What do you need a gun for?

257
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,221
I don't know.
Ever hear of barnum & Bailey?

258
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,058
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm their lion tamer.

259
00:26:43,232 --> 00:26:45,141
- Come on.
- No, it's the truth.

260
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:47,220
I think you're full of shit.
You do?

261
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,638
What do you do?

262
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,100
Oh, me? I'm a...
I'm an actress, a singer...

263
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:55,353
- A dancer and a Buddhist.
- Oh, in that order?

264
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,554
I'm a cop. Would you believe that? Whoo!

265
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:01,890
No, I wouldn't believe it.

266
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:22,845
Serpico: I eslie I eslie.

267
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:24,102
Yeah

268
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:26,977
those leaps that guy made,
what do you call them again?

269
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:28,807
- Jetés.
- Jetés

270
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,516
yeah

271
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:36,019
you try it.

272
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:39,062
All right, how do you start it?
What's your position?

273
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:47,387
Next life come on.

274
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:53,308
What are you reading now, serpico?

275
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,645
My life by Isadora Duncan.

276
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,099
She was a ballet dancer.

277
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:04,182
A belly dancer?

278
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:08,186
No ballet dancer.

279
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:11,891
Ballet you know ballet?

280
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,053
- A little.
- A little bit, huh?

281
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:17,062
- Yoou ever see one”?
- Not close.

282
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:19,807
I've been to the ballet. It's terrific.

283
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:21,686
I've been taking classes. Yeah?

284
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:23,936
Yeah. That's where I go
after I leave here.

285
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:26,187
- Yeah?
- Fantastic for your body.

286
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:28,766
- It builds you up.
- I can tell

287
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,929
- you noticed, huh?
- I noticed.

288
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:32,970
There's five positions.
You know that?

289
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:35,228
Five... you're being short-changed.

290
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:36,933
Oh, no, it's enough, believe me.

291
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:39,266
For what? “Watch.

292
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,099
See? This is the first position.

293
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:44,932
From this position,
I can do anything.

294
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:46,516
You wanna see”? Sure

295
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,394
here we go.

296
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:58,807
Lieutenant steiger, I need a...
No. Later.

297
00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:04,766
Hey, turn off the lights.

298
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,555
Oh, potts. I wanted to read.

299
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,345
Potts: Positions, positions.

300
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:14,266
Positions like that
you don't see in a pretzel factory.

301
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,278
Serpico: Now I gotta do my pee-pee
in the dark.

302
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,395
Oh, she's gotta be a nympho
with positions like that.

303
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:23,520
Hey, serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

304
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:25,603
Barto wants a specimen.

305
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:27,973
I'll look into this matter.

306
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:34,645
What do you got there? Here

307
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,391
potts: Straight ahead.

308
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:41,562
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

309
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,849
I don't see anything over there.

310
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:46,886
Potts: I et me see.

311
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:50,387
Oh, she just pulled down her shade.

312
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,644
- Ah.
- You're some kind of jinx, you know that?

313
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:56,225
That's right, blame me.

314
00:29:57,689 --> 00:30:00,554
Steiger: Hold it, serpico.
What were you two doing?

315
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:03,803
- What?
- In the shit house, in the dark.

316
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:06,516
Were you going down on him?

317
00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:10,640
What are you talking about?

318
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:13,304
You gonna tell me
you were just doing a peeping Tom?

319
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:15,936
You were sucking his cock,
weren't you?

320
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:18,517
- What are you, crazy?
- I'll show you fucking crazy.

321
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:22,220
Last week I found a pair of shorts
with semen on them.

322
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:25,387
There.

323
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:29,974
You're actually accusing me of this?

324
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:36,012
Good morning, captain mcclain.
I'm officer serpico.

325
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,644
I was told I could talk to you, sir.

326
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:44,520
Certainly, son. Come in.

327
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:49,890
Lieutenant steiger
won't make a report.

328
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:53,429
He's too concerned with the image
of his department.

329
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,395
But it... it could affect
your future at the b.C.I.

330
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:03,020
Sir, I'll tell you, uh...

331
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:05,686
Frankly I don't see
any future there.

332
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:08,602
I mean, it's all bullshit
about it being a career path...

333
00:31:08,773 --> 00:31:10,262
Toward being detective.

334
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,179
- I've been there two years now...
- And you want a transfer?

335
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:17,970
Yes, sir. But I don't wanna
go back to uniform.

336
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,602
I'll see what I can do, frank.

337
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:23,512
Francis.

338
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:26,520
You know about my weekend
retreats for catholic officers?

339
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:30,311
No

340
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:33,724
Well, you read that.
It might be of interest to you.

341
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,429
You are a catholic, aren't you?

342
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,350
Yeah. I was baptized.

343
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,012
(Good. Good.

344
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:43,932
Alfie, come on.

345
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:48,812
Paco. Oh, missed you, baby.

346
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:52,977
She's so crazy, that girl. I tell you.

347
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:54,682
Why "paco"?

348
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:56,640
Oh, all my friends call me paco.

349
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,270
Could you do me a favor?

350
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,395
Get my keys out of this pocket for me.
Sure.

351
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,054
Well, uh, what will I call you?

352
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:08,312
Frank or, uh, paco?

353
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:10,933
Paco.

354
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,308
Sally: Leslie

355
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:26,354
- Sally, hi. Larry. This is paco.
Larry: All right.

356
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:28,303
- Hey, man.
Leslie: Larry's a poet.

357
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,561
But he works
for an advertising agency.

358
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,936
And, uh, Sally's an actress,
but she works for a photographer.

359
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:35,852
Sally: Hello.
- Paco's a policeman.

360
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:39,057
- Oh, that's terrific.
- I work for the police department.

361
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:41,262
- Oh, hey. Wow, okay.
- That's really nice.

362
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:43,433
See you.

363
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,269
- How are you?
- Pat's 3 novelist.

364
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,723
But, uh, you're working for an insurance
company now?

365
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:52,182
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. Paco's a policeman.

366
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:54,437
Really? How exciting.

367
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,891
Well, not too.
Right now, I'm filing fingerprints.

368
00:32:58,065 --> 00:33:00,804
Listen, I file insurance policies.

369
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:03,603
We should get together, then.
File or something.

370
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,853
- Hey, that was an improvement.
- I wanna ask you something.

371
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:08,682
How come all your friends...

372
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:11,220
Are on their way to being
somebody else?

373
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,229
Think about that. I wanna ask you
something else too.

374
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,762
Will you do me a big favor?

375
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,894
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

376
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:22,724
You know, let me
just sort of do it myself.

377
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:34,682
Hey, man, are you really a cop?

378
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:37,890
Right. I am.

379
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:41,061
I eslie is a mind-fucker.

380
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:44,392
You gotta be kidding me.
I didn't know that.

381
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,303
What's a mind-fucker?

382
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,435
Well, that's a chick...

383
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:51,811
Who digs intellectual types
and super-bright guys.

384
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:53,719
Oh, yeah?

385
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,515
- Well, she's very perceptive.
- Ha, ha.

386
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:05,887
Pat: You know, Japanese culture
and theater and painting...

387
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:07,599
It's too rigidly stylized.

388
00:34:07,773 --> 00:34:09,932
Well, you know...

389
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:11,470
Yeah, but...

390
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,019
I think after a while

391
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,225
when you get through that,
you start to appreciate the clarity.

392
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:20,887
You know, the authority.

393
00:34:21,107 --> 00:34:23,187
I got a sheepdog. Yeah?

394
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:26,096
There have been sheepdogs
in my family...

395
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:30,932
Dating back for 16 generations.

396
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,054
Dating back to the borgias.

397
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:39,975
The family crest is a sheepdog...

398
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:43,602
- Pissing into a gondola.
- Ha. Oh, shit.

399
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:55,937
Paco, everybody loves you.
I love you.

400
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:10,895
Officer serpico reports.

401
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:14,394
That fucking thing on your lip, it goes.
And get a haircut.

402
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:16,723
- Uh, sir...
- That's an order.

403
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,262
You look like an asshole
with dentures.

404
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:23,352
Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
Sure.

405
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:26,637
Go see captain tolkin.
You've got one foot in shit already.

406
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:30,145
- Put the other one in.
- Where might that be? I wonder, sir.

407
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:37,428
That is one hell of a mustache.
I wish I had the guts.

408
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:43,103
Well, I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

409
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:44,644
You don't have to tell me.

410
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,678
- But I'd like to.
- I thought so.

411
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,349
I think it's time that we started, uh,
to communicate more on the street, sir.

412
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:56,228
You know, the way it is,
we're totally isolated, sir.

413
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:59,387
I mean, we're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

414
00:35:59,564 --> 00:36:02,303
An undercover cop
walks around in disguise...

415
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:07,016
Wearing black shoes and white
socks. Everybody knows who he is.

416
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,269
You made your point.

417
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:11,929
I want you to keep your mustache.

418
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:15,515
And I'd like you to patrol
in your own car.

419
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:18,561
Wear whatever you want.
How does that strike you?

420
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:20,432
I'd like that, sir.

421
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,390
To be honest,
I'm bucking for detective.

422
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:25,019
No shit

423
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,724
- no.
- Ha, ha.

424
00:37:17,523 --> 00:37:19,227
Serpico: Hold it.

425
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,678
Man:
What the hell are you doing?

426
00:37:25,773 --> 00:37:27,762
Oh, Christ.

427
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:33,598
Hey!

428
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:35,644
I'm a police officer. Get over there.

429
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:38,219
Hey! It's me, serpico!

430
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:43,932
Hey, I'm a police officer.
Police officer.

431
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,769
I'm an officer. I'm a police officer.

432
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,804
Jesus, frank, how was I
supposed to recognize you?

433
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:53,766
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you.

434
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,645
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?

435
00:37:57,815 --> 00:38:01,929
You fire without a warning?
Without a fucking brain in your head?

436
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:04,261
Oh, shit.

437
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:09,853
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

438
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:21,182
Holy shit, look at that mess.

439
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:28,470
Filling out forms till next month.
Good.

440
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:30,557
Hey, Jesus, frank...

441
00:38:30,731 --> 00:38:32,890
I know it's a hell of a time
to ask you.

442
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:35,599
I'll have to go through
that ballistics bullshit.

443
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,477
You should.
“It'll look like hell

444
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,478
if I don't have anything
to show for it.

445
00:38:40,773 --> 00:38:42,636
Frank, do me a favor.

446
00:38:43,314 --> 00:38:44,974
Give us the collar?

447
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:51,602
You motherfucker.

448
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:55,852
You want the collar, huh?

449
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:59,061
You don't wanna
fill out forms, right?

450
00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:13,644
(50 ahead.

451
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:18,012
- You're a buddy.
- Oh, I'm a buddy.

452
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,474
Only you tell tolkin I gave it to you.

453
00:39:22,398 --> 00:39:26,103
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample...

454
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:28,932
So that when you become
plainclothes men...

455
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:32,846
You'll be able to identify
the pungent aroma...

456
00:39:33,023 --> 00:39:36,728
And recognize the disorienting
effect of the drug...

457
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:41,269
When you observe them
in narcotics suspects.

458
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,598
Among users of the drug...

459
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:48,228
A marijuana cigarette
is referred to as:

460
00:39:48,398 --> 00:39:53,604
Reefer, stick, roach, joint.

461
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:57,310
The drug itself is referred to as:

462
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:03,812
- Pot, tea, boo, stuff, grass.
- Boo.

463
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:07,306
Hey, this is real good shit.

464
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:12,595
Serpico: I gotta have something to eat.
Blair: Oh, look what it is. Look what it is.

465
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:17,770
It's a potato factory, is what it is.
I have to have some because I love it.

466
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:20,428
I have to have some of that.
We have nothing to...?

467
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:24,811
- I have to have a dime?
- The dime goes in the little slot there.

468
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:27,936
That doesn't work.
It's from the civil war, this machine.

469
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:30,516
Pull on it.
Doesn't doesn't doesn't.

470
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,515
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Shoot it out.

471
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:36,849
Please, I beg of you.
Come out, potatoes, come out.

472
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,640
You're pretty fucking weird for a cop.
Me?

473
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:46,220
You. What about you, buddy? Me?

474
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:48,887
- You're a fucking hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.

475
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:50,470
The two of us.

476
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:54,518
Give me. Unh!

477
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:58,686
Where you supposed to go
from here?

478
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:01,719
Nine-three precinct, plainclothes.

479
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:03,727
Put your gun away.

480
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,344
You?

481
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,094
I'm scheduled to go
on special assignment...

482
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:13,807
With the mayor's department
of investigations, detective squad.

483
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:18,970
That's a gold shield. Yeah

484
00:41:19,856 --> 00:41:21,845
no four years in plainclothes?

485
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,307
- Who do you know?
- It's my business to know people.

486
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:28,890
People who can help.

487
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,973
Unfair.

488
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,268
Unfair.

489
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:35,973
Life is unfair, man.

490
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:39,511
I mean, look, you've got
a feel for the streets, and I, uh...

491
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:42,177
- I got a feel for the politics, I guess.
- Oh, yeah?

492
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:45,845
You and me in one Batmobile,
we could clean up the city in no time.

493
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:48,977
I wonder if we can get candy
out of this machine, though.

494
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:56,973
No, thanks.

495
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:04,515
Well, this is a good place to tell you,
paco.

496
00:42:06,564 --> 00:42:09,678
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

497
00:42:09,856 --> 00:42:11,560
Yeah

498
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:16,678
- what about him?
- I'm gonna marry him in two months.

499
00:42:17,106 --> 00:42:19,686
Unless you marry me.

500
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:33,095
What about the, uh, theater
and your dancing?

501
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:35,223
A girl has to get married sometime.

502
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:40,219
Well, you're a long way
from "sometime," Leslie.

503
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,519
I thought you were committed.

504
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,889
- I am, but...
- Mm-hm_

505
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,894
You are but 7?

506
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:55,056
I can go on working, studying there.

507
00:42:55,897 --> 00:42:58,261
Where? Fort worth?

508
00:42:59,398 --> 00:43:01,227
Amarillo

509
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:03,560
amarillo?

510
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:11,977
Well, am I invited to the wedding?

511
00:43:15,398 --> 00:43:17,102
I'll ask Roy.

512
00:43:21,897 --> 00:43:24,102
Yeah, it's pretty good
in this precinct.

513
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:26,135
Here you go.

514
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:30,349
Usually a 9-to-5 day is the best time
for policy and bookmaking.

515
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:34,599
But if you have to work nights,
like a liquor violation, just call in.

516
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:36,762
Don't worry about quotas right now.

517
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:39,848
A couple of hooker collars
will keep it cool.

518
00:43:49,439 --> 00:43:51,268
Kirby: Serpico...

519
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:53,428
Been holding this for you.

520
00:43:53,606 --> 00:43:55,720
It's from Jewish Max.

521
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,344
Serpico:
First day on the precinct, I get that.

522
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:59,052
This 1s great, frank.

523
00:45:01,939 --> 00:45:04,144
I can open a whole
can of peas with this.

524
00:45:04,314 --> 00:45:05,973
It's scary.

525
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,594
- I wanna protect myself.
- Okay.

526
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:11,806
You know what we do with this?
“What?

527
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,310
We take it to inspector kellogg.

528
00:45:14,897 --> 00:45:17,056
Kellogg? Yeah

529
00:45:19,564 --> 00:45:22,598
kellogg? Didn't he used to be
in plainclothes?

530
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:26,686
Second highest ranking cop in the
whole department of investigations.

531
00:45:26,855 --> 00:45:27,889
So what?

532
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:31,519
I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

533
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,177
He owes me, you understand?

534
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:37,803
He's the most honest cop
I know, frank.

535
00:45:38,481 --> 00:45:40,185
Frank.

536
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:42,015
Trust me.

537
00:45:53,648 --> 00:45:58,512
Things like this were common practice
in the bad old days.

538
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,435
Hard to believe it's still going on.

539
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:07,061
Serpico, don't you think
it's kind of stupid...

540
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,595
Taking an envelope from somebody
you didn't know?

541
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:18,186
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, give me...

542
00:46:18,356 --> 00:46:21,640
- How would I know what was in it?
Kellogg: You, uh...

543
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,219
You have two alternatives:

544
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:27,394
Force me to take you to
the commissioner of investigations.

545
00:46:27,564 --> 00:46:31,098
- He'll drag you in front of a grand jury.
- I don't want that.

546
00:46:31,314 --> 00:46:33,348
Oh, I can understand that.

547
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:35,261
Word will get out.

548
00:46:35,439 --> 00:46:37,677
Before it's all over.

549
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:40,265
They'll find you facedown
in the east river.

550
00:46:44,897 --> 00:46:46,886
What's the other alternative?

551
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:48,561
Forget it.

552
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:52,890
Well, what do I do with this?

553
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:16,102
Serpico: Hey, sarge?
Brown: Yeah?

554
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:18,056
(Got a minute?

555
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:19,935
Yeah

556
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:24,265
a colored cop gave me this.
I didn't know what to do with it

557
00:47:29,855 --> 00:47:32,844
Well, I'll send it on
to the benevolent association.

558
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:45,893
Serpico: Alfie

559
00:48:08,314 --> 00:48:10,143
Is that bjorling?

560
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,556
No it's di Stefano.

561
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:22,893
I was sure it was bjorling.

562
00:48:24,356 --> 00:48:26,060
No

563
00:48:30,356 --> 00:48:32,685
You can hear it better over here.

564
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:36,178
- That's an invitation, right”?
- Right.

565
00:48:37,064 --> 00:48:38,802
With coffee.

566
00:48:39,189 --> 00:48:41,677
I have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

567
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:46,807
Why don't you call in sick?
Perfect place.

568
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:50,510
Not me.

569
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,094
You dedicated or something?

570
00:48:52,314 --> 00:48:54,723
That's right, I'm dedicated.

571
00:48:54,897 --> 00:48:58,727
- Most men can't stand it.
- Well, what do they know?

572
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:00,227
I like your garden.

573
00:49:04,356 --> 00:49:06,265
Hey.

574
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,764
Love my garden.

575
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:11,803
Okay. I love your garden.

576
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,935
You know what they say, don't you?

577
00:49:16,563 --> 00:49:18,098
No, what do they say?

578
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:22,307
If you love a man's garden,
you gotta love the man.

579
00:49:28,563 --> 00:49:30,677
You like her, Alfie?

580
00:49:32,398 --> 00:49:34,636
All I can tell you, sir,
is I gave it back.

581
00:49:34,814 --> 00:49:37,053
I gotta get out of the 93.

582
00:49:37,231 --> 00:49:40,391
Well, what happened
on your, uh, narcotics application?

583
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:44,552
It looked like it was set until I told them
I was in plainclothes, and that was it.

584
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:49,560
It was like the kiss of death. They think
everybody in clothes is on the take.

585
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,560
Sir, do you know anything
about the Bronx 7th division?

586
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:56,469
I mean, I can go there if I want.
But if it's the same shit, screw it.

587
00:49:56,647 --> 00:50:00,057
I'd rather answer phones, uh, for Spanish
communications unit and go nuts.

588
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:01,969
Come on, Alfie.

589
00:50:03,605 --> 00:50:05,185
Mcclain: Frank.

590
00:50:05,563 --> 00:50:09,928
Did anyone ever tell you that you
have a tendency towards self-pity?

591
00:50:11,563 --> 00:50:14,518
- No, you're the first.
- All right.

592
00:50:14,688 --> 00:50:18,723
Frank, I have a friend up there.
Roy Palmer, an administrative officer.

593
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:20,760
I'll speak with him.

594
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:23,345
- Good. Thank you, sir.
- Bye, frank.

595
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:25,476
- God bless you.
- Right.

596
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,684
- Serpico: Yeah?
- Mcclain: Frank?

597
00:50:35,855 --> 00:50:38,185
- Uh, captain mcclain here.
- Oh, captain mcclain.

598
00:50:38,356 --> 00:50:40,890
- Could you hold on a minute, please?
Mcclain: Sure.

599
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:50,057
Yeah. Sorry. Mcclain: Frank

600
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:51,885
I, uh, saw inspector Palmer tonight.

601
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:55,427
And he assures me the 7th division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

602
00:50:55,605 --> 00:50:58,140
His words, frank.
"Clean as a hound's tooth"

603
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:01,936
- oh, yeah?
Mcclain: / told him he'd get a hard worker.

604
00:51:02,106 --> 00:51:03,719
Wears a beard, speaks Spanish...

605
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:07,261
And would make a superb
undercover man. He was delighted.

606
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,060
That's good news, sir. Thank you.

607
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:13,640
- Thank you very much.
Mcclain: Goodbye, frank. God bless.

608
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:18,427
When did you start doing that?

609
00:51:20,231 --> 00:51:22,469
Mcclain says that Palmer says...

610
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:25,636
That the 7th is
"as clean as a hound's tooth."

611
00:51:26,314 --> 00:51:29,427
Well, if that's true,
your problems are over.

612
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,685
Serpico: Plainclothes division?

613
00:51:38,189 --> 00:51:39,848
Upstairs.

614
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,601
Hey, frank. Serpico: Keough.

615
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:53,227
- How are you? Good to see you.
Serpico: All right.

616
00:51:53,397 --> 00:51:54,886
We heard you were coming.

617
00:51:55,064 --> 00:51:58,552
Hey, listen, say hello to Nate Smith,
frank serpico.

618
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,265
- Jamie morales, frank serpico.
- Serpico.

619
00:52:02,563 --> 00:52:04,893
Hey, baby, you'll love it here.
It's beautiful.

620
00:52:05,064 --> 00:52:07,768
I'll see youse later, right”?
Take 3 little ride with me.

621
00:52:07,939 --> 00:52:10,269
- I gotta make a collar.
Serpico: I should check in first.

622
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:11,768
Keough: Fuck that come on.

623
00:52:21,313 --> 00:52:24,347
Trollo: Ten on Dallas, if Minnesota.
Right.

624
00:52:25,064 --> 00:52:27,018
Green bay, 12 and a half...

625
00:52:27,772 --> 00:52:30,852
You dumb fuck.
We told you this location's hot.

626
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:34,261
- We told you to stay the fuck out.
- Keough...

627
00:52:34,438 --> 00:52:35,973
Nobody told me. Honest.

628
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:38,098
Bullshit

629
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:40,677
- come on, let's take a walk.
Trollo: Hi, kid.

630
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:42,639
- All right, a c-note apiece.
- No way.

631
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:46,144
We got a complaint, right, frank?
Come on.

632
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:48,393
All right, make it 200, keough.

633
00:52:48,563 --> 00:52:51,302
Hey, what are you, getting cheap
in your old age, bambino?

634
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,969
Three. Trollo: Three?

635
00:52:54,147 --> 00:52:55,851
Keough: You heard me.

636
00:52:56,897 --> 00:53:00,260
- All right, 3.
- I'll tell you what. I'll make it light.

637
00:53:01,897 --> 00:53:03,351
Hey, frank. Serpico: Yeah

638
00:53:03,522 --> 00:53:05,227
you wanna write this up?

639
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:06,932
Serpico: No, I'm gonna check in.

640
00:53:07,106 --> 00:53:08,844
Take the collar. Get on the sheet.

641
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,351
I better check in.

642
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:11,852
Keough: Hey, frank.

643
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:15,594
We gotta have a little talk later,
right?

644
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:23,302
That dumb schmuck only came up
with 2 bills because I booked him.

645
00:53:25,106 --> 00:53:26,765
Here you go, frank.

646
00:53:26,939 --> 00:53:29,222
Serpico:
No, it was your collar. Keep it.

647
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:33,260
I had a hunch
you weren't gonna take it.

648
00:53:34,563 --> 00:53:37,927
You know, Frankie, we got a call
about you from downtown.

649
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:39,514
Now, I ain't saying who.

650
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:42,722
They just said
you couldn't be trusted, you know.

651
00:53:43,438 --> 00:53:46,347
- Because I don't take money, right?
- Hey, frank.

652
00:53:46,563 --> 00:53:48,927
Face it. Who can trust a cop
who don't take money?

653
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:52,218
I mean, you are pretty weird,
you know, kid.

654
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:55,227
And with that call, the guys were
getting a little worried.

655
00:53:55,397 --> 00:53:58,102
I told them you're okay,
I knew you from the old 21.

656
00:53:58,271 --> 00:53:59,806
You'd never hurt another cop.

657
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,468
Right?

658
00:54:02,522 --> 00:54:04,852
You'd never hurt another cop,
would you, frank?

659
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:08,469
- That'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frankie.

660
00:54:09,939 --> 00:54:11,427
Frankie.

661
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:18,219
We're not doing anything bad here.
Skimming a little gambling money.

662
00:54:18,397 --> 00:54:20,181
It's clean. It's not dope.

663
00:54:20,355 --> 00:54:21,844
It hurts nobody.

664
00:54:22,064 --> 00:54:23,768
Frank.

665
00:54:23,939 --> 00:54:27,223
A gambler is a gentleman.
They're gonna operate anyhow, right?

666
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:31,222
You don't have to explain yourself.
You do what you gotta do.

667
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:33,556
- Want some tea?
- No, I don't like that shit.

668
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,434
How about coffee, huh?

669
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:38,760
What's the matter, frank?
What are you worried about?

670
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:41,969
Listen, we don't go overboard here.

671
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:45,727
We're not sloppy, we're careful.
The spics, the niggers, we bust them.

672
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:47,643
They operate so dumb and sloppy.

673
00:54:47,814 --> 00:54:49,768
They get your ass in hot water.

674
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,389
But the Italians,
now, that's a different story.

675
00:54:52,563 --> 00:54:55,552
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.

676
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:00,469
- Really got it analyzed, huh.
- You're fucking right I got it analyzed.

677
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,719
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

678
00:55:06,438 --> 00:55:10,268
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- Eight hundred dollars a month.

679
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:13,848
That's 800 clams every time
your girlfriend gets the curse.

680
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,635
Tax free.

681
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:18,803
Now, here's the beauty.
You don't get it the first eight weeks.

682
00:55:19,022 --> 00:55:21,385
Till the guys get to know you,
and you're okay.

683
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:23,097
But you don't lose either.

684
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:26,726
Because you get it on the other end
when you leave the division.

685
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:30,636
Frankie, it's like severance pay.

686
00:55:31,438 --> 00:55:34,927
Think it over, all right? In or out.

687
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,810
Look at me. Shaking.

688
00:55:44,397 --> 00:55:49,682
All my life I wanted to be a cop.
It's like I can remember nothing else.

689
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:54,810
I remember this one time.

690
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,765
There was, uh...

691
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:00,552
Something happened.
A domestic argument or something.

692
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,810
Somebody stabbed somebody.

693
00:56:03,688 --> 00:56:05,347
And.

694
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:09,469
There was this crowd
around this tenement.

695
00:56:09,772 --> 00:56:13,056
I must've been 9, 10 years old.
I was this big.

696
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,310
I went over to see what was going on.
I noticed a red light...

697
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,434
Going around and around.

698
00:56:18,605 --> 00:56:21,218
All these people, and I couldn't see.

699
00:56:22,063 --> 00:56:23,393
And I kept saying:

700
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:25,426
"You know what's going on?
Do you know?"

701
00:56:25,605 --> 00:56:27,343
Nobody knew.

702
00:56:27,772 --> 00:56:30,636
And it was, like,
the big mystery behind that...

703
00:56:31,063 --> 00:56:33,052
That crowd there.

704
00:56:33,772 --> 00:56:35,510
All of a sudden _.

705
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:38,051
The crowd just parted.

706
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:44,302
And there were these guys in blue.
And I said:

707
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,469
"They know."

708
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:50,393
What do they know?
What do they know?

709
00:56:55,563 --> 00:56:57,552
It's amazing.

710
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,844
It's incredible.

711
00:57:00,897 --> 00:57:03,727
But I feel like a criminal
because I don't take money.

712
00:57:08,063 --> 00:57:10,347
You get so tense
when you talk about it.

713
00:57:10,522 --> 00:57:13,556
- I wonder why.
- Come here.

714
00:57:17,897 --> 00:57:19,601
Right there. Here?

715
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:20,931
Uh-huh.

716
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,677
- I'm gonna ask you a question, okay?
- Okay.

717
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:26,935
Do you like cops?

718
00:57:27,105 --> 00:57:29,014
You're my first.

719
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,013
No, I mean,
all this shit I've been telling you.

720
00:57:33,188 --> 00:57:35,972
- Do you believe it?
- Why not?

721
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,014
- Does it shock you?
- Not much

722
00:57:40,814 --> 00:57:43,348
what's the matter with me?

723
00:57:43,522 --> 00:57:46,181
Everybody knows about cops.

724
00:57:46,688 --> 00:57:49,347
Did you ever hear
the story the wise king?

725
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:52,010
No. But I got the feeling
I'm gonna hear it.

726
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:57,594
Well, there was this king,
and he ruled over his kingdom.

727
00:57:57,772 --> 00:57:59,886
- Yeah.
- Right in the middle of the kingdom...

728
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,223
There was a well.
That's where everybody drank.

729
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,056
- Mm-hm.
- One night...

730
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,310
This witch came along.

731
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,844
And she poisoned the well.

732
00:58:09,021 --> 00:58:10,055
Ah

733
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,435
And the next day, everybody
drank from it except the king.

734
00:58:13,605 --> 00:58:15,639
And they all went crazy.

735
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:17,972
They got together in the street
and they said:

736
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:21,226
"We gotta get rid of the king
because the king is mad."

737
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,218
Serpico: Uh-oh. - Ha, ha.

738
00:58:23,397 --> 00:58:26,761
And then that night, he went down
and he drank from the well

739
00:58:26,979 --> 00:58:29,559
and the next day
all the people rejoiced...

740
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:33,184
Because their king had regained
his reason.

741
00:58:38,105 --> 00:58:40,094
You're trying to tell me something.
Me?

742
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:41,385
Yeah

743
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,639
keough: Frank, say hello to somebody.
Hey, grab your cocks and grab your socks.

744
00:58:47,814 --> 00:58:50,223
- What the fuck is this?
Keough: Ha, ha.

745
00:58:51,563 --> 00:58:54,176
Frank serpico.
Say hello to Don rubello.

746
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:56,218
He's gonna be your new partner.

747
00:58:57,979 --> 00:59:01,844
Look, if you don't wanna work with
this fucking nut for some reason...

748
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:03,930
I'll buddy up with him, all right?

749
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:07,972
And go through all that crap
changing assignments? No, no.

750
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:11,431
We'll be okay. We're paisanos, eh”?

751
00:59:14,188 --> 00:59:16,518
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- He's my partner.

752
00:59:17,063 --> 00:59:18,742
- Partner?
Serpico: He's specially trained.

753
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:21,013
He goes to track down heroin.

754
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:25,301
Let him loose.
He goes into the hole, brings it back...

755
00:59:25,522 --> 00:59:28,056
Sniffs it out, brings it to you.

756
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:31,476
Yeah, I heard of that.

757
00:59:31,647 --> 00:59:33,351
- You heard of that?
Rubello: Yeah

758
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:38,601
this guy I'm looking for, Vernon.

759
00:59:39,146 --> 00:59:42,851
He's a numbers collector
who ain't been meeting his obligations.

760
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:48,052
He won't be hard to spot.
He's a mover. This is prime time.

761
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:54,093
Since we're partners,
you gotta know the situation.

762
00:59:54,438 --> 00:59:56,097
Straight off.

763
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:58,601
I collect for the division.

764
00:59:58,772 --> 01:00:00,681
Me and two other bagmen.

765
01:00:00,854 --> 01:00:03,468
That's what keough
was sort of hinting at.

766
01:00:05,563 --> 01:00:08,847
Yeah, the three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

767
01:00:09,896 --> 01:00:13,056
Hey. Look, there he is.

768
01:00:24,438 --> 01:00:26,643
Son of a bitch!

769
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:32,726
Look out! Oh, my god!

770
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,225
Rubello: Where's the money?

771
01:01:57,563 --> 01:01:59,892
You been jerking me around, you fuck. Huh?

772
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:02,889
Vernon:
I know I'm behind now, man.

773
01:02:06,397 --> 01:02:08,306
Three times
you never show, right?

774
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:09,885
I'll have it for you tonight.

775
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:13,097
I swear. I'll have it for you tonight.
Don't bust me.

776
01:02:16,105 --> 01:02:19,139
Rubello:
The last time, Vernon. The last time.

777
01:02:19,355 --> 01:02:23,264
You fuck me and you're gone,
you hear? You hear, huh? Huh?

778
01:02:24,647 --> 01:02:26,556
See you at the domino. Midnight.

779
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:29,809
And you better have $300, you fuck.
You hear? Right?

780
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,559
Right?

781
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:35,808
All right, frank.

782
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:41,847
Huh? Huh? Heh.

783
01:02:42,021 --> 01:02:44,431
I keep this place for socializing.

784
01:02:44,647 --> 01:02:48,352
Someday I'll get a couple
of broads, huh? Have a little party.

785
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:57,310
Make some ice.
Booze is right over here.

786
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,347
Look, Don.

787
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:10,886
If I was broke, if I had a family,
I don't know.

788
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:13,177
But I'm not broke,
and I don't have a family.

789
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:15,344
Why stick my neck out,
know what I mean?

790
01:03:15,522 --> 01:03:18,635
It's already out, frank,
not taking the money.

791
01:03:18,854 --> 01:03:20,683
Better the other guys
don't know that

792
01:03:20,854 --> 01:03:22,888
hey, I tell you what I'll do.

793
01:03:24,188 --> 01:03:25,892
I'll hold your share for you, huh?

794
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:28,847
You change your mind,
it'll be right in here.

795
01:03:29,021 --> 01:03:32,226
Right in here.
Right down to the penny, huh?

796
01:03:32,397 --> 01:03:33,726
I ook at that.

797
01:03:34,188 --> 01:03:37,177
- What are you drinking?
- Give me a scotch.

798
01:03:40,063 --> 01:03:42,972
Next thing I wanna do, get a color TV,
you know, for the games.

799
01:03:43,146 --> 01:03:46,680
Heh. Hey, how about some gin,
penny a point?

800
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:16,968
Mcclain: Hello, frank. Get in.

801
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:26,885
My god, frank.
This is confidential.

802
01:04:28,313 --> 01:04:29,642
He's a police officer.

803
01:04:29,813 --> 01:04:32,802
- I thought maybe he could sit in.
- No, absolutely not.

804
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:35,142
All right, all right.

805
01:04:36,313 --> 01:04:40,768
Frank, I notified commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

806
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:43,097
He wants you to stay
right where you are...

807
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:47,885
And continue to collect information.
Then you'll be his eyes and his ears.

808
01:04:48,063 --> 01:04:50,347
He said he was delighted that, quote:

809
01:04:50,522 --> 01:04:54,056
"A man of integrity had surfaced,”
unquote.

810
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,764
When do I hear from him?

811
01:04:57,979 --> 01:05:01,013
Well, he said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

812
01:05:03,355 --> 01:05:05,309
- "Reach out"?
- Mm-hm_

813
01:05:06,813 --> 01:05:09,643
See, my situation's
pretty fucking sticky up there.

814
01:05:09,813 --> 01:05:13,098
- What am I supposed to do? Wait?
- You must have Patience, frank.

815
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:16,010
- Yeah, but it's pretty fucking St...
- Patience and faith.

816
01:05:16,188 --> 01:05:19,517
When a man like the commissioner
says he'll get in touch with you...

817
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:21,550
He'll get in touch with you.

818
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:25,142
Goodbye, son. God bless you.

819
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:41,680
Keough: All right, now.

820
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:45,309
Marinda's too hot. We gotta
lay off him for a couple of months.

821
01:05:45,479 --> 01:05:47,968
And Falco's got two runners
he ain't paying for.

822
01:05:48,146 --> 01:05:51,726
Check that fucking guy out, huh?
Hey, Frankie, how are you?

823
01:05:51,896 --> 01:05:55,931
Listen, rubello's being transferred.
You'll have to work with a new bagman.

824
01:05:56,105 --> 01:05:59,764
Al Sarno, I want you to meet frank
serpico. This will be your new man.

825
01:05:59,979 --> 01:06:01,309
Sarno: Hi. Serpico: Hi

826
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:04,310
you know that operation down
by hunt's point, the new one?

827
01:06:04,479 --> 01:06:06,718
What are we gonna do?
Who do we give it to?

828
01:06:06,938 --> 01:06:09,097
Boy:
You the new bagman, you prick?

829
01:06:09,271 --> 01:06:12,010
What happened to rubello,
you son of a bitch?

830
01:06:12,188 --> 01:06:15,302
- You mother...
Sarno: Wait a minute.

831
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,434
You know, frank,
sometimes I ask myself:

832
01:06:30,646 --> 01:06:32,976
"What the fuck am I doing?”

833
01:06:34,562 --> 01:06:36,926
You know, if this ever came out...

834
01:06:37,313 --> 01:06:39,393
Christ, my family...

835
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:43,135
My daughter.

836
01:06:43,854 --> 01:06:46,138
She just started
with the San Francisco opera.

837
01:06:46,604 --> 01:06:48,264
Chorus.

838
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:50,718
Took a lot of money.

839
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:54,509
I once tried to pull out.

840
01:06:54,687 --> 01:06:56,846
Christ, they were all over me.

841
01:06:57,021 --> 01:06:58,634
So you...

842
01:06:59,105 --> 01:07:00,968
Just go along.

843
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,475
Unless you're willing
to go back to uniform duty.

844
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:28,143
Shit. How the money rolls in.

845
01:07:28,896 --> 01:07:32,510
- Here. Let me give you yours now.
- No, I'm not on.

846
01:07:33,313 --> 01:07:38,223
- What do you mean, you're not on?
- I'm not on, I don't take money.

847
01:07:38,396 --> 01:07:41,056
- Some gag. Here.
- No, I told you straight.

848
01:07:41,938 --> 01:07:44,348
I don't take money. That's the truth.

849
01:07:53,105 --> 01:07:54,684
Your nut.

850
01:07:54,854 --> 01:07:58,468
Where's it been going?
Ask rubello.

851
01:07:59,354 --> 01:08:02,122
Serpico: All right, then, sir.
I'll go to Delaney myself, then.

852
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:03,930
That would not be advisable, frank.

853
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:07,430
You don't understand, captain.
You see, it's been weeks, not a word.

854
01:08:07,604 --> 01:08:09,309
Mcclain:
I understand perfectly, frank.

855
01:08:09,479 --> 01:08:13,264
- No, but... now they know I'm not on.
- I've done all I can do.

856
01:08:13,479 --> 01:08:15,139
Goodbye, frank.

857
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:21,388
He's out

858
01:08:21,562 --> 01:08:23,642
won't do another fucking thing.

859
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,343
Blair, I'm telling you, nothing's
gonna happen from the inside.

860
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:30,101
The top guys have been cops
too long.

861
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:35,851
- You haven't heard from Delaney?
- No, not a fucking word.

862
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:44,976
Are you willing to go
outside the department?

863
01:08:45,146 --> 01:08:46,805
Where could we go?

864
01:08:48,105 --> 01:08:50,809
Would you believe
the mayor's office?

865
01:08:58,854 --> 01:09:01,184
- The mayor's office”?
- His right-hand man.

866
01:09:01,396 --> 01:09:03,760
A guy named Jerry berman
from Princeton.

867
01:09:03,938 --> 01:09:06,517
You knew I know somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

868
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,676
And he cares, frank.
He really cares.

869
01:09:13,188 --> 01:09:15,301
You know what we're doing? Yeah

870
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:18,684
- we're going outside the department.
- That's right.

871
01:09:23,021 --> 01:09:26,384
Dynamite. Every plainclothes man
in the division.

872
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,721
And one, maybe two, lieutenants?

873
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:31,350
Heh. That's... that is dynamite.

874
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:33,010
That is incredible.

875
01:09:33,312 --> 01:09:36,426
That is 150...

876
01:09:36,604 --> 01:09:42,434
That is $250,000 a year,
but that is just one precinct.

877
01:09:43,146 --> 01:09:45,475
That is amazing.

878
01:09:46,604 --> 01:09:50,309
See, what I feel is needed here is,
you know, like, a real investigation.

879
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:54,139
Berman: And I am sure that the mayor
will see this immediately.

880
01:09:54,312 --> 01:09:58,677
Mcclain and Delaney,
they have done nothing?

881
01:09:58,854 --> 01:10:00,763
Oh, man, that is amazing.

882
01:10:04,063 --> 01:10:05,801
Another... another thing, see...

883
01:10:05,979 --> 01:10:10,217
In a couple of days, they're
gonna have a meeting of the pad.

884
01:10:10,396 --> 01:10:12,851
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that.

885
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:17,225
Rumors. See, I have heard rumors.
But never touching it directly.

886
01:10:17,396 --> 01:10:23,011
And for an on-the-line cop
to come forward like this is beautiful.

887
01:10:23,188 --> 01:10:26,722
Really, frank, I mean,
you have my respect...

888
01:10:26,896 --> 01:10:31,056
And my sympathy for what you've
been going through, man. Wow.

889
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:40,263
Hello, this is Jerry berman.
Is he there?

890
01:10:40,854 --> 01:10:43,093
All right, I'll hold on.

891
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,592
Well?

892
01:11:01,938 --> 01:11:03,767
Tell me what happened, paco.

893
01:11:03,938 --> 01:11:06,472
I'd like a drink.

894
01:11:11,437 --> 01:11:14,301
That guy's gonna go to the mayor.

895
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:21,093
- To the mayor.
- Ha, ha.

896
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:27,889
Come here, Alfie. We're all gonna go
to the mayor together, you know that?

897
01:11:31,479 --> 01:11:34,718
I couldn't be any more embarrassed.

898
01:11:35,354 --> 01:11:38,218
It's like a personal defeat.

899
01:11:39,063 --> 01:11:41,142
However.

900
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:43,346
There are priorities.

901
01:11:43,521 --> 01:11:45,851
What are the priorities, Jerry?

902
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:50,510
The priorities are a long,
hot summer ahead

903
01:11:50,687 --> 01:11:53,300
and riots are expected.

904
01:11:54,396 --> 01:11:58,305
And the mayor cannot
alienate the police force.

905
01:11:58,604 --> 01:12:00,934
Now, in the fall...

906
01:12:01,104 --> 01:12:06,184
Now, in the fall, it may be possible
to take another look at the situation.

907
01:12:06,354 --> 01:12:08,217
All right, all right. I'm sorry.

908
01:12:09,312 --> 01:12:10,972
Frank.

909
01:12:22,521 --> 01:12:24,056
Serpico: All rotten

910
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:25,934
chickenshit.

911
01:12:26,104 --> 01:12:28,639
The whole fucking system's corrupt.

912
01:12:33,021 --> 01:12:36,555
- Who's there?
Blair: It's me, frank, I gotta talk to you.

913
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:42,431
You know, frank, you're behaving like
a goddamn child, do you hear?

914
01:12:42,854 --> 01:12:44,888
Let him in.

915
01:12:46,521 --> 01:12:48,555
You let him in.

916
01:12:57,562 --> 01:13:00,221
Laurie: Hi. - Hello.

917
01:13:07,145 --> 01:13:10,010
I'm sorry, frank, I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

918
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:13,347
Bullshit. I got me
into this whole thing.

919
01:13:14,396 --> 01:13:19,306
"Wow," "amazing,"
"dynamite," "beautiful."

920
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:22,639
"Dynamite." "priorities, priorities."

921
01:13:22,813 --> 01:13:24,893
You and your big-deal friends.

922
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:28,010
Your contacts,
your big bullshit names.

923
01:13:28,187 --> 01:13:31,096
Bob Blair, the big operator
from Princeton. Huh?

924
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:34,100
The mystery man with connections,
the line to the mayor.

925
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:36,384
Who do you think you are,
you son of a bitch?

926
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:39,676
You come looking for help, whining,
with your humble-pie act...

927
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:41,513
The Saint, the injured innocent.

928
01:13:41,687 --> 01:13:45,972
Who told you the department or the
whole world was a boy scout camp?

929
01:13:47,646 --> 01:13:50,476
What do you expect,
for chrissake? A magician?

930
01:13:50,646 --> 01:13:54,510
A big daddy? White knight rides
in on a horse, snaps his fingers...

931
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,892
- You keep talking.
- The world turns white.

932
01:13:57,062 --> 01:13:59,722
While the pope's choir sings
"ave Maria"? Is that it?

933
01:13:59,896 --> 01:14:01,179
I tried to help you.

934
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:04,684
You're gonna blame me because those
bastards don't wanna get involved?

935
01:14:04,854 --> 01:14:07,718
- I got my head handed to me.
- Where's your head?

936
01:14:07,896 --> 01:14:10,475
On your shoulders, I see.
You don't look so hot.

937
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,384
What's all this shit over here?

938
01:14:12,562 --> 01:14:14,926
Get ready to blow up again.
I got another idea.

939
01:14:15,104 --> 01:14:17,593
You and your ideas
are as full of shit as you are.

940
01:14:18,062 --> 01:14:19,461
Blair: Right on cue.
- Right on cue.

941
01:14:19,562 --> 01:14:22,471
We could talk to foreman,
the commissioner of investigations.

942
01:14:22,646 --> 01:14:24,555
Another guy.
We got another guy here.

943
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:28,092
We could even talk to a guy I know
on the the New York times.

944
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,930
Oh, that's terrific.

945
01:14:30,104 --> 01:14:31,718
(So to the times.

946
01:14:31,896 --> 01:14:35,555
Every time I talk to you, Blair, 20 more
people know about it, you know that?

947
01:14:35,729 --> 01:14:37,217
Frank, it's safe. “It's safe?

948
01:14:37,396 --> 01:14:40,601
- My ass on the line, it's safe?
- Your ass is already on the line.

949
01:14:40,771 --> 01:14:43,510
That's my business, all right?
You don't trust me?

950
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,471
- I don't trust you.
- Go fuck yourself.

951
01:14:45,646 --> 01:14:46,680
Fuck you.

952
01:14:50,813 --> 01:14:52,926
Look, when I come home,
I want a house clean.

953
01:14:53,104 --> 01:14:57,685
- Don't take it out on me, paco.
- I'm not. I don't wanna pick up shit.

954
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:39,217
Honey?

955
01:15:39,854 --> 01:15:41,513
Come to bed.

956
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:46,259
- Hello, frank.
- Hey, frank.

957
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:52,180
All right, we all know
what this is about, right?

958
01:16:52,354 --> 01:16:55,058
So without any bullshit,
frank, what was happening...

959
01:16:55,229 --> 01:16:57,468
Between you and Don rubello?

960
01:16:59,145 --> 01:17:02,884
Simple. I didn't take any money,
I don't take money.

961
01:17:03,062 --> 01:17:07,892
Rubello said if I changed
my mind, he would hold my share.

962
01:17:08,312 --> 01:17:10,392
Uh, he'd give it back to me.

963
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:13,388
- I didn't change my mind.
- Conniving bastard.

964
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:16,800
All right, look, I'll handle rubello.

965
01:17:16,978 --> 01:17:20,684
I'll get back the money he took.
But this ain't gonna happen again.

966
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:22,842
From now on, no more three bagmen.

967
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:26,350
Starting today, every one of you fucks
makes his own collections.

968
01:17:26,521 --> 01:17:29,601
- No stops, no bread. Okay?
- Okay.

969
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,430
- Right.
- You got it.

970
01:17:31,604 --> 01:17:35,218
What about you, frank?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

971
01:17:35,687 --> 01:17:37,596
Why should I start now?

972
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:40,054
Everybody would feel a lot better
about you.

973
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:42,218
You can always give it
to charity, frank.

974
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:46,808
Look, frank. What do you say,
100 a month just for expenses?

975
01:17:47,812 --> 01:17:51,427
For my secretary and my
business lunches, entertainment?

976
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:56,842
All right, all right.

977
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,179
We split frank's share from now on.

978
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:01,559
You're a schmuck, frank.

979
01:18:09,812 --> 01:18:13,643
If they would take all that energy, see,
and put it into straight police work...

980
01:18:13,812 --> 01:18:18,097
We'd have the city cleaned in a week.
It'd be cleaned up, there'd be no crime.

981
01:18:24,646 --> 01:18:27,430
If I could work alone,
that's the thing, see.

982
01:18:27,604 --> 01:18:29,513
If I could just get... work alone.

983
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:31,720
They don't like that.
They don't want that.

984
01:18:31,895 --> 01:18:34,975
- They wanna suck you in.
Laurie: You go over the same thing, paco.

985
01:18:35,145 --> 01:18:38,305
They're so fucking corrupt.
Everybody, everyone.

986
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:41,309
Nobody giving a shit.
There's gotta be a way to wipe it out.

987
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:44,808
- Goddamn it, there's gotta be a way.
- Let's get out for a while, huh?

988
01:18:44,978 --> 01:18:46,841
- Let's go to a movie.
- Quit handling me.

989
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,850
What are you doing? Go to a movie.
How am I gonna go?

990
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:52,009
You know they'd kill me
if they knew?

991
01:18:52,187 --> 01:18:56,552
- You think that hasn't happened?
- Either you're exploding or catatonic.

992
01:18:56,728 --> 01:19:00,092
- I can't stand it, paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

993
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,509
All I care about is you.
That's all that matters to me.

994
01:19:03,686 --> 01:19:07,016
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this.

995
01:19:07,187 --> 01:19:10,846
Scared, miserable,
dreading to go to work.

996
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,384
It's tearing me apart.

997
01:19:12,562 --> 01:19:16,426
And then I get sick of hearing
about it, and I start hating myself.

998
01:19:16,937 --> 01:19:20,392
You didn't like my being a cop,
so don't give me that. You never did.

999
01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:22,925
I love you, paco.

1000
01:19:23,104 --> 01:19:25,843
I wanna marry you.
I wanna have children with you.

1001
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,555
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- If you hate it so much...

1002
01:19:28,728 --> 01:19:31,388
- Why don't you get out.
- Why don't you!

1003
01:19:31,562 --> 01:19:35,971
- It's crossed my mind.
- Well, do it.

1004
01:19:49,604 --> 01:19:51,217
What do you got?

1005
01:19:51,396 --> 01:19:55,510
- Would you bust whitey?
- Try me. Try me.

1006
01:19:56,145 --> 01:19:57,758
This guy's heavy.

1007
01:19:57,937 --> 01:20:01,017
He's Italian. Mobbed up.

1008
01:20:01,978 --> 01:20:03,967
- Still interested?
- Stop fucking around.

1009
01:20:04,145 --> 01:20:05,849
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

1010
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:10,225
He's a loan shark.
Runs a big numbers operation.

1011
01:20:10,604 --> 01:20:12,967
This mother's so cocksure

1012
01:20:13,145 --> 01:20:16,884
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

1013
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,096
Where's the drop?

1014
01:21:05,312 --> 01:21:06,675
Serpico: Hold it.

1015
01:21:07,104 --> 01:21:09,013
I'm a police officer.

1016
01:21:12,853 --> 01:21:14,513
Wait a minute.

1017
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:17,138
You're under arrest.

1018
01:21:17,354 --> 01:21:21,389
- Hell, I thought you was some junkie.
- Yeah, I'll take that wad in your pocket.

1019
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:25,725
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know, I'm a joke. What do you got?

1020
01:21:25,895 --> 01:21:27,633
What's that?

1021
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,430
Put that away, or you're in more
trouble. Give me the keys to your car.

1022
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:38,929
Where they been hiding you, kid?

1023
01:21:39,104 --> 01:21:41,218
Wouldn't you like to know?

1024
01:21:43,645 --> 01:21:46,055
Hold this guy for booking.
Get a rap sheet on him.

1025
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:47,967
I'm gonna search his car.

1026
01:22:11,312 --> 01:22:12,891
Where's corsaro?

1027
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:15,472
Man: Smith took him upstairs.

1028
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,304
I swear to god I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie.

1029
01:22:29,396 --> 01:22:32,260
Keough: You know, listen, Rudy,
you should see some of the...

1030
01:22:42,937 --> 01:22:44,675
Hey, you.

1031
01:22:44,853 --> 01:22:47,183
Hey, who? You.

1032
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:51,134
- Get over here and empty your pockets.
- I don't do that.

1033
01:22:51,312 --> 01:22:54,051
You're my prisoner, you do
what I tell you. Get over here.

1034
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:57,683
- He's gonna get nasty about it.
- You're fucking right.

1035
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:00,304
Keough: Frank, cool it, huh?

1036
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:03,637
Don't play me, motherfucker.
Spread.

1037
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,222
Frank. Hey, frank.
Rudy's on, he's good people.

1038
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:08,759
Stay the fuck out of this!

1039
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,724
What's this? What's this?

1040
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:07,717
Man: Serpico.

1041
01:24:07,895 --> 01:24:10,599
(Got that record check on corsaro.

1042
01:24:24,603 --> 01:24:26,592
Wanna read something?

1043
01:24:28,853 --> 01:24:31,137
It's about your pal corsaro.

1044
01:24:31,312 --> 01:24:35,096
Here, read it. Read it.

1045
01:24:37,187 --> 01:24:39,345
He did 15 years. You know what for?

1046
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,009
For killing a cop.
He's a fucking cop-killer.

1047
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,850
Mcclain: Good to see you.
- I've had it. I'm finished

1048
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:59,383
- what's wrong?
- I can't take it, I gotta get out.

1049
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,096
If I have to go back to uniform,
I'm going back.

1050
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:04,804
I can't wait for Delaney,
and I can't play their game.

1051
01:25:04,978 --> 01:25:08,012
- I'm right in the middle.
- The commissioner didn't get in touch?

1052
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:11,675
No, he didn't get in touch with me.
No investigation, no undercover work.

1053
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:13,183
I had no idea, frank.

1054
01:25:13,353 --> 01:25:17,184
Well, captain, I think it's only fair to
tell you I've been to outside agencies.

1055
01:25:17,353 --> 01:25:20,592
- I'm gonna go to more if I have to.
- What outside agencies?

1056
01:25:20,895 --> 01:25:22,758
Holy mother of god.

1057
01:25:22,937 --> 01:25:25,017
Frank, we wash
our own laundry around here.

1058
01:25:25,187 --> 01:25:27,516
- You could be charged for this.
- I thought so...

1059
01:25:27,686 --> 01:25:31,345
- But we do not wash our own laundry.
- You are in trouble, serpico.

1060
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,475
I don't care. I don't care
who gets it, including myself.

1061
01:25:34,645 --> 01:25:38,429
- If I have to go to outside agencies...
- You stay away from outside agencies.

1062
01:25:38,603 --> 01:25:40,217
- Where am I gonna go?
- Stay away.

1063
01:25:40,395 --> 01:25:42,805
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait until you hear from me.

1064
01:25:42,978 --> 01:25:44,716
- Been waiting.
- I'll get back to you.

1065
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:46,613
Serpico: That's not enough.
- I'll get back.

1066
01:25:46,728 --> 01:25:48,263
Serpico: Where am I gonna go?

1067
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:52,925
It's my life, you fuck!

1068
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,975
Strasser: Serpico.

1069
01:25:56,145 --> 01:25:58,849
See inspector Palmer.

1070
01:26:06,104 --> 01:26:08,513
Palmer: For this precinct,
cases reported of murder...

1071
01:26:08,686 --> 01:26:13,550
14 for August,
20 for September, 20 for...

1072
01:26:13,728 --> 01:26:15,762
Serpico.

1073
01:26:16,269 --> 01:26:18,303
Serpico: Inspector Palmer?

1074
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,509
Deputy chief inspector daley
and inspector Gilbert...

1075
01:26:23,686 --> 01:26:25,970
Are waiting to see you.

1076
01:26:28,853 --> 01:26:31,262
You wanna come to my office.

1077
01:26:37,686 --> 01:26:39,515
Captain mcclain called me.

1078
01:26:39,853 --> 01:26:44,183
I briefed inspector daley and
inspector Gilbert on your allegations.

1079
01:26:44,561 --> 01:26:47,800
Now, the obvious question is this:
In all these months

1080
01:26:47,978 --> 01:26:50,387
why didn't you come to us?

1081
01:26:51,728 --> 01:26:53,387
Well

1082
01:26:54,104 --> 01:26:55,138
uh

1083
01:26:55,937 --> 01:26:59,176
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir.

1084
01:26:59,478 --> 01:27:01,558
Uh, you told...

1085
01:27:01,728 --> 01:27:03,307
I mean, you... you...

1086
01:27:03,478 --> 01:27:07,059
You told captain mcclain that the
division was clean as a hound's tooth

1087
01:27:07,228 --> 01:27:10,683
you think you're the only honest cop
on the force, serpico?

1088
01:27:10,853 --> 01:27:12,591
My record's clear.

1089
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:15,180
Inspector Gilbert's come
from the commissioner's.

1090
01:27:15,353 --> 01:27:17,683
Confidential investigation unit.

1091
01:27:18,269 --> 01:27:20,929
Well, then you must
have heard something.

1092
01:27:23,269 --> 01:27:24,678
I don't understand.

1093
01:27:24,853 --> 01:27:28,013
Commissioner Delaney has known
about this from the beginning.

1094
01:27:29,728 --> 01:27:32,092
I didn't hear a thing.

1095
01:27:32,478 --> 01:27:37,308
But, uh, I understand your frustration,
frank, believe me. Heh.

1096
01:27:37,895 --> 01:27:43,259
I mean, it's, uh, sort of like trying to
punch your way out of a paper bag, right?

1097
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:49,846
What outside agencies
have you been to, frank?

1098
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:59,429
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

1099
01:28:00,978 --> 01:28:04,432
I think we ought to ask serpico
directly if he's gonna cooperate or not.

1100
01:28:04,603 --> 01:28:06,387
- Come on, George.
- We've gotta know...

1101
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:10,391
If there's any real basis
for an investigation.

1102
01:28:11,603 --> 01:28:15,183
Well, I... I'll have to think that...

1103
01:28:15,812 --> 01:28:17,766
I'll have to think about that.

1104
01:28:18,436 --> 01:28:20,675
Daley:
What is there to think about?

1105
01:28:21,686 --> 01:28:25,470
I don't see how the division
can investigate itself.

1106
01:28:26,311 --> 01:28:28,550
You got a point there.

1107
01:28:29,395 --> 01:28:33,851
But you would cooperate
with an impartial investigation, right?

1108
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:38,683
Yeah. Up to a point.

1109
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:41,013
As long as I'm not involved.

1110
01:28:42,436 --> 01:28:45,721
I just wanna go someplace
where I can do my job.

1111
01:28:46,144 --> 01:28:48,178
That's fair enough.

1112
01:28:48,728 --> 01:28:50,762
We'll be in touch.

1113
01:28:54,895 --> 01:28:58,930
Serpico: Inspector Palmer,
can I see you a minute?

1114
01:29:04,436 --> 01:29:09,425
Was it necessary to let everyone know
I was coming here to see these guys?

1115
01:29:09,603 --> 01:29:13,342
You believe that a full-scale
investigation is warranted?

1116
01:29:14,228 --> 01:29:16,137
Daley:
Yes, commissioner Delaney.

1117
01:29:16,311 --> 01:29:18,016
Goto it

1118
01:29:21,144 --> 01:29:23,224
but, sir...

1119
01:29:23,395 --> 01:29:26,850
Shouldn't headquarters
handle something like this?

1120
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,599
No

1121
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:31,224
You're all experienced men.

1122
01:29:32,978 --> 01:29:36,592
Chief Gallagher here will be
available for consultation.

1123
01:29:41,144 --> 01:29:43,349
Commissioner, uh...

1124
01:29:45,353 --> 01:29:48,433
Serpico claims that, uh...

1125
01:29:48,937 --> 01:29:52,391
Inspector mcclain talked to you
about this whole thing some time ago.

1126
01:29:52,561 --> 01:29:54,220
Yes

1127
01:29:54,686 --> 01:29:57,345
I seem to remember
something about that.

1128
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:05,559
We can't set up a surveillance on
somewhere over by crotona park.

1129
01:30:05,728 --> 01:30:07,591
We need a location.

1130
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:10,554
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off.

1131
01:30:10,728 --> 01:30:14,182
Now, what do you want? The whole
thing signed, sealed, delivered?

1132
01:30:14,353 --> 01:30:16,467
You're conducting
this investigation, not me.

1133
01:30:16,645 --> 01:30:19,384
All right, frank. Lieutenant Smith.
Let's get back to him.

1134
01:30:19,561 --> 01:30:23,641
Lieutenant Smith.
I ieutenant Smith said to me

1135
01:30:23,812 --> 01:30:28,426
if I didn't want the money,
that he would stash it in his attic.

1136
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:32,683
- I'll have him transferred.
- Fuck him. How about transferring me?

1137
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:43,224
Burns: Serpico.

1138
01:30:45,228 --> 01:30:47,262
I hear you've been
vouchering pad money...

1139
01:30:47,436 --> 01:30:50,721
Over to a confidential
investigation squad.

1140
01:30:50,895 --> 01:30:52,633
Oh, yeah?

1141
01:30:52,812 --> 01:30:55,300
How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

1142
01:30:55,645 --> 01:30:57,679
Smith:
You won't find anything on serpico.

1143
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,258
He's clean.

1144
01:31:02,645 --> 01:31:04,179
Right?

1145
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:09,599
- Hmm?
- You practicing your frisk?

1146
01:31:10,645 --> 01:31:12,304
No

1147
01:31:12,561 --> 01:31:15,470
I'm looking to buy
a used tape recorder.

1148
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:20,558
Wear a wire?
They're feeling me up every day.

1149
01:31:20,728 --> 01:31:23,262
- How am I gonna wear a wire?
- Come on, frank.

1150
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:28,676
Look, wearing a wire means testifying
to corroborate the tape, right? Right.

1151
01:31:28,853 --> 01:31:31,182
I'm not testifying.

1152
01:31:31,812 --> 01:31:33,892
I gotta put a dime
in the parking meter.

1153
01:31:34,061 --> 01:31:38,096
Daley: Franklin, put a dime in the
parking meter for serpico.

1154
01:31:42,603 --> 01:31:43,887
Hey, frank.

1155
01:31:44,061 --> 01:31:47,221
Frank, uh, you know Herman tauber,
district attorney?

1156
01:31:47,812 --> 01:31:49,391
Yeah, I watch television.

1157
01:31:49,561 --> 01:31:53,550
Frank, I wanna compliment you
for coming forward like this.

1158
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:56,966
It's... it's unique.
It's uniquely unique.

1159
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:59,724
You should be proud of yourself.

1160
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:02,599
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shit heels

1161
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:05,850
with frank serpico
as my star witness.

1162
01:32:06,019 --> 01:32:09,634
Mr. tauber, you and everybody
in this room can go to hell...

1163
01:32:09,812 --> 01:32:12,095
Because I'm not testifying.
“Wait listen.

1164
01:32:12,269 --> 01:32:15,474
Wait, wait, wait. Just a second,
frank, you have nothing to fear.

1165
01:32:15,645 --> 01:32:18,509
- You're not gonna be singled out.
- I'm not afraid.

1166
01:32:18,686 --> 01:32:20,220
I don't give a fuck who knows...

1167
01:32:20,395 --> 01:32:24,100
If it meant something, but this
investigation is bullshit. It's bullshit.

1168
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:27,766
You're not after corruption in the
department, the division, the Bronx.

1169
01:32:27,936 --> 01:32:31,891
A few flunky cops thrown to the wolves
to protect Delaney and those guys...

1170
01:32:32,061 --> 01:32:36,141
Who known about this shit and won't
do a thing. That's why I won't testify.

1171
01:33:10,269 --> 01:33:11,882
Hey, what's this?

1172
01:33:12,269 --> 01:33:14,428
Exactly what it says.

1173
01:33:14,852 --> 01:33:18,592
- I'm splitting.
- I never read anything so stupid.

1174
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:21,849
"I'm leaving. If you wanna
discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."

1175
01:33:22,019 --> 01:33:24,303
I didn't feel like another
blood-and-guts scene.

1176
01:33:24,478 --> 01:33:26,512
I figured you wouldn't
be able to shout.

1177
01:33:26,686 --> 01:33:28,890
I can shout anywhere.

1178
01:33:33,395 --> 01:33:35,349
I won't shout.

1179
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:38,675
Sit down, sit down.

1180
01:33:51,811 --> 01:33:56,301
It's just gonna go on and on, paco.
It isn't gonna get any better.

1181
01:33:57,561 --> 01:34:01,220
And if you quit,
somehow I'll be blamed.

1182
01:34:09,603 --> 01:34:12,512
How could you leave
the man you love?

1183
01:34:12,811 --> 01:34:15,346
The future father of your kids?

1184
01:34:17,686 --> 01:34:20,924
You never said anything like that
to me before.

1185
01:34:22,019 --> 01:34:24,383
And if I come back.

1186
01:34:24,769 --> 01:34:27,304
You won't say it again.

1187
01:34:28,061 --> 01:34:31,346
You wanna be free and unattached

1188
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,054
10 go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

1189
01:34:35,228 --> 01:34:37,558
My "cause”...

1190
01:34:38,769 --> 01:34:41,179
Oh, paco.

1191
01:34:41,811 --> 01:34:43,516
I felt so safe with you...

1192
01:34:44,769 --> 01:34:46,633
So loving.

1193
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,974
Stay with me, Laurie.

1194
01:35:01,436 --> 01:35:04,391
- Come on, stay with me.
- Oh, no.

1195
01:35:14,769 --> 01:35:16,474
What am I doing?

1196
01:35:16,645 --> 01:35:19,758
I owe you for that, huh”? Here.

1197
01:35:20,269 --> 01:35:22,258
Here's $2.

1198
01:35:32,353 --> 01:35:34,012
I aurie.

1199
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:41,140
What are you doing?

1200
01:35:45,727 --> 01:35:48,341
Do you wanna walk away,
or should 1?

1201
01:35:49,186 --> 01:35:51,890
I'm not gonna walk away.

1202
01:35:53,186 --> 01:35:55,345
It's finished.

1203
01:36:02,228 --> 01:36:05,558
Who do you think you are, pulling
that "no testifying" bullshit on me?

1204
01:36:05,727 --> 01:36:09,182
Chief green, I know your reputation.

1205
01:36:09,353 --> 01:36:13,592
Look, maybe if you were borough
commander when this thing started...

1206
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:17,224
Run this investigation yourself,
I'd feel different about testifying.

1207
01:36:17,395 --> 01:36:19,634
The truth is,
you're coming in after the fact.

1208
01:36:19,811 --> 01:36:22,016
Cut the crap.
You're like a quiff who says...

1209
01:36:22,186 --> 01:36:24,015
She won't, she will,
then she won't.

1210
01:36:24,186 --> 01:36:27,674
Yeah, I'm like a quiff who's been
fucked over for a year and a half...

1211
01:36:27,852 --> 01:36:30,716
By guys like kellogg,
mcclain, Delaney.

1212
01:36:30,894 --> 01:36:36,304
- I'm not kellogg, mcclain or Delaney.
- Frank, it won't be just flunky cops.

1213
01:36:36,478 --> 01:36:38,137
This is only the beginning.

1214
01:36:38,311 --> 01:36:41,175
This could be the biggest thing
since the Harry gross case.

1215
01:36:41,353 --> 01:36:43,841
And meanwhile where am I?
I'm out there alone.

1216
01:36:44,019 --> 01:36:47,258
Who gives a fuck about that?
I'm totally isolated in the department.

1217
01:36:47,436 --> 01:36:49,516
- I don't have a friend.
- Don't give me that.

1218
01:36:49,685 --> 01:36:51,639
I've been putting cops away
for 30 years.

1219
01:36:51,811 --> 01:36:55,050
My name's an obscenity on
every shit-house wall in every precinct.

1220
01:36:55,228 --> 01:36:56,841
Serpico:
I've observed that, sir.

1221
01:36:57,019 --> 01:37:00,803
"Friends." I fought my way up as a Jew
in the days you're supposed to have...

1222
01:37:00,977 --> 01:37:03,307
An uncircumcised shamrock
between your legs.

1223
01:37:03,478 --> 01:37:07,137
I have this nightmare: I'm on fifth ave.,
watching St. Patrick's day parade.

1224
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:12,016
I have a coronary, and 9000 cops
march happily over my body. Friends.

1225
01:37:12,186 --> 01:37:13,924
I haven't got a friend in the force.

1226
01:37:14,103 --> 01:37:16,637
Serpico: I'll be your friend, chief.
- I'm not looking for any.

1227
01:37:16,811 --> 01:37:19,551
- I'll make an exception in your case.
Tauber: You're a good cop.

1228
01:37:19,727 --> 01:37:22,932
Stop being a prima Donna,
just cut out the shticklech.

1229
01:37:23,103 --> 01:37:26,183
I don't understand, you know.
How am I being a prima Donna?

1230
01:37:26,353 --> 01:37:29,183
- I wanna protect myself.
- Frank.

1231
01:37:29,353 --> 01:37:34,183
We're gonna get the indictments.
You're gonna have to testify.

1232
01:37:40,852 --> 01:37:44,512
Man: Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.

1233
01:37:44,685 --> 01:37:46,890
Ready on the firing line.

1234
01:38:36,936 --> 01:38:39,425
What are you gonna tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

1235
01:38:41,852 --> 01:38:43,636
Depends on what they ask me.

1236
01:38:43,811 --> 01:38:46,300
Suppose they ask you
who's taking money.

1237
01:38:46,478 --> 01:38:48,432
What I don't know, I don't know.

1238
01:38:48,602 --> 01:38:50,966
But you do know, frank.

1239
01:38:51,395 --> 01:38:55,350
Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't
wanna see anything happen to you.

1240
01:38:55,519 --> 01:38:59,429
But you gotta understand,
a lot of people could get hurt here.

1241
01:38:59,977 --> 01:39:03,341
Look, I'm not saying it's gonna happen.
I'm saying it could happen.

1242
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,300
There's lots of ways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.

1243
01:39:06,477 --> 01:39:08,682
They can just not be there
when you need them.

1244
01:39:08,852 --> 01:39:11,841
Somebody come at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

1245
01:39:12,019 --> 01:39:15,008
Or they can send you in first
enough times until one day...

1246
01:39:15,186 --> 01:39:17,595
You're gonna walk
in the wrong door.

1247
01:39:20,519 --> 01:39:23,054
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, frank.

1248
01:39:26,477 --> 01:39:29,433
I have nothing more. Does anyone
have any further questions?

1249
01:39:29,602 --> 01:39:30,921
Crist: Uh, yes.
- Yes, Mrs. crist?

1250
01:39:31,061 --> 01:39:32,640
If I may, Mr. Knowles. Thank you.

1251
01:39:32,811 --> 01:39:35,050
Officer serpico came
to the 7th division

1252
01:39:35,228 --> 01:39:36,887
more than a year and a half ago.

1253
01:39:37,061 --> 01:39:41,175
All during that time, the things
he's told us were taking place. Now...

1254
01:39:41,353 --> 01:39:45,717
Why didn't officer serpico report
these criminal activities long before...

1255
01:39:45,894 --> 01:39:48,553
- When he first encountered them?
- I'd like to answer.

1256
01:39:48,727 --> 01:39:51,932
Mr. chairman, uh,
Mrs. crist's question...

1257
01:39:52,103 --> 01:39:55,388
I don't believe is, uh, material
or relevant to the present inquiry.

1258
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,674
I'd like to answer that question, sir.

1259
01:39:57,852 --> 01:40:01,887
Officer serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way...

1260
01:40:02,061 --> 01:40:05,470
Or guilty of any infraction
of the law. Quite the contrary.

1261
01:40:05,644 --> 01:40:09,008
The district attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

1262
01:40:09,186 --> 01:40:12,640
Very well, Mr. tauber. Officer serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

1263
01:40:12,811 --> 01:40:16,470
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1264
01:40:16,936 --> 01:40:20,175
Serpico: Why didn't you tell them
about Delaney, kellogg?

1265
01:40:20,353 --> 01:40:25,762
Frank, this was a grand jury about
police officers engaged in corruption.

1266
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:28,675
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

1267
01:40:28,852 --> 01:40:30,761
Now, that's crap, and you know it.

1268
01:40:30,936 --> 01:40:34,800
Even a dumb cop like me knows
a prosecutor can take a grand jury...

1269
01:40:34,977 --> 01:40:36,511
Anywhere it wants to take lit.

1270
01:40:36,685 --> 01:40:39,140
You never led me
anywhere near the real problems.

1271
01:40:39,311 --> 01:40:42,515
Nothing about the bosses,
the brass.

1272
01:40:42,685 --> 01:40:45,469
How corruption could exist
without anybody knowing.

1273
01:40:45,644 --> 01:40:50,054
Now a few flunky cops in the Bronx,
that's it. None of this shit in queens?

1274
01:40:50,228 --> 01:40:52,932
- Brooklyn? Manhattan?
- Why don't you mention Kansas City?

1275
01:40:53,103 --> 01:40:55,933
"The biggest thing since Harry gross."
That's what you said.

1276
01:40:56,103 --> 01:40:58,386
All right. Look, frank.

1277
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,674
You've got guts, integrity.

1278
01:41:01,852 --> 01:41:05,716
There's gonna be a detective's
gold shield in this for you.

1279
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:10,716
Now, that's terrific. That's good.

1280
01:41:10,894 --> 01:41:14,508
Maybe this is what it's about. I should
take my gold shield and forget it.

1281
01:41:14,685 --> 01:41:17,765
I know you've been through
an ordeal, frank.

1282
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,890
I'm a marked man
in this department for what?

1283
01:41:23,061 --> 01:41:25,050
I've already arranged
a transfer for you.

1284
01:41:25,228 --> 01:41:26,511
To where? China”?

1285
01:41:38,311 --> 01:41:41,015
That takes a 14-shot clip.

1286
01:41:41,186 --> 01:41:43,049
You expecting an army?

1287
01:41:43,228 --> 01:41:45,511
No, just a division.

1288
01:41:47,394 --> 01:41:51,633
Tauber, did you know I've had reports
about serpico being a fag?

1289
01:41:51,811 --> 01:41:54,345
He used to hang out
in the b c.L washroom.

1290
01:41:54,519 --> 01:41:57,599
That's stupid, commissioner,
and you know it.

1291
01:41:58,394 --> 01:42:02,009
You know, Mr. commissioner,
a gold shield for serpico at this time...

1292
01:42:02,186 --> 01:42:05,299
- Would convince a lot of people.
- Not while I'm commissioner.

1293
01:42:24,435 --> 01:42:26,298
Commander's office?

1294
01:42:28,228 --> 01:42:30,341
It's down that corridor.

1295
01:42:33,144 --> 01:42:36,099
Hey, serpico. Do you know what
they're saying in the Bronx?

1296
01:42:36,644 --> 01:42:39,008
That you spilled
your guts to the grand jury.

1297
01:42:39,936 --> 01:42:42,970
Say it isn't so, serpico.

1298
01:42:44,061 --> 01:42:45,799
It isn't so.

1299
01:42:47,019 --> 01:42:49,224
We know how to handle
guys like you.

1300
01:42:50,061 --> 01:42:51,720
I ought to cut your tongue out.

1301
01:42:54,477 --> 01:42:57,466
Man 1: Jesus, serpico.
Man 2: What the hell are you...?

1302
01:42:58,144 --> 01:42:59,723
Don't move.

1303
01:43:21,685 --> 01:43:24,389
Officer serpico
reporting for duty, sir.

1304
01:43:32,186 --> 01:43:35,720
I'm inspector lombardo.
I wanna shake your hand, frank.

1305
01:43:36,936 --> 01:43:39,299
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

1306
01:43:40,936 --> 01:43:43,515
Anybody in this command
you wanna work with?

1307
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:50,804
Well, it's not who I wanna work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

1308
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,141
All right. You can't find anybody
you wanna work with, frank...

1309
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:58,264
I'll work with you.

1310
01:43:58,435 --> 01:44:00,219
That all right”?

1311
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:13,050
Serpico:
How do we get past the lookouts?

1312
01:44:13,227 --> 01:44:16,216
How many you got? One.

1313
01:44:17,977 --> 01:44:19,966
There's two.

1314
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:22,765
- There's the third one.
- There's three of them.

1315
01:44:22,977 --> 01:44:26,181
It's four buildings down. We can try
and get down the fire escape.

1316
01:44:26,352 --> 01:44:28,091
Get in from behind.
What'd you think?

1317
01:44:28,894 --> 01:44:31,133
- Good to you?
- Yeah, let's go.

1318
01:45:14,143 --> 01:45:17,678
- What do you think?
- Wanna try it?

1319
01:45:36,185 --> 01:45:37,219
Serpico: You all right?

1320
01:45:37,394 --> 01:45:41,474
Yeah. I feel just like
a cop again. Thank you.

1321
01:46:10,019 --> 01:46:12,052
Man: Close up.

1322
01:46:14,227 --> 01:46:18,012
Frank, come on. Come on.

1323
01:46:26,602 --> 01:46:28,720
Man 1: Cut it out.
Man 2: I ain't got none. I ain't...

1324
01:46:33,977 --> 01:46:37,261
Get in the other room.
Out of here. Get up against the wall.

1325
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:43,303
What the hell's going on here?
Who the hell are you?

1326
01:46:43,477 --> 01:46:45,511
- Who are you?
- Police. Who do you think?

1327
01:46:45,727 --> 01:46:47,590
Serpico: Fuck against the wall.
Up. Up. Up.

1328
01:46:47,769 --> 01:46:49,132
Let's see your shield.

1329
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:51,924
Wanna see a shield?
All right, there's my shield.

1330
01:46:52,143 --> 01:46:54,427
- Where you from?
- Borough, Manhattan, 8.

1331
01:46:54,602 --> 01:46:56,841
No, goddamn it.
You're not from the borough.

1332
01:46:57,018 --> 01:46:58,678
I paid the borough this morning.

1333
01:46:58,852 --> 01:47:00,260
Hey, frank.

1334
01:47:00,435 --> 01:47:02,153
Johnson:
The hell kind of shakedown is this?

1335
01:47:02,352 --> 01:47:04,215
Who'd you pay in the borough?

1336
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:07,590
Nobody.

1337
01:47:07,769 --> 01:47:10,348
- I didn't pay nobody.
- Who'd you pay in the borough?

1338
01:47:10,519 --> 01:47:13,849
I didn't pay nobody.
Now let go of me.

1339
01:47:14,769 --> 01:47:17,473
Lombardo: We followed up...

1340
01:47:17,644 --> 01:47:19,473
And, uh, there's no doubt about it.

1341
01:47:20,852 --> 01:47:24,136
The pad
here in Manhattan is bigger...

1342
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:27,549
And it's more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

1343
01:47:27,727 --> 01:47:29,966
The pickups here are made...

1344
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:33,883
You wanna get this,
the pickups are made by...

1345
01:47:34,102 --> 01:47:36,762
Retired policemen.

1346
01:47:37,018 --> 01:47:40,633
That way, no, uh, plainclothes men
are directly involved.

1347
01:47:41,143 --> 01:47:46,178
Now, we need investigative help
on this one, chief.

1348
01:47:46,727 --> 01:47:49,181
Well, inspector,
if you need investigative help...

1349
01:47:49,352 --> 01:47:51,181
And you don't trust
your own men...

1350
01:47:51,352 --> 01:47:55,512
Why don't you requisition some
recruits from the police academy?

1351
01:48:02,435 --> 01:48:04,549
With all due respect, sir.

1352
01:48:05,935 --> 01:48:09,095
Backing us up is the only hope
that the police department has got.

1353
01:48:09,268 --> 01:48:11,382
There are good cops
who'd come forward.

1354
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:13,674
If there was any encouragement
todo so

1355
01:48:13,852 --> 01:48:17,215
and if they thought it would do
any good. If not, they won't do it.

1356
01:48:17,519 --> 01:48:20,849
I've done a whole lot more than
most people to defend and preserve...

1357
01:48:21,018 --> 01:48:24,223
The image of this department
and protect commissioner Delaney...

1358
01:48:24,394 --> 01:48:28,884
Against reckless and irresponsible
assaults from outside agencies.

1359
01:48:30,143 --> 01:48:32,052
That's it, huh?

1360
01:48:32,227 --> 01:48:35,307
I mean,
that's what's really important, isn't it?

1361
01:48:35,976 --> 01:48:37,965
That's what you wanna know.

1362
01:48:38,143 --> 01:48:41,382
What outside agencies
I've been to, right?

1363
01:48:42,769 --> 01:48:44,678
Blair: Hello. - Hello, prick.

1364
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:46,889
- Who is this?
- Frank.

1365
01:48:47,227 --> 01:48:48,887
Frank, how are you? Where are you?

1366
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:50,719
I'm ready to go to the times.

1367
01:48:51,519 --> 01:48:55,053
It's a goddamn serious step, frank.

1368
01:48:55,893 --> 01:48:58,553
I don't know if the timing is right.

1369
01:49:00,976 --> 01:49:03,716
Look, I want it to get
on the record, that's all.

1370
01:49:03,893 --> 01:49:06,633
In case something
should happen to me.

1371
01:49:09,893 --> 01:49:12,257
I want it on the record.

1372
01:49:15,018 --> 01:49:17,723
I don't know
if we carry enough weight.

1373
01:49:17,976 --> 01:49:20,556
I don't know if the times
will go out on a limb...

1374
01:49:20,727 --> 01:49:23,591
On the say-so of two flunky cops.

1375
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:29,633
Suppose an inspector
were to come with us.

1376
01:49:30,935 --> 01:49:33,675
Lombardo: You know,
I got 20 years on the force.

1377
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:38,924
Just bought this place.
I sighed a 500-year mortgage on it.

1378
01:49:39,102 --> 01:49:40,965
Will you turn that thing off
out there.

1379
01:49:41,143 --> 01:49:44,473
Okay, come on, everybody to bed.
Come on. Turn that damn thing down.

1380
01:49:44,644 --> 01:49:47,007
Lombardo: Yeah, come on, now.
Come on. Go on upstairs.

1381
01:49:50,143 --> 01:49:53,177
This is against department regulations.
You both know that.

1382
01:49:53,352 --> 01:49:56,432
If they wanna throw
the book at me, they can do it.

1383
01:49:57,602 --> 01:49:59,682
If I left the force

1384
01:50:00,935 --> 01:50:03,174
I don't know what I could do.

1385
01:50:08,851 --> 01:50:13,011
Okay, I made my little speech.
I'll back you up 100 percent.

1386
01:50:17,018 --> 01:50:19,848
Blair: Times and the news.
I got the money, fellas.

1387
01:50:20,018 --> 01:50:22,052
There you go, there you go,
there you go.

1388
01:50:22,227 --> 01:50:24,216
Newsweek, please.

1389
01:50:25,769 --> 01:50:27,882
Holy sh...

1390
01:50:30,185 --> 01:50:31,720
Blair: Oh, Christ.

1391
01:50:31,893 --> 01:50:34,724
You can almost predict
the numbers they're gonna do.

1392
01:50:34,893 --> 01:50:36,973
Delaney's gonna issue
some phony denial.

1393
01:50:37,143 --> 01:50:40,177
Somebody from the mayor's office
will say something noble.

1394
01:50:40,352 --> 01:50:44,261
Delaney will change his tune. Finally
the mayor will appoint a commission.

1395
01:50:44,435 --> 01:50:48,174
Serpico: "Thursday, mayor Lindsay announced
the formation of a special committee...

1396
01:50:48,352 --> 01:50:51,341
To review procedures
for investigating police corruption.”

1397
01:50:51,519 --> 01:50:53,357
Blair: How come I'm not
in the first paragraph?

1398
01:50:54,727 --> 01:50:55,760
Unbelievable

1399
01:50:59,976 --> 01:51:04,840
the times' report smells of the
familiar smear tactics of mccarthyism.

1400
01:51:05,018 --> 01:51:08,007
This government must
and will root out corruption...

1401
01:51:08,185 --> 01:51:10,014
With every means at our command.

1402
01:51:10,727 --> 01:51:14,056
The mayor has this day appointed
a special investigation commission...

1403
01:51:14,227 --> 01:51:15,557
To be headed by Whitman knapp.

1404
01:51:16,935 --> 01:51:17,969
Yeah, come.

1405
01:51:22,268 --> 01:51:23,847
Here's your reward, frank.

1406
01:51:24,018 --> 01:51:27,303
It's a transfer to narcotics,
Brooklyn south.

1407
01:51:27,851 --> 01:51:31,716
Still in clothes. You get a tin shield,
you don't get a gold one.

1408
01:51:35,685 --> 01:51:38,173
I miss you already, frank.

1409
01:51:42,685 --> 01:51:44,298
I ook...

1410
01:51:44,893 --> 01:51:46,802
Frank.

1411
01:51:48,602 --> 01:51:50,840
It's narcotics.

1412
01:51:51,268 --> 01:51:53,302
You be careful.

1413
01:51:53,935 --> 01:51:57,299
It's very easy to, uh, get hurt.

1414
01:51:58,893 --> 01:52:00,882
And to, uh...

1415
01:52:02,018 --> 01:52:03,678
To be set up.

1416
01:52:44,102 --> 01:52:45,886
Serpico.

1417
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,764
Gget in.

1418
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,798
You're not wired, are you?

1419
01:53:07,976 --> 01:53:10,386
Okay, you cocksucker.

1420
01:53:11,143 --> 01:53:14,052
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit

1421
01:53:14,227 --> 01:53:17,715
but down here,
800 a month is chicken feed.

1422
01:53:19,185 --> 01:53:24,970
Last week, one dope dealer sent out
these guys making pickups.

1423
01:53:25,143 --> 01:53:27,553
Forty thousand each.

1424
01:53:27,726 --> 01:53:31,181
We let them collect it all
and then hit them.

1425
01:53:31,643 --> 01:53:35,678
A hundred and twenty thousand
split four ways.

1426
01:53:35,851 --> 01:53:38,261
That's serious money.

1427
01:53:38,435 --> 01:53:42,515
And with that,
you don't fuck around.

1428
01:53:43,519 --> 01:53:45,257
I got the message.

1429
01:53:45,435 --> 01:53:48,344
Good. Now get the fuck out.

1430
01:53:54,643 --> 01:53:57,257
The guy's name is limbo.
He just uses this place...

1431
01:53:57,435 --> 01:54:01,344
His girlfriend's brother's place.
He's a pusher. Heroin.

1432
01:54:01,519 --> 01:54:03,098
We're gonna drive to the corner.

1433
01:54:03,268 --> 01:54:05,473
- Right.
- And you keep in sight out front.

1434
01:54:05,851 --> 01:54:09,386
When you spot somebody who's dirty,
take off your glasses and wipe them.

1435
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:12,139
Right. Okay.

1436
01:55:20,601 --> 01:55:22,040
Serpico:
If we stay here very long...

1437
01:55:22,102 --> 01:55:24,466
We're gonna get spotted.
Heinemann: Well, frank...

1438
01:55:24,684 --> 01:55:26,673
Why don't you go up there
and check it out?

1439
01:55:26,893 --> 01:55:30,007
- Well, why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

1440
01:55:30,227 --> 01:55:32,466
I'll take you shopping. Uh-huh.

1441
01:57:17,518 --> 01:57:19,007
Gerardo: Limbo.

1442
01:57:20,227 --> 01:57:22,011
(Serardo.

1443
01:57:52,018 --> 01:57:53,677
Heinemann: Police freeze.

1444
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:55,181
- Police officer.
Man: All right.

1445
01:57:55,351 --> 01:57:56,994
- To the wall.
Heinemann: Against the wall.

1446
01:57:57,018 --> 01:57:59,007
Goddamn it, get up.

1447
01:57:59,185 --> 01:58:01,594
All right. Palms up on the wall
and spread them.

1448
01:58:01,768 --> 01:58:03,927
- Get them up. Spread them.
Man: Hands up. Come on.

1449
01:58:04,102 --> 01:58:05,431
Spread them. Man: Feet apart.

1450
01:58:06,351 --> 01:58:08,070
- I saw the buy.
Heinemann: Let's get limbo.

1451
01:58:08,143 --> 01:58:09,222
Man: Julio, you all right?

1452
01:58:09,393 --> 01:58:11,382
Julio: Yeah, yeah. I got them.

1453
01:59:14,476 --> 01:59:15,635
Serpico: Police officer.

1454
01:59:26,227 --> 01:59:28,011
What the fuck are you waiting for?

1455
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:51,640
Heinemann: Police. Throw out your guns
and come out with your hands up.

1456
02:00:26,476 --> 02:00:29,090
Man: What do you got here?
- It's Mr. and Mrs. serpico, sir.

1457
02:00:29,267 --> 02:00:31,097
Man: Okay.

1458
02:00:34,393 --> 02:00:35,472
Woman: Yes?

1459
02:00:36,851 --> 02:00:39,214
- Where's our son?
- They're bringing him down from X-ray.

1460
02:00:39,393 --> 02:00:42,133
We want to see him.
“Just a few minutes.

1461
02:01:09,851 --> 02:01:14,681
Mr. and Mrs. serpico.
The news is better than we expected.

1462
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:19,924
Thank god,
the bullet was a small caliber.

1463
02:01:20,434 --> 02:01:23,468
It didn't enter the brain.

1464
02:01:23,643 --> 02:01:26,507
Or strike the spinal cord.

1465
02:01:27,184 --> 02:01:29,639
He's on the critical list

1466
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:33,765
but his condition
seems to be stable.

1467
02:01:34,267 --> 02:01:36,256
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

1468
02:02:10,101 --> 02:02:13,011
Stay out of there.
Didn't they tell you?

1469
02:02:13,184 --> 02:02:14,764
What?

1470
02:02:14,935 --> 02:02:18,924
The word is, don't talk to him.
He's no fucking good.

1471
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:31,093
- How you doing, kid?
Serpico: Hello, sid.

1472
02:02:37,267 --> 02:02:39,347
How are you?

1473
02:02:42,476 --> 02:02:44,931
Wanna read my fan mail?

1474
02:02:45,101 --> 02:02:46,840
Sure.

1475
02:02:47,018 --> 02:02:49,802
You're a big shot now, huh?

1476
02:03:13,643 --> 02:03:15,256
Sid.

1477
02:03:17,267 --> 02:03:21,506
I want you to get those fucking cops
away from my door.

1478
02:03:31,684 --> 02:03:34,923
The knapp commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

1479
02:03:35,101 --> 02:03:37,010
Well, naturally.

1480
02:03:41,142 --> 02:03:43,051
Frank,
heinemann and Julio are cleared.

1481
02:03:43,226 --> 02:03:46,056
The three of you are up
for exceptional merit awards.

1482
02:03:47,351 --> 02:03:49,431
That's very funny.

1483
02:03:54,518 --> 02:03:56,677
It's very funny.

1484
02:03:58,434 --> 02:04:00,593
Francesco, you love me?

1485
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:04,552
I always had a thing for you, sid.
You know that

1486
02:04:08,893 --> 02:04:11,302
your gold shield's come through.

1487
02:04:39,643 --> 02:04:41,882
What's this for?

1488
02:04:45,267 --> 02:04:48,926
For being an honest cop”? Hmm?

1489
02:04:50,267 --> 02:04:54,131
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

1490
02:04:57,810 --> 02:05:01,549
You tell them they can shove it.

1491
02:05:06,309 --> 02:05:08,172
I don't want it.

1492
02:05:47,017 --> 02:05:49,176
Oh, well.

1493
02:05:53,309 --> 02:05:56,173
Well, frank, the facts are these:

1494
02:05:56,351 --> 02:05:59,590
You'll have to stay on leave of absence
for a few months.

1495
02:05:59,768 --> 02:06:03,177
In all probability, the hearing
in your left ear won't come back.

1496
02:06:03,351 --> 02:06:06,090
Two bullet fragments
are still lodged in the bony portion.

1497
02:06:06,267 --> 02:06:08,347
One is very close
to the carotid artery...

1498
02:06:08,518 --> 02:06:11,052
And you'll have to be checked
from time to time.

1499
02:06:11,226 --> 02:06:13,806
Your left side
will feel stiff occasionally.

1500
02:06:14,810 --> 02:06:17,923
Once in a great while
you may experience some dizziness.

1501
02:06:18,101 --> 02:06:20,761
But in general you'll be okay.

1502
02:06:38,601 --> 02:06:40,555
Through my appearance
here today...

1503
02:06:40,726 --> 02:06:43,135
I hope that police officers
in the future

1504
02:06:43,309 --> 02:06:46,048
will not experience
the same frustration and anxiety...

1505
02:06:46,226 --> 02:06:49,306
That I was subjected to
for the past five years...

1506
02:06:49,476 --> 02:06:51,430
At the hands of my superiors...

1507
02:06:51,601 --> 02:06:54,055
Because of my attempt
to report corruption.

1508
02:06:54,226 --> 02:06:56,385
I was made to feel
that I had burdened them ..

1509
02:06:56,559 --> 02:06:58,888
With an unwanted task.

1510
02:06:59,059 --> 02:07:02,423
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist...

1511
02:07:02,601 --> 02:07:04,464
In which an honest police officer...

1512
02:07:04,643 --> 02:07:09,132
Can act without fear of ridicule
or reprisal from fellow officers.

1513
02:07:09,309 --> 02:07:11,093
Police corruption cannot exist...

1514
02:07:11,267 --> 02:07:15,097
Unless it is at least tolerated
at higher levels in the department.

1515
02:07:15,267 --> 02:07:18,801
Therefore, the most important result
that can come from these hearings...

1516
02:07:18,975 --> 02:07:22,884
Is a conviction by police officers
that the department will change.

1517
02:07:23,643 --> 02:07:25,006
In order to ensure this.

1518
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:28,014
An independent, permanent
investigative body...

1519
02:07:28,184 --> 02:07:32,674
Dealing with police corruption,
like this commission, is essential.
