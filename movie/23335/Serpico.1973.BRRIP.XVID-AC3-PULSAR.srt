1
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:12,617
This is car 2118.
Call Greenpoint Hospital.

2
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,619
We're bringing in a wounded cop.

3
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:17,539
All right, 10-4.

4
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:28,717
8th Precinct.

5
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:34,347
Jesus Christ.

6
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:46,109
Guess who got shot.

7
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:49,863
Serpico.

8
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:54,618
You think a cop did it?

9
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,828
I know six cops
said they'd like to.

10
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:14,805
Hello.

11
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,767
New York Times.
Serpico's been shot.

12
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:21,645
Oh, my God!

13
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:23,814
- They're taking him to Greenpoint.
- I'll see you there.

14
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:54,738
To be a police officer
means to believe in the law...

15
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,282
and to enforce it impartially...

16
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:59,451
respecting the equality
of all men...

17
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:02,621
and the dignity and worth
of every individual.

18
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:07,459
Every day, your life
will be on the line...

19
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,878
and also your character.

20
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,507
You'll need integrity,
courage, honesty...

21
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,676
compassion, courtesy...

22
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:18,512
and perseverance...

23
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,680
and patience.

24
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:25,310
You men are now prepared
to join the war against crime...

25
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:29,189
and put the theory you have learned
into practice in the streets.

26
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,700
Same time, same place.
Both reports.

27
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:43,662
I already made out a 424.

28
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:46,248
- You covering this, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Chief Green.

29
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,333
Who was with Serpico?

30
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,795
- Heinemann and Julio.
- I want them interrogated.

31
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,589
I want this conducted as an official
departmental investigation.

32
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:57,008
Transcripts by 9:00 a.m.

33
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:11,148
Another thing. I want 
a 24-hour guard on Serpico.

34
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,483
- Yes, sir.
- You two, over there.

35
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,586
Anthony Sardo.

36
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:20,133
Ralph Seidler.

37
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:26,765
Frank Serpico.

38
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,407
Come on.
Marianne wants a good shot.

39
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:47,035
Get closer!

40
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,440
Patrolman Serpico.

41
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:20,152
Upstairs.
See the roll-call man.

42
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,545
Memorize your posts and sectors.
This week you're 8:00 to 4:00.

43
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:41,048
Next week, 4:00 to midnight.
Grab a locker.

44
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:44,217
Any questions, older guys will
fill you in. Good luck.

45
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:09,201
Yo! 8:00.
Let's go! Come on!

46
00:08:09,284 --> 00:08:11,828
Gather around. Let's go.

47
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,872
All right. Settle down.

48
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,545
All right. Just a few announcements
today and two new men.

49
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:24,299
On the board on my left,
you see squad one, blue sector...

50
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:26,551
squad two, red sector...

51
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:28,553
squad three, green sector.

52
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:32,933
Now, we want summonses,
summonses, summonses.

53
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,768
I'll help the boys, Florence.

54
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:37,104
- This is Frank Serpico, Charlie.
- Hello, Frank.

55
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:39,398
- Hello, Charlie.
- How about some creamed chicken?

56
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:42,317
- Sounds good to me.
- No, I think I'll have...

57
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:45,237
How about a roast beef on roll?

58
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:52,411
Yeah, okay. You go through
the line. I'll bring it over.

59
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:58,458
Peluce, it's all fat here.

60
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:04,715
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Take it easy.

61
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:07,259
Sit down, sit down.

62
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,887
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

63
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:13,807
Well, I'm not fussy.
I don't know how I'm gonna eat this.

64
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,352
Charlie's okay. We give him a break
on double parking on deliveries.

65
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:26,611
Couldn't I pay for it,
get what I want?

66
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:29,406
Frank, generally, you just sort of
take what Charlie gives you.

67
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:41,543
Sector D-David, 1034,
possible rape in progress...

68
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:46,006
vicinity of PS 218,
Grand Avenue and BQ Expressway.

69
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,719
Becker, aren't
we gonna take that?

70
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:53,388
Relax, Frank.
It's not our sector.

71
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:57,684
It's on the borderline.

72
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,437
I'm gonna take it.

73
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,190
D sector, 1547, 10-4.

74
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:36,390
Oh, my God!

75
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,563
Hold it! Hold it!
Police officers!

76
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:46,108
Oh, shit!

77
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,402
- Come on. Give us
- Don't shoot now.

78
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:49,945
Be cool.

79
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:52,531
All right. Okay.
Put your guns away.

80
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:54,950
Put your guns away, man.
Come on. Goddamn it!

81
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,786
I said put them
motherfucking guns away!

82
00:10:57,869 --> 00:10:59,955
I'll cut her, goddamn it.

83
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,252
Turn the motherfucking
light out, man.

84
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:07,879
I'll cut her, man.
I'll cut her.

85
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:11,091
Now, you just be cool,
goddamn it.

86
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,260
Just be cool. All right.

87
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:16,096
All right. All right.
That's it.

88
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:43,457
The other one took his thing out.

89
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:48,754
He put it up to my mouth.

90
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,966
He... He held me down.

91
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:57,763
They said if I didn't do it...

92
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,807
they'd kill me.

93
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:08,732
She's gonna make
a hell of a witness.

94
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,901
Would you like a stretcher?

95
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:26,833
Muscles, he's all yours.
I'll call you from the hospital.

96
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,881
Okay, hard-on.

97
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:18,176
Who were your playmates?

98
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:26,017
Hey, Frank, you want
a piece of this?

99
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:28,687
No. I'm gonna fill out
the arrest card.

100
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,920
Hey, Charlie, let me have
five minutes with him.

101
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:55,922
- Sure.
- Thanks.

102
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,804
Thank you, Charlie.

103
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:14,191
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?

104
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:16,902
How come you didn't
stay for the fun?

105
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:19,071
That's not my kind of fun.

106
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:22,407
Shit.

107
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:27,079
I want to talk to you.

108
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:30,665
I want to take you across the
street, get you a cup of coffee...

109
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:32,376
without cuffs.

110
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:38,590
Now, look. I didn't touch you
upstairs, right?

111
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:41,718
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back.

112
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,220
Understand?

113
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:46,932
Come on.

114
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:54,439
It's a goddamn shame you gotta take
this whole rap yourself.

115
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:59,778
I don't know. Maybe you're guilty,
maybe you're not.

116
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:04,282
Maybe you just
went along for the ride.

117
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:06,618
I got a feeling
you just went along.

118
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,164
But you're the one
who got caught.

119
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:13,542
You never even
got your cock out.

120
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,461
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.

121
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:25,178
Look at you.

122
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,931
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.

123
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:33,645
I don't understand you,
you know that?

124
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,814
What are you,
obligated to those guys?

125
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:38,859
Fuck it.
They left you holding the bag.

126
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,986
You don't owe them nothin'.

127
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:46,491
They're gonna put you away,
you know that?

128
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:48,535
What can I get?

129
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:53,373
Oh, let's see...
Kidnapping...

130
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:55,584
Sodomy, rape...

131
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,962
Are you kidding me?

132
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:08,305
You talk to me.
Save yourself.

133
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,144
Let it go, Harv!

134
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,740
Take the shot.

135
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:28,992
You not gonna send someone over?
Look, look.

136
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,369
McCoy, I get one,
I'm gonna lose the other.

137
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:35,624
Look, Serpico, that's Muscles' case.
He's off for a couple days.

138
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:38,585
- I can't cut in, Frank.
- They're here now!

139
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:40,587
- It'll keep.
- No, it won't!

140
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:10,158
Police officer!
Hold it! Hold it!

141
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,577
Turn around. Turn around.

142
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,749
Spread!

143
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,795
Come on, man. Come on.
Please take that gun from my head.

144
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:23,797
Turn around slow.

145
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:40,355
We'll take it from here, kid.
You don't have to hang around.

146
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,278
What are you talking about?
That's my collar.

147
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:50,198
We take the collar.

148
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,577
A collar like this, don't look good,
a patrolman takes it.

149
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,996
Wait a minute.
I don't care how it looks.

150
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,125
Now, I did the work. I broke my ass
on this. It's my collar.

151
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,545
You really want the collar, kid?
You can be brought up on charges.

152
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:08,300
Left your post, the street, entered
the school yard without permission...

153
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:11,344
That's just for openers.
Right, Penella?

154
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:16,224
No memo entry. Shit. You'll be lucky
to end up with a reprimand.

155
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:18,894
We'll give you an assist
on the arrest, kid.

156
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:26,902
Come on, Frankie!

157
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,405
Jim, get out of the way!
What are you doing?

158
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,035
What you want me to do?
Go across the street?

159
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:55,389
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Uncle Will. How you doing?

160
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,522
- Hey, Pasquale.
- Hey, Frankie! How you doing?

161
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:05,732
Okay. How you doing?
Where's Pop?

162
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:08,777
Be back in a half hour.
How's it going, Frankie?

163
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,029
Okay.
I come to get my shoes.

164
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:13,448
Rev it up. Rev it up!

165
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:18,412
- Here they are.
- Frankie, how you doing?

166
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:20,414
Okay. Good job.

167
00:19:20,497 --> 00:19:22,457
You people do good work here.

168
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:26,795
So, how you doing, Frankie?

169
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:30,132
You keep asking me that. What's
the matter with you? I'm doing okay!

170
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:34,177
Well, I thought you were coming over
to the house Saturday night.

171
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,346
I'm sorry, Pasquale.
I couldn't make it.

172
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,058
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed...

173
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:44,062
Now, look. I don't like that.
I mean, really.

174
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:47,816
Don't invite people over
if you're not sure I'm gonna come.

175
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,652
I mean it, now. If I want to
see Marianne, I'll call her.

176
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,947
What's going on
with you two anyway?

177
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,367
Hey, Pasquale,
I'm gonna tell you something.

178
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:01,913
See, all day long,
I work with cops. Right?

179
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:04,541
Now, when I go out,
I see Marianne...

180
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:08,712
her father's a cop, her brother's
a cop, her uncle's a cop.

181
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:11,840
- I got a feeling she's a cop too.
- Come here!

182
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:17,304
- How you doing on the job?
- It's got its problems.

183
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:20,766
Mama tells me that you're looking
for a new apartment. Is that true?

184
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:23,101
- Yeah.
- So, where are you going?

185
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:26,772
I don't know.
I'm looking around by school.

186
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:28,774
NYU? Greenwich Village?

187
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:31,026
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.
- What's the matter?

188
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,278
The old neighborhood's
not good enough for ya?

189
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:35,155
Tell Pop I was here.

190
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:37,115
Frankie, Sunday?

191
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,701
Sunday what?

192
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,912
Dinner? Huh?

193
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:46,208
- Do me one favor- no Marianne.
- I know. No Marianne.

194
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,377
All right.
A couple of announcements.

195
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:50,712
"Announcing a course in
fingerprint identification...

196
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,881
to be given at John Jay College.

197
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:55,050
This course will be available
to those patrolmen...

198
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,219
who wish to make themselves
eligible for assignment...

199
00:20:57,302 --> 00:21:00,472
to the Bureau of
Criminal Identification, BCI...

200
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:03,934
which is generally considered to be
a path to a detective's gold shield.

201
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:06,853
Signed, Captain McGuire."

202
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:09,106
On the board on my left,
you see squad one...

203
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,277
Hot enough for ya?

204
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,072
It's not the heat.
It's the humidity.

205
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:19,408
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

206
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:42,472
You know how long
you're taking on that one?

207
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:45,934
Check one print category, two-
That's plenty.

208
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:51,648
I'm not gonna give a guy a
"no record" when he might have one.

209
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:55,777
How long you been
with the BCI now, Serpico?

210
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,405
All my life.

211
00:21:58,488 --> 00:22:01,700
That's long enough to know
how we do things.

212
00:22:01,783 --> 00:22:05,203
Barto, it's not just that.

213
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:08,040
You don't like me.

214
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:10,667
BCI never had
a weirdo cop before.

215
00:22:11,752 --> 00:22:14,129
Barto, stop buggin' me.

216
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:25,974
Mama?

217
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:07,784
Wanna buy a puppy?

218
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,004
Look at that, huh?

219
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,549
Where'd you get these dogs?

220
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,719
Oh, they're mine.

221
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:28,930
Want one for free?

222
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:34,519
- I'll pay for it. How much?
- Five dollars.

223
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:38,190
You got it.

224
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:46,823
Okay, now which one
of you guys wanna come with me?

225
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:48,325
What?

226
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,621
Come on.

227
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:54,539
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

228
00:24:54,581 --> 00:24:57,626
Just watch the car and my stuff
over here, 'cause I'm movin' in.

229
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,628
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

230
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:32,160
Don Quixote.

231
00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:51,430
Señorita Land?

232
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:58,645
Mr. Serpico.

233
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:01,606
I got my horse here.
Maybe I could drop you someplace.

234
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:04,317
Well, I'm going to work
at the Café Reggio.

235
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:06,319
Café Reggio.

236
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,076
- That's 4th Street and-
- MacDougal and 3rd.

237
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,370
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yeah. Sure.

238
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:18,331
Jesus, what's that?

239
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,792
You got your hands on
my money belt. Don't do that.

240
00:26:20,876 --> 00:26:23,253
That's not a money belt.
That's a gun.

241
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:26,590
- Well, we gotta eat, don't we?
- Oh, come on!

242
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:30,927
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?

243
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:32,929
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm their lion tamer.

244
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:34,931
- Come on.
- That's the truth.

245
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,476
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?

246
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,978
- What do you do?
- Me?

247
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:44,316
I'm an actress, a singer,
a dancer and a Buddhist.

248
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:47,277
In that order?

249
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,698
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.

250
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:16,890
Those leaps that guy made,
what do you call 'em again?

251
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:18,558
Jetés.

252
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,857
You try it.

253
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:28,985
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?

254
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:37,244
Next life. Come on.

255
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:42,749
What are you reading now,
Serpico?

256
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:48,422
My Life by Isadora Duncan.

257
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:51,967
She was a ballet dancer.

258
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:53,301
A belly dancer?

259
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:58,974
No. No, a ballet dancer.
Ballet.

260
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:03,186
- You know ballet?
- A little.

261
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,982
- A little bit? You ever see one?
- Not close.

262
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:09,943
I've been to the ballet.
It's terrific.

263
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:12,571
- I've been taking classes.
- Oh, yeah?

264
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:14,573
That's where I go
after I leave here.

265
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:17,659
Fantastic for your body.
Really builds you up.

266
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:20,162
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?

267
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:21,371
I noticed.

268
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,040
There's five positions.

269
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:25,250
Five pos-
You're being shortchanged.

270
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,170
- Oh, no. It's enough. Believe me.
- For what?

271
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:30,797
Watch. See?

272
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,466
This is the first position.

273
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:34,801
From this position,
I can do anything.

274
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:36,678
- You want to see?
- Sure.

275
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,680
Here we go.

276
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:44,644
Bye, Barto!

277
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:48,273
- Lieutenant Steiger-
- No, no. Later.

278
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,824
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Potts, I wanted to read.

279
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:00,994
Positions, positions!

280
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,122
Positions like that you don't see
in a pretzel factory.

281
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:07,250
Now I gotta do my pee-pee
in the dark.

282
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:10,462
She's gotta be a nympho
with positions like that.

283
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:13,507
Hey, Serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

284
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,592
Barto wants a specimen.

285
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:17,969
I'm gonna look into this matter.

286
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:25,352
- What do you got there?
- Here.

287
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:27,020
Straight ahead.

288
00:29:28,855 --> 00:29:31,817
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

289
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,363
- I don't see anything over there.
- Let me see.

290
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:40,826
She just pulled down the shade.

291
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:44,955
- You gotta be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.

292
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,127
Hold it, Serpico.
What were you two doing?

293
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:54,005
- What?
- In the shithouse in the dark!

294
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:56,341
Were you goin' down on him?

295
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:03,056
- What are you talking about?
- You gonna tell me you were peeping?

296
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,059
You were sucking his cock,
weren't you?

297
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:08,562
- What are you, crazy?
- I'll show you fuckin' crazy!

298
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:12,274
Last week I found a pair of shorts
with semen on 'em!

299
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:15,026
There!

300
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:19,990
You actually accusing me of this?

301
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,329
Good morning, Captain McCIain.
I'm Officer Serpico.

302
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:28,582
I was told I could
talk to you, sir.

303
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:34,171
Certainly, son.
Come in.

304
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:40,427
Lieutenant Steiger
won't make a report.

305
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,097
He's too concerned with
the image of his department.

306
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:47,476
But it- it could affect
your future in the BCI.

307
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:53,440
Sir, I tell you...

308
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:55,776
Frankly,
I don't see any future there.

309
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:00,030
It was bullshit about it being
a path toward being detective...

310
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:02,282
because I've been there
two years now...

311
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:04,284
And you want a transfer.

312
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:08,038
Yes, sir, but I don't wanna
go back to uniform.

313
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:11,833
I'll see what I can do, Frank.

314
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,630
Francis, do you know about my
weekend retreats for Catholic officers?

315
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,845
Well, you read that.
It might be of interest to you.

316
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:25,514
You are Catholic?

317
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:30,143
- Yeah. I was baptized, yes.
- Good, good.

318
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:34,356
Alfie, come on.

319
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,568
I missed you, baby.

320
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:43,240
She's so crazy, that girl,
I tell you.

321
00:31:43,323 --> 00:31:45,033
Why Paco?

322
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:48,120
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favor?

323
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:51,540
- Get my keys out of this pocket.
- Sure.

324
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:55,460
Well, what'll I call you...

325
00:31:55,544 --> 00:31:57,546
Frank or Paco?

326
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:16,523
Sally! Larry!
This is Paco.

327
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:19,109
- Hey, man.
- Larry's a poet.

328
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:21,445
But he works for
an advertising agency.

329
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:24,072
Sally's an actress,
but works for a photographer.

330
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:25,449
Paco's a policeman.

331
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,576
That's terrific.

332
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,202
I work for the police department.

333
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:31,413
- That's really nice.
- Wow.

334
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,707
See ya.

335
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,669
- How are you?
- Pat's a novelist.

336
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:40,005
But you're working for an insurance
company now, aren't you?

337
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,632
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. Paco's a policeman.

338
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:44,760
Really? How exciting!

339
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:48,263
Well, not too.
Right now, I'm filing fingerprints.

340
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:50,974
Listen,
I file insurance policies.

341
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:54,061
We should get together then,
file or something.

342
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:57,147
- That was an improvement.
- I wanna ask you something.

343
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:01,651
How come all your friends are
on their way to being somebody else?

344
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:05,030
Think about that. I wanna
ask you something else too.

345
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:07,157
Will you do me a big favor?

346
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,242
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

347
00:33:09,326 --> 00:33:12,245
You know, let me just sort of
do it myself.

348
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:14,247
Okay.

349
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:24,549
Hey, man,
are you really a cop?

350
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:28,345
- Right. I am.
- Wow.

351
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:31,515
You know,
Leslie is a mind fucker.

352
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:34,851
You gotta be kidding.
I didn't know that.

353
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:36,728
What's a mind fucker?

354
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,855
Well, that's a chick...

355
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:42,234
who digs intellectual types
and super-bright guys.

356
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,403
Oh, yeah?

357
00:33:44,486 --> 00:33:46,738
Well, she's very perceptive.

358
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:56,039
You know, Japanese culture
and theater and painting...

359
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:58,083
it's too rigidly stylized.

360
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:01,712
Well, yeah, you know-
Yeah, but...

361
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:06,258
I think after a while,
when you get through that...

362
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:11,138
you start to appreciate the
clarity- you know, the authority.

363
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:13,849
I got a sheep dog.

364
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:16,977
There have been
sheep dogs in my family...

365
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,396
dating back...

366
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:21,189
for 16 generations...

367
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:25,193
- Dating back to the Borgias.
- Oh, shit!

368
00:34:26,278 --> 00:34:28,947
The family crest...

369
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,367
is a sheep dog
pissing into a gondola.

370
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,869
Oh, shit!

371
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,837
Paco, everybody loves you!

372
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,256
I love you!

373
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:48,592
Hey, Lieutenant,
my wife call for me?

374
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:56,933
Give her this, will ya?

375
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:01,480
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.

376
00:35:01,563 --> 00:35:04,858
That fucking thing on your lip,
it goes. And get a haircut.

377
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:06,818
- Sir-
- That's an order.

378
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:08,820
You look like an asshole
with dentures.

379
00:35:11,114 --> 00:35:15,577
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure. Go see Captain Tolkin.

380
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,246
You got one foot in shit already.
Put the other one in.

381
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,582
Where might that be,
I wonder, sir?

382
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:23,919
Thank you, sir.

383
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,881
That is one hell of a mustache.
I wish I had the guts.

384
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:33,470
Well, I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

385
00:35:33,553 --> 00:35:36,264
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I'd like to tell ya, sir.

386
00:35:36,348 --> 00:35:38,392
I thought so.

387
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,022
I think it's time that we started
to communicate more on the streets.

388
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:46,900
You know, the way it is,
we're totally isolated, sir.

389
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:50,028
We're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

390
00:35:50,112 --> 00:35:52,572
An undercover cop walks around
in disguise...

391
00:35:52,656 --> 00:35:54,616
wearing black shoes
and white socks.

392
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:57,619
Everybody knows who he is.

393
00:35:57,703 --> 00:35:59,955
You made your point.

394
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:02,332
I want you to keep your mustache.

395
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,961
And I'd like you to patrol
in your own car.

396
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:08,964
Wear whatever you want.
How does that strike you?

397
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:10,841
I'd like that, sir.

398
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:13,969
To be honest,
I'm bucking for detective.

399
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:15,470
No shit.

400
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,649
Hold it!

401
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:14,154
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:18,283
Oh, Christ!

403
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:21,620
Quick. Get against there.

404
00:37:24,164 --> 00:37:26,124
I'm a police officer!
Get over there!

405
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:28,710
Hey! It's me, Serpico!

406
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:34,424
Hey, I'm a police officer!
Police officer!

407
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:36,885
Poli- I'm an officer!
I'm a police officer!

408
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,971
Jesus, Frank, how was I
supposed to recognize you?

409
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:44,518
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!

410
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:48,563
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?

411
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:51,983
You fire without a warning,
without a fucking brain in your head?

412
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,903
Oh, shit.

413
00:37:56,822 --> 00:37:59,616
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

414
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,709
Holy shit.

415
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,919
Look at that mess.

416
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,300
Filling out forms till next month.

417
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:19,136
Good.

418
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:21,304
Hey, Jesus, Frank...

419
00:38:21,388 --> 00:38:23,640
I know it's a hell
of a time to ask you...

420
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:26,226
but I'm gonna have to go through
all that ballistics bullshit...

421
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:27,561
Good. You should.

422
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:31,356
It's gonna look like hell if I
don't have anything to show for it.

423
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,776
Frank, do me a favor.
Give us the collar.

424
00:38:40,157 --> 00:38:41,408
You motherfucker.

425
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:48,832
You want the collar, huh? You
don't wanna fill out forms, right?

426
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,181
Here.

427
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:08,602
- You're a buddy.
- I'm a buddy.

428
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:12,647
Only you tell Tolkin
I gave it to you.

429
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:16,818
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample...

430
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:19,780
so that when you become
plainclothesmen...

431
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:23,700
you'll be able to identify
the pungent aroma...

432
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:27,329
and recognize the disorienting effect
of the drug...

433
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:32,167
when you observe them
in narcotics suspects.

434
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:34,503
Among users of the drug...

435
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:36,963
a marijuana cigarette...

436
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:40,175
is referred to as reefer...

437
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:44,679
stick, roach, joint.

438
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:48,642
The drug itself
is referred to as pot...

439
00:39:48,725 --> 00:39:50,644
tea, boo...

440
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,814
stuff, grass.

441
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:57,901
Hey, this is real good shit.

442
00:39:58,568 --> 00:40:01,446
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.

443
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,242
Look what it is.
It's a potato factory is what it is.

444
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:08,495
And I have to have some,
and I love you- I love it.

445
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:12,708
Have some of that. We have
nothing to- I have to have a dime?

446
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,711
The dime goes
in the little slot there.

447
00:40:15,752 --> 00:40:18,839
That doesn't work.
It's from the Civil War, this machine.

448
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,717
- Pull on it.
- Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't...

449
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,094
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Shoot it out. Please!

450
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:27,514
I beg of you! Come out!
Potatoes, come out!

451
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:32,269
You're pretty fuckin' weird
for a cop.

452
00:40:32,352 --> 00:40:34,730
Me? You!

453
00:40:34,771 --> 00:40:37,065
- What about you, buddy? You!
- You're the weird guy. Me?

454
00:40:37,149 --> 00:40:39,568
- You're a fuckin' hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.

455
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:41,111
The two of us.

456
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,115
Give me.

457
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:49,161
Where you supposed
to go from here?

458
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:53,832
93 Precinct, plainclothes.
Put your gun away.

459
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:57,753
You?

460
00:40:57,836 --> 00:41:00,881
I am scheduled to go
on special assignment...

461
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:04,468
with the mayor's department
of investigations, detective squad.

462
00:41:06,887 --> 00:41:09,639
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.

463
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:12,059
No fouryears in plainclothes?

464
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:15,812
Who do you know?

465
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:19,733
I make it my business to know
people- people who can help.

466
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,234
Unfair.

467
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:24,529
Unfair.

468
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:26,907
Life is unfair, pal.

469
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:30,452
I mean, look, you've got
a feel for the streets, and I...

470
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:33,038
- I've got a feel for the politics.
- Oh, yeah?

471
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:37,000
You and me in a Batmobile, we could
clean up the whole city in no time.

472
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:39,669
I wonder ifwe can get candy
out of this machine though.

473
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:47,636
No, thanks.

474
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:54,893
Well, this is a good place
to tell you, Paco.

475
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:00,690
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

476
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:07,781
- What about him?
- I'm gonna marry him in two months...

477
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:09,908
unless you marry me.

478
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,879
What about the theater
and your dancing?

479
00:42:23,964 --> 00:42:26,049
A girl has to get
married sometime.

480
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:30,178
Well, you're a long way
from sometime, Leslie.

481
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:33,348
I thought you were committed.

482
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,685
I am, but...

483
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:40,689
You are, but?

484
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,861
I can go on working,
studying there.

485
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,572
Where? Fort Worth?

486
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,283
Amarillo.

487
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:03,003
Well, am I invited
to the wedding?

488
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:07,215
I'll ask Roy.

489
00:43:12,804 --> 00:43:15,223
Yeah, it's pretty good
in this precinct.

490
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:17,267
Here you go.

491
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:21,229
Usually a 9:00 to 5:00 day is the
best time for policy and bookmaking.

492
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:25,692
If you have to work nights, like
a liquor violation, just call in.

493
00:43:25,734 --> 00:43:28,111
Don't worry about
quotas right now.

494
00:43:28,195 --> 00:43:31,323
Couple of hooker collars
will keep it cool.

495
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:44,544
Been holding this for you.

496
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:47,089
It's from Jewish Max.

497
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:45,522
First day on the precinct,
I get that.

498
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:50,235
This is great, Frank.

499
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,115
I can open up a whole can
of peas with this.

500
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:56,783
It's scary.

501
00:44:57,993 --> 00:45:00,704
I wanna protect myself.

502
00:45:00,787 --> 00:45:02,956
- You know what we do with this?
- What?

503
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,625
We take it to
Inspector Kellogg.

504
00:45:10,964 --> 00:45:14,342
Kellogg- Didn't he used
to be in plainclothes?

505
00:45:14,426 --> 00:45:17,971
He's the second-highest ranking cop
in the department of investigations.

506
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:20,348
- So what?
- What do you mean, "so what?"

507
00:45:20,432 --> 00:45:22,684
I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

508
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:24,853
He owes me.
You understand?

509
00:45:26,104 --> 00:45:28,356
He's the most honest cop
I know, Frank.

510
00:45:29,733 --> 00:45:32,986
Frank, trust me.

511
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,503
Things like this were common
practice in the bad old days.

512
00:45:49,586 --> 00:45:51,838
Hard to believe
it's still going on.

513
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,220
Serpico, don't you think
it's kind of stupid...

514
00:45:58,303 --> 00:46:01,139
taking an envelope from somebody
you didn't know?

515
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:09,398
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, give me...

516
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:12,609
How would I know what was in it
unless I took it?

517
00:46:12,692 --> 00:46:15,237
You have two alternatives.

518
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:18,657
You can force me to take you to
the commissioner of investigations.

519
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,992
He'll drag you in front
of a grand jury.

520
00:46:21,076 --> 00:46:24,538
- I don't want that.
- I can understand that.

521
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:26,540
Word will get out.

522
00:46:26,623 --> 00:46:30,544
Before it's all over, they'll find
you face-down in the East River.

523
00:46:36,174 --> 00:46:39,594
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.

524
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,932
Well, what do I do with this?

525
00:47:06,163 --> 00:47:08,290
Hey, Sarge?
You got a minute?

526
00:47:11,835 --> 00:47:14,796
Colored cop gave me this.
I didn't know what to do with it.

527
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:23,930
Well, I'll send it on
to the Benevolent Association.

528
00:47:35,692 --> 00:47:37,652
Alfie, come on.

529
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:01,301
Is that Bjoerling?

530
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:09,684
No. It's DiStefano.

531
00:48:11,853 --> 00:48:14,439
I was sure it was Bjoerling.

532
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:24,241
You could hear it
better over here.

533
00:48:25,158 --> 00:48:27,327
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.

534
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:29,913
For coffee.

535
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:34,668
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

536
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:37,879
Why don't you call in sick?
Perfect place.

537
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:40,882
Not me.

538
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:43,218
What are you,
dedicated or somethin'?

539
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:48,014
That's right, I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.

540
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:51,351
- Well, what do they know?
- I like your garden.

541
00:48:57,482 --> 00:48:58,900
Love my garden.

542
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:02,946
Okay. I love your garden.

543
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:06,366
You know what they say,
don't you?

544
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:09,244
No. What do they say?

545
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:13,415
If you love a man's garden,
you gotta love the man.

546
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:21,840
You like her, Alfie?

547
00:49:23,383 --> 00:49:26,053
All I can tell you, sir,
is I gave it back.

548
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:28,555
I gotta get out of the 93.

549
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:31,933
Well, what happened on
your narcotics application?

550
00:49:32,017 --> 00:49:35,979
Looked like it was set, until
I told 'em I was in plainclothes.

551
00:49:36,063 --> 00:49:37,856
It was like
the kiss of death.

552
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:41,193
They think everybody in clothes
is on the take.

553
00:49:41,234 --> 00:49:43,904
Sir, do you know anything about
the Bronx 7th Division?

554
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:47,949
I can go there if I want,
but if it's the same shit, screw it.

555
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:51,495
I'd rather answer phones for Spanish
communications unit and go nuts.

556
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:53,163
Come on, Alfie.

557
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:57,876
Frank, did anyone
ever tell you...

558
00:49:57,959 --> 00:50:00,545
that you have a tendency
toward self-pity?

559
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:04,674
No, you're the first.

560
00:50:04,758 --> 00:50:08,261
All right. Frank, I have
a friend up there, Roy Palmer.

561
00:50:08,345 --> 00:50:12,474
He's an administrative officer.
I'll speak with him.

562
00:50:12,557 --> 00:50:14,851
- Good. Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye, Frank.

563
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:17,062
- God bless you.
- Right.

564
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:28,699
Frank, Captain McCIain here.

565
00:50:28,782 --> 00:50:30,867
Captain McCIain. Could you
hold on a minute please, sir?

566
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:32,369
Sure.

567
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:41,378
Yeah. Sorry.

568
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,380
I saw Inspector Palmer tonight...

569
00:50:43,422 --> 00:50:46,967
and he assures me the 7th Division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

570
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,428
His words, Frank.
"Clean as a hound's tooth."

571
00:50:50,262 --> 00:50:53,223
I told him he was getting
a hardworking officer...

572
00:50:53,306 --> 00:50:57,269
wears a beard, speaks Spanish and
would make a superb undercover man.

573
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:58,562
He was delighted.

574
00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:02,649
That's good news, sir.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

575
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:04,735
Good-bye, Frank.
God bless.

576
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:09,948
When did you start doing that?

577
00:51:11,742 --> 00:51:14,077
McCIain says that Palmer says...

578
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:16,538
that the 7th is as clean
as a hound's tooth.

579
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:20,751
Well, if that's true,
your problems are over.

580
00:51:25,964 --> 00:51:27,924
Plainclothes division.

581
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,178
Upstairs.

582
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:44,775
- How are you? Good to see you!
- All right.

583
00:51:44,858 --> 00:51:46,902
We heard you were
coming up here. Listen.

584
00:51:46,985 --> 00:51:50,113
Say hello to Nate Smith.
Frank Serpico.

585
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:53,033
- Jamie Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico?

586
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:56,453
Hey, babe, you're gonna
love it up here. It's beautiful.

587
00:51:56,536 --> 00:51:58,580
Listen, take-
I'll see youse later, all right?

588
00:51:58,663 --> 00:52:01,041
Take a little ride with me.
Get the feel of the division.

589
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:03,126
- Maybe I should check in first.
- Fuck that. Come on.

590
00:52:04,628 --> 00:52:08,382
Deckk the halls
with boughs ofholly

591
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:16,640
Ten grand, Dallas-
if Minnesota. Right.

592
00:52:16,723 --> 00:52:18,392
Green Bay, 12 and a half at...

593
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:22,437
You dumb fuck.
We told you this location's hot.

594
00:52:22,479 --> 00:52:24,523
We told you to stay the fuck
out of here.

595
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:27,359
Keough, nobody told me.
Honest.

596
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:29,486
Bullshit.

597
00:52:29,569 --> 00:52:31,321
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

598
00:52:31,405 --> 00:52:33,657
Hi, kid.
All right, a C-note apiece.

599
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,786
No way. We got a complaint.
Right, Frank? Come on.

600
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:40,038
All right.
Make it 200, Keough.

601
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:42,958
Hey, what, are you getting cheap
in your old age, bambino?

602
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,669
- Three.
- Three?

603
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:47,379
You heard me.

604
00:52:48,463 --> 00:52:51,675
- All right, three.
- I'll make it a light one.

605
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:58,598
- You wanna write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.

606
00:52:58,682 --> 00:53:00,600
Take the collar, Frank.
Get on the sheet.

607
00:53:00,684 --> 00:53:02,102
I better check in.

608
00:53:04,104 --> 00:53:07,399
We're gonna have
a little talk later, right?

609
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:13,947
That dumb schmuck only came up with
two bills because I booked him?

610
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,326
Here you go, Frank.

611
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,996
It was your collar.
Keep it.

612
00:53:22,456 --> 00:53:24,958
I had a hunch
you weren't gonna take it.

613
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:29,504
You know, Frankie, we got a call
about you from downtown.

614
00:53:29,588 --> 00:53:31,214
Now, I ain't sayin' who.

615
00:53:31,298 --> 00:53:33,925
They just said you couldn't
be trusted, you know?

616
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,804
- Because I don't take money, right?
- Come on, Frank.

617
00:53:37,888 --> 00:53:40,390
Let's face it. Who can trust
a cop who don't take money?

618
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:43,935
I mean, you are pretty weird,
you know, kid?

619
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,772
And with that call, the guys
were gettin' a little worried.

620
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:49,649
I told them you were okay.
I knew you from the old 21.

621
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:53,070
You'd never hurt
another cop, right?

622
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:57,074
You'd never hurt another cop,
would you, Frank?

623
00:53:57,157 --> 00:53:59,951
- That'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frankie.

624
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,501
We're not doing
anything bad here.

625
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:10,253
We're skimming
a little gambling money.

626
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:13,340
It's clean. It's not dope.
It hurts nobody.

627
00:54:13,423 --> 00:54:15,342
Come on, Frank.

628
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:18,720
Gamblers are gentlemen, and
they're gonna operate anyhow, right?

629
00:54:18,804 --> 00:54:21,306
Look, Keough, you don't have to
explain yourself to me.

630
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,518
Do what you got to do.
Want some tea?

631
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:27,562
No, I don't like that shit.
I'll have a coffee, huh?

632
00:54:27,646 --> 00:54:30,273
What's the matter, Frank?
What are you worried about?

633
00:54:30,315 --> 00:54:33,652
Listen.
We don't go overboard here.

634
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:35,737
We're not sloppy.
We're careful.

635
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:39,116
The spicks, niggers, we bust them.
They operate so dumb and sloppy...

636
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:41,284
they get your ass
in hot water every time.

637
00:54:41,326 --> 00:54:43,870
But the Italians, now,
that's a different story.

638
00:54:43,954 --> 00:54:47,165
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.

639
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:50,544
- You really got it analyzed.
- Fuckin' right I got it analyzed.

640
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:52,295
It's worth it.

641
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,882
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

642
00:54:58,009 --> 00:55:02,013
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.

643
00:55:02,097 --> 00:55:06,518
That's 800 clams every time your
girlfriend gets the curse tax free.

644
00:55:07,352 --> 00:55:10,355
Here's the beauty. You don't
get it for the first eight weeks...

645
00:55:10,439 --> 00:55:13,150
till the guys get to
know you and you're okay.

646
00:55:13,233 --> 00:55:15,861
But you don't lose, either, 'cause
you get it on the other end...

647
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:18,655
when you leave the division.

648
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:21,783
Frankie, it's like-
it's like severance pay.

649
00:55:23,368 --> 00:55:26,496
Think it over, all right?
In or out.

650
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:31,877
Look at me. I'm shaking.

651
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:38,300
All my life I wanted
to be a cop, you know?

652
00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:40,761
It's like I can remember
nothing else.

653
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:46,433
I remember this one time...

654
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:49,770
there was...

655
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:52,355
Somethin' happened.
A domestic argument or somethin'.

656
00:55:52,439 --> 00:55:54,358
Somebody stabbed somebody.

657
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,819
And...

658
00:55:57,861 --> 00:56:00,447
there was this crowd
around this tenement.

659
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,868
I must have been nine,
ten years old. I was this big.

660
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:06,870
I went over to see
what was going on.

661
00:56:06,953 --> 00:56:10,165
I noticed the red light
goin' around and around...

662
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:12,667
all these people,
and I couldn't see.

663
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:17,214
I kept saying, "Do you know
what's goin' on? Do you know?"

664
00:56:17,297 --> 00:56:19,466
Nobody knew.

665
00:56:19,549 --> 00:56:22,719
It was like a big mystery
behind that...

666
00:56:22,803 --> 00:56:24,429
that crowd there.

667
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:27,933
All of a sudden...

668
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:30,060
the crowd just parted...

669
00:56:30,143 --> 00:56:32,479
Like the Red Sea, you see?

670
00:56:32,562 --> 00:56:36,149
And there were these guys
in blue, and I said...

671
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:38,026
"They know."

672
00:56:39,111 --> 00:56:42,155
What do they know?
What do they know?

673
00:56:47,452 --> 00:56:49,621
It's amazing.

674
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:51,665
It's incredible...

675
00:56:52,749 --> 00:56:55,711
but I feel like a criminal
'cause I don't take money.

676
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:02,300
You get so tense
when you talk about it.

677
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:03,802
I wonder why.

678
00:57:03,885 --> 00:57:05,470
Come here.

679
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:11,518
- Right there.
- Here?

680
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,606
I'm gonna ask you
a question, okay?

681
00:57:16,648 --> 00:57:18,942
Do you like cops?

682
00:57:19,026 --> 00:57:20,986
You're my first.

683
00:57:22,654 --> 00:57:26,033
No, I mean all this shit I've been
telling you. Do you believe it?

684
00:57:26,116 --> 00:57:27,701
Why not?

685
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,663
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.

686
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:35,375
What's the matter with me?

687
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:37,544
Everybody knows about cops.

688
00:57:38,628 --> 00:57:41,256
Did you ever hear the story
of the wise king?

689
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:44,468
Nope, but I got the feeling
I'm gonna hear it.

690
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:49,973
Well, there was this king,
and he ruled over his kingdom.

691
00:57:50,057 --> 00:57:53,477
Right in the middle of the kingdom
there was a well.

692
00:57:53,518 --> 00:57:55,520
That's where everybody drank.

693
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:59,232
One night,
this witch came along...

694
00:57:59,316 --> 00:58:01,234
and she poisoned the well.

695
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,447
And the next day, everybody drank
from it except the king...

696
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,616
and they all went crazy.

697
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:09,951
They got together
in the street and they said...

698
00:58:10,035 --> 00:58:12,996
"We got to get rid of the king,
'cause the king is mad."

699
00:58:15,332 --> 00:58:18,585
And then that night, he went down
and he drank from the well.

700
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:21,463
And the next day
all the people rejoiced...

701
00:58:21,505 --> 00:58:25,634
because their king
had regained his reason.

702
00:58:29,346 --> 00:58:31,306
I think you're trying
to tell me somethin'.

703
00:58:31,348 --> 00:58:33,183
- Me?
- Yeah.

704
00:58:35,227 --> 00:58:37,687
Hey, Frank, I want you
to say hello to somebody.

705
00:58:37,771 --> 00:58:41,692
- Drop your cocks and grab your socks!
- What the fuck is this?

706
00:58:43,402 --> 00:58:46,154
Frank Serpico,
say hello to Don Rubello.

707
00:58:46,238 --> 00:58:48,323
- He's gonna be your new partner.
- How you doin'?

708
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:53,829
If you don't want to work with this
fucking nut for some reason, man...

709
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,832
I'll buddy up with him,
all right?

710
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:59,209
And go through all that crap
changing assignments?

711
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,378
No. We'll be okay.

712
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:03,296
We're paisans, huh?

713
00:59:06,216 --> 00:59:08,343
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- It's my partner.

714
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:11,179
- Partner?
- He's specially trained, you know?

715
00:59:11,263 --> 00:59:14,391
He goes to track down heroin.

716
00:59:14,474 --> 00:59:17,144
Let him loose, goes into the hole,
picks it up, brings it back...

717
00:59:17,227 --> 00:59:19,688
sniffs it out,
brings it to you.

718
00:59:21,398 --> 00:59:24,151
- Yeah. I heard of that.
- You heard of that?

719
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:31,158
This guy I'm looking for,
Vernon...

720
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,286
He's a numbers collector who ain't
been meeting his obligations.

721
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:39,291
He won't be hard to spot.
He's a mover. This is prime time.

722
00:59:42,836 --> 00:59:46,506
Since we're partners,
you gotta know the situation.

723
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:50,635
Straight off.
I collect for the division...

724
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,804
me and two other bagmen.

725
00:59:52,888 --> 00:59:55,348
That's what Keough
was sort of hinting at.

726
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,312
Three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

727
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,607
Hey!
Look, there he is.

728
01:00:16,203 --> 01:00:18,538
Son of a bitch!

729
01:00:23,043 --> 01:00:25,879
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!

730
01:01:39,911 --> 01:01:41,371
Where's the money?

731
01:01:49,755 --> 01:01:51,840
You been jerking me around,
you fuck! Huh?

732
01:01:51,923 --> 01:01:54,217
Ain't no money!
I'm behind now, man!

733
01:01:58,472 --> 01:02:00,307
Three times you never show,
right?

734
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:04,603
I'll have it for you tonight,
I swear.

735
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:06,605
Don't bust me!

736
01:02:08,482 --> 01:02:11,151
Last time, Vernon.
The last time.

737
01:02:11,234 --> 01:02:15,364
You fuck me and you're gone,
you hear? You hear? Huh?

738
01:02:16,823 --> 01:02:18,867
See you at the Domino,
midnight.

739
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:23,038
And you'd better have $300, ya fuck.
You hear? Right? Right?

740
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,001
All right, Frank.

741
01:02:34,257 --> 01:02:36,635
I keep this place
for socializing.

742
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:40,138
Someday we'll get a couple of
broads, huh? Have a little party.

743
01:02:46,228 --> 01:02:48,480
Make some ice.
Booze is right over here.

744
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:55,696
So what do you think, Frank?
About the money?

745
01:02:56,321 --> 01:02:58,490
Look, Don...

746
01:02:58,573 --> 01:03:02,994
if I was broke, if I had a family-
I don't know.

747
01:03:03,078 --> 01:03:05,038
But I'm not broke,
and I don't have a family.

748
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,457
So why the fuck stick my neck out?

749
01:03:07,499 --> 01:03:10,585
It's already out, Frank-
not taking the money.

750
01:03:10,669 --> 01:03:12,838
It's better the other guys
don't know that.

751
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:14,840
Hey, I tell you what I'll do.

752
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,093
I'll hold your share
for you, huh?

753
01:03:18,176 --> 01:03:21,138
You change your mind,
it'll be right in here.

754
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:23,598
Right in here,
right down to the penny, huh?

755
01:03:23,682 --> 01:03:25,767
Hey. Look at that.

756
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:29,229
- What are you drinking?
- Give me a scotch.

757
01:03:32,649 --> 01:03:35,569
Next thing I wanna do, I wanna
get a color TV for the games.

758
01:03:35,652 --> 01:03:39,072
Hey, how about some gin?
Penny a point. Huh?

759
01:03:55,756 --> 01:03:57,841
Yeah.
Let me ask him first.

760
01:04:06,683 --> 01:04:08,602
Hello, Frank.
Get in.

761
01:04:16,818 --> 01:04:18,403
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.

762
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:22,699
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.

763
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,785
No, absolutely not.

764
01:04:24,868 --> 01:04:26,828
All right, all right.

765
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:33,293
I notified Commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

766
01:04:33,377 --> 01:04:37,422
He wants you to stay where you are
and continue to collect information.

767
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,217
Then you'll be
his eyes and his ears.

768
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,636
He said he was delighted
that, quote...

769
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:46,056
"A man of integrity
had surfaced," unquote.

770
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,810
When do I hear from him?

771
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:53,021
He said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

772
01:04:55,482 --> 01:04:56,900
Reach out?

773
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:01,697
See, you know, my situation's
pretty fuckin' sticky up there.

774
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,990
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait for him...

775
01:05:04,074 --> 01:05:06,702
- You must have patience, Frank.
- But it's pretty fucking sticky.

776
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:08,328
Patience and faith.

777
01:05:08,412 --> 01:05:11,748
When a man like the commissioner
says he'll get in touch with you...

778
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:13,750
he'll get in touch with you.

779
01:05:15,502 --> 01:05:17,170
Good-bye, son.
God bless you.

780
01:05:32,185 --> 01:05:34,813
All right, now.
Marinda's too hot.

781
01:05:34,896 --> 01:05:37,482
We got to lay off him
for a couple of months.

782
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:40,152
And listen, Falco's got two runners
he ain't paying for.

783
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:43,155
Check that fucking guy out, huh?
Hey, Frankie, how are you?

784
01:05:43,238 --> 01:05:46,283
- How are you?
- Rubello's being transferred...

785
01:05:46,324 --> 01:05:48,201
so you're gonna have to work
with a new bagman.

786
01:05:48,285 --> 01:05:51,830
Al Sarno, I want you to meet Frank
Serpico. This'll be your new man.

787
01:05:51,913 --> 01:05:53,498
- How are you?
- Fine.

788
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:56,626
Listen, you know that operation
down by Hunt's Point, the new one?

789
01:05:56,668 --> 01:05:58,795
What are we gonna do about that?
Who are we givin' to?

790
01:05:58,879 --> 01:06:01,423
You the new bagman,
you prick?

791
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:05,844
What happened to Rubello, you son
of a bitch? You narco cop fucker!

792
01:06:05,927 --> 01:06:07,846
Wait a minute.

793
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:22,527
You know, Frank,
sometimes I ask myself...

794
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:24,780
what the fuck am I doing?

795
01:06:26,823 --> 01:06:29,451
You know,
if this ever came out...

796
01:06:29,534 --> 01:06:31,495
Christ, my family.

797
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:34,498
My daughter.

798
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:38,251
She just started
with the San Francisco Opera.

799
01:06:38,335 --> 01:06:39,669
Chorus.

800
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:42,839
Took a lot of money.

801
01:06:44,383 --> 01:06:46,843
I once tried to pull out.

802
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:49,096
Christ, they were all over me.

803
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:51,223
So you...

804
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:53,225
just go along.

805
01:06:57,062 --> 01:06:59,606
Unless you're willing
to go back to uniform duty.

806
01:07:17,624 --> 01:07:19,835
Shit.
How the money rolls in.

807
01:07:21,169 --> 01:07:24,631
- Here. Let me give you yours now.
- I'm not on.

808
01:07:25,632 --> 01:07:27,968
- What do you mean, you're not on?
- Just what I said.

809
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:30,637
I'm not on.
I don't take money.

810
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,181
- Some gag. Here.
- No, I told you straight.

811
01:07:34,224 --> 01:07:36,810
I don't take money,
and that's the truth.

812
01:07:38,895 --> 01:07:41,857
- What were you doing with Rubello?
- Ask Rubello.

813
01:07:45,569 --> 01:07:48,030
Your nut-
where's it been going?

814
01:07:48,113 --> 01:07:49,656
Ask Rubello.

815
01:07:52,242 --> 01:07:54,369
All right, then, sir.
I'll go to Delaney myselfthen.

816
01:07:54,453 --> 01:07:58,040
- That would not be advisable.
- You don't understand, Captain.

817
01:07:58,123 --> 01:08:01,793
- It's been weeks. Not a word.
- I understand perfectly.

818
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:04,337
No, but, Captain,
now they know I'm not on.

819
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:06,673
I've done all I can do.
Good-bye, Frank.

820
01:08:12,137 --> 01:08:15,265
He's out.
Won't do another fucking thing.

821
01:08:16,808 --> 01:08:19,519
Blair, I'm telling you, nothing's
gonna happen from the inside.

822
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:21,897
The top guys have been
cops too long.

823
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,859
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?

824
01:08:25,942 --> 01:08:27,611
No, not a fucking word.

825
01:08:34,576 --> 01:08:36,411
Would you be willing to go
outside the department?

826
01:08:37,412 --> 01:08:39,206
Where could we go?

827
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:42,709
Would you believe
the mayor's office?

828
01:08:51,218 --> 01:08:53,387
- The mayor's office?
- His right-hand man...

829
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:56,181
guy named Jerry Berman,
from Princeton.

830
01:08:56,264 --> 01:08:58,975
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

831
01:08:59,059 --> 01:09:01,061
And he cares, Frank.
He really cares.

832
01:09:05,565 --> 01:09:07,818
- You know what we're doing?
- Yeah.

833
01:09:07,901 --> 01:09:10,737
- We're going outside the department.
- That's right.

834
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:15,992
Dynamite.

835
01:09:16,076 --> 01:09:19,204
Every plainclothes man
in the division...

836
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:21,581
and one,
maybe two lieutenants?

837
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:25,669
That is dynamite.
That is incredible.

838
01:09:25,752 --> 01:09:28,964
That is 150...

839
01:09:29,047 --> 01:09:32,092
That is $250,000 a year...

840
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:35,178
but that is just one precinct.

841
01:09:35,262 --> 01:09:37,931
Oh, that is amazing!

842
01:09:38,932 --> 01:09:42,561
See, what I feel is needed here
is, like, a real investigation.

843
01:09:42,644 --> 01:09:45,772
And I am sure that the mayor
will see this immediately.

844
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:48,692
McCIain and Delaney...

845
01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:51,236
they have done nothing?

846
01:09:51,278 --> 01:09:53,030
Oh, man.
That is amazing.

847
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:59,453
Another thing.
See, in a couple of days...

848
01:09:59,536 --> 01:10:01,121
they're gonna have
a meeting of the pad.

849
01:10:01,204 --> 01:10:02,456
Oh, right.

850
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:05,417
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that.

851
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:09,713
Rumors. See, I have heard rumors,
but never touching it directly.

852
01:10:09,796 --> 01:10:15,260
And for an on-the-line cop to come
forward like this is beautiful.

853
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:17,554
Really, Frank, I mean...

854
01:10:17,637 --> 01:10:20,515
you have my respect
and my sympathy...

855
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:22,517
for what you've been
going through, man.

856
01:10:22,559 --> 01:10:24,353
Wow.

857
01:10:29,107 --> 01:10:31,443
Hello.
This is Jerry Berman.

858
01:10:31,526 --> 01:10:34,279
Is he there?
All right. I'll hold on.

859
01:10:51,296 --> 01:10:52,756
Well?

860
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:56,551
Tell me what happened,
Paco.

861
01:10:56,593 --> 01:10:58,553
I'd like a drink.

862
01:11:04,017 --> 01:11:06,269
That guy is gonna
go to the mayor.

863
01:11:11,483 --> 01:11:13,443
To the mayor!

864
01:11:15,946 --> 01:11:18,323
Come here, Alfie. We're all
gonna go to the mayor together.

865
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,325
You know that?

866
01:11:23,954 --> 01:11:26,289
I couldn't be
any more embarrassed.

867
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,085
It's like a personal defeat.

868
01:11:31,795 --> 01:11:33,755
However...

869
01:11:33,797 --> 01:11:35,757
there are priorities.

870
01:11:35,799 --> 01:11:38,260
What are the priorities,
Jerry?

871
01:11:38,301 --> 01:11:40,429
The priorities are...

872
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,931
a long, hot summer ahead...

873
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:45,726
and riots are expected...

874
01:11:46,977 --> 01:11:50,981
and the mayor cannot
alienate the police force.

875
01:11:51,064 --> 01:11:53,859
Now, in the fall...

876
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:56,778
Now, in the fall,
it may be possible...

877
01:11:56,862 --> 01:11:58,780
to take another look
at the situation.

878
01:11:58,864 --> 01:12:00,657
All right, fine.
I'm sorry.

879
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:16,465
They're all rotten.

880
01:12:16,548 --> 01:12:18,633
Chickenshit.

881
01:12:18,717 --> 01:12:20,761
The whole fucking
system's corrupt.

882
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,851
- Who's there?
- It's me. I gotta talk to ya.

883
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:35,442
You know, Frank, you're behaving
like a goddamn child. You hear?

884
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,444
Let him in.

885
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,114
You let him in.

886
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:02,511
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

887
01:13:02,594 --> 01:13:05,680
Bullshit! I got me
into this whole thing.

888
01:13:07,057 --> 01:13:09,393
"Wow. Amazing!

889
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:13,313
"Dynamite!
Beautiful! Dynamite!

890
01:13:13,397 --> 01:13:15,315
Priorities. Priorities."

891
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:18,360
You and your big-deal friends,
your contacts...

892
01:13:18,402 --> 01:13:20,696
your big bullshit names.

893
01:13:20,779 --> 01:13:23,532
Bob Blair, the big operator
from Princeton.

894
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:26,576
The mystery man with the connections,
the hot line to the mayor.

895
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,787
Who the fuck do you think you are,
you son of a bitch?

896
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:31,623
You come looking for help,
whining, mealy-mouthed...

897
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:33,875
with your humble-pie act-
the saint, the injured innocent.

898
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:35,877
Who told you the department
or the whole world...

899
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:38,505
was some kind
of a fucking boy scout camp?

900
01:13:40,298 --> 01:13:44,886
What do you expect, for Christ's
sake, a magician? A big daddy?

901
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:48,390
White knight snaps his fingers,
the dirty world turns white...

902
01:13:48,473 --> 01:13:50,392
Just keep talking.
That's what you can do.

903
01:13:50,475 --> 01:13:52,936
while the Pope's choir sings
"Ave Maria," is that it?

904
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:56,148
You gonna blame me 'cause those
bastards don't wanna get involved?

905
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:59,026
I tried to help you.
I got my head handed to me.

906
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:01,820
Where's your head? It's on
your shoulders. That's what I see.

907
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:05,157
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit over here?

908
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,451
Get ready to blow up again,
'cause I got another idea.

909
01:14:07,492 --> 01:14:10,120
You and your ideas
are as full of shit as you are.

910
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:12,664
- Right on cue.
- Right on cue.

911
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,416
We can talk to Foreman,
the commissioner of investigations.

912
01:14:14,499 --> 01:14:17,127
Another guy!
We got another guy here.

913
01:14:17,169 --> 01:14:19,629
We could even talk to a guy
I know on the New York Times.

914
01:14:20,839 --> 01:14:24,509
Oh, that's terrific.
Go to the Times.

915
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,804
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.

916
01:14:27,888 --> 01:14:29,347
This is safe, Frank.

917
01:14:29,389 --> 01:14:31,224
It's safe? With my ass on the line,
it's safe, right?

918
01:14:31,308 --> 01:14:34,936
- Your ass is already on the line!
- That's my business!

919
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,064
- You don't trust me, Frank?
- I don't trust you!

920
01:14:37,147 --> 01:14:38,690
- Go fuckyourself!
- Fuckyou!

921
01:14:43,528 --> 01:14:45,489
Look, when I come home,
I want a house clean.

922
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:49,076
- Don't take it out on me, Paco.
- I don't want to pick up shit!

923
01:15:30,033 --> 01:15:32,035
Honey...

924
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:34,204
come to bed.

925
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:45,150
All right. Look, we all know
what this is about, right?

926
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:49,112
Frank, what the hell was happening
between you and Don Rubello?

927
01:16:52,115 --> 01:16:55,994
Simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.

928
01:16:56,078 --> 01:17:00,874
Rubello said if I changed my mind,
he'd hold my share...

929
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,502
he'd give it back to me.

930
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:06,129
- I didn't change my mind.
- The conniving bastard.

931
01:17:06,213 --> 01:17:09,925
- All right. I'll handle Rubello.
- Donny was stealing.

932
01:17:10,008 --> 01:17:13,720
I'll get back the money he took.
But this ain't gonna happen again.

933
01:17:13,804 --> 01:17:17,557
From now on, no more three bagmen.
Starting today, every one ofyou...

934
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:22,354
makes his own collections-
no stops, no bread, okay?

935
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,356
- Right.
- You got it.

936
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:28,568
What about you, Frankie?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

937
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:33,240
- Why should I start now?
- Everybody'd feel better about you.

938
01:17:33,323 --> 01:17:35,033
You can always give it
to charity.

939
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,621
Look, Frankie, what do you say,
a hundred a month just for expenses?

940
01:17:40,664 --> 01:17:44,251
For my secretary and my
business lunches, entertainment?

941
01:17:47,754 --> 01:17:52,300
All right. All right.
We split Frank's share from now on.

942
01:17:52,384 --> 01:17:54,344
You're a schmuck, Frank.

943
01:18:02,352 --> 01:18:04,813
If they would take
all that energy, see...

944
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:06,982
put it into
straight police work...

945
01:18:07,065 --> 01:18:08,442
we'd have the city
cleaned up in a week.

946
01:18:08,525 --> 01:18:10,944
They'd clean up.
There'd be no crime.

947
01:18:17,784 --> 01:18:20,620
If I could work alone-
That's the thing, see?

948
01:18:20,704 --> 01:18:23,373
If I could just get- Work alone.
But they don't like that.

949
01:18:23,457 --> 01:18:25,542
They don't want that.
They want to suckyou in.

950
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:28,378
You go over
the same thing, Paco.

951
01:18:28,462 --> 01:18:32,674
So fucking corrupt. Everybody,
everyone. Nobody giving a shit!

952
01:18:32,758 --> 01:18:35,927
There's gotta be a way
to wipe it out, goddamn it.

953
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:38,638
Let's get out of here for a while,
huh, honey? Let's go to a movie.

954
01:18:38,722 --> 01:18:42,184
Quit handling me! What are you
doing? How am I gonna go to a movie?

955
01:18:42,267 --> 01:18:45,729
They'd kill me if they knew!
You think that hasn't happened?

956
01:18:45,812 --> 01:18:49,649
Eitheryou're exploding, oryou're
Iying around like a catatonic!

957
01:18:49,733 --> 01:18:53,195
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

958
01:18:53,278 --> 01:18:56,573
All I care about is you!
That's all that matters to me.

959
01:18:56,615 --> 01:19:00,243
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this...

960
01:19:00,285 --> 01:19:03,705
Scared, miserable,
dreading to go to work.

961
01:19:03,789 --> 01:19:05,707
It's tearing me apart!

962
01:19:05,749 --> 01:19:09,336
And then I get sick of hearing
about it, and I start hating myself.

963
01:19:09,419 --> 01:19:13,256
You didn't like my being a cop,
so don't give me that shit.

964
01:19:13,298 --> 01:19:18,720
I love you! I want to marry you!
I want to have children with you!

965
01:19:18,804 --> 01:19:22,599
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Why don't you get out?

966
01:19:22,683 --> 01:19:26,687
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.

967
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:29,439
Well, do it.

968
01:19:42,661 --> 01:19:46,206
- What do you got?
- Would you bust whitey?

969
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:48,208
Try me. Try me.

970
01:19:49,209 --> 01:19:52,254
This guy's heavy.
He's Italian.

971
01:19:52,295 --> 01:19:56,007
Mobbed up.
Still interested?

972
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,927
Stop fuckin' around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

973
01:19:58,969 --> 01:20:03,557
He's a loan shark,
runs a big numbers operation.

974
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,143
This mother's so cocksure...

975
01:20:06,226 --> 01:20:09,479
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

976
01:20:09,563 --> 01:20:10,981
Where's the drop?

977
01:20:58,403 --> 01:20:59,654
Hold it!

978
01:20:59,738 --> 01:21:02,407
I'm a police officer.

979
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:03,825
And...

980
01:21:06,203 --> 01:21:08,997
Wait a minute.
You're under arrest.

981
01:21:10,457 --> 01:21:13,377
- I thought you were a junkie.
- I'll take that wad in your pocket.

982
01:21:15,587 --> 01:21:17,339
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know. I'm a joke.

983
01:21:17,422 --> 01:21:19,633
What are you doin'?
What's that?

984
01:21:21,134 --> 01:21:24,137
Put that away, oryou're in more
trouble. Give me your car keys.

985
01:21:29,935 --> 01:21:32,104
Where they been
hiding you, kid?

986
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:34,272
Wouldn't you like to know?

987
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:39,111
Hold this guy for booking.
Get a rap sheet on him.

988
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,154
I'm gonna search his car.

989
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:06,013
Where's Corsaro?

990
01:22:06,096 --> 01:22:08,015
Smith took him upstairs.

991
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:20,444
I swear to God, I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie.

992
01:22:22,946 --> 01:22:25,198
Listen, Rudy, you should
see some of the...

993
01:22:36,168 --> 01:22:38,545
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?

994
01:22:39,463 --> 01:22:42,758
You. Get over here
and empty your pockets.

995
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:46,094
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. Do what I say.

996
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:48,638
- Get over here.
- He's gonna get nasty about it.

997
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,475
You're fucking right!

998
01:22:51,558 --> 01:22:54,227
Hey, Frank, cool it, huh?

999
01:22:54,311 --> 01:22:56,938
Lean, motherfuck!
Spread!

1000
01:22:57,022 --> 01:22:59,358
Frank. Hey, Frank, Rudy's on.
He's good people.

1001
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:01,985
Stay the fuck outta this!

1002
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:05,030
You fuck!

1003
01:23:06,323 --> 01:23:08,450
What's this?
What's this?

1004
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:10,452
Get in! Get in!

1005
01:23:59,584 --> 01:24:03,296
Serpico.
Got that record check on Corsaro.

1006
01:24:18,103 --> 01:24:20,188
You want to read something?

1007
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:24,568
It's about your pal Corsaro.

1008
01:24:24,609 --> 01:24:27,404
Here, read it.
Read it!

1009
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:33,035
He did 15 years.
You know what for?

1010
01:24:33,118 --> 01:24:36,204
For killing a cop.
He's a fucking cop killer.

1011
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:50,010
- It's good to see you again.
- I've had it. I'm finished.

1012
01:24:50,093 --> 01:24:52,721
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it. I gotta get out.

1013
01:24:52,804 --> 01:24:55,349
If I have to go back to uniform,
I'm going back to uniform.

1014
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:59,019
I can't wait for Delaney to call.
I can't play their game anymore.

1015
01:24:59,061 --> 01:25:02,022
The commissioner didn't
get in touch with you?

1016
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:05,025
Not a word. No investigation,
no undercover work, nothing!

1017
01:25:05,108 --> 01:25:09,279
- I had no idea, Frank.
- It's only fair to tell you.

1018
01:25:09,363 --> 01:25:11,823
I've been to outside agencies.
I'll go to more if I have to.

1019
01:25:11,907 --> 01:25:14,076
What outside agencies?

1020
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:18,413
Holy Mother of God! Frank, we wash
our own laundry around here!

1021
01:25:18,455 --> 01:25:23,168
- You could be brought up on charges!
- We do not wash our own laundry!

1022
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:24,669
- It just gets dirtier!
- You are in trouble!

1023
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:27,881
I don't care if I'm in trouble.
I don't care who gets it.

1024
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:31,677
- If I have to go to outside agencies-
- Stay away from outside agencies!

1025
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,720
- Where am I gonna go?
- You hear me?

1026
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:36,014
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait until you hear from me.

1027
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:37,974
- I've been waiting for 11/2 years.
- I'll get back to you.

1028
01:25:38,058 --> 01:25:41,311
That's not enough!
Where am I gonna go?

1029
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:46,400
It's my life, you fuck!

1030
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:51,279
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.

1031
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,206
For this precinct,
cases reported...

1032
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:06,878
Murder- 14 for August,
20 for September, 23...

1033
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:11,216
Inspector Palmer?

1034
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:16,930
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1035
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:19,099
are waiting to see you.

1036
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:24,730
You want to come
to my office?

1037
01:26:30,902 --> 01:26:33,280
Captain McCIain called me.

1038
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:35,449
I briefed Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

1039
01:26:35,532 --> 01:26:37,993
on your allegations.

1040
01:26:38,076 --> 01:26:42,622
The question is, in all these
months, why didn't you come to us?

1041
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:46,626
Well...

1042
01:26:49,421 --> 01:26:52,716
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir, and...

1043
01:26:52,799 --> 01:26:55,218
you told...

1044
01:26:55,302 --> 01:26:57,888
I mean,
you told Captain McCIain...

1045
01:26:57,929 --> 01:27:00,390
that the division was as clean
as a hound's tooth.

1046
01:27:00,474 --> 01:27:04,186
You think you're the only honest cop
on the force, Serpico?

1047
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:06,355
My record's clear.

1048
01:27:06,438 --> 01:27:08,565
Inspector Gilbert's just
come from the commissioner's...

1049
01:27:08,648 --> 01:27:10,567
confidential
investigation unit.

1050
01:27:11,818 --> 01:27:14,488
Then you must have
heard something. I mean...

1051
01:27:16,865 --> 01:27:18,283
I don't understand.

1052
01:27:18,367 --> 01:27:20,994
Commissioner Delaney has known
about this from the beginning.

1053
01:27:23,455 --> 01:27:25,874
No, I didn't hear a thing.

1054
01:27:25,957 --> 01:27:29,127
But I understand
your frustration, Frank...

1055
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:31,296
believe me.

1056
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,508
I mean, it's sort of like
trying to punch your way...

1057
01:27:34,591 --> 01:27:36,677
out of a paper bag,
right?

1058
01:27:40,013 --> 01:27:42,432
What outside agencies
have you been to, Frank?

1059
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:52,859
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

1060
01:27:54,486 --> 01:27:57,739
We ought to ask Serpico directly
if he's gonna cooperate or not.

1061
01:27:57,823 --> 01:27:59,741
- Come on.
- We've gotta know...

1062
01:27:59,825 --> 01:28:02,285
if there's any real basis
for an investigation.

1063
01:28:05,205 --> 01:28:07,165
Well, I...

1064
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:09,292
I'll have to think that...

1065
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:11,878
I'm gonna have to think
about that.

1066
01:28:11,962 --> 01:28:15,090
What is there
to think about?

1067
01:28:15,173 --> 01:28:17,884
I don't see how the division
can investigate itself, sir.

1068
01:28:20,012 --> 01:28:22,931
You've got a point there.

1069
01:28:22,973 --> 01:28:26,810
But you would cooperate with
an impartial investigation, right?

1070
01:28:29,688 --> 01:28:34,484
Yeah. Up to a point.
As long as I'm not involved.

1071
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:39,614
I just want to go someplace
where I can do my job.

1072
01:28:39,698 --> 01:28:42,284
That's fair enough.

1073
01:28:42,325 --> 01:28:44,286
We'll be in touch.

1074
01:28:48,457 --> 01:28:50,375
Inspector Palmer?

1075
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:52,544
May I see you a minute?

1076
01:28:57,924 --> 01:29:00,010
Was it necessary to let everyone
in the station house...

1077
01:29:00,093 --> 01:29:02,846
know I was comin' in here
to see these guys?

1078
01:29:02,929 --> 01:29:05,265
You believe from what you now know
that a full-scale investigation...

1079
01:29:05,349 --> 01:29:06,725
is warranted?

1080
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,479
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.

1081
01:29:14,775 --> 01:29:16,943
But, sir...

1082
01:29:17,027 --> 01:29:19,529
shouldn't headquarters
handle something like this?

1083
01:29:20,447 --> 01:29:24,368
No.
You're all experienced men.

1084
01:29:26,453 --> 01:29:28,830
Chief Gallagher here will be
available for consultation.

1085
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:36,296
Commissioner...

1086
01:29:38,965 --> 01:29:42,678
Serpico claims that...

1087
01:29:42,761 --> 01:29:46,014
McCIain talked to you about
this whole thing some time ago.

1088
01:29:46,098 --> 01:29:49,851
Yes. I seem to remember
something about that.

1089
01:29:54,523 --> 01:29:59,152
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park."

1090
01:29:59,236 --> 01:30:01,238
We need a location!

1091
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:04,199
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off.

1092
01:30:04,241 --> 01:30:07,911
Now, what do you want? The whole
thing signed, sealed, delivered?

1093
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:10,831
You're conducting this
investigation, not me.

1094
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,958
Lieutenant Smith-
Let's get back to him.

1095
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:17,379
Lieutenant Smith.
Lieutenant Smith said to me...

1096
01:30:17,462 --> 01:30:21,258
if I didn't want the money that
he would stash it in his attic.

1097
01:30:22,009 --> 01:30:23,427
I'll have him transferred
in the morning.

1098
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:26,304
Fuck him.
How about transferring me?

1099
01:30:38,859 --> 01:30:40,861
I hear you been
vouchering pad money...

1100
01:30:40,944 --> 01:30:44,740
over to a confidential
investigation squad.

1101
01:30:44,823 --> 01:30:49,327
Oh, yeah? How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

1102
01:30:49,369 --> 01:30:51,329
You won't find anything
on Serpico.

1103
01:30:54,249 --> 01:30:56,376
He's clean.

1104
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,919
Right?

1105
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:02,966
You practicing your frisk?

1106
01:31:06,428 --> 01:31:09,014
I'm looking to buy
a used tape recorder.

1107
01:31:12,225 --> 01:31:15,896
They're feeling me up every day.
How am I gonna wear a wire?

1108
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:17,397
Come on, Frank.

1109
01:31:17,481 --> 01:31:22,527
Wearing a wire means testifying to
corroborate the tape, right? Right.

1110
01:31:22,569 --> 01:31:25,572
I'm not testifying.

1111
01:31:25,655 --> 01:31:27,824
I gotta put a dime
in the parking meter.

1112
01:31:27,908 --> 01:31:31,370
Ragland, put a dime
in the parking meter for Serpico.

1113
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:41,296
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, district attorney?

1114
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,798
Yeah, I watch television.

1115
01:31:42,881 --> 01:31:47,260
Frank, I want to compliment you
for coming forward like this.

1116
01:31:47,344 --> 01:31:49,262
It's unique.

1117
01:31:49,346 --> 01:31:53,350
It's uniquely unique.
You should be proud of yourself.

1118
01:31:53,433 --> 01:31:56,478
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shitheels...

1119
01:31:56,561 --> 01:31:59,773
with Frank Serpico
as my star witness.

1120
01:31:59,856 --> 01:32:03,402
Mr. Tauber, you and everybody
in this room can go to hell...

1121
01:32:03,485 --> 01:32:04,903
'cause I'm not testifying.

1122
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:08,073
- Listen-
- Wait just a second, Frank.

1123
01:32:08,156 --> 01:32:10,492
You have nothing to fear.
You're not gonna be singled out.

1124
01:32:10,575 --> 01:32:12,911
I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows...

1125
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:14,746
- Wait a minute-
- if it meant something...

1126
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:17,207
- but this investigation is bullshit.
- Mind if I say something?

1127
01:32:17,249 --> 01:32:20,001
Bullshit. You're not going after
corruption in the department...

1128
01:32:20,085 --> 01:32:21,795
the division, the Bronx.

1129
01:32:21,878 --> 01:32:23,797
A few flunky cops
thrown to the wolves...

1130
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,925
to protect Delaney and those guys
who've known about this for years...

1131
01:32:27,009 --> 01:32:29,886
and won't do a fuckin' thing about
it, that's why I won't testify.

1132
01:33:04,254 --> 01:33:08,508
- Hey, what's this?
- Exactly what it says.

1133
01:33:08,592 --> 01:33:10,177
I'm splitting.

1134
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,346
"Splitting." I never read
anything so stupid in my life.

1135
01:33:12,429 --> 01:33:15,766
"I'm leaving. If you want to
discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."

1136
01:33:15,807 --> 01:33:18,018
I didn't feel like another
blood-and-guts scene.

1137
01:33:18,101 --> 01:33:20,062
I figured you wouldn't
be able to shout in here.

1138
01:33:20,103 --> 01:33:22,189
I can shout anywhere!

1139
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:29,279
I won't shout.

1140
01:33:30,906 --> 01:33:32,449
Sit down, sit down.

1141
01:33:45,754 --> 01:33:47,839
It's just gonna go on
and on, Paco.

1142
01:33:47,923 --> 01:33:50,008
It isn't gonna
get any better.

1143
01:33:51,635 --> 01:33:54,429
And if you quit,
somehow I'll be blamed.

1144
01:34:03,605 --> 01:34:05,732
How could you leave
the man you love...

1145
01:34:06,817 --> 01:34:08,902
future father of your kids?

1146
01:34:11,738 --> 01:34:14,366
You never said anything
like that to me before.

1147
01:34:16,034 --> 01:34:19,788
And if I come back,
you won't say it again.

1148
01:34:22,082 --> 01:34:25,585
You want to be free
and unattached...

1149
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:29,089
to go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

1150
01:34:29,172 --> 01:34:30,590
My cause.

1151
01:34:35,762 --> 01:34:37,347
I felt so safe with you...

1152
01:34:38,724 --> 01:34:40,726
so loving.

1153
01:34:50,402 --> 01:34:51,820
Stay with me, Laurie.

1154
01:34:55,157 --> 01:34:57,075
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No, no.

1155
01:35:08,879 --> 01:35:12,341
- What do I owe you for that?
- Excuse me.

1156
01:35:12,424 --> 01:35:14,343
Here.

1157
01:35:14,426 --> 01:35:15,844
Here's $2:00.

1158
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,238
What are you doing?

1159
01:35:39,826 --> 01:35:41,286
Do you want to walk away,
or should I?

1160
01:35:43,121 --> 01:35:44,539
I'm not gonna walk away.

1161
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,001
It's finished!

1162
01:35:56,009 --> 01:35:59,429
Who do you think you are, trying to
pull that "no testifying" bullshit on me?

1163
01:35:59,471 --> 01:36:03,266
Chief Green,
I know your reputation.

1164
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:07,646
Look, maybe if you were borough
commanderwhen this thing started...

1165
01:36:07,688 --> 01:36:11,108
run this investigation yourself,
I'd feel different about testifying.

1166
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:13,485
But the truth is,
you're coming in after the fact.

1167
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:17,906
You're like a quiffwho says
she won't, then maybe she will.

1168
01:36:17,989 --> 01:36:20,575
I'm like a quiff
who's been fucked over...

1169
01:36:20,659 --> 01:36:24,579
for a year and a half by guys like
Kellogg, McCIain, Delaney...

1170
01:36:24,663 --> 01:36:27,582
I'm not Kellogg,
McCIain or Delaney!

1171
01:36:27,666 --> 01:36:30,460
Frank, it won't be
just flunky cops.

1172
01:36:30,544 --> 01:36:33,255
This is only the beginning.
This could be the biggest thing...

1173
01:36:33,338 --> 01:36:36,508
- since the Harry Gross case.
- And meanwhile, where am I?

1174
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:39,052
I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?

1175
01:36:39,136 --> 01:36:41,888
I'm totally isolated in the
department. I don't have a friend.

1176
01:36:41,972 --> 01:36:45,475
Don't give me that bullshit. I've
been puttin' cops away for 30 years!

1177
01:36:45,517 --> 01:36:48,979
My name's an obscenity on every
precinct shithouse wall in the city.

1178
01:36:49,062 --> 01:36:52,899
- I've observed that, sir.
- Friends! I fought my way up...

1179
01:36:52,983 --> 01:36:54,651
as a Jew in the department in the
days you were supposed to have...

1180
01:36:54,735 --> 01:36:57,446
an uncircumcised shamrock
between your legs.

1181
01:36:57,529 --> 01:36:59,364
I have this nightmare
I'm on 5th Avenue...

1182
01:36:59,448 --> 01:37:01,992
watching the St. Patrick's Day
parade and I have a coronary...

1183
01:37:02,075 --> 01:37:05,203
and 9,000 cops
march happily over my body.

1184
01:37:05,287 --> 01:37:08,206
Friends. I haven't got a friend
on the force, either, Serpico.

1185
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:10,667
- I'll be your friend, Chief.
- I'm not lookin' for any.

1186
01:37:10,709 --> 01:37:13,628
- I'll make an exception for you.
- Frank, you're a good cop.

1187
01:37:13,754 --> 01:37:16,840
Stop being a prima donna.
Cut out the shtickklech.

1188
01:37:16,923 --> 01:37:19,051
I don't understand.

1189
01:37:19,134 --> 01:37:21,094
How am I being a prima donna?
I want to protect myself.

1190
01:37:23,597 --> 01:37:27,267
We're gonna get the indictments.
You're gonna have to testify.

1191
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:39,237
Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.

1192
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:42,115
Ready on the firing line.

1193
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:33,709
What are you gonna tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

1194
01:38:35,919 --> 01:38:38,046
Depends on
what they ask me.

1195
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:40,590
Suppose they ask you
who's taking money?

1196
01:38:40,674 --> 01:38:42,926
What I don't know,
I don't know.

1197
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:45,721
But you do know, Frank.

1198
01:38:45,804 --> 01:38:49,808
Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't
want to see anything happen to you.

1199
01:38:49,891 --> 01:38:54,229
But you gotta understand,
a lot of people could get hurt here.

1200
01:38:54,271 --> 01:38:57,858
I'm not saying anything's going to
happen. I'm saying it could happen.

1201
01:38:57,941 --> 01:39:00,736
I mean, there's lots ofways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.

1202
01:39:00,777 --> 01:39:02,946
They can just not be there
when you need them.

1203
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:06,241
Somebody come at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

1204
01:39:06,324 --> 01:39:08,410
Or they can send you
in first enough times...

1205
01:39:08,493 --> 01:39:10,704
until finally one day you're gonna
walk in the wrong door.

1206
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:17,210
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank!

1207
01:39:20,505 --> 01:39:23,091
I have nothing more. Does anyone
have any further questions?

1208
01:39:24,176 --> 01:39:26,428
- Yes, Mrs. Crist?
- If I may, Mr. Knowles, thank you.

1209
01:39:26,511 --> 01:39:29,181
Officer Serpico came
to the 7th Division...

1210
01:39:29,264 --> 01:39:31,183
more than a year
and a half ago.

1211
01:39:31,266 --> 01:39:34,603
All during that time, the things
he's told us were taking place.

1212
01:39:34,686 --> 01:39:37,356
Now, why didn't
Officer Serpico...

1213
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:41,485
report these criminal activities
when he first encountered them?

1214
01:39:41,568 --> 01:39:44,738
- I'd like to answer that.
- Mr. Chairman...

1215
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:49,534
Mrs. Crist's question isn't material
or relevant to the present inquiry.

1216
01:39:49,618 --> 01:39:51,828
- Although I want to make it clear...
- I'd like to answer that.

1217
01:39:51,912 --> 01:39:55,499
Officer Serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way...

1218
01:39:55,582 --> 01:39:57,876
or guilty of
any infraction of the law.

1219
01:39:57,959 --> 01:39:59,878
Quite the contrary.

1220
01:39:59,961 --> 01:40:03,465
The District Attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

1221
01:40:03,548 --> 01:40:06,968
Very well. Officer Serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

1222
01:40:07,052 --> 01:40:10,055
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1223
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,601
Why didn't you tell him
about Delaney and Kellogg?

1224
01:40:14,685 --> 01:40:17,479
Frank, this was a grand jury
about police officers...

1225
01:40:17,562 --> 01:40:20,232
actively engaged in corruption.

1226
01:40:20,315 --> 01:40:22,943
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

1227
01:40:23,026 --> 01:40:26,988
That's crap and you know it, because
even a dumb cop like me knows...

1228
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:30,617
a prosecutor can take a grand jury
anywhere it wants to take it.

1229
01:40:30,701 --> 01:40:33,412
Now, you never led me anywhere
near the real problems...

1230
01:40:33,453 --> 01:40:36,748
Nothing about the bosses,
the brass...

1231
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:39,668
how corruption like this could exist
without anybody knowing about it.

1232
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:42,337
Now, a few flunky cops
in the Bronx. That's it.

1233
01:40:42,421 --> 01:40:45,090
None of the shit in Queens,
Brooklyn, Manhattan?

1234
01:40:45,173 --> 01:40:47,092
While you're at it,
why don't you mention Kansas City?

1235
01:40:47,134 --> 01:40:49,553
Well, "the biggest thing since
Harry Gross." That's what you said.

1236
01:40:49,636 --> 01:40:52,055
All right! Look, Frank.

1237
01:40:52,931 --> 01:40:55,892
You got guts, integrity.

1238
01:40:55,976 --> 01:40:58,937
There's going to be a detective's
gold shield in this for you.

1239
01:41:01,648 --> 01:41:05,110
Now, that's terrific.
That's good.

1240
01:41:05,193 --> 01:41:06,778
Maybe this is
what it's all about.

1241
01:41:06,862 --> 01:41:08,739
Maybe I should take my
gold shield and forget it.

1242
01:41:08,822 --> 01:41:11,116
I know you've been through
an ordeal, Frank.

1243
01:41:13,869 --> 01:41:17,372
I'm a marked man in this department.
For what?

1244
01:41:17,456 --> 01:41:20,792
- I've already arranged a transfer.
- To where? China?

1245
01:41:32,721 --> 01:41:35,474
That takes a 14-shot clip.

1246
01:41:35,557 --> 01:41:37,601
You expecting an army?

1247
01:41:37,642 --> 01:41:39,603
No, just a division.

1248
01:41:41,521 --> 01:41:46,068
Tauber, did you know I've had
reports about Serpico being a fag?

1249
01:41:46,151 --> 01:41:48,820
He used to hang out
in the BCI washroom.

1250
01:41:48,904 --> 01:41:52,115
That's stupid, Commissioner,
and you know it.

1251
01:41:52,199 --> 01:41:56,286
Mr. Commissioner, a gold shield
for Serpico at this time...

1252
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:57,954
would convince
a lot of people...

1253
01:41:58,038 --> 01:41:59,581
Not while I'm commissioner.

1254
01:42:18,809 --> 01:42:20,227
Commander's office?

1255
01:42:22,688 --> 01:42:24,648
It's down that corridor.

1256
01:42:27,609 --> 01:42:30,362
Hey, Serpico. Do you know what
they're saying in the Bronx?

1257
01:42:30,445 --> 01:42:33,323
That you spilled your
guts to the grand jury.

1258
01:42:34,324 --> 01:42:36,284
Say it isn't so, Serpico.

1259
01:42:38,453 --> 01:42:40,122
It isn't so.

1260
01:42:41,206 --> 01:42:43,291
We know how to handle
guys like you.

1261
01:42:44,543 --> 01:42:46,503
I ought to cut
your tongue out.

1262
01:42:52,342 --> 01:42:54,052
Don't move.

1263
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:18,410
Officer Serpico
reporting for duty, sir.

1264
01:43:26,668 --> 01:43:29,671
I'm Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.

1265
01:43:31,465 --> 01:43:33,675
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

1266
01:43:35,427 --> 01:43:36,887
Anybody in this command
you want to work with?

1267
01:43:40,474 --> 01:43:44,186
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

1268
01:43:47,022 --> 01:43:50,609
All right. You can't find anybody
you want to work with, Frank...

1269
01:43:50,692 --> 01:43:52,903
I'll work with you.

1270
01:43:52,986 --> 01:43:54,905
Is that all right?

1271
01:44:05,624 --> 01:44:07,626
How do we get past
the lookouts?

1272
01:44:07,709 --> 01:44:09,419
How many you got?
One.

1273
01:44:11,963 --> 01:44:14,591
There's two.

1274
01:44:14,675 --> 01:44:17,469
- Yeah, there's a guy.
- There's three of them.

1275
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:19,721
It's four buildings away. We could
try to get down the fire escape.

1276
01:44:19,805 --> 01:44:21,890
Get in behind him.
What do you think?

1277
01:44:23,517 --> 01:44:25,852
- Look good to you?
- Yeah, let's go.

1278
01:45:08,895 --> 01:45:10,981
What do you think?
Want to try it?

1279
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:31,710
- Oh, boy.
- You all right?

1280
01:45:31,752 --> 01:45:33,712
Yeah. I feel just
like a cop again.

1281
01:45:33,754 --> 01:45:36,048
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1282
01:46:04,451 --> 01:46:06,036
Close up!

1283
01:46:08,872 --> 01:46:10,874
Wait, Frank!

1284
01:46:10,957 --> 01:46:12,417
Come on!

1285
01:46:21,843 --> 01:46:23,261
I ain't got nothing!

1286
01:46:25,472 --> 01:46:27,432
Beat it, fuck face!

1287
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:32,062
Get the other one! Get out of here!
Get up against the wall.

1288
01:46:35,941 --> 01:46:38,235
What the hell's goin' on here?
Who the hell are you?

1289
01:46:38,276 --> 01:46:40,112
- Who are you?
- The police! Who the hell you think?

1290
01:46:40,195 --> 01:46:42,823
Get the fuck against the wall.
Up, up, up!

1291
01:46:42,906 --> 01:46:46,576
- Let me see your shield.
- All right. There's my shield.

1292
01:46:46,618 --> 01:46:49,287
- Where are you from?
- The borough. Manhattan 8th.

1293
01:46:49,371 --> 01:46:52,499
No, goddamn it! I just paid
the borough this morning!

1294
01:46:55,085 --> 01:46:56,753
What the hell kind of
shakedown is this?

1295
01:46:56,837 --> 01:46:58,922
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1296
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:03,093
Nobody.
I didn't pay no...

1297
01:47:03,135 --> 01:47:05,220
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

1298
01:47:05,303 --> 01:47:08,473
I didn't pay nobody.
Now let go of me.

1299
01:47:09,516 --> 01:47:14,104
We followed up,
and there's no doubt about it.

1300
01:47:14,187 --> 01:47:17,607
The pad here in Manhattan
is bigger...

1301
01:47:17,649 --> 01:47:22,404
and it's more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

1302
01:47:22,487 --> 01:47:25,490
The pickups here are made-
You want to get this...

1303
01:47:25,574 --> 01:47:28,785
The pickups are made by...

1304
01:47:28,869 --> 01:47:31,747
retired policemen.

1305
01:47:31,788 --> 01:47:35,292
That way, no plainclothesmen
are directly involved.

1306
01:47:35,375 --> 01:47:39,629
Now, we need investigative help
on this one, Chief.

1307
01:47:41,465 --> 01:47:45,844
If you need investigative help
and you don't trust your own men...

1308
01:47:45,927 --> 01:47:48,930
why don't you requisition some
recruits from the police academy?

1309
01:47:57,230 --> 01:47:58,815
With all due respect,
sir...

1310
01:48:00,859 --> 01:48:03,779
backing us up is the only hope
the police department has got.

1311
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:07,491
Good cops would come forward if they
thought there was encouragement...

1312
01:48:07,574 --> 01:48:09,910
in the department to do so, and if
they thought it would do any good.

1313
01:48:09,951 --> 01:48:11,912
If there's no encouragement,
they're not gonna do it.

1314
01:48:11,995 --> 01:48:15,540
I've done a lot more than most
people to defend and preserve...

1315
01:48:15,624 --> 01:48:19,044
the image of this department
and protect Commissioner Delaney...

1316
01:48:19,127 --> 01:48:23,006
against reckless and irresponsible
assaults from outside agencies.

1317
01:48:24,925 --> 01:48:26,843
That's it, huh?

1318
01:48:26,927 --> 01:48:30,597
I mean, that's what's
really important, isn't it?

1319
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:32,766
That's what
you want to know...

1320
01:48:32,849 --> 01:48:36,103
what outside agencies
I've been to, right?

1321
01:48:37,646 --> 01:48:39,398
- Hello.
- Hello, prick.

1322
01:48:39,481 --> 01:48:41,608
- Who is this?
- Frank.

1323
01:48:42,484 --> 01:48:45,445
- How are you? Where are you?
- I'm ready to go to the Times.

1324
01:48:46,405 --> 01:48:50,492
It's a goddamn
serious step, Frank.

1325
01:48:50,575 --> 01:48:53,161
I don't know if
the timing is right.

1326
01:48:55,872 --> 01:48:58,667
Look, I want it to get on
the record, that's all...

1327
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:01,169
in case something
should happen to me.

1328
01:49:04,715 --> 01:49:06,800
I want it on the record.

1329
01:49:09,845 --> 01:49:11,263
I don't know ifwe
carry enough weight.

1330
01:49:12,931 --> 01:49:15,017
I don't know if the New York Times
will go that far out on a limb...

1331
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:17,352
on the say-so
of two flunky cops.

1332
01:49:21,648 --> 01:49:24,401
Suppose an inspector
were to come with us?

1333
01:49:26,028 --> 01:49:29,448
You know, I got 20 years
on the force.

1334
01:49:29,489 --> 01:49:33,827
Just bought this place.
I signed a 500-year mortgage on it.

1335
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:37,122
- Turn that thing off out there!
- Come on. Everybody to bed.

1336
01:49:37,205 --> 01:49:39,249
- Aw, Mom!
- Turn that damn thing down!

1337
01:49:39,332 --> 01:49:41,251
Come on, now.
Go on upstairs.

1338
01:49:41,335 --> 01:49:43,378
You said we could go
to bed late!

1339
01:49:45,047 --> 01:49:47,966
This is against department
regulations, you both know that.

1340
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:52,346
If they want to throw the book
at me, they can do it.

1341
01:49:52,387 --> 01:49:54,473
If I left the force...

1342
01:49:55,849 --> 01:49:57,976
I don't know
what I could do.

1343
01:50:03,774 --> 01:50:07,694
Okay, I made my little speech.
I'll back you up a hundred percent.

1344
01:50:11,698 --> 01:50:14,910
Times and the News.
I got the money, fellas.

1345
01:50:14,993 --> 01:50:16,912
Here you go, here you go,
here you go.

1346
01:50:16,995 --> 01:50:18,413
Newsweek, please.

1347
01:50:20,832 --> 01:50:22,751
Holy sh- Jeez!

1348
01:50:25,087 --> 01:50:26,713
Aw, Christ!

1349
01:50:26,797 --> 01:50:29,675
You could almost predict
the numbers they're gonna do.

1350
01:50:29,716 --> 01:50:31,968
Delaney's gonna issue
some phony denial.

1351
01:50:32,052 --> 01:50:35,013
Somebody from the mayor's office
will say something noble.

1352
01:50:35,097 --> 01:50:39,726
Delaney'll change his tune. Finally,
the mayor will appoint a commission.

1353
01:50:39,810 --> 01:50:42,979
"Mayor Lindsay announced the
formation of a five-man committee...

1354
01:50:43,063 --> 01:50:45,899
to review the city procedures for
investigating police corruption."

1355
01:50:45,982 --> 01:50:49,027
How come I'm not
in the first paragraph?

1356
01:50:49,111 --> 01:50:50,529
Unbelievable!

1357
01:50:54,825 --> 01:50:59,204
The Times' report smells
of the familiar smear tactics...

1358
01:50:59,287 --> 01:51:01,289
of McCarthyism.

1359
01:51:01,373 --> 01:51:05,836
- I have issued a statement-
- We here at city hall...

1360
01:51:05,919 --> 01:51:08,630
The mayor appointed a special
investigation commission...

1361
01:51:08,714 --> 01:51:10,632
to be headed
by Whitman Knapp.

1362
01:51:10,716 --> 01:51:12,134
Yeah, come.

1363
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:22,644
It's your reward. It's a transfer
to narcotics, Brooklyn South.

1364
01:51:22,728 --> 01:51:25,856
You're still in clothes. You get
a tin shield, not a gold one.

1365
01:51:30,652 --> 01:51:32,571
I miss you already, Frank.

1366
01:51:37,617 --> 01:51:40,829
Look, Frank...

1367
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:46,209
it's narcotics.

1368
01:51:46,293 --> 01:51:48,837
You be careful.

1369
01:51:48,879 --> 01:51:52,382
It's very easy to get hurt...

1370
01:51:53,925 --> 01:51:55,344
and to...

1371
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,638
to be set up.

1372
01:52:40,681 --> 01:52:42,724
Get in.

1373
01:52:59,658 --> 01:53:01,743
You're not wired,
are you?

1374
01:53:02,869 --> 01:53:04,746
Okay, you cocksucker.

1375
01:53:06,248 --> 01:53:09,251
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit...

1376
01:53:09,334 --> 01:53:12,754
but down here,
800 a month is chicken feed.

1377
01:53:14,381 --> 01:53:17,134
Last week,
one dope dealer...

1378
01:53:17,217 --> 01:53:20,262
sent out these guys
making pickups.

1379
01:53:20,345 --> 01:53:22,848
40,000 each.

1380
01:53:22,931 --> 01:53:26,226
We let 'em collect it all,
and then hit 'em.

1381
01:53:26,309 --> 01:53:29,896
120,000 split four ways.

1382
01:53:30,939 --> 01:53:33,358
That's serious money.

1383
01:53:33,442 --> 01:53:36,987
And with that,
you don't fuck around.

1384
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:41,158
- I got the message.
- Good.

1385
01:53:41,950 --> 01:53:43,410
Now get the fuck out.

1386
01:53:50,083 --> 01:53:51,501
The guy's name is Limbo.

1387
01:53:51,585 --> 01:53:53,920
He just uses this place,
his girlfriend's brother's place.

1388
01:53:53,962 --> 01:53:56,548
He's a pusher- heroin.

1389
01:53:56,631 --> 01:53:58,884
- We'll drive around to the corner.
- Right.

1390
01:53:58,967 --> 01:54:02,637
You keep in sight out front. When
you spot somebody who's dirty...

1391
01:54:02,679 --> 01:54:04,765
take off your glasses
and wipe 'em.

1392
01:54:04,848 --> 01:54:07,392
- Got it?
- Right. Okay.

1393
01:55:15,752 --> 01:55:18,213
We stay around here very long,
we're gonna get spotted.

1394
01:55:18,296 --> 01:55:21,883
Well, Frank, why don't you
go up there and check it out?

1395
01:55:21,967 --> 01:55:25,262
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

1396
01:55:25,345 --> 01:55:28,056
I'll take you shopping.

1397
01:57:12,703 --> 01:57:14,162
Limbo.

1398
01:57:47,571 --> 01:57:49,322
Police. Freeze!

1399
01:57:49,406 --> 01:57:51,408
Police officer.
All right, up against the wall.

1400
01:57:51,491 --> 01:57:55,704
Get your hands up against that wall.
Get up. All right.

1401
01:57:55,787 --> 01:57:58,707
- Palms on the wall and spread 'em.
- Get those hands up!

1402
01:57:58,749 --> 01:58:00,834
- Come on. Spread 'em!
- Get your feet apart.

1403
01:58:01,877 --> 01:58:03,879
- I saw the buy.
- Let's get Limbo.Julio!

1404
01:58:03,962 --> 01:58:06,214
- You all right, baby?
- Yeah, yeah. I got 'em.

1405
01:59:10,278 --> 01:59:12,155
Police officer!

1406
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:24,251
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

1407
01:59:25,252 --> 01:59:27,379
Go down the fire escape!

1408
01:59:43,562 --> 01:59:47,232
Police! Throw out your guns
and come out with your hands up!

1409
02:00:21,475 --> 02:00:24,644
- Wait. What do you got here?
- It's Mr. and Mrs. Serpico, sir.

1410
02:00:24,728 --> 02:00:26,646
Okay. Go ahead.

1411
02:00:31,943 --> 02:00:34,905
- Where's our son?
- They're bringing him from X-ray.

1412
02:00:34,988 --> 02:00:37,449
- We want to see him.
- Just a few minutes.

1413
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:07,479
Mr. and Mrs. Serpico...

1414
02:01:07,562 --> 02:01:11,650
the news is better
than we expected.

1415
02:01:11,733 --> 02:01:16,029
Thank God the bullet
was a small caliber.

1416
02:01:16,113 --> 02:01:17,698
It didn't enter the brain...

1417
02:01:19,366 --> 02:01:21,451
or strike the spinal cord.

1418
02:01:22,953 --> 02:01:25,497
He's on the critical list...

1419
02:01:25,539 --> 02:01:28,750
but his condition
seems to be stable.

1420
02:01:30,085 --> 02:01:31,920
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

1421
02:02:05,871 --> 02:02:09,041
Stay out of there.
Didn't they tell you?

1422
02:02:09,124 --> 02:02:10,584
What?

1423
02:02:10,667 --> 02:02:14,046
The word is, don't talk to him.
He's no fuckin' good.

1424
02:02:23,889 --> 02:02:26,516
- How you doing, kid?
- Hello, Sid.

1425
02:02:33,231 --> 02:02:35,192
How are you?

1426
02:02:38,362 --> 02:02:40,781
You wanna read my fan mail?

1427
02:02:40,864 --> 02:02:42,783
Sure.

1428
02:02:42,866 --> 02:02:44,951
You're a big shot now, huh?

1429
02:03:13,188 --> 02:03:16,775
I want you to get those
fucking cops away from my door.

1430
02:03:27,577 --> 02:03:31,164
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

1431
02:03:31,248 --> 02:03:32,749
Naturally.

1432
02:03:37,587 --> 02:03:39,047
Heinemann and Julio
are cleared.

1433
02:03:39,089 --> 02:03:41,675
The three of you are up for
exceptional merit awards.

1434
02:03:43,218 --> 02:03:45,137
That's very funny.

1435
02:03:50,434 --> 02:03:52,894
That's very funny.

1436
02:03:54,146 --> 02:03:55,564
Francesco, you love me?

1437
02:03:57,899 --> 02:04:00,318
I always had a thing for you, Sid.
You know that.

1438
02:04:04,781 --> 02:04:06,867
Your gold shield's
come through.

1439
02:04:35,604 --> 02:04:37,564
What's this for?

1440
02:04:41,151 --> 02:04:43,862
For being an honest cop?

1441
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:49,409
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

1442
02:04:53,830 --> 02:04:56,792
You tell them
they can shove it.

1443
02:05:02,339 --> 02:05:04,216
I don't want it.

1444
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:44,589
Oh, well.

1445
02:05:49,761 --> 02:05:52,347
Well, Frank,
the facts are these.

1446
02:05:52,431 --> 02:05:56,059
You'll have to stay on leave
of absence for a few months.

1447
02:05:56,101 --> 02:05:59,980
In all probability, the hearing
in your left ear won't come back.

1448
02:06:00,063 --> 02:06:02,691
Two bullet fragments are still
lodged there in the bony portion.

1449
02:06:02,774 --> 02:06:04,401
One is very close to
the carotid artery...

1450
02:06:04,443 --> 02:06:07,237
andyou'll have to be checkked
from time to time.

1451
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:09,698
Your left side will
feel stiffioccasionally.

1452
02:06:10,866 --> 02:06:14,036
Once in a great while you may
experience some dizziness.

1453
02:06:14,119 --> 02:06:16,246
But in general,
you'll be okkay.

1454
02:06:34,681 --> 02:06:36,975
Through my appearance
here today...

1455
02:06:37,059 --> 02:06:40,062
I hope that police officers in
the future will not experience...

1456
02:06:40,145 --> 02:06:43,732
the same frustration and anxiety
that I was subjected to...

1457
02:06:43,815 --> 02:06:47,110
for the past five years
at the hands of my superiors...

1458
02:06:47,194 --> 02:06:50,113
because of my attempt
to report corruption.

1459
02:06:50,197 --> 02:06:54,951
I was made to feel that I had
burdened them with an unwanted task.

1460
02:06:55,035 --> 02:06:58,580
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist...

1461
02:06:58,664 --> 02:07:00,624
in which an honest police officer
can act...

1462
02:07:00,666 --> 02:07:05,337
without fear of ridicule
or reprisal from fellow officers.

1463
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:09,007
Police corruption cannot exist
unless it is at least tolerated...

1464
02:07:09,091 --> 02:07:11,218
at higher levels
in the department.

1465
02:07:11,301 --> 02:07:14,638
Therefore, the most important result
that can come from these hearings...

1466
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:18,809
is a conviction by police officers
that the department will change.

1467
02:07:19,643 --> 02:07:21,061
In order to ensure this...

1468
02:07:21,144 --> 02:07:24,106
an independent,
permanent investigative body...

1469
02:07:24,189 --> 02:07:27,984
dealing with police corruption,
like this commission, is essential.
