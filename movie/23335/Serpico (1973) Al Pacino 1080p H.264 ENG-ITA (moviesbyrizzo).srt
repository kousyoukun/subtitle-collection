- How about some cream chicken?
- Sounds good to me.

60
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,259
No, I think I'll have...
how about a roast beef on a roll?

61
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,767
Yeah, OK. You go through the line.
I'll bring it over.

Peluce, it's all fat here.

63

- Take it easy. Sit down.

64

- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

65
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:11,913
Well, I'm not fussy but I don't know
how I'm going to eat this.

Couldn't I pay for it, get what I want?

We take the collar.

entered the schoolyard without permission,

00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:28,279
You keep asking me that.
What's the matter with you? I'm doing OK.

156
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:31,240
I thought you were coming over
to the house Saturday night.

157
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,202
I'm sorry, Pasquale. I couldn't make it.

158
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:37,205
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed.

159
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,375
Nah, look. I don't like that.

160
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:43,544
I mean really, don't invite people over

161
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:46,464
if you're not sure
I'm gonna come. I mean it now.

162
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,799
If I want to see Marianne, I'll call her.

163
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:50,510
What's going on with you two?

164
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:55,223
Hey, Pasquale.
I'm going to tell you something.

165
00:19:56,724 --> 00:20:00,061
All day long I work with cops. Right?

166
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:02,688
Now when I go out, I see Marianne,

167
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:06,776
her father's a cop, her brother's a cop,
her uncle's a cop.

168
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,070
- I got a feeling she's a cop too.
- (Laughs)

169
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:12,573
Come here. How you doing on the job?

170
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,451
It's got its problems.

171
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:18,704
Mama tells me you are looking
for a new apartment. Is that true?

172
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:21,207
- Yeah.
- So, where are you going?

173
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,877
I don't know.
I'm looking around by the school.

174
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:28,381
- NYU? Greenwich Village?
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.

175
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:30,758
What's the matter?
This neighbourhood's not good enough?

176
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:32,969
Tell Pop I was here.

177
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:37,723
- Yeah. Frankie! Sunday?
- Sunday what?

178
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:39,976
Dinner. Huh?

179
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:44,188
- Do me one favour.
- I know, I know. No Marianne.

180
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:46,399
All right, a couple of announcements.

181
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:48,818
Announcing a course
in fingerprint identification

182
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,112
to be given at John Jay College.

183
00:20:51,237 --> 00:20:54,574
The course will be available to patrolmen
who wish to make themselves eligible

184
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:58,452
for assignment to
the Bureau of Criminal Identification, BCI,

185
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:01,998
which is generally considered to be a path
to a detective's gold shield.

186
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:04,750
Signed Captain McGuire.

187
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,253
On the board on my left,
you'll see Squad One...

188
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:15,052
- Hot enough for you?
- It's not the heat, it's the humidity.

189
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:17,805
I had a feeling you were going to say that.

190
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:40,453
You know how long you've taken on that one?

191
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:44,040
Check one print category. Two. That's plenty.

192
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:49,754
I'm not going to give a guy a "No Record"
when he might have a record.

193
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:52,506
How long have you been with the BCI, Serpico?

194
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:55,509
All my life.

195
00:21:56,427 --> 00:21:58,971
That's long enough to know how we do things.

196
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:03,100
Barto. It's not just that.

197
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:04,894
You don't like me.

198
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:08,814
BCI never had a weirdo cop before.

199
00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:12,610
Barto. Stop bugging me.

200
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:24,074
Mama?

201
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,500
I just remembered to give you something.

202
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,500
I did too.

203
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,000
What's this?

204
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Exactly what you're looking at there.

205
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:53,000
All the money we didn't need we put in the bank for you.

206
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,100
But why are you doing this?

207
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:08,500
It's to furnish a home for you. So you remember your mother.

208
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,479
(Sings in Italian)

209
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:54,545
♪ Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-ba ♪

210
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:04,847
Hey. Wanna buy a puppy?

211
00:24:15,024 --> 00:24:16,734
Well, now...

212
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:20,446
Where'd you get these dogs?

213
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:23,616
Oh, they're mine.

214
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:27,244
Want one for free?

215
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:31,081
Ah... no, I'll pay for it. How much are they?

216
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:32,875
Five dollars.

217
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:36,003
You got it.

218
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:44,053
OK. Which one of you guys
wants to come with me?

219
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,305
- (Whimpers)
- What?

220
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:49,975
Come on.

221
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:52,645
- Will you do me a favour?
- What?

222
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,481
Watch the car and my stuff over here
cos as I'm moving in?

223
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:57,817
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

224
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:30,724
(Speaks Spanish)

225
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,984
(Continues in Spanish)

226
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,535
Senorita Lane?

227
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:57,918
- Mr Serpico.
- I've got my horse here.

228
00:25:58,043 --> 00:26:01,630
- Maybe I could drop you somewhere.
- I'm going to work at the Cafe Reggie.

229
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:04,258
Cafe Reggie. That... erm...

230
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:09,805
- That's Fourth Street and...
- McDougall and Third.

231
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,475
- McDougall and Third. Can I give you a lift?
- Sure.

232
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:16,395
Jesus, what's that?

233
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,689
You've got your hands on my money belt.
Don't do that.

234
00:26:18,814 --> 00:26:21,108
That's not a money belt. That's a gun.

235
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:23,235
We've gotta eat, don't we?

236
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:28,908
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?

237
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,076
- Yeah.
- I'm their lion tamer.

238
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:33,078
- Come on.
- No, it's the truth.

239
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:35,456
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?

240
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:39,043
- What do you do?
- Oh, me? I'm an actress.

241
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:41,879
A singer, a dancer and a Buddhist.

242
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:43,297
In that order?

243
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:45,174
(Laughs)

244
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,845
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.

245
00:27:05,152 --> 00:27:06,946
(sings)

246
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,825
- Leslie. Leslie.
- Yep?

247
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:14,828
Those leaps that guy made.
What do you call them again?

248
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:16,789
- Jetes.
- Jetes?

249
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:18,332
Yeah.

250
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:23,629
You try it.

251
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:26,966
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?

252
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:29,009
Comme pa.

253
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:32,054
(She laughs)

254
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:34,556
Next life. Come on.

255
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:40,771
What are you reading now, Serpico?

256
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:46,652
<i>My Life, by Isadora Duncan.</i>

257
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:49,530
She was a ballet dancer.

258
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:51,532
A belly dancer?

259
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,954
No. A ballet dancer. Ballet.

260
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,249
You know ballet?

261
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:03,752
- A little.
- A little bit, huh? You ever see one?

262
00:28:03,877 --> 00:28:05,045
Not close.

263
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,172
I've been to the ballet. It's terrific.

264
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:09,967
- I've been taking classes, you know.
- Oh, yeah?

265
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,594
Yeah. That's where I go after I leave here.

266
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,556
Fantastic for your body.
It really builds you up.

267
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,850
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?

268
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:20,769
- I noticed.
- There's five positions, you know that?

269
00:28:20,894 --> 00:28:24,648
- Five? You're being short-changed.
- Oh, no, it's enough, believe me.

270
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:26,900
- For what?
- Watch.

271
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:30,279
See? This is the first position.

272
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:32,990
From this position, I can do anything.

273
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:34,700
- Want to see?
- Sure.

274
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,577
Here we go.

275
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:41,206
Bye!

276
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:46,462
- Lieutenant Steiger, I...
- No, no. Later.

277
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:55,888
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Oh, Potts, I wanted to read.

278
00:28:57,097 --> 00:29:02,019
Positions, positions. Positions like that
you don't see in a pretzel factory.

279
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:04,229
How am I going to do my pee-pee in the dark?

280
00:29:04,354 --> 00:29:07,066
She's got to be a nympho
with positions like that.

281
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:11,653
Serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

282
00:29:12,237 --> 00:29:13,739
Barto wants a specimen.

283
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:16,075
I'll look into this matter.

284
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,285
(Toilet flushes)

285
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,206
- What have you got there?
- Here.

286
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:25,584
Straight ahead.

287
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:29,755
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

288
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:34,343
- I don't see anything over there.
- Let me see.

289
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:38,514
Oh, she just pulled down the shade.

290
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:43,018
- You've got to be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.

291
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:48,107
Hold it, Serpico. What were you two doing?

292
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,862
In the shithouse in the dark.
Were you going down on him?

293
00:29:57,866 --> 00:30:01,078
- What are you talking about?
- You weren't doing a little peeping Tom.

294
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:04,998
- You were sucking his cock, weren't you?
- What are you, crazy?

295
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:06,625
I'll show you fucking crazy.

296
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,087
Last week I found a pair of shorts
with semen on them.

297
00:30:11,755 --> 00:30:13,507
There.

298
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:18,095
You're actually accusing me of this?

299
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:24,309
Good morning, Captain McClain.
I'm Officer Serpico.

300
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:26,603
I was told I could talk to you, sir.

301
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,650
Oh. Certainly, son. Come in.

302
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:38,240
Lieutenant Steiger won't make a report.

303
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:42,035
He's too concerned with the image
of his department.

304
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,581
But it... it could affect your future
at the BCI.

305
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:53,881
Sir, I tell you... er... frankly,
I don't see any future there.

306
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,135
It's all bullshit about it being a career path
toward being detective

307
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,389
- because I've been there two years now...
- And you want a transfer.

308
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:06,185
Yes, sir.
But I don't want to go back to Uniform.

309
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,854
I'll see what I can do, Frank.

310
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,735
Francis, do you know about
my weekend retreats for Catholic officers?

311
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:18,530
No.

312
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:21,909
You read that.
It might be of interest to you.

313
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,619
You are a Catholic, aren't you, Frank?

314
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,998
- Yeah. I was baptised.
- Good. Good.

315
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,294
Alfie, come on.

316
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,547
Paco! Ooh, missed you, baby!

317
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:42,846
- She's so crazy, that girl.
- Why "Paco"?

318
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:46,516
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favour?

319
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:49,019
- Get my keys out of this pocket for me.
- Sure.

320
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:53,398
Well, erm... what'll I call you?

321
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:55,776
Frank or... Pac0?

322
00:31:57,527 --> 00:31:59,196
Paco.

323
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:02,991
(Swinging jaZZ)

324
00:32:08,872 --> 00:32:10,582
- Leslie!
- Sally!

325
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,586
Oh, Larry! This is Paco.

326
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:18,840
Larry's a poet but he works
for an advertising agency.

327
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:22,177
And Sally's an actress
but she works for a photographer.

328
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:25,681
- Paco's a policeman.
- Oh... that's terrific.

329
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:29,059
- I work for the Police Department.
- That's really nice.

330
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,526
Pat's a novelist but you're working for
an insurance company now, aren't you?

331
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,486
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah.

332
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:42,739
- Paco's a policeman.
- Really? How exciting!

333
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:45,826
Not too. Right now I'm filing fingerprints.

334
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:49,079
Listen, I file insurance policies.

335
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:53,417
- We should get together and file...
- Hey, that was an improvement.

336
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,168
I want to ask you something.

337
00:32:55,294 --> 00:32:59,548
How come all your friends are
on their way to being somebody else?

338
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:01,133
Think about that.

339
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:05,095
I want to ask you something else, too.
Will you do me a big favour?

340
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,222
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

341
00:33:07,347 --> 00:33:11,560
- Let me just sort of do it myself.
- OK.

342
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:22,529
Hey, man, are you really a cop?

343
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:26,450
- That's right. I am.
- Wow.

344
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:30,787
- Leslie is a mind-fucker.
- You got to be kidding.

345
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:33,498
I didn't know that. What's a mind-fucker?

346
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:40,047
Well, it's a chick who digs intellectual types
and super bright guys.

347
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:44,801
- She's very perceptive.
- (Laughs)

348
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:55,854
Japanese culture and theatre and painting
is too rigidly stylised.

349
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:59,858
Well, you know. Yeah, but...

350
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:04,196
I think after a while
when you get through that

351
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:09,242
you start to appreciate
the clarity, the authority.

352
00:34:09,368 --> 00:34:11,787
- I got a sheepdog.
- Yes.

353
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:16,333
There have been sheepdogs in my family
dating back...

354
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,378
for sixteen generations.

355
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:23,340
Dating back to the Borgias.

356
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:30,180
The family crest is a sheepdog
pissing into a gondola.

357
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:42,859
Paco, everybody loves you! I love you!

358
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:59,376
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.

359
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:02,754
That fucking thing on your lip? It goes.
And get a haircut.

360
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:05,173
- Er... sir?
- That's an order.

361
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:06,967
You look like an asshole with dentures.

362
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:11,847
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure.

363
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:16,184
Go see Captain Tolkin. You got one foot
in shit already. Put the other one in.

364
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:18,520
Where might that be I wonder, sir?

365
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:22,065
Thank you, sir.

366
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:25,902
That is one hell of a moustache.
I wish I had the guts.

367
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:31,533
Well, I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

368
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:33,994
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I'd like to tell you, sir.

369
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:36,329
I thought so.

370
00:35:37,622 --> 00:35:41,960
I think it's time that we started
to communicate more on the streets.

371
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,796
The way it is, we're totally isolated, sir.

372
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:47,841
I mean, we're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

373
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:50,802
An undercover cop walks around in disguise

374
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,679
wearing black shoes and white socks.

375
00:35:53,513 --> 00:35:55,515
Everybody knows who he is.

376
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,395
You've made your point.
I want you to keep your moustache.

377
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:05,817
And I'd like you to patrol in your own car,
wear whatever you want.

378
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:08,904
- How does that strike you?
- I'd like that, sir.

379
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:11,948
- All right.
- To be honest, I'm bucking for detective.

380
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:15,160
- No shit.
- No.

381
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,005
(Alarm)

382
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:07,796
Hold it!

383
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:12,259
What the hell are you doing?

384
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:16,346
Oh, Christ.

385
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:19,724
Get against the wall.

386
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:23,311
Hey! I'm a police officer!

387
00:37:23,436 --> 00:37:26,773
Get over there. Hey! It's me, Serpico!

388
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,695
Hey, I'm a police officer! Police officer!

389
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,949
- I'm a police officer!
- Jesus, Frank!

390
00:37:36,074 --> 00:37:38,326
How was I supposed to recognise you?

391
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:42,455
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!

392
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:46,084
You didn't know me? You fire without looking?

393
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:49,629
You fire without a warning,
without a fucking brain in your head?

394
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:52,382
Oh, shit.

395
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,679
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

396
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,857
Holy shit, look at that mess.

397
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:16,114
- Filling out forms till next month.
- Good.

398
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:21,578
Jesus, Frank, I know this is
a hell of a time to ask you...

399
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:24,372
but I'll have to go through
all that ballistics bullshit.

400
00:38:24,497 --> 00:38:28,209
- Good. You should.
- It'll look bad with nothing to show for it.

401
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:31,254
Frank, do me a favour.

402
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:32,881
Give us the collar?

403
00:38:38,386 --> 00:38:39,554
You motherfucker.

404
00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:46,936
You want the collar?
You don't want to fill out forms?

405
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:02,369
Here.

406
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:06,706
- You're a buddy.
- Oh, I'm a buddy.

407
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,085
Only you tell Tolkin I gave it to you.

408
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:14,798
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample,

409
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:17,717
so that when you become plain clothes men,

410
00:39:17,842 --> 00:39:21,638
you'll be able to identify the pungent aroma

411
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:25,433
and recognise the disorienting effect
of the drug

412
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:29,145
when you observe them in narcotics suspects.

413
00:39:30,188 --> 00:39:32,440
Among users of the drug,

414
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:38,071
a marijuana cigarette
is referred to as reefer,

415
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:41,700
stick, roach, joint.

416
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:46,746
The drug itself is referred to as pot,

417
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:51,835
tea, boo, stuff, grass.

418
00:39:53,753 --> 00:39:56,047
Hey, this is real good shit.

419
00:39:56,715 --> 00:39:59,384
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.

420
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:04,514
Look what it is. It's a potato factory,
is what it is and I have to have some.

421
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,599
I love you. I love it.

422
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:09,144
I'll have some of that. We have nothing to...

423
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:10,687
I have to have a dime?

424
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:13,398
It goes in the little slot there.

425
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:16,735
That doesn't work.
It's from the civil war, this machine.

426
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,529
- Pull on it.
- It doesn't, doesn't, doesn't, doesn't.

427
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:22,991
- Go ahead.
- It should shoot out. Please! I beg of you!

428
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:25,618
Come out, potatoes! Come out!

429
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:31,374
- You're pretty fucking weird, for a cop.
- Me?!

430
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,919
- You! What about you?
- You're the weird guy.

431
00:40:35,044 --> 00:40:37,630
- You! You're a fucking hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.

432
00:40:37,756 --> 00:40:39,299
The two of us.

433
00:40:41,593 --> 00:40:43,178
Gimme.

434
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:47,432
Where are you supposed to go from here?

435
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:52,479
9-3 Precinct. Plain Clothes.
Put your gun away.

436
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:55,565
YOU?

437
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,358
I am scheduled to go

438
00:40:57,942 --> 00:41:00,945
on special assignment with
the Mayor's Department of Investigations,

439
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,655
Detective Squad.

440
00:41:05,116 --> 00:41:07,786
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.

441
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,205
No four years in Plain Clothes?

442
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:16,085
- Who do you know?
- I make it my business to know people.

443
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:19,047
- People who can help.
- Unfair.

444
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:24,052
- Unfair.
- Life is unfair, man.

445
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:30,350
You've got a feel for the streets
and I've got a feel for the politics, I guess.

446
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:34,437
You and me in one Bat Mobile
could clean up the city in no time.

447
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:37,816
I wonder if we can get candy
out of this machine.

448
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:45,365
No, thanks.

449
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:52,580
Well, this is a good place to tell you, Paco.

450
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:58,628
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

451
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:00,255
Yeah.

452
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:05,760
- What about him?
- I'm going to marry him in two months.

453
00:42:05,885 --> 00:42:08,054
Unless you marry me.

454
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:17,730
Mmm?

455
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:21,943
What about the theatre and the dancing?

456
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:24,070
A girl has to get married some time.

457
00:42:25,655 --> 00:42:28,575
Well, you're a long way
from some time, Leslie.

458
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:31,452
I thought you were committed.

459
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:35,039
- I am, but...
- Mm-hm.

460
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:39,168
You are but...?

461
00:42:41,963 --> 00:42:44,007
I can go on working and studying there.

462
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:46,634
Where? Fort Worth?

463
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:49,387
Amarillo.

464
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:52,724
Amarillo?

465
00:42:58,563 --> 00:43:00,148
Am I invited to the wedding?

466
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,237
I'll ask Roy.

467
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:14,370
It's pretty good in this precinct.
There you go.

468
00:43:15,246 --> 00:43:19,250
Usually a nine-to-five day is the best time
for policy and bookmaking.

469
00:43:20,126 --> 00:43:23,504
But if you have to work nights,
like liquor violations, just call in.

470
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,426
Don't worry about quotas right now.
A couple of hooker collars will keep it cool.

471
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:41,898
Serpico. Been holding this for you.

472
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:45,109
It's from Joyce Max.

473
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,583
(Serpico) First day on the Precinct
I get that.

474
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:47,588
This is great, Frank.

475
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:52,468
I can open a whole can of peas with this.

476
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:57,098
It's scary. I want to protect myself.

477
00:44:57,223 --> 00:45:00,059
OK. You know what we do with this?

478
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:02,812
- What?
- We take it to Inspector Kellogg.

479
00:45:03,938 --> 00:45:05,898
- Kellogg?
- Yeah.

480
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:11,446
Kellogg? Didn't he used to be
in Plain Clothes?

481
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:15,450
He's the second highest-ranking cop
in the Department of Investigations.

482
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:17,118
So what?

483
00:45:17,243 --> 00:45:20,788
So what? I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

484
00:45:20,913 --> 00:45:22,915
He owes me, you understand?

485
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:26,294
He's the most honest cop I know, Frank.

486
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:30,339
Frank... trust me.

487
00:45:42,685 --> 00:45:47,565
Things like this were common practice
in the bad old days.

488
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:50,234
Hard to believe it's still going on.

489
00:45:53,321 --> 00:45:56,949
Serpico, don't you think it's kinda stupid
taking an envelope

490
00:45:57,075 --> 00:45:59,368
from somebody you didn't know?

491
00:46:02,288 --> 00:46:04,165
Erm...

492
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:09,587
What was I supposed to do? How would
I know what was in it unless I took it?

493
00:46:09,712 --> 00:46:13,299
You, er... you have two alternatives.

494
00:46:13,424 --> 00:46:16,594
You can force me to take you
to the Commissioner of Investigations.

495
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,181
- He'll drag you in front of a grand jury.
- I don't want that.

496
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:24,393
Oh, I can understand that. Word will get out.

497
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:28,606
Before it's all over, they'll find you
face-down in the East River.

498
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,615
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.

499
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:42,036
Well, what do I do with this?

500
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:05,434
- Hey, sarge?
- Yeah?

501
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,812
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.

502
00:47:09,814 --> 00:47:12,692
A coloured cop gave me this.
I don't know what to do with it.

503
00:47:19,115 --> 00:47:21,993
Yeah. I'll send it on
to the Benevolent Association.

504
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:33,254
(Italian opera)

505
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,757
Alfie.

506
00:47:56,903 --> 00:47:58,362
Is that Bjorling?

507
00:48:05,912 --> 00:48:07,705
No. It's Di Stefano.

508
00:48:09,832 --> 00:48:11,792
I was sure it was Bjorling.

509
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:15,171
No.

510
00:48:19,842 --> 00:48:22,386
You can hear it better over here.

511
00:48:23,304 --> 00:48:25,389
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.

512
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,267
Coffee?

513
00:48:28,392 --> 00:48:30,937
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

514
00:48:32,772 --> 00:48:35,983
Why don't you call in sick? Perfect place.

515
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:38,986
(Laughs) Not me.

516
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:41,322
Are you dedicated or something?

517
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:46,077
That's right. I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.

518
00:48:46,202 --> 00:48:49,455
- What do they know?
- I like your garden.

519
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:57,046
Hey. Love my garden.

520
00:48:58,214 --> 00:49:01,050
OK. I love your garden.

521
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:07,348
- You know what they say, don't you?
- No. What do they say?

522
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:11,602
If you love a man's garden,
you've gotta love the man.

523
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:19,610
You like her, Alfie?

524
00:49:21,737 --> 00:49:24,031
All I can tell you is I gave it back.

525
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:26,450
I've got to get out of the 9-3.

526
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:29,829
What happened on your Narcotics application?

527
00:49:29,954 --> 00:49:33,916
It was all set until I told them
I was in Plain Clothes, and that was it.

528
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:38,170
It was like the kiss of death. They think
everybody in Clothes is on the take.

529
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:41,966
Sir, do you know anything
about the Bronx 7th Division?

530
00:49:42,091 --> 00:49:45,886
I can go there if I want,
but if it's the same shit, screw it.

531
00:49:46,012 --> 00:49:49,432
I'd rather answer phones for the Spanish
Communications Unit and go nuts.

532
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:51,225
Come on, Alfie.

533
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,813
Frank, did anyone ever tell you

534
00:49:55,938 --> 00:49:58,899
that you have a tendency towards self-pity?

535
00:50:00,985 --> 00:50:03,904
- No, you're the first.
- All right.

536
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:08,159
I have a friend up there. Roy Palmer.
He's an administrative officer.

537
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:11,495
- I'll speak with him.
- Good. Thank you, sir.

538
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,332
- Bye, Francis. God bless you.
- Thank you.

539
00:50:20,296 --> 00:50:21,672
(Phone rings)

540
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:26,677
- Yeah?
<i>- Frank? Captain McClain here.</i>

541
00:50:26,802 --> 00:50:29,680
- Captain McClain. Hold on a minute?
<i>- Sure.</i>

542
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:41,150
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Frank. I saw Inspector Palmer tonight.

543
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:44,945
He assures me the 7th Division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

544
00:50:45,071 --> 00:50:47,490
His words, Frank. "Clean as a hound's tooth."

545
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:51,285
<i>I told him that he was getting
a hard-working officer.</i>

546
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:55,373
Wears a beard, speaks Spanish.
He'd make a superb undercover man.

547
00:50:55,498 --> 00:50:58,959
- He was delighted.
- That's good news, sir.

548
00:50:59,085 --> 00:51:02,421
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
<i>- Good night, Frank. God bless.</i>

549
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:07,009
When did you start doing that?

550
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:14,642
McClain says that Palmer says that
the 7th is as clean as a hound's tooth.

551
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:18,854
Well, if that's true, your problems are over.

552
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:26,153
Plain Clothes Division?

553
00:51:27,655 --> 00:51:29,490
Upstairs.

554
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:44,171
Frank! How are you? Good to see you!
We heard you were coming up here.

555
00:51:44,296 --> 00:51:47,967
Hey, listen, say hello to Nate Smith.
Frank Serpico.

556
00:51:48,092 --> 00:51:50,886
- Jaime Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico.

557
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:54,390
You'll love it up here. It's beautiful.

558
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:58,018
I'll see you later. Take a ride with me.
I've got to make a collar.

559
00:51:58,144 --> 00:52:01,063
- Maybe I should check in.
- Fuck that. Come on.

560
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:06,235
<i>♪ Deck the hall with boughs of holly</i>

561
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,239
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la ♪

562
00:52:10,364 --> 00:52:13,492
...dollars if Minnesota. Right.

563
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:16,454
Green Bay twelve and a half at...

564
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:18,998
You dumb fuck.

565
00:52:19,123 --> 00:52:21,709
We told you this location's hot.
We told you to stay out of here.

566
00:52:21,834 --> 00:52:25,421
Keogh. Nobody told me. Honest.

567
00:52:25,546 --> 00:52:29,383
Bullshit. Let's take a walk.

568
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:34,430
- All right, a C-note a piece.
- No way. We got a complaint. Right?

569
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:37,975
- Come on.
- All right, make it two hundred, Keogh.

570
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,811
Are you getting cheap in your old age,
bambino?

571
00:52:40,936 --> 00:52:43,564
- Three.
- Three?

572
00:52:43,689 --> 00:52:47,359
- You heard me.
- All right. Three.

573
00:52:47,485 --> 00:52:49,778
I'll tell you what I'll do,
I'll make it a light one.

574
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:52,907
- Hey, Frankie.
- Yeah?

575
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:56,535
- Want to write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.

576
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,872
- Take the collar. Get on the sheet.
- I better check in.

577
00:52:59,997 --> 00:53:02,166
Hey, Frank.

578
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,043
We'll have a talk later, right?

579
00:53:08,797 --> 00:53:12,635
That dumb schmuck only came up
with two bills because I booked him.

580
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,390
- Here you go, Frank.
- No, it was your collar. Keep it.

581
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:22,061
I had a hunch you weren't going to take it.

582
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:28,400
Frankie, we got a call about you
from downtown. I ain't saying who.

583
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:31,654
They just said you couldn't be trusted,
you know?

584
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,866
- Cos I don't take money, right?
- Frank...

585
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:38,494
Let's face it. Who can trust a cop
who don't take money?

586
00:53:39,495 --> 00:53:41,914
You are pretty weird, you know, kid?

587
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:44,708
With that call and all,
the guys were getting a little worried.

588
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:47,586
I told them you were OK.
I knew you from the old 2-1.

589
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:50,673
You'd never hurt another cop. Right?

590
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:53,676
You'd never hurt another cop, would you?

591
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,055
- It'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frank.

592
00:53:59,557 --> 00:54:00,933
Frankie...

593
00:54:01,058 --> 00:54:02,851
(Kettle whistles)

594
00:54:03,769 --> 00:54:05,479
We're not doing anything bad here.

595
00:54:05,604 --> 00:54:11,402
We're skimming a little gambling money.
It's clean. It's not dope. Hurts nobody.

596
00:54:11,527 --> 00:54:16,782
Frank, a gambler's a gentleman.
They'll operate anyhow, right?

597
00:54:16,907 --> 00:54:20,869
Keogh, you don't have to explain
yourself to me. Do what you gotta do.

598
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:24,498
- Want some tea?
- I don't like that shit. I'll have a coffee.

599
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:28,335
What's the matter?
What are you worried about?

600
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:33,674
Listen, we don't go overboard here.
We're not sloppy. We're careful.

601
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:36,802
The spics, the niggers, we bust them
cos they operate so dumb

602
00:54:36,927 --> 00:54:39,346
they get your ass in hot water every time.

603
00:54:39,471 --> 00:54:42,099
But the Italians,
now, that's a different story.

604
00:54:42,224 --> 00:54:45,019
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.

605
00:54:45,144 --> 00:54:49,523
- You've got it analysed.
- You're fucking right I have. It's worth it.

606
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,111
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

607
00:54:56,113 --> 00:54:59,908
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.

608
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:04,622
That's 800 clams every time
your girlfriend gets the curse. Tax free.

609
00:55:05,497 --> 00:55:08,459
Here's the beauty. You don't get it
for the first eight weeks anyhow.

610
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:12,713
Till the guys get to know you
and you're OK. But you don't lose, either.

611
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:15,674
You get it on the other end
when you leave the Division.

612
00:55:16,842 --> 00:55:18,927
Frankie, it's like... it's like severance pay.

613
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:24,224
Think it over, all right? In or out.

614
00:55:27,686 --> 00:55:30,397
Look at me. I'm shaking.

615
00:55:33,859 --> 00:55:35,361
All my life I've wanted to be a cop.

616
00:55:36,403 --> 00:55:38,739
I can remember nothing else.

617
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:44,495
I remember this one time...

618
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:50,292
There was something happening.
A domestic argument or something.

619
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:52,294
Somebody stabbed somebody.

620
00:55:53,504 --> 00:55:59,385
And there was this crowd
around this tenement.

621
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:02,846
I must have been nine, ten years old.
I was this big.

622
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:08,060
I went over to see what was going on.
The red light was going round and round.

623
00:56:08,185 --> 00:56:11,563
There were all these people
and I couldn't see.

624
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:15,150
And I kept saying,
"Do you know what's going on?"

625
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:17,403
Nobody knew.

626
00:56:17,528 --> 00:56:21,949
It was like a big mystery
behind that... that crowd there.

627
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,202
All of a sudden...

628
00:56:25,994 --> 00:56:27,996
the crowd just parted.

629
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:30,541
Like the Red Sea, you see.

630
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:35,504
And there were these guys in blue
and I said, "They know."

631
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,175
But what do they know? What do they know?

632
00:56:45,389 --> 00:56:48,684
It's amazing. It's incredible.

633
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:52,771
But I feel like a criminal
cos I don't take money.

634
00:56:57,901 --> 00:57:01,113
- You get so tense when you talk about it.
- I wonder why.

635
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,240
Come here.

636
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:09,288
- Right there.
- Here?

637
00:57:09,413 --> 00:57:11,123
Uh-um.

638
00:57:11,248 --> 00:57:14,501
- I'm going to ask you a question, OK?
- OK.

639
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:17,504
- Do you like cops?
- You're my first.

640
00:57:20,507 --> 00:57:22,843
No, I mean all this shit
I've been telling you.

641
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:25,220
- Do you believe it?
- Why not?

642
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:29,475
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.

643
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,186
Aww. What's the matter with me?

644
00:57:33,312 --> 00:57:35,439
Everybody knows about cops.

645
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:39,109
Did you ever hear the story of the wise king?

646
00:57:39,234 --> 00:57:41,779
No. But I got the feeling I'm gonna hear it.

647
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:47,493
Well, there was this king
and he ruled over his kingdom.

648
00:57:47,618 --> 00:57:51,288
Right in the middle of the kingdom,
there was a well.

649
00:57:51,413 --> 00:57:53,081
That's where everybody drank.

650
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:58,545
One night, this witch came along
and she poisoned the well.

651
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:03,383
And the next day everybody drank from it
except the king.

652
00:58:03,509 --> 00:58:06,887
They all went crazy.
They got together in the street

653
00:58:07,012 --> 00:58:11,058
and said, "We've got to get rid
of the king, cos the king is mad."

654
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:16,605
And then that night he went down
and he drank from the well.

655
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,483
And the next day all the people rejoiced

656
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:22,820
because their king had regained his reason.

657
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:30,536
- I think you're trying to tell me something.
- Me?

658
00:58:33,622 --> 00:58:35,666
Hey, Frank, I want you to say hello
to somebody.

659
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:39,503
- Drop your cocks and grab your socks.
- What the fuck is this?

660
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:44,007
Frank Serpico, say hello to Don Rubello.

661
00:58:44,132 --> 00:58:46,468
He's gonna be your new partner.

662
00:58:47,845 --> 00:58:51,598
Hey look, if you don't want to work
with this fucking nut for some reason,

663
00:58:51,723 --> 00:58:54,017
I'll buddy up with him, all right?

664
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:59,523
And go through all that crap changing
assignments? Nah, we'll be OK.

665
00:58:59,648 --> 00:59:01,358
<i>We're Paisans, right?</i>

666
00:59:04,152 --> 00:59:06,446
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- He's my partner.

667
00:59:07,072 --> 00:59:10,951
He's specially trained.
He goes to track down heroin.

668
00:59:12,494 --> 00:59:15,205
Let him loose, he goes into the hole,
picks it up, brings it back.

669
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,708
Sniffs it out, brings it to you.

670
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:20,377
Yeah, I've heard of that.

671
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:23,338
You heard of that? Yeah.

672
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:28,218
This guy I'm looking for. Vernon.

673
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:33,515
He's a numbers collector
who ain't been meeting his obligations.

674
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,477
He won't be hard to spot. He's a mover.
This is prime time.

675
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:43,150
Since we're partners,
you've gotta know the situation.

676
00:59:44,526 --> 00:59:47,905
Straight off. I collect for the Division.

677
00:59:48,614 --> 00:59:50,699
Me and two other bagmen.

678
00:59:50,824 --> 00:59:53,201
That's what Keogh was sort of hinting at.

679
00:59:55,454 --> 00:59:58,415
Yeah, three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

680
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,752
Hey, look. There he is.

681
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:16,683
Son of a bitch!

682
01:00:21,188 --> 01:00:23,899
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!

683
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:37,287
(Car horn honks)

684
01:01:38,432 --> 01:01:40,434
Where's the money?

685
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:49,943
You've been jerking me around, you fuck.

686
01:01:50,068 --> 01:01:52,320
I know I'm behind now, man!

687
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:58,368
Three times you never showed, right?

688
01:01:58,493 --> 01:02:03,999
I'll have it for you tonight. I swear.
I'll have it for you tonight. Don't bust me!

689
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:09,212
Last time, Vernon. The last time!

690
01:02:09,337 --> 01:02:12,340
You fuck me and you're gone.
You hear? You hear?

691
01:02:14,718 --> 01:02:18,930
See you at the Domino. Midnight. You'd
better have $300, you fuck. You hear?

692
01:02:19,056 --> 01:02:21,058
Right? Right?

693
01:02:23,977 --> 01:02:25,687
All right, Frank.

694
01:02:29,608 --> 01:02:33,445
Huh? Huh? I keep this place for socialising.

695
01:02:34,654 --> 01:02:38,408
Some day we'll get a couple of broads,
huh? Have a little party.

696
01:02:40,702 --> 01:02:42,245
Hey!

697
01:02:44,206 --> 01:02:46,750
Mix some ice. Booze is right over here.

698
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:53,799
So what do you think, Frank? About the money?

699
01:02:54,508 --> 01:03:00,180
Look, Don... If I was broke,
I had a family, I don't know.

700
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:03,308
But I'm not broke and I don't have a family.

701
01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:05,685
Why the fuck stick my neck out,
you know what I mean?

702
01:03:05,811 --> 01:03:08,021
It's already out, Frank,
for not taking the money.

703
01:03:08,897 --> 01:03:10,899
It's better the other guys don't know that.

704
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:13,068
Hey. Tell you what I'll do.

705
01:03:14,402 --> 01:03:19,032
I'll hold your share for you. If you change
your mind, it'll be right in here.

706
01:03:19,157 --> 01:03:23,870
Right in here, right down to the penny.
Hey. Look at that.

707
01:03:24,329 --> 01:03:27,332
- What are you drinking?
- Scotch.

708
01:03:30,252 --> 01:03:33,421
Next thing I want to do
is get a colour TV for the games.

709
01:03:33,547 --> 01:03:36,216
How about some gin? Penny a point. Huh?

710
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,236
Yeah, let me ask him first.

711
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:06,746
Hello, Frank. Get in.

712
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:16,631
My God, Frank. This is confidential.

713
01:04:18,466 --> 01:04:21,011
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.

714
01:04:21,136 --> 01:04:23,096
No. Absolutely not.

715
01:04:23,471 --> 01:04:25,307
All right. All right.

716
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,896
Frank, I notified Commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

717
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:33,481
He wants you to stay right where you are

718
01:04:33,607 --> 01:04:35,483
and continue to collect information.

719
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:38,195
Then you'll be his eyes and his ears.

720
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:44,326
He said he was delighted that, quote,
"a man of integrity had surfaced." Unquote.

721
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:47,996
When do I hear from him?

722
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:51,249
He said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

723
01:04:53,543 --> 01:04:55,629
- Reach out?
- Mm-hm.

724
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,259
My situation's pretty fucking sticky
up there. What am I supposed to do?

725
01:05:01,384 --> 01:05:03,386
- Just wait for him?
- You must have patience, Frank.

726
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:06,306
- Yeah, but it's fucking sticky.
- Patience and faith.

727
01:05:06,431 --> 01:05:09,517
When a man like the Commissioner
says he'll get in touch with you,

728
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:10,852
he'll get in touch with you.

729
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:15,398
Goodbye, son. God bless you.

730
01:05:30,288 --> 01:05:35,669
All right, now. Marinda's too hot.
We've got to lay off him for a few months.

731
01:05:35,794 --> 01:05:39,839
And Falco's got two runners he ain't
paying for. Check that fucking guy out.

732
01:05:39,965 --> 01:05:44,177
Hey, Frank. How are you?
Listen, Rubello's being transferred.

733
01:05:44,302 --> 01:05:48,390
- You'll have to work with a new bagman.
- AI Sarno, meet Frank Serpico.

734
01:05:48,515 --> 01:05:51,434
- This'll be your new man.
- All right?

735
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:57,023
You know that operation down by
Hunt's Point? What will we do about that?

736
01:05:57,148 --> 01:06:01,987
You the new bagman? You prick! What
happened to Rubello, you son of a bitch?

737
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:05,824
Wait a minute.

738
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:22,882
You know, Frank, sometimes I ask myself,
"What the fuck am I doing?"

739
01:06:24,968 --> 01:06:29,264
If this ever came out... Christ, my family.

740
01:06:31,891 --> 01:06:36,479
My daughter. She just started
with the San Francisco Opera.

741
01:06:36,896 --> 01:06:39,607
Chorus. Took a lot of money.

742
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:46,614
I once tried to pull out.
Christ, they were all over me.

743
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:50,618
So you just go along.

744
01:06:55,206 --> 01:06:57,876
Unless you're willing to go back
to uniform duty.

745
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:20,732
Shit, how the money rolls in.
Here, let me give you yours now.

746
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:22,901
No. I'm not on.

747
01:07:23,651 --> 01:07:25,278
What do you mean you're not on?

748
01:07:25,403 --> 01:07:28,114
Just what I said. I'm not on.
I don't take money.

749
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,451
- Some gag here?
- No, I told you straight.

750
01:07:32,243 --> 01:07:35,038
I don't take money. That's the truth.

751
01:07:36,956 --> 01:07:38,625
What were you doing with Rubello?

752
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:41,044
Ask Rubello.

753
01:07:43,546 --> 01:07:46,341
You're not... Where's it been going?

754
01:07:46,466 --> 01:07:48,259
Ask Rubello.

755
01:07:49,803 --> 01:07:54,391
<i>- All right, sir. I'll go to Delaney myself.</i>
- That would not be advisable, Frank.

756
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:57,894
You don't understand, Captain.
It's been weeks. Not a word.

757
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:02,482
<i>- I understand perfectly, Frank.</i>
- No, but Captain, they know I'm not on.

758
01:08:02,607 --> 01:08:05,276
I've done all I can do. Goodbye, Frank.

759
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:13,576
He's out. Won't do another fucking thing.

760
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:17,789
No, I'm telling you, nothing's gonna
happen from the inside.

761
01:08:17,914 --> 01:08:20,625
The top guys have been cops too long.

762
01:08:22,127 --> 01:08:24,129
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?

763
01:08:24,254 --> 01:08:26,131
Not a fucking word.

764
01:08:33,012 --> 01:08:36,474
- Would you go outside the Department?
- Where could we go?

765
01:08:38,518 --> 01:08:41,521
Would you believe the Mayor's office?

766
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:51,656
- The Mayor's office?
- His right-hand man.

767
01:08:51,781 --> 01:08:54,242
A guy named Jerry Berman, from Princeton.

768
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:56,911
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

769
01:08:57,036 --> 01:08:59,414
And he cares, Frank. He really cares.

770
01:09:03,793 --> 01:09:07,380
Do you know what we're doing?
We're going outside the Department.

771
01:09:07,505 --> 01:09:09,340
That's right.

772
01:09:13,553 --> 01:09:19,100
<i>Dynamite</i>. Every plain clothes man
in the Division and one or two lieutenants?

773
01:09:19,225 --> 01:09:22,645
That is... that is dynamite.
That is incredible.

774
01:09:24,063 --> 01:09:29,652
That is 150... that is $250,000 a year.

775
01:09:29,777 --> 01:09:31,738
But that is just one precinct!

776
01:09:33,573 --> 01:09:35,575
That is amazing!

777
01:09:37,035 --> 01:09:40,622
What I feel is needed here
is a real investigation.

778
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:44,125
And I am sure that the Mayor
will see this immediately.

779
01:09:44,667 --> 01:09:48,546
McClain and Delaney. They have done nothing.

780
01:09:49,339 --> 01:09:51,341
Man, that is amazing.

781
01:09:54,552 --> 01:09:57,764
And another thing, see...
In a couple of days,

782
01:09:57,889 --> 01:10:00,767
they're going to have a meeting at a pad...

783
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:04,270
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that. Rumours.

784
01:10:04,395 --> 01:10:07,732
I have heard rumours,
but never touching it directly.

785
01:10:07,857 --> 01:10:13,530
(Whispers) For an on-the-line cop
to come forward like this is beautiful.

786
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:17,450
Really, Frank, you have my respect.

787
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:21,621
And my sympathy for what
you've been going through, man. Wow.

788
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:29,754
Hello, this is Jerry Berman. Is he there?

789
01:10:31,214 --> 01:10:32,549
All right. I'll hold on.

790
01:10:49,357 --> 01:10:50,650
Well?

791
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:55,947
- Tell me what happened, Paco.
- I'd like a drink.

792
01:11:02,036 --> 01:11:04,205
That guy's gonna go to the Mayor.

793
01:11:09,168 --> 01:11:11,462
- To the Mayor!
- (Laughs)

794
01:11:14,132 --> 01:11:17,510
Come here, Alfie.
We're all gonna go to the Mayor together!

795
01:11:22,098 --> 01:11:24,517
I couldn't be any more embarrassed.

796
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:28,396
It's like a personal defeat.

797
01:11:29,897 --> 01:11:31,649
However...

798
01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:35,778
- there are priorities.
- What are the priorities, Jerry?

799
01:11:36,613 --> 01:11:41,117
The priorities are a long, hot summer ahead

800
01:11:41,242 --> 01:11:43,953
and riots are expected.

801
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:49,083
And the Mayor cannot alienate
the police force.

802
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:53,171
Now in the fall... now in the fall...

803
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:56,591
it may be possible to take
another look at the situation.

804
01:11:56,716 --> 01:11:58,551
All right. I'm sorry.

805
01:12:00,053 --> 01:12:01,387
Frank!

806
01:12:13,232 --> 01:12:18,821
The whole of the rotten... chicken shit...
fucking system's corrupt.

807
01:12:22,283 --> 01:12:24,160
- (Knocking)
- Who's there?

808
01:12:24,285 --> 01:12:26,120
(Blair) It's me, Frank.
I've got to talk to you.

809
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:32,418
Frank, you're behaving
like a goddamn child. You hear?

810
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:35,546
Let him in.

811
01:12:37,298 --> 01:12:38,925
You let him in.

812
01:12:48,267 --> 01:12:50,269
- Hi.
- Hello.

813
01:12:57,985 --> 01:13:00,697
Sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

814
01:13:00,822 --> 01:13:03,533
Bullshit. I got me into this whole thing.

815
01:13:05,076 --> 01:13:09,997
"Wow. Amazing. Dynamite. Beautiful."

816
01:13:10,123 --> 01:13:15,002
"Dynamite. Priorities. Priorities."
You and your big-deal friends.

817
01:13:15,586 --> 01:13:18,756
Your contacts. Your big bullshit names.

818
01:13:18,881 --> 01:13:21,759
Bob Blair, the big operator from Princeton.

819
01:13:21,884 --> 01:13:24,846
The mystery man with connections.
The hotline to the Mayor.

820
01:13:24,971 --> 01:13:27,056
Who the fuck do you think you are?
You son of a bitch.

821
01:13:27,181 --> 01:13:31,978
You come looking for help, whining with
your humble pie act, the injured innocent.

822
01:13:32,103 --> 01:13:36,774
Who told you the Department or the world
was a fucking Boy Scout camp?

823
01:13:38,317 --> 01:13:41,154
What did you expect, for Christ's sake,
a magician?

824
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:42,947
Big Daddy?

825
01:13:43,072 --> 01:13:46,617
- A white knight who rides in on a horse...
- You just keep talking.

826
01:13:46,743 --> 01:13:50,455
- Keep talking cos that's what you do.
- ...the Pope's choir sings Ave Maria?

827
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,039
I tried to help you!

828
01:13:52,165 --> 01:13:54,459
You're gonna blame me cos
those bastards won't get involved?

829
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:57,253
I tried to help you,
got my head handed to me.

830
01:13:57,378 --> 01:14:00,006
Where's your head?
It's on your shoulders. That's what I see.

831
01:14:00,131 --> 01:14:03,217
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit over here?

832
01:14:03,342 --> 01:14:05,678
Get ready to blow up again
cos I've got another idea.

833
01:14:05,803 --> 01:14:08,431
Your ideas are as full of shit as you are.

834
01:14:08,681 --> 01:14:12,685
We can talk to Foreman, Frank,
the Commissioner of Investigations.

835
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:15,354
We've got another guy here.

836
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,857
<i>We could even talk to a guy I know
on the New York Times.</i>

837
01:14:18,983 --> 01:14:21,861
<i>That's terrific. Go to the Times.</i>

838
01:14:22,737 --> 01:14:25,948
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.

839
01:14:26,073 --> 01:14:29,494
- It's safe, Frank.
- With my ass on the line, it's safe?

840
01:14:29,619 --> 01:14:33,164
- Your ass is already on the line.
- That's my business, all right?

841
01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:35,166
- You don't trust me, Frank?
- I don't trust you.

842
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:37,001
- Go fuck yourself.
- Fuck you.

843
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:43,716
Look, when I come home,
I want the house clean.

844
01:14:43,841 --> 01:14:45,259
Don't take it out on me, Paco.

845
01:14:45,384 --> 01:14:47,386
I'm not! I don't want to pick up shit!

846
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,886
Honey?

847
01:15:30,763 --> 01:15:32,431
Come to bed.

848
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:37,288
- Hello, Frank.
- Hey, Frank.

849
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:43,127
All right, we all know what this is about,
right?

850
01:16:43,252 --> 01:16:47,340
So without any bullshit, what was
happening between you and Don Rubello?

851
01:16:50,009 --> 01:16:53,971
It's simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.

852
01:16:54,096 --> 01:16:59,143
Rubello said if I changed my mind,
he'd hold my share.

853
01:16:59,268 --> 01:17:02,730
He'd give it back to me.
I didn't change my mind.

854
01:17:02,855 --> 01:17:04,357
Conniving bastard.

855
01:17:04,482 --> 01:17:09,111
All right. Look, I'll handle Rubello.
I'll get back the money he took.

856
01:17:09,904 --> 01:17:13,783
But this ain't gonna happen again.
From now on, no more three bagmen.

857
01:17:13,908 --> 01:17:17,370
Starting today, everyone of you fucks
makes his own collections.

858
01:17:17,495 --> 01:17:20,539
- No stops, no bread. OK?
- OK.

859
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:22,416
- Right.
- You got it.

860
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:25,461
What about you, Frank?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

861
01:17:26,379 --> 01:17:27,964
Why should I start now?

862
01:17:28,965 --> 01:17:30,967
Everybody would feel
a lot better about you, Frank.

863
01:17:31,092 --> 01:17:33,302
You can always give it to charity, Frank.

864
01:17:34,845 --> 01:17:37,807
Look, Frank, what do you say,
$100 a month, just for expenses?

865
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:42,478
For my secretary and
my business lunches, entertainment?

866
01:17:45,773 --> 01:17:47,817
All right. All right.

867
01:17:47,942 --> 01:17:50,987
We split Frank's share from now on.
You're a schmuck, Frank.

868
01:18:00,871 --> 01:18:04,458
If they would take all that energy,
put it into straight police work,

869
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:08,170
we'd have the city cleaned up in a week.
There'd be no crime.

870
01:18:15,594 --> 01:18:18,264
If I could work alone. That's the thing, see.

871
01:18:18,764 --> 01:18:20,683
If I could just get to work alone.

872
01:18:20,808 --> 01:18:23,561
They don't like that.
They want to suck you in.

873
01:18:23,686 --> 01:18:26,647
You go over the same thing, Paco.

874
01:18:26,772 --> 01:18:30,735
It's so fucking corrupt. Everybody,
everyone. Nobody giving a shit.

875
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,071
There's gotta be a way to wipe it out,
goddamn it. There's gotta be a way.

876
01:18:34,196 --> 01:18:36,490
Let's get out of here. Let's go to a movie.

877
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:40,369
Will you quit handling me? Go to a movie?
How am I gonna go to a movie?

878
01:18:40,494 --> 01:18:43,956
Do you know they'd kill me if they knew?
You think that doesn't happen?

879
01:18:44,081 --> 01:18:47,543
Either you're exploding
or you're lying around like a catatonic.

880
01:18:47,668 --> 01:18:51,172
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

881
01:18:51,297 --> 01:18:54,550
All I care about is you.
That's all that matters to me.

882
01:18:54,675 --> 01:18:57,928
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this.

883
01:18:58,054 --> 01:19:01,891
Scared, miserable, dreading to go to work.

884
01:19:02,016 --> 01:19:03,559
It's tearing me apart.

885
01:19:03,684 --> 01:19:07,563
And then I get sick of hearing about it
and I start hating myself.

886
01:19:07,688 --> 01:19:11,442
You don't like the idea of me being a cop,
so don't give me that shit.

887
01:19:11,567 --> 01:19:16,947
I love you, Paco. I want to marry you.
I want to have children with you.

888
01:19:17,073 --> 01:19:20,826
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Then why don't you get out?

889
01:19:20,951 --> 01:19:24,205
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.

890
01:19:25,081 --> 01:19:26,373
Well, do it.

891
01:19:26,499 --> 01:19:27,666
(Sobbing)

892
01:19:40,763 --> 01:19:44,183
- What have you got?
- Would you bust a whitey?

893
01:19:44,308 --> 01:19:46,185
Try me. Try me.

894
01:19:47,269 --> 01:19:51,273
This guy's heavy. He's Italian. Mobbed up.

895
01:19:52,942 --> 01:19:54,110
Still interested?

896
01:19:54,235 --> 01:19:56,862
Stop fucking around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

897
01:19:56,987 --> 01:20:00,783
There's a loan shark.
Runs a big numbers operation.

898
01:20:01,784 --> 01:20:04,120
This mother's so cocksure,

899
01:20:04,245 --> 01:20:07,706
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

900
01:20:07,832 --> 01:20:09,208
Where's the drop?

901
01:20:56,338 --> 01:20:59,800
Hold it. I'm a police officer.

902
01:21:00,551 --> 01:21:02,052
And...

903
01:21:03,846 --> 01:21:05,681
Wait a minute.

904
01:21:05,806 --> 01:21:07,308
You're under arrest.

905
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:10,144
Hell, I thought you were some fucking junkie.

906
01:21:10,269 --> 01:21:12,938
I'll take that wad in your pocket.

907
01:21:13,772 --> 01:21:16,942
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know, I'm a joke. What're you doing?

908
01:21:17,067 --> 01:21:18,819
What's that?

909
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:21,363
Put that away. You're in more trouble.
Give me the keys to your car.

910
01:21:27,953 --> 01:21:31,332
- Where have they been hiding you, kid?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

911
01:21:34,793 --> 01:21:38,589
Hold this guy for booking. Get a rap
sheet on him. I'm gonna search his car.

912
01:22:02,488 --> 01:22:05,783
- Where's Corsaro?
- Smith took him upstairs.

913
01:22:16,252 --> 01:22:18,462
I swear, I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie!

914
01:22:18,587 --> 01:22:20,256
(All laugh)

915
01:22:25,302 --> 01:22:27,137
(Serpico whistles)

916
01:22:34,228 --> 01:22:36,689
_ Hey! YOU. _ Hey:

917
01:22:37,356 --> 01:22:40,901
You. Get over here and empty your pockets.

918
01:22:41,026 --> 01:22:43,696
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. You do what I say.

919
01:22:43,821 --> 01:22:45,948
- Get over here.
- He's gonna get nasty about it.

920
01:22:46,907 --> 01:22:48,909
You're fucking right!

921
01:22:49,576 --> 01:22:51,287
Frank, cool it, man!

922
01:22:52,371 --> 01:22:54,957
Lean, motherfucker! Spread!

923
01:22:55,082 --> 01:22:57,501
Frank, Rudy's on. He's good people.

924
01:22:57,626 --> 01:22:59,211
Stay the fuck out of this!

925
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,677
What's this? What's this?

926
01:23:06,802 --> 01:23:08,637
Get in there.

927
01:23:57,603 --> 01:24:01,315
Serpico. Got that record check on Corsaro.

928
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:18,123
Want to read something?

929
01:24:20,334 --> 01:24:22,544
It's about your pal, Corsaro.

930
01:24:22,669 --> 01:24:25,130
Here, read it. Read it.

931
01:24:28,467 --> 01:24:30,177
He did 15 years. You know what for?

932
01:24:31,178 --> 01:24:34,098
For killing a cop. He's a fucking cop-killer.

933
01:24:45,734 --> 01:24:47,986
- It's good to see you again.
- That's it. I've had it. I'm finished.

934
01:24:48,112 --> 01:24:50,823
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it any more. I've got to get out.

935
01:24:50,948 --> 01:24:53,492
If I have to go back to Uniform, I will.

936
01:24:53,617 --> 01:24:57,246
I can't wait for Delaney to call
and I can't play their game any more.

937
01:24:57,371 --> 01:24:59,373
The Commissioner didn't get in touch?

938
01:24:59,498 --> 01:25:02,709
Not a word. No investigation.
No undercover work.

939
01:25:02,835 --> 01:25:04,378
I had no idea, Frank.

940
01:25:04,503 --> 01:25:07,047
Well, Captain,
I think it's only fair to tell you

941
01:25:07,172 --> 01:25:08,632
I've been to outside agencies.

942
01:25:08,757 --> 01:25:11,468
- I'll go to more if I have to.
- What outside agencies?

943
01:25:12,428 --> 01:25:15,764
Holy mother of God. Frank,
we wash our own laundry around here.

944
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:18,058
You could be brought up on charges.

945
01:25:18,183 --> 01:25:21,979
The reality is we do not wash
our own laundry. It just gets dirtier.

946
01:25:22,104 --> 01:25:25,899
- You are in trouble.
- I don't care who gets it, including myself.

947
01:25:26,024 --> 01:25:29,278
- If I have to go to outside agencies...
- Stay away from outside agencies!

948
01:25:29,403 --> 01:25:31,280
Where am I gonna go?

949
01:25:31,405 --> 01:25:33,991
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait till you hear from me!

950
01:25:34,116 --> 01:25:36,160
- I've been waiting for a year and a half.
- I'll get back to you.

951
01:25:36,285 --> 01:25:39,121
That's not enough. Where am I gonna go?

952
01:25:41,915 --> 01:25:44,084
It's my life, you fuck!

953
01:25:46,003 --> 01:25:49,423
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.

954
01:25:57,723 --> 01:26:02,186
For this precinct, cases reported -
murder, 14 for August,

955
01:26:02,311 --> 01:26:06,023
20 for September... Serpico!

956
01:26:07,774 --> 01:26:09,651
Inspector Palmer?

957
01:26:12,029 --> 01:26:16,450
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley and
Inspector Gilbert are waiting to see you.

958
01:26:20,412 --> 01:26:22,414
Want to come to my office?

959
01:26:28,378 --> 01:26:30,088
Captain McClain called me.

960
01:26:31,298 --> 01:26:35,302
I've briefed Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert on your allegations.

961
01:26:36,011 --> 01:26:38,972
The obvious question is this -
in all these months,

962
01:26:39,097 --> 01:26:40,766
why didn't you come to us?

963
01:26:43,143 --> 01:26:45,979
Well, er...

964
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:50,734
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir, and...

965
01:26:50,859 --> 01:26:54,446
<i>er... you told... you... you...</i>

966
01:26:54,571 --> 01:26:58,617
you told Captain McClain that the Division
was clean as a hound's tooth.

967
01:26:58,742 --> 01:27:04,414
You think you're the only honest cop
on the force, Serpico? My record's clear.

968
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,041
Inspector Gilbert's just come from

969
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:09,586
the Commissioner's Confidential
Investigation Unit.

970
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:12,047
Then you must have heard something.

971
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:16,301
I don't understand.

972
01:27:16,426 --> 01:27:19,263
Commissioner Delaney has known
about this from the beginning.

973
01:27:21,557 --> 01:27:23,809
I didn't hear a thing.

974
01:27:23,934 --> 01:27:29,356
But I understand your frustration,
Frank, believe me.

975
01:27:29,481 --> 01:27:33,777
It's sort of like trying to punch
your way out of a paper bag, right?

976
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:40,617
What outside agencies
have you been to, Frank?

977
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:51,044
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

978
01:27:52,379 --> 01:27:56,174
We ought to ask Serpico directly
if he's going to cooperate or not.

979
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:00,512
We've got to know if there's
any real basis for an investigation.

980
01:28:04,099 --> 01:28:08,895
Well, l... l don't have to think that...
I have to think about that.

981
01:28:10,022 --> 01:28:12,274
What is there to think about?

982
01:28:13,275 --> 01:28:16,111
I don't see how the Division
can investigate itself.

983
01:28:17,946 --> 01:28:19,531
You've got a point there.

984
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:23,910
But you would cooperate
with an impartial investigation, right?

985
01:28:27,581 --> 01:28:29,833
Yeah. Up to a point.

986
01:28:30,959 --> 01:28:32,753
As long as I'm not involved.

987
01:28:34,004 --> 01:28:37,674
I just want to go someplace
where I can do my job.

988
01:28:37,799 --> 01:28:39,676
That's fair enough.

989
01:28:40,469 --> 01:28:41,845
We'll be in touch.

990
01:28:46,642 --> 01:28:49,519
Inspector Palmer? May I see you?

991
01:28:56,109 --> 01:28:58,487
Was it necessary to let everyone
in the station house know

992
01:28:58,612 --> 01:29:01,114
I was coming to see these guys?

993
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:04,242
You believe from what you now know
that an investigation is warranted?

994
01:29:05,827 --> 01:29:08,747
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.

995
01:29:12,793 --> 01:29:17,756
But sir, shouldn't Headquarters
handle something like this?

996
01:29:18,507 --> 01:29:22,010
No. You're all experienced men.

997
01:29:24,596 --> 01:29:27,099
Chief Gallagher here will be available
for consultation.

998
01:29:33,021 --> 01:29:34,481
Commissioner...

999
01:29:37,025 --> 01:29:39,528
Serpico claims that, er...

1000
01:29:40,821 --> 01:29:44,116
Inspector McClain talked to you
about this whole thing some time ago.

1001
01:29:44,241 --> 01:29:47,953
Yes. I seem to remember something about that.

1002
01:29:52,791 --> 01:29:56,837
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park".

1003
01:29:56,962 --> 01:29:58,547
We need a location.

1004
01:29:59,297 --> 01:30:03,176
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off. What do you want?

1005
01:30:03,301 --> 01:30:05,846
The whole thing signed, sealed, delivered?

1006
01:30:05,971 --> 01:30:08,098
You're conducting this investigation, not me.

1007
01:30:08,223 --> 01:30:11,101
All right, Frank. Lieutenant Smith.
Let's get back to him.

1008
01:30:11,226 --> 01:30:14,396
Lieutenant Smith. Lieutenant Smith said to me

1009
01:30:15,522 --> 01:30:19,484
if I didn't want the money,
he would stash it in his attic.

1010
01:30:20,068 --> 01:30:21,611
I'll have him transferred in the morning.

1011
01:30:21,737 --> 01:30:24,489
Fuck him. How about transferring me?

1012
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:34,833
Serpico.

1013
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:41,631
I hear you've been vouchering pad money
over to a confidential investigation squad.

1014
01:30:42,632 --> 01:30:44,217
Oh, yeah?

1015
01:30:44,342 --> 01:30:46,261
How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

1016
01:30:47,471 --> 01:30:49,514
You won't find anything on Serpico.

1017
01:30:52,225 --> 01:30:54,978
He's clean. Right?

1018
01:30:58,482 --> 01:31:00,901
- Hm?
- You practising your frisk?

1019
01:31:02,402 --> 01:31:06,573
No. I'm looking to buy a used tape recorder.

1020
01:31:09,701 --> 01:31:13,789
Wear a wire? They're feeling me up
every day. How can I wear a wire?

1021
01:31:13,914 --> 01:31:15,957
Come on, Frank.

1022
01:31:16,082 --> 01:31:19,836
Look, wearing a wire means testifying
to corroborate the tape, right?

1023
01:31:19,961 --> 01:31:22,297
Right. I'm not testifying.

1024
01:31:23,715 --> 01:31:25,759
I've got to put a dime in the parking meter.

1025
01:31:25,884 --> 01:31:29,805
Franklin, put a dime
in the parking meter for Serpico.

1026
01:31:34,559 --> 01:31:39,272
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, District Attorney.

1027
01:31:39,397 --> 01:31:40,982
Yeah, I watch television.

1028
01:31:41,441 --> 01:31:45,320
Frank, I want to compliment you
for coming forward like this.

1029
01:31:45,445 --> 01:31:48,824
It's unique. It's uniquely unique.

1030
01:31:48,949 --> 01:31:51,535
You should be proud of yourself.

1031
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:54,454
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shit heels,

1032
01:31:54,579 --> 01:31:57,707
with Frank Serpico as my star witness.

1033
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:02,504
Mr Tauber, you and everybody in this
room can go to hell, cos I'm not testifying.

1034
01:32:02,629 --> 01:32:05,882
Wait, wait, wait. Just a second, Frank.

1035
01:32:06,007 --> 01:32:08,635
You have nothing to fear.
You're not gonna be singled out.

1036
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,137
You don't understand. I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows...

1037
01:32:11,263 --> 01:32:12,681
- Wait a minute.
- ...if it meant something.

1038
01:32:12,806 --> 01:32:15,350
- But this investigation is bullshit.
- Do you mind if I say something?

1039
01:32:15,475 --> 01:32:19,437
You're not going after corruption
in the Department, the Division, the Bronx.

1040
01:32:19,563 --> 01:32:23,692
A few flunkey cops thrown to the wolves
to protect Delaney and those guys.

1041
01:32:23,817 --> 01:32:26,361
They've known about this shit for years
and won't do a fucking thing about it.

1042
01:32:26,486 --> 01:32:27,863
That's why I won't testify.

1043
01:33:02,188 --> 01:33:03,857
OK, what's this?

1044
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:06,735
Exactly what it says.

1045
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,695
I'm splitting.

1046
01:33:09,154 --> 01:33:11,197
I've never read anything so stupid -

1047
01:33:11,323 --> 01:33:13,992
"I'm leaving. If you want to discuss it,
I'll be at Felix's."

1048
01:33:14,117 --> 01:33:16,369
I didn't feel like
another blood and gut scene.

1049
01:33:16,494 --> 01:33:20,707
- I figured you wouldn't be able to shout.
- I can shout anywhere!

1050
01:33:25,337 --> 01:33:27,339
I won't shout.

1051
01:33:28,882 --> 01:33:30,592
Sit down. Sit down.

1052
01:33:43,897 --> 01:33:47,901
It's just going to go on and on, Paco.
It isn't going to get any better.

1053
01:33:49,694 --> 01:33:52,781
And if you quit, somehow I'll be blamed.

1054
01:34:01,748 --> 01:34:05,669
How could you leave the man you love?
The future father of your kids?

1055
01:34:09,756 --> 01:34:12,300
You never said anything
like that to me before.

1056
01:34:14,135 --> 01:34:15,845
And if I come back...

1057
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,014
you won't say it again.

1058
01:34:20,183 --> 01:34:23,561
You want to be free and unattached.

1059
01:34:23,687 --> 01:34:27,357
To go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

1060
01:34:27,482 --> 01:34:29,275
My cause...

1061
01:34:30,986 --> 01:34:32,696
Paco...

1062
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:35,573
I felt so safe with you.

1063
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:37,867
So loving.

1064
01:34:48,545 --> 01:34:50,088
Stay with me, Laurie.

1065
01:34:53,425 --> 01:34:55,343
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No. No.

1066
01:35:07,022 --> 01:35:10,150
What do l... owe you for that?

1067
01:35:24,039 --> 01:35:25,373
Laurie!

1068
01:35:31,546 --> 01:35:33,673
What are you doing?

1069
01:35:37,719 --> 01:35:39,471
Do you want to walk away or should I?

1070
01:35:41,306 --> 01:35:42,766
I'm not gonna walk away.

1071
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,269
It's finished!

1072
01:35:54,277 --> 01:35:57,614
Who do you think you are pulling
that no testifying bullshit on me?

1073
01:35:57,739 --> 01:36:01,201
Chief Green, I know your reputation.

1074
01:36:01,326 --> 01:36:05,580
Look, maybe if you were borough
commander when this thing started,

1075
01:36:05,705 --> 01:36:09,334
running this investigation,
I'd feel different about testifying.

1076
01:36:09,459 --> 01:36:11,544
But you're coming in after the fact.

1077
01:36:11,669 --> 01:36:12,921
Cut the crap, Serpico.

1078
01:36:13,046 --> 01:36:16,091
You're like a quiff who says she won't,
then maybe she will, then she won't...

1079
01:36:16,216 --> 01:36:19,677
I'm like a quiff who's been fucked over
for a year and a half

1080
01:36:19,803 --> 01:36:22,847
by guys like Kellogg, McClain, Delaney...

1081
01:36:22,972 --> 01:36:25,683
I'm not Kellogg, McClain or Delaney.

1082
01:36:25,809 --> 01:36:30,188
Frank, it won't be just flunkey cops.
This is only the beginning.

1083
01:36:30,313 --> 01:36:33,149
This could be the biggest thing
since the Harry Gross case.

1084
01:36:33,274 --> 01:36:34,734
And meanwhile, where am I?

1085
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:37,195
I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?

1086
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:40,115
I'm totally isolated in the Department.
I don't have a friend.

1087
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:43,535
Don't give me that bullshit.
I've been putting cops away for 30 years.

1088
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:47,080
My name's an obscenity
in every precinct in the city.

1089
01:36:47,205 --> 01:36:50,166
- I've observed that, sir.
- "Friends."

1090
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:52,418
I fought my way up as a Jew in the days

1091
01:36:52,544 --> 01:36:55,463
when you were supposed to have
an uncircumcised shamrock.

1092
01:36:55,588 --> 01:36:59,175
I have this nightmare. I'm on Fifth Avenue
watching the St Patrick's Day Parade,

1093
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:03,221
I have a coronary and 9,000 cops
march happily over my body.

1094
01:37:03,346 --> 01:37:07,225
- I haven't got a friend on the Force either.
- I'll be your friend, Chief.

1095
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:10,145
I'm not looking for any.
I'll make an exception in your case.

1096
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:11,729
Frank, you're a good cop.

1097
01:37:11,855 --> 01:37:14,774
<i>Stop being a prima donna.
Just cut out the shticklech.</i>

1098
01:37:14,899 --> 01:37:19,279
I don't understand. How am I being
a prima donna? I want to protect myself.

1099
01:37:19,904 --> 01:37:25,451
Frank, if we're gonna get the indictments,
you're gonna have to testify.

1100
01:37:33,543 --> 01:37:36,754
<i>Ready on the right. Ready on the left.</i>

1101
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,090
<i>Ready on the firing line.</i>

1102
01:37:39,215 --> 01:37:40,341
(Buzzer)

1103
01:38:29,057 --> 01:38:32,477
What are you going to tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

1104
01:38:34,103 --> 01:38:36,022
Depends on what they ask me.

1105
01:38:36,147 --> 01:38:38,816
Suppose they ask you who's taking money.

1106
01:38:38,942 --> 01:38:42,612
- What I don't know I don't know.
- But you do know, Frank.

1107
01:38:43,696 --> 01:38:47,784
Frankie, I like you. I don't want
to see anything happen to you.

1108
01:38:47,909 --> 01:38:52,121
But you got to understand there are a lot
of people who could hurt you here.

1109
01:38:52,247 --> 01:38:55,833
I'm not saying it's going to happen,
I'm saying it could happen.

1110
01:38:55,959 --> 01:38:58,670
There's lots of ways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.

1111
01:38:58,795 --> 01:39:00,922
They can just not be there
when you need them.

1112
01:39:01,047 --> 01:39:04,175
If somebody comes at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

1113
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,469
Or they'll send you in first enough times

1114
01:39:06,594 --> 01:39:09,597
until finally one day you're gonna walk
in the wrong door.

1115
01:39:12,809 --> 01:39:15,436
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank.

1116
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:21,317
I have nothing more.
Does anyone have any further questions?

1117
01:39:21,442 --> 01:39:24,570
Er... yes. If I may, Mr Knowles. Thank you.

1118
01:39:24,696 --> 01:39:29,158
Officer Serpico came to the 7th Division
more than a year and a half ago.

1119
01:39:29,284 --> 01:39:32,704
All during that time,
the things he's told us were taking place.

1120
01:39:32,829 --> 01:39:38,001
Now, why didn't Officer Serpico report
these criminal activities long before,

1121
01:39:38,126 --> 01:39:40,753
- when he first encountered them?
- I'd like to answer that.

1122
01:39:40,878 --> 01:39:47,719
Mrs Crist's question I don't believe is
material or relevant to the present inquiry.

1123
01:39:47,844 --> 01:39:49,971
I'd like to answer that question.

1124
01:39:50,096 --> 01:39:53,599
Officer Serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way

1125
01:39:53,725 --> 01:39:57,854
or guilty of any infraction of the law -
quite the contrary.

1126
01:39:57,979 --> 01:40:01,232
District Attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

1127
01:40:01,357 --> 01:40:04,944
Very well, Mr Tauber. Officer Serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

1128
01:40:05,069 --> 01:40:07,947
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1129
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:12,618
Why didn't you tell him
about Delaney and Kellogg?

1130
01:40:12,744 --> 01:40:16,998
Frank, this was a grand jury about police
officers actively engaged in corruption.

1131
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:20,877
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

1132
01:40:21,002 --> 01:40:23,171
That's crap and you know it.

1133
01:40:23,296 --> 01:40:27,091
Even a dumb cop like me knows
a prosecutor can take a grand jury

1134
01:40:27,216 --> 01:40:28,801
anywhere it wants to take it.

1135
01:40:28,926 --> 01:40:31,429
You never let me anywhere near
the real problems.

1136
01:40:31,554 --> 01:40:34,766
Nothing about the bosses, the brass,

1137
01:40:34,891 --> 01:40:37,685
how corruption like this could exist
without anybody knowing about it.

1138
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:40,438
A few flunkey cops in the Bronx, that's it.

1139
01:40:40,563 --> 01:40:43,066
None of the shit
in Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan...

1140
01:40:43,191 --> 01:40:44,484
Don't forget Kansas City.

1141
01:40:44,609 --> 01:40:48,696
- "The biggest thing since Harry Gross"?
- All right!

1142
01:40:48,821 --> 01:40:54,077
Look, Frank. You've got guts. Integrity.

1143
01:40:54,202 --> 01:40:57,163
There's going to be
a detective's gold shield in this for you.

1144
01:40:59,665 --> 01:41:02,126
That's terrific. That's good.

1145
01:41:03,294 --> 01:41:06,881
Maybe this is what it's all about.
I should take my gold shield and forget it.

1146
01:41:07,006 --> 01:41:09,300
I know you've been through an ordeal, Frank.

1147
01:41:11,886 --> 01:41:15,223
I'm a marked man in this Department,
for what?

1148
01:41:15,348 --> 01:41:18,976
- I've already arranged a transfer for you.
- To where? China?

1149
01:41:30,655 --> 01:41:35,576
That takes a 14-shot clip.
You expecting an army?

1150
01:41:35,701 --> 01:41:37,620
No, just a Division.

1151
01:41:39,789 --> 01:41:44,127
Tauber, did you know I've had reports
about Serpico being a fag?

1152
01:41:44,252 --> 01:41:46,754
He used to hang out in the BCI washroom.

1153
01:41:46,879 --> 01:41:48,881
That's stupid, Commissioner, and you know it.

1154
01:41:50,883 --> 01:41:56,180
Commissioner, a gold shield for Serpico at
this time would convince a lot of people...

1155
01:41:56,305 --> 01:41:57,723
Not while I'm commissioner.

1156
01:42:16,826 --> 01:42:18,828
Commander's office?

1157
01:42:20,705 --> 01:42:22,748
It's down that corridor.

1158
01:42:25,585 --> 01:42:28,588
Hey, Serpico, do you know
what they're saying in the Bronx?

1159
01:42:29,172 --> 01:42:31,507
That you spilled your guts to the grand jury.

1160
01:42:32,383 --> 01:42:34,427
Say it isn't so, Serpico.

1161
01:42:36,429 --> 01:42:38,347
It isn't so.

1162
01:42:39,432 --> 01:42:41,767
We know how to handle guys like you.

1163
01:42:42,643 --> 01:42:44,228
I ought to cut your tongue out.

1164
01:42:46,481 --> 01:42:48,149
(Shouting)

1165
01:42:50,568 --> 01:42:52,236
Don't move.

1166
01:43:08,669 --> 01:43:10,463
(Knocking)

1167
01:43:14,217 --> 01:43:16,844
Officer Serpico reporting for duty, sir.

1168
01:43:24,685 --> 01:43:27,772
Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.

1169
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,859
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

1170
01:43:33,236 --> 01:43:35,071
Anybody in this command
you want to work with?

1171
01:43:40,117 --> 01:43:42,453
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

1172
01:43:45,122 --> 01:43:48,584
If you can't find anybody
you want to work with, Frank,

1173
01:43:48,709 --> 01:43:49,835
I'll work with you.

1174
01:43:51,045 --> 01:43:53,005
Is that all right?

1175
01:44:03,599 --> 01:44:06,519
- How do we get past the lookouts?
- How many you got?

1176
01:44:06,644 --> 01:44:07,687
One.

1177
01:44:10,064 --> 01:44:11,357
There's two.

1178
01:44:12,858 --> 01:44:14,068
There's three of them.

1179
01:44:15,486 --> 01:44:18,739
There's four buildings in one. We can
get down the fire escape, get in behind.

1180
01:44:18,864 --> 01:44:20,324
What do you think?

1181
01:44:21,450 --> 01:44:23,494
- Look good?
- Yeah, let's go.

1182
01:45:06,871 --> 01:45:10,583
- What do you think? Want to try it?
- Yeah.

1183
01:45:28,851 --> 01:45:31,145
- You all right?
- Yeah, I feel just like a cop again.

1184
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:33,314
Thank you.

1185
01:46:02,677 --> 01:46:04,303
Close up!

1186
01:46:06,889 --> 01:46:09,266
Frank, come on! Come on! Come on!

1187
01:46:26,534 --> 01:46:28,994
Get out of here. Get out. Go on.

1188
01:46:33,624 --> 01:46:36,127
What the hell's going on?
Who the hell are you?

1189
01:46:36,252 --> 01:46:38,254
The police. Who the hell do you think we are?

1190
01:46:38,379 --> 01:46:40,840
Get the fuck against the wall. Up! Up! Up!

1191
01:46:40,965 --> 01:46:42,800
- Let me see your shield.
- You want to see a shield?

1192
01:46:42,925 --> 01:46:44,677
All right. There's my shield.

1193
01:46:44,802 --> 01:46:47,263
- Where are you from?
- The Borough. Manhattan 8.

1194
01:46:47,388 --> 01:46:50,683
No, goddamn it! You're not!
I just paid the Borough this morning.

1195
01:46:50,808 --> 01:46:54,937
- Hey, Frank.
- What the hell kind of shakedown is this?

1196
01:46:55,062 --> 01:46:57,022
Who did you pay in the Borough?

1197
01:46:58,566 --> 01:47:01,110
Nobody. I didn't pay nobody.

1198
01:47:01,235 --> 01:47:03,112
Who did you pay in the Borough?

1199
01:47:03,237 --> 01:47:06,615
I didn't pay nobody. Now let go of me.

1200
01:47:07,491 --> 01:47:09,493
We followed up and, er...

1201
01:47:10,745 --> 01:47:12,329
there's no doubt about it and the...

1202
01:47:13,539 --> 01:47:15,040
The pad here in Manhattan

1203
01:47:15,166 --> 01:47:18,836
is bigger and more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

1204
01:47:18,961 --> 01:47:22,798
The, erm... the pick-ups here are made...

1205
01:47:22,923 --> 01:47:25,593
You want to get this?
The pick-ups are made by...

1206
01:47:26,927 --> 01:47:29,054
retired policemen.

1207
01:47:29,805 --> 01:47:33,517
That way no plain clothes men
are directly involved.

1208
01:47:33,976 --> 01:47:37,480
Now we need investigative help
on this one, Chief.

1209
01:47:39,398 --> 01:47:43,778
Well, Inspector, if you need investigative
help and you don't trust your own men,

1210
01:47:43,903 --> 01:47:47,072
why don't you requisition some recruits
from the Police Academy?

1211
01:47:55,164 --> 01:47:56,957
With all due respect, sir...

1212
01:47:58,834 --> 01:48:01,796
backing us up is the only hope
that the Police Department has got.

1213
01:48:01,921 --> 01:48:04,423
A lot of good cops would come forward
if they thought

1214
01:48:04,548 --> 01:48:06,634
there was any encouragement
in the department to do so

1215
01:48:06,759 --> 01:48:08,052
and if they thought it'd do any good.

1216
01:48:08,177 --> 01:48:10,095
But if there's no encouragement,
they're not gonna do it.

1217
01:48:10,221 --> 01:48:12,556
I've done a whole lot more than most people

1218
01:48:12,681 --> 01:48:15,100
to defend and reserve
the image of this Department

1219
01:48:15,226 --> 01:48:19,021
and protect Commissioner Delaney
against reckless and irresponsible assault

1220
01:48:19,146 --> 01:48:21,315
from outside agencies.

1221
01:48:23,025 --> 01:48:27,112
That's it, huh?
That's what's really important, is it?

1222
01:48:28,739 --> 01:48:30,866
That's what you want to know.

1223
01:48:30,991 --> 01:48:33,619
What outside agencies I've been to, right?

1224
01:48:34,703 --> 01:48:36,747
(Ringing tone) <i>- (Man) Hello?</i>

1225
01:48:36,872 --> 01:48:38,457
- Hello, prick.
- Who is this?

1226
01:48:38,582 --> 01:48:41,794
- Frank.
- Frank! How are you? Where are you?

1227
01:48:41,919 --> 01:48:43,629
Ready to go to the Times.

1228
01:48:44,296 --> 01:48:47,174
It's a goddamn serious step, Frank.

1229
01:48:48,551 --> 01:48:50,845
I don't know if the timing is right.

1230
01:48:53,889 --> 01:48:59,019
I want it to get on the record, that's all.
In case something should happen to me.

1231
01:49:02,690 --> 01:49:04,608
I want it on the record.

1232
01:49:07,736 --> 01:49:09,446
I don't know if we carry enough weight.

1233
01:49:10,948 --> 01:49:15,870
I don't know if the Times will go out on
a limb on the say-so of two flunkey cops.

1234
01:49:19,623 --> 01:49:22,543
Suppose an inspector were to come with us.

1235
01:49:23,627 --> 01:49:25,796
You know, I got 20 years on the Force.

1236
01:49:25,921 --> 01:49:30,593
We just got this place and signed
a 500-year mortgage on it.

1237
01:49:30,718 --> 01:49:33,721
- (Television blares)
- Will you turn that thing off out there!

1238
01:49:33,846 --> 01:49:36,265
- OK, come on. Everybody to bed.
- Oh, Mum!

1239
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:38,809
- Turn that damn thing down.
- Come on, now. Go on upstairs.

1240
01:49:39,268 --> 01:49:41,562
You said we could go to bed late!

1241
01:49:42,897 --> 01:49:45,941
This is against Department regulations.
You both know that.

1242
01:49:46,066 --> 01:49:49,278
If they want to throw the book at me
they can do it.

1243
01:49:50,446 --> 01:49:52,489
If I left the Force...

1244
01:49:53,866 --> 01:49:55,784
I don't know what I could do.

1245
01:50:01,582 --> 01:50:04,919
OK, I've made my little speech.
I'll back you up 100 per cent.

1246
01:50:09,882 --> 01:50:12,760
<i>Times and the News.
I got the money, fellas.</i>

1247
01:50:12,885 --> 01:50:14,929
There you go. There you go. There you go.

1248
01:50:15,054 --> 01:50:16,805
<i>Newsweek, please.</i>

1249
01:50:18,682 --> 01:50:20,476
Holy shit!

1250
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:27,691
Oh, Christ. You can almost predict
the numbers they're going to do.

1251
01:50:27,816 --> 01:50:29,985
Delaney's going to issue some phoney denial.

1252
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:32,947
Somebody from the Mayor's office
will say something noble.

1253
01:50:33,072 --> 01:50:35,449
Delaney will change his tune.

1254
01:50:35,574 --> 01:50:37,451
And finally, the Mayor
is gonna appoint a commission.

1255
01:50:37,576 --> 01:50:41,163
"Thursday Mayor Lindsay announced
the formation of a five-man committee

1256
01:50:41,288 --> 01:50:44,208
"to review the City procedures
when investigating police corruption."

1257
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:48,420
- How come I'm not in the first paragraph?
- Unbelievable!

1258
01:50:48,545 --> 01:50:51,840
Yihoo! Yihoo! Yihoo!

1259
01:50:52,967 --> 01:50:57,262
<i>The Times report smells
of the familiar smear tactics</i>

1260
01:50:57,388 --> 01:50:59,473
<i>of McCarthyism.</i>

1261
01:50:59,598 --> 01:51:03,352
I have issued a statement to be read
at every station...

1262
01:51:03,477 --> 01:51:06,814
The Mayor is appointing
a special investigation commission

1263
01:51:06,939 --> 01:51:09,650
<i>- to be headed by Whitman Knapp.</i>
- Yeah, come.

1264
01:51:15,155 --> 01:51:19,702
Here's your reward, Frank.
It's a transfer to Narcotics, Brooklyn South.

1265
01:51:20,786 --> 01:51:23,831
Still in Clothes.
You get a tin shield, not a gold one.

1266
01:51:28,711 --> 01:51:30,087
I miss you already, Frank.

1267
01:51:35,634 --> 01:51:37,177
Look...

1268
01:51:37,845 --> 01:51:39,763
Frank...

1269
01:51:41,598 --> 01:51:45,352
It's Narcotics. Be careful.

1270
01:51:47,021 --> 01:51:49,815
It's very easy to, erm... get hurt.

1271
01:51:51,817 --> 01:51:53,569
You know, to, er...

1272
01:51:55,029 --> 01:51:56,739
to be set up.

1273
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:24,224
(indistinct police radio)

1274
01:52:36,445 --> 01:52:37,654
Serpico!

1275
01:52:38,864 --> 01:52:40,866
Get in.

1276
01:52:57,591 --> 01:52:59,593
You're not wired, are you?

1277
01:53:01,053 --> 01:53:03,388
OK, you cocksucker.

1278
01:53:04,264 --> 01:53:07,142
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit,

1279
01:53:07,267 --> 01:53:10,854
but down here 800 a month is chicken feed.

1280
01:53:12,356 --> 01:53:17,402
Last week one dope dealer sent out
these guys making pick-ups.

1281
01:53:18,237 --> 01:53:20,656
40,000 each.

1282
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:24,368
We let them collect it all and then hit them.

1283
01:53:24,493 --> 01:53:27,955
120,000 split four ways.

1284
01:53:28,956 --> 01:53:31,083
That's serious money.

1285
01:53:31,208 --> 01:53:33,836
And with that, you don't fuck around.

1286
01:53:36,463 --> 01:53:38,382
I got the message.

1287
01:53:38,549 --> 01:53:41,468
Good. Now get the fuck out.

1288
01:53:48,225 --> 01:53:51,895
The guy's name is Limbo. He always uses
his girlfriend's brother's place.

1289
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:54,606
He's a pusher. Heroin.

1290
01:53:54,731 --> 01:53:58,861
We're going to drive round to the corner.
You keep in sight, out front.

1291
01:53:58,986 --> 01:54:02,614
When you spot somebody who's dirty,
you take off your glasses and wipe them.

1292
01:54:02,739 --> 01:54:04,700
Right. OK.

1293
01:55:13,894 --> 01:55:16,230
If we stay around here very long,
we'll get spotted.

1294
01:55:16,355 --> 01:55:19,983
Well, Frank, why don't you go up there
and check it out?

1295
01:55:20,108 --> 01:55:23,362
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

1296
01:55:23,487 --> 01:55:26,156
- I'll take you shopping.
- Uh-huh.

1297
01:57:02,419 --> 01:57:03,920
(Dog barking)

1298
01:57:09,968 --> 01:57:11,970
- (Knocking)
- Limbo?

1299
01:57:13,597 --> 01:57:15,432
(Speaks Spanish)

1300
01:57:45,462 --> 01:57:47,464
Police! Freeze!

1301
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:50,384
Police Officer. Up against the wall.
Get your hands up.

1302
01:57:52,344 --> 01:57:55,180
All right. Palms up on the wall
and spread them.

1303
01:57:55,305 --> 01:57:58,892
Get them up! Get your hands up!
Come on! Get your feet apart!

1304
01:57:59,810 --> 01:58:01,520
- I saw the buy.
- All right, let's get Limbo.

1305
01:58:01,645 --> 01:58:04,356
- Julio, you all right, baby?
- Yeah, I got them.

1306
01:58:48,442 --> 01:58:50,777
(Speaks Spanish)

1307
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:10,213
Police officer!

1308
01:59:13,383 --> 01:59:15,427
(Shouting in Spanish)

1309
01:59:20,223 --> 01:59:22,350
What the fuck are you waiting for?

1310
01:59:22,476 --> 01:59:24,436
(Continues in Spanish)

1311
01:59:41,369 --> 01:59:44,247
Police! Drop your guns
and come out with your hands up!

1312
02:00:19,866 --> 02:00:22,827
- What have we got here?
- It's Mr and Mrs Serpico, sir.

1313
02:00:22,953 --> 02:00:24,704
OK. Go ahead.

1314
02:00:28,124 --> 02:00:30,919
- Yes?
- Where's our son?

1315
02:00:31,044 --> 02:00:33,880
- They're bringing him down from X-Ray.
- We want to see him.

1316
02:00:34,005 --> 02:00:36,174
Just a few minutes.

1317
02:01:03,535 --> 02:01:08,081
Mr and Mrs Serpico,
the news is better than we expected.

1318
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:14,004
Thank God the bullet was a small calibre.

1319
02:01:14,129 --> 02:01:15,714
It didn't enter the brain.

1320
02:01:15,839 --> 02:01:19,426
- (Translates)
- Or strike the spinal cord.

1321
02:01:20,969 --> 02:01:23,346
He's on the critical list.

1322
02:01:23,471 --> 02:01:26,516
But his condition seems to be stable.

1323
02:01:28,018 --> 02:01:29,978
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

1324
02:02:03,845 --> 02:02:06,389
Stay out of there. Didn't they tell you?

1325
02:02:07,057 --> 02:02:10,268
- What?
- The word is don't talk to him.

1326
02:02:10,393 --> 02:02:12,354
He's no fucking good.

1327
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:23,948
- How you doing, kid?
- Hello, Sid.

1328
02:02:31,081 --> 02:02:32,874
Come over here.

1329
02:02:36,211 --> 02:02:38,755
Want to read my fan mail?

1330
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:42,092
Sure. You're a big shot now, huh?

1331
02:03:07,325 --> 02:03:09,369
Sid...

1332
02:03:11,246 --> 02:03:14,499
I want you to get those fucking cops
away from my door.

1333
02:03:25,427 --> 02:03:29,013
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

1334
02:03:29,139 --> 02:03:30,807
Naturally.

1335
02:03:34,894 --> 02:03:39,649
Frank, Heinemann and Julio are cleared.
You're up for exceptional merit awards.

1336
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:42,569
That's very funny.

1337
02:03:48,283 --> 02:03:50,326
That's very funny.

1338
02:03:51,870 --> 02:03:53,663
Francesco, you love me?

1339
02:03:55,915 --> 02:03:58,376
I always had a thing for you, Sid,
you know that.

1340
02:04:02,547 --> 02:04:04,799
Your gold shield's come through.

1341
02:04:33,536 --> 02:04:35,580
What's this for?

1342
02:04:39,042 --> 02:04:41,711
For being an honest cop?

1343
02:04:41,836 --> 02:04:43,254
Hm?

1344
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:47,175
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

1345
02:04:51,763 --> 02:04:54,682
You tell them they can shove it.

1346
02:05:00,396 --> 02:05:02,398
I don't want it.

1347
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:43,147
Oh, well.

1348
02:05:47,235 --> 02:05:49,487
Well, Frank, the facts are these.

1349
02:05:50,363 --> 02:05:54,158
You'll have to stay on leave of absence
for a few months.

1350
02:05:54,284 --> 02:05:57,912
In all probability, the hearing
in your left ear won't come back.

1351
02:05:58,037 --> 02:06:00,665
Two bullet fragments are still lodged there
in the bony portion.

1352
02:06:00,790 --> 02:06:02,670
One is very close to the carotid artery

1353
02:06:02,696 --> 02:06:05,153
<i>and you'll have to be checked from time to time.</i>

1354
02:06:05,253 --> 02:06:07,755
<i>Your left side will feel stiff occasionally.</i>

1355
02:06:08,798 --> 02:06:11,843
<i>Once in a great while you may experience
some dizziness.</i>

1356
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:15,013
<i>But in general, you'll be OK.</i>

1357
02:06:32,697 --> 02:06:34,782
Through my appearance here today,

1358
02:06:34,908 --> 02:06:36,951
I hope that police officers in the future

1359
02:06:37,076 --> 02:06:41,915
will not experience the same frustration
and anxiety that I was subjected to

1360
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:45,126
for the past five years
at the hands of my superiors

1361
02:06:45,251 --> 02:06:48,129
because of my attempt to report corruption.

1362
02:06:48,254 --> 02:06:53,009
I was made to feel that I had burdened
them with an unwanted task.

1363
02:06:53,134 --> 02:06:56,512
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist

1364
02:06:56,638 --> 02:07:00,892
in which an honest police officer can act
without fear of ridicule or reprisal

1365
02:07:01,017 --> 02:07:03,269
from fellow officers.

1366
02:07:03,394 --> 02:07:07,023
Police corruption cannot exist
unless it is at least tolerated

1367
02:07:07,148 --> 02:07:09,150
at higher levels in the Department.

1368
02:07:09,275 --> 02:07:12,487
Therefore the most important result
that can come from these hearings

1369
02:07:12,612 --> 02:07:16,908
is a conviction by police officers
that the Department will change.

1370
02:07:17,784 --> 02:07:22,038
In order to ensure this, an independent,
permanent investigative body

1371
02:07:22,163 --> 02:07:25,833
dealing with police corruption
like this commission, is essential.

1372
02:07:25,959 --> 02:07:28,294
