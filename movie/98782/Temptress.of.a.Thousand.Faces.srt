00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,750
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces!

2
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,500
Come in. Good to see you again

3
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,590
We have not seen you for a long time. Welcome

4
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Anything worth looking at?

5
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,120
Oh yes. Please take a seat

6
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,080
Take a look

7
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,920
This is our finest craftmanship

8
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,950
I'll take this one, this one...

9
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,680
and this one.

10
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,360
Certainly.

11
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,230
Come on, wrap them

12
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,720
Do you want to see more?

13
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,070
No need. What do I owe you?

14
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,160
Just a moment, please.

15
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,920
In all, it's 576,000.

16
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,640
I'll give you a discount...make it 570000.

17
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,910
Have a look please

18
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,800
Give him a cheque for 576,000

19
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,720
Please sign

20
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,480
Thank you

21
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,080
That's it

22
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,640
Goodbye now...Thank you

23
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,430
A big business deal in less then 5 minutes

24
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,720
Pay HK $ 576,000 Jewelry Jeane

25
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,000
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces!

26
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,950
Please, inside

27
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,520
Who are you looking for?

28
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,110
Sorry, no entry

29
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,950
My wife died this morning of a heart attack

30
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,640
Her heart was weak

31
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,830
But according to the report I have...

32
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,590
...she went shopping at Jewelry Jeane at around noon.

33
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,950
That's impossible.

34
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,230
Must be a case of mistaken identity

35
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,000
...or someone was impersonating her

36
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,760
Who?

37
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,190
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces!!

38
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,430
Extra!... Extra!

39
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,280
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces strikes again!!

40
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,550
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces strikes again!!

41
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,330
Yuk Dat

42
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,430
Is your girlfriend doing everything she can to catch this thief?

43
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,350
Be careful. The Temptress is sly and skillful

44
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,880
Yuk Dak's girl is a police officer. He has nothing to fear

45
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,110
But the woman thief is dangerous...Can your girl protect you?

46
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,990
Don't worry

47
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,330
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces is dead

48
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,440
I don't believe it

49
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,400
I went to her place this afternoon

50
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,010
Are you referring to Madam Kam?...She was not the Temptress

51
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,800
What do you know?

52
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,920
unless...you're the thief

53
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,230
Supervisor Kang
-Manager

54
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,350
How are you coming with your story on the Temptress

55
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,610
We're on it...We're working on it

56
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,590
Ladies and gentlemen, newspaper sales are way down

57
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,880
Our survival is at stake

58
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,270
Molly...How are you doing with your inside story of the Temptress

59
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,030
This is your responsibility. I want results soon!

60
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,270
I know. I'm sure I'll dig up something in a day or two

61
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,030
If you get the information, I'll reward you

62
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,560
Anything new on this woman thief?

63
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,200
No

64
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,040
You made a promise to your manager

65
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,630
How come you're concerned suddenly?

66
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,480
I'm always concerned about you

67
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
Really?

68
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,040
Aren't you worried Ji Ying will be jealous?

69
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm being serious

70
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,280
Can you do me a favour?

71
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,830
What's that?

72
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,050
Take some photos

73
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,570
Take photos?

74
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,475
Tonight

75
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,950
Do I look like the Temptress of a Thousand Faces?

76
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,080
Will this work?

77
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,330
Nobody has ever seen her anyway

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,990
Go ahead

79
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,640
"By our reporter,Molly"

80
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,880
"A REAL LOOK AT THE TEMPTRESS OF A THOUSAND FACES"

81
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,510
Are you looking for Yuk Dat? He's inside

82
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,540
No. I'm looking for you

83
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,870
Me?

84
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
The detective wants to see you

85
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,720
Start the car

86
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,360
Are you taking me to prison?

87
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,070
Nothing that serious

88
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,310
So what do you want?

89
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Your article on the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

90
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,560
has stirred up much public concern

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
So what's to be done?

92
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,790
We don't think your news is accurate

93
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,960
The Temptress is not as powerful as you say

94
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,520
If she weren't powerful...

95
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,350
...you would have caught her already

96
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,720
I will catch her one day

97
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,790
I hope so

98
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,640
We ask you to stop writing

99
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,520
your fictional articles

100
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,180
Is that what the detective wants to tell me?

101
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,030
Then I can get off?

102
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,880
We'll drop you off

103
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,040
Thanks, but there's no need

104
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,480
Although the Temptress of a Thousand Faces is sly

105
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,880
We must, for the good of society,

106
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
capture and punish this criminal

107
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,030
We must not let her operate outside the law

108
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,330
Her crimes must be punished

109
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,650
Hello...Hello?

110
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,790
Ji Ying, this is the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

111
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,840
What ? The Temptress of a Thousand Faces?

112
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,160
Yuk-Dat, stop fooling around

113
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,960
I am not joking. I AM the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

114
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,440
You are Ji Ying, I want to see you

115
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,480
Yuk-Dat, even if you impersonate a woman's voice

116
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
I know it's you...stop kidding with me

117
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,790
I am the Temptress of a Thousand Faces and I want to see you

118
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,630
What the hell?

119
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,710
You know who I am ?

120
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
Who are you ?

121
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,660
I am the Temptress of a Thousand Faces.

122
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,850
oh yes

123
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,870
You have the nerve to challenge me openly on TV?

124
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,960
You are a danger to society and a criminal

125
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,640
A Criminal ?

126
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,390
I suggest you turn yourself in

127
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,800
You must be dreaming

128
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,280
You'll see I mean business!!

129
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,840
Wake up.

130
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,840
Ji-ying

131
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,850
Ji-ying

132
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,240
What's the matter with you today?

133
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Me? What?

134
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,710
Yuk Dat, I must tell you something you won't believe

135
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,440
What is it ?

136
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,070
I met the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

137
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,190
What?

138
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,190
When ?

139
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,310
Last night

140
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,600
In a mysterious place

141
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,640
What are you laughing at?

142
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,630
I think you must be dreaming

143
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,320
Dreaming?

144
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,690
No, It wasn't a dream...honestly

145
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,810
You must be watching too much TV...it's giving you nightmares

146
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,200
Maybe.

147
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,600
Tell me what you've been dreaming of?

148
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,320
I dreamed that I was in a cave...

149
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,360
I was caught in a glass jar

150
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,190
I was spinning around

151
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,600
My hands touched a metal plate

152
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,760
which emmited smoke and then I fainted

153
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,320
It certainly was not a dream

154
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,510
It's real, you weren't dreaming

155
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,360
This is all of it...It's all here

156
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,390
Everything is there

157
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,400
Sorry, I'll go now. Excuse me

158
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:15,645
No...

159
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,130
I didn't...please don't

160
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,900
Attention. Night Wolf Number 2...Night Wolf Number 2

161
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,240
Take him away

162
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,910
What happened ?

163
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,810
Someone jumped

164
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,150
I think you are tired of living

165
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,430
You dare to spy on us

166
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,040
So what ?

167
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,330
Since you've got me, do whatever you like

168
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,200
You want to die? It's not that easy

169
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,790
What can you do to me?

170
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll let you know right now

171
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,480
What do you think of our layout here?

172
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,000
What's the big deal?

173
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,800
All these objects come from unlawful and devious means

174
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,230
There are many rich people in this world

175
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,910
They all cheat, lie and steal

176
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,680
None of them are honest

177
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,680
But they are not caught

178
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,830
because they find legal loopholes

179
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,800
Still...their actions cause harm to others

180
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,320
I feel what I do is relatively honest

181
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,220
You are twisting the facts

182
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,930
There is no absolute truth in this world

183
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,190
I was poor as a kid

184
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,960
No one pitied me

185
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,510
After I grew up

186
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,390
I was the play object of many men

187
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
That is why...

188
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,550
I want revenge!

189
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,470
But the way you do it....will not make anybody understand you

190
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,570
Well..do I look like you?

191
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,350
I am not a thug

192
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,070
But I'll make you one, and you'll lose your status in society

193
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,580
and your lover as well

194
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,560
Come in

195
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,200
I was going to call you

196
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,470
Where were you yesterday?

197
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,750
On a case

198
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,750
Have you finished?

199
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,030
I don't have a lead yet

200
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,800
You look especially beautiful today

201
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,750
Ji-ying

202
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,200
We can't go on like this

203
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,120
I know. If I had a little more money we could marry

204
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,110
If it's only money, then I could fix it...Let me handle it

205
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,390
That wouldn't be fair

206
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,310
As long as you are true to me...

207
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,200
...money is no object

208
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,680
Are you going to the fashion show tomorrow?

209
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,440
Of course

210
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,480
How about you?

211
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,790
I have to guard the jewelry that will be at the show

212
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,480
Be careful

213
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,160
Is Ji-Ling here?

214
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Inside

215
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,270
You two stand guard

216
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,980
Ji-ying, this set of jewelry is borrowed for the show

217
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,280
It's worth over 10 million, y'know

218
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,270
You have to guard it well

219
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,600
The show starts soon. Let's go take a look

220
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,680
The jewelry you see now...

221
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,760
...is courtesy of the Au Mei Jewelry company...

222
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,800
It is worth over 10 million

223
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,470
There are rare precious stones...

224
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,910
...for your appreciation

225
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,070
What??

226
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,830
There's smoke...what's happening?

227
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,230
Like my outfit?

228
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,710
Your make-up looks really good

229
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,040
I can't see

230
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,520
Don't move!

231
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,040
Come over here..all of you

232
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,440
Put all of your jewels in my bag

233
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,470
What's happening?

234
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,470
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces went out the window

235
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,550
What are you doing? Don't you know the jewels were stolen?

236
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,360
I'll settle with you later

237
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,280
The detective is inside

238
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,830
No...that's not her

239
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,600
That's not her

240
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,230
Looks a little like her

241
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,630
Detective, I discovered something

242
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,390
Wait

243
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,560
It's her! It's her!

244
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,360
Looks just like her

245
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,330
There she is! There she is! Right there!

246
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,320
Ji Ying, why have you done this?

247
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,750
Even you don't believe me

248
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,640
This ring belongs to us

249
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,070
No, this isn't mine

250
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
What do have to say now?

251
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,400
Take her away

252
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,760
It wasn't me

253
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,790
Wasn't you?...Well, where did you get that ring ?

254
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,420
I don't know

255
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,200
Speak up! Where did you get the jewels?

256
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,720
I told you..the Temptress of a Thousand Faces took my appearance

257
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,230
What can I do if you don't believe me?

258
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,360
Be honest and admit it

259
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,430
Admit what?

260
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,790
That you're the Temptress of a Thousand Faces.

261
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,560
"POLICE IDENTIFY THE MYSTERIOUS TEMPTRESS!!"

262
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,880
"It turns out to be woman police officer, Ji-Ying"

263
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,880
You are so stupid

264
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,000
To be in love with a woman thief

265
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,240
But...It would be great for you to marry her

266
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,280
You'll be rich

267
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,000
You can enjoy an exuberant life

268
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,020
Alright...shut up already, will you?

269
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,840
How can I go back looking like this?

270
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,940
I tripped...

271
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,520
Yuk Dat...help me up

272
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,940
You lousy Temptress of a Thousand Faces. Of all places to rob...you rob this place

273
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,440
...and get me demoted!

274
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,700
Hey back there...Don't you have anything better to do then stare at women's legs?

275
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,990
Without this robbery, the detective knows nothing

276
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,000
Hey...I hear the models are shapely and gorgeous

277
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,390
You're right...I know

278
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,360
Stop the car.

279
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,360
Come on...move!

280
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,000
Get off!

281
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,390
What?..What's she doing?

282
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,910
Stop her!!!

283
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,840
Detective

284
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,470
What's with you?

285
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,050
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces escaped on the way

286
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,240
Oh damn!

287
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,440
You idiots!!

288
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,880
Let's go out and enjoy ourselves

289
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,400
I'm not going

290
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,360
I need to rest

291
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,640
C'mon..let's go out and have some fun

292
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,590
I'm not going... I told you, I need to rest.

293
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,070
Yuk Dat...Yuk Dat

294
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,680
It's me...You don't love me anymore?

295
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,930
I do. But you're the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

296
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,150
Who are you calling?

297
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,150
The detective

298
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,350
You're nuts! I told you it wasn't me

299
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
It was you at the fashion show..You still deny that?

300
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,910
She's impersonating me

301
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,210
I don't believe you

302
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,470
Now I guess you believe me

303
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,310
You are Ji Ying. You kiss like before

304
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,000
Weren't you caught?

305
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,920
I escaped on the way

306
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
The detective will pursue you

307
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,000
You're right

308
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,750
Why don't you knock?

309
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,830
Sorry to intrude on you this way

310
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,000
Temptress of a Thousand Faces, go with me to the police station

311
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,030
Go turn around

312
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,320
Get out

313
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,160
Oh sure..We go out and you let her escape

314
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,080
No...

315
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,950
You're mistaken

316
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,320
She isn't the criminal you think she is. She's Ji-Ying

317
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,560
You have no proof

318
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,360
Let's go

319
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,390
Fool detective

320
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,500
Got to think of...

321
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,960
...there must be a way

322
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,400
I like this color

323
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,960
Don't move!

324
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,860
What?

325
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,080
If you move, I'll shoot

326
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,640
Quickly!

327
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,310
She's the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

328
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,080
So sorry

329
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,560
Thief!...Grab her...don't let her go

330
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,640
Grab her...Stop her

331
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,990
Don't let her get away

332
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,360
Don't move..

333
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:25,930
Oh my...sorry

334
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,740
Why you....

335
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,800
Grab her! Grab her!

336
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,880
Don't let her get away! Stop her!

337
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,160
She's that 1000 Face Temptress. Get her!

338
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,150
You have no evidence to prove your innocence

339
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,670
Unless there's another Temptress of a Thousand Faces

340
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,840
You can't prove your innocence

341
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,510
Detective, there are several ladies to see you

342
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,480
We've been robbed!

343
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,720
Calm down. Quiet!

344
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,390
Please describe the thief

345
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,200
This is her card

346
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,720
The Temptress of a Thousand Faces?

347
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,580
Detective, this is for you

348
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,600
Where did you get this?

349
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,960
A kid brought it and left

350
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,010
It's mine...It's mine

351
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,730
Stand back

352
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,790
"Greetings detective, from the Temptress of a Thousand faces"

353
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,760
Detective, what should we do?

354
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,240
Give it back...

355
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,160
Stop. Be quiet

356
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,310
Please ladies. Calm down

357
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,280
You asked me what to do, right?

358
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,200
Yes

359
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,160
Release Ji-ying right now !

360
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,930
Sure, sure... Come

361
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,010
Careful

362
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,550
I'll help you

363
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,520
Thank you

364
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,400
Jump over

365
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,130
Right!

366
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,470
Ji ying, you're very smart...

367
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,920
Who did you get to rob the fashion boutique by impersonating you?

368
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,590
What? I thought it was you

369
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,380
I'm not that dumb, to have you arrested...

370
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,470
...then clear your name

371
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,350
But then who could it be?

372
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,710
Yuk Dat

373
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,440
Oh...You wish!...But maybe your right about that

374
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,760
Ji Ying, wouldn't you like to know what he's doing right now?

375
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,950
Go and see for yourself

376
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,510
He knew you'd be released

377
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,020
Now he's waiting for you

378
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,070
I'll go see him on your behalf

379
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,400
Ji-ying

380
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,620
I have waited so long for you

381
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,280
You knew I was free?

382
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,390
I just created a stir impersonating that vamp

383
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,150
That way they'd be forced to let you go

384
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,990
You're really great

385
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,350
You're a fool

386
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,480
He wouldn't be so nice, if he knew you're the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

387
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,310
I know you're not the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

388
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,500
Yuk Dat

389
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,030
You're so good to me

390
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,240
I love you

391
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,960
Dumb fool, stupid fool!

392
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,910
Welcome miss...hop in my car

393
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,350
C'mon baby

394
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,800
Yuk Dat, you've been tricked

395
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,410
Who is she ?

396
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,250
The real Temptress of a Thousand Faces

397
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,850
No...she is!

398
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,520
Right, you're the real Ji Ying

399
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,560
Watch out!

400
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,600
Yuk Dat, why aren't you helping me?

401
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,610
Yuk Dat, come and help me

402
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:58,080
I can't tell who's the real one

403
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,240
Hello?...is this the police station?..I need the detective

404
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,350
We can't let her escape

405
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,630
Over there

406
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,230
She escaped, let's go get her

407
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,320
Alright

408
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,000
Turn around!

409
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,840
If you find a black sedan, license plate number 4322..

410
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,810
that's license plate number 4322...Intercept it immediately!

411
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,760
Stop the car

412
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,000
Checkpoint

413
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,320
Put on the mask of the detective

414
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,920
Alright. OK. Move along now

415
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,360
Officers reporting. We got your orders

416
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,250
See any suspicious vehicles?
-No

417
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,450
Stay alert!

418
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,840
What happened?

419
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,670
What's going on?

420
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,160
You passed by just before, then how come...

421
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,710
Fakes!...Can't fool me this time

422
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,850
What are you doing?

423
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,120
Alright, Temptress of a Thousand Faces

424
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,360
I've been demoted twice thanks to you

425
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:57,160
You're now impersonating the detective

426
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,640
I will not fall for it. Put up your hands

427
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,830
Get out...

428
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,570
Get out

429
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,760
This is my identity card

430
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,430
Detective

431
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:22,360
Those were the imposters

432
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,800
The woman who looked liked me...That's the real Temptress of a Thousand Faces

433
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:26,560
They just passed by

434
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,520
I'll see you after I've arrested the woman thief

435
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,200
After them

436
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,110
Oh no! Another demotion

437
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,880
Step on it. They're gaining on us

438
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,070
Please...A little faster

439
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,840
Go untie the boat

440
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,690
Ji-ying

441
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,960
So she's the one

442
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,990
Molly...give yourself up

443
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,870
Throw away the gun and come out

444
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,430
Everybody..grab your guns!!

445
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,350
Don't move

446
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,720
Man, you're quite a pair together

447
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,990
You'll die together as well

448
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,000
Get away fast. The bomb's going to explode

449
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,240
Ji-ying

450
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:45,360
Don't come near, please!

451
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,990
Thanks for saving my life

452
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,840
I almost blew it

453
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:13,510
Let's catch the Temptress of a Thousand Faces

454
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,500
Don't move... Don't move

455
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,760
Hold it. Hand's up.

456
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,280
Molly... it's you

457
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,640
Free us, please... Let go of us
