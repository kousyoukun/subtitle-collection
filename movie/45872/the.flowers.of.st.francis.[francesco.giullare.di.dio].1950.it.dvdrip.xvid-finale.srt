7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,950
Praise be to Thee, my Lord,
through all Thy creatures...

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,193
... especially brother Sun,
who illuminates the day.

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,878
And beautiful is he and radiant
with great splendor.
(FRANCIS, GOD'S JESTER)

10
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,878
Of thee, most High,
he bears the likeness.

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,828
Praise be my Lord, for
sister Moon and for the stars.

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,634
In heaven, Thou hast formed
them luminous, precious and fair.
A Rizzoli production

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
Praise be my Lord,
for brother Wind,

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,870
... and for the air and clouds,
and all the weather...

15
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,389
... through which you give
all Thy creatures nourishment.
Inspired by the "Fioretti" of San Francesco

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,669
Praise be my Lord,
for sister Water,

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,320
... she is greatly helpful,
humble, precious, and pure.

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,756
Praise be my Lord,
for brother Fire...
Interpreted by non-professional actors

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,634
... through whom Thou
illuminate the night...
The role of The Tyrant Nicolaio
played by Aldo Fabrizi,

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,274
... and who is fair, cheerful,
powerful and strong.

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,635
Praise be my Lord,
for our sister, Mother Earth,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,760
who sustains us
and governs us...

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,070
and brings forth diverse fruits
with colored flowers and herbs.

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,038
Praise be my Lord,
for those who forgive for Thy love...

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,908
... and bear suffering and trial.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,560
Blessed those who
shall in peace endure,

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,275
... for by Thee, most High,
they will be crowned.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,236
Praise be my Lord,
for our sister, bodily death

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,354
... from whom no living
man can escape.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,477
Woe to them who
die in mortal sin.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,960
Blessed be those who she
finds in Thy most holy will,

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,669
... for the second death
shall not harm them.
God hath chosen the foolish things
of the world to confound the wise,

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,436
Praise and bless my Lord,
and the weak things of the world
to confound the things that are mighty

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,869
... and serve him
with great humility.
Paul. I Corinthians, 2:27

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,035
To conquer the world,
Francesco became humble

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,995
and a clown to merit
the Kingdom of Heaven.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,556
Everyone mocked him and said
he was mad.

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,280
But Pope Innocent III let him
preach to the people,

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,560
his faith in gentleness
and poverty.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,636
Now Francesco is returning from
Rome with his companions.

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,795
Their hut is occupied. They go on
to Santa Maria degli Angeli.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,030
From there they will take
to the world

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,716
the power of their meekness
and their sweet love of peace.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,754
"If I were preaching,
I'd begin like this:"

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,311
I've come to tell you a big
secret that will make you happy.

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,718
I'll teach you how to find
real peace.

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,439
And joy!

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,230
And joy! Because joy and peace
are what men most desire.

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,315
I'd talk of glory. We should have
the spirit of the perfect knight.

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,271
He wishes us to preach the
word of God with charity.

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,831
Ardor springs from a heart
full of joy.

52
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,196
I think a Christian should
love to struggle.

53
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,989
It's great to struggle for
a cherished dream.

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,392
You mean virtue? The joy I mean
is what the soul has

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,633
when it can dominate the
passions that trouble it.

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,517
Remember how calm it was
those starry nights

57
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,592
when dreams enchanted our youth?

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,958
Then the weather broke the spell
that could have harmed us.

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,353
Now the Pope has blessed us, we
must make known this new reality.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,477
The joy we feel today
is from this struggle...

61
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,359
which divine Providence
has inspired us to.

62
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,308
But why, Brother Bernardo, don't
you show us how to behave

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,995
to achieve such peace of soul?

64
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,829
You should imitate Christ in His
poverty and humility!

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,476
Let there be joy! Let there be glory!

66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,519
Let people rediscover the
joy of loving!

67
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,199
Slowly, brother. Were you thirsty?

68
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,239
But why you? Why you?

69
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,198
What do you mean?

70
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,114
Why does everyone follow
you, Francesco?

71
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,955
Why do they all want to see you,
hear you, and obey you?

72
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,793
You're not tall, handsome, or noble!

73
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,193
Because God could find no lower
creature on earth

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:02,192
nor a sinner worse than I,
in order to show that all virtue

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,508
and good comes from Him, not us.
Glory be His name for all eternity!

76
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,309
That's why I follow you,
too, Francesco!

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,233
Someone's in there.

78
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,430
- What do you want?
- We need to rest, brother.

79
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,990
Bring my donkey back in.
I'll give you rest!

80
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,315
- But we built this hut ourselves.
- Now it's mine.

81
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,440
That is hardly charitable.

82
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,160
Save your breath. Get out!

83
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,832
I'll teach you to bother me!
Get out, you thieving bastards!

84
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,433
Come, Bernardo, Leone
lambs of the good Lord, come!

85
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,354
- Now where do we go?
- I know.

86
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,436
Shouldn't we be rejoicing
in our hearts?

87
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:43,313
It's the first time Providence has
made us useful to someone else.

88
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,037
Father, what's bothering you?

89
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,193
God forgive me for
abusing your obedience. Bernardo,

90
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,189
I command you, on your holy vows,
to do what I ask.

91
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,317
I'll obey you, I will do
all you ask.

92
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,236
What must I do?

93
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,550
You must punish my pride.

94
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:05,434
I'll lie down. Step on my face and
neck, saying:

95
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,317
"Lie there, wretch

96
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,439
whose pride imposes penance
on his brothers!"

97
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,995
The joy in our faces is your best
answer to God.

98
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,119
We're beginning to love
our vocation!

99
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,310
Now we see by following you,
we follow God.

100
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,710
Thank you, brothers.

101
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,718
The Lord is always good to me.

102
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,196
How brother Ginepro returned naked
to Santa Maria degli Angeli

103
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,990
where the brothers had finished
building their hut.

104
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,274
Ah! How I long to go and preach!

105
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,954
Brother, this work brings you
ever nearer to God.

106
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,749
If you work with your hands,
you know life deeply.

107
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,152
Put thought into each stone,
and each will magnify you.

108
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,195
What a lovely present!

109
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,477
What shall we do with them?
Now we need some sheep!

110
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,033
- Who gave them to you?
- A benefactor.

111
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,550
Let's put them on the altar!

112
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,068
At last we have bells to
call us to prayer.

113
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,072
We've another surprise! We've
finished our house. Come and see!

114
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,993
It's a bit cramped.

115
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,997
Brother Ginepro, what happened?

116
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,116
I gave my habit to a beggar.

117
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,157
But you mustn’t give away your habit.

118
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,039
Didn't you tell us to help the poor?

119
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,871
I command you not to give away
your habit again!

120
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,634
How Giovanni The Simple asked
to follow Francesco,

121
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,237
and imitate him in
gesture and word.

122
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,436
Francesco, we're setting out.

123
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,228
Father, help me form these sons
into a new and humble people.

124
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,032
May this new time be like that which
saw your Son's meekness.

125
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,118
Let there be peace among men.

126
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,628
In the name of the Lord,
go in meekness and honesty.

127
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,032
Pray God in your hearts, and
shun empty words and deeds.

128
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,517
Each one help the other.

129
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,911
If you come across anyone who
needs you, forget everything else.

130
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:24,279
If you don't help others on earth,
you can't hope for God's reward.

131
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,151
Brothers, take care not to waste
the most precious gift of time

132
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,517
nor appear lazy
in others' eyes.

133
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,750
I want my brothers to do honest work
and not burden others.

134
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,788
Make those who don't know the Gospels
learn from your example.

135
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,957
As Ginepro has no clothes, he
will cook you a nice dinner.

136
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,158
We'll bring him a silken habit.

137
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,038
Farewell until this evening.
- We'll spread joy!

138
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,068
Lord, make me an instrument
of your peace.

139
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,354
Let me bring love where there is hate,
unity where there is discord.

140
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,750
Let me bring joy where there is pain,
and hope where there is despair.

141
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,228
Make me love, not wish for love.

142
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,389
And let all on earth know the
secret of your peace

143
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,677
which is the fruit of justice
and fraternal charity.

144
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,034
Sing a little quieter.

145
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:54,037
Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed
be thy name, thy kingdom come

146
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:07,476
Little brothers, who praise God so
easily, because you fly so freely

147
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,438
now let me, too,
praise God in peace.

148
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,634
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven

149
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,559
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

150
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,468
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

151
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,756
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. So it is.

152
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,918
Anyone there?

153
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,396
What do you want, brother?
- Oh, you're beautiful!

154
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,033
What do you want?

155
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,394
To speak to your leader.

156
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,834
Speak to me, it's the same.

157
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,673
I want to join Francesco.

158
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,672
And the bull?

159
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,269
It's for the brothers.

160
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,549
That's ours. Grandpa's gone mad.
We can't give away a cow.

161
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,072
- I'll see to the old man.
- Yes, you keep him.

162
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,319
Here we walk with Jesus
and the Madonna.

163
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,477
- Can you pray?
- I know the Hail Mary.

164
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,592
See how beautiful! Do you like it?
We always pray here.

165
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,116
- Do you like them?
- Beautiful.

166
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,669
The lamp is out. Well, we'll
light it tomorrow.

167
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,470
- What are you doing?
- The oil is beautiful.

168
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,158
Let us pray.

169
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,190
How peaceful it is.
This is where we sleep.

170
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,236
The fire is dying.

171
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,557
Beautiful fire!

172
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,036
Why stint brother Fire?

173
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,478
I love him because he's
beautiful and strong.

174
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,948
Praise God for brother Sun by day
and brother Fire by night.

175
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,554
But father, fire can hurt you.

176
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,950
And you, why do you want to hurt
brother Fire?

177
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,552
Father, let me do it.

178
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,037
- Why aren't the others back yet?
- Be patient, they'll come.

179
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,671
I want to be like Francesco.

180
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,516
But why did you leave your wife
and children? Were they unkind?

181
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,750
No, I want to be like Francesco.

182
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,677
With us, you must work harder still.
Your family must be as dead to you.

183
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,355
You must be humble and pray.

184
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,356
Will it not be hard to leave your
family? What do you want of Francesco?

185
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,636
I want to be a saint like him.

186
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,950
I am Francesco!

187
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,670
Let's go out.

188
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,236
Your new brothers are returning
from a day's work.

189
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,269
This is our new brother.

190
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,635
So many gifts from God!
- Take these, Ginepro!

191
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,676
Sister Chiara sent this habit
for brother Ginepro. It's been so long,

192
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,912
and she wants to eat with you.
May she come here?

193
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,199
Do you think I should let her?

194
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,157
So, tell sister Chiara we await her.

195
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,153
Here, Ginepro. God never abandons
those who serve Him.

196
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,797
Why are you so sad?

197
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,670
We are great sinners. The Lord
wouldn't grant us alms today.

198
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,992
Never fear, those who do their duty
will never go in want.

199
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,674
What our brothers brought back
is for all of us.

200
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,996
Look, we have a new brother!

201
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,674
His name's Giovanni.

202
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,236
Santa Chiara's wonderful meeting,

203
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,234
with San Francesco at
Santa Maria degli Angeli.

204
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,315
- We'll never do it!
- Don't worry, we have time.

205
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,557
Don't break the branches,
just take the flowers.

206
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,829
- Want to climb onto my shoulders?
- Lf you steady me.

207
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,431
And we thought we had nothing.
Pick plenty for sister Chiara.

208
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,353
We're making a beautiful carpet.
Smell it!

209
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,551
Good. Let's prepare a house fit for
a girl consecrated to God.

210
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,232
Go trim your beard!

211
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,832
Take the buckets.

212
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,440
- And you?
- Father, I don't have to shave.

213
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,474
Now we'll clean you up.

214
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,958
Ack! That hurts.
- Gently, gently.

215
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,756
She is coming!

216
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,758
Sister Chiara's coming!

217
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,552
Hello sister Chiara!
Hello sister Chiara!

218
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,631
So many memories!

219
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,872
Sister Chiara consecrated herself to God
in this chapel.

220
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,792
She's beautiful.

221
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,396
He took my cloak!

222
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,233
Hush! Brother Ginepro has no clothes.

223
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,350
Didn't Francesco order you not to give
your habit away again?

224
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,396
Yes, but I met a man who begged
in God's name.

225
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,195
I couldn't give him this ricotta,
so I said:

226
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,593
"I have only this habit, and I have
sworn not to give it away

227
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:03,233
but if you take it off my back
I won't stop you."

228
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,675
That's my cloak

229
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,909
Be charitable. He was naked,
we covered him.

230
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,756
Take this to a needy brother.

231
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,116
You take it, please.

232
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,991
Last night the devil visited me again.

233
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,236
But he went away unhorned, because
I've a simple way to drive him off,

234
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,353
When he's near, I rush to close
the door to my heart,

235
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,239
and envelop myself in
holy meditation.

236
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,517
So when he knocks,
I reply from within:

237
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,548
"Keep out, evil one, there's no room
for you here!"

238
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,997
Defeated, the devil leaves me,
and the land.

239
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,193
My God!

240
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,833
And the people of Assisi saw
the horizon red with fire.

241
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,999
They ran to Santa Maria degli Angeli
thinking it was burning.

242
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:18,478
The sky was alight with glowing words
of love from God, Chiara, and Francesco.

243
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,076
How brother Ginepro cut off a pig's
trotter to give to a sick brother.

244
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,149
I always have to stay here.

245
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,556
But that's fine.

246
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,437
One of our brothers is weak from
too much fasting.

247
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,273
I've made soup. Will it do him good?
Doesn't it smell good?

248
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,637
I doubt he can eat it,
but I'll take it to him.

249
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,873
Brother, I've made food
that'd raise the dead.

250
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,596
Thank you, brother.

251
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:46,517
In your condition, you shouldn't fast.
Father Francesco would order you to eat.

252
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,354
I do not fast to mortify my flesh.

253
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,833
You fast too much. I know what
you would like.

254
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,150
A leg of chicken.

255
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,198
Or a trout, some sausages,

256
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,079
a fresh egg and ricotta.

257
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,278
So, what would you like?

258
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,115
It’d be a big comfort if you'd
bring me a pig's trotter.

259
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,748
Leave it to me.
I'll go and find one.

260
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,431
He wouldn't eat but
he wants a pig's foot.

261
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,113
Where?

262
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,829
With God's help I'll find a pig
who'll offer me his trotter.

263
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,598
Give me the knife.

264
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,037
Let's trust in God.

265
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,672
Brother piglets, the Lord has sent
you to help me.

266
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,991
Brother pig, please listen.

267
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,157
You who are the most beautiful

268
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,198
give your succulent trotter
for a sick brother?

269
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,074
It won't hurt. The Lord will help us.

270
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,790
Think, little brother, how rarely
we can do good!

271
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,034
Thank you, Lord, for the good
the pig and I can do.

272
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,751
You found one!

273
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,592
Listen, he's also thanking the Lord!

274
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,028
I've brought you a trotter.

275
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,357
What a lovely smell!

276
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,358
Robbers! Thieves! You cut off my pig's
leg! That's what you call doing good?

277
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,433
Calmly, brother. What is it?

278
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,798
One of you cut off my pig's leg.

279
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,473
- Forgive us. Did you see who did it?
- No, or I'd have cracked his skull.

280
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,991
You've done it again!
You're a simpleton.

281
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,312
But, I did something good.

282
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,994
What made you do such a thing?

283
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,315
Brother pig and I were only doing good.
The pig was happy, too, wasn't he, Giovanni?

284
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,589
I command you to run and beg
that man's pardon,

285
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,916
and promise we won't
trouble him again.

286
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,189
Don't be stingy with your repentance!

287
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,871
What a forest of hair!

288
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,952
A lovely forest for God!

289
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,155
You needn't feel sorry for
brother pig

290
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,871
because he helped my sick brother.

291
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,192
To help a sick brother!

292
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,750
Aren't you pleased?

293
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,153
Eat it, you vagabonds! But if I see
you again, I'll flay you!

294
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,196
I told you I'd soothed him.

295
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,195
We can give it to the poor!

296
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,874
Yes, I'll see to it.

297
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,871
How San Francesco, praying in the
forest at night, met the leper.

298
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,078
My God, my all!

299
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,239
God, crucified
My brothers and I love you.

300
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,277
Crucified

301
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,395
My God!

302
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,759
How brother Ginepro cooked
food for fifteen days

303
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,597
and Francesco, touched by his zeal,
gave him permission to preach.

304
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,758
I've got an idea!

305
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,197
Now that we have so much food

306
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,110
let's cook it all at once, then
it'll last fifteen days,

307
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,949
So we'll be able to go
and preach, too!

308
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,358
I think Francesco will be happy, too.

309
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,029
And also the poor.

310
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,599
Where will we find a big enough pot?

311
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,876
Ask the shepherds.

312
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:12,036
Good idea. I'll go and look, with God's help.
- And for Francesco.

313
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,795
Help me. Put in lots of greens.

314
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,031
Get the wood now.

315
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,669
- What are you doing?
- The wood.

316
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,756
No, put the vegetables in!

317
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,439
Ginepro, the fire is dying,
bring more wood!

318
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,916
Ginepro's cooking tonight.

319
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,433
Don't put the wood in,
you'll ruin it!

320
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,356
Francesco! Beautiful Francesco!

321
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,795
I'm making dinner for fifteen days,
so we can all go preaching.

322
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,757
The chicken in this soup
will nourish us,

323
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,755
then we can forget about meals,
we can preach!

324
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,032
Come here, Ginepro.

325
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,199
You may preach, but I command you to
begin your sermons thus:

326
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,796
"Baa, baa, baa, much I say,
little I do."

327
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,072
For it is better to preach with
example than with words.

328
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,398
How brother Ginepro was
sentenced to death,

329
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,075
and how his humility conquered the
ferocity of the tyrant Nicolaio.

330
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,389
Let me have a go. Sit on the other end.

331
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,991
Where did you get the helmet?

332
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,515
Nicolaio's soldiers left it.
The tyrant is besieging Viterbo.

333
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,638
- Since when?
- Three months.

334
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,190
He's still there? I must seize
this opportunity.

335
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,749
He'll win again.

336
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,354
No, he's got less blood than I have.

337
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:16,914
- I bet he can't fill the cup.
- I bet he can.

338
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,030
Baa, baa, baa, much I say,
little I do.

339
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,436
Thank you, Lord. Finally
I understand,

340
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,912
that souls are won not by words,
but by example.

341
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,710
- What's happening?
- A game.

342
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,110
Let's go and watch!

343
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,518
What's going on?

344
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,998
They're having fun with a beggar.

345
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,754
Bring him here.

346
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,911
Search him.

347
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,598
An awl and a flint.

348
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,311
Beat him, then kill him.

349
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,399
I'll try it.

350
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,310
What have you done to this damned
armor? It's digging into my neck.

351
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,397
Do something, you dogs!

352
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,592
The last time you cut off the feet
instead of the head.

353
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,357
Will you kill him without a Priest
of his faith?

354
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,071
Call that one who buries the bodies.

355
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,518
Why a Priest? He'll die, anyway.
Give him some wine instead.

356
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:25,151
Play music. He'll manage to die,
just the same.

357
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,349
Such a little mouse! Trying
to kill our leader!

358
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,475
Go away.

359
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,837
My son, I bring you the comfort
of our faith.

360
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,914
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

361
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,235
Who are you?

362
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,072
A sinner.

363
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,117
What sins?

364
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,396
Many, many!

365
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,114
- Where are you from?
- Assisi.

366
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,108
Your name?

367
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,077
Ginepro. Why?

368
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,800
Do you follow,

369
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,157
that Francesco who's gentle
like a mother?

370
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,356
And meek as a lamb.

371
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:38,436
In God's name! I know this boy, he's
a friend of all. I'll talk to Nicolaio.

372
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:57,398
Lord Nicolaio, an injustice!
They're killing an innocent!

373
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,996
What's that? What do you want?

374
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:08,280
Nibbio, raise this visor!
Raise it at once!

375
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,518
What innocent?

376
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,955
The man you just condemned.

377
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,955
That worm threatened my life.
Nibbio, show him the instruments.

378
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:27,838
But this is to make fire, and the
awl is for mending his sandals.

379
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,952
A spy warned me of an assassin with
such tools, dressed like a beggar.

380
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,159
This is a devilish conspiracy!

381
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,074
No, I know him.

382
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,439
He is a follower of Francesco, a poor
man - the son of a rich man.

383
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,955
He gave everything to the poor,
and lives with companions

384
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,873
in a forest, free as birds.

385
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,875
Many follow him, because he loves
even the lowly.

386
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,715
He who despises the world is full of
hate, and thus, poisonous.

387
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,519
No, does not Aristotle say that,

388
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:13,837
he who despises the world does so
to protect himself from pain?

389
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,269
The poor are all the same. They preach
poverty, rob you, then slit your throat.

390
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:28,120
No! They refuse everything.
They're incapable of doing harm.

391
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,474
So, bring him here. I want
to question him.

392
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:01,515
Tell me, who are you?
- I'm a very great sinner.

393
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,991
Take off this helmet, Nibbio!

394
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,230
Would you betray us to Viterbo?

395
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,833
I'm the greatest traitor,
unworthy of anything.

396
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:41,232
Were you going to kill me with that
awl, and set fire to the camp?

397
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,592
I?

398
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,199
I'm a very great sinner.

399
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,153
I'd do worse things

400
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,709
if God didn't protect me.

401
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,316
If this is Ginepro

402
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,472
what must Francesco be like?

403
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,991
See the truth in his words!

404
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,638
Before God, we're always guiltier
than others can tell,

405
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,952
because we are not grateful
to God

406
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,557
and because we do not love
our fellow men.

407
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,712
We would be even more guilty

408
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,715
but for the help of merciful God.
- I don't understand this talk.

409
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,190
Nor I. Get this armor off me!

410
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,154
Take him to my tent.

411
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,749
Sound the call!

412
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,033
End the siege!

413
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,591
How brother Francesco taught
brother Leone

414
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,116
what perfect happiness is.

415
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:57,799
Brother Leone, lamb of God, even if
we could make the blind see

416
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,112
the deaf hear, exorcise demons,

417
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,195
and raise the dead - this
is not perfect happiness.

418
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,874
Did you see? He was after my
gold, but I punished him.

419
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,028
Brother, is a little gold
worth a man's life?

420
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,350
Here, take this coin.

421
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,318
Rest in peace.
- Amen.

422
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,474
O brother Leone, lamb of God,

423
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:36,236
even if we knew the language of
the angels, the soul's secrets,

424
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,034
this is not perfect happiness.

425
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:46,750
Even if we could predict the future,
and know nature's secrets,

426
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,559
this is not perfect happiness.

427
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:58,237
Were we to convert all to Christ,
this is not perfect happiness.

428
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,158
Tell me, where is perfect happiness?

429
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,194
Oh, here's a house. Let's see if
they'll praise Christ with us!

430
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,910
God, in his mercy, will surely show us
where perfect happiness is.

431
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:50,074
Be charitable, brother. We poor monks
roam the world for love of others.

432
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,910
We'll help you serve Jesus.

433
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,516
Serve Jesus with us!

434
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,998
Go away! Stop bothering people!

435
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,756
Brother, be charitable!
Serve Jesus, brother!

436
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,756
I'll give you Jesus! Get out, thieves!

437
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:57,472
I'll be generous! I'll give you
every inch of this stick of mine!

438
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:07,391
If you want more, come back and
disturb a man in his own house.

439
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:21,233
Brother Leone, lamb of God, now that
we've suffered all this for Christ

440
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,198
it is perfect happiness.

441
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:30,000
Above all the graces which Christ gives
His followers is the grace to conquer oneself

442
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,038
and to endure suffering for love of Him.

443
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,192
Only in this is perfect happiness!

444
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,758
How San Francesco left Santa Maria
degli Angeli with his brothers

445
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,037
and went through the world
to preach peace.

446
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,598
They're coming!

447
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,954
We found few people to accept our alms;
they say we're poor.

448
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:36,639
We leave our garden in your hands.

449
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,591
We leave you everything: Oil, bread,
nuts. Not much, but all yours.

450
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,318
Please care for our chapel,
because we are going away to preach.

451
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,714
I can't come, not with this cloak.

452
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:38,632
True, apostles have no cloaks or shoes.
You've more than you need, give them away.

453
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,317
Happy? You need a cowl.

454
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:47,471
God bless you! I take only my faith
with me, I leave you my heart.

455
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,868
Farewell, brother Nightingale.
Farewell, shady brother Tree.

456
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:58,438
Farewell, blessed earth.
Farewell, little house.

457
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,759
Farewell, Santa Maria degli Angeli.

458
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:41,075
Some for us, some we
give to the poor.

459
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,795
Take everything. Even my stick.

460
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,831
Come here, Father.

461
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,471
Bring the gifts.

462
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,072
The Lord bless you.

463
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,434
Brothers, I have nothing left.

464
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,239
Nor have I, and I have
fifteen children.

465
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,030
We've given everything,
now let us thank God.

466
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,069
Father Silvestro, you're a Priest,
say the blessing.

467
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,078
O my Lord, my hope is in You.

468
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:18,797
Send us help from on high!

469
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,999
Show us Your paths.

470
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:27,313
Teach us Your way.

471
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,912
Guide our steps.

472
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,677
Giovanni, we're waiting for you.

473
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,678
The time has come for us to separate

474
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,356
for each to go and preach alone.

475
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,950
Father, which way do we go?
- God will show us.

476
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,430
How shall we know God's will?

477
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,876
I command you to spin around,
like children playing,

478
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:05,558
until your head is dizzy.

479
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,269
Not dizzy yet?

480
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,559
Still not dizzy?

481
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,389
Now I'm dizzy!

482
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,551
Ah, my head's spinning!

483
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,914
In which direction did you fall?

484
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,957
Towards Siena.

485
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,471
Towards Florence.

486
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,109
Towards Arezzo.

487
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,273
Towards Pisa.

488
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,759
Towards Spoleto.

489
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,794
Towards Foligno.

490
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,950
Where did you fall, Giovanni?

491
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,913
Towards that finch dancing on the trees.

492
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,718
Then follow that bird, and the
road the Lord has shown you.

493
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:53,591
So, my sons, spread throughout the
world and preach peace. Farewell.
