<i>Praise be to you, O Lord,

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,552
<i>Especially Brother Sun,</i>

<i>through whom you light our days.</i>

16

<i>He is beautiful and radiant

17

<i>and derives all meaning from you.</i>

THE FLOWERS OF ST. FRANCIS

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,348
<i>Praise be to you, O Lord,
for Sister Moon and all the stars,</i>

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,351
<i>which you cause to shine
clear and bright.</i>

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,638
<i>Praise be to you, O Lord,
for Brother Wind,</i>

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,197
<i>and for cloudy and clear skies,
and all kinds of weather,</i>

<i>which bring sustenance
to all your creatures.</i>

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,918
<i>Praise be to you, O Lord,
for Sister Water,</i>

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,590
<i>so useful and humble,
precious and chaste.</i>

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,270
<i>Praise be to you, O Lord,
for Brother Fire,</i>

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,311
<i>with whom you light up the night</i>

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,478
<i>and who is beautiful and playful,
robust and strong.</i>

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,000
<i>Praise be to you, O Lord,
for Sister and Mother Earth,</i>

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,390
<i>who sustains, governs
and brings forth the various fruits</i>

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,910
<i>with their colorful flowers
and leaves.</i>

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,520
<i>Praise be to you, O Lord, for those
who forgive out of love for you,</i>

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,080
<i>and who withstand infirmity
and tribulation.</i>

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,834
<i>Blessed are those who live in peace,</i>

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,278
<i>for they will be crowned by you,
the Most High.</i>

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,473
<i>Praise be to you, O Lord,
for our Sister Bodily Death,</i>

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,554
<i>from whom no mortal man
can escape.</i>

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,196
<i>Woe to those who die in mortal sin.</i>

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,639
<i>Blessed are those who abide
by your holy will,</i>

40
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,558
<i>for death shall not harm them.</i>

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,919
<i>Praise and bless my Lord.</i>

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,071
<i>Give thanks and serve him humbly.</i>

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
"God chose the foolish things
of this world to humiliate the learned,

44
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,712
the weak to humiliate the strong."
St. Paul

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,352
<i>So Francis, to vanquish the world,</i>

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,680
<i>made himself contemptible
and humble.</i>

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,990
<i>He became a child in order
to be worthy of the kingdom of heaven.</i>

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,795
<i>The world laughed at him
and called him mad,</i>

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,840
<i>but Pope Innocent had faith in him</i>

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,308
<i>and gave him permission
to bring among men</i>

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,790
<i>his faith in meekness and poverty.</i>

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,478
<i>Here is Francis, returning to Rivotorto
from Rome with his companions.</i>

53
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,875
<i>Their hut is occupied, so they retire
to St. Mary of the Angels,</i>

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,152
<i>whence they will spread
the power of their meekness</i>

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,789
<i>and their sweet love of peace.</i>

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,793
If I were to preach to the people,
I would begin thus:

57
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,670
"I've come among you to tell you
a secret that will make you rejoice.

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,639
I will teach you what you must do
to find true peace."

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,713
- Joy.
- Exactly.

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,400
Because joy, like true peace, begets
ardent desire in the human heart.

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
If I were to preach,

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
I'd speak to men of glory.

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,196
Did he not say we must find in ourselves
the spirit of the perfect knight?

64
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,313
He was referring to the ardent love

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,193
with which we should preach
God's word.

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
My brother, ardor springs from a heart

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,830
steeped in the joy
of which Brother Ruffino just spoke.

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,078
I say all Christians
should aspire to do battle.

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,029
Especially when the battle is followed
by possession of the desired object.

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,116
You mean the battle for virtue?

71
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,274
The joy I referred to
is that felt by the soul

72
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,959
when it tames
the passions that tormented it.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,549
Don't you remember?
We lived in a state of perfect calm.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,280
In those clear, starry nights,

75
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,919
dreams enchanted our youth.

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
But his conversion broke that spell
that could have been our ruin.

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,389
Now, with the blessing
of his Holiness the Pope,

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,990
we should spread the knowledge
of this new divine reality.

79
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,557
The joy which we possess today,
Brother Pietro,

80
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,753
is the result of this struggle
divine goodness has inspired within us.

81
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,798
Brother Bernardo, why do you not
explain in your own sweet way

82
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,200
how creatures are to attain

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,111
such peace of the spirit?

84
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,948
Would you follow Christ in poverty
and humility as he has done?

85
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,588
- Welcome, joy!
- O comforting glory!

86
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,760
May all find sweetness
in the struggle for it!

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,194
May all men rediscover love's joy!

88
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,192
- Careful, brother. Are you thirsty?
- Help him.

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,588
But why you? Why you, I say!

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,871
Why you?
- What do you mean?

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,000
Why, Francis,
does the world follow you?

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,310
Every man wants to see you,
hear you, obey you.

93
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,636
You are neither handsome,
nor great, nor noble.

94
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,550
Because God found
no more humble creature on earth.

95
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,118
Because he saw among sinners
no one more vile than me.

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,514
So that men would see that every
virtue and good comes from Him.

97
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,358
Glory be to God forever.

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,478
And that's why
I follow you too, Francis.

99
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,797
- Go in.
- We can't.

100
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,751
Our hut is occupied.

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,280
Come, a little chivalry won't hurt you.

102
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,474
Good evening.

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,310
- What do you want?
- Brother, we must rest a while.

104
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,548
Bring the donkey back in here.
I'll give you rest!

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,160
But we built this hut
with our own hands.

106
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
- Well, I need it now!
- We'll make room as best we can.

107
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,349
Get out!

108
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,200
- But that's not charitable.
- Nor civil.

109
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,988
Out, out!
Enough yammering!

110
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,960
I'll show you,
if you keep bothering me.

111
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,191
Out, vile thieves!

112
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,793
I'm talking to you! Move!

113
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,435
Matteo, Bernardo, Leone,

114
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,516
lambs of the good Lord, come.

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,593
- Where will we go now?
- I know where to go.

116
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,634
- What will we do?
- It's cold!

117
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,990
Don't you see that our hearts
have reason to rejoice?

118
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,676
It's the first time providence
has made us useful to others.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,798
Father, what's upsetting you?

120
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,232
May God forgive me for taking
advantage of your obedience.

121
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,436
Bernardo, come here.

122
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,790
I command you to do what I ask
in holy obedience.

123
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,471
I'm prepared to obey,
if you promise to do what I ask of you.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,549
- I'll do as you wish.
- Tell me, Father, what you wish.

125
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,589
I command you
to punish me for my arrogance.

126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,591
As I lay flat on the ground,

127
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,756
place one foot on my mouth
and the other on my neck,

128
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,000
and moving your weight
back and forth three times, repeat,

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,912
"Lie there, wretch,
son of Pietro Bernardone.

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,998
Whence this arrogance
that imposes on your companions

131
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,076
such severe penance?"

132
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,200
The joy you see on our faces

133
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,033
is the most beautiful answer
God can give you.

134
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,278
Now we are truly beginning
to love our vocation.

135
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,070
We truly understand that
in following you, we follow God.

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,919
Thank you, my children.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,719
The Lord is always good to me.

138
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,230
How Brother Ginepro returned naked
to St. Mary of the Angels,

139
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,157
where the brothers had finished
building their hut.

140
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,120
I can't wait to go preach.

141
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,112
Brother, this work brings you
ever closer to God.

142
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,276
Perform the most humble tasks
with your own hands,

143
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,833
and you'll know life to the fullest.

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,391
Put your heart into each stone,
and each stone will make you greater.

145
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,032
Who gave you such a wonderful gift?

146
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,520
- What shall we do with those bells?
- Now we need a flock of sheep.

147
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,476
How beautiful!

148
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,112
Who gave that to you?

149
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,118
- A benefactor.
- Let's put it on the altar.

150
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,758
Finally we have bells
to call us to prayer.

151
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,076
Yet another wonderful
surprise awaits you.

152
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,238
We've finished our little house.
Do you want to see it?

153
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,031
It's so beautiful!

154
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,473
Come, children.

155
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,198
- It's lovely.
- How will we all fit?

156
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,113
- It's too small.
- We'll manage.

157
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,160
Brother Ginepro,
what happened to you?

158
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,151
The poor thing's shivering.

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,958
- Quick, cover him up.
- Get a blanket.

160
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,880
This one too.

161
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,108
What happened?

162
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,560
I gave my tunic to a poor man
asking for alms.

163
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,471
You mustn't give away your tunic.

164
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,558
Didn't you say
we must help the poor?

165
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,314
I command you not to give away
your tunic without my permission.

166
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,717
How Giovanni, known as "the simpleton,"
asked to follow Francis

167
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,551
and began imitating him
in word and gesture.

168
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,511
Leone.

169
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,397
I'm coming.

170
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,231
Francis, we're leaving.

171
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,073
Yes, go.

172
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,592
My Father,

173
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,549
help me to form,
with the help of my children,

174
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,671
a new and humble people.

175
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,192
May this new age resemble that which
witnessed your son's humility on earth.

176
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,869
May mankind live in peace.

177
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,600
In the name of the Lord,
go forth in humility and honesty,

178
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,559
praying to God in your hearts,
avoiding all vain speech and action.

179
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,109
Let each help the other.

180
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,475
If on the road you meet someone
who needs you, set aside all else,

181
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,840
for he who will not bring
peace on earth to his fellow man

182
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,832
can hope for little reward from God.

183
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,191
Brothers, beware of wasting
the precious gift of time,

184
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,392
nor should any of you appear idle
in your brothers' eyes.

185
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,759
I want my brothers to work honestly.

186
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,950
Let none be a burden to the others.

187
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,834
May he who is ignorant of the gospel
learn from your example.

188
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,600
Brothers, Ginepro cannot go
with you clad as he is.

189
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,591
He'll prepare a nice meal for you.

190
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,035
I will obey.

191
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,873
And we shall bring him
a nice tunic of silk from Provence.

192
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,040
Good-bye, brothers.
Until tonight.

193
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,272
- We shall bring back joy.
- And greetings from the poor.

194
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,629
O Lord, make me
an instrument of your peace.

195
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,669
Where there is hatred,
let me bring love.

196
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,269
Where there is discord,
let me bring harmony.

197
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,920
Where there is pain, let me bring joy,
and where there is despair, hope.

198
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,438
O Master, grant that I may not
so much seek to be loved as to love,

199
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,514
and may all on earth learn
the secret of your peace,

200
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,989
which is the fruit of justice
and brotherly love.

201
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,238
Sing a bit more softly.

202
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,200
Our Father who art in heaven,

203
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,713
hallowed be thy name.

204
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,270
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done ！

205
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,194
My little brothers,
you can praise God so easily

206
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,916
because you're free to fly
through the air so pure.

207
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,835
Now allow me some peace
in which to sing his praises.

208
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,713
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

209
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,800
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses

210
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,189
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

211
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,194
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

212
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,837
There's nobody here!

213
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,996
What do you want, brother?

214
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,994
How beautiful you are!

215
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,952
What do you want?

216
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,873
- I want to speak to the leader.
- Speak to me. It's the same thing.

217
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,632
I want to stay with Francis.

218
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,955
What will you do with this ox?

219
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,120
I'll give it to the brothers.

220
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,712
Well...

221
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,840
Grandpa's gone mad!

222
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,800
- He's gone senile.
- That's our cow.

223
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,870
We can't give it away.

224
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,080
Yes, keep the cow.
We don't need it.

225
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,071
I'll look after him. Go.

226
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,191
You can keep the old man!

227
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,158
- Here we're close to Jesus Christ.
- Jesus Christ.

228
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
- And the Virgin Mary.
- The Virgin Mary.

229
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,157
- Do you know how to pray?
- Yes. "Hail Mary..."

230
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,788
See how beautiful it is.
Do you like it?

231
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,192
We'll always come here to pray.
- To pray, always.

232
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,310
- Do you like them?
- They're beautiful.

233
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,358
The flame went out.
We'll light it tomorrow.

234
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,353
What are you doing?

235
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,232
Oil is beautiful.

236
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,033
Let us pray.

237
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,111
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

238
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,600
- Listen to the wonderful quiet.
- Wonderful quiet.

239
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,830
And this is the hut where we'll sleep.

240
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,872
It's very nice.
- Nice.

241
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,192
The fire's going out. Ginepro!

242
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
The fire.

243
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,909
The fire's so beautiful!

244
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,471
What's going on?

245
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,756
What are you doing?

246
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,836
Why were you stingy with Brother Fire?

247
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,357
I love him because he's beautiful
and playful, robust and strong.

248
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,435
God be praised for Brother Sun in the day
and Brother Fire at night.

249
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,915
But fire can also do harm.

250
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,390
And why do you want
to harm Brother Fire?

251
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,829
<i>- Father, allow me.
- No, let go.</i>

252
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
Why aren't the others back yet?

253
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,117
- I don't know, but they'll return.
- They'll return.

254
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,596
- I want to be like Francis.
- But you have a wife and children.

255
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,800
Why did you leave them?
Did they harm you?

256
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,189
No, I want to be like Francis.

257
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,800
But with us you'll have
to work even harder.

258
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,917
- I want to work.
- Your family will be as if dead to you.

259
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,880
You'll have to preach
and work among the poor.

260
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,836
Preach, work. Everything.

261
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,200
Wasn't it hard for you
to leave your loved ones?

262
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,078
- Everything.
- What do you want from Francis?

263
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,798
- I want to be a saint like Francis.
- But I'm Francis.

264
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,118
- Here they come!
- Let's go.

265
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,314
This is how those who will be
your brothers return after a day's work.

266
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,833
- Who's this dear old man?
- Our new brother.

267
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,040
What bounty from our Lord!

268
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,871
Here, Ginepro.

269
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,593
Sister Clare gave us this tunic
for Brother Ginepro.

270
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,680
She hasn't seen you in a long time
and wishes to dine with you.

271
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,671
Will you accommodate her?

272
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,671
- Do you think I should?
- Yes, we do.

273
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,280
Then tell Sister Clare
that we await her here.

274
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,477
Here, Ginepro. God does not abandon
those who serve him.

275
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,798
Why so sad?
- We are terrible sinners.

276
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,071
The Lord didn't grant us
the consolation of receiving alms.

277
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,840
Never fear. Those who do their duty
shall want for nothing.

278
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,274
What our brothers brought
belongs to us all.

279
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,949
We have a new brother.
- What's his name?

280
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,111
Giovanni's his name.

281
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,072
Of the wonderful meeting
between St. Clare and St. Francis

282
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,514
at St. Mary of the Angels.

283
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,754
- What will we do?
- Don't worry. There's still time.

284
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,838
Don't break the branches.
Just pick the flowers.

285
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,598
- Want to get on my shoulders?
- If you'll hold me.

286
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,553
How great is the Lord.

287
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,433
And we thought we had nothing
to offer Sister Clare.

288
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,471
Pick lots of them.

289
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,668
- Shall I help you?
- Yes, Father.

290
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,078
Quick, let's make
a nice carpet of flowers.

291
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,715
Smell their wonderful perfume.

292
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,353
Good children,

293
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,519
let us make our house
worthy of a maiden devoted to God.

294
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,591
Now hurry and shave.

295
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,998
Take the basins.
- Right away.

296
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,629
- Aren't you going?
- I don't need to, Father.

297
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,469
- My turn.
- Let's clean you up nice.

298
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,835
You're hurting me.

299
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,198
Gently.

300
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,552
That hurts. Gently.

301
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,639
She's coming.

302
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,712
Am I doing all right?

303
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,517
- Sister Clare is coming.
- She is? Really?

304
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,870
Sister Clare is coming!

305
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,000
Sister Clare is coming.

306
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,839
Sister Clare!

307
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,432
There she is.

308
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,149
Good day, Sister Clare.

309
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,633
Come.

310
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,478
So many memories.

311
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,913
This is the chapel in which
Sister Clare devoted herself to God.

312
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,234
Beautiful Sister Clare.

313
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,990
Hail Holy Queen,
Mary, mother of God.

314
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,438
You were chosen to be a virgin
by our heavenly Father,

315
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,036
who consecrated you
with his beloved son and Holy Spirit.

316
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,430
In you every grace and virtue
finds its fullness.

317
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,596
Hail to her tabernacle,
hail to her vestment.

318
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,240
Hail, daughter and handmaid
of our heavenly Father,

319
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,357
mother of our beloved Lord Jesus Christ,
and spouse of the Holy Spirit.

320
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,351
- He took my cape!
- Be quiet.

321
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,711
Be quiet! Brother Ginepro is naked.

322
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,669
But he took my cape!

323
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,796
...for St. Michael the Archangel
and all the saints,

324
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,877
his beloved Lord, Jesus Christ,

325
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,515
who abides with the Father
and reigns forever. Amen.

326
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,633
My cape!

327
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,032
What have you done?

328
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,197
Didn't Francis command you
not to give away your tunic?

329
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,716
Yes, but today I met
a poor man who asked for alms.

330
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,228
I had some ricotta,
but I couldn't give that to him.

331
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,080
So I said, " I have nothing
to give you but my tunic.

332
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,119
But my Father has ordered me
not to give it to anyone.

333
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,796
But if you took it off my back,
I wouldn't resist."

334
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,913
Let's go.

335
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,112
My cape!

336
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,875
Have pity! You saw he was naked.
They covered him up.

337
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,031
My blessings!

338
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,791
Take it to a poor brother.

339
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,431
No, you take it.

340
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,913
Let's go.

341
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,712
Last night

342
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,629
I was visited
once again by the devil.

343
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,954
But he left empty-handed,

344
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,277
because I have a very simple means
of driving him away.

345
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,519
When I feel him drawing near
to enter inside me,

346
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,320
I immediately shut
the door to my heart

347
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,200
and seek shelter
in holy contemplation.

348
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,034
When he knocks on the door,
I call out from inside,

349
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,158
"Stay out, evil one.

350
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,471
This inn is occupied
and there's no more room."

351
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,756
So the devil, defeated, leaves not only me
but all the area around me.

352
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,560
- My God.
- God.

353
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,872
<i>And the people of Assisi
saw a fiery red horizon.</i>

354
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,432
<i>They ran to St. Mary of the Angels,
thinking there was a fire.</i>

355
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,073
<i>The sky had been set ablaze
by the words of Clare and Francis</i>

356
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,230
<i>inflamed with the love of God.</i>

357
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,995
How Brother Ginepro
cut off a pig's foot

358
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,676
to give to a sick brother.

359
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,916
I always have to stay home.

360
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,553
That's all right.

361
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,033
Today we also have Brother Amarsebello
here, weak from fasting.

362
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,560
I made him this soup.
- Soup?

363
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,480
- It will do him good.
- Good!

364
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,789
Taste it.
Don't you think it smells good?

365
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,313
I doubt he'll be able to eat it,
but I'll take it to him anyway.

366
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,594
Brother, I've made you something
fit to revive the dead.

367
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,471
Thank you, Brother.

368
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,988
I understand, but in your condition
you shouldn't fast.

369
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,320
If our Father Francis were here,

370
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,550
he'd order you to eat it
out of holy obedience.

371
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,474
It's not for self-mortification
that I refrain from eating.

372
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,600
That's not true.
We all know you're always fasting.

373
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,795
I know what would do you good.

374
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,990
A nice boiled leg of chicken,

375
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,240
or a river trout
with some roasted sausages,

376
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,118
a fresh egg and some ricotta.

377
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,000
Then what do you want?
What can I get you?

378
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,840
A pig's foot would be
of enormous comfort.

379
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,354
You'll have it in no time.

380
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,271
He wouldn't eat it,

381
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,118
but he expressed
a desire for pigs' feet.

382
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,520
Can you find some?

383
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,149
If only God would help me find
a pig who'd offer his foot.

384
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,395
- You'll find one.
- Give me the knife.

385
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,713
- It will be as God wishes.
- Let us hope in God.

386
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,400
Brother pigs,
the Lord has placed you on my path

387
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,594
to help me.

388
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,917
Listen to me.

389
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,429
Brother Pig, listen to me, please.

390
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,880
Most handsome pig,
with your succulent foot

391
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,480
would you grant
my sick brother's wish?

392
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,040
I promise I won't hurt you.

393
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,799
The Lord will help us in need.

394
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,553
Think, brother, of the
few opportunities we have to do good.

395
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,072
Thank you, Lord, for the good that
that pig and I will do with this foot.

396
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,198
- I got one!
- You got one!

397
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,436
- Listen. He's thanking the Lord too.
- Thanking the Lord.

398
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,958
Amarsebello, I got a pig's foot.

399
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,191
- What is it, Brother Ginepro?
- Nothing.

400
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,999
What a wonderful smell!

401
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,520
<i>Thieves!</i>

402
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,714
Criminals!

403
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,433
You cut off my pig's foot!

404
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,715
You call this doing good?

405
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,000
Calm down, brother.
What happened?

406
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,760
One of your friars
cut off my pig's foot.

407
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,796
I'm sorry, but did you see him do it?

408
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,155
If I had, I'd have
cracked his head open!

409
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,717
I know who it was.
You're up to your tricks again.

410
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,320
And you call yourself a simple friar!

411
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,280
I did a good deed.

412
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,158
Ginepro, why did you commit
such a scandalous act?

413
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,629
No, Father, Brother Pig and I
have done a good deed.

414
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,476
The pig was happy too.
Isn't that true, Giovanni?

415
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,272
I command you to run after that man
and beg his forgiveness.

416
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,468
Promise to make it up to him
so he'll have no more quarrel with us.

417
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,398
I'm on my way.

418
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,515
And don't be stingy
with your penance.

419
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,636
We'll need a lot of hair, won't we?

420
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,153
That would be nice.
All for God.

421
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,591
Listen to me.

422
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,389
You too, Brother Swineherd,
can rejoice with Brother Pig...

423
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,400
because he granted
my sick brother's wish.

424
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,914
Rejoice! Please listen.

425
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,031
We helped a sick brother.

426
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,917
Aren't you glad?

427
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,069
Here, you vagrants. Eat!

428
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,640
Just don't let me see you again
or I'll break your skulls open!

429
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,835
I'll break your skull open!

430
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,558
He threw Brother Pig on the ground!

431
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,000
- I told you I appeased him.
- O merciful God!

432
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,991
He threw Brother Pig on the ground!

433
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,917
- What shall we do with it?
- We could give it to the poor.

434
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,716
It's the right thing to do.
- I'll take care of it right away.

435
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,511
How Francis,
praying one night in the woods,

436
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,560
met the leper.

437
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,716
My Lord and my all.

438
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,479
My God...

439
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
nailed on the cross.

440
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,110
To love you in the company
of my brothers.

441
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,798
Nailed on the cross.

442
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,593
My God.

443
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,510
My God!

444
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,280
My Lord and my all!

445
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,310
O great God.

446
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,471
How Brother Ginepro
cooked enough food for two weeks,

447
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:14,676
and Francis, moved by his zeal,
gave him permission to preach.

448
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,436
I have an idea.

449
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,436
Now that we have all this food,

450
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,671
shall we cook it all at once?

451
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,791
That way it'll last two weeks.

452
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,956
Or even more.
- More.

453
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,832
Then we can go preach too.

454
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,751
Wouldn't you like that?
- Sure.

455
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,880
- I hope Francis will be glad too.
- Of course.

456
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,950
- And the poor.
- Sure.

457
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,635
Where will we find a pot
big enough for all this?

458
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,671
Ask the shepherds.

459
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,640
- Good idea.
- They'll have one.

460
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,029
I'll find one there with God's help.

461
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,156
May it be to Francis's honor.

462
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,949
Get lots of greens.

463
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,271
Lots of greens.

464
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,320
What are you doing? Not that!

465
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,311
Get more wood.

466
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,479
- What are you doing?
- The wood.

467
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,552
Another one.

468
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,160
No, the rest of the greens!

469
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,468
The greens!

470
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,634
Ginepro!

471
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,157
Come quick!
The fire's going out!

472
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,029
Hurry!

473
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,190
Come quickly!
The fire's going out.

474
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,315
Ginepro's making broth tonight.

475
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,432
Don't let it go out!
We have to make the broth!

476
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,795
What are you doing?
- I don't want the fire to go out.

477
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,794
Don't put so much wood on the fire!
You'll ruin everything!

478
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,830
- I'm going crazy!
- No, that's enough!

479
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,996
- I'm going crazy!
- That's enough!

480
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,560
Don't put that on.
- Why not?

481
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,835
What are you doing?

482
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,316
Beautiful Francis!

483
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,875
What's going on?

484
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,480
I'm cooking two weeks' worth of food.
Then we can all go preach.

485
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,515
My God!

486
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,200
This soup will be good for the brain.

487
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,634
There are hens in it
that will make our bodies humble.

488
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,639
Free of cares for dinner and supper,
we can all go preach.

489
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,351
Ginepro, come here.

490
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,350
I grant you permission
to go and preach.

491
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,438
But you must begin
each sermon with these words:

492
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,438
"I talk and talk
yet accomplish little."

493
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,236
It's better to preach by example
than by words.

494
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,712
How Brother Ginepro
was judged on the gallows,

495
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,234
and how his humility vanquished
the ferocity of the tyrant Nicolaio.

496
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,751
- Get off, little girl.
- I don't want to.

497
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,797
Get on the other end.

498
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,440
Where did you get that thing?
- Nicolaio's soldiers left it.

499
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,670
- Who's he?
- The tyrant laying siege to Viterbo.

500
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,400
- Since when?
- Three months ago.

501
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,913
- Are they still there?
- Yes.

502
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,629
This is a good chance.
I'll go there right away.

503
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,111
Little girl, come here.

504
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,911
Good-bye. Have fun.

505
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,751
You wanna bet he's going
to win again?

506
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,400
No, his nose may bleed easily,

507
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,038
but he's not as full-blooded as I am.

508
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,558
I bet he can't fill the cup.

509
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,511
I say he can!

510
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,632
I say he can't!

511
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,633
I talk and talk,
yet accomplish little.

512
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,871
My God, I thank you,

513
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,914
because I finally understand
that it's not by words but by example

514
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,996
that souls are won.

515
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,460
- What's going on?
- They're playing around.

516
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,849
Something must have happened.

517
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,736
Let's go and see.

518
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,054
- What's going on over there?
- What's happening?

519
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,420
They're playing with a beggar.

520
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,773
Bring him here!

521
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,692
Go and get him.

522
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,378
Silence!

523
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,695
Search him.

524
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,060
- An awl and a flint.
- Very well.

525
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,051
Club him over the head

526
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,653
and kill him.

527
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,290
Enough! Let me try.

528
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,448
What have you done
with this damn armor?

529
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,780
It's wearing out my neck!

530
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,931
Bastards, take this off!

531
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,569
Let me do it.

532
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,140
No! With your poor aim, you nearly
chopped off the last one's rump!

533
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,290
<i>- I'll show you.
- Wait.</i>

534
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,413
Would you kill him without even
calling one of their priests?

535
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,860
That's right. Let's call one.

536
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,339
- Who will go?
- I will.

537
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,700
Call the man who follows behind us
and buries the dead.

538
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,010
Why bother with a priest?
He has to die anyway.

539
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,693
Give him some wine instead,

540
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,537
or play some music ！
he'll die quite nicely either way.

541
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,180
Cute little mouse!

542
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,978
So small, yet so intent
on killing our master.

543
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,778
Leave us.

544
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,579
My son,

545
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,819
I've come to offer
the consolation of our faith.

546
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:03,177
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

547
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,880
Tell me:

548
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,154
Who are you?

549
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,994
A sinner.

550
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,960
What sins do you have to confess?

551
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,599
Very many.

552
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,440
- Where are you from?
- Assisi.

553
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,231
- What is your name?
- Ginepro. Why?

554
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,680
The same Ginepro

555
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,638
who is a companion to Francis,
who is as kind as a mother?

556
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,751
And meek as a lamb.

557
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,156
Listen to me, by God!

558
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,634
I know this man.
He is a friend to all.

559
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,871
I'm going to speak to Nicolaio.

560
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,031
O lord! O lord!

561
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,475
O Nicolaio!

562
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,876
You're making a serious mistake.
You're killing an innocent man.

563
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,112
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

564
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,668
Nibbio, pull up my face plate.

565
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,234
Open this thing!

566
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,273
What innocent man?

567
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,480
The man you just condemned.

568
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,360
That slug meant to kill me.

569
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,920
Nibbio, show him the weapons.

570
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,040
No, these are work tools.

571
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,200
With this he lights the fire,

572
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,270
and the awl is for fixing his sandals.

573
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,675
I got word a killer would come
from Viterbo in beggar's clothing,

574
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,269
and that I would
know him by those tools.

575
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,471
This is a diabolical conspiracy.

576
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,954
I know him.

577
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,949
He's a disciple of a poor man,
a friend of the church.

578
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,111
Francis, the son of a rich man.

579
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,116
He gave everything to the poor
and lives in the woods with his friends,

580
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,671
as free as a bird.

581
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,673
His followers are many,
because he loves the humble.

582
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,120
He who despises the world
has a heart full of hatred.

583
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,480
Ergo, he's a venomous being.

584
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,600
I deny your assertion
and make a distinction.

585
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,592
Aristotle also says, does he not,

586
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,909
that he who despises the world
protects himself from pain, ergo ！

587
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,240
I know the world too,

588
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,470
and this is how the poor are.

589
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,319
They preach poverty
only to steal and kill.

590
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,072
I've also heard that
they refuse everything,

591
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,360
and that they're incapable
of harming anyone.

592
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,318
Ergo, bring him back here.

593
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,511
I want to question him myself!

594
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,832
Get back, the rest of you.

595
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,671
Tell me, who are you?

596
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,394
A terrible sinner.

597
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,673
Take my helmet off.

598
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,956
Nibbio, where are you?

599
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,958
Hurry up!

600
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,512
Quick!

601
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,559
Is it true

602
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,558
you would betray us
to the men of Viterbo?

603
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,710
I am a terrible traitor
and unworthy of all favor.

604
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,713
But did you want to kill me, Nicolaio,
with that flint,

605
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,120
and then set fire to the camp?

606
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,269
Me?

607
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,838
I was just ！

608
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,671
I'm a terrible sinner.

609
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,920
I'd do far worse
than those things you say

610
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,911
if God weren't watching over me.

611
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,234
If this is Ginepro, imagine Francis.

612
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,680
See what truth there is in his words.

613
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:16,319
Before God we are always more guilty
than men could ever say.

614
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,554
First of all, because we're not
grateful to God in the slightest.

615
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,954
Secondly, because we have little
or no love for our neighbor.

616
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,440
And we would be
even more vile and guilty

617
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,910
if God in his mercy didn't assist us.

618
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,280
- I don't understand these words.
- Nor do I!

619
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,477
Get this armor off me, now!

620
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,239
Quick!

621
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,840
- But, Nicolaio ！
- Get out of here.

622
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,673
Take him to my tent.
Not you!

623
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,475
Hurry!

624
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,032
Go away.

625
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,470
Sound the rally!

626
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,595
We're lifting the siege!

627
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,831
How Brother Francis
and Brother Leone

628
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:43,405
experienced those things
that are perfect happiness.

629
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:55,728
Leone, my brother, lamb of our Lord,

630
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:58,200
even were we able
to restore sight to the blind,

631
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,326
straighten the limbs of the crippled,
banish all demons,

632
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,406
restore hearing to the deaf
and speech to the mute,

633
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:04,967
and bring the dead back to life,

634
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:07,240
that would not be perfect happiness.

635
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,920
<i>Thief! Thief!</i>

636
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:13,607
Murderer!

637
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,250
- He's dead.
- Did you see that, Brother?

638
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:28,560
He wanted my gold,
but I punished him severely.

639
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,647
Brother, what have you done?

640
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,610
Is a bit of gold worth a man's life?

641
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:40,521
Take this offering.

642
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,805
May he rest in peace.

643
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:31,958
Brother Leone,
lamb of our good Lord,

644
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,890
even were we able to speak
the language of the angels

645
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:36,881
and know the secrets of the heart,

646
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,764
even that would not
constitute perfect happiness.

647
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:45,004
O Leone, even were we able
to predict the future

648
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,086
and know nature's secrets,

649
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,724
even that would not be
perfect happiness.

650
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:56,530
O Brother Leone, even were we to convert
the infidels to the faith of Christ,

651
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,407
it would not
bring us perfect happiness.

652
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,362
Please, Brother, where does
perfect happiness reside?

653
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:03,763
Look, a house.

654
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:07,480
Let us go and see if people there
wish to praise Jesus with us.

655
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:12,849
God in his mercy will show us
where perfect happiness lies.

656
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:41,849
<i>Who is it?</i>

657
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,926
Would you give us alms, brother?

658
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,848
We're poor friars who wander
for the love of people's souls.

659
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:00,326
Hear us, brother.
We'll show you how to serve Jesus Christ.

660
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:02,441
Serve Jesus Christ with us.

661
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,566
Serve Jesus Christ with us.

662
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,364
Why won't you serve
Jesus Christ with us?

663
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:15,208
I told you scoundrels to get out of here.
Stop bothering people!

664
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:23,841
Brother, give us alms.

665
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,605
Serve Jesus Christ with us.

666
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,801
I'll show you how I serve Jesus Christ!

667
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,730
Get out of here!
Thieves! Lazy bums!

668
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:35,528
Swindlers! Out!

669
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,283
Take that! Get out!

670
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,721
I'll take care of you! Get out!

671
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,360
Get out!

672
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:48,446
Be gone, you knaves, scoundrels,
good-for-nothings!

673
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:53,081
- We just asked for charity.
- I'll show you charity with my club!

674
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:58,199
I'll beat you as hard as I can,
one knot at a time.

675
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:01,128
You'll feel every knot in my club.

676
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:06,242
Take that! And that!

677
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:11,002
- Think of your soul.
- Think of your own soul!

678
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:15,805
And if you want more, just keep
bothering people in their homes!

679
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,000
O Brother Leone,
lamb of our good Lord,

680
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:21,886
now that we've borne all this
for the love of our blessed Christ,

681
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:24,758
know that in this resides
perfect happiness.

682
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:28,250
Because above all the gifts
Christ bestows on his servants

683
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,241
is that of triumphing over ourselves

684
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:33,248
and bearing every evil deed
and tribulation out of love for him.

685
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:36,249
In this alone lies perfect happiness.

686
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:58,242
How Saint Francis left
St. Mary of the Angels with his friars

687
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:04,281
and traveled the world
preaching peace.

688
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:10,759
<i>They're coming, Francis!</i>

689
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,321
<i>Come, Francis!</i>

690
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,644
<i>They're coming, Francis!</i>

691
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:22,280
Here they are, Francis.

692
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:24,801
They're here.

693
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:30,210
We didn't find many.
No one would accept our alms.

694
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:32,170
They say we're poor.

695
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:37,039
Come. We're leaving and want
to leave you our gardens.

696
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,162
I'm 84 years old.
In April I'll be 85.

697
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,882
Many happy returns.

698
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,286
Our little chapel is lovely, isn't it?

699
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,529
Come.

700
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:17,079
Our oil, bread and nuts.

701
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,599
These are simple things,
but we bequeath them to you.

702
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,530
But you must take care
of our little chapel,

703
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:25,442
for we're going out into the world
to preach, aren't we?

704
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:29,286
- I can't go.
- Why not?

705
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,845
I can't go with my cape.

706
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:35,890
You're right.
An apostle wears neither cape nor shoes.

707
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,881
You have more than you need.
Good for you.

708
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:40,848
Shall we give it to the poor?
- Yes, to the poor.

709
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,002
My cape and shoes to the poor.

710
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:52,323
- Happy now?
- Yes.

711
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:54,925
- He needs a hood.
- Right away.

712
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:44,929
God bless you, children,
and good-bye.

713
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:48,645
I take only my faith with me.
My heart stays here with you.

714
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,324
Good-bye, Brother Nightingale.

715
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:56,010
Good-bye, Brother Tree,
who sheltered us in your shade.

716
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,127
Good-bye, blessed earth.

717
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,207
Good-bye, Brother Birds.

718
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:17,765
- Good-bye, dear little home.
- Good-bye, St. Mary of the Angels.

719
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,326
Peace unto you, brothers.

720
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,246
Peace.

721
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:39,002
We'll give some to the poor...

722
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:43,239
and keep some for ourselves.

723
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:48,567
- Thank you, brothers.
- We'll give you what we have.

724
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:56,008
Here, take my cane as well.

725
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,610
Peace unto you.

726
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:08,530
Come, Father, come.

727
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,730
May God reward you.

728
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,039
Giovanni, bring the gifts to Father.

729
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,719
Thank you, and God bless you.

730
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:25,004
- God bless you all.
- Peace unto you.

731
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,685
Brothers, I'm left with nothing.

732
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:36,762
Me too, and I have
15 children to support!

733
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:41,369
Calm down.

734
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:44,808
Now that we've given you everything,
let us go and thank the Lord.

735
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:47,200
Keep calm, for the love of God.

736
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:02,728
Father Silvestro, you who are a priest,
bless us in God's name.

737
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:14,486
- Lord, save your servants.
- O Lord, we place our trust in you.

738
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:18,922
- Send us, O Lord, your help from above.
- Protect us from the devil.

739
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:23,407
- Be our salvation.
- Against our enemies.

740
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:27,529
- Lord, show us the way.
- And teach us your path.

741
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:32,520
- May you guide our steps.
- In the way of your commandments.

742
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:47,759
- Good-bye, Sister. God bless you.
- Peace.

743
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:20,283
We're here.

744
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:37,607
Giovanni, we're waiting for you.

745
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:39,686
Giovanni's coming.

746
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:43,648
My children, the time has come
to go our separate ways.

747
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:47,361
From now on, each will travel
and preach on his own.

748
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:51,041
- Father, which way should we go?
- The way shown by God.

749
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:54,048
And how will we know God's will?

750
01:18:55,650 --> 01:19:00,360
I command you, out of holy obedience,
to spin around where you stand,

751
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:02,330
the way children do at play,

752
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:06,118
and don't stop spinning
until you're dizzy.

753
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:31,324
Aren't you dizzy?

754
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,203
Still not dizzy?

755
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:57,403
- Are you all right?
- Now I'm dizzy.

756
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,406
Come, Giovanni.

757
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:05,123
My head's spinning!

758
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:14,844
Amarsebello, which way
were you facing when you fell?

759
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,370
Toward Siena, like me.

760
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:19,600
- And you, Bernardo?
- Toward Florence.

761
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,961
- Ginepro?
- Toward Arezzo.

762
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:24,166
- Elia?
- Toward Pisa.

763
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:26,970
- Ruffino?
- Toward Spoleto.

764
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,120
- Egidio?
- Toward Foligno.

765
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:31,806
And you, Giovanni,
which way were you facing?

766
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:36,686
That way, where that sparrow
hops among the trees.

767
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,649
Then you will follow that sparrow,

768
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:45,648
as it's surely the path
the Lord has shown you.

769
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:51,082
Now, my children, go forth
into the world and preach peace.

770
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
end
