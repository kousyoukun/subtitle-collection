1
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:36,804
Let me show you
what I made today.

2
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,176
I can't wait.

3
00:00:39,644 --> 00:00:41,304
I need to go upstairs
and change...

4
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:43,479
and then I'll start dinner.

5
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:06,704
Oh, yes, it's ladies night,
and the feel--

6
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:08,630
Showtime.

7
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:15,294
Rough day at the office,
Mrs Dunleavy?

8
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:18,515
You'll feel better once you
get out of those work clothes.

9
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:21,264
And into some sweats.

10
00:01:24,814 --> 00:01:28,479
I wish you'd let me
rub those feet.

11
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:31,351
Of course,
I wouldn't use my hands.

12
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:47,869
I think Victoria
just told me her secret.

13
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,097
Deedly dee.
Are those things for me?

14
00:02:02,894 --> 00:02:05,350
Mom, coming in.

15
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:08,305
Scottie Dunleavy?

16
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:11,017
What unfortunate timing.

17
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:15,614
Get out. Don't you know
this is naughty time?

18
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:17,237
I'll get it.

19
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:22,985
Hello, Scottie. Why don't you
be a good little boy...

20
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:26,126
go downstairs
and let your mother get comfy?

21
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,664
Who is this?

22
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,666
This is a big bird who wants
to see the rest of Mommy.

23
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,757
Oh, my God, Scottie.
Is that a man up our tree?

24
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:42,845
No, no.
Tell her it's just a big bird.

25
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:07,208
Hey, pal, welcome.

26
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:10,622
Welcome to what? Where am l?

27
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:13,460
Aren't you that horny guy who
was pretending to be a big bird?

28
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:16,047
Checking out that beautiful mom?

29
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,708
Yes, I am.

30
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:21,428
Now you'll see what a big horny
bird actually looks like...

31
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,432
in Hell!

32
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,902
I deserve this!

33
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:10,394
-Knock, knock.
-Hey, Jimmy.

34
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,098
-What are you doing, Nicky?
-Just jamming.

35
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,272
Your father wants you and your
brothers in the throne room.

36
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:18,694
He's not retiring today, is he?

37
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:20,864
He wants to talk to you
and Cassius and Adrian...

38
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:23,732
about who'll rule Hell
for the next 10,000 years.

39
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:26,776
Why do I need to go?
He won't pick me.

40
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:30,201
I happen to think
you'd make a great Devil.

41
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:33,455
I'm not into evil and torture
and all that stuff.

42
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:36,673
Plus, the Prince of Darkness
should look distinguished...

43
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:40,252
and let's face facts,
I'm no George Clooney.

44
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,677
You're not
a bad-looking guy, Nicky.

45
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:44,597
Look at that picture.

46
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:48,548
I used to talk normal, too...

47
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,269
before Cassius hit me
in the face with a shovel.

48
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:55,519
That's me now, and I accept it.

49
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:58,772
Your brothers are two of
the sickest guys I've ever seen.

50
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:01,729
For some reason, you're not.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

51
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,449
Their mothers were fire dragons
and mine was a goat.

52
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:07,074
How do I compete with that?

53
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:10,788
Your mother was not a goat.
They're just playing with you.

54
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,500
If one of those psychos
gets picked, I'm doomed.

55
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:17,002
I knew it, Adrian.
He's finally retiring.

56
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:22,672
Cassius, I've been waiting on
this day for 10,000 years.

57
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,461
If the old man picks me
to take over Hell...

58
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:31,179
I'll keep torture going 24-7.
No breaks.

59
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:32,677
Whoa, mama!

60
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:35,720
You got him right in the eye.

61
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:39,146
Hey! How's Daddy's
little girl doing today?

62
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:42,233
I didn't see you guys.
What's up?

63
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:44,738
Shovel face,
you want to mind-wrestle?

64
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,280
Nah, I'm all right.

65
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:48,571
I was thinking of chilling out
by the throne for a bit.

66
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,327
I'm going to mind-wrestle you
whether you like it or not.

67
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,246
I have to warn you,
I'm getting pretty good at it.

68
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,082
Then I guess
I can't make you do this.

69
00:05:57,546 --> 00:06:01,247
Mercy. You win.
I give. Game over.

70
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:02,998
What are you boys doing?

71
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,548
Nothing, Dad. Just hitting
the old punching bags.

72
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,097
Cassius...

73
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:14,478
didn't I tell you to stay out
of your brother's mind?

74
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,350
I forgot.

75
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:18,607
Maybe this
will help you remember.

76
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,282
Now, everybody come sit down.

77
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:28,030
-Hey, Dad.
-Yes, son?

78
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,609
I know you got a lot
on your mind...

79
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,116
but I almost finished that
Monsters of Metal compilation.

80
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,622
I really think it's turning
into a masterpiece.

81
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:37,579
OK, kid.
We'll listen to it later.

82
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:39,504
Thanks.

83
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,548
A window.

84
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:49,926
Hello, Mr Devil.
I like your cape.

85
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:00,023
I deserve this!

86
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:05,277
Fellas, this,
as some of you might know...

87
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,524
is my 10,000th year
as Prince of Darkness...

88
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:13,114
so I think the time has come
to discuss who will succeed me.

89
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:16,037
-Knock, knock.
-Yes, Jimmy?

90
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:17,580
Don't forget--

91
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:21,413
you're shoving a pineapple
up Hitler's ass at four p.m.

92
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:27,425
This was a very
difficult decision...

93
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,557
because I have
three wonderful sons.

94
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:34,764
Adrian--so smart, so ruthless.

95
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:36,259
Wears makeup.

96
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,597
And Cassius--
so strong, so tough.

97
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,894
Don't forget clinically insane.

98
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:45,021
And Nicky...

99
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,191
such a sweet boy.

100
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:54,743
But after much thought
and careful consideration...

101
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:58,373
I've decided that the ruler
for the next 10,000 years...

102
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,294
is going to have to be...

103
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:03,919
me.

104
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:05,793
-What?
-Hallelujah!

105
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,584
I mean, that sucks!

106
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,295
The important thing
for the stability of our rule...

107
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:14,172
is to maintain the balance
between good and evil...

108
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:17,976
and I don't think any of you are
ready for that responsibility.

109
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:20,347
Dad, this is bullshit!

110
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:23,733
I don't like that language.

111
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:27,520
Right. Send him in.

112
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,614
Sorry, boys.
I have to get back to work.

113
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,569
It was good
hanging with you, Dad.

114
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:33,031
I'll check you later.

115
00:08:58,478 --> 00:08:59,641
You're serious?

116
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:13,901
Off, off, off!

117
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:16,360
Damn!

118
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,823
Twenty thousand years ago,
Grandpa Lucifer said...

119
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,956
"It's better to rule in Hell
than to serve in Heaven."

120
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,504
Well, I'm tired
of serving in Hell.

121
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:30,168
We need somewhere
where we can rule.

122
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,426
Bring it on, big man.
Let's see what you got.

123
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:42,602
Could you concentrate
for five seconds?

124
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:44,393
I am concentrating, man.

125
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:45,973
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:46,443 --> 00:09:49,016
After careful consideration,
I must respectfully decline.

127
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,030
I can't stand retirement.

128
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,482
Just let me win one Super Bowl.

129
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,868
In exchange for eternal
damnation of your soul?

130
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,950
You're much too nice a guy
for that, Mr Marino.

131
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:01,791
You did it for Namath.

132
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,449
Joe was coming here anyways.

133
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,294
This sucks.

134
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:07,165
I'll go to the Super Bowl
as an announcer...

135
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:08,627
and win myself an Emmy!

136
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:09,790
That's the spirit.

137
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,966
You're a good Devil, Dad.

138
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:15,097
I also happen to be a Jets fan.

139
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:18,556
What do you think about Earth?

140
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:20,595
We could create
our own Hell there.

141
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,303
Are you saying we go up there
and kill everyone?

142
00:10:23,772 --> 00:10:24,887
Eventually, Cassius...

143
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:27,480
but first we'd have to corrupt
as many souls as we can...

144
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:30,185
so when we do destroy them...

145
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:33,026
Their damned souls will be ours.

146
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,399
It's our time, brother.

147
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,911
This is not good.

148
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:47,956
Whoa, whoa.
Fellas, what are you doing?

149
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:49,453
We're leaving.

150
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:51,086
You can't go through there!

151
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,922
The fire flows in, not out.

152
00:10:58,098 --> 00:10:59,474
You really suck!

153
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,516
Your Evilness!

154
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,687
Cassius and Adrian
have escaped from Hell.

155
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:07,975
They went out through the fire
and froze it.

156
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:11,893
I tried to stop them, sir,
but they overpowered me.

157
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:19,483
Calm down. Get off your knees.

158
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:21,946
Thank you for understanding,
Your Wickedness.

159
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:24,870
You're the man.
I've always said that.

160
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:30,743
Are there boobs on my head?

161
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:32,792
Yeah. Big ones.

162
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,966
What's going on, Dad?

163
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,420
I'm going to die, Nicky.
The gates are broken.

164
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:41,672
No new souls can get in,
so I'll start to deteriorate.

165
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:44,769
What's with all
those "hoo hoo" noises?

166
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:46,094
Everything's fine, Pop.

167
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:48,437
Everything's fine?
Who are you bullshitting?

168
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,569
Last time you said that,
the Renaissance happened.

169
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:54,269
Please, Pop,
go back to your room.

170
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:55,734
Can I take him with me?

171
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:58,440
Sure, Pop. Whatever you want.

172
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,653
Tit-head, go with my father.

173
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,376
Not a damn soul is going
to get through that.

174
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:10,378
This fire is solid as rock.

175
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:12,629
We got to get this bad boy
burning again.

176
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,086
To do that,
Cassius and Adrian...

177
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,708
have to come back through
the other way.

178
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:18,209
So go get them, Dad.

179
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,463
I'm too weak.
The process has already begun.

180
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,428
So go get them, Jimmy.

181
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,182
I'm just a demon.
No Devil blood in me.

182
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,184
I wouldn't last two minutes
with your brothers.

183
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,559
Are you saying it's up to me?

184
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,396
You said no souls
could get through that.

185
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:40,909
Nicky, are you a soul
or the spawn of Satan?

186
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,488
I never been to Earth, Dad.

187
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:46,624
I never even slept over
some other dude's house.

188
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,870
The worst thing that could
happen is you get killed.

189
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,503
In which case, boom--
you end up back here.

190
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:56,965
So I need to go to Earth
and kill my brothers?

191
00:12:57,426 --> 00:13:01,127
No go. They left together
at the exact same time.

192
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:05,132
They must come back together
at the exact same time.

193
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:07,179
Here.

194
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:09,104
Get them to drink from this.

195
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:11,022
One sip,
and they'll be trapped inside.

196
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:15,859
Once you've got both of them,
bring it back through the gate.

197
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,028
Let me, sir.

198
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:19,604
Gross!

199
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:23,866
He's got less than a week.

200
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:29,749
Dad, I don't know
if I can do this.

201
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,285
Son, you...

202
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,212
Try your best.

203
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:01,819
Earth.

204
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,983
It doesn't look too bad.

205
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,082
You were gone ten seconds.
What happened?

206
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:25,007
I got hit by this big light
attached to a lot of metal.

207
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:28,094
That's a train, son.
Don't stand in front of them.

208
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,682
I'll have to take a mulligan
on this one.

209
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:34,016
Please, Nicky,
get back up there.

210
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,348
All right.

211
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,311
I'll get that for you, sir.

212
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,117
I'm Nicky.

213
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,697
That's terrific.

214
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,085
Now get off the track
and come with me, handsome.

215
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,915
Welcome to Grand Central Station
in New York City.

216
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:03,092
My name is Beefy.

217
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:05,213
I'm an old friend
of your father's.

218
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,676
He asked me to help you out.

219
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,057
I just want to find my brothers
and be on my way.

220
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,432
It's not going to be easy.

221
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:13,223
Your brothers
can possess people...

222
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,396
so they probably
won't look like themselves.

223
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:19,641
You have to be suspicious
of everyone.

224
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:21,309
All right, bro.

225
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,030
The jig is up, then.
Get in the flask.

226
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,690
It ain't me, moron.

227
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,440
Sorry.

228
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:32,577
There's this blind guy outside
you might think is possessed...

229
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,283
but he's just crazy.

230
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,959
Though I cannot see
with these blind eyes...

231
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:41,498
I know the good Lord
still loves me.

232
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,295
He loves all of his children.

233
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,302
-Why, he loves you...
-That's him.

234
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:47,387
...and he loves you.

235
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,473
Here he goes.

236
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:53,970
You make the Lord very nervous.

237
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:55,184
All right.

238
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,307
-I'm burning now.
-Take it easy.

239
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,850
Hellfire is burning me alive!

240
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:02,607
He's burning.

241
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,028
The Beast is alive!
He's among us!

242
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,903
Clear the streets!
The Devil is here!

243
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:13,996
Making friends already.

244
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,249
I don't know
what that guy's problem was.

245
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,706
It's freezing up here.

246
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,162
You're in the human world now,
kid.

247
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,501
You'll feel a lot of new things
you never felt before.

248
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:27,799
Let's get you some warm clothes
and hot food.

249
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:40,221
Put it in your mouth.

250
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:49,945
Now move your teeth
up and down.

251
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:54,194
Up and down.

252
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:55,945
Good, numb nuts.

253
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,124
Now you got to swallow it.

254
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,412
Tilt your head back...

255
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,462
and let the meat
slide down your throat hole.

256
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,001
Easy. Don't choke.

257
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:14,423
Popeye's chicken
is fucking awesome.

258
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,553
Now eat up.
You'll need your energy.

259
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,938
I got energy up the ying-yang.
Let's save Dad.

260
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,391
Adrian! Cassius!

261
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:24,810
Oh, boy.

262
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,022
So nice.

263
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:34,408
I like your brassiere.

264
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:37,244
Thank you.

265
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,495
Could you guys maybe
not tell anyone about this?

266
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:41,957
You got it.

267
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:44,544
Do you mind maybe not telling
anybody about this?

268
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:46,418
You got it.

269
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:50,667
Look, sidewalk equals safety.

270
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,716
Middle of the road equals death.

271
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:57,974
From now on, I'll just avoid
all moving metal objects.

272
00:17:58,437 --> 00:18:01,936
Great. Now, your father
gave me some deposit money...

273
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,606
for a nice pad
on the Upper East Side...

274
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:07,227
but I misplaced it.

275
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,447
I'm wasted!

276
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:16,616
So I found
this other joint for you...

277
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:18,789
but you're going
to have a roommate.

278
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:21,657
There's only one thing better...

279
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:23,871
than drinking
an ice-cold whiskey sour...

280
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:26,544
on a hot Alabama night...

281
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,166
and that's telling the truth.

282
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:32,208
I know what you think
about me, Grandma.

283
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,471
You think I'm worthless.

284
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:36,343
You think I'm a stumblebum...

285
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,300
who ain't never going
to amount to anything.

286
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,976
Well, old woman, you are wrong.

287
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,985
You are wrong.

288
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,190
Hello, friend.
My name is Nicky.

289
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,653
I understand
you are seeking a roommate...

290
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,612
as per your ad
in the "Village Voice."

291
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:02,573
Would it be possible for me
to fill the slot?

292
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,953
Don't you want
to know what rent is?

293
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:09,420
Yes. What is rent?

294
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:11,841
It's 1,200,
split down the middle.

295
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:15,090
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I rehearse with my partner...

296
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:17,015
so the living room's
going to be off-limits.

297
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:18,589
Off-limits.

298
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,385
Aren't you boiling hot
in that outfit?

299
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:24,559
It's 80 degrees in this hallway.
Where are you from, the South?

300
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,063
The Deep South.

301
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:38,650
-Why is that funny?
-I don't know.

302
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:43,783
OK. And sorry, guy,
but no doggies allowed.

303
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,659
Go on. Big day tomorrow.

304
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:49,585
And don't forget to do that
sleep thing I told you about.

305
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:50,630
Gotcha.

306
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:53,049
You're not my brother, are you?

307
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:54,590
I'm an only child.

308
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:56,632
You love acting.

309
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:58,841
I love pissing.

310
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:37,466
Oh, my God!

311
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:53,519
In today's Gospel...

312
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:55,945
the Lord tells us
how we should live...

313
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:59,278
if we wish to attain
the splendour of Heaven.

314
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,203
Or something like that.

315
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:04,994
Jesus this, Moses that.

316
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,949
Abraham hit me
with a wiffle ball bat.

317
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:19,877
The Lord said a lot of hibbity
jibbity bibbity swibbity.

318
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,213
But...

319
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:25,934
has he ever really done
anything for any of us?

320
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:30,476
Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR
in my driveway?

321
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:31,938
No.

322
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:33,564
I love that car.

323
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:37,860
Has the Lord given
any of my enemies the herpes?

324
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:39,439
No.

325
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:44,488
The Lord gave my son
the strength to get off drugs.

326
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:47,120
Ma'am, I know your son...

327
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:50,205
and, believe me,
he was better off on the drugs.

328
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,627
At least
when he was smoking hashish...

329
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,082
he used to make me laugh
occasionally.

330
00:21:57,343 --> 00:21:58,968
After we tried for many years...

331
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:02,845
the Lord finally helped
my wife conceive a baby.

332
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:07,385
Your best friend Fitzy
helped your wife.

333
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:12,397
He helped her conceive it
all night long.

334
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:17,606
How about you, Mayor?

335
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:19,401
Has the Lord
ever done anything for you?

336
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:24,611
Well, you know, I wished
I could think of something...

337
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,037
but, to be honest with you,
I can't.

338
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,990
I can't think of a damn thing
he's ever done for me!

339
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,378
Kind of makes you wonder
if there even is a Lord...

340
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:38,584
if there is ultimate punishment
for our so-called sins.

341
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:40,546
Why don't we just have fun...

342
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:43,634
and do whatever the Hell
we want?

343
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,432
Let the sin begin!

344
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:52,847
Let the sin begin.

345
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:54,810
That was a good one.

346
00:22:55,277 --> 00:22:57,602
This is so much fun!

347
00:22:58,071 --> 00:22:59,316
I never want it to end.

348
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:02,782
Why should it end?
Who's going to stop us?

349
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,655
Come on. There's ten million
people in this city...

350
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:09,614
and the clock is ticking.

351
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,159
Let's rock and roll, then.

352
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:16,794
-Get in the flask.
-I'm not thirsty!

353
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,005
Cassius, I'll show you.

354
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,091
Cassius, get in the flask.

355
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:28,265
Get in the flask.

356
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:30,269
-May I help you?
-Get in the flask.

357
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:31,760
What are you talking about?

358
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,519
I'm talking about
an eight-piece. Let's go.

359
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:38,067
Look, it's OKfor me
to shit in the street...

360
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:41,446
but you got to use a toilet.

361
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,734
Nicky, where are you?

362
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:45,446
Aw, come on.

363
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:46,907
What's he doing now?

364
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:50,822
Just get in the flask.
I got to get Adrian.

365
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:01,130
Gary's so hairy.

366
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:03,135
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

367
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,432
All that chasing
and running around...

368
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:14,267
is making me want
to do the sleep thing again.

369
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:18,681
Kid, I like your enthusiasm,
but we have to work on...

370
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:21,145
narrowing down
our list of suspects.

371
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:26,156
I'm going to check in with
some of my contacts uptown.

372
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:37,121
Kid's got a lot of evil in him
just begging to come out.

373
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:07,615
I will eat your heart.

374
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:13,112
There's our man.

375
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:17,662
Mr Sleepyhead must have some
major ties to the dark side.

376
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,209
What's with that guy?

377
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:22,499
It's got to be one
of his disciples or something.

378
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:27,216
My man's into
deep nocturnal shit.

379
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:31,598
I think that Devil guy
just got ripped off.

380
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:34,977
-Should we wake him up?
-You do it.

381
00:25:38,524 --> 00:25:40,647
Rise and shine, Devil guy.

382
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,521
Some dude stole your shit.

383
00:25:42,987 --> 00:25:44,529
What? Where?

384
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:49,816
-Which way did he go?
-That way.

385
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:52,527
Thanks. Give me back my flask!

386
00:25:52,997 --> 00:25:54,954
Did you check out
the dragon mouth?

387
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:57,539
The Dark Prince is here.

388
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:13,923
Check out my stuff.
I got a comb only used twice.

389
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:17,643
I got a pepper shaker.
A silver doodad from Africa.

390
00:26:18,731 --> 00:26:19,680
See something you like, my man?

391
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:21,524
I would like my flask back.

392
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:22,933
You calling me a thief?

393
00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:25,146
I'm calling you
the guy who has my flask.

394
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:28,068
How would I have it
unless I was, in fact, a thief?

395
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:30,691
-I don't know.
-Now you've done it.

396
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,535
You messed
with my business, bitch.

397
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:36,198
I would appreciate it
if you kept your voice down.

398
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,702
You going all crazy-eyed on me.

399
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,878
I'll show you some crazy eye.

400
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:46,504
Look at this.
Come on, let's get busy.

401
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:48,628
-Excuse me, sir.
-Who?

402
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:51,502
Does that flask
belong to this man?

403
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:53,431
You calling me a thief, too?
Damn.

404
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:57,759
Look, the guy you ripped off
walked by and busted you...

405
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:01,396
so why don't you just give him
his flask back?

406
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:04,527
You going to bite me with
your snaggletooth if I don't?

407
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:10,111
No. But that policeman
might have something to say.

408
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,576
Take your dumb-ass canteen,
goofy.

409
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,327
Get your raggedy-ass clothes
and find another corner...

410
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,535
before I show you
what crazy really is.

411
00:27:21,002 --> 00:27:22,033
Fine. I will.

412
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:24,543
I'm a businessman.

413
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:27,129
I'll be seeing you
in a few years.

414
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:35,048
Excuse me.

415
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:38,553
That was amazing.
I just wanted to thank you.

416
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,974
That's OK.
I get messed with all the time.

417
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,773
When I saw him do that to you,
I just lost it.

418
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:47,979
I hate when people
take advantage of tourists.

419
00:27:48,446 --> 00:27:50,604
What makes you think
I'm a tourist?

420
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:53,280
Your accent, maybe.

421
00:27:53,743 --> 00:27:55,154
Well, where are you from?

422
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,363
-The South.
-Really?

423
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,373
The Deep South.

424
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:08,210
Why are we laughing?

425
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:11,960
I don't know,
but I was enjoying it.

426
00:28:12,428 --> 00:28:13,626
Your glasses are pretty.

427
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:16,635
They make your eyes
look big and sparkly.

428
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,428
It's fun looking at them.

429
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,428
My dad's an optometrist.

430
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:24,767
My dad's in Hell,
and he's falling apart.

431
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:26,561
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:28,521
It's really tough
when your folks get older.

433
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:31,656
I don't know what I would do
if I couldn't save him.

434
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:33,657
I'm sure a nice Southern boy
like you...

435
00:28:34,117 --> 00:28:35,231
will figure something out.

436
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,659
You want some Popeye's?

437
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:42,582
No. I had my lunch already.

438
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:45,498
But I wouldn't mind
getting a gelati.

439
00:28:45,962 --> 00:28:48,453
Could I come with you
to getting a gelati?

440
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:50,121
If you want to.

441
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,133
-Here you go, pal. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

442
00:28:55,597 --> 00:28:57,554
It's freezing my hands.

443
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:00,637
-Even with those gloves on?
-It's cold.

444
00:29:01,102 --> 00:29:04,518
-Let me wrap it.
-Please. Thank you.

445
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:06,808
Gelati.

446
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:09,140
Better?

447
00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:15,741
Why are you taunting me
with your darkness?

448
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:19,652
Your evil,
it's stinking up our streets!

449
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:24,748
The end is near!
We are all going to die!

450
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:29,957
This town is really
going to Hell lately.

451
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:32,131
What part of town
do you live in?

452
00:29:32,592 --> 00:29:34,501
I have an apartment.
I'm not sure where.

453
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,428
My dog knows, though.

454
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:38,169
You have a dog? What kind?

455
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,553
I don't know.
I'd ask him...

456
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:42,342
but he's uptown
meeting his contacts.

457
00:29:42,811 --> 00:29:45,100
Say "Mr Beefy." Say it.

458
00:29:45,564 --> 00:29:46,477
Mr Beefy.

459
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,055
And I love you!

460
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:51,395
You go to school?
What's that like?

461
00:29:51,862 --> 00:29:54,732
I go
to Parsons School of Design.

462
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:57,191
I knew growing up
I wasn't much to look at...

463
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,660
so I concentrated on
making things that are pretty.

464
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:03,991
You have a nice smell
coming off you.

465
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,542
That's my perfume.

466
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:08,994
It's called
Comme de Sud Pacific.

467
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:11,751
I think that's French
for "Coconuts."

468
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:19,681
That's better than the gelati.

469
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,260
Valerie, it feels like there's
a bunch of butterflies...

470
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:25,766
flapping around
in my stomach right now.

471
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:27,510
Is that normal?

472
00:30:27,981 --> 00:30:30,104
Sometimes, sure.

473
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:33,188
Good, because I was concerned.

474
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:36,026
Why did they do this to me?
I was good to them.

475
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,281
I can hardly notice. Honest.

476
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:44,660
I sure hope Nicky's
kicking some ass on Earth...

477
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,072
or we are doomed.

478
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,249
I was the one who created Hell.

479
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,624
I know, Your Hatefulness.

480
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:52,791
Actually, the credit
belongs to my first wife.

481
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:55,214
She was the inspiration.

482
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:57,882
Chewbacca, take it easy,
will you?

483
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:02,129
You look like my first wife.
Only she had more hair.

484
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:06,722
In another startling
announcement from City Hall...

485
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:09,595
Mayor Randolph has,
effective immediately...

486
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:14,110
Iowered the legal drinking age
from twenty-one to ten.

487
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:20,361
When an adult goes to Hell,
that's terrific.

488
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:25,361
But when a child goes...

489
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:30,162
That's why I'm in this business.

490
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:33,160
Little Nicky.

491
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,793
-Know what's nice about you?
-What?

492
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:38,258
I like the way you're happy
just being yourself.

493
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:40,676
You don't try to act cool.

494
00:31:41,138 --> 00:31:43,427
Thanks much, Valerie.

495
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:45,717
You know what's nice about you?

496
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:52,305
Your juicy heart-shaped heinie.

497
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:53,806
What was that?

498
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:58,108
I don't know why I said that.
I meant to say that...

499
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:04,535
I've always dreamt about
having sex with a gross pig.

500
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:08,411
Can I wash my winky
in your kitchen sinky?

501
00:32:08,874 --> 00:32:10,155
You're a real jerk!

502
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:12,001
I didn't mean to be.

503
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:14,252
What the--Adrian!

504
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:16,787
Dad needs you
to come back to Hell.

505
00:32:17,257 --> 00:32:19,962
So he sent old Shovel Face
to fetch me.

506
00:32:20,427 --> 00:32:22,503
I'm not kidding.
He's in trouble.

507
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:23,718
So are you.

508
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:27,099
Hey, Valerie!

509
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,355
What is your problem?

510
00:32:33,816 --> 00:32:35,607
I'm sorry!

511
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:41,446
Adrian, you froze the fire gate,
and Dad is dying...

512
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:44,363
so get your booty
back home or else!

513
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:46,321
You can't talk tough, Nicky.

514
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:49,539
Even the voice inside your head
has a speech impediment.

515
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:54,328
You're going back
because I'm going to make you!

516
00:32:54,795 --> 00:32:56,373
How about this?
I'll stay here...

517
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,006
enjoying my pizza
and my peppermint schnapps...

518
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:01,962
and you go back.

519
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:03,424
Adrian, don't!

520
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:06,889
Cut the crap! This is serious!

521
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:12,176
Come on!

522
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
I was driving to work today...

523
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:20,688
some bozo in a Cadillac
cuts me off.

524
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:22,151
So I followed him.

525
00:33:22,615 --> 00:33:24,607
When he got out of his car,
I run up behind him...

526
00:33:25,076 --> 00:33:27,115
and start bashing his brains in
with this bat.

527
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:28,906
Did you ever see
"The Untouchables"?

528
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:30,617
I was De Niro!

529
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:32,991
What's happened to you, Regis?

530
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:35,579
The mayor's office today...

531
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:38,121
along with the New York
Board of Tourism...

532
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:43,050
unveiled its new motto
to replace "I Love New York."

533
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:46,761
"I Love Hookers" will now be
the city's catch phrase.

534
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:48,966
Your brothers are upsetting
the balance...

535
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:50,714
between good and evil.

536
00:33:51,185 --> 00:33:52,300
What can I do about it?

537
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,348
You can't do jack shit...

538
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:56,308
unless you learn
your evil powers.

539
00:33:56,774 --> 00:33:58,897
Go get a soda out of the fridge.

540
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,483
But those are
my roommate's sodas.

541
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:04,235
"But those are
my roommate's sodas."

542
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:08,233
Does that sound like a statement
the son of the Devil would make?

543
00:34:08,703 --> 00:34:09,734
All right. Take it easy.

544
00:34:10,204 --> 00:34:13,573
You have the power to change
the cola in that can...

545
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,200
into any other liquid.

546
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:20,003
Engine oil, bat's blood,
moose piss.

547
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:23,002
You just have to release
the evil within.

548
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:24,666
Release the evil?

549
00:34:25,136 --> 00:34:27,888
I'm just saying
there's wickedness in you.

550
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:29,379
I can tell from your snores.

551
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:30,762
Really?

552
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:33,135
Release your evil.

553
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:36,975
Release the evil.

554
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:43,444
Come on, you can do it.

555
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,447
There it is.

556
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:47,650
You got it in you.

557
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:53,069
What are you doing?

558
00:34:57,377 --> 00:35:01,077
I'm going to pretend I didn't
see a dog on the couch...

559
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:04,999
because my brain just can't
process that right now.

560
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:07,295
But were you about
to drink one of my Cokes?

561
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:10,467
No. I was just looking at it.

562
00:35:10,932 --> 00:35:12,011
It's beautiful.

563
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:24,193
This Coke tastes like Pepsi.

564
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:33,829
You changed a Coke into a Pepsi?

565
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:36,412
That was
your big transformation?

566
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:37,870
Come on, man,
give it up a little.

567
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:39,829
It was pretty good
for my first try.

568
00:35:40,295 --> 00:35:43,545
Do you care that your brothers
are killing your father?

569
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:44,872
Yes, I care!

570
00:35:45,341 --> 00:35:48,093
And he is not going to die!

571
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:51,467
Atta-boy.

572
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:55,216
I'm freaked out.
My television just blew up.

573
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:57,594
You're damn right it did!

574
00:35:58,062 --> 00:35:59,687
I mean, really?

575
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:02,105
I know this is
your living room time...

576
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:05,058
but could I finish watching
the Globetrotters out here?

577
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:07,735
It's the craziest game
I've ever seen.

578
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,375
He's walking! Get him a bus!

579
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:23,544
This is the part I don't get.

580
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:24,919
Another terrible call.

581
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:27,208
There's no way
that was travelling.

582
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:29,633
What's with all the calls?
We haven't lost in 53 years!

583
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:31,340
Guess what, cornrows?

584
00:36:31,805 --> 00:36:35,090
Technical foul!
You're out of here!

585
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:40,724
Why's the referee being so mean
to the Globetrotters, Daddy?

586
00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:43,514
I've been watching these guys
play since I was your age.

587
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:47,103
It's all part of the show, baby.

588
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:50,528
That guy in the striped shirt...

589
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:53,030
snapped his fingers
like somebody I know!

590
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:11,797
Normally the Globetrotters
represent family entertainment.

591
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:13,840
Who gives a shit?

592
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:17,508
These kids came here to see
the Globetrotters win!

593
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:21,974
Ten points off the Globetrotters
on account of the bigmouth!

594
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:27,228
It's all part of the show, baby!

595
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:30,066
Hit the half-time buzzer.
I'm tired.

596
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,357
If the second half doesn't
get any better than this...

597
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:34,817
you can expect
a full-scale riot.

598
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:37,361
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now time...

599
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:41,412
for the Globetrotters' half-time
half-court heave-ho throw!

600
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,417
If the contestant makes it...

601
00:37:43,877 --> 00:37:45,502
everyone here
will get a free pizza pie!

602
00:37:45,962 --> 00:37:48,121
I ain't taking the shot.
These people are crazy.

603
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,212
Excuse me. I'll take that shot.

604
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:54,925
What made you want to see
the Globetrotters today, son?

605
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,844
I came for the beer
and the bitches.

606
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:02,934
Look who's back from the dead.

607
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:06,979
Six-six-six! Pickup sticks!

608
00:38:07,442 --> 00:38:10,112
Please welcome Miguel Sanchez
from the Bronx, New York!

609
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:11,484
What's Nicky doing there?

610
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:13,655
Trying to capture
his brother in a flask...

611
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:16,405
and preserve the balance
of good and evil on Earth.

612
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:19,360
-Did you just talk?
-No.

613
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:25,081
-Are you Miguel from the Bronx?
-No. I'm Nicky from the South.

614
00:38:25,544 --> 00:38:26,955
Hey, give me that!

615
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:29,870
You better win these people
some free pizza...

616
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,380
because it looks like they're
about to kill each other.

617
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:33,459
All right.

618
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:35,671
Who's that man, Mommy?

619
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:39,926
I don't know,
but he sure is butt-ugly.

620
00:38:40,392 --> 00:38:43,179
Release the evil.

621
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,977
Too much evil.

622
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:54,062
I think that ball just blew up,
and, yes, my hair is aflame.

623
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:56,156
I don't know
what the Hell that was.

624
00:38:56,617 --> 00:38:59,322
-Don't do it again, huh?
-All right.

625
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:04,283
I command you not to blow up
and go into that metal circle.

626
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:12,749
Get that crap out of here!

627
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:16,007
I know you're having fun,
Cassius...

628
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,463
but you really got
to come back to Hell.

629
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:22,679
Look around you, Nicky.
We're in Hell. The new Hell.

630
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,353
Do it! Do it! Do it!

631
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,110
I was sent here
to take you back...

632
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,485
and that's what I'm going to do.

633
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:38,569
Don't make me take out
the shovel again, Trick.

634
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:41,988
I think we're about to see
a Devil showdown.

635
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:45,864
Dad got sick when you guys left.

636
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,828
I'm glad he's dying...

637
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:51,413
because it's my turn now.

638
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:54,582
You're going to wish
you never said that.

639
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,172
Take him to the hole, Nicky.

640
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,130
I mean, woof woof.

641
00:40:05,478 --> 00:40:07,766
Come on, brother, come on!

642
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,938
Come on!

643
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:19,448
Daddy can't help you!

644
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:33,082
Enough!

645
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:38,756
This show gets better
every year!

646
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,592
That was sick.
Who taught you that shit?

647
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:43,171
Sorry, Cassius.

648
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,761
It must be the Super Devil Juice
Dad gave me.

649
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:49,220
Super Devil Juice?
Give me that, little girl.

650
00:40:49,689 --> 00:40:50,969
Don't drink out of it, please!

651
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:04,573
Now that was some straight-up
David Copperfield shit!

652
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,861
Damn you, Nicky!

653
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,241
There ain't no Super Devil Juice
in here!

654
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:10,455
Hail, Nicky!

655
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:13,789
We are forever your slaves!

656
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:22,292
-So your father's the Devil.
-S? seòor.

657
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:25,717
You're a talking dog from Hell.
You guys are who?

658
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:29,054
A couple of big fans of Nicky
and the work his dad does.

659
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,011
By the way, Nicky,
check this out.

660
00:41:37,403 --> 00:41:39,063
What's Ozzy trying to say there?

661
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,155
John, absolutely nothing.

662
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:43,941
The Blizzard always
came straight with his messages.

663
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,744
But wrap your minds around this,
gentlemen.

664
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,248
Chicago.

665
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,586
I love this song.

666
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,762
I command you
in the name of Lucifer...

667
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,179
to spread the blood
of the innocent.

668
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:09,891
Oh, my God, Chicago kicks ass!

669
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:12,093
That was awesome.

670
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:16,976
You know, guys,
this cake tastes a little funny.

671
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:20,065
I dumped a fat sack of reefer
in the mix.

672
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,439
Thought I'd spice up the bash.

673
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,734
-Really?
-What's reefer?

674
00:42:25,201 --> 00:42:27,408
About five hundred bucks
an ounce.

675
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,253
Come on, Nicky, one more time.

676
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,428
I can't. It's starting to hurt.

677
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:48,012
Come on, you totally got to!

678
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:50,633
All right, all right. Last time.

679
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,644
Here he goes!

680
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:00,189
That's insane!

681
00:43:00,653 --> 00:43:03,690
How do you do that?

682
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:07,659
I used to get messed up
like this...

683
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,827
with my first girlfriend
Heather.

684
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:14,582
We'd get so loopy,
she would forget I was a dog.

685
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:17,878
-She was a human?
-No. A sewer rat.

686
00:43:19,172 --> 00:43:21,497
Man, that pissed my parents off.

687
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,339
You know, I was in love once...

688
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,427
but she said I wasn't
financially reliable...

689
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:28,051
and she needed that.

690
00:43:28,515 --> 00:43:30,258
By "she," do you mean "he"?

691
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:32,932
-No.
-Busted!

692
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:35,511
Please.

693
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:40,726
How you feeling over there,
Satan Abdul-Jabbar?

694
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:42,902
A little strange.

695
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:46,732
I can't stop thinking
about this girl Valerie.

696
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,659
Why? Did she hurt you?

697
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,910
Do you need to cry
on my shoulder?

698
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:52,486
Easy, Liberace.

699
00:43:52,956 --> 00:43:54,664
Would you grow up?

700
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:56,619
Liberace.

701
00:43:57,085 --> 00:43:58,496
I was having the best day
with her...

702
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:02,545
until Adrian made me tell her
she had a heart-shaped heinie.

703
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:04,965
Maybe you love her.
But what do I know?

704
00:44:05,427 --> 00:44:07,716
I can't even see straight.

705
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,381
Me, too! We got to get going.

706
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:15,424
You guys can crash here.
I have an extra futon.

707
00:44:15,896 --> 00:44:18,137
That's a big pass, Elton John.

708
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:22,140
Ozzy starts in 30 minutes.
That'll cheer you up, Nicky.

709
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:23,642
Yeah, let's roll.

710
00:44:24,112 --> 00:44:27,813
I can't give the Ozz man
the full focus he deserves.

711
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:29,196
Sorry, fellas.

712
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:32,779
This chick must be
the real deal, then.

713
00:44:33,246 --> 00:44:35,204
-Later, bro.
-Good-bye, John.

714
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:36,994
-Good luck, Nicky.
-OK, Pete.

715
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:40,080
You better snap out
of it soon, kid...

716
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,621
because we're going
after Adrian tomorrow...

717
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,331
bright and early.
Night-night.

718
00:44:45,801 --> 00:44:49,383
Yeah, I know.
Get some sleep thing, Mr Beefy.

719
00:45:01,108 --> 00:45:04,892
That is the most horrifying
thing I have ever seen.

720
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:12,651
Go to her.

721
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:23,546
All right.

722
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:28,839
I smell coconuts.

723
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:33,925
Coconuts.

724
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:49,522
That dude looks like a lady.

725
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,986
You want to come in?

726
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,404
Actually, I'm looking
for a girl named Valerie.

727
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,326
Valerie Veran?
Two floors up, one window over.

728
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,536
Thanks much.

729
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,659
Good luck
with the nipple rubbing.

730
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:04,495
I don't need luck. I'm good.

731
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:06,956
I can see that.

732
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,198
Oh, my God!
Nicky, is that you?

733
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,735
Stay right there.

734
00:46:36,203 --> 00:46:37,828
I will.

735
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:49,958
What were you thinking
coming here?

736
00:46:50,426 --> 00:46:53,546
I don't know, but it didn't
involve going blind.

737
00:46:55,473 --> 00:46:56,587
Oh, my God! Nicky!

738
00:46:57,057 --> 00:46:58,931
Please don't die!

739
00:47:03,689 --> 00:47:05,349
What are you doing?

740
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:09,023
I think I'm floating.

741
00:47:09,487 --> 00:47:11,978
Why would you be floating?

742
00:47:12,448 --> 00:47:15,733
Maybe it was because
of this cake I ate earlier.

743
00:47:16,202 --> 00:47:18,574
Am I supposed to not be
freaked out right now?

744
00:47:19,038 --> 00:47:19,784
Because I am.

745
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:21,362
I'm freaked out, too.

746
00:47:21,832 --> 00:47:24,454
The butterflies in my stomach
are flapping around...

747
00:47:24,919 --> 00:47:27,588
in a way I've never felt before.

748
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:29,956
You got the wrong window again,
man.

749
00:47:30,424 --> 00:47:32,132
Oh, sorry, Nipples. Valerie!

750
00:47:32,593 --> 00:47:34,800
-Nicky, over here.
-I'm coming.

751
00:47:35,262 --> 00:47:36,591
Oh, my God, you made it.

752
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:40,674
Valerie, I can see again,
and you look beautiful.

753
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:44,096
Just because you're floating...

754
00:47:44,563 --> 00:47:46,521
doesn't mean I'm going to forget
you giving me the finger.

755
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:48,097
That wasn't me.

756
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:50,726
I was being possessed
by my brother Adrian.

757
00:47:51,195 --> 00:47:52,274
What do you mean, possessed?

758
00:47:52,738 --> 00:47:55,526
Remember when I told you
that my father was in Hell?

759
00:47:55,992 --> 00:47:58,779
That's because he's the Devil...

760
00:47:59,245 --> 00:48:02,614
and he wants to keep his throne
for another 10,000 years.

761
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:04,576
And that pissed off
my brothers...

762
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,453
so they broke
the gates of Hell...

763
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:10,620
which is making my father
decompose.

764
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,419
I love my father very much,
so I came to Earth to save him.

765
00:48:16,762 --> 00:48:18,839
Now I get that Deep South joke.

766
00:48:22,727 --> 00:48:25,348
I don't know
if I should believe you.

767
00:48:25,813 --> 00:48:27,806
You got to believe.
Believe in the butterflies.

768
00:48:28,274 --> 00:48:30,646
Wait. OK. OK, OK, I believe.

769
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,897
Come on. Come back up.

770
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,313
Take my hand, Valerie.

771
00:48:40,995 --> 00:48:44,115
Fly with me.
I can give you the power.

772
00:48:51,756 --> 00:48:53,879
That's
the Empire State Building.

773
00:48:54,342 --> 00:48:57,545
There's Popeye's chicken--
right there.

774
00:48:58,012 --> 00:49:01,179
The Hell Beast is above us...

775
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:04,558
and I can smell an evil slut.

776
00:49:05,937 --> 00:49:07,514
Whoa, Devil!

777
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:08,846
Did you do that?

778
00:49:09,315 --> 00:49:11,985
Nobody calls my girl
an evil slut.

779
00:49:13,945 --> 00:49:14,941
Good morning, New York.

780
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:16,733
This is an "Action News"
special report.

781
00:49:17,198 --> 00:49:18,194
A shocking crime...

782
00:49:18,658 --> 00:49:21,066
results in a record
fifty-million-dollar reward...

783
00:49:21,536 --> 00:49:22,995
for the capture of this man.

784
00:49:23,454 --> 00:49:24,569
His name is unknown...

785
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:27,281
but his actions have earned him
the label "The Monster."

786
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,206
He should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

787
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,164
The man who caused
such a sensation...

788
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,038
at the game yesterday
is no hero.

789
00:49:35,508 --> 00:49:37,916
He is, in fact, a mass murderer.

790
00:49:38,386 --> 00:49:40,592
-This is real bad.
-Where the heck is Nicky?

791
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:42,087
I have authorized a reward...

792
00:49:42,557 --> 00:49:44,514
to the person
who brings this man to me.

793
00:49:44,976 --> 00:49:46,803
It's a setup.

794
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,223
Good morning, young lady.

795
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,317
That looks like it tastes great.

796
00:49:59,074 --> 00:49:59,690
Look at that.

797
00:50:00,158 --> 00:50:02,067
Mr Beefy would like you.

798
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:04,905
Oh, look.

799
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,362
There he is!

800
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:32,458
Wait. Wait.

801
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:34,080
What is happening?

802
00:51:36,922 --> 00:51:38,167
There he is!

803
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:42,835
I'm not a monster.

804
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:51,725
Release the evil.

805
00:52:22,259 --> 00:52:24,584
Beefy, I think I'm in trouble.

806
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:26,464
The shit has hit the fan, kid.

807
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:27,796
Take a look.

808
00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:29,593
This videotape
will show what he did...

809
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:31,601
after he left the game.

810
00:52:32,644 --> 00:52:34,637
Say hello to my little friend.

811
00:52:37,149 --> 00:52:38,608
My name is Nicky...

812
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:41,356
and I'm going to kill all
you suckers for no reason.

813
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,940
That's not me! That's
that cockroach Tony Montana!

814
00:52:46,116 --> 00:52:48,488
-Difficult to watch, I know.
-This is Adrian's work.

815
00:52:48,952 --> 00:52:52,286
He superimposed your head
onto "Scarface."

816
00:52:52,748 --> 00:52:55,037
Which is probably DePalma's
third best film.

817
00:52:57,294 --> 00:52:58,243
I'm not Nicky.

818
00:52:58,712 --> 00:53:00,621
Dude, it's us. Let us in.

819
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,331
-John! Pete!
-Nicky!

820
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:05,509
There's a total mob scene
coming this way.

821
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:08,543
It looks like they're following
a giant trail of bug shit.

822
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:10,129
What do we do now, Beefy?

823
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:12,259
I don't know. This is
a little out of my league.

824
00:53:12,726 --> 00:53:15,264
-What would your dad do, Nicky?
-That's a great idea!

825
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:17,188
I'll ask him. Kill me.

826
00:53:17,648 --> 00:53:18,597
Are you serious?

827
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:22,186
Yes. We'll meet
at Grand Central Station, noon.

828
00:53:22,653 --> 00:53:24,396
Now I command you--do me.

829
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,859
All right!

830
00:53:31,203 --> 00:53:32,781
That just hurt a lot.

831
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:34,196
Still alive, though.

832
00:53:34,665 --> 00:53:36,539
I've always wanted
to kill someone.

833
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:38,709
Can I give it a try?

834
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:45,132
Damn you, Kevin Spacey!

835
00:53:45,593 --> 00:53:48,712
You take all my parts!

836
00:53:50,181 --> 00:53:51,972
Hey, you lose--royal flush.

837
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:53,346
Off with the brassiere.

838
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:56,929
The last time I saw
a pair of jugs that big...

839
00:53:57,396 --> 00:53:59,140
two hillbillies
were blowing on them.

840
00:54:04,445 --> 00:54:06,603
Oh, my God, Dad.

841
00:54:07,073 --> 00:54:09,777
Nicky, I got no legs.

842
00:54:10,242 --> 00:54:11,440
I got no hips.

843
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:13,369
I got one ear.

844
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:14,659
I got no ears.

845
00:54:15,122 --> 00:54:17,162
Now he has no ears.
Are you happy, Nicky?

846
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,831
Adrian's got the whole city
following me.

847
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:21,575
I can't hear you, Nicky!

848
00:54:22,046 --> 00:54:23,457
Check one, two. Check one, two.

849
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:24,836
Put it back on my head!

850
00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:27,837
You got until midnight tonight.

851
00:54:28,302 --> 00:54:31,802
Get your ass back up there,
and save your father. Go!

852
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:34,471
-I'm going to save you, Dad.
-Go, go, go!

853
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:37,176
-I'm going to save you!
-Go, then! Move it!

854
00:54:37,645 --> 00:54:38,890
Go, Nicky, go!

855
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:40,553
Sure you're down with this?

856
00:54:41,023 --> 00:54:43,063
A little nervous. Want to puke.

857
00:54:44,068 --> 00:54:47,104
Hey, hey, fuzz.
We know where to find Nicky.

858
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:53,534
-Let's go.
-Get in.

859
00:54:54,245 --> 00:54:55,158
What's up, Police Chief?

860
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:58,029
-You have what I want.
-You got what we want?

861
00:54:58,499 --> 00:55:00,492
Fifty million bones, bro.

862
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,584
-Here's the money.
-Whoa, my God!

863
00:55:03,045 --> 00:55:05,121
That's half of it. You get
the rest when I get Nicky.

864
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,788
Thanks much.

865
00:55:07,258 --> 00:55:09,666
I got to warn you, man.
He's kind of not human.

866
00:55:10,136 --> 00:55:12,805
-Really?
-He might be the son of Satan.

867
00:55:21,314 --> 00:55:23,437
I guess I'll have to be
extra careful, then, aren't l?

868
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,857
Now, where is he?

869
00:55:27,153 --> 00:55:28,861
Hey, come on, that was cool!

870
00:55:29,322 --> 00:55:30,484
Do it again!

871
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,448
Out of the way!

872
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:43,833
Where is he? He's late.

873
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:46,288
He'll be here.
Just keep your skirt on.

874
00:55:46,756 --> 00:55:48,001
That's where he comes out of.

875
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:49,841
Over there!

876
00:55:51,177 --> 00:55:52,340
We've been ratted out.

877
00:55:52,804 --> 00:55:55,758
We thought the son of Satan
would understand such a move.

878
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:58,845
-Get these two out of here.
-All right, this way.

879
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:03,142
What is this?
A bulldog and his gay lover?

880
00:56:03,606 --> 00:56:04,436
Oh, shut up.

881
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:06,691
It's true. It's true.

882
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:08,017
Judas.

883
00:56:08,486 --> 00:56:10,443
Judas Priest, maybe.

884
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:13,396
I'm only an actor.
I don't know what's happening.

885
00:56:13,866 --> 00:56:16,025
Take him to the holding area.
Seal off all the exits.

886
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:18,985
I'm only an actor!

887
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,071
You want to see something cool?

888
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:23,870
Definitely.

889
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,094
Pick me a winner.

890
00:56:37,182 --> 00:56:38,557
Oh, sick!

891
00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:41,555
Oh, my God, that was awesome!

892
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:47,518
So, what time's
my brother expected back?

893
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:51,020
Noon. Ish.

894
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:53,314
Even though you're
not really the chief...

895
00:56:53,782 --> 00:56:55,406
we still get the rest
of the cash, right, bro?

896
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:57,242
You know what you'll get, boys?

897
00:56:57,702 --> 00:56:59,446
An indescribably
horrific torture...

898
00:56:59,913 --> 00:57:03,198
administered by demons
for the rest of eternity.

899
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:05,209
And we get to keep the cash,
too, right?

900
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:06,748
Sure.

901
00:57:07,212 --> 00:57:08,540
Why not?

902
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:10,713
You're hurting me.

903
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:12,337
Shut up.

904
00:57:22,894 --> 00:57:25,515
Applesauce every time.

905
00:57:25,981 --> 00:57:26,846
Hey, boys!

906
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,474
You want a blizzard
with my flip-flop?

907
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:32,897
No, thanks, but we'll take
that bottle of booze.

908
00:57:34,114 --> 00:57:35,572
Beat it, you freak.
Get out of here.

909
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:38,404
I'll be back with my flip-flop!

910
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:43,904
Schnapps.

911
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:48,200
Peppermint?

912
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,248
All right!

913
00:57:52,924 --> 00:57:54,003
Want a hit?

914
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:57,753
Drink up.
Here's to fifty million clams.

915
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:00,926
To the defilement of Earth
and corruption of its people.

916
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:03,384
OK, whatever.
Just drink it.

917
00:58:03,852 --> 00:58:04,883
Cheers.

918
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,568
It's awfully hot down here.

919
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:21,900
How do you manage
to stay so cool?

920
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:26,405
Beer lowers
the body temperature.

921
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:30,659
I read that in a beer magazine.

922
00:58:32,047 --> 00:58:34,834
This liquid
will probably quench my thirst.

923
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:38,128
-Cool me off.
-Definitely.

924
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:40,920
Give you a pretty good buzz.

925
00:58:45,018 --> 00:58:48,352
Or maybe it will trap me inside
for all of eternity.

926
00:58:48,814 --> 00:58:51,483
No, it won't?

927
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:55,607
Oh, Nicky.
I've missed you.

928
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:57,945
Come out and say hello!

929
00:58:58,407 --> 00:58:59,865
I'm not Nicky.

930
00:59:00,325 --> 00:59:02,401
I'm calling you out, brother!

931
00:59:05,664 --> 00:59:09,199
Adrian, this is very painful.

932
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:26,548
-There you are.
-I told you he was sick.

933
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:28,181
Oh, hello, Cassius.

934
00:59:28,645 --> 00:59:30,104
All right, Adrian! Let me out!

935
00:59:30,564 --> 00:59:33,518
New Hell really only needs
one new Satan.

936
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:35,395
You motherfu--

937
00:59:35,861 --> 00:59:38,981
But Cassius could use
some company for eternity.

938
00:59:40,115 --> 00:59:41,194
So get in the flask.

939
00:59:41,658 --> 00:59:42,857
Kick his ass, Nicky.

940
00:59:43,327 --> 00:59:44,073
Sleep.

941
00:59:44,536 --> 00:59:45,947
You got it.

942
00:59:50,459 --> 00:59:53,128
Hey, hold up.
Someone's got to take a pee.

943
00:59:56,256 --> 00:59:58,830
That dog's got smoke balls!

944
01:00:01,095 --> 01:00:04,261
Run, Beefy! Run!

945
01:00:04,723 --> 01:00:06,348
You can't make me drink, Adrian.

946
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:07,888
Of course I can.

947
01:00:12,606 --> 01:00:15,393
Oh, it's Nicky's
little ragamuffin.

948
01:00:15,859 --> 01:00:17,104
Drink or she dies.

949
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:20,025
Unlike you, she won't come back
from where she's going.

950
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:25,785
Let go of her!
This is between you and me!

951
01:00:26,245 --> 01:00:29,744
I hear a train a-coming!

952
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,828
Adrian, stop!

953
01:00:33,294 --> 01:00:35,998
-Drink!
-All right! Don't hurt her!

954
01:00:37,172 --> 01:00:38,086
Don't do it, Nicky!

955
01:00:38,549 --> 01:00:40,376
I have to, Valerie.

956
01:00:53,397 --> 01:00:56,268
Now, that hurt the both of us.

957
01:01:08,996 --> 01:01:10,159
See you in Hell!

958
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:18,546
Hey, look at the bright side.
You can go for a swim.

959
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:21,799
You can play the harmonica,
and you can choke someone.

960
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:24,335
Take me to my room.
I want to be alone!

961
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:26,713
In your weakened condition,
if you vacate the throne...

962
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:29,850
any of your sons can claim
the seat of power for their own.

963
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:32,053
Horseshit.

964
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,263
Hey, good news.
Adrian's back.

965
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,059
I'm going to be all right?

966
01:01:38,025 --> 01:01:38,725
Where's Nicky?

967
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:40,652
He came with you and Cassius,
right?

968
01:01:41,112 --> 01:01:42,606
I came through that gate alone.

969
01:01:43,072 --> 01:01:44,650
Sorry, sir. False alarm.

970
01:01:46,075 --> 01:01:47,700
Would everyone stop
playing with me...

971
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,402
and tell me
what my brother's up to?

972
01:02:10,766 --> 01:02:12,593
What is this?

973
01:02:24,989 --> 01:02:27,562
Is it Dad's birthday?

974
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:37,121
There he is.

975
01:02:37,585 --> 01:02:39,412
Hi! I can't believe you're here!

976
01:02:39,879 --> 01:02:40,709
Welcome.

977
01:02:41,172 --> 01:02:42,714
Up with the sign.

978
01:02:45,176 --> 01:02:47,252
Can I just tell you
I am so excited right now?

979
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,009
-So excited!
-She really is.

980
01:02:50,473 --> 01:02:52,015
If you could point me
to the Black Palace...

981
01:02:52,475 --> 01:02:54,966
I really got to check in
with my dad.

982
01:02:57,188 --> 01:02:59,644
Can I ask you something?

983
01:03:00,108 --> 01:03:01,650
What do you know about your mom?

984
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,390
My mom.

985
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:07,147
My brothers tell me
that she was a mountain goat...

986
01:03:07,615 --> 01:03:09,940
which would explain
my chronic halitosis.

987
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:12,367
A mountain goat?
That's really sweet.

988
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:13,943
Jenna, chair.

989
01:03:15,874 --> 01:03:17,036
Thanks.

990
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:20,209
My mother wasn't a goat?

991
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,544
Try an angel.

992
01:03:23,006 --> 01:03:26,256
An angel?

993
01:03:26,718 --> 01:03:27,963
I'm your mom.

994
01:03:31,014 --> 01:03:35,474
If you're my mom,
then how come you're not older?

995
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,892
Angels don't get any older, son.

996
01:03:38,354 --> 01:03:41,106
I can't believe
you just called him "son."

997
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:43,891
This is so wild!

998
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:51,532
Jenna, Christa.
Time for your mambo lesson.

999
01:03:51,993 --> 01:03:54,449
Chubbs, I'm so sorry.
I totally spaced.

1000
01:03:54,913 --> 01:03:56,822
I have company.
This is my son Nicky.

1001
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:00,407
Chubbs used to be a golf pro...

1002
01:04:00,877 --> 01:04:02,668
but up here he's just
the dopest dance instructor.

1003
01:04:03,129 --> 01:04:03,959
Ah, that's nice.

1004
01:04:04,422 --> 01:04:05,418
You mambo?

1005
01:04:05,882 --> 01:04:06,831
I don't think so.

1006
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,052
It's all in the hips.

1007
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:14,595
-Bye, Chubbs.
-All in the hips, yeah!

1008
01:04:15,058 --> 01:04:16,552
Nobody in this room
will tell you a thing, Adrian.

1009
01:04:17,018 --> 01:04:18,097
Right!

1010
01:04:19,145 --> 01:04:20,308
Hey, let him go!

1011
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:25,356
Perhaps a titty-twister
will loosen your lips.

1012
01:04:27,028 --> 01:04:27,977
I'm getting turned on.

1013
01:04:28,446 --> 01:04:30,772
All I know is that if you
sit on that throne...

1014
01:04:31,241 --> 01:04:32,901
in your father's
weakened condition--

1015
01:04:33,368 --> 01:04:34,068
Tit-head, no!

1016
01:04:34,536 --> 01:04:37,905
You can claim the seat of power
for your own.

1017
01:04:39,749 --> 01:04:40,745
Really?

1018
01:04:41,209 --> 01:04:42,538
As the founder of Hell...

1019
01:04:43,003 --> 01:04:45,079
I command you
to stay off that throne!

1020
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:48,839
Even in Hell I get no respect.

1021
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:51,258
Put me down!

1022
01:05:14,618 --> 01:05:16,575
So where did you meet Dad?

1023
01:05:17,037 --> 01:05:20,121
It was a long time ago
at this Heaven-Hell mixer.

1024
01:05:20,582 --> 01:05:23,120
I remember that night.
You had, like, four daiquiris.

1025
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:24,451
At first
I didn't really like him.

1026
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,327
-He was really conceited.
-But he was funny.

1027
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:30,715
And I hate to admit it,
but he had a really hot body.

1028
01:05:32,844 --> 01:05:34,303
Puppy phone.

1029
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:36,756
It's so cute.

1030
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,466
Hi, Michelle.
Yeah, he's here right now.

1031
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:42,260
I don't know if he's hot.
He's my son, you perv.

1032
01:05:42,729 --> 01:05:43,974
Can I call you back?

1033
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:47,649
That was my friend Michelle.
She says hi.

1034
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,485
Say hi back.

1035
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:51,519
I'll just call her later.

1036
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,562
We totally saw you
save your girlfriend's life.

1037
01:05:55,033 --> 01:05:55,650
That was so cool.

1038
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,945
That's why you came to Heaven
instead of Hell.

1039
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,072
Self-sacrifice
automatically gets you here.

1040
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:01,570
How did you see me?

1041
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,958
We can see anything
that's going on on Earth. Look.

1042
01:06:06,211 --> 01:06:07,409
Someone else is taking
the internship.

1043
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,121
That's "Felicity."
I love that show. Do you watch?

1044
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,879
I haven't seen it,
but I hear good things.

1045
01:06:15,095 --> 01:06:16,969
This is an "Action News"
special report.

1046
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:20,551
Moments ago, a large chunk
of what appears to be Hell...

1047
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,390
began to rise
from beneath Central Park.

1048
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,597
Far from being terrified...

1049
01:06:26,064 --> 01:06:28,057
many New Yorkers have begun
flocking to the site...

1050
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:31,147
turning it into an unofficial
party central.

1051
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:32,940
And this just in...

1052
01:06:33,405 --> 01:06:36,904
I'm cheating on my husband
with the weatherman.

1053
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,321
Show him Central Park.

1054
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,163
I love your legs.

1055
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,223
That's my father's throne!

1056
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,559
-Is Dad OK?
-Let's see.

1057
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:07,978
I was a good Devil, wasn't l?

1058
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,599
You were the best Devil, sir!

1059
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,559
If we fall in there,
we will die. Period.

1060
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:16,781
My underwear is so far up my ass
I could taste it.

1061
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,071
I hear that.

1062
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,737
Welcome to the party!

1063
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,536
It's so nice
to see you all here.

1064
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,243
I'm so proud of you.

1065
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,461
You've taken to sin
with such minimal prompting.

1066
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:40,713
You're acting as if
there is no Heaven or Hell.

1067
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,803
Well, I've got news for you.

1068
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:54,016
There is most definitely a Hell.

1069
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,269
What?

1070
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,858
And you're all
going there when you die.

1071
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,575
Which is in about
fifteen minutes.

1072
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,872
Holy shit,
we really are going to die!

1073
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,914
I'm really burning now!

1074
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,960
What are we going to do?

1075
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,885
I got to help her.

1076
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,053
I got to help Dad.

1077
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,257
I got to help everybody.

1078
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:24,673
At the stroke of midnight...

1079
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,847
my father will be
completely deteriorated...

1080
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:31,479
and all your souls will be mine.

1081
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,269
Soon you will see things...

1082
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,810
more horrible
than you can even imagine.

1083
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,530
Well, maybe not that horrible,
but still pretty bad.

1084
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,328
So, while we wait...

1085
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,116
for your enjoyment...

1086
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,704
I bring you a dear, sweet man--

1087
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,705
Mr Henry Winkler.

1088
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:54,828
Good evening.

1089
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,006
Covered in bees!

1090
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,471
How can I win?

1091
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,968
Adrian is stronger
and smarter than me.

1092
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,181
Stronger, yes.

1093
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,269
Smarter, definitely.

1094
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,604
But you have something
that he doesn't have.

1095
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:15,307
A speech impediment?

1096
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,195
The inner light, honey.

1097
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,030
And you can totally use it.

1098
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,063
-It's the best power of all.
-I do?

1099
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,488
And God told me if you
get in really bad trouble...

1100
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,330
you can use this.

1101
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,498
What is it?

1102
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,501
I'm not totally
a hundred percent on that...

1103
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,630
but God said when the time came,
you'd know what to do with it.

1104
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:36,954
God's so smart.

1105
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,048
Like "Jeopardy!" smart.

1106
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,252
My little boy.

1107
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:46,391
Mommy,
get me to the Big Apple...

1108
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:50,016
because I'm going to
rock that town like a hurricane.

1109
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:51,806
You're already there.

1110
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,267
Bye, Nicky.

1111
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,142
Bye, Mom.

1112
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,067
Bye, guys.

1113
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,280
Release the good.

1114
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,256
Yes, they're furry.

1115
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,546
Bunny, bunny, bunny!

1116
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:27,171
Release the awesome.

1117
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:33,391
What you do is put it
in your mouth...

1118
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:37,983
and let the meat slide down
your throat hole.

1119
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:41,398
Not you, not you!

1120
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:48,409
Popeye's chicken
is the shizzney!

1121
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:11,221
You know, from this angle,
you're kind of cute.

1122
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:12,883
You think so?

1123
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:15,720
Oh, my God.

1124
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,431
He just opened his mouth
and swallowed that spit.

1125
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,735
That turn you on there, RuPaul?

1126
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,235
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1127
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:32,989
Little Nicky.

1128
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,079
I knew you would make it!

1129
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:39,876
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely.

1130
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,627
Let my friends alone...

1131
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,084
and get in the flask.

1132
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:46,334
Is this a joke?

1133
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,428
No, it's the inner light...

1134
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:51,593
and with it,
we can defeat whatever you got.

1135
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,303
It's true!

1136
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:58,731
It's not true!

1137
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,315
Run, traitors, run!

1138
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:05,107
OK, Adrian.

1139
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:08,324
You've left me no choice.

1140
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,130
Leave this to me.

1141
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:26,292
Let's see what you've got.

1142
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:13,217
Enough!

1143
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:17,518
I'm going to kill you
with my bare hands.

1144
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:19,258
I'm ready for you.

1145
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:22,266
I guess I wasn't ready.

1146
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,072
-I totally had to do that.
-Hell, yeah!

1147
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,454
-Good job!
-That's great!

1148
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,327
Thanks, Mom !

1149
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:50,631
I'm going to ask you nicely.

1150
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:53,004
Get in the fla--

1151
01:13:53,472 --> 01:13:56,259
You want a pillow fight, do you?

1152
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:59,216
Let's let the feathers fly.

1153
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:02,016
Come on, now.

1154
01:14:05,401 --> 01:14:06,681
Come on.

1155
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:11,652
I'm right here.
Where am I going with it, baby?

1156
01:14:12,116 --> 01:14:13,147
Here I am.

1157
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:18,027
I'm sleeping.

1158
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:19,660
Or am l?

1159
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:24,666
Thanks, Mr Winkler.

1160
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:27,418
I'm asking you one last time.

1161
01:14:27,882 --> 01:14:29,921
Get in the flask.

1162
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:32,258
A little help here, please.

1163
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:35,511
Please!

1164
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:38,594
Don't do this! No!

1165
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:46,018
Good-bye, Nicky.

1166
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:57,107
Nice to see you, brothers.

1167
01:14:57,578 --> 01:14:59,369
Now I'm going to bust
both of your heads wide open!

1168
01:15:06,462 --> 01:15:08,122
-Come on!
-Get 'em, Nicky!

1169
01:15:08,589 --> 01:15:09,585
Come on, Nicky!

1170
01:15:10,049 --> 01:15:13,916
You can do it, Nicky!
Kick him in his hairy balls!

1171
01:15:14,387 --> 01:15:15,845
Good idea.

1172
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,255
One down, one to go, Adrian.

1173
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,634
You've asked for this.
Time for the shovel!

1174
01:15:22,103 --> 01:15:23,976
Bring it on!

1175
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:26,597
-Kill him, Adrian!
-Shut up!

1176
01:15:27,066 --> 01:15:29,023
-Get him, Nicky!
-Let go of me!

1177
01:16:00,975 --> 01:16:04,011
How did a nice Southern boy
learn to fight like that?

1178
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,479
I guess from my father's side
of the family.

1179
01:16:23,164 --> 01:16:26,497
What? No tongue?

1180
01:16:34,425 --> 01:16:35,706
Catch me if you can!

1181
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:37,340
That is wicked!

1182
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,802
Not long now!

1183
01:16:48,898 --> 01:16:49,598
You got to fly out.

1184
01:16:50,066 --> 01:16:51,441
Soon it will all be mine!

1185
01:16:51,901 --> 01:16:53,775
Nicky! I know you can do it.

1186
01:16:54,237 --> 01:16:55,233
Run, run!

1187
01:16:55,697 --> 01:16:57,072
Do it for the butterflies.

1188
01:16:57,532 --> 01:16:59,156
Butterflies?

1189
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,200
The power of good
lets you fly out.

1190
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:09,126
Well, you're too late, Nicky!

1191
01:17:11,004 --> 01:17:13,921
Behold your new Satan!

1192
01:17:15,091 --> 01:17:17,629
What's that?
What's with the ball?

1193
01:17:22,724 --> 01:17:24,847
-Ozzy?
-Holy shit.

1194
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:28,516
No, no, no!

1195
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,391
You can do it, Ozzy!

1196
01:17:30,857 --> 01:17:32,980
Bite his fricking head off!

1197
01:17:36,154 --> 01:17:37,352
Spit him in the flask!

1198
01:17:37,822 --> 01:17:38,853
Here you go, Ozzy.

1199
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:46,908
-Grand Central, Nicky!
-Start running.

1200
01:17:47,373 --> 01:17:48,618
-You'll never make it.
-You've got to die.

1201
01:17:49,084 --> 01:17:50,198
I'll just go to Heaven.

1202
01:17:50,668 --> 01:17:53,206
Not if you do something bad
right before you die.

1203
01:17:53,671 --> 01:17:54,537
You're right.

1204
01:17:55,006 --> 01:17:56,798
Hey, Nicky!
Cover Winkler in bees!

1205
01:17:57,258 --> 01:17:58,456
You can do it!

1206
01:17:59,886 --> 01:18:01,713
Sorry, Henry.

1207
01:18:03,973 --> 01:18:05,551
-Do me!
-With what?

1208
01:18:06,017 --> 01:18:06,966
I don't know.

1209
01:18:07,435 --> 01:18:09,642
Here. Kill him with this.

1210
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:12,683
I'll never forget you, guys.

1211
01:18:13,149 --> 01:18:16,684
And we will never forget you,
my friend.

1212
01:18:22,909 --> 01:18:24,783
I love you.

1213
01:18:25,245 --> 01:18:27,700
And I love you, Nicky.

1214
01:18:36,047 --> 01:18:39,416
I got them, Dad! I did it!

1215
01:18:42,095 --> 01:18:45,013
Unholiness, you're back!

1216
01:18:46,224 --> 01:18:47,600
You look great!

1217
01:18:48,059 --> 01:18:49,554
It's all in the hips

1218
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,977
It's in the hips

1219
01:18:54,941 --> 01:18:56,139
You're all right!

1220
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:57,808
You came through, Nicky.

1221
01:18:58,278 --> 01:18:59,820
I came through for you, Dad...

1222
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:03,779
and I came through
for Mom and the butterflies.

1223
01:19:04,242 --> 01:19:06,034
You're back in Hell now, kid.

1224
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,072
There are no butterflies here.

1225
01:19:08,538 --> 01:19:11,112
If you want butterflies,
you need to be on Earth.

1226
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:17,456
What about you and Grandpa
and everybody in Hell?

1227
01:19:17,923 --> 01:19:21,541
I let my butterflies die
once upon a time...

1228
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:24,050
and it's never stopped hurting.

1229
01:19:24,513 --> 01:19:25,592
That's right!

1230
01:19:26,056 --> 01:19:27,384
You heard me, Holly.

1231
01:19:27,849 --> 01:19:28,631
What?

1232
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:30,511
I'm still in love with you!

1233
01:19:30,977 --> 01:19:32,637
Oh, my God,
he's talking about me.

1234
01:19:33,105 --> 01:19:36,059
And don't think I forgot
about how crazy you get...

1235
01:19:36,525 --> 01:19:38,601
after a few daiquiris.

1236
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:43,949
That guy is still
the biggest horndog.

1237
01:19:44,408 --> 01:19:45,688
Yeah, he is.

1238
01:19:47,035 --> 01:19:49,111
Listen, I got down low.

1239
01:19:49,579 --> 01:19:52,415
Your mom's got up high.

1240
01:19:52,874 --> 01:19:54,285
You take care of the middle.

1241
01:19:54,751 --> 01:19:56,543
OK, Dad.

1242
01:19:57,004 --> 01:20:01,084
But, in the words
of Motley Crue...

1243
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:05,382
this will always be
my home sweet home.

1244
01:20:05,846 --> 01:20:07,470
Don't be afraid
to show your face.

1245
01:20:07,931 --> 01:20:09,971
You're such a handsome boy.

1246
01:20:12,686 --> 01:20:14,394
I hate to interrupt...

1247
01:20:14,855 --> 01:20:17,227
but it's time
for Hitler's punishment.

1248
01:20:17,691 --> 01:20:19,518
-I'll take that.
-Maybe they'll let us out.

1249
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:20,815
Grandpa!

1250
01:20:21,278 --> 01:20:22,476
OK, kids.

1251
01:20:22,946 --> 01:20:24,571
Enjoy your new home!

1252
01:20:26,533 --> 01:20:29,238
Holy shnit!

1253
01:20:38,253 --> 01:20:40,542
Such a little angel.

1254
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:43,038
Only a quarter, ma'am.

1255
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,336
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

1256
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,508
Sorry.
