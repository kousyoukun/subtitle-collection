1
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:37,104
Let me show you
what I made today.

2
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,476
I can't wait.

3
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:41,604
I need to go upstairs
and change...

4
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,779
and then I'll start dinner.

5
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:07,004
Oh, yes, it's ladies night,
and the feel--

6
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:08,930
Showtime.

7
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:15,594
Rough day at the office,
Mrs Dunleavy?

8
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:18,815
You'll feel better once you
get out of those work clothes.

9
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,564
And into some sweats.

10
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:28,779
I wish you'd let me
rub those feet.

11
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,651
Of course,
I wouldn't use my hands.

12
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:48,168
I think Victoria
just told me her secret.

13
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:58,396
Deedly dee.
Are those things for me?

14
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:05,649
Mom, coming in.

15
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:08,604
Scottie Dunleavy?

16
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:11,316
What unfortunate timing.

17
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:15,914
Get out. Don't you know
this is naughty time?

18
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:17,536
I'll get it.

19
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:23,285
Hello, Scottie. Why don't you
be a good little boy...

20
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:26,425
go downstairs
and let your mother get comfy?

21
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:27,963
Who is this?

22
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:30,965
This is a big bird who wants
to see the rest of Mommy.

23
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,057
Oh, my God, Scottie.
Is that a man up our tree?

24
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:43,144
No, no.
Tell her it's just a big bird.

25
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:07,507
Hey, pal, welcome.

26
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:10,921
Welcome to what? Where am l?

27
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:13,759
Aren't you that horny guy who
was pretending to be a big bird?

28
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,346
Checking out that beautiful mom?

29
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:18,007
Yes, I am.

30
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:21,728
Now you'll see what a big horny
bird actually looks like...

31
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:23,732
in Hell!

32
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:37,201
I deserve this!

33
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,693
-Knock, knock.
-Hey, Jimmy.

34
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,397
-What are you doing, Nicky?
-Just jamming.

35
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:16,571
Your father wants you and your
brothers in the throne room.

36
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,993
He's not retiring today, is he?

37
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:21,163
He wants to talk to you
and Cassius and Adrian...

38
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:24,031
about who'll rule Hell
for the next 10,000 years.

39
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:27,075
Why do I need to go?
He won't pick me.

40
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:30,500
I happen to think
you'd make a great Devil.

41
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,754
I'm not into evil and torture
and all that stuff.

42
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,971
Plus, the Prince of Darkness
should look distinguished...

43
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:40,551
and let's face facts,
I'm no George Clooney.

44
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:42,975
You're not
a bad-looking guy, Nicky.

45
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:44,896
Look at that picture.

46
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:48,847
I used to talk normal, too...

47
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:52,568
before Cassius hit me
in the face with a shovel.

48
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,817
That's me now, and I accept it.

49
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:59,071
Your brothers are two of
the sickest guys I've ever seen.

50
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:02,028
For some reason, you're not.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

51
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:05,748
Their mothers were fire dragons
and mine was a goat.

52
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,373
How do I compete with that?

53
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:11,087
Your mother was not a goat.
They're just playing with you.

54
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:14,799
If one of those psychos
gets picked, I'm doomed.

55
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,300
I knew it, Adrian.
He's finally retiring.

56
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:22,971
Cassius, I've been waiting on
this day for 10,000 years.

57
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,760
If the old man picks me
to take over Hell...

58
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:31,478
I'll keep torture going 24-7.
No breaks.

59
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:32,975
Whoa, mama!

60
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:36,019
You got him right in the eye.

61
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,444
Hey! How's Daddy's
little girl doing today?

62
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,532
I didn't see you guys.
What's up?

63
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,036
Shovel face,
you want to mind-wrestle?

64
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:46,579
Nah, I'm all right.

65
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:48,869
I was thinking of chilling out
by the throne for a bit.

66
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,625
I'm going to mind-wrestle you
whether you like it or not.

67
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:54,545
I have to warn you,
I'm getting pretty good at it.

68
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,381
Then I guess
I can't make you do this.

69
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:01,546
Mercy. You win.
I give. Game over.

70
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:03,296
What are you boys doing?

71
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,847
Nothing, Dad. Just hitting
the old punching bags.

72
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,395
Cassius...

73
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:14,777
didn't I tell you to stay out
of your brother's mind?

74
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:16,648
I forgot.

75
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,906
Maybe this
will help you remember.

76
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:25,580
Now, everybody come sit down.

77
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,329
-Hey, Dad.
-Yes, son?

78
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:29,907
I know you got a lot
on your mind...

79
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:33,414
but I almost finished that
Monsters of Metal compilation.

80
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:35,921
I really think it's turning
into a masterpiece.

81
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,878
OK, kid.
We'll listen to it later.

82
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:39,803
Thanks.

83
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:45,846
A window.

84
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,225
Hello, Mr Devil.
I like your cape.

85
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,321
I deserve this!

86
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:05,575
Fellas, this,
as some of you might know...

87
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,822
is my 10,000th year
as Prince of Darkness...

88
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:13,412
so I think the time has come
to discuss who will succeed me.

89
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,335
-Knock, knock.
-Yes, Jimmy?

90
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:17,878
Don't forget--

91
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:21,711
you're shoving a pineapple
up Hitler's ass at four p.m.

92
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:27,723
This was a very
difficult decision...

93
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:30,855
because I have
three wonderful sons.

94
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:35,062
Adrian--so smart, so ruthless.

95
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:36,557
Wears makeup.

96
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:40,895
And Cassius--
so strong, so tough.

97
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,192
Don't forget clinically insane.

98
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,319
And Nicky...

99
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:48,489
such a sweet boy.

100
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:55,041
But after much thought
and careful consideration...

101
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:58,671
I've decided that the ruler
for the next 10,000 years...

102
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,592
is going to have to be...

103
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:04,217
me.

104
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,091
-What?
-Hallelujah!

105
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,882
I mean, that sucks!

106
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,593
The important thing
for the stability of our rule...

107
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:14,470
is to maintain the balance
between good and evil...

108
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:18,274
and I don't think any of you are
ready for that responsibility.

109
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:20,645
Dad, this is bullshit!

110
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:24,031
I don't like that language.

111
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:27,818
Right. Send him in.

112
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:29,912
Sorry, boys.
I have to get back to work.

113
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:31,867
It was good
hanging with you, Dad.

114
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,329
I'll check you later.

115
00:08:58,776 --> 00:08:59,939
You're serious?

116
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,199
Off, off, off!

117
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:16,657
Damn!

118
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:19,120
Twenty thousand years ago,
Grandpa Lucifer said...

119
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:23,254
"It's better to rule in Hell
than to serve in Heaven."

120
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:26,802
Well, I'm tired
of serving in Hell.

121
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:30,466
We need somewhere
where we can rule.

122
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,723
Bring it on, big man.
Let's see what you got.

123
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:42,899
Could you concentrate
for five seconds?

124
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:44,691
I am concentrating, man.

125
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:46,270
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,314
After careful consideration,
I must respectfully decline.

127
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,328
I can't stand retirement.

128
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:53,780
Just let me win one Super Bowl.

129
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:57,166
In exchange for eternal
damnation of your soul?

130
00:09:57,627 --> 00:10:00,248
You're much too nice a guy
for that, Mr Marino.

131
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:02,088
You did it for Namath.

132
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:03,746
Joe was coming here anyways.

133
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,592
This sucks.

134
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,462
I'll go to the Super Bowl
as an announcer...

135
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:08,924
and win myself an Emmy!

136
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:10,088
That's the spirit.

137
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,264
You're a good Devil, Dad.

138
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,394
I also happen to be a Jets fan.

139
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:18,854
What do you think about Earth?

140
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:20,892
We could create
our own Hell there.

141
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,600
Are you saying we go up there
and kill everyone?

142
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,184
Eventually, Cassius...

143
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,778
but first we'd have to corrupt
as many souls as we can...

144
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,482
so when we do destroy them...

145
00:10:30,952 --> 00:10:33,324
Their damned souls will be ours.

146
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:35,697
It's our time, brother.

147
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:45,208
This is not good.

148
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:48,253
Whoa, whoa.
Fellas, what are you doing?

149
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,751
We're leaving.

150
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,383
You can't go through there!

151
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,220
The fire flows in, not out.

152
00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:59,771
You really suck!

153
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,814
Your Evilness!

154
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:05,984
Cassius and Adrian
have escaped from Hell.

155
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:08,272
They went out through the fire
and froze it.

156
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:12,191
I tried to stop them, sir,
but they overpowered me.

157
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,781
Calm down. Get off your knees.

158
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,243
Thank you for understanding,
Your Wickedness.

159
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:25,167
You're the man.
I've always said that.

160
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,041
Are there boobs on my head?

161
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:33,090
Yeah. Big ones.

162
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:35,264
What's going on, Dad?

163
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:37,717
I'm going to die, Nicky.
The gates are broken.

164
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:41,969
No new souls can get in,
so I'll start to deteriorate.

165
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:45,066
What's with all
those "hoo hoo" noises?

166
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:46,392
Everything's fine, Pop.

167
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,735
Everything's fine?
Who are you bullshitting?

168
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:51,866
Last time you said that,
the Renaissance happened.

169
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,566
Please, Pop,
go back to your room.

170
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:56,031
Can I take him with me?

171
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:58,737
Sure, Pop. Whatever you want.

172
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,950
Tit-head, go with my father.

173
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:08,673
Not a damn soul is going
to get through that.

174
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,675
This fire is solid as rock.

175
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,926
We got to get this bad boy
burning again.

176
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:14,383
To do that,
Cassius and Adrian...

177
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:17,005
have to come back through
the other way.

178
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,506
So go get them, Dad.

179
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm too weak.
The process has already begun.

180
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,725
So go get them, Jimmy.

181
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm just a demon.
No Devil blood in me.

182
00:12:27,944 --> 00:12:30,481
I wouldn't last two minutes
with your brothers.

183
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,856
Are you saying it's up to me?

184
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,693
You said no souls
could get through that.

185
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:41,206
Nicky, are you a soul
or the spawn of Satan?

186
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,785
I never been to Earth, Dad.

187
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:46,921
I never even slept over
some other dude's house.

188
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,167
The worst thing that could
happen is you get killed.

189
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,800
In which case, boom--
you end up back here.

190
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:57,262
So I need to go to Earth
and kill my brothers?

191
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:01,424
No go. They left together
at the exact same time.

192
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:05,429
They must come back together
at the exact same time.

193
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,476
Here.

194
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,401
Get them to drink from this.

195
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,319
One sip,
and they'll be trapped inside.

196
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,156
Once you've got both of them,
bring it back through the gate.

197
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:18,325
Let me, sir.

198
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:19,901
Gross!

199
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,163
He's got less than a week.

200
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:30,046
Dad, I don't know
if I can do this.

201
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:32,582
Son, you...

202
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,509
Try your best.

203
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,116
Earth.

204
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:06,279
It doesn't look too bad.

205
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:19,379
You were gone ten seconds.
What happened?

206
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:25,304
I got hit by this big light
attached to a lot of metal.

207
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,391
That's a train, son.
Don't stand in front of them.

208
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,979
I'll have to take a mulligan
on this one.

209
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:34,313
Please, Nicky,
get back up there.

210
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:35,644
All right.

211
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,608
I'll get that for you, sir.

212
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,413
I'm Nicky.

213
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,994
That's terrific.

214
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:56,382
Now get off the track
and come with me, handsome.

215
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,211
Welcome to Grand Central Station
in New York City.

216
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,389
My name is Beefy.

217
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,509
I'm an old friend
of your father's.

218
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:06,972
He asked me to help you out.

219
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:10,354
I just want to find my brothers
and be on my way.

220
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:11,728
It's not going to be easy.

221
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:13,520
Your brothers
can possess people...

222
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:15,693
so they probably
won't look like themselves.

223
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:19,937
You have to be suspicious
of everyone.

224
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:21,606
All right, bro.

225
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:25,326
The jig is up, then.
Get in the flask.

226
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:26,986
It ain't me, moron.

227
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,737
Sorry.

228
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,873
There's this blind guy outside
you might think is possessed...

229
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,579
but he's just crazy.

230
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,256
Though I cannot see
with these blind eyes...

231
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,795
I know the good Lord
still loves me.

232
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:43,591
He loves all of his children.

233
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:45,598
-Why, he loves you...
-That's him.

234
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:47,683
...and he loves you.

235
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:50,769
Here he goes.

236
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,266
You make the Lord very nervous.

237
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:55,480
All right.

238
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:57,603
-I'm burning now.
-Take it easy.

239
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,146
Hellfire is burning me alive!

240
00:16:00,615 --> 00:16:02,903
He's burning.

241
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,324
The Beast is alive!
He's among us!

242
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:10,199
Clear the streets!
The Devil is here!

243
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:14,292
Making friends already.

244
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:16,545
I don't know
what that guy's problem was.

245
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:18,002
It's freezing up here.

246
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,458
You're in the human world now,
kid.

247
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:23,797
You'll feel a lot of new things
you never felt before.

248
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:28,095
Let's get you some warm clothes
and hot food.

249
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:40,517
Put it in your mouth.

250
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:50,241
Now move your teeth
up and down.

251
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,490
Up and down.

252
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,241
Good, numb nuts.

253
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:58,420
Now you got to swallow it.

254
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,708
Tilt your head back...

255
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:04,758
and let the meat
slide down your throat hole.

256
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:07,297
Easy. Don't choke.

257
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:14,719
Popeye's chicken
is fucking awesome.

258
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:16,849
Now eat up.
You'll need your energy.

259
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:20,234
I got energy up the ying-yang.
Let's save Dad.

260
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:22,687
Adrian! Cassius!

261
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:25,106
Oh, boy.

262
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:27,318
So nice.

263
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,703
I like your brassiere.

264
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,540
Thank you.

265
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,791
Could you guys maybe
not tell anyone about this?

266
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:42,253
You got it.

267
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:44,840
Do you mind maybe not telling
anybody about this?

268
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:46,713
You got it.

269
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:50,962
Look, sidewalk equals safety.

270
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:53,011
Middle of the road equals death.

271
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:58,270
From now on, I'll just avoid
all moving metal objects.

272
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:02,232
Great. Now, your father
gave me some deposit money...

273
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:04,901
for a nice pad
on the Upper East Side...

274
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,523
but I misplaced it.

275
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:13,742
I'm wasted!

276
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,911
So I found
this other joint for you...

277
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,084
but you're going
to have a roommate.

278
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,953
There's only one thing better...

279
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:24,166
than drinking
an ice-cold whiskey sour...

280
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:26,840
on a hot Alabama night...

281
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:29,461
and that's telling the truth.

282
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,504
I know what you think
about me, Grandma.

283
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,767
You think I'm worthless.

284
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:36,638
You think I'm a stumblebum...

285
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:39,595
who ain't never going
to amount to anything.

286
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:42,272
Well, old woman, you are wrong.

287
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:47,280
You are wrong.

288
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:54,485
Hello, friend.
My name is Nicky.

289
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,948
I understand
you are seeking a roommate...

290
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,907
as per your ad
in the "Village Voice."

291
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,869
Would it be possible for me
to fill the slot?

292
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:05,248
Don't you want
to know what rent is?

293
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,715
Yes. What is rent?

294
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,136
It's 1,200,
split down the middle.

295
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:15,385
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I rehearse with my partner...

296
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,310
so the living room's
going to be off-limits.

297
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,885
Off-limits.

298
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:21,680
Aren't you boiling hot
in that outfit?

299
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:24,854
It's 80 degrees in this hallway.
Where are you from, the South?

300
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,359
The Deep South.

301
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:38,945
-Why is that funny?
-I don't know.

302
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:44,079
OK. And sorry, guy,
but no doggies allowed.

303
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:46,954
Go on. Big day tomorrow.

304
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:49,880
And don't forget to do that
sleep thing I told you about.

305
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:50,925
Gotcha.

306
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,344
You're not my brother, are you?

307
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:54,885
I'm an only child.

308
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:56,927
You love acting.

309
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,136
I love pissing.

310
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,761
Oh, my God!

311
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:53,814
In today's Gospel...

312
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:56,240
the Lord tells us
how we should live...

313
00:20:56,702 --> 00:20:59,573
if we wish to attain
the splendour of Heaven.

314
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,498
Or something like that.

315
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,289
Jesus this, Moses that.

316
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:08,244
Abraham hit me
with a wiffle ball bat.

317
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:20,172
The Lord said a lot of hibbity
jibbity bibbity swibbity.

318
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,508
But...

319
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,229
has he ever really done
anything for any of us?

320
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:30,771
Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR
in my driveway?

321
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:32,233
No.

322
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:33,859
I love that car.

323
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:38,155
Has the Lord given
any of my enemies the herpes?

324
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:39,734
No.

325
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:44,783
The Lord gave my son
the strength to get off drugs.

326
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:47,414
Ma'am, I know your son...

327
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:50,500
and, believe me,
he was better off on the drugs.

328
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:52,922
At least
when he was smoking hashish...

329
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:55,377
he used to make me laugh
occasionally.

330
00:21:57,638 --> 00:21:59,263
After we tried for many years...

331
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:03,140
the Lord finally helped
my wife conceive a baby.

332
00:22:04,228 --> 00:22:07,679
Your best friend Fitzy
helped your wife.

333
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:12,692
He helped her conceive it
all night long.

334
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:17,901
How about you, Mayor?

335
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:19,696
Has the Lord
ever done anything for you?

336
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:24,906
Well, you know, I wished
I could think of something...

337
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:27,331
but, to be honest with you,
I can't.

338
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,284
I can't think of a damn thing
he's ever done for me!

339
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:33,672
Kind of makes you wonder
if there even is a Lord...

340
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:38,878
if there is ultimate punishment
for our so-called sins.

341
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:40,841
Why don't we just have fun...

342
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:43,928
and do whatever the Hell
we want?

343
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:47,727
Let the sin begin!

344
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:53,142
Let the sin begin.

345
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:55,105
That was a good one.

346
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,896
This is so much fun!

347
00:22:58,366 --> 00:22:59,611
I never want it to end.

348
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:03,077
Why should it end?
Who's going to stop us?

349
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,949
Come on. There's ten million
people in this city...

350
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:09,908
and the clock is ticking.

351
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:12,454
Let's rock and roll, then.

352
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:17,088
-Get in the flask.
-I'm not thirsty!

353
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:21,299
Cassius, I'll show you.

354
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:24,385
Cassius, get in the flask.

355
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:28,559
Get in the flask.

356
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:30,563
-May I help you?
-Get in the flask.

357
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,054
What are you talking about?

358
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:34,814
I'm talking about
an eight-piece. Let's go.

359
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:38,362
Look, it's OKfor me
to shit in the street...

360
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:41,740
but you got to use a toilet.

361
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,028
Nicky, where are you?

362
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:45,740
Aw, come on.

363
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:47,201
What's he doing now?

364
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:51,116
Just get in the flask.
I got to get Adrian.

365
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:01,424
Gary's so hairy.

366
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:03,430
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

367
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:11,726
All that chasing
and running around...

368
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,562
is making me want
to do the sleep thing again.

369
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:18,975
Kid, I like your enthusiasm,
but we have to work on...

370
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:21,439
narrowing down
our list of suspects.

371
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:26,451
I'm going to check in with
some of my contacts uptown.

372
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:37,415
Kid's got a lot of evil in him
just begging to come out.

373
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:07,909
I will eat your heart.

374
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,406
There's our man.

375
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:17,956
Mr Sleepyhead must have some
major ties to the dark side.

376
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:20,503
What's with that guy?

377
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:22,793
It's got to be one
of his disciples or something.

378
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:27,510
My man's into
deep nocturnal shit.

379
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,892
I think that Devil guy
just got ripped off.

380
00:25:32,353 --> 00:25:35,270
-Should we wake him up?
-You do it.

381
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:40,941
Rise and shine, Devil guy.

382
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:42,814
Some dude stole your shit.

383
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:44,823
What? Where?

384
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,110
-Which way did he go?
-That way.

385
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,821
Thanks. Give me back my flask!

386
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,248
Did you check out
the dragon mouth?

387
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,833
The Dark Prince is here.

388
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,217
Check out my stuff.
I got a comb only used twice.

389
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,937
I got a pepper shaker.
A silver doodad from Africa.

390
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:19,973
See something you like, my man?

391
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:21,818
I would like my flask back.

392
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:23,227
You calling me a thief?

393
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:25,439
I'm calling you
the guy who has my flask.

394
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:28,362
How would I have it
unless I was, in fact, a thief?

395
00:26:28,826 --> 00:26:30,984
-I don't know.
-Now you've done it.

396
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:32,829
You messed
with my business, bitch.

397
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:36,492
I would appreciate it
if you kept your voice down.

398
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:40,996
You going all crazy-eyed on me.

399
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:43,172
I'll show you some crazy eye.

400
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:46,797
Look at this.
Come on, let's get busy.

401
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:48,921
-Excuse me, sir.
-Who?

402
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:51,796
Does that flask
belong to this man?

403
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:53,725
You calling me a thief, too?
Damn.

404
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:58,052
Look, the guy you ripped off
walked by and busted you...

405
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:01,689
so why don't you just give him
his flask back?

406
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:04,820
You going to bite me with
your snaggletooth if I don't?

407
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,404
No. But that policeman
might have something to say.

408
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:15,870
Take your dumb-ass canteen,
goofy.

409
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:18,621
Get your raggedy-ass clothes
and find another corner...

410
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:20,828
before I show you
what crazy really is.

411
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:22,326
Fine. I will.

412
00:27:22,797 --> 00:27:24,836
I'm a businessman.

413
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:27,422
I'll be seeing you
in a few years.

414
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:35,342
Excuse me.

415
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,846
That was amazing.
I just wanted to thank you.

416
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:42,267
That's OK.
I get messed with all the time.

417
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:46,067
When I saw him do that to you,
I just lost it.

418
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:48,272
I hate when people
take advantage of tourists.

419
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:50,898
What makes you think
I'm a tourist?

420
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:53,573
Your accent, maybe.

421
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:55,447
Well, where are you from?

422
00:27:55,913 --> 00:27:57,657
-The South.
-Really?

423
00:27:58,124 --> 00:27:59,666
The Deep South.

424
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:08,503
Why are we laughing?

425
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:12,253
I don't know,
but I was enjoying it.

426
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:13,920
Your glasses are pretty.

427
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,928
They make your eyes
look big and sparkly.

428
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:18,721
It's fun looking at them.

429
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:21,721
My dad's an optometrist.

430
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:25,060
My dad's in Hell,
and he's falling apart.

431
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:26,855
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,814
It's really tough
when your folks get older.

433
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,949
I don't know what I would do
if I couldn't save him.

434
00:28:32,408 --> 00:28:33,950
I'm sure a nice Southern boy
like you...

435
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,525
will figure something out.

436
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:37,952
You want some Popeye's?

437
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:42,875
No. I had my lunch already.

438
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:45,791
But I wouldn't mind
getting a gelati.

439
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:48,746
Could I come with you
to getting a gelati?

440
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:50,415
If you want to.

441
00:28:53,054 --> 00:28:55,426
-Here you go, pal. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

442
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,847
It's freezing my hands.

443
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,930
-Even with those gloves on?
-It's cold.

444
00:29:01,395 --> 00:29:04,811
-Let me wrap it.
-Please. Thank you.

445
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:07,101
Gelati.

446
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,434
Better?

447
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:16,034
Why are you taunting me
with your darkness?

448
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:19,945
Your evil,
it's stinking up our streets!

449
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:25,041
The end is near!
We are all going to die!

450
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,250
This town is really
going to Hell lately.

451
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:32,424
What part of town
do you live in?

452
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:34,794
I have an apartment.
I'm not sure where.

453
00:29:35,262 --> 00:29:36,721
My dog knows, though.

454
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:38,462
You have a dog? What kind?

455
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:39,846
I don't know.
I'd ask him...

456
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:42,634
but he's uptown
meeting his contacts.

457
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:45,392
Say "Mr Beefy." Say it.

458
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,770
Mr Beefy.

459
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,347
And I love you!

460
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:51,688
You go to school?
What's that like?

461
00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:55,025
I go
to Parsons School of Design.

462
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:57,484
I knew growing up
I wasn't much to look at...

463
00:29:57,952 --> 00:30:00,953
so I concentrated on
making things that are pretty.

464
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:04,284
You have a nice smell
coming off you.

465
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:06,835
That's my perfume.

466
00:30:07,295 --> 00:30:09,287
It's called
Comme de Sud Pacific.

467
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:12,044
I think that's French
for "Coconuts."

468
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:19,974
That's better than the gelati.

469
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:23,552
Valerie, it feels like there's
a bunch of butterflies...

470
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,059
flapping around
in my stomach right now.

471
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:27,803
Is that normal?

472
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:30,397
Sometimes, sure.

473
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,481
Good, because I was concerned.

474
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:36,318
Why did they do this to me?
I was good to them.

475
00:30:36,782 --> 00:30:38,574
I can hardly notice. Honest.

476
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,953
I sure hope Nicky's
kicking some ass on Earth...

477
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:46,365
or we are doomed.

478
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:48,542
I was the one who created Hell.

479
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:49,916
I know, Your Hatefulness.

480
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:53,084
Actually, the credit
belongs to my first wife.

481
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:55,506
She was the inspiration.

482
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:58,175
Chewbacca, take it easy,
will you?

483
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:02,422
You look like my first wife.
Only she had more hair.

484
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,015
In another startling
announcement from City Hall...

485
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,887
Mayor Randolph has,
effective immediately...

486
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:14,402
Iowered the legal drinking age
from twenty-one to ten.

487
00:31:18,032 --> 00:31:20,653
When an adult goes to Hell,
that's terrific.

488
00:31:23,245 --> 00:31:25,653
But when a child goes...

489
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:30,455
That's why I'm in this business.

490
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:33,453
Little Nicky.

491
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:35,085
-Know what's nice about you?
-What?

492
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,550
I like the way you're happy
just being yourself.

493
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:40,968
You don't try to act cool.

494
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,719
Thanks much, Valerie.

495
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:46,010
You know what's nice about you?

496
00:31:49,063 --> 00:31:52,598
Your juicy heart-shaped heinie.

497
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:54,098
What was that?

498
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:58,400
I don't know why I said that.
I meant to say that...

499
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:04,828
I've always dreamt about
having sex with a gross pig.

500
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:08,703
Can I wash my winky
in your kitchen sinky?

501
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,447
You're a real jerk!

502
00:32:10,918 --> 00:32:12,293
I didn't mean to be.

503
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:14,545
What the--Adrian!

504
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:17,080
Dad needs you
to come back to Hell.

505
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,255
So he sent old Shovel Face
to fetch me.

506
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,796
I'm not kidding.
He's in trouble.

507
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:24,010
So are you.

508
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:27,391
Hey, Valerie!

509
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:33,647
What is your problem?

510
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:35,899
I'm sorry!

511
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,739
Adrian, you froze the fire gate,
and Dad is dying...

512
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:44,655
so get your booty
back home or else!

513
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,613
You can't talk tough, Nicky.

514
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:49,831
Even the voice inside your head
has a speech impediment.

515
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:54,620
You're going back
because I'm going to make you!

516
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:56,665
How about this?
I'll stay here...

517
00:32:57,131 --> 00:33:00,298
enjoying my pizza
and my peppermint schnapps...

518
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,254
and you go back.

519
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,716
Adrian, don't!

520
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,181
Cut the crap! This is serious!

521
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:12,468
Come on!

522
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,141
I was driving to work today...

523
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,980
some bozo in a Cadillac
cuts me off.

524
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:22,443
So I followed him.

525
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:24,899
When he got out of his car,
I run up behind him...

526
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:27,407
and start bashing his brains in
with this bat.

527
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,199
Did you ever see
"The Untouchables"?

528
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:30,909
I was De Niro!

529
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:33,283
What's happened to you, Regis?

530
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:35,871
The mayor's office today...

531
00:33:36,337 --> 00:33:38,413
along with the New York
Board of Tourism...

532
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:43,342
unveiled its new motto
to replace "I Love New York."

533
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:47,053
"I Love Hookers" will now be
the city's catch phrase.

534
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:49,258
Your brothers are upsetting
the balance...

535
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:51,006
between good and evil.

536
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:52,592
What can I do about it?

537
00:33:53,062 --> 00:33:54,640
You can't do jack shit...

538
00:33:55,106 --> 00:33:56,600
unless you learn
your evil powers.

539
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:59,189
Go get a soda out of the fridge.

540
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:01,775
But those are
my roommate's sodas.

541
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:04,527
"But those are
my roommate's sodas."

542
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:08,525
Does that sound like a statement
the son of the Devil would make?

543
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:10,026
All right. Take it easy.

544
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:13,865
You have the power to change
the cola in that can...

545
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,492
into any other liquid.

546
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:20,294
Engine oil, bat's blood,
moose piss.

547
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:23,294
You just have to release
the evil within.

548
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:24,957
Release the evil?

549
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:28,179
I'm just saying
there's wickedness in you.

550
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,670
I can tell from your snores.

551
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:31,054
Really?

552
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,426
Release your evil.

553
00:34:34,645 --> 00:34:37,267
Release the evil.

554
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:43,736
Come on, you can do it.

555
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:45,739
There it is.

556
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:47,942
You got it in you.

557
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,361
What are you doing?

558
00:34:57,668 --> 00:35:01,369
I'm going to pretend I didn't
see a dog on the couch...

559
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,290
because my brain just can't
process that right now.

560
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,586
But were you about
to drink one of my Cokes?

561
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:10,758
No. I was just looking at it.

562
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:12,303
It's beautiful.

563
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:24,485
This Coke tastes like Pepsi.

564
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:34,120
You changed a Coke into a Pepsi?

565
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,703
That was
your big transformation?

566
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,162
Come on, man,
give it up a little.

567
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:40,120
It was pretty good
for my first try.

568
00:35:40,586 --> 00:35:43,836
Do you care that your brothers
are killing your father?

569
00:35:44,298 --> 00:35:45,164
Yes, I care!

570
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:48,385
And he is not going to die!

571
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:51,759
Atta-boy.

572
00:35:53,182 --> 00:35:55,507
I'm freaked out.
My television just blew up.

573
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:57,886
You're damn right it did!

574
00:35:58,354 --> 00:35:59,978
I mean, really?

575
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,397
I know this is
your living room time...

576
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:05,349
but could I finish watching
the Globetrotters out here?

577
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,026
It's the craziest game
I've ever seen.

578
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:21,667
He's walking! Get him a bus!

579
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:23,836
This is the part I don't get.

580
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:25,210
Another terrible call.

581
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:27,500
There's no way
that was travelling.

582
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,924
What's with all the calls?
We haven't lost in 53 years!

583
00:36:30,386 --> 00:36:31,631
Guess what, cornrows?

584
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:35,382
Technical foul!
You're out of here!

585
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:41,015
Why's the referee being so mean
to the Globetrotters, Daddy?

586
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,806
I've been watching these guys
play since I was your age.

587
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:47,395
It's all part of the show, baby.

588
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:50,819
That guy in the striped shirt...

589
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:53,321
snapped his fingers
like somebody I know!

590
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,088
Normally the Globetrotters
represent family entertainment.

591
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:14,131
Who gives a shit?

592
00:37:15,806 --> 00:37:17,799
These kids came here to see
the Globetrotters win!

593
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:22,265
Ten points off the Globetrotters
on account of the bigmouth!

594
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:27,519
It's all part of the show, baby!

595
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:30,357
Hit the half-time buzzer.
I'm tired.

596
00:37:30,821 --> 00:37:32,648
If the second half doesn't
get any better than this...

597
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:35,108
you can expect
a full-scale riot.

598
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:37,652
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now time...

599
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,703
for the Globetrotters' half-time
half-court heave-ho throw!

600
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,708
If the contestant makes it...

601
00:37:44,168 --> 00:37:45,793
everyone here
will get a free pizza pie!

602
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:48,412
I ain't taking the shot.
These people are crazy.

603
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:51,502
Excuse me. I'll take that shot.

604
00:37:52,843 --> 00:37:55,216
What made you want to see
the Globetrotters today, son?

605
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,135
I came for the beer
and the bitches.

606
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,225
Look who's back from the dead.

607
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:07,270
Six-six-six! Pickup sticks!

608
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,403
Please welcome Miguel Sanchez
from the Bronx, New York!

609
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:11,775
What's Nicky doing there?

610
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:13,946
Trying to capture
his brother in a flask...

611
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:16,695
and preserve the balance
of good and evil on Earth.

612
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,650
-Did you just talk?
-No.

613
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:25,372
-Are you Miguel from the Bronx?
-No. I'm Nicky from the South.

614
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:27,246
Hey, give me that!

615
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:30,161
You better win these people
some free pizza...

616
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:32,671
because it looks like they're
about to kill each other.

617
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:33,750
All right.

618
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:35,962
Who's that man, Mommy?

619
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:40,217
I don't know,
but he sure is butt-ugly.

620
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:43,470
Release the evil.

621
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:50,267
Too much evil.

622
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:54,353
I think that ball just blew up,
and, yes, my hair is aflame.

623
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:56,447
I don't know
what the Hell that was.

624
00:38:56,907 --> 00:38:59,612
-Don't do it again, huh?
-All right.

625
00:39:00,077 --> 00:39:04,573
I command you not to blow up
and go into that metal circle.

626
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,039
Get that crap out of here!

627
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:16,298
I know you're having fun,
Cassius...

628
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:18,753
but you really got
to come back to Hell.

629
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:22,970
Look around you, Nicky.
We're in Hell. The new Hell.

630
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:29,643
Do it! Do it! Do it!

631
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:34,400
I was sent here
to take you back...

632
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:35,776
and that's what I'm going to do.

633
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:38,860
Don't make me take out
the shovel again, Trick.

634
00:39:39,325 --> 00:39:42,279
I think we're about to see
a Devil showdown.

635
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:46,155
Dad got sick when you guys left.

636
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:48,118
I'm glad he's dying...

637
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:51,704
because it's my turn now.

638
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:54,873
You're going to wish
you never said that.

639
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,463
Take him to the hole, Nicky.

640
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,421
I mean, woof woof.

641
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:08,057
Come on, brother, come on!

642
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:10,229
Come on!

643
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:19,738
Daddy can't help you!

644
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:33,373
Enough!

645
00:40:35,214 --> 00:40:39,046
This show gets better
every year!

646
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,882
That was sick.
Who taught you that shit?

647
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:43,461
Sorry, Cassius.

648
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:47,051
It must be the Super Devil Juice
Dad gave me.

649
00:40:47,518 --> 00:40:49,511
Super Devil Juice?
Give me that, little girl.

650
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:51,259
Don't drink out of it, please!

651
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:04,864
Now that was some straight-up
David Copperfield shit!

652
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:07,151
Damn you, Nicky!

653
00:41:07,622 --> 00:41:09,531
There ain't no Super Devil Juice
in here!

654
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:10,745
Hail, Nicky!

655
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:14,079
We are forever your slaves!

656
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:22,582
-So your father's the Devil.
-Sí, seòor.

657
00:41:23,054 --> 00:41:26,008
You're a talking dog from Hell.
You guys are who?

658
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:29,344
A couple of big fans of Nicky
and the work his dad does.

659
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,301
By the way, Nicky,
check this out.

660
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:39,353
What's Ozzy trying to say there?

661
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,445
John, absolutely nothing.

662
00:41:41,906 --> 00:41:44,231
The Blizzard always
came straight with his messages.

663
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,034
But wrap your minds around this,
gentlemen.

664
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:53,538
Chicago.

665
00:41:57,338 --> 00:41:59,876
I love this song.

666
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,052
I command you
in the name of Lucifer...

667
00:42:04,512 --> 00:42:06,469
to spread the blood
of the innocent.

668
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:10,181
Oh, my God, Chicago kicks ass!

669
00:42:11,268 --> 00:42:12,383
That was awesome.

670
00:42:12,853 --> 00:42:17,266
You know, guys,
this cake tastes a little funny.

671
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:20,355
I dumped a fat sack of reefer
in the mix.

672
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,729
Thought I'd spice up the bash.

673
00:42:23,197 --> 00:42:25,024
-Really?
-What's reefer?

674
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:27,697
About five hundred bucks
an ounce.

675
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:43,542
Come on, Nicky, one more time.

676
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,718
I can't. It's starting to hurt.

677
00:42:46,178 --> 00:42:48,301
Come on, you totally got to!

678
00:42:48,764 --> 00:42:50,923
All right, all right. Last time.

679
00:42:51,392 --> 00:42:52,934
Here he goes!

680
00:42:59,317 --> 00:43:00,479
That's insane!

681
00:43:00,943 --> 00:43:03,980
How do you do that?

682
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:07,949
I used to get messed up
like this...

683
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:10,117
with my first girlfriend
Heather.

684
00:43:10,578 --> 00:43:14,872
We'd get so loopy,
she would forget I was a dog.

685
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:18,168
-She was a human?
-No. A sewer rat.

686
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:21,787
Man, that pissed my parents off.

687
00:43:22,256 --> 00:43:24,628
You know, I was in love once...

688
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:26,717
but she said I wasn't
financially reliable...

689
00:43:27,178 --> 00:43:28,340
and she needed that.

690
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:30,548
By "she," do you mean "he"?

691
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:33,221
-No.
-Busted!

692
00:43:34,852 --> 00:43:35,801
Please.

693
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:41,016
How you feeling over there,
Satan Abdul-Jabbar?

694
00:43:41,484 --> 00:43:43,192
A little strange.

695
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:47,022
I can't stop thinking
about this girl Valerie.

696
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,948
Why? Did she hurt you?

697
00:43:49,408 --> 00:43:51,200
Do you need to cry
on my shoulder?

698
00:43:51,661 --> 00:43:52,775
Easy, Liberace.

699
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:54,953
Would you grow up?

700
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:56,909
Liberace.

701
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,785
I was having the best day
with her...

702
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:02,834
until Adrian made me tell her
she had a heart-shaped heinie.

703
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:05,254
Maybe you love her.
But what do I know?

704
00:44:05,716 --> 00:44:08,005
I can't even see straight.

705
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,670
Me, too! We got to get going.

706
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,714
You guys can crash here.
I have an extra futon.

707
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:18,427
That's a big pass, Elton John.

708
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:22,430
Ozzy starts in 30 minutes.
That'll cheer you up, Nicky.

709
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,931
Yeah, let's roll.

710
00:44:24,402 --> 00:44:28,102
I can't give the Ozz man
the full focus he deserves.

711
00:44:28,572 --> 00:44:29,486
Sorry, fellas.

712
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:33,069
This chick must be
the real deal, then.

713
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:35,493
-Later, bro.
-Good-bye, John.

714
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:37,283
-Good luck, Nicky.
-OK, Pete.

715
00:44:37,748 --> 00:44:40,370
You better snap out
of it soon, kid...

716
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:42,911
because we're going
after Adrian tomorrow...

717
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:45,621
bright and early.
Night-night.

718
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,673
Yeah, I know.
Get some sleep thing, Mr Beefy.

719
00:45:01,397 --> 00:45:05,181
That is the most horrifying
thing I have ever seen.

720
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:12,940
Go to her.

721
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:23,835
All right.

722
00:45:26,672 --> 00:45:29,128
I smell coconuts.

723
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,214
Coconuts.

724
00:45:47,735 --> 00:45:49,811
That dude looks like a lady.

725
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:51,275
You want to come in?

726
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:54,693
Actually, I'm looking
for a girl named Valerie.

727
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:57,615
Valerie Veran?
Two floors up, one window over.

728
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:58,825
Thanks much.

729
00:45:59,288 --> 00:46:00,948
Good luck
with the nipple rubbing.

730
00:46:01,415 --> 00:46:04,784
I don't need luck. I'm good.

731
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:07,245
I can see that.

732
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:33,487
Oh, my God!
Nicky, is that you?

733
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:36,024
Stay right there.

734
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:38,117
I will.

735
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:50,246
What were you thinking
coming here?

736
00:46:50,715 --> 00:46:53,834
I don't know, but it didn't
involve going blind.

737
00:46:55,761 --> 00:46:56,876
Oh, my God! Nicky!

738
00:46:57,346 --> 00:46:59,220
Please don't die!

739
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:05,638
What are you doing?

740
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:09,311
I think I'm floating.

741
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:12,266
Why would you be floating?

742
00:47:12,737 --> 00:47:16,022
Maybe it was because
of this cake I ate earlier.

743
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,863
Am I supposed to not be
freaked out right now?

744
00:47:19,327 --> 00:47:20,073
Because I am.

745
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:21,651
I'm freaked out, too.

746
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:24,742
The butterflies in my stomach
are flapping around...

747
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:27,877
in a way I've never felt before.

748
00:47:28,336 --> 00:47:30,245
You got the wrong window again,
man.

749
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:32,421
Oh, sorry, Nipples. Valerie!

750
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:35,088
-Nicky, over here.
-I'm coming.

751
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:36,880
Oh, my God, you made it.

752
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:40,963
Valerie, I can see again,
and you look beautiful.

753
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:44,385
Just because you're floating...

754
00:47:44,852 --> 00:47:46,809
doesn't mean I'm going to forget
you giving me the finger.

755
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:48,386
That wasn't me.

756
00:47:48,856 --> 00:47:51,014
I was being possessed
by my brother Adrian.

757
00:47:51,484 --> 00:47:52,563
What do you mean, possessed?

758
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:55,814
Remember when I told you
that my father was in Hell?

759
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,067
That's because he's the Devil...

760
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:02,902
and he wants to keep his throne
for another 10,000 years.

761
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:04,865
And that pissed off
my brothers...

762
00:48:05,331 --> 00:48:06,742
so they broke
the gates of Hell...

763
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:10,908
which is making my father
decompose.

764
00:48:11,379 --> 00:48:15,708
I love my father very much,
so I came to Earth to save him.

765
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:19,127
Now I get that Deep South joke.

766
00:48:23,015 --> 00:48:25,637
I don't know
if I should believe you.

767
00:48:26,102 --> 00:48:28,094
You got to believe.
Believe in the butterflies.

768
00:48:28,562 --> 00:48:30,935
Wait. OK. OK, OK, I believe.

769
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:34,186
Come on. Come back up.

770
00:48:36,028 --> 00:48:38,602
Take my hand, Valerie.

771
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:44,403
Fly with me.
I can give you the power.

772
00:48:52,044 --> 00:48:54,167
That's
the Empire State Building.

773
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,833
There's Popeye's chicken--
right there.

774
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:01,467
The Hell Beast is above us...

775
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:04,847
and I can smell an evil slut.

776
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:07,803
Whoa, Devil!

777
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:09,134
Did you do that?

778
00:49:09,604 --> 00:49:12,273
Nobody calls my girl
an evil slut.

779
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:15,229
Good morning, New York.

780
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:17,021
This is an "Action News"
special report.

781
00:49:17,486 --> 00:49:18,482
A shocking crime...

782
00:49:18,946 --> 00:49:21,354
results in a record
fifty-million-dollar reward...

783
00:49:21,824 --> 00:49:23,283
for the capture of this man.

784
00:49:23,743 --> 00:49:24,857
His name is unknown...

785
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:27,569
but his actions have earned him
the label "The Monster."

786
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,494
He should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

787
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,452
The man who caused
such a sensation...

788
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:35,326
at the game yesterday
is no hero.

789
00:49:35,796 --> 00:49:38,204
He is, in fact, a mass murderer.

790
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:40,881
-This is real bad.
-Where the heck is Nicky?

791
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,375
I have authorized a reward...

792
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:44,802
to the person
who brings this man to me.

793
00:49:45,264 --> 00:49:47,091
It's a setup.

794
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:51,511
Good morning, young lady.

795
00:49:54,398 --> 00:49:56,605
That looks like it tastes great.

796
00:49:59,362 --> 00:49:59,978
Look at that.

797
00:50:00,446 --> 00:50:02,355
Mr Beefy would like you.

798
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:05,193
Oh, look.

799
00:50:47,618 --> 00:50:48,649
There he is!

800
00:51:31,203 --> 00:51:32,746
Wait. Wait.

801
00:51:33,205 --> 00:51:34,368
What is happening?

802
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:38,454
There he is!

803
00:51:41,213 --> 00:51:43,123
I'm not a monster.

804
00:51:48,763 --> 00:51:52,013
Release the evil.

805
00:52:22,546 --> 00:52:24,872
Beefy, I think I'm in trouble.

806
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,752
The shit has hit the fan, kid.

807
00:52:27,218 --> 00:52:28,083
Take a look.

808
00:52:28,552 --> 00:52:29,881
This videotape
will show what he did...

809
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:31,888
after he left the game.

810
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:34,924
Say hello to my little friend.

811
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:38,895
My name is Nicky...

812
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:41,644
and I'm going to kill all
you suckers for no reason.

813
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:45,227
That's not me! That's
that cockroach Tony Montana!

814
00:52:46,404 --> 00:52:48,776
-Difficult to watch, I know.
-This is Adrian's work.

815
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,573
He superimposed your head
onto "Scarface."

816
00:52:53,035 --> 00:52:55,324
Which is probably DePalma's
third best film.

817
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:58,530
I'm not Nicky.

818
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,909
Dude, it's us. Let us in.

819
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:03,619
-John! Pete!
-Nicky!

820
00:53:04,088 --> 00:53:05,796
There's a total mob scene
coming this way.

821
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:08,830
It looks like they're following
a giant trail of bug shit.

822
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:10,416
What do we do now, Beefy?

823
00:53:10,886 --> 00:53:12,546
I don't know. This is
a little out of my league.

824
00:53:13,014 --> 00:53:15,552
-What would your dad do, Nicky?
-That's a great idea!

825
00:53:16,017 --> 00:53:17,475
I'll ask him. Kill me.

826
00:53:17,935 --> 00:53:18,884
Are you serious?

827
00:53:19,353 --> 00:53:22,473
Yes. We'll meet
at Grand Central Station, noon.

828
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,684
Now I command you--do me.

829
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:26,147
All right!

830
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,068
That just hurt a lot.

831
00:53:33,534 --> 00:53:34,483
Still alive, though.

832
00:53:34,952 --> 00:53:36,826
I've always wanted
to kill someone.

833
00:53:37,288 --> 00:53:38,996
Can I give it a try?

834
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:45,419
Damn you, Kevin Spacey!

835
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,000
You take all my parts!

836
00:53:50,468 --> 00:53:52,259
Hey, you lose--royal flush.

837
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,633
Off with the brassiere.

838
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:57,216
The last time I saw
a pair of jugs that big...

839
00:53:57,683 --> 00:53:59,427
two hillbillies
were blowing on them.

840
00:54:04,732 --> 00:54:06,890
Oh, my God, Dad.

841
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,064
Nicky, I got no legs.

842
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:11,728
I got no hips.

843
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:13,657
I got one ear.

844
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:14,946
I got no ears.

845
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:17,449
Now he has no ears.
Are you happy, Nicky?

846
00:54:17,912 --> 00:54:20,118
Adrian's got the whole city
following me.

847
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:21,862
I can't hear you, Nicky!

848
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,744
Check one, two. Check one, two.

849
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,123
Put it back on my head!

850
00:54:25,586 --> 00:54:28,124
You got until midnight tonight.

851
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:32,088
Get your ass back up there,
and save your father. Go!

852
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:34,758
-I'm going to save you, Dad.
-Go, go, go!

853
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:37,463
-I'm going to save you!
-Go, then! Move it!

854
00:54:37,932 --> 00:54:39,177
Go, Nicky, go!

855
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:40,840
Sure you're down with this?

856
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,350
A little nervous. Want to puke.

857
00:54:44,355 --> 00:54:47,391
Hey, hey, fuzz.
We know where to find Nicky.

858
00:54:52,196 --> 00:54:53,821
-Let's go.
-Get in.

859
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:55,445
What's up, Police Chief?

860
00:54:55,908 --> 00:54:58,316
-You have what I want.
-You got what we want?

861
00:54:58,786 --> 00:55:00,779
Fifty million bones, bro.

862
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:02,871
-Here's the money.
-Whoa, my God!

863
00:55:03,332 --> 00:55:05,408
That's half of it. You get
the rest when I get Nicky.

864
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:07,075
Thanks much.

865
00:55:07,545 --> 00:55:09,952
I got to warn you, man.
He's kind of not human.

866
00:55:10,423 --> 00:55:13,092
-Really?
-He might be the son of Satan.

867
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,723
I guess I'll have to be
extra careful, then, aren't l?

868
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:26,144
Now, where is he?

869
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,148
Hey, come on, that was cool!

870
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:30,771
Do it again!

871
00:55:36,157 --> 00:55:37,734
Out of the way!

872
00:55:42,246 --> 00:55:44,120
Where is he? He's late.

873
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:46,574
He'll be here.
Just keep your skirt on.

874
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:48,288
That's where he comes out of.

875
00:55:48,753 --> 00:55:50,128
Over there!

876
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:52,626
We've been ratted out.

877
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:56,044
We thought the son of Satan
would understand such a move.

878
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,132
-Get these two out of here.
-All right, this way.

879
00:56:00,973 --> 00:56:03,429
What is this?
A bulldog and his gay lover?

880
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:04,723
Oh, shut up.

881
00:56:05,186 --> 00:56:06,977
It's true. It's true.

882
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:08,303
Judas.

883
00:56:08,773 --> 00:56:10,730
Judas Priest, maybe.

884
00:56:11,192 --> 00:56:13,683
I'm only an actor.
I don't know what's happening.

885
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:16,311
Take him to the holding area.
Seal off all the exits.

886
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:19,272
I'm only an actor!

887
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,357
You want to see something cool?

888
00:56:22,828 --> 00:56:24,157
Definitely.

889
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:36,380
Pick me a winner.

890
00:56:37,468 --> 00:56:38,843
Oh, sick!

891
00:56:39,303 --> 00:56:41,841
Oh, my God, that was awesome!

892
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,804
So, what time's
my brother expected back?

893
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:51,307
Noon. Ish.

894
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:53,601
Even though you're
not really the chief...

895
00:56:54,068 --> 00:56:55,693
we still get the rest
of the cash, right, bro?

896
00:56:56,153 --> 00:56:57,529
You know what you'll get, boys?

897
00:56:57,989 --> 00:56:59,732
An indescribably
horrific torture...

898
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:03,485
administered by demons
for the rest of eternity.

899
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,495
And we get to keep the cash,
too, right?

900
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,034
Sure.

901
00:57:07,498 --> 00:57:08,826
Why not?

902
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,999
You're hurting me.

903
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,623
Shut up.

904
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,802
Applesauce every time.

905
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:27,132
Hey, boys!

906
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:29,760
You want a blizzard
with my flip-flop?

907
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:33,183
No, thanks, but we'll take
that bottle of booze.

908
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,859
Beat it, you freak.
Get out of here.

909
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,691
I'll be back with my flip-flop!

910
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,190
Schnapps.

911
00:57:47,455 --> 00:57:48,486
Peppermint?

912
00:57:48,956 --> 00:57:50,534
All right!

913
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,290
Want a hit?

914
00:57:54,754 --> 00:57:58,039
Drink up.
Here's to fifty million clams.

915
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:01,212
To the defilement of Earth
and corruption of its people.

916
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:03,670
OK, whatever.
Just drink it.

917
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:05,169
Cheers.

918
00:58:15,316 --> 00:58:17,854
It's awfully hot down here.

919
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,186
How do you manage
to stay so cool?

920
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,691
Beer lowers
the body temperature.

921
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:30,945
I read that in a beer magazine.

922
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:35,120
This liquid
will probably quench my thirst.

923
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:38,414
-Cool me off.
-Definitely.

924
00:58:38,881 --> 00:58:41,206
Give you a pretty good buzz.

925
00:58:45,304 --> 00:58:48,638
Or maybe it will trap me inside
for all of eternity.

926
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,769
No, it won't?

927
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:55,893
Oh, Nicky.
I've missed you.

928
00:58:56,357 --> 00:58:58,231
Come out and say hello!

929
00:58:58,693 --> 00:59:00,151
I'm not Nicky.

930
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:02,687
I'm calling you out, brother!

931
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:09,485
Adrian, this is very painful.

932
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,834
-There you are.
-I told you he was sick.

933
00:59:27,305 --> 00:59:28,467
Oh, hello, Cassius.

934
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:30,390
All right, Adrian! Let me out!

935
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,804
New Hell really only needs
one new Satan.

936
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,681
You motherfu--

937
00:59:36,147 --> 00:59:39,266
But Cassius could use
some company for eternity.

938
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:41,480
So get in the flask.

939
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:43,142
Kick his ass, Nicky.

940
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,359
Sleep.

941
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:46,233
You got it.

942
00:59:50,745 --> 00:59:53,414
Hey, hold up.
Someone's got to take a pee.

943
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:59,116
That dog's got smoke balls!

944
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,547
Run, Beefy! Run!

945
01:00:05,009 --> 01:00:06,633
You can't make me drink, Adrian.

946
01:00:07,094 --> 01:00:08,174
Of course I can.

947
01:00:12,892 --> 01:00:15,679
Oh, it's Nicky's
little ragamuffin.

948
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,390
Drink or she dies.

949
01:00:17,855 --> 01:00:20,311
Unlike you, she won't come back
from where she's going.

950
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:26,071
Let go of her!
This is between you and me!

951
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:30,030
I hear a train a-coming!

952
01:00:31,535 --> 01:00:33,113
Adrian, stop!

953
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:36,284
-Drink!
-All right! Don't hurt her!

954
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:38,371
Don't do it, Nicky!

955
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:40,661
I have to, Valerie.

956
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,553
Now, that hurt the both of us.

957
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:10,444
See you in Hell!

958
01:01:15,997 --> 01:01:18,832
Hey, look at the bright side.
You can go for a swim.

959
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:22,084
You can play the harmonica,
and you can choke someone.

960
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,621
Take me to my room.
I want to be alone!

961
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:26,998
In your weakened condition,
if you vacate the throne...

962
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:30,136
any of your sons can claim
the seat of power for their own.

963
01:01:30,594 --> 01:01:32,338
Horseshit.

964
01:01:32,805 --> 01:01:34,548
Hey, good news.
Adrian's back.

965
01:01:35,016 --> 01:01:36,344
I'm going to be all right?

966
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:39,010
Where's Nicky?

967
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:40,937
He came with you and Cassius,
right?

968
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,891
I came through that gate alone.

969
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:44,935
Sorry, sir. False alarm.

970
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,985
Would everyone stop
playing with me...

971
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:50,688
and tell me
what my brother's up to?

972
01:02:11,052 --> 01:02:12,878
What is this?

973
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,848
Is it Dad's birthday?

974
01:02:36,327 --> 01:02:37,406
There he is.

975
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,697
Hi! I can't believe you're here!

976
01:02:40,164 --> 01:02:40,994
Welcome.

977
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:42,999
Up with the sign.

978
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,537
Can I just tell you
I am so excited right now?

979
01:02:48,005 --> 01:02:50,294
-So excited!
-She really is.

980
01:02:50,758 --> 01:02:52,300
If you could point me
to the Black Palace...

981
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,251
I really got to check in
with my dad.

982
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:59,929
Can I ask you something?

983
01:03:00,393 --> 01:03:01,935
What do you know about your mom?

984
01:03:02,395 --> 01:03:03,675
My mom.

985
01:03:04,146 --> 01:03:07,432
My brothers tell me
that she was a mountain goat...

986
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,225
which would explain
my chronic halitosis.

987
01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:12,652
A mountain goat?
That's really sweet.

988
01:03:13,114 --> 01:03:14,228
Jenna, chair.

989
01:03:16,158 --> 01:03:17,321
Thanks.

990
01:03:18,786 --> 01:03:20,494
My mother wasn't a goat?

991
01:03:20,955 --> 01:03:22,829
Try an angel.

992
01:03:23,291 --> 01:03:26,541
An angel?

993
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:28,248
I'm your mom.

994
01:03:31,299 --> 01:03:35,759
If you're my mom,
then how come you're not older?

995
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,177
Angels don't get any older, son.

996
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:41,391
I can't believe
you just called him "son."

997
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,176
This is so wild!

998
01:03:48,816 --> 01:03:51,817
Jenna, Christa.
Time for your mambo lesson.

999
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:54,733
Chubbs, I'm so sorry.
I totally spaced.

1000
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:57,107
I have company.
This is my son Nicky.

1001
01:03:59,493 --> 01:04:00,691
Chubbs used to be a golf pro...

1002
01:04:01,162 --> 01:04:02,953
but up here he's just
the dopest dance instructor.

1003
01:04:03,414 --> 01:04:04,244
Ah, that's nice.

1004
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:05,703
You mambo?

1005
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:07,116
I don't think so.

1006
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:10,337
It's all in the hips.

1007
01:04:12,673 --> 01:04:14,880
-Bye, Chubbs.
-All in the hips, yeah!

1008
01:04:15,343 --> 01:04:16,837
Nobody in this room
will tell you a thing, Adrian.

1009
01:04:17,303 --> 01:04:18,382
Right!

1010
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,593
Hey, let him go!

1011
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:25,640
Perhaps a titty-twister
will loosen your lips.

1012
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:28,262
I'm getting turned on.

1013
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,056
All I know is that if you
sit on that throne...

1014
01:04:31,525 --> 01:04:33,185
in your father's
weakened condition--

1015
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:34,352
Tit-head, no!

1016
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:38,189
You can claim the seat of power
for your own.

1017
01:04:40,034 --> 01:04:41,030
Really?

1018
01:04:41,494 --> 01:04:42,822
As the founder of Hell...

1019
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:45,363
I command you
to stay off that throne!

1020
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:49,123
Even in Hell I get no respect.

1021
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,542
Put me down!

1022
01:05:14,902 --> 01:05:16,859
So where did you meet Dad?

1023
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:20,406
It was a long time ago
at this Heaven-Hell mixer.

1024
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:23,404
I remember that night.
You had, like, four daiquiris.

1025
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:24,735
At first
I didn't really like him.

1026
01:05:25,204 --> 01:05:27,612
-He was really conceited.
-But he was funny.

1027
01:05:28,082 --> 01:05:30,999
And I hate to admit it,
but he had a really hot body.

1028
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,587
Puppy phone.

1029
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:37,040
It's so cute.

1030
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:39,750
Hi, Michelle.
Yeah, he's here right now.

1031
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:42,544
I don't know if he's hot.
He's my son, you perv.

1032
01:05:43,014 --> 01:05:44,259
Can I call you back?

1033
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:47,933
That was my friend Michelle.
She says hi.

1034
01:05:48,394 --> 01:05:49,769
Say hi back.

1035
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:51,804
I'll just call her later.

1036
01:05:52,273 --> 01:05:54,846
We totally saw you
save your girlfriend's life.

1037
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:55,934
That was so cool.

1038
01:05:56,402 --> 01:05:58,229
That's why you came to Heaven
instead of Hell.

1039
01:05:58,696 --> 01:06:00,356
Self-sacrifice
automatically gets you here.

1040
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:01,854
How did you see me?

1041
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:05,242
We can see anything
that's going on on Earth. Look.

1042
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:07,693
Someone else is taking
the internship.

1043
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,406
That's "Felicity."
I love that show. Do you watch?

1044
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:13,164
I haven't seen it,
but I hear good things.

1045
01:06:15,379 --> 01:06:17,253
This is an "Action News"
special report.

1046
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:20,835
Moments ago, a large chunk
of what appears to be Hell...

1047
01:06:21,302 --> 01:06:23,674
began to rise
from beneath Central Park.

1048
01:06:24,138 --> 01:06:25,881
Far from being terrified...

1049
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,341
many New Yorkers have begun
flocking to the site...

1050
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:31,431
turning it into an unofficial
party central.

1051
01:06:31,896 --> 01:06:33,224
And this just in...

1052
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:37,189
I'm cheating on my husband
with the weatherman.

1053
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,606
Show him Central Park.

1054
01:06:41,072 --> 01:06:42,447
I love your legs.

1055
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:03,507
That's my father's throne!

1056
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,843
-Is Dad OK?
-Let's see.

1057
01:07:06,305 --> 01:07:08,262
I was a good Devil, wasn't l?

1058
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:10,883
You were the best Devil, sir!

1059
01:07:11,352 --> 01:07:13,843
If we fall in there,
we will die. Period.

1060
01:07:14,313 --> 01:07:17,065
My underwear is so far up my ass
I could taste it.

1061
01:07:17,525 --> 01:07:18,355
I hear that.

1062
01:07:18,818 --> 01:07:22,021
Welcome to the party!

1063
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:27,819
It's so nice
to see you all here.

1064
01:07:28,286 --> 01:07:30,527
I'm so proud of you.

1065
01:07:30,997 --> 01:07:34,745
You've taken to sin
with such minimal prompting.

1066
01:07:37,712 --> 01:07:40,997
You're acting as if
there is no Heaven or Hell.

1067
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:47,087
Well, I've got news for you.

1068
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:54,300
There is most definitely a Hell.

1069
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:55,552
What?

1070
01:07:56,022 --> 01:07:59,141
And you're all
going there when you die.

1071
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:02,859
Which is in about
fifteen minutes.

1072
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:06,156
Holy shit,
we really are going to die!

1073
01:08:13,205 --> 01:08:15,198
I'm really burning now!

1074
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:17,244
What are we going to do?

1075
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,169
I got to help her.

1076
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,336
I got to help Dad.

1077
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,541
I got to help everybody.

1078
01:08:24,008 --> 01:08:24,957
At the stroke of midnight...

1079
01:08:25,426 --> 01:08:28,131
my father will be
completely deteriorated...

1080
01:08:28,596 --> 01:08:31,763
and all your souls will be mine.

1081
01:08:32,224 --> 01:08:33,553
Soon you will see things...

1082
01:08:34,018 --> 01:08:36,094
more horrible
than you can even imagine.

1083
01:08:39,065 --> 01:08:42,813
Well, maybe not that horrible,
but still pretty bad.

1084
01:08:44,236 --> 01:08:45,612
So, while we wait...

1085
01:08:46,072 --> 01:08:47,400
for your enjoyment...

1086
01:08:47,865 --> 01:08:49,988
I bring you a dear, sweet man--

1087
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:52,989
Mr Henry Winkler.

1088
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,112
Good evening.

1089
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:57,289
Covered in bees!

1090
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,755
How can I win?

1091
01:09:04,215 --> 01:09:07,251
Adrian is stronger
and smarter than me.

1092
01:09:07,718 --> 01:09:08,465
Stronger, yes.

1093
01:09:08,928 --> 01:09:10,552
Smarter, definitely.

1094
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:12,887
But you have something
that he doesn't have.

1095
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,591
A speech impediment?

1096
01:09:17,103 --> 01:09:18,478
The inner light, honey.

1097
01:09:18,938 --> 01:09:20,313
And you can totally use it.

1098
01:09:20,773 --> 01:09:23,346
-It's the best power of all.
-I do?

1099
01:09:23,818 --> 01:09:26,772
And God told me if you
get in really bad trouble...

1100
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:28,613
you can use this.

1101
01:09:29,073 --> 01:09:30,781
What is it?

1102
01:09:31,242 --> 01:09:32,784
I'm not totally
a hundred percent on that...

1103
01:09:33,244 --> 01:09:35,913
but God said when the time came,
you'd know what to do with it.

1104
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:37,237
God's so smart.

1105
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:39,331
Like "Jeopardy!" smart.

1106
01:09:42,753 --> 01:09:43,535
My little boy.

1107
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:46,674
Mommy,
get me to the Big Apple...

1108
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:50,299
because I'm going to
rock that town like a hurricane.

1109
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:52,090
You're already there.

1110
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:53,551
Bye, Nicky.

1111
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:55,425
Bye, Mom.

1112
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,350
Bye, guys.

1113
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,563
Release the good.

1114
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:22,539
Yes, they're furry.

1115
01:10:23,002 --> 01:10:24,829
Bunny, bunny, bunny!

1116
01:10:25,296 --> 01:10:27,454
Release the awesome.

1117
01:10:31,218 --> 01:10:33,674
What you do is put it
in your mouth...

1118
01:10:34,138 --> 01:10:38,266
and let the meat slide down
your throat hole.

1119
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,681
Not you, not you!

1120
01:10:45,775 --> 01:10:48,692
Popeye's chicken
is the shizzney!

1121
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,504
You know, from this angle,
you're kind of cute.

1122
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,166
You think so?

1123
01:11:15,054 --> 01:11:16,003
Oh, my God.

1124
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:18,714
He just opened his mouth
and swallowed that spit.

1125
01:11:19,183 --> 01:11:22,018
That turn you on there, RuPaul?

1126
01:11:28,442 --> 01:11:30,518
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1127
01:11:31,612 --> 01:11:33,272
Little Nicky.

1128
01:11:35,283 --> 01:11:36,362
I knew you would make it!

1129
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:40,159
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely.

1130
01:11:40,621 --> 01:11:42,910
Let my friends alone...

1131
01:11:43,374 --> 01:11:45,367
and get in the flask.

1132
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:46,617
Is this a joke?

1133
01:11:47,086 --> 01:11:48,711
No, it's the inner light...

1134
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,876
and with it,
we can defeat whatever you got.

1135
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,586
It's true!

1136
01:11:57,471 --> 01:11:59,014
It's not true!

1137
01:12:01,225 --> 01:12:03,597
Run, traitors, run!

1138
01:12:04,061 --> 01:12:05,390
OK, Adrian.

1139
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:08,606
You've left me no choice.

1140
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,413
Leave this to me.

1141
01:12:24,665 --> 01:12:26,574
Let's see what you've got.

1142
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,499
Enough!

1143
01:13:16,342 --> 01:13:17,801
I'm going to kill you
with my bare hands.

1144
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,541
I'm ready for you.

1145
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:22,548
I guess I wasn't ready.

1146
01:13:36,362 --> 01:13:38,355
-I totally had to do that.
-Hell, yeah!

1147
01:13:38,823 --> 01:13:39,736
-Good job!
-That's great!

1148
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:41,610
Thanks, Mom !

1149
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,913
I'm going to ask you nicely.

1150
01:13:51,377 --> 01:13:53,286
Get in the fla--

1151
01:13:53,754 --> 01:13:56,541
You want a pillow fight, do you?

1152
01:13:57,008 --> 01:13:59,499
Let's let the feathers fly.

1153
01:14:01,053 --> 01:14:02,298
Come on, now.

1154
01:14:05,683 --> 01:14:06,963
Come on.

1155
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,934
I'm right here.
Where am I going with it, baby?

1156
01:14:12,398 --> 01:14:13,429
Here I am.

1157
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:18,309
I'm sleeping.

1158
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:19,942
Or am l?

1159
01:14:24,118 --> 01:14:24,948
Thanks, Mr Winkler.

1160
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:27,700
I'm asking you one last time.

1161
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:30,203
Get in the flask.

1162
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,540
A little help here, please.

1163
01:14:35,212 --> 01:14:35,793
Please!

1164
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:38,877
Don't do this! No!

1165
01:14:45,056 --> 01:14:46,301
Good-bye, Nicky.

1166
01:14:56,108 --> 01:14:57,389
Nice to see you, brothers.

1167
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,651
Now I'm going to bust
both of your heads wide open!

1168
01:15:06,744 --> 01:15:08,404
-Come on!
-Get 'em, Nicky!

1169
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:09,867
Come on, Nicky!

1170
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:14,198
You can do it, Nicky!
Kick him in his hairy balls!

1171
01:15:14,669 --> 01:15:16,127
Good idea.

1172
01:15:18,422 --> 01:15:19,537
One down, one to go, Adrian.

1173
01:15:20,007 --> 01:15:21,916
You've asked for this.
Time for the shovel!

1174
01:15:22,385 --> 01:15:24,258
Bring it on!

1175
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,879
-Kill him, Adrian!
-Shut up!

1176
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:29,305
-Get him, Nicky!
-Let go of me!

1177
01:16:01,257 --> 01:16:04,293
How did a nice Southern boy
learn to fight like that?

1178
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,761
I guess from my father's side
of the family.

1179
01:16:23,446 --> 01:16:26,779
What? No tongue?

1180
01:16:34,707 --> 01:16:35,987
Catch me if you can!

1181
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:37,621
That is wicked!

1182
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:46,084
Not long now!

1183
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:49,879
You got to fly out.

1184
01:16:50,348 --> 01:16:51,723
Soon it will all be mine!

1185
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:54,056
Nicky! I know you can do it.

1186
01:16:54,518 --> 01:16:55,514
Run, run!

1187
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,354
Do it for the butterflies.

1188
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:59,438
Butterflies?

1189
01:17:04,362 --> 01:17:07,481
The power of good
lets you fly out.

1190
01:17:07,949 --> 01:17:09,407
Well, you're too late, Nicky!

1191
01:17:11,285 --> 01:17:14,203
Behold your new Satan!

1192
01:17:15,373 --> 01:17:17,911
What's that?
What's with the ball?

1193
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:25,128
-Ozzy?
-Holy shit.

1194
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:28,797
No, no, no!

1195
01:17:29,261 --> 01:17:30,672
You can do it, Ozzy!

1196
01:17:31,138 --> 01:17:33,261
Bite his fricking head off!

1197
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:37,633
Spit him in the flask!

1198
01:17:38,104 --> 01:17:39,135
Here you go, Ozzy.

1199
01:17:44,652 --> 01:17:47,190
-Grand Central, Nicky!
-Start running.

1200
01:17:47,655 --> 01:17:48,900
-You'll never make it.
-You've got to die.

1201
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:50,480
I'll just go to Heaven.

1202
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:53,488
Not if you do something bad
right before you die.

1203
01:17:53,953 --> 01:17:54,818
You're right.

1204
01:17:55,288 --> 01:17:57,079
Hey, Nicky!
Cover Winkler in bees!

1205
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,738
You can do it!

1206
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:01,994
Sorry, Henry.

1207
01:18:04,255 --> 01:18:05,832
-Do me!
-With what?

1208
01:18:06,299 --> 01:18:07,247
I don't know.

1209
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:09,923
Here. Kill him with this.

1210
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:12,965
I'll never forget you, guys.

1211
01:18:13,431 --> 01:18:16,965
And we will never forget you,
my friend.

1212
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:25,064
I love you.

1213
01:18:25,526 --> 01:18:27,982
And I love you, Nicky.

1214
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:39,698
I got them, Dad! I did it!

1215
01:18:42,376 --> 01:18:45,294
Unholiness, you're back!

1216
01:18:46,505 --> 01:18:47,881
You look great!

1217
01:18:48,341 --> 01:18:49,835
It's all in the hips

1218
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:52,258
It's in the hips

1219
01:18:55,222 --> 01:18:56,421
You're all right!

1220
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:58,089
You came through, Nicky.

1221
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,101
I came through for you, Dad...

1222
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:04,060
and I came through
for Mom and the butterflies.

1223
01:19:04,523 --> 01:19:06,315
You're back in Hell now, kid.

1224
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:08,353
There are no butterflies here.

1225
01:19:08,819 --> 01:19:11,393
If you want butterflies,
you need to be on Earth.

1226
01:19:11,864 --> 01:19:17,737
What about you and Grandpa
and everybody in Hell?

1227
01:19:18,204 --> 01:19:21,822
I let my butterflies die
once upon a time...

1228
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,331
and it's never stopped hurting.

1229
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:25,873
That's right!

1230
01:19:26,337 --> 01:19:27,665
You heard me, Holly.

1231
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:28,912
What?

1232
01:19:29,382 --> 01:19:30,792
I'm still in love with you!

1233
01:19:31,258 --> 01:19:32,918
Oh, my God,
he's talking about me.

1234
01:19:33,386 --> 01:19:36,340
And don't think I forgot
about how crazy you get...

1235
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:38,882
after a few daiquiris.

1236
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,230
That guy is still
the biggest horndog.

1237
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:45,969
Yeah, he is.

1238
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:49,392
Listen, I got down low.

1239
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,696
Your mom's got up high.

1240
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,566
You take care of the middle.

1241
01:19:55,032 --> 01:19:56,824
OK, Dad.

1242
01:19:57,285 --> 01:20:01,365
But, in the words
of Motley Crue...

1243
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:05,663
this will always be
my home sweet home.

1244
01:20:06,127 --> 01:20:07,751
Don't be afraid
to show your face.

1245
01:20:08,212 --> 01:20:10,252
You're such a handsome boy.

1246
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:14,675
I hate to interrupt...

1247
01:20:15,136 --> 01:20:17,508
but it's time
for Hitler's punishment.

1248
01:20:17,972 --> 01:20:19,799
-I'll take that.
-Maybe they'll let us out.

1249
01:20:20,266 --> 01:20:21,096
Grandpa!

1250
01:20:21,559 --> 01:20:22,757
OK, kids.

1251
01:20:23,227 --> 01:20:24,852
Enjoy your new home!

1252
01:20:26,814 --> 01:20:29,519
Holy shnit!

1253
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:40,823
Such a little angel.

1254
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:43,319
Only a quarter, ma'am.

1255
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,617
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

1256
01:20:48,461 --> 01:20:49,789
Sorry.
