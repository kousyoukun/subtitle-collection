2
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,900
Let me show you
what I made today.

3
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,270
I can't wait.

4
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,400
I need to go upstairs
and change...

5
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,570
and then I'll start dinner.

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,800
Oh, yes, it's ladies night,
and the feel--

7
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,730
Showtime.

8
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,390
Rough day at the office,
Mrs Dunleavy?

9
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,610
You'll feel better once you
get out of those work clothes.

10
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,360
And into some sweats.

11
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,570
I wish you'd let me
rub those feet.

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,450
Of course,
I wouldn't use my hands.

13
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,960
I think Victoria
just told me her secret.

14
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,190
Deedly dee.
Are those things for me?

15
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,440
Mom, coming in.

16
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,400
Scottie Dunleavy?

17
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,110
What unfortunate timing.

18
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,710
Get out. Don't you know
this is naughty time?

19
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,330
I'll get it.

20
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,080
Hello, Scottie. Why don't you
be a good little boy...

21
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,220
go downstairs
and let your mother get comfy?

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,760
Who is this?

23
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,760
This is a big bird who wants
to see the rest of Mommy.

24
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,850
Oh, my God, Scottie.
Is that a man up our tree?

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,940
No, no.
Tell her it's just a big bird.

26
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,300
Hey, pal, welcome.

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,720
Welcome to what? Where am l?

28
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,550
Aren't you that horny guy who
was pretending to be a big bird?

29
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,140
Checking out that beautiful mom?

30
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,800
Yes, I am.

31
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,520
Now you'll see what a big horny
bird actually looks like...

32
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,530
in Hell!

33
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,000
I deserve this!

34
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,490
-Knock, knock.
-Hey, Jimmy.

35
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,190
-What are you doing, Nicky?
-Just jamming.

36
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,370
Your father wants you and your
brothers in the throne room.

37
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,790
He's not retiring today, is he?

38
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,960
He wants to talk to you
and Cassius and Adrian...

39
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,830
about who'll rule Hell
for the next 10,000 years.

40
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,870
Why do I need to go?
He won't pick me.

41
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,300
I happen to think
you'd make a great Devil.

42
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,550
I'm not into evil and torture
and all that stuff.

43
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,770
Plus, the Prince of Darkness
should look distinguished...

44
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,350
and let's face facts,
I'm no George Clooney.

45
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,770
You're not
a bad-looking guy, Nicky.

46
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,690
Look at that picture.

47
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,640
I used to talk normal, too...

48
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,360
before Cassius hit me
in the face with a shovel.

49
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,610
That's me now, and I accept it.

50
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,870
Your brothers are two of
the sickest guys I've ever seen.

51
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,820
For some reason, you're not.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

52
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,540
Their mothers were fire dragons
and mine was a goat.

53
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,170
How do I compete with that?

54
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,880
Your mother was not a goat.
They're just playing with you.

55
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,590
If one of those psychos
gets picked, I'm doomed.

56
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,100
I knew it, Adrian.
He's finally retiring.

57
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,770
Cassius, I've been waiting on
this day for 10,000 years.

58
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,560
If the old man picks me
to take over Hell...

59
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,270
I'll keep torture going 24-7.
No breaks.

60
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,770
Whoa, mama!

61
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,810
You got him right in the eye.

62
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,240
Hey! How's Daddy's
little girl doing today?

63
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,330
I didn't see you guys.
What's up?

64
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,830
Shovel face,
you want to mind-wrestle?

65
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,370
Nah, I'm all right.

66
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,660
I was thinking of chilling out
by the throne for a bit.

67
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,420
I'm going to mind-wrestle you
whether you like it or not.

68
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,340
I have to warn you,
I'm getting pretty good at it.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,180
Then I guess
I can't make you do this.

70
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,340
Mercy. You win.
I give. Game over.

71
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,090
What are you boys doing?

72
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,640
Nothing, Dad. Just hitting
the old punching bags.

73
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,190
Cassius...

74
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,570
didn't I tell you to stay out
of your brother's mind?

75
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,440
I forgot.

76
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,700
Maybe this
will help you remember.

77
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,380
Now, everybody come sit down.

78
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,120
-Hey, Dad.
-Yes, son?

79
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,700
I know you got a lot
on your mind...

80
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,210
but I almost finished that
Monsters of Metal compilation.

81
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,720
I really think it's turning
into a masterpiece.

82
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,670
OK, kid.
We'll listen to it later.

83
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,600
Thanks.

84
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,640
A window.

85
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,020
Hello, Mr Devil.
I like your cape.

86
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,120
I deserve this!

87
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,370
Fellas, this,
as some of you might know...

88
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,620
is my 10,000th year
as Prince of Darkness...

89
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,210
so I think the time has come
to discuss who will succeed me.

90
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,130
-Knock, knock.
-Yes, Jimmy?

91
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,670
Don't forget--

92
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,510
you're shoving a pineapple
up Hitler's ass at four p.m.

93
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,520
This was a very
difficult decision...

94
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,650
because I have
three wonderful sons.

95
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,860
Adrian--so smart, so ruthless.

96
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,350
Wears makeup.

97
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,690
And Cassius--
so strong, so tough.

98
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,990
Don't forget clinically insane.

99
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,110
And Nicky...

100
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,280
such a sweet boy.

101
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,840
But after much thought
and careful consideration...

102
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,470
I've decided that the ruler
for the next 10,000 years...

103
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,390
is going to have to be...

104
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,010
me.

105
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,890
-What?
-Hallelujah!

106
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,680
I mean, that sucks!

107
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,390
The important thing
for the stability of our rule...

108
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,270
is to maintain the balance
between good and evil...

109
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,070
and I don't think any of you are
ready for that responsibility.

110
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,440
Dad, this is bullshit!

111
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,830
I don't like that language.

112
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,610
Right. Send him in.

113
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,710
Sorry, boys.
I have to get back to work.

114
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,660
It was good
hanging with you, Dad.

115
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,120
I'll check you later.

116
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,730
You're serious?

117
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,990
Off, off, off!

118
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,450
Damn!

119
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Twenty thousand years ago,
Grandpa Lucifer said...

120
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,050
"It's better to rule in Hell
than to serve in Heaven."

121
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,600
Well, I'm tired
of serving in Hell.

122
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,260
We need somewhere
where we can rule.

123
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,520
Bring it on, big man.
Let's see what you got.

124
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,690
Could you concentrate
for five seconds?

125
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,490
I am concentrating, man.

126
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,070
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,110
After careful consideration,
I must respectfully decline.

128
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,120
I can't stand retirement.

129
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,580
Just let me win one Super Bowl.

130
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,960
In exchange for eternal
damnation of your soul?

131
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,040
You're much too nice a guy
for that, Mr Marino.

132
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,880
You did it for Namath.

133
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,540
Joe was coming here anyways.

134
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,390
This sucks.

135
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,260
I'll go to the Super Bowl
as an announcer...

136
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
and win myself an Emmy!

137
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,880
That's the spirit.

138
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,060
You're a good Devil, Dad.

139
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,190
I also happen to be a Jets fan.

140
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,650
What do you think about Earth?

141
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,690
We could create
our own Hell there.

142
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,400
Are you saying we go up there
and kill everyone?

143
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,980
Eventually, Cassius...

144
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,570
but first we'd have to corrupt
as many souls as we can...

145
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,280
so when we do destroy them...

146
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,120
Their damned souls will be ours.

147
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,490
It's our time, brother.

148
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,000
This is not good.

149
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,050
Whoa, whoa.
Fellas, what are you doing?

150
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,550
We're leaving.

151
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,180
You can't go through there!

152
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,020
The fire flows in, not out.

153
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,570
You really suck!

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,610
Your Evilness!

155
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,780
Cassius and Adrian
have escaped from Hell.

156
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,070
They went out through the fire
and froze it.

157
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,990
I tried to stop them, sir,
but they overpowered me.

158
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,580
Calm down. Get off your knees.

159
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,040
Thank you for understanding,
Your Wickedness.

160
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,960
You're the man.
I've always said that.

161
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,840
Are there boobs on my head?

162
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,890
Yeah. Big ones.

163
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,060
What's going on, Dad?

164
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,510
I'm going to die, Nicky.
The gates are broken.

165
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,760
No new souls can get in,
so I'll start to deteriorate.

166
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,860
What's with all
those "hoo hoo" noises?

167
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,190
Everything's fine, Pop.

168
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,530
Everything's fine?
Who are you bullshitting?

169
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,660
Last time you said that,
the Renaissance happened.

170
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,360
Please, Pop,
go back to your room.

171
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,830
Can I take him with me?

172
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,530
Sure, Pop. Whatever you want.

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,750
Tit-head, go with my father.

174
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,470
Not a damn soul is going
to get through that.

175
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,470
This fire is solid as rock.

176
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,720
We got to get this bad boy
burning again.

177
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
To do that,
Cassius and Adrian...

178
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,800
have to come back through
the other way.

179
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,300
So go get them, Dad.

180
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,560
I'm too weak.
The process has already begun.

181
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,520
So go get them, Jimmy.

182
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm just a demon.
No Devil blood in me.

183
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,280
I wouldn't last two minutes
with your brothers.

184
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,650
Are you saying it's up to me?

185
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,490
You said no souls
could get through that.

186
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,000
Nicky, are you a soul
or the spawn of Satan?

187
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,580
I never been to Earth, Dad.

188
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,720
I never even slept over
some other dude's house.

189
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,960
The worst thing that could
happen is you get killed.

190
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,600
In which case, boom--
you end up back here.

191
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,060
So I need to go to Earth
and kill my brothers?

192
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,220
No go. They left together
at the exact same time.

193
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,220
They must come back together
at the exact same time.

194
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,270
Here.

195
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,200
Get them to drink from this.

196
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,110
One sip,
and they'll be trapped inside.

197
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,950
Once you've got both of them,
bring it back through the gate.

198
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,120
Let me, sir.

199
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,700
Gross!

200
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,960
He's got less than a week.

201
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,840
Dad, I don't know
if I can do this.

202
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,380
Son, you...

203
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,300
Try your best.

204
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,910
Earth.

205
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,070
It doesn't look too bad.

206
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,170
You were gone ten seconds.
What happened?

207
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,100
I got hit by this big light
attached to a lot of metal.

208
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,190
That's a train, son.
Don't stand in front of them.

209
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,770
I'll have to take a mulligan
on this one.

210
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,110
Please, Nicky,
get back up there.

211
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,440
All right.

212
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,400
I'll get that for you, sir.

213
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,210
I'm Nicky.

214
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,790
That's terrific.

215
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,180
Now get off the track
and come with me, handsome.

216
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,010
Welcome to Grand Central Station
in New York City.

217
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,180
My name is Beefy.

218
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,300
I'm an old friend
of your father's.

219
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,770
He asked me to help you out.

220
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,150
I just want to find my brothers
and be on my way.

221
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,520
It's not going to be easy.

222
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,320
Your brothers
can possess people...

223
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,490
so they probably
won't look like themselves.

224
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,730
You have to be suspicious
of everyone.

225
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,400
All right, bro.

226
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,120
The jig is up, then.
Get in the flask.

227
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,780
It ain't me, moron.

228
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,530
Sorry.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,670
There's this blind guy outside
you might think is possessed...

230
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,370
but he's just crazy.

231
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,050
Though I cannot see
with these blind eyes...

232
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,590
I know the good Lord
still loves me.

233
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,390
He loves all of his children.

234
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,390
-Why, he loves you...
-That's him.

235
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,480
...and he loves you.

236
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,560
Here he goes.

237
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,060
You make the Lord very nervous.

238
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,280
All right.

239
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,400
-I'm burning now.
-Take it easy.

240
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,940
Hellfire is burning me alive!

241
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,700
He's burning.

242
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,120
The Beast is alive!
He's among us!

243
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,990
Clear the streets!
The Devil is here!

244
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,090
Making friends already.

245
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,340
I don't know
what that guy's problem was.

246
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
It's freezing up here.

247
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,250
You're in the human world now,
kid.

248
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,590
You'll feel a lot of new things
you never felt before.

249
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,890
Let's get you some warm clothes
and hot food.

250
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,310
Put it in your mouth.

251
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,040
Now move your teeth
up and down.

252
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,290
Up and down.

253
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,040
Good, numb nuts.

254
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,220
Now you got to swallow it.

255
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,500
Tilt your head back...

256
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,550
and let the meat
slide down your throat hole.

257
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,090
Easy. Don't choke.

258
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,510
Popeye's chicken
is fucking awesome.

259
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,640
Now eat up.
You'll need your energy.

260
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,030
I got energy up the ying-yang.
Let's save Dad.

261
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,480
Adrian! Cassius!

262
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,900
Oh, boy.

263
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,110
So nice.

264
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I like your brassiere.

265
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,340
Thank you.

266
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,590
Could you guys maybe
not tell anyone about this?

267
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,050
You got it.

268
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,640
Do you mind maybe not telling
anybody about this?

269
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,510
You got it.

270
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,760
Look, sidewalk equals safety.

271
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,810
Middle of the road equals death.

272
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,070
From now on, I'll just avoid
all moving metal objects.

273
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,030
Great. Now, your father
gave me some deposit money...

274
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,700
for a nice pad
on the Upper East Side...

275
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,320
but I misplaced it.

276
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,540
I'm wasted!

277
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,710
So I found
this other joint for you...

278
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,880
but you're going
to have a roommate.

279
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,750
There's only one thing better...

280
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,960
than drinking
an ice-cold whiskey sour...

281
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,640
on a hot Alabama night...

282
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,260
and that's telling the truth.

283
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,300
I know what you think
about me, Grandma.

284
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,560
You think I'm worthless.

285
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,430
You think I'm a stumblebum...

286
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,390
who ain't never going
to amount to anything.

287
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,070
Well, old woman, you are wrong.

288
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,080
You are wrong.

289
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,280
Hello, friend.
My name is Nicky.

290
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,740
I understand
you are seeking a roommate...

291
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,700
as per your ad
in the "Village Voice."

292
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,660
Would it be possible for me
to fill the slot?

293
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,040
Don't you want
to know what rent is?

294
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,510
Yes. What is rent?

295
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,930
It's 1,200,
split down the middle.

296
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,180
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I rehearse with my partner...

297
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,110
so the living room's
going to be off-limits.

298
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,680
Off-limits.

299
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,480
Aren't you boiling hot
in that outfit?

300
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,650
It's 80 degrees in this hallway.
Where are you from, the South?

301
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,150
The Deep South.

302
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,740
-Why is that funny?
-I don't know.

303
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,870
OK. And sorry, guy,
but no doggies allowed.

304
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,750
Go on. Big day tomorrow.

305
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,680
And don't forget to do that
sleep thing I told you about.

306
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,720
Gotcha.

307
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,140
You're not my brother, are you?

308
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,680
I'm an only child.

309
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,720
You love acting.

310
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,930
I love pissing.

311
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,560
Oh, my God!

312
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,610
In today's Gospel...

313
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,040
the Lord tells us
how we should live...

314
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,370
if we wish to attain
the splendour of Heaven.

315
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,290
Or something like that.

316
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,080
Jesus this, Moses that.

317
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,040
Abraham hit me
with a wiffle ball bat.

318
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,970
The Lord said a lot of hibbity
jibbity bibbity swibbity.

319
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,300
But...

320
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,020
has he ever really done
anything for any of us?

321
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,570
Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR
in my driveway?

322
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,030
No.

323
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,650
I love that car.

324
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,950
Has the Lord given
any of my enemies the herpes?

325
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,530
No.

326
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,580
The Lord gave my son
the strength to get off drugs.

327
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,210
Ma'am, I know your son...

328
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,300
and, believe me,
he was better off on the drugs.

329
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,720
At least
when he was smoking hashish...

330
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,170
he used to make me laugh
occasionally.

331
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,060
After we tried for many years...

332
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,940
the Lord finally helped
my wife conceive a baby.

333
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,470
Your best friend Fitzy
helped your wife.

334
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,490
He helped her conceive it
all night long.

335
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,700
How about you, Mayor?

336
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,490
Has the Lord
ever done anything for you?

337
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,700
Well, you know, I wished
I could think of something...

338
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,130
but, to be honest with you,
I can't.

339
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,080
I can't think of a damn thing
he's ever done for me!

340
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,470
Kind of makes you wonder
if there even is a Lord...

341
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,670
if there is ultimate punishment
for our so-called sins.

342
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,640
Why don't we just have fun...

343
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,720
and do whatever the Hell
we want?

344
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,520
Let the sin begin!

345
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,940
Let the sin begin.

346
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,900
That was a good one.

347
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,690
This is so much fun!

348
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,410
I never want it to end.

349
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,870
Why should it end?
Who's going to stop us?

350
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,740
Come on. There's ten million
people in this city...

351
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,700
and the clock is ticking.

352
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,250
Let's rock and roll, then.

353
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,880
-Get in the flask.
-I'm not thirsty!

354
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,090
Cassius, I'll show you.

355
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,180
Cassius, get in the flask.

356
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,350
Get in the flask.

357
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,360
-May I help you?
-Get in the flask.

358
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,850
What are you talking about?

359
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,610
I'm talking about
an eight-piece. Let's go.

360
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,160
Look, it's OKfor me
to shit in the street...

361
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,540
but you got to use a toilet.

362
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,820
Nicky, where are you?

363
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,540
Aw, come on.

364
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What's he doing now?

365
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,910
Just get in the flask.
I got to get Adrian.

366
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,220
Gary's so hairy.

367
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,230
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

368
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,520
All that chasing
and running around...

369
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,360
is making me want
to do the sleep thing again.

370
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,770
Kid, I like your enthusiasm,
but we have to work on...

371
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,230
narrowing down
our list of suspects.

372
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,250
I'm going to check in with
some of my contacts uptown.

373
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:39,210
Kid's got a lot of evil in him
just begging to come out.

374
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,700
I will eat your heart.

375
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,200
There's our man.

376
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,750
Mr Sleepyhead must have some
major ties to the dark side.

377
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
What's with that guy?

378
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,590
It's got to be one
of his disciples or something.

379
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,310
My man's into
deep nocturnal shit.

380
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,690
I think that Devil guy
just got ripped off.

381
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,070
-Should we wake him up?
-You do it.

382
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,740
Rise and shine, Devil guy.

383
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,610
Some dude stole your shit.

384
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,620
What? Where?

385
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,910
-Which way did he go?
-That way.

386
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,620
Thanks. Give me back my flask!

387
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,040
Did you check out
the dragon mouth?

388
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,630
The Dark Prince is here.

389
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,010
Check out my stuff.
I got a comb only used twice.

390
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,730
I got a pepper shaker.
A silver doodad from Africa.

391
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,770
See something you like, my man?

392
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,610
I would like my flask back.

393
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,020
You calling me a thief?

394
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,230
I'm calling you
the guy who has my flask.

395
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,160
How would I have it
unless I was, in fact, a thief?

396
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,780
-I don't know.
-Now you've done it.

397
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,620
You messed
with my business, bitch.

398
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,290
I would appreciate it
if you kept your voice down.

399
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,790
You going all crazy-eyed on me.

400
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,970
I'll show you some crazy eye.

401
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,590
Look at this.
Come on, let's get busy.

402
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,720
-Excuse me, sir.
-Who?

403
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,590
Does that flask
belong to this man?

404
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,520
You calling me a thief, too?
Damn.

405
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,850
Look, the guy you ripped off
walked by and busted you...

406
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,480
so why don't you just give him
his flask back?

407
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,620
You going to bite me with
your snaggletooth if I don't?

408
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,200
No. But that policeman
might have something to say.

409
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,670
Take your dumb-ass canteen,
goofy.

410
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,420
Get your raggedy-ass clothes
and find another corner...

411
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,620
before I show you
what crazy really is.

412
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,120
Fine. I will.

413
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,630
I'm a businessman.

414
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,220
I'll be seeing you
in a few years.

415
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
Excuse me.

416
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,640
That was amazing.
I just wanted to thank you.

417
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,060
That's OK.
I get messed with all the time.

418
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,860
When I saw him do that to you,
I just lost it.

419
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,070
I hate when people
take advantage of tourists.

420
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,690
What makes you think
I'm a tourist?

421
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,370
Your accent, maybe.

422
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,240
Well, where are you from?

423
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,450
-The South.
-Really?

424
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,460
The Deep South.

425
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,300
Why are we laughing?

426
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,050
I don't know,
but I was enjoying it.

427
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,720
Your glasses are pretty.

428
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,720
They make your eyes
look big and sparkly.

429
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,520
It's fun looking at them.

430
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,520
My dad's an optometrist.

431
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,860
My dad's in Hell,
and he's falling apart.

432
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,650
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,610
It's really tough
when your folks get older.

434
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,740
I don't know what I would do
if I couldn't save him.

435
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,750
I'm sure a nice Southern boy
like you...

436
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,320
will figure something out.

437
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,750
You want some Popeye's?

438
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,670
No. I had my lunch already.

439
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,590
But I wouldn't mind
getting a gelati.

440
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,540
Could I come with you
to getting a gelati?

441
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,210
If you want to.

442
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,220
-Here you go, pal. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

443
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,640
It's freezing my hands.

444
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,730
-Even with those gloves on?
-It's cold.

445
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,610
-Let me wrap it.
-Please. Thank you.

446
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,900
Gelati.

447
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,230
Better?

448
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,830
Why are you taunting me
with your darkness?

449
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,740
Your evil,
it's stinking up our streets!

450
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,840
The end is near!
We are all going to die!

451
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,050
This town is really
going to Hell lately.

452
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,220
What part of town
do you live in?

453
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,590
I have an apartment.
I'm not sure where.

454
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,520
My dog knows, though.

455
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,260
You have a dog? What kind?

456
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,640
I don't know.
I'd ask him...

457
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,430
but he's uptown
meeting his contacts.

458
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,190
Say "Mr Beefy." Say it.

459
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,570
Mr Beefy.

460
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,140
And I love you!

461
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,480
You go to school?
What's that like?

462
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,820
I go
to Parsons School of Design.

463
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,280
I knew growing up
I wasn't much to look at...

464
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,750
so I concentrated on
making things that are pretty.

465
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,080
You have a nice smell
coming off you.

466
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,630
That's my perfume.

467
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,080
It's called
Comme de Sud Pacific.

468
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,840
I think that's French
for "Coconuts."

469
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,770
That's better than the gelati.

470
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,350
Valerie, it feels like there's
a bunch of butterflies...

471
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,850
flapping around
in my stomach right now.

472
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,600
Is that normal?

473
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,190
Sometimes, sure.

474
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,280
Good, because I was concerned.

475
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,110
Why did they do this to me?
I was good to them.

476
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,370
I can hardly notice. Honest.

477
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,750
I sure hope Nicky's
kicking some ass on Earth...

478
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,160
or we are doomed.

479
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,340
I was the one who created Hell.

480
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,710
I know, Your Hatefulness.

481
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,880
Actually, the credit
belongs to my first wife.

482
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,300
She was the inspiration.

483
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,970
Chewbacca, take it easy,
will you?

484
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,220
You look like my first wife.
Only she had more hair.

485
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,810
In another startling
announcement from City Hall...

486
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,680
Mayor Randolph has,
effective immediately...

487
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,200
Iowered the legal drinking age
from twenty-one to ten.

488
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,450
When an adult goes to Hell,
that's terrific.

489
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,450
But when a child goes...

490
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,250
That's why I'm in this business.

491
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,250
Little Nicky.

492
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,880
-Know what's nice about you?
-What?

493
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,350
I like the way you're happy
just being yourself.

494
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,760
You don't try to act cool.

495
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,510
Thanks much, Valerie.

496
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,810
You know what's nice about you?

497
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,390
Your juicy heart-shaped heinie.

498
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,890
What was that?

499
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,200
I don't know why I said that.
I meant to say that...

500
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,620
I've always dreamt about
having sex with a gross pig.

501
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,500
Can I wash my winky
in your kitchen sinky?

502
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,240
You're a real jerk!

503
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,090
I didn't mean to be.

504
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,340
What the--Adrian!

505
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,880
Dad needs you
to come back to Hell.

506
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,050
So he sent old Shovel Face
to fetch me.

507
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,590
I'm not kidding.
He's in trouble.

508
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,810
So are you.

509
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,190
Hey, Valerie!

510
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,440
What is your problem?

511
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,690
I'm sorry!

512
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,530
Adrian, you froze the fire gate,
and Dad is dying...

513
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,450
so get your booty
back home or else!

514
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,410
You can't talk tough, Nicky.

515
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,630
Even the voice inside your head
has a speech impediment.

516
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,420
You're going back
because I'm going to make you!

517
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,460
How about this?
I'll stay here...

518
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,090
enjoying my pizza
and my peppermint schnapps...

519
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,050
and you go back.

520
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,510
Adrian, don't!

521
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,980
Cut the crap! This is serious!

522
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,260
Come on!

523
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,940
I was driving to work today...

524
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,780
some bozo in a Cadillac
cuts me off.

525
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
So I followed him.

526
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,690
When he got out of his car,
I run up behind him...

527
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,200
and start bashing his brains in
with this bat.

528
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,990
Did you ever see
"The Untouchables"?

529
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,700
I was De Niro!

530
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,080
What's happened to you, Regis?

531
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,670
The mayor's office today...

532
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,210
along with the New York
Board of Tourism...

533
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,140
unveiled its new motto
to replace "I Love New York."

534
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,850
"I Love Hookers" will now be
the city's catch phrase.

535
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,050
Your brothers are upsetting
the balance...

536
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,800
between good and evil.

537
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,390
What can I do about it?

538
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,440
You can't do jack shit...

539
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,400
unless you learn
your evil powers.

540
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,980
Go get a soda out of the fridge.

541
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,570
But those are
my roommate's sodas.

542
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,320
"But those are
my roommate's sodas."

543
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,320
Does that sound like a statement
the son of the Devil would make?

544
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,820
All right. Take it easy.

545
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,660
You have the power to change
the cola in that can...

546
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,290
into any other liquid.

547
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,090
Engine oil, bat's blood,
moose piss.

548
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,090
You just have to release
the evil within.

549
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,750
Release the evil?

550
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,970
I'm just saying
there's wickedness in you.

551
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,470
I can tell from your snores.

552
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,850
Really?

553
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,220
Release your evil.

554
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,060
Release the evil.

555
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,530
Come on, you can do it.

556
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,530
There it is.

557
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,740
You got it in you.

558
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,160
What are you doing?

559
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,160
I'm going to pretend I didn't
see a dog on the couch...

560
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,090
because my brain just can't
process that right now.

561
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,380
But were you about
to drink one of my Cokes?

562
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,550
No. I was just looking at it.

563
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,100
It's beautiful.

564
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,280
This Coke tastes like Pepsi.

565
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,920
You changed a Coke into a Pepsi?

566
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,500
That was
your big transformation?

567
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Come on, man,
give it up a little.

568
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,920
It was pretty good
for my first try.

569
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,630
Do you care that your brothers
are killing your father?

570
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,960
Yes, I care!

571
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,180
And he is not going to die!

572
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,550
Atta-boy.

573
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,300
I'm freaked out.
My television just blew up.

574
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,680
You're damn right it did!

575
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,770
I mean, really?

576
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,190
I know this is
your living room time...

577
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,140
but could I finish watching
the Globetrotters out here?

578
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,820
It's the craziest game
I've ever seen.

579
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,460
He's walking! Get him a bus!

580
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,630
This is the part I don't get.

581
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,010
Another terrible call.

582
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,300
There's no way
that was travelling.

583
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,720
What's with all the calls?
We haven't lost in 53 years!

584
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,430
Guess what, cornrows?

585
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,180
Technical foul!
You're out of here!

586
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,810
Why's the referee being so mean
to the Globetrotters, Daddy?

587
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,600
I've been watching these guys
play since I was your age.

588
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,190
It's all part of the show, baby.

589
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,610
That guy in the striped shirt...

590
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,120
snapped his fingers
like somebody I know!

591
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,880
Normally the Globetrotters
represent family entertainment.

592
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,930
Who gives a shit?

593
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,590
These kids came here to see
the Globetrotters win!

594
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,060
Ten points off the Globetrotters
on account of the bigmouth!

595
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,310
It's all part of the show, baby!

596
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,150
Hit the half-time buzzer.
I'm tired.

597
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,440
If the second half doesn't
get any better than this...

598
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,900
you can expect
a full-scale riot.

599
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,450
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now time...

600
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,500
for the Globetrotters' half-time
half-court heave-ho throw!

601
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,500
If the contestant makes it...

602
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,590
everyone here
will get a free pizza pie!

603
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,210
I ain't taking the shot.
These people are crazy.

604
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,300
Excuse me. I'll take that shot.

605
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,010
What made you want to see
the Globetrotters today, son?

606
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,930
I came for the beer
and the bitches.

607
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,020
Look who's back from the dead.

608
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,070
Six-six-six! Pickup sticks!

609
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,200
Please welcome Miguel Sanchez
from the Bronx, New York!

610
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,570
What's Nicky doing there?

611
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,740
Trying to capture
his brother in a flask...

612
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,490
and preserve the balance
of good and evil on Earth.

613
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,450
-Did you just talk?
-No.

614
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:27,170
-Are you Miguel from the Bronx?
-No. I'm Nicky from the South.

615
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,040
Hey, give me that!

616
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,960
You better win these people
some free pizza...

617
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,470
because it looks like they're
about to kill each other.

618
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,550
All right.

619
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,760
Who's that man, Mommy?

620
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,010
I don't know,
but he sure is butt-ugly.

621
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,270
Release the evil.

622
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,060
Too much evil.

623
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,150
I think that ball just blew up,
and, yes, my hair is aflame.

624
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,240
I don't know
what the Hell that was.

625
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,410
-Don't do it again, huh?
-All right.

626
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,370
I command you not to blow up
and go into that metal circle.

627
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,830
Get that crap out of here!

628
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,090
I know you're having fun,
Cassius...

629
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,550
but you really got
to come back to Hell.

630
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,770
Look around you, Nicky.
We're in Hell. The new Hell.

631
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,440
Do it! Do it! Do it!

632
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,200
I was sent here
to take you back...

633
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,570
and that's what I'm going to do.

634
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,660
Don't make me take out
the shovel again, Trick.

635
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,070
I think we're about to see
a Devil showdown.

636
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,950
Dad got sick when you guys left.

637
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,910
I'm glad he's dying...

638
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,500
because it's my turn now.

639
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,670
You're going to wish
you never said that.

640
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,260
Take him to the hole, Nicky.

641
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,220
I mean, woof woof.

642
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,850
Come on, brother, come on!

643
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,020
Come on!

644
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,530
Daddy can't help you!

645
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,170
Enough!

646
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,840
This show gets better
every year!

647
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,680
That was sick.
Who taught you that shit?

648
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,260
Sorry, Cassius.

649
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,850
It must be the Super Devil Juice
Dad gave me.

650
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,310
Super Devil Juice?
Give me that, little girl.

651
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,050
Don't drink out of it, please!

652
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:06,660
Now that was some straight-up
David Copperfield shit!

653
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,950
Damn you, Nicky!

654
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,330
There ain't no Super Devil Juice
in here!

655
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,540
Hail, Nicky!

656
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,870
We are forever your slaves!

657
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,380
-So your father's the Devil.
-Sí, seòor.

658
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,800
You're a talking dog from Hell.
You guys are who?

659
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,140
A couple of big fans of Nicky
and the work his dad does.

660
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:34,100
By the way, Nicky,
check this out.

661
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,150
What's Ozzy trying to say there?

662
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,240
John, absolutely nothing.

663
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,030
The Blizzard always
came straight with his messages.

664
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,830
But wrap your minds around this,
gentlemen.

665
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,330
Chicago.

666
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,670
I love this song.

667
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,850
I command you
in the name of Lucifer...

668
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,260
to spread the blood
of the innocent.

669
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,980
Oh, my God, Chicago kicks ass!

670
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,180
That was awesome.

671
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,060
You know, guys,
this cake tastes a little funny.

672
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,150
I dumped a fat sack of reefer
in the mix.

673
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,520
Thought I'd spice up the bash.

674
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,820
-Really?
-What's reefer?

675
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,490
About five hundred bucks
an ounce.

676
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,340
Come on, Nicky, one more time.

677
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,510
I can't. It's starting to hurt.

678
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,100
Come on, you totally got to!

679
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,720
All right, all right. Last time.

680
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,730
Here he goes!

681
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,270
That's insane!

682
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,780
How do you do that?

683
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,740
I used to get messed up
like this...

684
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,910
with my first girlfriend
Heather.

685
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,670
We'd get so loopy,
she would forget I was a dog.

686
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,960
-She was a human?
-No. A sewer rat.

687
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,580
Man, that pissed my parents off.

688
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,420
You know, I was in love once...

689
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,510
but she said I wasn't
financially reliable...

690
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,140
and she needed that.

691
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,340
By "she," do you mean "he"?

692
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,020
-No.
-Busted!

693
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,600
Please.

694
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:42,810
How you feeling over there,
Satan Abdul-Jabbar?

695
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,990
A little strange.

696
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,820
I can't stop thinking
about this girl Valerie.

697
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,740
Why? Did she hurt you?

698
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,000
Do you need to cry
on my shoulder?

699
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,570
Easy, Liberace.

700
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,750
Would you grow up?

701
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,700
Liberace.

702
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,580
I was having the best day
with her...

703
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,630
until Adrian made me tell her
she had a heart-shaped heinie.

704
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,050
Maybe you love her.
But what do I know?

705
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,800
I can't even see straight.

706
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,470
Me, too! We got to get going.

707
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,510
You guys can crash here.
I have an extra futon.

708
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,220
That's a big pass, Elton John.

709
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,230
Ozzy starts in 30 minutes.
That'll cheer you up, Nicky.

710
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,730
Yeah, let's roll.

711
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,900
I can't give the Ozz man
the full focus he deserves.

712
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,280
Sorry, fellas.

713
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,860
This chick must be
the real deal, then.

714
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,290
-Later, bro.
-Good-bye, John.

715
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,080
-Good luck, Nicky.
-OK, Pete.

716
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,170
You better snap out
of it soon, kid...

717
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,710
because we're going
after Adrian tomorrow...

718
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,420
bright and early.
Night-night.

719
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,470
Yeah, I know.
Get some sleep thing, Mr Beefy.

720
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,980
That is the most horrifying
thing I have ever seen.

721
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,740
Go to her.

722
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,630
All right.

723
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,920
I smell coconuts.

724
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,010
Coconuts.

725
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,610
That dude looks like a lady.

726
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,070
You want to come in?

727
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,490
Actually, I'm looking
for a girl named Valerie.

728
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,410
Valerie Veran?
Two floors up, one window over.

729
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:00,620
Thanks much.

730
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,740
Good luck
with the nipple rubbing.

731
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,580
I don't need luck. I'm good.

732
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,040
I can see that.

733
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,280
Oh, my God!
Nicky, is that you?

734
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,820
Stay right there.

735
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,910
I will.

736
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,040
What were you thinking
coming here?

737
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,630
I don't know, but it didn't
involve going blind.

738
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,670
Oh, my God! Nicky!

739
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,020
Please don't die!

740
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,430
What are you doing?

741
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,110
I think I'm floating.

742
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:14,060
Why would you be floating?

743
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,820
Maybe it was because
of this cake I ate earlier.

744
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,660
Am I supposed to not be
freaked out right now?

745
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,870
Because I am.

746
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,450
I'm freaked out, too.

747
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,540
The butterflies in my stomach
are flapping around...

748
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,670
in a way I've never felt before.

749
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,040
You got the wrong window again,
man.

750
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,220
Oh, sorry, Nipples. Valerie!

751
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,880
-Nicky, over here.
-I'm coming.

752
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,680
Oh, my God, you made it.

753
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,760
Valerie, I can see again,
and you look beautiful.

754
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,180
Just because you're floating...

755
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,600
doesn't mean I'm going to forget
you giving me the finger.

756
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,180
That wasn't me.

757
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,810
I was being possessed
by my brother Adrian.

758
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,360
What do you mean, possessed?

759
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,610
Remember when I told you
that my father was in Hell?

760
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,860
That's because he's the Devil...

761
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:04,700
and he wants to keep his throne
for another 10,000 years.

762
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,660
And that pissed off
my brothers...

763
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,540
so they broke
the gates of Hell...

764
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,700
which is making my father
decompose.

765
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:17,500
I love my father very much,
so I came to Earth to save him.

766
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,920
Now I get that Deep South joke.

767
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,430
I don't know
if I should believe you.

768
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,890
You got to believe.
Believe in the butterflies.

769
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,730
Wait. OK. OK, OK, I believe.

770
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,980
Come on. Come back up.

771
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,400
Take my hand, Valerie.

772
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,200
Fly with me.
I can give you the power.

773
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,960
That's
the Empire State Building.

774
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,630
There's Popeye's chicken--
right there.

775
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,260
The Hell Beast is above us...

776
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,640
and I can smell an evil slut.

777
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,600
Whoa, Devil!

778
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,930
Did you do that?

779
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,070
Nobody calls my girl
an evil slut.

780
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,020
Good morning, New York.

781
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,820
This is an "Action News"
special report.

782
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,280
A shocking crime...

783
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,150
results in a record
fifty-million-dollar reward...

784
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,080
for the capture of this man.

785
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,650
His name is unknown...

786
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,360
but his actions have earned him
the label "The Monster."

787
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,290
He should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

788
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,250
The man who caused
such a sensation...

789
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,120
at the game yesterday
is no hero.

790
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:40,000
He is, in fact, a mass murderer.

791
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,680
-This is real bad.
-Where the heck is Nicky?

792
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,170
I have authorized a reward...

793
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,600
to the person
who brings this man to me.

794
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,890
It's a setup.

795
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:53,310
Good morning, young lady.

796
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,400
That looks like it tastes great.

797
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,770
Look at that.

798
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,150
Mr Beefy would like you.

799
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,990
Oh, look.

800
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:50,440
There he is!

801
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,540
Wait. Wait.

802
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,160
What is happening?

803
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,250
There he is!

804
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,920
I'm not a monster.

805
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,810
Release the evil.

806
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,670
Beefy, I think I'm in trouble.

807
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,550
The shit has hit the fan, kid.

808
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:29,880
Take a look.

809
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,680
This videotape
will show what he did...

810
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,680
after he left the game.

811
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,720
Say hello to my little friend.

812
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,690
My name is Nicky...

813
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,440
and I'm going to kill all
you suckers for no reason.

814
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,020
That's not me! That's
that cockroach Tony Montana!

815
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,570
-Difficult to watch, I know.
-This is Adrian's work.

816
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,370
He superimposed your head
onto "Scarface."

817
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,120
Which is probably DePalma's
third best film.

818
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,330
I'm not Nicky.

819
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,700
Dude, it's us. Let us in.

820
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,410
-John! Pete!
-Nicky!

821
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,590
There's a total mob scene
coming this way.

822
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,630
It looks like they're following
a giant trail of bug shit.

823
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,210
What do we do now, Beefy?

824
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,340
I don't know. This is
a little out of my league.

825
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,350
-What would your dad do, Nicky?
-That's a great idea!

826
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,270
I'll ask him. Kill me.

827
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:20,680
Are you serious?

828
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,270
Yes. We'll meet
at Grand Central Station, noon.

829
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,480
Now I command you--do me.

830
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:27,940
All right!

831
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,860
That just hurt a lot.

832
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,280
Still alive, though.

833
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,620
I've always wanted
to kill someone.

834
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,790
Can I give it a try?

835
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,210
Damn you, Kevin Spacey!

836
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,800
You take all my parts!

837
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,050
Hey, you lose--royal flush.

838
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,430
Off with the brassiere.

839
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:59,010
The last time I saw
a pair of jugs that big...

840
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,220
two hillbillies
were blowing on them.

841
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,690
Oh, my God, Dad.

842
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,860
Nicky, I got no legs.

843
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,520
I got no hips.

844
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,450
I got one ear.

845
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:16,740
I got no ears.

846
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,240
Now he has no ears.
Are you happy, Nicky?

847
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,910
Adrian's got the whole city
following me.

848
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,660
I can't hear you, Nicky!

849
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,540
Check one, two. Check one, two.

850
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:26,920
Put it back on my head!

851
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,920
You got until midnight tonight.

852
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,880
Get your ass back up there,
and save your father. Go!

853
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,550
-I'm going to save you, Dad.
-Go, go, go!

854
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,260
-I'm going to save you!
-Go, then! Move it!

855
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:40,970
Go, Nicky, go!

856
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,640
Sure you're down with this?

857
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:45,150
A little nervous. Want to puke.

858
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,190
Hey, hey, fuzz.
We know where to find Nicky.

859
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,620
-Let's go.
-Get in.

860
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,240
What's up, Police Chief?

861
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,110
-You have what I want.
-You got what we want?

862
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,570
Fifty million bones, bro.

863
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,670
-Here's the money.
-Whoa, my God!

864
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,200
That's half of it. You get
the rest when I get Nicky.

865
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,870
Thanks much.

866
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,750
I got to warn you, man.
He's kind of not human.

867
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,890
-Really?
-He might be the son of Satan.

868
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,520
I guess I'll have to be
extra careful, then, aren't l?

869
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,940
Now, where is he?

870
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,940
Hey, come on, that was cool!

871
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,570
Do it again!

872
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,530
Out of the way!

873
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,920
Where is he? He's late.

874
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,370
He'll be here.
Just keep your skirt on.

875
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,080
That's where he comes out of.

876
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:51,920
Over there!

877
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,420
We've been ratted out.

878
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,840
We thought the son of Satan
would understand such a move.

879
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:00,930
-Get these two out of here.
-All right, this way.

880
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,220
What is this?
A bulldog and his gay lover?

881
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,520
Oh, shut up.

882
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,770
It's true. It's true.

883
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,100
Judas.

884
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,530
Judas Priest, maybe.

885
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,480
I'm only an actor.
I don't know what's happening.

886
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:18,110
Take him to the holding area.
Seal off all the exits.

887
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,070
I'm only an actor!

888
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,150
You want to see something cool?

889
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,950
Definitely.

890
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,180
Pick me a winner.

891
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,640
Oh, sick!

892
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,640
Oh, my God, that was awesome!

893
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,600
So, what time's
my brother expected back?

894
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:53,100
Noon. Ish.

895
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:55,400
Even though you're
not really the chief...

896
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,490
we still get the rest
of the cash, right, bro?

897
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,320
You know what you'll get, boys?

898
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,530
An indescribably
horrific torture...

899
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:05,280
administered by demons
for the rest of eternity.

900
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,290
And we get to keep the cash,
too, right?

901
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,830
Sure.

902
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,620
Why not?

903
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,790
You're hurting me.

904
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,420
Shut up.

905
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,600
Applesauce every time.

906
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,930
Hey, boys!

907
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,560
You want a blizzard
with my flip-flop?

908
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,980
No, thanks, but we'll take
that bottle of booze.

909
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,650
Beat it, you freak.
Get out of here.

910
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,490
I'll be back with my flip-flop!

911
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:45,990
Schnapps.

912
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,280
Peppermint?

913
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,330
All right!

914
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,090
Want a hit?

915
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:59,830
Drink up.
Here's to fifty million clams.

916
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,010
To the defilement of Earth
and corruption of its people.

917
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,470
OK, whatever.
Just drink it.

918
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:06,960
Cheers.

919
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,650
It's awfully hot down here.

920
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,980
How do you manage
to stay so cool?

921
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,490
Beer lowers
the body temperature.

922
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,740
I read that in a beer magazine.

923
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:36,920
This liquid
will probably quench my thirst.

924
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,210
-Cool me off.
-Definitely.

925
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,000
Give you a pretty good buzz.

926
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,430
Or maybe it will trap me inside
for all of eternity.

927
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,560
No, it won't?

928
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,690
Oh, Nicky.
I've missed you.

929
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,030
Come out and say hello!

930
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:01,950
I'm not Nicky.

931
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,480
I'm calling you out, brother!

932
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:11,280
Adrian, this is very painful.

933
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,630
-There you are.
-I told you he was sick.

934
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,260
Oh, hello, Cassius.

935
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,190
All right, Adrian! Let me out!

936
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:35,600
New Hell really only needs
one new Satan.

937
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,480
You motherfu--

938
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,060
But Cassius could use
some company for eternity.

939
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,280
So get in the flask.

940
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:44,940
Kick his ass, Nicky.

941
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,150
Sleep.

942
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,030
You got it.

943
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,210
Hey, hold up.
Someone's got to take a pee.

944
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,910
That dog's got smoke balls!

945
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,340
Run, Beefy! Run!

946
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,430
You can't make me drink, Adrian.

947
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:09,970
Of course I can.

948
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,470
Oh, it's Nicky's
little ragamuffin.

949
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,190
Drink or she dies.

950
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,110
Unlike you, she won't come back
from where she's going.

951
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:27,870
Let go of her!
This is between you and me!

952
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:31,830
I hear a train a-coming!

953
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,910
Adrian, stop!

954
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:38,080
-Drink!
-All right! Don't hurt her!

955
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,170
Don't do it, Nicky!

956
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,460
I have to, Valerie.

957
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,350
Now, that hurt the both of us.

958
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,240
See you in Hell!

959
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,630
Hey, look at the bright side.
You can go for a swim.

960
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,880
You can play the harmonica,
and you can choke someone.

961
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,420
Take me to my room.
I want to be alone!

962
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,790
In your weakened condition,
if you vacate the throne...

963
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,930
any of your sons can claim
the seat of power for their own.

964
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,130
Horseshit.

965
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,340
Hey, good news.
Adrian's back.

966
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,140
I'm going to be all right?

967
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:40,810
Where's Nicky?

968
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:42,730
He came with you and Cassius,
right?

969
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,690
I came through that gate alone.

970
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,730
Sorry, sir. False alarm.

971
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,780
Would everyone stop
playing with me...

972
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,480
and tell me
what my brother's up to?

973
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,670
What is this?

974
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,640
Is it Dad's birthday?

975
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,200
There he is.

976
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:41,490
Hi! I can't believe you're here!

977
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,790
Welcome.

978
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,790
Up with the sign.

979
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,330
Can I just tell you
I am so excited right now?

980
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,090
-So excited!
-She really is.

981
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:54,100
If you could point me
to the Black Palace...

982
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,050
I really got to check in
with my dad.

983
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:01,720
Can I ask you something?

984
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,730
What do you know about your mom?

985
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,470
My mom.

986
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:09,230
My brothers tell me
that she was a mountain goat...

987
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,020
which would explain
my chronic halitosis.

988
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:14,450
A mountain goat?
That's really sweet.

989
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,020
Jenna, chair.

990
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:19,120
Thanks.

991
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,290
My mother wasn't a goat?

992
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,620
Try an angel.

993
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:28,340
An angel?

994
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,040
I'm your mom.

995
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:37,550
If you're my mom,
then how come you're not older?

996
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,970
Angels don't get any older, son.

997
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:43,190
I can't believe
you just called him "son."

998
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,970
This is so wild!

999
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:53,610
Jenna, Christa.
Time for your mambo lesson.

1000
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,530
Chubbs, I'm so sorry.
I totally spaced.

1001
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,900
I have company.
This is my son Nicky.

1002
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,490
Chubbs used to be a golf pro...

1003
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,750
but up here he's just
the dopest dance instructor.

1004
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,040
Ah, that's nice.

1005
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,500
You mambo?

1006
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:08,910
I don't think so.

1007
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,130
It's all in the hips.

1008
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,680
-Bye, Chubbs.
-All in the hips, yeah!

1009
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,630
Nobody in this room
will tell you a thing, Adrian.

1010
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,180
Right!

1011
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,390
Hey, let him go!

1012
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:27,440
Perhaps a titty-twister
will loosen your lips.

1013
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,060
I'm getting turned on.

1014
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,850
All I know is that if you
sit on that throne...

1015
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,980
in your father's
weakened condition--

1016
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,150
Tit-head, no!

1017
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,980
You can claim the seat of power
for your own.

1018
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:42,830
Really?

1019
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,620
As the founder of Hell...

1020
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,160
I command you
to stay off that throne!

1021
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,920
Even in Hell I get no respect.

1022
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,340
Put me down!

1023
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,650
So where did you meet Dad?

1024
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,200
It was a long time ago
at this Heaven-Hell mixer.

1025
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:25,200
I remember that night.
You had, like, four daiquiris.

1026
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,530
At first
I didn't really like him.

1027
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,410
-He was really conceited.
-But he was funny.

1028
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,790
And I hate to admit it,
but he had a really hot body.

1029
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,380
Puppy phone.

1030
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,840
It's so cute.

1031
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,550
Hi, Michelle.
Yeah, he's here right now.

1032
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:44,340
I don't know if he's hot.
He's my son, you perv.

1033
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:46,050
Can I call you back?

1034
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,730
That was my friend Michelle.
She says hi.

1035
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:51,560
Say hi back.

1036
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,600
I'll just call her later.

1037
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,640
We totally saw you
save your girlfriend's life.

1038
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:57,730
That was so cool.

1039
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,020
That's why you came to Heaven
instead of Hell.

1040
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,150
Self-sacrifice
automatically gets you here.

1041
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,650
How did you see me?

1042
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,040
We can see anything
that's going on on Earth. Look.

1043
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,490
Someone else is taking
the internship.

1044
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,200
That's "Felicity."
I love that show. Do you watch?

1045
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,960
I haven't seen it,
but I hear good things.

1046
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,050
This is an "Action News"
special report.

1047
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:22,630
Moments ago, a large chunk
of what appears to be Hell...

1048
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,470
began to rise
from beneath Central Park.

1049
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,680
Far from being terrified...

1050
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,140
many New Yorkers have begun
flocking to the site...

1051
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,230
turning it into an unofficial
party central.

1052
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,020
And this just in...

1053
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,980
I'm cheating on my husband
with the weatherman.

1054
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:42,400
Show him Central Park.

1055
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,240
I love your legs.

1056
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,300
That's my father's throne!

1057
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:07,640
-Is Dad OK?
-Let's see.

1058
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,060
I was a good Devil, wasn't l?

1059
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,680
You were the best Devil, sir!

1060
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:15,640
If we fall in there,
we will die. Period.

1061
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:18,860
My underwear is so far up my ass
I could taste it.

1062
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,150
I hear that.

1063
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:23,820
Welcome to the party!

1064
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:29,610
It's so nice
to see you all here.

1065
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,320
I'm so proud of you.

1066
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:36,540
You've taken to sin
with such minimal prompting.

1067
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:42,790
You're acting as if
there is no Heaven or Hell.

1068
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,880
Well, I've got news for you.

1069
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:56,100
There is most definitely a Hell.

1070
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,350
What?

1071
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,940
And you're all
going there when you die.

1072
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,650
Which is in about
fifteen minutes.

1073
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,950
Holy shit,
we really are going to die!

1074
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,990
I'm really burning now!

1075
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,040
What are we going to do?

1076
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,960
I got to help her.

1077
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,130
I got to help Dad.

1078
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:25,340
I got to help everybody.

1079
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,750
At the stroke of midnight...

1080
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,930
my father will be
completely deteriorated...

1081
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,560
and all your souls will be mine.

1082
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,350
Soon you will see things...

1083
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,890
more horrible
than you can even imagine.

1084
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:44,610
Well, maybe not that horrible,
but still pretty bad.

1085
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,410
So, while we wait...

1086
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,200
for your enjoyment...

1087
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,780
I bring you a dear, sweet man--

1088
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,780
Mr Henry Winkler.

1089
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:56,910
Good evening.

1090
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,080
Covered in bees!

1091
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,550
How can I win?

1092
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:09,050
Adrian is stronger
and smarter than me.

1093
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:10,260
Stronger, yes.

1094
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,350
Smarter, definitely.

1095
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:14,680
But you have something
that he doesn't have.

1096
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,390
A speech impediment?

1097
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,270
The inner light, honey.

1098
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:22,110
And you can totally use it.

1099
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:25,140
-It's the best power of all.
-I do?

1100
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:28,570
And God told me if you
get in really bad trouble...

1101
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:30,410
you can use this.

1102
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,580
What is it?

1103
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,580
I'm not totally
a hundred percent on that...

1104
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,710
but God said when the time came,
you'd know what to do with it.

1105
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,030
God's so smart.

1106
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,130
Like "Jeopardy!" smart.

1107
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,330
My little boy.

1108
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,470
Mommy,
get me to the Big Apple...

1109
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:52,090
because I'm going to
rock that town like a hurricane.

1110
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,890
You're already there.

1111
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:55,350
Bye, Nicky.

1112
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:57,220
Bye, Mom.

1113
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,150
Bye, guys.

1114
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,360
Release the good.

1115
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:24,330
Yes, they're furry.

1116
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,620
Bunny, bunny, bunny!

1117
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,250
Release the awesome.

1118
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:35,470
What you do is put it
in your mouth...

1119
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:40,060
and let the meat slide down
your throat hole.

1120
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,480
Not you, not you!

1121
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:50,490
Popeye's chicken
is the shizzney!

1122
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:13,300
You know, from this angle,
you're kind of cute.

1123
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,960
You think so?

1124
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:17,800
Oh, my God.

1125
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,510
He just opened his mouth
and swallowed that spit.

1126
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,810
That turn you on there, RuPaul?

1127
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,310
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1128
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,070
Little Nicky.

1129
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,160
I knew you would make it!

1130
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,950
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely.

1131
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,710
Let my friends alone...

1132
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:47,160
and get in the flask.

1133
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,410
Is this a joke?

1134
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,510
No, it's the inner light...

1135
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:53,670
and with it,
we can defeat whatever you got.

1136
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:55,380
It's true!

1137
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,810
It's not true!

1138
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,390
Run, traitors, run!

1139
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,190
OK, Adrian.

1140
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:10,400
You've left me no choice.

1141
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:25,210
Leave this to me.

1142
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,370
Let's see what you've got.

1143
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:15,290
Enough!

1144
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,600
I'm going to kill you
with my bare hands.

1145
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,340
I'm ready for you.

1146
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,340
I guess I wasn't ready.

1147
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,150
-I totally had to do that.
-Hell, yeah!

1148
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,530
-Good job!
-That's great!

1149
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,410
Thanks, Mom !

1150
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,710
I'm going to ask you nicely.

1151
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:55,080
Get in the fla--

1152
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:58,340
You want a pillow fight, do you?

1153
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,290
Let's let the feathers fly.

1154
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:04,090
Come on, now.

1155
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,760
Come on.

1156
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,730
I'm right here.
Where am I going with it, baby?

1157
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:15,220
Here I am.

1158
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,100
I'm sleeping.

1159
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:21,740
Or am l?

1160
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:26,740
Thanks, Mr Winkler.

1161
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,500
I'm asking you one last time.

1162
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,000
Get in the flask.

1163
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,340
A little help here, please.

1164
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:37,590
Please!

1165
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,670
Don't do this! No!

1166
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,100
Good-bye, Nicky.

1167
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,180
Nice to see you, brothers.

1168
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,450
Now I'm going to bust
both of your heads wide open!

1169
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,200
-Come on!
-Get 'em, Nicky!

1170
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:11,660
Come on, Nicky!

1171
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:15,990
You can do it, Nicky!
Kick him in his hairy balls!

1172
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,920
Good idea.

1173
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,330
One down, one to go, Adrian.

1174
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,710
You've asked for this.
Time for the shovel!

1175
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,050
Bring it on!

1176
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,670
-Kill him, Adrian!
-Shut up!

1177
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,100
-Get him, Nicky!
-Let go of me!

1178
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:06,090
How did a nice Southern boy
learn to fight like that?

1179
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,560
I guess from my father's side
of the family.

1180
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,570
What? No tongue?

1181
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,780
Catch me if you can!

1182
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,420
That is wicked!

1183
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:47,880
Not long now!

1184
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:51,670
You got to fly out.

1185
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,520
Soon it will all be mine!

1186
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,850
Nicky! I know you can do it.

1187
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:57,310
Run, run!

1188
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,150
Do it for the butterflies.

1189
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,230
Butterflies?

1190
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,280
The power of good
lets you fly out.

1191
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:11,200
Well, you're too late, Nicky!

1192
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,000
Behold your new Satan!

1193
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,710
What's that?
What's with the ball?

1194
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,920
-Ozzy?
-Holy shit.

1195
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,590
No, no, no!

1196
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:32,470
You can do it, Ozzy!

1197
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:35,060
Bite his fricking head off!

1198
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,430
Spit him in the flask!

1199
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:40,930
Here you go, Ozzy.

1200
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:48,990
-Grand Central, Nicky!
-Start running.

1201
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:50,700
-You'll never make it.
-You've got to die.

1202
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,280
I'll just go to Heaven.

1203
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:55,280
Not if you do something bad
right before you die.

1204
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:56,610
You're right.

1205
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,870
Hey, Nicky!
Cover Winkler in bees!

1206
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,530
You can do it!

1207
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,790
Sorry, Henry.

1208
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,630
-Do me!
-With what?

1209
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:09,040
I don't know.

1210
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,720
Here. Kill him with this.

1211
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,760
I'll never forget you, guys.

1212
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:18,760
And we will never forget you,
my friend.

1213
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,860
I love you.

1214
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,780
And I love you, Nicky.

1215
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,490
I got them, Dad! I did it!

1216
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:47,090
Unholiness, you're back!

1217
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,680
You look great!

1218
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,630
It's all in the hips

1219
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,050
It's in the hips

1220
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,220
You're all right!

1221
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,880
You came through, Nicky.

1222
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:01,900
I came through for you, Dad...

1223
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,860
and I came through
for Mom and the butterflies.

1224
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,110
You're back in Hell now, kid.

1225
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:10,150
There are no butterflies here.

1226
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:13,190
If you want butterflies,
you need to be on Earth.

1227
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:19,530
What about you and Grandpa
and everybody in Hell?

1228
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,620
I let my butterflies die
once upon a time...

1229
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:26,130
and it's never stopped hurting.

1230
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:27,670
That's right!

1231
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,460
You heard me, Holly.

1232
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:30,710
What?

1233
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,590
I'm still in love with you!

1234
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,710
Oh, my God,
he's talking about me.

1235
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,140
And don't think I forgot
about how crazy you get...

1236
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,680
after a few daiquiris.

1237
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,030
That guy is still
the biggest horndog.

1238
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,760
Yeah, he is.

1239
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:51,190
Listen, I got down low.

1240
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:54,490
Your mom's got up high.

1241
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:56,360
You take care of the middle.

1242
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:58,620
OK, Dad.

1243
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:03,160
But, in the words
of Motley Crue...

1244
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:07,460
this will always be
my home sweet home.

1245
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,550
Don't be afraid
to show your face.

1246
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:12,050
You're such a handsome boy.

1247
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,470
I hate to interrupt...

1248
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:19,300
but it's time
for Hitler's punishment.

1249
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:21,590
-I'll take that.
-Maybe they'll let us out.

1250
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:22,890
Grandpa!

1251
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,550
OK, kids.

1252
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,650
Enjoy your new home!

1253
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:31,310
Holy shnit!

1254
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:42,620
Such a little angel.

1255
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,110
Only a quarter, ma'am.

1256
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,410
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

1257
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,580
Sorry.
