1
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,500
Let me show you
what I made today.

2
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,870
I can't wait.

3
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,000
I need to go upstairs
and change...

4
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,170
and then I'll start dinner.

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh, yes, it's ladies night,
and the feel--

6
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,330
Showtime.

7
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,990
Rough day at the office,
Mrs Dunleavy?

8
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,210
You'll feel better once you
get out of those work clothes.

9
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,960
And into some sweats.

10
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,170
I wish you'd let me
rub those feet.

11
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,050
Of course,
I wouldn't use my hands.

12
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,560
I think Victoria
just told me her secret.

13
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,790
Deedly dee.
Are those things for me?

14
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,040
Mom, coming in.

15
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,000
Scottie Dunleavy?

16
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,710
What unfortunate timing.

17
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,310
Get out. Don't you know
this is naughty time?

18
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,930
I'll get it.

19
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,680
Hello, Scottie. Why don't you
be a good little boy...

20
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,820
go downstairs
and let your mother get comfy?

21
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,360
Who is this?

22
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,360
This is a big bird who wants
to see the rest of Mommy.

23
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,450
Oh, my God, Scottie.
Is that a man up our tree?

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,540
No, no.
Tell her it's just a big bird.

25
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,900
Hey, pal, welcome.

26
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,320
Welcome to what? Where am l?

27
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,150
Aren't you that horny guy who
was pretending to be a big bird?

28
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,740
Checking out that beautiful mom?

29
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
Yes, I am.

30
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,120
Now you'll see what a big horny
bird actually looks like...

31
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,130
in Hell!

32
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,600
I deserve this!

33
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,090
-Knock, knock.
-Hey, Jimmy.

34
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,790
-What are you doing, Nicky?
-Just jamming.

35
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,970
Your father wants you and your
brothers in the throne room.

36
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,390
He's not retiring today, is he?

37
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,560
He wants to talk to you
and Cassius and Adrian...

38
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,430
about who'll rule Hell
for the next 10,000 years.

39
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,470
Why do I need to go?
He won't pick me.

40
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,900
I happen to think
you'd make a great Devil.

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,150
I'm not into evil and torture
and all that stuff.

42
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,370
Plus, the Prince of Darkness
should look distinguished...

43
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,950
and let's face facts,
I'm no George Clooney.

44
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,370
You're not
a bad-looking guy, Nicky.

45
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,290
Look at that picture.

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
I used to talk normal, too...

47
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,960
before Cassius hit me
in the face with a shovel.

48
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,210
That's me now, and I accept it.

49
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,470
Your brothers are two of
the sickest guys I've ever seen.

50
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,420
For some reason, you're not.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

51
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,140
Their mothers were fire dragons
and mine was a goat.

52
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,770
How do I compete with that?

53
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,480
Your mother was not a goat.
They're just playing with you.

54
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,190
If one of those psychos
gets picked, I'm doomed.

55
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,700
I knew it, Adrian.
He's finally retiring.

56
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,370
Cassius, I've been waiting on
this day for 10,000 years.

57
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,160
If the old man picks me
to take over Hell...

58
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,870
I'll keep torture going 24-7.
No breaks.

59
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,370
Whoa, mama!

60
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,410
You got him right in the eye.

61
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,840
Hey! How's Daddy's
little girl doing today?

62
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,930
I didn't see you guys.
What's up?

63
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,430
Shovel face,
you want to mind-wrestle?

64
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,970
Nah, I'm all right.

65
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,260
I was thinking of chilling out
by the throne for a bit.

66
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,020
I'm going to mind-wrestle you
whether you like it or not.

67
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,940
I have to warn you,
I'm getting pretty good at it.

68
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,780
Then I guess
I can't make you do this.

69
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,940
Mercy. You win.
I give. Game over.

70
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,690
What are you boys doing?

71
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,240
Nothing, Dad. Just hitting
the old punching bags.

72
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,790
Cassius...

73
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,170
didn't I tell you to stay out
of your brother's mind?

74
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,040
I forgot.

75
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,300
Maybe this
will help you remember.

76
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,980
Now, everybody come sit down.

77
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,720
-Hey, Dad.
-Yes, son?

78
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,300
I know you got a lot
on your mind...

79
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,810
but I almost finished that
Monsters of Metal compilation.

80
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,320
I really think it's turning
into a masterpiece.

81
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,270
OK, kid.
We'll listen to it later.

82
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,200
Thanks.

83
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,240
A window.

84
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,620
Hello, Mr Devil.
I like your cape.

85
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,720
I deserve this!

86
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,970
Fellas, this,
as some of you might know...

87
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,220
is my 10,000th year
as Prince of Darkness...

88
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,810
so I think the time has come
to discuss who will succeed me.

89
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,730
-Knock, knock.
-Yes, Jimmy?

90
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,270
Don't forget--

91
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,110
you're shoving a pineapple
up Hitler's ass at four p.m.

92
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,120
This was a very
difficult decision...

93
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,250
because I have
three wonderful sons.

94
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,460
Adrian--so smart, so ruthless.

95
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,950
Wears makeup.

96
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,290
And Cassius--
so strong, so tough.

97
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,590
Don't forget clinically insane.

98
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,710
And Nicky...

99
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,880
such a sweet boy.

100
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,440
But after much thought
and careful consideration...

101
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,070
I've decided that the ruler
for the next 10,000 years...

102
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,990
is going to have to be...

103
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,610
me.

104
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,490
-What?
-Hallelujah!

105
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,280
I mean, that sucks!

106
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,990
The important thing
for the stability of our rule...

107
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,870
is to maintain the balance
between good and evil...

108
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,670
and I don't think any of you are
ready for that responsibility.

109
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,040
Dad, this is bullshit!

110
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,430
I don't like that language.

111
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,210
Right. Send him in.

112
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,310
Sorry, boys.
I have to get back to work.

113
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,260
It was good
hanging with you, Dad.

114
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,720
I'll check you later.

115
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,330
You're serious?

116
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,590
Off, off, off!

117
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,050
Damn!

118
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Twenty thousand years ago,
Grandpa Lucifer said...

119
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,650
"It's better to rule in Hell
than to serve in Heaven."

120
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,200
Well, I'm tired
of serving in Hell.

121
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,860
We need somewhere
where we can rule.

122
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,120
Bring it on, big man.
Let's see what you got.

123
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,290
Could you concentrate
for five seconds?

124
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,090
I am concentrating, man.

125
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,670
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,710
After careful consideration,
I must respectfully decline.

127
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,720
I can't stand retirement.

128
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
Just let me win one Super Bowl.

129
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,560
In exchange for eternal
damnation of your soul?

130
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,640
You're much too nice a guy
for that, Mr Marino.

131
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,480
You did it for Namath.

132
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,140
Joe was coming here anyways.

133
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,990
This sucks.

134
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,860
I'll go to the Super Bowl
as an announcer...

135
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
and win myself an Emmy!

136
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,480
That's the spirit.

137
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,660
You're a good Devil, Dad.

138
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,790
I also happen to be a Jets fan.

139
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,250
What do you think about Earth?

140
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,290
We could create
our own Hell there.

141
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,000
Are you saying we go up there
and kill everyone?

142
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,580
Eventually, Cassius...

143
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,170
but first we'd have to corrupt
as many souls as we can...

144
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,880
so when we do destroy them...

145
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,720
Their damned souls will be ours.

146
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,090
It's our time, brother.

147
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,600
This is not good.

148
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,650
Whoa, whoa.
Fellas, what are you doing?

149
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,150
We're leaving.

150
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,780
You can't go through there!

151
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,620
The fire flows in, not out.

152
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,170
You really suck!

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,210
Your Evilness!

154
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,380
Cassius and Adrian
have escaped from Hell.

155
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,670
They went out through the fire
and froze it.

156
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,590
I tried to stop them, sir,
but they overpowered me.

157
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,180
Calm down. Get off your knees.

158
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,640
Thank you for understanding,
Your Wickedness.

159
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,560
You're the man.
I've always said that.

160
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,440
Are there boobs on my head?

161
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,490
Yeah. Big ones.

162
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,660
What's going on, Dad?

163
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,110
I'm going to die, Nicky.
The gates are broken.

164
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,360
No new souls can get in,
so I'll start to deteriorate.

165
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,460
What's with all
those "hoo hoo" noises?

166
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,790
Everything's fine, Pop.

167
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,130
Everything's fine?
Who are you bullshitting?

168
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,260
Last time you said that,
the Renaissance happened.

169
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,960
Please, Pop,
go back to your room.

170
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,430
Can I take him with me?

171
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,130
Sure, Pop. Whatever you want.

172
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,350
Tit-head, go with my father.

173
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,070
Not a damn soul is going
to get through that.

174
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,070
This fire is solid as rock.

175
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,320
We got to get this bad boy
burning again.

176
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,780
To do that,
Cassius and Adrian...

177
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,400
have to come back through
the other way.

178
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,900
So go get them, Dad.

179
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,160
I'm too weak.
The process has already begun.

180
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,120
So go get them, Jimmy.

181
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,880
I'm just a demon.
No Devil blood in me.

182
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,880
I wouldn't last two minutes
with your brothers.

183
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,250
Are you saying it's up to me?

184
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,090
You said no souls
could get through that.

185
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,600
Nicky, are you a soul
or the spawn of Satan?

186
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,180
I never been to Earth, Dad.

187
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,320
I never even slept over
some other dude's house.

188
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,560
The worst thing that could
happen is you get killed.

189
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,200
In which case, boom--
you end up back here.

190
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,660
So I need to go to Earth
and kill my brothers?

191
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,820
No go. They left together
at the exact same time.

192
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,820
They must come back together
at the exact same time.

193
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,870
Here.

194
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,800
Get them to drink from this.

195
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,710
One sip,
and they'll be trapped inside.

196
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,550
Once you've got both of them,
bring it back through the gate.

197
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,720
Let me, sir.

198
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,300
Gross!

199
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,560
He's got less than a week.

200
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,440
Dad, I don't know
if I can do this.

201
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,980
Son, you...

202
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,900
Try your best.

203
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,510
Earth.

204
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,670
It doesn't look too bad.

205
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,770
You were gone ten seconds.
What happened?

206
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,700
I got hit by this big light
attached to a lot of metal.

207
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,790
That's a train, son.
Don't stand in front of them.

208
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,370
I'll have to take a mulligan
on this one.

209
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,710
Please, Nicky,
get back up there.

210
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,040
All right.

211
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll get that for you, sir.

212
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,810
I'm Nicky.

213
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,390
That's terrific.

214
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,780
Now get off the track
and come with me, handsome.

215
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,610
Welcome to Grand Central Station
in New York City.

216
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,780
My name is Beefy.

217
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,900
I'm an old friend
of your father's.

218
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,370
He asked me to help you out.

219
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,750
I just want to find my brothers
and be on my way.

220
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,120
It's not going to be easy.

221
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,920
Your brothers
can possess people...

222
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,090
so they probably
won't look like themselves.

223
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,330
You have to be suspicious
of everyone.

224
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,000
All right, bro.

225
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,720
The jig is up, then.
Get in the flask.

226
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,380
It ain't me, moron.

227
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,130
Sorry.

228
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,270
There's this blind guy outside
you might think is possessed...

229
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,970
but he's just crazy.

230
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,650
Though I cannot see
with these blind eyes...

231
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,190
I know the good Lord
still loves me.

232
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,990
He loves all of his children.

233
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,990
-Why, he loves you...
-That's him.

234
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,080
...and he loves you.

235
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,160
Here he goes.

236
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,660
You make the Lord very nervous.

237
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,880
All right.

238
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,000
-I'm burning now.
-Take it easy.

239
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,540
Hellfire is burning me alive!

240
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,300
He's burning.

241
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,720
The Beast is alive!
He's among us!

242
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,590
Clear the streets!
The Devil is here!

243
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,690
Making friends already.

244
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,940
I don't know
what that guy's problem was.

245
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
It's freezing up here.

246
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,850
You're in the human world now,
kid.

247
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,190
You'll feel a lot of new things
you never felt before.

248
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,490
Let's get you some warm clothes
and hot food.

249
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,910
Put it in your mouth.

250
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,640
Now move your teeth
up and down.

251
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,890
Up and down.

252
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,640
Good, numb nuts.

253
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,820
Now you got to swallow it.

254
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,100
Tilt your head back...

255
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,150
and let the meat
slide down your throat hole.

256
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,690
Easy. Don't choke.

257
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,110
Popeye's chicken
is fucking awesome.

258
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,240
Now eat up.
You'll need your energy.

259
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,630
I got energy up the ying-yang.
Let's save Dad.

260
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,080
Adrian! Cassius!

261
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,500
Oh, boy.

262
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,710
So nice.

263
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
I like your brassiere.

264
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,940
Thank you.

265
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,190
Could you guys maybe
not tell anyone about this?

266
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,650
You got it.

267
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,240
Do you mind maybe not telling
anybody about this?

268
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,110
You got it.

269
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,360
Look, sidewalk equals safety.

270
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,410
Middle of the road equals death.

271
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,670
From now on, I'll just avoid
all moving metal objects.

272
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,630
Great. Now, your father
gave me some deposit money...

273
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,300
for a nice pad
on the Upper East Side...

274
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,920
but I misplaced it.

275
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,140
I'm wasted!

276
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,310
So I found
this other joint for you...

277
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,480
but you're going
to have a roommate.

278
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,350
There's only one thing better...

279
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,560
than drinking
an ice-cold whiskey sour...

280
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,240
on a hot Alabama night...

281
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,860
and that's telling the truth.

282
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,900
I know what you think
about me, Grandma.

283
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,160
You think I'm worthless.

284
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,030
You think I'm a stumblebum...

285
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,990
who ain't never going
to amount to anything.

286
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,670
Well, old woman, you are wrong.

287
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,680
You are wrong.

288
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,880
Hello, friend.
My name is Nicky.

289
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,340
I understand
you are seeking a roommate...

290
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,300
as per your ad
in the "Village Voice."

291
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,260
Would it be possible for me
to fill the slot?

292
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,640
Don't you want
to know what rent is?

293
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,110
Yes. What is rent?

294
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,530
It's 1,200,
split down the middle.

295
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,780
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I rehearse with my partner...

296
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,710
so the living room's
going to be off-limits.

297
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,280
Off-limits.

298
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,080
Aren't you boiling hot
in that outfit?

299
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,250
It's 80 degrees in this hallway.
Where are you from, the South?

300
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,750
The Deep South.

301
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,340
-Why is that funny?
-I don't know.

302
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,470
OK. And sorry, guy,
but no doggies allowed.

303
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,350
Go on. Big day tomorrow.

304
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,280
And don't forget to do that
sleep thing I told you about.

305
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,320
Gotcha.

306
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,740
You're not my brother, are you?

307
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,280
I'm an only child.

308
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,320
You love acting.

309
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,530
I love pissing.

310
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh, my God!

311
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,210
In today's Gospel...

312
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,640
the Lord tells us
how we should live...

313
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,970
if we wish to attain
the splendour of Heaven.

314
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,890
Or something like that.

315
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,680
Jesus this, Moses that.

316
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,640
Abraham hit me
with a wiffle ball bat.

317
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,570
The Lord said a lot of hibbity
jibbity bibbity swibbity.

318
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,900
But...

319
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,620
has he ever really done
anything for any of us?

320
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,170
Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR
in my driveway?

321
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,630
No.

322
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,250
I love that car.

323
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,550
Has the Lord given
any of my enemies the herpes?

324
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,130
No.

325
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,180
The Lord gave my son
the strength to get off drugs.

326
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,810
Ma'am, I know your son...

327
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,900
and, believe me,
he was better off on the drugs.

328
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,320
At least
when he was smoking hashish...

329
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,770
he used to make me laugh
occasionally.

330
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,660
After we tried for many years...

331
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,540
the Lord finally helped
my wife conceive a baby.

332
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,070
Your best friend Fitzy
helped your wife.

333
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,090
He helped her conceive it
all night long.

334
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,300
How about you, Mayor?

335
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,090
Has the Lord
ever done anything for you?

336
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,300
Well, you know, I wished
I could think of something...

337
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,730
but, to be honest with you,
I can't.

338
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,680
I can't think of a damn thing
he's ever done for me!

339
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,070
Kind of makes you wonder
if there even is a Lord...

340
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,270
if there is ultimate punishment
for our so-called sins.

341
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,240
Why don't we just have fun...

342
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,320
and do whatever the Hell
we want?

343
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,120
Let the sin begin!

344
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,540
Let the sin begin.

345
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,500
That was a good one.

346
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,290
This is so much fun!

347
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,010
I never want it to end.

348
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,470
Why should it end?
Who's going to stop us?

349
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,340
Come on. There's ten million
people in this city...

350
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,300
and the clock is ticking.

351
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,850
Let's rock and roll, then.

352
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,480
-Get in the flask.
-I'm not thirsty!

353
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,690
Cassius, I'll show you.

354
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,780
Cassius, get in the flask.

355
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,950
Get in the flask.

356
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,960
-May I help you?
-Get in the flask.

357
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,450
What are you talking about?

358
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,210
I'm talking about
an eight-piece. Let's go.

359
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,760
Look, it's OKfor me
to shit in the street...

360
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,140
but you got to use a toilet.

361
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,420
Nicky, where are you?

362
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,140
Aw, come on.

363
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
What's he doing now?

364
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,510
Just get in the flask.
I got to get Adrian.

365
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,820
Gary's so hairy.

366
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,830
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

367
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,120
All that chasing
and running around...

368
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,960
is making me want
to do the sleep thing again.

369
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,370
Kid, I like your enthusiasm,
but we have to work on...

370
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,830
narrowing down
our list of suspects.

371
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,850
I'm going to check in with
some of my contacts uptown.

372
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,810
Kid's got a lot of evil in him
just begging to come out.

373
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,300
I will eat your heart.

374
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,800
There's our man.

375
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,350
Mr Sleepyhead must have some
major ties to the dark side.

376
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
What's with that guy?

377
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,190
It's got to be one
of his disciples or something.

378
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,910
My man's into
deep nocturnal shit.

379
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,290
I think that Devil guy
just got ripped off.

380
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,670
-Should we wake him up?
-You do it.

381
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,340
Rise and shine, Devil guy.

382
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,210
Some dude stole your shit.

383
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,220
What? Where?

384
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,510
-Which way did he go?
-That way.

385
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,220
Thanks. Give me back my flask!

386
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,640
Did you check out
the dragon mouth?

387
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,230
The Dark Prince is here.

388
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,610
Check out my stuff.
I got a comb only used twice.

389
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,330
I got a pepper shaker.
A silver doodad from Africa.

390
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,370
See something you like, my man?

391
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,210
I would like my flask back.

392
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,620
You calling me a thief?

393
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,830
I'm calling you
the guy who has my flask.

394
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,760
How would I have it
unless I was, in fact, a thief?

395
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,380
-I don't know.
-Now you've done it.

396
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,220
You messed
with my business, bitch.

397
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,890
I would appreciate it
if you kept your voice down.

398
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,390
You going all crazy-eyed on me.

399
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,570
I'll show you some crazy eye.

400
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,190
Look at this.
Come on, let's get busy.

401
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,320
-Excuse me, sir.
-Who?

402
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,190
Does that flask
belong to this man?

403
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,120
You calling me a thief, too?
Damn.

404
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,450
Look, the guy you ripped off
walked by and busted you...

405
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,080
so why don't you just give him
his flask back?

406
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,220
You going to bite me with
your snaggletooth if I don't?

407
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:09,800
No. But that policeman
might have something to say.

408
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,270
Take your dumb-ass canteen,
goofy.

409
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,020
Get your raggedy-ass clothes
and find another corner...

410
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,220
before I show you
what crazy really is.

411
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,720
Fine. I will.

412
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,230
I'm a businessman.

413
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,820
I'll be seeing you
in a few years.

414
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,740
Excuse me.

415
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,240
That was amazing.
I just wanted to thank you.

416
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,660
That's OK.
I get messed with all the time.

417
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,460
When I saw him do that to you,
I just lost it.

418
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,670
I hate when people
take advantage of tourists.

419
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,290
What makes you think
I'm a tourist?

420
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,970
Your accent, maybe.

421
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,840
Well, where are you from?

422
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,050
-The South.
-Really?

423
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,060
The Deep South.

424
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,900
Why are we laughing?

425
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,650
I don't know,
but I was enjoying it.

426
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,320
Your glasses are pretty.

427
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,320
They make your eyes
look big and sparkly.

428
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,120
It's fun looking at them.

429
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,120
My dad's an optometrist.

430
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,460
My dad's in Hell,
and he's falling apart.

431
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,250
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,210
It's really tough
when your folks get older.

433
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,340
I don't know what I would do
if I couldn't save him.

434
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,350
I'm sure a nice Southern boy
like you...

435
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,920
will figure something out.

436
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,350
You want some Popeye's?

437
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,270
No. I had my lunch already.

438
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,190
But I wouldn't mind
getting a gelati.

439
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,140
Could I come with you
to getting a gelati?

440
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,810
If you want to.

441
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,820
-Here you go, pal. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

442
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,240
It's freezing my hands.

443
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,330
-Even with those gloves on?
-It's cold.

444
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,210
-Let me wrap it.
-Please. Thank you.

445
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,500
Gelati.

446
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,830
Better?

447
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,430
Why are you taunting me
with your darkness?

448
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,340
Your evil,
it's stinking up our streets!

449
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,440
The end is near!
We are all going to die!

450
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,650
This town is really
going to Hell lately.

451
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,820
What part of town
do you live in?

452
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,190
I have an apartment.
I'm not sure where.

453
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,120
My dog knows, though.

454
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,860
You have a dog? What kind?

455
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,240
I don't know.
I'd ask him...

456
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,030
but he's uptown
meeting his contacts.

457
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,790
Say "Mr Beefy." Say it.

458
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,170
Mr Beefy.

459
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,740
And I love you!

460
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,080
You go to school?
What's that like?

461
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,420
I go
to Parsons School of Design.

462
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,880
I knew growing up
I wasn't much to look at...

463
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,350
so I concentrated on
making things that are pretty.

464
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,680
You have a nice smell
coming off you.

465
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,230
That's my perfume.

466
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,680
It's called
Comme de Sud Pacific.

467
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,440
I think that's French
for "Coconuts."

468
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,370
That's better than the gelati.

469
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,950
Valerie, it feels like there's
a bunch of butterflies...

470
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,450
flapping around
in my stomach right now.

471
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,200
Is that normal?

472
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,790
Sometimes, sure.

473
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,880
Good, because I was concerned.

474
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,710
Why did they do this to me?
I was good to them.

475
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,970
I can hardly notice. Honest.

476
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,350
I sure hope Nicky's
kicking some ass on Earth...

477
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,760
or we are doomed.

478
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,940
I was the one who created Hell.

479
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,310
I know, Your Hatefulness.

480
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,480
Actually, the credit
belongs to my first wife.

481
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,900
She was the inspiration.

482
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,570
Chewbacca, take it easy,
will you?

483
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,820
You look like my first wife.
Only she had more hair.

484
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,410
In another startling
announcement from City Hall...

485
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,280
Mayor Randolph has,
effective immediately...

486
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,800
Iowered the legal drinking age
from twenty-one to ten.

487
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,050
When an adult goes to Hell,
that's terrific.

488
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,050
But when a child goes...

489
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,850
That's why I'm in this business.

490
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,850
Little Nicky.

491
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,480
-Know what's nice about you?
-What?

492
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,950
I like the way you're happy
just being yourself.

493
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,360
You don't try to act cool.

494
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,110
Thanks much, Valerie.

495
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,410
You know what's nice about you?

496
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,990
Your juicy heart-shaped heinie.

497
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,490
What was that?

498
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,800
I don't know why I said that.
I meant to say that...

499
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,220
I've always dreamt about
having sex with a gross pig.

500
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,100
Can I wash my winky
in your kitchen sinky?

501
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,840
You're a real jerk!

502
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,690
I didn't mean to be.

503
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,940
What the--Adrian!

504
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,480
Dad needs you
to come back to Hell.

505
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,650
So he sent old Shovel Face
to fetch me.

506
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,190
I'm not kidding.
He's in trouble.

507
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,410
So are you.

508
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,790
Hey, Valerie!

509
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,040
What is your problem?

510
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,290
I'm sorry!

511
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:41,130
Adrian, you froze the fire gate,
and Dad is dying...

512
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,050
so get your booty
back home or else!

513
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,010
You can't talk tough, Nicky.

514
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,230
Even the voice inside your head
has a speech impediment.

515
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:54,020
You're going back
because I'm going to make you!

516
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,060
How about this?
I'll stay here...

517
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,690
enjoying my pizza
and my peppermint schnapps...

518
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,650
and you go back.

519
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,110
Adrian, don't!

520
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,580
Cut the crap! This is serious!

521
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,860
Come on!

522
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,540
I was driving to work today...

523
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,380
some bozo in a Cadillac
cuts me off.

524
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
So I followed him.

525
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,290
When he got out of his car,
I run up behind him...

526
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,800
and start bashing his brains in
with this bat.

527
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,590
Did you ever see
"The Untouchables"?

528
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,300
I was De Niro!

529
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,680
What's happened to you, Regis?

530
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,270
The mayor's office today...

531
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,810
along with the New York
Board of Tourism...

532
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,740
unveiled its new motto
to replace "I Love New York."

533
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,450
"I Love Hookers" will now be
the city's catch phrase.

534
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,650
Your brothers are upsetting
the balance...

535
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,400
between good and evil.

536
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,990
What can I do about it?

537
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,040
You can't do jack shit...

538
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
unless you learn
your evil powers.

539
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,580
Go get a soda out of the fridge.

540
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,170
But those are
my roommate's sodas.

541
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,920
"But those are
my roommate's sodas."

542
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,920
Does that sound like a statement
the son of the Devil would make?

543
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,420
All right. Take it easy.

544
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:13,260
You have the power to change
the cola in that can...

545
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,890
into any other liquid.

546
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,690
Engine oil, bat's blood,
moose piss.

547
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,690
You just have to release
the evil within.

548
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,350
Release the evil?

549
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,570
I'm just saying
there's wickedness in you.

550
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,070
I can tell from your snores.

551
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,450
Really?

552
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,820
Release your evil.

553
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,660
Release the evil.

554
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,130
Come on, you can do it.

555
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,130
There it is.

556
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,340
You got it in you.

557
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,760
What are you doing?

558
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,760
I'm going to pretend I didn't
see a dog on the couch...

559
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,690
because my brain just can't
process that right now.

560
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,980
But were you about
to drink one of my Cokes?

561
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,150
No. I was just looking at it.

562
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,700
It's beautiful.

563
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,880
This Coke tastes like Pepsi.

564
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,520
You changed a Coke into a Pepsi?

565
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,100
That was
your big transformation?

566
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Come on, man,
give it up a little.

567
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,520
It was pretty good
for my first try.

568
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,230
Do you care that your brothers
are killing your father?

569
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,560
Yes, I care!

570
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,780
And he is not going to die!

571
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,150
Atta-boy.

572
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,900
I'm freaked out.
My television just blew up.

573
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,280
You're damn right it did!

574
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,370
I mean, really?

575
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,790
I know this is
your living room time...

576
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,740
but could I finish watching
the Globetrotters out here?

577
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,420
It's the craziest game
I've ever seen.

578
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,060
He's walking! Get him a bus!

579
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,230
This is the part I don't get.

580
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,610
Another terrible call.

581
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,900
There's no way
that was travelling.

582
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,320
What's with all the calls?
We haven't lost in 53 years!

583
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,030
Guess what, cornrows?

584
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,780
Technical foul!
You're out of here!

585
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,410
Why's the referee being so mean
to the Globetrotters, Daddy?

586
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,200
I've been watching these guys
play since I was your age.

587
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,790
It's all part of the show, baby.

588
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,210
That guy in the striped shirt...

589
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,720
snapped his fingers
like somebody I know!

590
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,480
Normally the Globetrotters
represent family entertainment.

591
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,530
Who gives a shit?

592
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,190
These kids came here to see
the Globetrotters win!

593
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,660
Ten points off the Globetrotters
on account of the bigmouth!

594
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,910
It's all part of the show, baby!

595
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,750
Hit the half-time buzzer.
I'm tired.

596
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,040
If the second half doesn't
get any better than this...

597
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,500
you can expect
a full-scale riot.

598
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,050
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now time...

599
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,100
for the Globetrotters' half-time
half-court heave-ho throw!

600
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,100
If the contestant makes it...

601
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,190
everyone here
will get a free pizza pie!

602
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,810
I ain't taking the shot.
These people are crazy.

603
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,900
Excuse me. I'll take that shot.

604
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,610
What made you want to see
the Globetrotters today, son?

605
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,530
I came for the beer
and the bitches.

606
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,620
Look who's back from the dead.

607
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,670
Six-six-six! Pickup sticks!

608
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,800
Please welcome Miguel Sanchez
from the Bronx, New York!

609
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,170
What's Nicky doing there?

610
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,340
Trying to capture
his brother in a flask...

611
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,090
and preserve the balance
of good and evil on Earth.

612
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,050
-Did you just talk?
-No.

613
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,770
-Are you Miguel from the Bronx?
-No. I'm Nicky from the South.

614
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,640
Hey, give me that!

615
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,560
You better win these people
some free pizza...

616
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,070
because it looks like they're
about to kill each other.

617
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,150
All right.

618
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,360
Who's that man, Mommy?

619
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,610
I don't know,
but he sure is butt-ugly.

620
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,870
Release the evil.

621
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,660
Too much evil.

622
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,750
I think that ball just blew up,
and, yes, my hair is aflame.

623
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,840
I don't know
what the Hell that was.

624
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,010
-Don't do it again, huh?
-All right.

625
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,970
I command you not to blow up
and go into that metal circle.

626
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,430
Get that crap out of here!

627
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,690
I know you're having fun,
Cassius...

628
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,150
but you really got
to come back to Hell.

629
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,370
Look around you, Nicky.
We're in Hell. The new Hell.

630
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,040
Do it! Do it! Do it!

631
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,800
I was sent here
to take you back...

632
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,170
and that's what I'm going to do.

633
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,260
Don't make me take out
the shovel again, Trick.

634
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,670
I think we're about to see
a Devil showdown.

635
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,550
Dad got sick when you guys left.

636
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,510
I'm glad he's dying...

637
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,100
because it's my turn now.

638
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,270
You're going to wish
you never said that.

639
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,860
Take him to the hole, Nicky.

640
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,820
I mean, woof woof.

641
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,450
Come on, brother, come on!

642
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,620
Come on!

643
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,130
Daddy can't help you!

644
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,770
Enough!

645
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,440
This show gets better
every year!

646
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,280
That was sick.
Who taught you that shit?

647
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,860
Sorry, Cassius.

648
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,450
It must be the Super Devil Juice
Dad gave me.

649
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,910
Super Devil Juice?
Give me that, little girl.

650
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,650
Don't drink out of it, please!

651
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,260
Now that was some straight-up
David Copperfield shit!

652
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,550
Damn you, Nicky!

653
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,930
There ain't no Super Devil Juice
in here!

654
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,140
Hail, Nicky!

655
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,470
We are forever your slaves!

656
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,980
-So your father's the Devil.
-Sí, seòor.

657
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,400
You're a talking dog from Hell.
You guys are who?

658
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,740
A couple of big fans of Nicky
and the work his dad does.

659
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,700
By the way, Nicky,
check this out.

660
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,750
What's Ozzy trying to say there?

661
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,840
John, absolutely nothing.

662
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,630
The Blizzard always
came straight with his messages.

663
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,430
But wrap your minds around this,
gentlemen.

664
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,930
Chicago.

665
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,270
I love this song.

666
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,450
I command you
in the name of Lucifer...

667
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,860
to spread the blood
of the innocent.

668
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,580
Oh, my God, Chicago kicks ass!

669
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,780
That was awesome.

670
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,660
You know, guys,
this cake tastes a little funny.

671
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,750
I dumped a fat sack of reefer
in the mix.

672
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,120
Thought I'd spice up the bash.

673
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,420
-Really?
-What's reefer?

674
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,090
About five hundred bucks
an ounce.

675
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,940
Come on, Nicky, one more time.

676
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,110
I can't. It's starting to hurt.

677
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,700
Come on, you totally got to!

678
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,320
All right, all right. Last time.

679
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,330
Here he goes!

680
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,870
That's insane!

681
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,380
How do you do that?

682
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,340
I used to get messed up
like this...

683
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,510
with my first girlfriend
Heather.

684
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:14,270
We'd get so loopy,
she would forget I was a dog.

685
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,560
-She was a human?
-No. A sewer rat.

686
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,180
Man, that pissed my parents off.

687
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,020
You know, I was in love once...

688
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,110
but she said I wasn't
financially reliable...

689
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,740
and she needed that.

690
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,940
By "she," do you mean "he"?

691
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,620
-No.
-Busted!

692
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,200
Please.

693
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:40,410
How you feeling over there,
Satan Abdul-Jabbar?

694
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,590
A little strange.

695
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,420
I can't stop thinking
about this girl Valerie.

696
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,340
Why? Did she hurt you?

697
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,600
Do you need to cry
on my shoulder?

698
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,170
Easy, Liberace.

699
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,350
Would you grow up?

700
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,300
Liberace.

701
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,180
I was having the best day
with her...

702
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,230
until Adrian made me tell her
she had a heart-shaped heinie.

703
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,650
Maybe you love her.
But what do I know?

704
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,400
I can't even see straight.

705
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,070
Me, too! We got to get going.

706
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,110
You guys can crash here.
I have an extra futon.

707
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,820
That's a big pass, Elton John.

708
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,830
Ozzy starts in 30 minutes.
That'll cheer you up, Nicky.

709
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,330
Yeah, let's roll.

710
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,500
I can't give the Ozz man
the full focus he deserves.

711
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:28,880
Sorry, fellas.

712
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,460
This chick must be
the real deal, then.

713
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,890
-Later, bro.
-Good-bye, John.

714
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,680
-Good luck, Nicky.
-OK, Pete.

715
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,770
You better snap out
of it soon, kid...

716
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,310
because we're going
after Adrian tomorrow...

717
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,020
bright and early.
Night-night.

718
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,070
Yeah, I know.
Get some sleep thing, Mr Beefy.

719
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,580
That is the most horrifying
thing I have ever seen.

720
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,340
Go to her.

721
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,230
All right.

722
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,520
I smell coconuts.

723
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,610
Coconuts.

724
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,210
That dude looks like a lady.

725
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,670
You want to come in?

726
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,090
Actually, I'm looking
for a girl named Valerie.

727
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,010
Valerie Veran?
Two floors up, one window over.

728
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,220
Thanks much.

729
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,340
Good luck
with the nipple rubbing.

730
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,180
I don't need luck. I'm good.

731
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,640
I can see that.

732
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,880
Oh, my God!
Nicky, is that you?

733
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,420
Stay right there.

734
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,510
I will.

735
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,640
What were you thinking
coming here?

736
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,230
I don't know, but it didn't
involve going blind.

737
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,270
Oh, my God! Nicky!

738
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,620
Please don't die!

739
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,030
What are you doing?

740
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,710
I think I'm floating.

741
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,660
Why would you be floating?

742
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:15,420
Maybe it was because
of this cake I ate earlier.

743
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,260
Am I supposed to not be
freaked out right now?

744
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,470
Because I am.

745
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,050
I'm freaked out, too.

746
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,140
The butterflies in my stomach
are flapping around...

747
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,270
in a way I've never felt before.

748
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,640
You got the wrong window again,
man.

749
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,820
Oh, sorry, Nipples. Valerie!

750
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,480
-Nicky, over here.
-I'm coming.

751
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,280
Oh, my God, you made it.

752
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,360
Valerie, I can see again,
and you look beautiful.

753
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,780
Just because you're floating...

754
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,200
doesn't mean I'm going to forget
you giving me the finger.

755
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,780
That wasn't me.

756
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,410
I was being possessed
by my brother Adrian.

757
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,960
What do you mean, possessed?

758
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,210
Remember when I told you
that my father was in Hell?

759
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,460
That's because he's the Devil...

760
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,300
and he wants to keep his throne
for another 10,000 years.

761
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,260
And that pissed off
my brothers...

762
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,140
so they broke
the gates of Hell...

763
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,300
which is making my father
decompose.

764
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:15,100
I love my father very much,
so I came to Earth to save him.

765
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,520
Now I get that Deep South joke.

766
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,030
I don't know
if I should believe you.

767
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,490
You got to believe.
Believe in the butterflies.

768
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,330
Wait. OK. OK, OK, I believe.

769
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,580
Come on. Come back up.

770
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,000
Take my hand, Valerie.

771
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,800
Fly with me.
I can give you the power.

772
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,560
That's
the Empire State Building.

773
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,230
There's Popeye's chicken--
right there.

774
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,860
The Hell Beast is above us...

775
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,240
and I can smell an evil slut.

776
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,200
Whoa, Devil!

777
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,530
Did you do that?

778
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,670
Nobody calls my girl
an evil slut.

779
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,620
Good morning, New York.

780
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,420
This is an "Action News"
special report.

781
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,880
A shocking crime...

782
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,750
results in a record
fifty-million-dollar reward...

783
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,680
for the capture of this man.

784
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,250
His name is unknown...

785
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,960
but his actions have earned him
the label "The Monster."

786
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,890
He should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

787
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,850
The man who caused
such a sensation...

788
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,720
at the game yesterday
is no hero.

789
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,600
He is, in fact, a mass murderer.

790
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,280
-This is real bad.
-Where the heck is Nicky?

791
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,770
I have authorized a reward...

792
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,200
to the person
who brings this man to me.

793
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,490
It's a setup.

794
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,910
Good morning, young lady.

795
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,000
That looks like it tastes great.

796
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,370
Look at that.

797
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,750
Mr Beefy would like you.

798
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,590
Oh, look.

799
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,040
There he is!

800
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,140
Wait. Wait.

801
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,760
What is happening?

802
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,850
There he is!

803
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,520
I'm not a monster.

804
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,410
Release the evil.

805
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,270
Beefy, I think I'm in trouble.

806
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,150
The shit has hit the fan, kid.

807
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,480
Take a look.

808
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,280
This videotape
will show what he did...

809
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,280
after he left the game.

810
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,320
Say hello to my little friend.

811
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,290
My name is Nicky...

812
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,040
and I'm going to kill all
you suckers for no reason.

813
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,620
That's not me! That's
that cockroach Tony Montana!

814
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,170
-Difficult to watch, I know.
-This is Adrian's work.

815
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,970
He superimposed your head
onto "Scarface."

816
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,720
Which is probably DePalma's
third best film.

817
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,930
I'm not Nicky.

818
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,300
Dude, it's us. Let us in.

819
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,010
-John! Pete!
-Nicky!

820
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,190
There's a total mob scene
coming this way.

821
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,230
It looks like they're following
a giant trail of bug shit.

822
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,810
What do we do now, Beefy?

823
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,940
I don't know. This is
a little out of my league.

824
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,950
-What would your dad do, Nicky?
-That's a great idea!

825
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,870
I'll ask him. Kill me.

826
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,280
Are you serious?

827
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,870
Yes. We'll meet
at Grand Central Station, noon.

828
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,080
Now I command you--do me.

829
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:25,540
All right!

830
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,460
That just hurt a lot.

831
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:33,880
Still alive, though.

832
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,220
I've always wanted
to kill someone.

833
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,390
Can I give it a try?

834
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:44,810
Damn you, Kevin Spacey!

835
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,400
You take all my parts!

836
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,650
Hey, you lose--royal flush.

837
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,030
Off with the brassiere.

838
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:56,610
The last time I saw
a pair of jugs that big...

839
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,820
two hillbillies
were blowing on them.

840
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:06,290
Oh, my God, Dad.

841
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,460
Nicky, I got no legs.

842
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,120
I got no hips.

843
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,050
I got one ear.

844
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,340
I got no ears.

845
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,840
Now he has no ears.
Are you happy, Nicky?

846
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,510
Adrian's got the whole city
following me.

847
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,260
I can't hear you, Nicky!

848
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,140
Check one, two. Check one, two.

849
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,520
Put it back on my head!

850
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,520
You got until midnight tonight.

851
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,480
Get your ass back up there,
and save your father. Go!

852
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,150
-I'm going to save you, Dad.
-Go, go, go!

853
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,860
-I'm going to save you!
-Go, then! Move it!

854
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,570
Go, Nicky, go!

855
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,240
Sure you're down with this?

856
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,750
A little nervous. Want to puke.

857
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,790
Hey, hey, fuzz.
We know where to find Nicky.

858
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,220
-Let's go.
-Get in.

859
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:54,840
What's up, Police Chief?

860
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,710
-You have what I want.
-You got what we want?

861
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,170
Fifty million bones, bro.

862
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,270
-Here's the money.
-Whoa, my God!

863
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,800
That's half of it. You get
the rest when I get Nicky.

864
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,470
Thanks much.

865
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,350
I got to warn you, man.
He's kind of not human.

866
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,490
-Really?
-He might be the son of Satan.

867
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,120
I guess I'll have to be
extra careful, then, aren't l?

868
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,540
Now, where is he?

869
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,540
Hey, come on, that was cool!

870
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,170
Do it again!

871
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,130
Out of the way!

872
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,520
Where is he? He's late.

873
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,970
He'll be here.
Just keep your skirt on.

874
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,680
That's where he comes out of.

875
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,520
Over there!

876
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,020
We've been ratted out.

877
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,440
We thought the son of Satan
would understand such a move.

878
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,530
-Get these two out of here.
-All right, this way.

879
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,820
What is this?
A bulldog and his gay lover?

880
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,120
Oh, shut up.

881
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,370
It's true. It's true.

882
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,700
Judas.

883
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,130
Judas Priest, maybe.

884
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,080
I'm only an actor.
I don't know what's happening.

885
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,710
Take him to the holding area.
Seal off all the exits.

886
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,670
I'm only an actor!

887
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:21,750
You want to see something cool?

888
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,550
Definitely.

889
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,780
Pick me a winner.

890
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,240
Oh, sick!

891
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,240
Oh, my God, that was awesome!

892
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,200
So, what time's
my brother expected back?

893
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,700
Noon. Ish.

894
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,000
Even though you're
not really the chief...

895
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,090
we still get the rest
of the cash, right, bro?

896
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,920
You know what you'll get, boys?

897
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,130
An indescribably
horrific torture...

898
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,880
administered by demons
for the rest of eternity.

899
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:04,890
And we get to keep the cash,
too, right?

900
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,430
Sure.

901
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,220
Why not?

902
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,390
You're hurting me.

903
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,020
Shut up.

904
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:25,200
Applesauce every time.

905
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,530
Hey, boys!

906
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,160
You want a blizzard
with my flip-flop?

907
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,580
No, thanks, but we'll take
that bottle of booze.

908
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,250
Beat it, you freak.
Get out of here.

909
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,090
I'll be back with my flip-flop!

910
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:43,590
Schnapps.

911
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:47,880
Peppermint?

912
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,930
All right!

913
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,690
Want a hit?

914
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:57,430
Drink up.
Here's to fifty million clams.

915
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,610
To the defilement of Earth
and corruption of its people.

916
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,070
OK, whatever.
Just drink it.

917
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,560
Cheers.

918
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,250
It's awfully hot down here.

919
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,580
How do you manage
to stay so cool?

920
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,090
Beer lowers
the body temperature.

921
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,340
I read that in a beer magazine.

922
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:34,520
This liquid
will probably quench my thirst.

923
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,810
-Cool me off.
-Definitely.

924
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,600
Give you a pretty good buzz.

925
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,030
Or maybe it will trap me inside
for all of eternity.

926
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,160
No, it won't?

927
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:55,290
Oh, Nicky.
I've missed you.

928
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,630
Come out and say hello!

929
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,550
I'm not Nicky.

930
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:02,080
I'm calling you out, brother!

931
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,880
Adrian, this is very painful.

932
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,230
-There you are.
-I told you he was sick.

933
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,860
Oh, hello, Cassius.

934
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,790
All right, Adrian! Let me out!

935
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,200
New Hell really only needs
one new Satan.

936
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,080
You motherfu--

937
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,660
But Cassius could use
some company for eternity.

938
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,880
So get in the flask.

939
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,540
Kick his ass, Nicky.

940
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:43,750
Sleep.

941
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,630
You got it.

942
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,810
Hey, hold up.
Someone's got to take a pee.

943
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,510
That dog's got smoke balls!

944
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,940
Run, Beefy! Run!

945
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,030
You can't make me drink, Adrian.

946
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:07,570
Of course I can.

947
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,070
Oh, it's Nicky's
little ragamuffin.

948
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,790
Drink or she dies.

949
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,710
Unlike you, she won't come back
from where she's going.

950
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,470
Let go of her!
This is between you and me!

951
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:29,430
I hear a train a-coming!

952
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,510
Adrian, stop!

953
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:35,680
-Drink!
-All right! Don't hurt her!

954
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:37,770
Don't do it, Nicky!

955
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:40,060
I have to, Valerie.

956
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,950
Now, that hurt the both of us.

957
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,840
See you in Hell!

958
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:18,230
Hey, look at the bright side.
You can go for a swim.

959
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,480
You can play the harmonica,
and you can choke someone.

960
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,020
Take me to my room.
I want to be alone!

961
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,390
In your weakened condition,
if you vacate the throne...

962
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,530
any of your sons can claim
the seat of power for their own.

963
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,730
Horseshit.

964
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,940
Hey, good news.
Adrian's back.

965
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:35,740
I'm going to be all right?

966
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:38,410
Where's Nicky?

967
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,330
He came with you and Cassius,
right?

968
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,290
I came through that gate alone.

969
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,330
Sorry, sir. False alarm.

970
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,380
Would everyone stop
playing with me...

971
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,080
and tell me
what my brother's up to?

972
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,270
What is this?

973
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,240
Is it Dad's birthday?

974
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,800
There he is.

975
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:39,090
Hi! I can't believe you're here!

976
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,390
Welcome.

977
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:42,390
Up with the sign.

978
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,930
Can I just tell you
I am so excited right now?

979
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,690
-So excited!
-She really is.

980
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,700
If you could point me
to the Black Palace...

981
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,650
I really got to check in
with my dad.

982
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:59,320
Can I ask you something?

983
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,330
What do you know about your mom?

984
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,070
My mom.

985
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,830
My brothers tell me
that she was a mountain goat...

986
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,620
which would explain
my chronic halitosis.

987
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,050
A mountain goat?
That's really sweet.

988
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:13,620
Jenna, chair.

989
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:16,720
Thanks.

990
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,890
My mother wasn't a goat?

991
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,220
Try an angel.

992
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:25,940
An angel?

993
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,640
I'm your mom.

994
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:35,150
If you're my mom,
then how come you're not older?

995
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,570
Angels don't get any older, son.

996
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,790
I can't believe
you just called him "son."

997
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,570
This is so wild!

998
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:51,210
Jenna, Christa.
Time for your mambo lesson.

999
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:54,130
Chubbs, I'm so sorry.
I totally spaced.

1000
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:56,500
I have company.
This is my son Nicky.

1001
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,090
Chubbs used to be a golf pro...

1002
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,350
but up here he's just
the dopest dance instructor.

1003
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:03,640
Ah, that's nice.

1004
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,100
You mambo?

1005
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,510
I don't think so.

1006
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,730
It's all in the hips.

1007
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,280
-Bye, Chubbs.
-All in the hips, yeah!

1008
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,230
Nobody in this room
will tell you a thing, Adrian.

1009
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,780
Right!

1010
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:19,990
Hey, let him go!

1011
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:25,040
Perhaps a titty-twister
will loosen your lips.

1012
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:27,660
I'm getting turned on.

1013
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,450
All I know is that if you
sit on that throne...

1014
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,580
in your father's
weakened condition--

1015
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:33,750
Tit-head, no!

1016
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,580
You can claim the seat of power
for your own.

1017
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,430
Really?

1018
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,220
As the founder of Hell...

1019
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,760
I command you
to stay off that throne!

1020
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,520
Even in Hell I get no respect.

1021
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,940
Put me down!

1022
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,250
So where did you meet Dad?

1023
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,800
It was a long time ago
at this Heaven-Hell mixer.

1024
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,800
I remember that night.
You had, like, four daiquiris.

1025
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,130
At first
I didn't really like him.

1026
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,010
-He was really conceited.
-But he was funny.

1027
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,390
And I hate to admit it,
but he had a really hot body.

1028
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,980
Puppy phone.

1029
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,440
It's so cute.

1030
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,150
Hi, Michelle.
Yeah, he's here right now.

1031
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,940
I don't know if he's hot.
He's my son, you perv.

1032
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,650
Can I call you back?

1033
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,330
That was my friend Michelle.
She says hi.

1034
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,160
Say hi back.

1035
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,200
I'll just call her later.

1036
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:54,240
We totally saw you
save your girlfriend's life.

1037
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:55,330
That was so cool.

1038
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,620
That's why you came to Heaven
instead of Hell.

1039
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,750
Self-sacrifice
automatically gets you here.

1040
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,250
How did you see me?

1041
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,640
We can see anything
that's going on on Earth. Look.

1042
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,090
Someone else is taking
the internship.

1043
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,800
That's "Felicity."
I love that show. Do you watch?

1044
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,560
I haven't seen it,
but I hear good things.

1045
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,650
This is an "Action News"
special report.

1046
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:20,230
Moments ago, a large chunk
of what appears to be Hell...

1047
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,070
began to rise
from beneath Central Park.

1048
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:25,280
Far from being terrified...

1049
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,740
many New Yorkers have begun
flocking to the site...

1050
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,830
turning it into an unofficial
party central.

1051
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,620
And this just in...

1052
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,580
I'm cheating on my husband
with the weatherman.

1053
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:40,000
Show him Central Park.

1054
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:41,840
I love your legs.

1055
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,900
That's my father's throne!

1056
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,240
-Is Dad OK?
-Let's see.

1057
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,660
I was a good Devil, wasn't l?

1058
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,280
You were the best Devil, sir!

1059
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:13,240
If we fall in there,
we will die. Period.

1060
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,460
My underwear is so far up my ass
I could taste it.

1061
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,750
I hear that.

1062
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,420
Welcome to the party!

1063
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,210
It's so nice
to see you all here.

1064
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,920
I'm so proud of you.

1065
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:34,140
You've taken to sin
with such minimal prompting.

1066
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:40,390
You're acting as if
there is no Heaven or Hell.

1067
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,480
Well, I've got news for you.

1068
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,700
There is most definitely a Hell.

1069
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:54,950
What?

1070
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:58,540
And you're all
going there when you die.

1071
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,250
Which is in about
fifteen minutes.

1072
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,550
Holy shit,
we really are going to die!

1073
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,590
I'm really burning now!

1074
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,640
What are we going to do?

1075
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:18,560
I got to help her.

1076
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,730
I got to help Dad.

1077
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:22,940
I got to help everybody.

1078
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,350
At the stroke of midnight...

1079
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:27,530
my father will be
completely deteriorated...

1080
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:31,160
and all your souls will be mine.

1081
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:32,950
Soon you will see things...

1082
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,490
more horrible
than you can even imagine.

1083
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:42,210
Well, maybe not that horrible,
but still pretty bad.

1084
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:45,010
So, while we wait...

1085
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:46,800
for your enjoyment...

1086
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,380
I bring you a dear, sweet man--

1087
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:52,380
Mr Henry Winkler.

1088
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,510
Good evening.

1089
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,680
Covered in bees!

1090
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,150
How can I win?

1091
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:06,650
Adrian is stronger
and smarter than me.

1092
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,860
Stronger, yes.

1093
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,950
Smarter, definitely.

1094
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,280
But you have something
that he doesn't have.

1095
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,990
A speech impediment?

1096
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,870
The inner light, honey.

1097
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,710
And you can totally use it.

1098
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,740
-It's the best power of all.
-I do?

1099
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:26,170
And God told me if you
get in really bad trouble...

1100
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,010
you can use this.

1101
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,180
What is it?

1102
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,180
I'm not totally
a hundred percent on that...

1103
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,310
but God said when the time came,
you'd know what to do with it.

1104
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,630
God's so smart.

1105
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,730
Like "Jeopardy!" smart.

1106
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:42,930
My little boy.

1107
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,070
Mommy,
get me to the Big Apple...

1108
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:49,690
because I'm going to
rock that town like a hurricane.

1109
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,490
You're already there.

1110
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:52,950
Bye, Nicky.

1111
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,820
Bye, Mom.

1112
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,750
Bye, guys.

1113
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,960
Release the good.

1114
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,930
Yes, they're furry.

1115
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,220
Bunny, bunny, bunny!

1116
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,850
Release the awesome.

1117
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:33,070
What you do is put it
in your mouth...

1118
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:37,660
and let the meat slide down
your throat hole.

1119
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,080
Not you, not you!

1120
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:48,090
Popeye's chicken
is the shizzney!

1121
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,900
You know, from this angle,
you're kind of cute.

1122
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,560
You think so?

1123
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,400
Oh, my God.

1124
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,110
He just opened his mouth
and swallowed that spit.

1125
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:21,410
That turn you on there, RuPaul?

1126
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,910
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1127
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,670
Little Nicky.

1128
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,760
I knew you would make it!

1129
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:39,550
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely.

1130
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,310
Let my friends alone...

1131
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:44,760
and get in the flask.

1132
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:46,010
Is this a joke?

1133
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,110
No, it's the inner light...

1134
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,270
and with it,
we can defeat whatever you got.

1135
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,980
It's true!

1136
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:58,410
It's not true!

1137
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:02,990
Run, traitors, run!

1138
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,790
OK, Adrian.

1139
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:08,000
You've left me no choice.

1140
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,810
Leave this to me.

1141
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,970
Let's see what you've got.

1142
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:12,890
Enough!

1143
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,200
I'm going to kill you
with my bare hands.

1144
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,940
I'm ready for you.

1145
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,940
I guess I wasn't ready.

1146
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,750
-I totally had to do that.
-Hell, yeah!

1147
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,130
-Good job!
-That's great!

1148
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:41,010
Thanks, Mom !

1149
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:50,310
I'm going to ask you nicely.

1150
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,680
Get in the fla--

1151
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:55,940
You want a pillow fight, do you?

1152
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,890
Let's let the feathers fly.

1153
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,690
Come on, now.

1154
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,360
Come on.

1155
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,330
I'm right here.
Where am I going with it, baby?

1156
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:12,820
Here I am.

1157
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:17,700
I'm sleeping.

1158
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:19,340
Or am l?

1159
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:24,340
Thanks, Mr Winkler.

1160
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:27,100
I'm asking you one last time.

1161
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,600
Get in the flask.

1162
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,940
A little help here, please.

1163
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:35,190
Please!

1164
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:38,270
Don't do this! No!

1165
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,700
Good-bye, Nicky.

1166
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,780
Nice to see you, brothers.

1167
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,050
Now I'm going to bust
both of your heads wide open!

1168
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,800
-Come on!
-Get 'em, Nicky!

1169
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,260
Come on, Nicky!

1170
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:13,590
You can do it, Nicky!
Kick him in his hairy balls!

1171
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:15,520
Good idea.

1172
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:18,930
One down, one to go, Adrian.

1173
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,310
You've asked for this.
Time for the shovel!

1174
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,650
Bring it on!

1175
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,270
-Kill him, Adrian!
-Shut up!

1176
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,700
-Get him, Nicky!
-Let go of me!

1177
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:03,690
How did a nice Southern boy
learn to fight like that?

1178
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,160
I guess from my father's side
of the family.

1179
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,170
What? No tongue?

1180
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,380
Catch me if you can!

1181
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:37,020
That is wicked!

1182
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,480
Not long now!

1183
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:49,270
You got to fly out.

1184
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,120
Soon it will all be mine!

1185
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,450
Nicky! I know you can do it.

1186
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:54,910
Run, run!

1187
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:56,750
Do it for the butterflies.

1188
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:58,830
Butterflies?

1189
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,880
The power of good
lets you fly out.

1190
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,800
Well, you're too late, Nicky!

1191
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,600
Behold your new Satan!

1192
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:17,310
What's that?
What's with the ball?

1193
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,520
-Ozzy?
-Holy shit.

1194
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,190
No, no, no!

1195
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:30,070
You can do it, Ozzy!

1196
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:32,660
Bite his fricking head off!

1197
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:37,030
Spit him in the flask!

1198
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,530
Here you go, Ozzy.

1199
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:46,590
-Grand Central, Nicky!
-Start running.

1200
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:48,300
-You'll never make it.
-You've got to die.

1201
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,880
I'll just go to Heaven.

1202
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:52,880
Not if you do something bad
right before you die.

1203
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:54,210
You're right.

1204
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,470
Hey, Nicky!
Cover Winkler in bees!

1205
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,130
You can do it!

1206
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,390
Sorry, Henry.

1207
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,230
-Do me!
-With what?

1208
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:06,640
I don't know.

1209
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,320
Here. Kill him with this.

1210
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,360
I'll never forget you, guys.

1211
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:16,360
And we will never forget you,
my friend.

1212
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:24,460
I love you.

1213
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,380
And I love you, Nicky.

1214
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,090
I got them, Dad! I did it!

1215
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:44,690
Unholiness, you're back!

1216
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,280
You look great!

1217
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:49,230
It's all in the hips

1218
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,650
It's in the hips

1219
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:55,820
You're all right!

1220
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:57,480
You came through, Nicky.

1221
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,500
I came through for you, Dad...

1222
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,460
and I came through
for Mom and the butterflies.

1223
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,710
You're back in Hell now, kid.

1224
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:07,750
There are no butterflies here.

1225
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,790
If you want butterflies,
you need to be on Earth.

1226
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:17,130
What about you and Grandpa
and everybody in Hell?

1227
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,220
I let my butterflies die
once upon a time...

1228
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,730
and it's never stopped hurting.

1229
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,270
That's right!

1230
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,060
You heard me, Holly.

1231
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:28,310
What?

1232
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,190
I'm still in love with you!

1233
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:32,310
Oh, my God,
he's talking about me.

1234
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:35,740
And don't think I forgot
about how crazy you get...

1235
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,280
after a few daiquiris.

1236
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,630
That guy is still
the biggest horndog.

1237
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,360
Yeah, he is.

1238
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:48,790
Listen, I got down low.

1239
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,090
Your mom's got up high.

1240
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:53,960
You take care of the middle.

1241
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:56,220
OK, Dad.

1242
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:00,760
But, in the words
of Motley Crue...

1243
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:05,060
this will always be
my home sweet home.

1244
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,150
Don't be afraid
to show your face.

1245
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:09,650
You're such a handsome boy.

1246
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,070
I hate to interrupt...

1247
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,900
but it's time
for Hitler's punishment.

1248
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:19,190
-I'll take that.
-Maybe they'll let us out.

1249
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,490
Grandpa!

1250
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,150
OK, kids.

1251
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,250
Enjoy your new home!

1252
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:28,910
Holy shnit!

1253
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:40,220
Such a little angel.

1254
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,710
Only a quarter, ma'am.

1255
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:46,010
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

1256
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,180
Sorry.
