1
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,470
They found another one.

2
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:17,205
There's going to be no treasure left

3
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,769
by the time she gets here!

4
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:19,940
Mark the location!

5
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,881
That's the Frenchman!

6
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,546
And over there, Kristos.

7
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:26,645
They're all coming.

8
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,519
All except one.

9
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,685
All right, follow Kristos.

10
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:32,819
When he dives,

11
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:33,953
we dive.

12
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,019
Maybe we'll get lucky

13
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:37,190
and find whatever it is that's down there.

14
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,826
Hey, look at that, Jimmy. Look.

15
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:43,701
Why isn't she slowing down?

16
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:53,642
- You were asking?
- I knew it.

17
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:58,886
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

18
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,497
Hello, boys.

19
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,197
You're all wet.

20
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,069
Half the world's raiders are already here

21
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:21,234
and you make us wait.

22
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,904
But you know I can't resist a bit of fun.

23
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:27,011
Huh.

24
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,072
Lara, tell us,

25
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,445
what's all this fuss about?

26
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,145
What does everybody think
is down there?

27
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,767
Well, I don't know what everybody
thinks is down there,

28
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:36,682
but... I think
it's the Luna Temple.

29
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,784
The Luna Temple?

30
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,386
My sons, if it's not on television,

31
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,522
forget it.

32
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,361
It's a temple built
by Alexander the Great.

33
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,230
Who was Greek,
in case you don't know.

34
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,009
Yeah, yeah.

35
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:49,037
Alexander collected treasures
from all over the world.

36
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,101
He stored them in two places.

37
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,208
The majority went to his library in Egypt,

38
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:57,371
but his most prized possessions

39
00:04:57,446 --> 00:05:00,813
went here - the Luna Temple.

40
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,716
By law, no one was allowed
to record its location.

41
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,413
And in 330 B.C. It was...

42
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,978
...swallowed by the sea.

43
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,219
Destroyed during a volcanic eruption.

44
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,418
Lost forever.

45
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:13,792
Until yesterday.

46
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:14,955
Ah.

47
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,395
If even half the temple

48
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:20,239
is intact, it will still be the greatest
find since the pyramids.

49
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:23,896
The others head into this area here
along this shelf.

50
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,444
- And that's based on the currents?
- Yes.

51
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:28,068
Ah. This, Gus,
was why I was late.

52
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,507
Oh.

53
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,672
It's a geological,
taken two hours after the quake.

54
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,842
The epicenter was here
five miles northeast of us.

55
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,251
But look at the currents
along the shelf now.

56
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,882
Wait. They've shifted.

57
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,519
So, while they're all diving there,

58
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:49,086
the ruins will actually be...

59
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,293
Here.

60
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,971
Let's go.

61
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,123
Something wrong?

62
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,420
First, Alexander doesn't record
the temple's location.

63
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:26,059
Then God wipes it from the Earth
with a volcano.

64
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:30,002
Now even the currents change.

65
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:34,338
Lara, maybe this temple's
not meant to be found.

66
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,937
Everything lost is meant to be found.

67
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,244
Don't worry.

68
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,102
Incredible!

69
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:50,771
It's unbelievable!

70
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:51,778
Whoo!

71
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,075
Oh, my God.

72
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:55,582
This is huge.

73
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,186
Wonderful.

74
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,025
Jimmy, this is wonderful.

75
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,324
Do you see what I see?

76
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:10,990
Oh, my God.

77
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:14,035
- Oh, my God.
- It's incredible.

78
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,865
Nicky, look at this.

79
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,929
We're going to be rich.

80
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,571
Hey, Lara,

81
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,840
what do you say
to two handsome Greek partners?

82
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:29,645
Well, when you find two,
let me know.

83
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:31,049
Hey, she's talking about you.

84
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,747
No, you.

85
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,358
Pack the gold coins.

86
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,484
Give me that.
Give me that.

87
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,690
Lara, what is that?

88
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:21,361
It's mine.

89
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,306
What is she doing?

90
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:01,943
Lara, that column is collapsing!

91
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,015
Aftershock!

92
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,248
I think that's a sign to leave!

93
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:15,813
Two minutes.

94
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,016
Lara, we need to leave now!

95
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,651
We've got to move!

96
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:30,870
Keep packing.

97
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,099
This thing is gonna collapse!

98
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:33,105
You take those two.

99
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,836
We have to hurry up!

100
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,845
We've got to go.
We've got to go now! Come on!

101
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,346
Okay.

102
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,649
Lara!

103
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:35,436
Lara!

104
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,772
Lara, it's us.

105
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,472
Hillary and Bryce!

106
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:42,207
She's disorientated.

107
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:43,808
That's normal after three days.

108
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:46,319
Nice day for a dip?

109
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,558
Gentlemen...

110
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,185
there is an expression:

111
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:57,526
"It's not nice to fool Mother Nature."

112
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,844
Yet that is precisely what I've been doing
for some time now.

113
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,007
Whether it be sarin gas
for Mr. San...

114
00:17:08,076 --> 00:17:12,567
improved typhoid for Mr. Krev to use
in the Balkans...

115
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:14,344
enhanced cholera for Mr. Duvalier.

116
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,974
But...

117
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:19,043
while these weapons serve their purpose,

118
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:21,849
there have always been limitations.

119
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:25,381
Stable diseases aren't lethal.

120
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,452
Deadly ones burn out too quickly.

121
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,024
Mother Nature can only be fooled
so much.

122
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,568
Deploy my weapon,

123
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,537
and your enemies, however great

124
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:39,767
will collapse from within.

125
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:48,338
Rather like Mr. Monza is collapsing right now.

126
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,817
What the hell is going on?

127
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,227
Monza told Ml6 about this meeting.

128
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:04,663
That's why the change of location.

129
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,133
He was going to turn me over to them

130
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,432
and then seek asylum in the West.

131
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,232
A smart man would have
known I was on to him.

132
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,904
He would never have got on the plane.

133
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,810
But I knew you would, Mr. Monza,

134
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:22,679
because you actually thought
you could fool me.

135
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,753
That, gentlemen,

136
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:32,554
is the sound of a traitor dying.

137
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,195
That was an accelerated form of Ebola,

138
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:46,069
deadliest disease known to man.

139
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:48,802
Highly contagious.

140
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:52,745
However...

141
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:54,714
as with all known diseases,

142
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:58,776
there exist stockpiles
of antiserum in the West.

143
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:31,181
There is no antiserum for
what I am offering you.

144
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:32,913
No treatment.

145
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,046
No vaccine, no cure.

146
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:35,953
The modern world has never seen

147
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:38,015
anything like what I've uncovered.

148
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,219
"Uncovered"?

149
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,421
Yes, I've branched out.

150
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:43,760
Archaeology.

151
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:48,701
Zero-seven-seven-four-four

152
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,761
six-eight-one.

153
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,400
That is the account
at the largest bank in Bern.

154
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:58,037
$100 million each, if you please.

155
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,096
Where's Chen Lo?

156
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,935
He's got the orb,
but Ml6 is on to him.

157
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:26,996
How?

158
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:30,160
He doesn't know,
but rather than riskbringing it here,

159
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:30,906
he's waiting.

160
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,669
I have just told a cabin full of
men about Pandora.

161
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:36,410
The clock cannot be reset.

162
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:39,282
Tell Chen Lo to bring
the orb to me at once.

163
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,038
You'll find the killers!

164
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,870
Don't take it out on me!

165
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,087
Bryce! What have we got?

166
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,958
Well, I haven't even finished
loading the images

167
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,224
from your camera yet.

168
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:29,899
What about references to an orb?

169
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:31,939
I took the liberty of checking.

170
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:33,564
Historical inventories of the Luna Temple

171
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:34,573
do not list any orb.

172
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:36,439
Then I want you both to list

173
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:39,207
every orb ever mentioned
in Greek history.

174
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,440
Every one?

175
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:52,023
That's...

176
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:54,084
liable...

177
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,844
to be...

178
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,428
...thousands.

179
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:06,440
Then we'll read thousands.

180
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:10,468
Start with that one.

181
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:08,958
Perhaps you gentlemen would
like some tea while you wait?

182
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:10,470
No, they wouldn't.

183
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:13,336
Tea is for guests.
The door is for intruders.

184
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:17,241
Lara, these men are from Ml6.

185
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,336
Yes, I can tell

186
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,711
from their soft hands and pressed suits

187
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,682
that these are the men
who make decisions

188
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,717
and leave the dirty
work for others.

189
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:25,514
I have no interest in...

190
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,020
His name's Chen Lo.

191
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,033
Along with his brother Xien,

192
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:32,579
he runs a ring of Chinese
bandits known as the Shay-Ling.

193
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:35,340
They deal in guns,
diamonds, antiquities,

194
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:37,324
anything that Chen Lo can sell
on the black market.

195
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,592
They followed you from the moment
you arrived in Santorini,

196
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,862
where they killed your friend,
Gus, and sank his boat.

197
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:42,868
Why?

198
00:23:42,937 --> 00:23:43,995
For this.

199
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:46,097
After you were picked up at sea,

200
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:48,505
our listening post in Malta
intercepted that fax.

201
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:52,273
It was sent from Chen Lo
to a man named Jonathan Reiss.

202
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,111
What, the scientist?
Won the Nobel Prize.

203
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,445
He's now the foremost designer

204
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:58,041
of biological weapons in the world.

205
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,074
His creations have been at the heart

206
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,450
of every act of bioterror
in the past 15 years.

207
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:05,253
Reiss's disdain
for life is legendary.

208
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:06,850
He has no political agenda.

209
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,362
He doesn't care
who his weapons kill, or why.

210
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,857
A modern-day Dr. Mengele.

211
00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:20,404
We know Chen Lo followed you
in order to obtain the orb,

212
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,272
but we also know that
he'll deliver Reiss.

213
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:23,833
What we don't know is why.

214
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:25,572
Candidly, that terrifies us.

215
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:28,445
Reiss is not to be trifled with.

216
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:30,609
Pandora's box.

217
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:37,215
Reiss is going to use the orb
to find Pandora's box.

218
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:40,083
Do you mean the Greek myth?

219
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,959
Pandora's given a box by God,
told not to open it.

220
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:45,431
She does and unleashes
pain into the world?

221
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,901
That's the Sunday school
version, yes.

222
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,961
How do you think life began?

223
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,303
Shooting star,
primordial ooze?

224
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:56,773
In 2300 BC, an Egyptian pharaoh

225
00:24:56,844 --> 00:25:00,150
found a place that he named
the Cradle of Life,

226
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:02,440
where we, life, began.

227
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:04,815
And there, he found a box,

228
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:06,410
the box which brought
life to Earth.

229
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:07,977
The pharaoh opened the box,

230
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:10,752
but all that was left inside
was the Ramante, or anti-life.

231
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,901
The plague which came as
the companion to life.

232
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:14,895
Companion?

233
00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:16,759
Nature is about balance.

234
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:18,059
All the world comes in pairs.

235
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,464
Yin and Yang. Right and wrong.
Men and women.

236
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:21,559
What's pleasure without pain?

237
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:22,830
What did this plague do?

238
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,838
It leveled the pharaoh's army.

239
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:28,572
The pharaoh's son dispatched
his finest soldier

240
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:31,240
to take the box and transport it
to the end of the world.

241
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:37,314
2000 years later, Alexander
the Great reached India,

242
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:41,037
where his army was ravaged
by a plague,

243
00:25:41,246 --> 00:25:44,232
after one of his men found
a box among some remains.

244
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,087
India? That's where
the pharaoh's man brought it?

245
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:50,089
Alexander felt that the box
was too powerful

246
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:51,237
to be trusted to any man,

247
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:53,399
so he returned it to its home
in the Cradle of Life.

248
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:57,069
And it has never been seen since.

249
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,606
And this... Cradle of Life
is where?

250
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:01,005
No one knows.

251
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:03,407
Alexander found it using
a map that was with the box.

252
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,776
A map he then hid from the world.

253
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:08,611
But the name he gave
this map was Mati.

254
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:12,847
And the literal translation
for the word "Mati" is "eye."

255
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,550
The orb is the map,

256
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:18,251
hidden in the Luna Temple
by Alexander.

257
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:21,318
And Reiss will use it
to find Pandora's box.

258
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:23,796
And when he does,
when he opens it,

259
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:27,034
he will unleash a weapon more powerful
than you could ever imagine.

260
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:34,871
The markings definitely form
a pattern, but...

261
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:36,705
even if I figure out
what they represent,

262
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:38,424
we still can't read the whole map,
because...

263
00:26:39,462 --> 00:26:40,610
we've only got a partial view of it,
you see?

264
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:43,081
Well, we have to figure out
how to read it.

265
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,652
Right. Thank you.

266
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,948
On behalf of Her Majesty,

267
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:48,613
we formally request that you find

268
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:50,589
and recover this box before Dr. Reiss.

269
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:54,854
Well, now that I have
Her Majesty's permission...

270
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,625
Tell me where to find the orb.

271
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:00,132
Last we heard, it was
somewhere in China

272
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,327
with Chen Lo
and the Shay-Ling.

273
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:02,892
Finding them will be
next to impossible,

274
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,801
but we'll assign two
of our best agents to help.

275
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:07,033
I don't want them.

276
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:08,905
With all due respect, expertise
in archaeology doesn't...

277
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:10,967
I didn't say that
I don't need help,

278
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:14,281
but your agents will never get me
to Chen Lo in time.

279
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:17,311
I need an insider, someone who
knows the Shay-Ling.

280
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:20,753
Their methods, their hideouts.

281
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,517
I need Terry Sheridan.

282
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:25,650
Not in a million years.

283
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:27,523
Not if he were the last man on Earth.

284
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,139
Terry Sheridan

285
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,291
formerly a commander with the Royal Marines,
turned mercenary and traitor.

286
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:36,893
You don't honestly expect me

287
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:39,064
to put that man on the trail
of a weapon

288
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:42,108
he can turn around and sell
to the highest bidder?

289
00:27:57,124 --> 00:27:58,216
Open.

290
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:01,288
I am your host...

291
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:02,954
Armin Kal.

292
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,464
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

293
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:59,078
Croft.

294
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:01,883
Hello, Terry.

295
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,995
So, what do you think
of my new place?

296
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,829
It's not quite Croft Manor.

297
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,905
What? A key to your heart?

298
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:20,600
To a flat in Zurich.

299
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,569
You can pick another city,
if you want.

300
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:26,408
Your record will be expunged,

301
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,504
your citizenship restored.

302
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:28,514
By?

303
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,515
Ml6.

304
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:30,551
Ml6.

305
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:33,018
Now, would that make me Faust...

306
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,748
or the Devil?

307
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:36,050
Well, you can pick one,

308
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:38,751
because Ml6 will also arrange
a new identity.

309
00:29:38,826 --> 00:29:41,056
Oh, yeah?
You think I need their help?

310
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:43,630
Oh, having two faces doesn't count.

311
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:48,257
So, what do I have to do?

312
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,065
You need to take me
to the Shay-Ling.

313
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:51,263
The Shay who?

314
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,738
There's a man named Chen Lo

315
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:55,332
who took something from me,
and I want it back.

316
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:58,332
Yeah, now, is that you or Ml6?

317
00:29:58,367 --> 00:29:59,472
Also, I've arranged for the government

318
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,879
to wire you five million
in sterling when we succeed.

319
00:30:01,949 --> 00:30:04,445
You can call it second-chance money.

320
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,250
Or life insurance, for you.

321
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,878
I don't need any.

322
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:13,893
You and I, working alone?

323
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,657
Well, it's easier
to see through you that way.

324
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,756
So, what if afterwards,

325
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:22,936
Ml6 decides that me back in the world

326
00:30:22,971 --> 00:30:24,297
isn't such a great idea?

327
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:27,773
Then I feel sorry for whomever
they get to come after you.

328
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,107
Do you have authorization
to kill me, Croft?

329
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:37,912
Anytime, for any reason.

330
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:40,579
So, why don't you
just do it, then?

331
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:42,953
What is it they say?

332
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:44,252
"Hell hath no fury."

333
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:45,986
You're not that good.

334
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,121
The Shay-Ling are like ghosts, Croft.

335
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:52,289
They move constantly,

336
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:56,210
and their home is the most remote
mountain region in China.

337
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:57,570
Region?

338
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:00,198
You'll have to do better
than that.

339
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,850
Get me into China,

340
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:17,186
and I'll get you to them in a day.

341
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:19,624
No guns, no money,

342
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,321
no weapons of any kind.

343
00:31:21,395 --> 00:31:24,296
Talk about taking
the fun out of life.

344
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:42,247
The Shay-Ling have spies
all over China.

345
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,341
We have to get into
the country undetected.

346
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:47,114
So, we slip into Beijing,
and we go by truck.

347
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:48,654
Truck? Hmm.

348
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:52,489
I was thinking about something
a little faster.

349
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,032
A little faster?

350
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:04,727
Well, this is a little faster,

351
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:06,705
but the Chinese will track the pod.

352
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:10,743
There won't be any pod to find.

353
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:12,176
Will there be any of us to find?

354
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:21,853
Ready? Now.

355
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:23,048
Ready for what?

356
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:43,975
The ditching was good, Croft.

357
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:45,705
I'll give you that.

358
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,113
But we're never going to find
a vehicle in a place like this.

359
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,553
Oh, it's so lovely to see you.

360
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:02,823
So, is everything ready?

361
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,829
Yes.

362
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,153
Your clothes, guns
and knives are over there.

363
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:12,432
And I took the liberty
of tuning your bike.

364
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:13,438
May I?

365
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:14,474
Yes.

366
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,785
Lara.

367
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,693
Ah, what is the happy couple up to?

368
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,855
Accessorizing.

369
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,593
Where are we on reading the orb?

370
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,636
All maps have a key, Lara,
a scale, a legend, yes?

371
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:44,603
The orb's key, it's not on the orb.

372
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:45,866
It must've been lost.

373
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,805
Or is somewhere in the temple.

374
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,809
Go through every image I took.

375
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:51,970
Start with the ones
near the orb.

376
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:55,106
The key must have been linked
to it in some way.

377
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:57,650
Right. Bye, then.

378
00:33:57,718 --> 00:34:00,482
It's unlike Lara to take a partner.

379
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:02,522
Where are you two going?

380
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,854
We'll take a nice little trip.

381
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:07,826
Breathe some fresh mountain air.

382
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:11,058
Stop by my friends, the Shay-Ling.

383
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,389
The Shay-Ling watch all the roads.

384
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:28,320
We'll have to go around the back.

385
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:29,677
We'll go straight.

386
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,411
Maybe you didn't hear me.

387
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:35,803
The Shay-Ling have men on every road
from here to Lo Yang.

388
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,414
Not every road.

389
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:12,854
A bit rusty, are we?

390
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:14,417
Oh, I think it's coming back.

391
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:17,293
I expected more from a Scot.

392
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:20,646
I don't expect anything
from an Englishwoman.

393
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:22,800
Good, 'cause you're not
going to get anything.

394
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:04,034
Fun's over.

395
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,975
From now on, it's by foot.

396
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:12,445
Best to reconsider that "no gun" rule.

397
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,009
No.

398
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:17,148
Okay.

399
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:27,456
And don't be looking at my ass.

400
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,426
So, where do I fit in?

401
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:31,994
What do you mean?
You're the guide.

402
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:36,478
I mean, when you think back
on the vast scheme

403
00:36:36,513 --> 00:36:37,702
of your
hugely adventurous life...

404
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,474
where do I fit in?

405
00:36:40,547 --> 00:36:42,071
Was I the love of your life,

406
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:43,946
or just another bump
on the road?

407
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:45,883
Was I time well spent?

408
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,545
Four months?

409
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:50,988
More good than bad?

410
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:53,686
Come on, it had to be
more than that, am I right?

411
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,396
You're right.

412
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:59,557
It was five months.

413
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:04,236
- You're laughing at me.
- No, no.

414
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:06,033
At the fact,
I used to find you charming.

415
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:10,000
I am charming.

416
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:38,803
You're late.

417
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:45,501
Tilt your head back.

418
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:47,012
Do it!

419
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:53,880
You might see again
in an hour. Maybe.

420
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:06,698
What's this?

421
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:09,531
It's not there.

422
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:11,036
There's no orb.

423
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:14,197
Is there anything
you can tell me about this?

424
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:31,419
Hello.

425
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,892
I take it you didn't
like your messenger.

426
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:35,155
I didn't.

427
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,390
But I did like the men
I lost in the temple.

428
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:40,160
You underestimated Lady Croft.

429
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:44,364
I underestimated how much
this orb is worth.

430
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:47,669
There's so many horrible
diseases in the world...

431
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:51,006
things we are particularly
susceptible to as children.

432
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,273
You never know
when you could be holding

433
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:55,076
little Shiho or Tai by the hand

434
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:58,583
as a mysterious ailment
ravages their bodies.

435
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:03,646
You kill them, and I will give
your orb to Lady Croft.

436
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:05,191
My men tell me

437
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,454
she is a few miles away
from here, as we speak.

438
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:10,122
I wonder how much she would pay.

439
00:39:10,197 --> 00:39:13,257
I'll pay you an additional
12 million dollars.

440
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,648
It will be yours, once you've
delivered the orb to me,

441
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,972
along with Lady Croft's body.

442
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,030
I don't think you know
where they are.

443
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:23,006
You're impossible,
you know that?

444
00:39:23,076 --> 00:39:26,637
I think you pretended to know,
so I would get you out.

445
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:27,839
This isn't a tomb, Croft,

446
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:29,473
and the Shay-Ling
aren't mummies.

447
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,245
They're killers.

448
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:34,287
But if you don't trust me...

449
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:42,693
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but you're wasting time.

450
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,828
You want to shoot me?
Shoot me.

451
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:51,393
Personally,
I'd rather you do it...

452
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:52,768
than them.

453
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,927
Well, Terry...

454
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,326
what part of
"Never come back again!"

455
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:17,556
Didn't you understand?

456
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,433
You wanted to find
the Shay-Ling.

457
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:26,869
Come on!

458
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,273
The only way to get into their
place is as their prisoners.

459
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,108
Ah, you might have told me
that little gem before.

460
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:34,874
Ah, you would have believed me?

461
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:37,348
Make Chen Lo a better
offer than his buyer.

462
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,078
He'll cross them.

463
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:41,279
Even if his buyer
is Jonathan Reiss?

464
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:45,490
You might have told me
that little gem before.

465
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:31,668
Were you really
going to kill me?

466
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:34,764
Oh, I bet she would have.

467
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:36,536
I have seen her in action.

468
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,077
Didn't Terry tell you?

469
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:43,048
The last time any of us saw him,
he was riding away with a truck

470
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:46,415
full of my Ming vases.

471
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:49,114
And sitting next to him...

472
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:51,918
was his sister.

473
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,719
Well, how is she?

474
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:59,357
You... shouldn't
have come here.

475
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,334
It got me out of prison.

476
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:04,734
Besides, the lady
has a good offer.

477
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,295
Better than Reiss.

478
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:08,671
Really?

479
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:10,004
Should I take it?

480
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:11,567
Take it.

481
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:13,272
Or, better yet,

482
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:15,212
you and I ransom
her and the thing

483
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,113
back to the British for triple.

484
00:42:18,518 --> 00:42:20,247
Let's talk.

485
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,547
Not you, Terry.

486
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:25,648
Lady Croft and I.

487
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:27,660
You wait here.

488
00:42:28,895 --> 00:42:30,522
Catch up.

489
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:32,861
I'll be four minutes.

490
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:35,767
Terrific.

491
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:41,244
There's something
I think you will appreciate.

492
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:55,468
This is the largest group of terra-cotta
warriors I have found.

493
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:59,818
The King of Chin made them
for use in the afterlife...

494
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:03,727
to fend off enemies
he made in this one.

495
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:06,891
Hmm. Sounds like we
could both use a set.

496
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:10,198
I would be happy
to sell some to you.

497
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,671
I hope you're as entrepreneurial
with the orb.

498
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,436
You lost men, I lost men.

499
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,570
I see no reason
we should both lose again.

500
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:22,171
If I want double what
Reiss offered me?

501
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:24,080
Is it here?

502
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:25,083
It's worth a lot.

503
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:26,676
Well, then, if you know that,

504
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:30,096
you know Reiss will also kill you
the moment you give it to him.

505
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,584
And your government will
guarantee my safety?

506
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:33,785
No.

507
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,522
But I will.

508
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:39,690
That must hurt,
saying that to me.

509
00:43:39,766 --> 00:43:42,257
Take the offer.

510
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,940
You presume to give me orders?

511
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:55,777
Take the offer,
before it expires.

512
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:57,373
No.

513
00:43:57,451 --> 00:43:59,612
Then I will have to force you.

514
00:43:59,686 --> 00:44:00,914
Then I will have to kill you.

515
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,393
Has it been four minutes yet?

516
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,065
That was nice.

517
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:07,039
It's too bad
you're on the wrong side.

518
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:10,742
Tell me where the orb is,
and it spares your life.

519
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,520
The flower pagoda, in Shanghai.

520
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,490
9:00 p.m.

521
00:46:20,126 --> 00:46:22,492
This is mine.

522
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:34,136
Now we're even.

523
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:48,454
Now!

524
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,630
Remember that "no gun" rule?

525
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,972
I reconsidered!

526
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:45,442
I know there's a staircase
we could've used.

527
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:14,336
Lara, are you all right?

528
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:15,669
Smashing.

529
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:17,505
I'm on my way to Shanghai,

530
00:48:17,577 --> 00:48:20,341
and I need you to look
at something for me.

531
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:22,745
It was in the Luna Temple
near the orb.

532
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,616
And I'm betting it's the key
to those markings.

533
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:29,814
She's holding some sort
of musical instrument.

534
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,793
It's sound.

535
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,691
That's brilliant.

536
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:37,753
The key must have been linked
to it in some way.

537
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,125
- I'll start decoding the images we have.
- Good.

538
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:41,395
You get us the rest.
Bye, Lara.

539
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:43,766
- Miss you.
- Bye.

540
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,294
Oh, well.

541
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:57,132
Just like old times.

542
00:50:02,143 --> 00:50:03,735
I think that's the first time

543
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:07,303
you've actually smiled
because of me.

544
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:15,515
Why did you do it?

545
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,990
I started thinking.

546
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:20,755
I was tired of doing things
somebody else's way,

547
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:23,661
and it was always going
to be somebody else's way.

548
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:26,632
So, you abandon your men
and betray your country?

549
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:30,102
Leaving my men and my country,

550
00:50:30,204 --> 00:50:33,332
that didn't actually hurt
as much as I thought.

551
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,307
But leaving you did.

552
00:50:38,212 --> 00:50:42,046
You're a hard act to follow, Croft.

553
00:50:46,921 --> 00:50:50,220
You know why you and I get along
so well?

554
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,986
No.

555
00:50:53,728 --> 00:50:55,628
We are two of a kind,
me and you.

556
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,967
We are nothing alike.

557
00:51:01,035 --> 00:51:03,868
I don't think we're alike,

558
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:06,065
but I do think we're a pair.

559
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:10,303
Opposite sides of the same coin.

560
00:51:33,668 --> 00:51:36,000
My men have the roof covered.

561
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,868
Why don't you set down
in the square instead?

562
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,568
That way, my men will also
have things covered.

563
00:51:41,642 --> 00:51:42,973
Okay, fine.

564
00:51:43,844 --> 00:51:45,903
Okay, Sean, let's go!

565
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,749
They're landing in the square.

566
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,550
We're in the wrong position.

567
00:51:55,623 --> 00:51:56,555
Stairs?

568
00:51:56,624 --> 00:51:57,522
No time.

569
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:58,523
- Rooftops?
- No.

570
00:51:58,592 --> 00:52:00,560
I've got a plan.

571
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:01,754
Stay here.

572
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:03,854
Wait for my signal.

573
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:08,294
Here's the money!

574
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:09,859
Come and get it!

575
00:52:17,878 --> 00:52:19,402
Wait for my signal, huh?

576
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,640
Give me that box!

577
00:52:20,715 --> 00:52:22,307
You give me my money first!
Come on!

578
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:23,611
Give me that box now!

579
00:52:23,684 --> 00:52:25,276
No, just toss it.

580
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:26,320
You first!

581
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:37,596
Quick! Get us out of here!

582
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,990
Take us up!

583
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:07,020
Take it up!

584
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:22,774
Go! Run her over!

585
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:38,851
Yeah?

586
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:40,689
We tried it your way.

587
00:53:40,761 --> 00:53:41,887
Now we do it mine!

588
00:53:41,962 --> 00:53:43,827
Bring it to the top
of the pagoda now!

589
00:53:43,898 --> 00:53:45,388
Okay!

590
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:26,005
I got you!

591
00:54:36,183 --> 00:54:38,743
Come on! Come on!
Hold it up!

592
00:54:46,293 --> 00:54:49,023
Come closer!
I can't reach it!

593
00:54:49,096 --> 00:54:50,859
Raise it higher!
Higher!

594
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:56,462
My regards to your brother!

595
00:54:56,537 --> 00:54:57,902
We're too late.

596
00:54:59,607 --> 00:55:02,701
Croft, what are you doing?

597
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:14,645
Take us up!

598
00:55:18,959 --> 00:55:20,017
Move! Go!

599
00:55:27,835 --> 00:55:29,598
Let's go! Move!

600
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,677
I'm getting tired of you
pointing that thing at me.

601
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:46,685
Are you okay?

602
00:55:46,754 --> 00:55:47,948
Never better.

603
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:49,614
Looks like we lost the orb.

604
00:55:51,725 --> 00:55:54,250
Please. You don't think
I'd go vaulting into thin air

605
00:55:54,328 --> 00:55:55,260
for nothing, do you?

606
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:57,263
I put a tracer on the crate.

607
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,130
Got it. Look.

608
00:56:06,907 --> 00:56:08,602
Impressive.

609
00:56:37,187 --> 00:56:38,211
A weapons lab

610
00:56:38,288 --> 00:56:40,256
in the middle of the city?

611
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:41,449
No way.

612
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:43,652
He must've dumped that crate.

613
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:46,321
No, it's here.

614
00:56:46,396 --> 00:56:48,830
One of the buildings?

615
00:56:48,899 --> 00:56:53,829
No. It's exactly
where we're standing.

616
00:56:59,342 --> 00:57:02,607
There's a part of me that always
allowed for the possibility

617
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:04,670
that Pandora's box
was just a legend,

618
00:57:04,748 --> 00:57:07,546
but now I know it's there.

619
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,853
She escaped.

620
00:57:14,925 --> 00:57:17,325
She has no idea where we are.

621
00:57:17,394 --> 00:57:18,656
We take no chances.

622
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:22,164
Have everything we need
to manufacture an antidote

623
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:23,859
transferred to the jet.

624
00:57:27,671 --> 00:57:30,139
I need an out for two people.

625
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:32,903
Mid-city. Soon.

626
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:35,635
What, are you crazy?

627
00:57:38,648 --> 00:57:39,615
Are we set?

628
00:57:39,683 --> 00:57:41,913
Piece of cake.

629
00:58:54,724 --> 00:58:55,748
Hello.

630
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:48,090
So much for easy.

631
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,127
What is that?

632
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:56,094
He's already decoding the orb.

633
00:59:56,168 --> 00:59:57,692
Bugger.

634
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,171
Headset.

635
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:26,831
You've got to get everyone out.

636
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:30,062
What do you suggest,
the fire alarm?

637
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:37,538
Not bad.

638
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:39,975
But that's just the alarm.

639
01:00:40,045 --> 01:00:42,172
There's no danger.

640
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:43,646
Do you think anyone here

641
01:00:43,716 --> 01:00:45,809
is paid enough
to take that chance?

642
01:00:53,892 --> 01:00:55,189
Don't even think about it.

643
01:00:57,329 --> 01:00:58,557
It's her.

644
01:01:02,468 --> 01:01:03,833
Yes?

645
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:09,298
Damn!

646
01:02:17,476 --> 01:02:18,738
I'm glad, Lara.

647
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:20,073
That would've been too easy.

648
01:02:25,017 --> 01:02:26,917
Give me your best.

649
01:02:44,903 --> 01:02:46,393
How's that?

650
01:02:48,073 --> 01:02:49,472
I'm going off-line.

651
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:50,735
No, don't...

652
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:54,910
Thanks.

653
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,811
You're welcome.

654
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:01,583
Hello, boys.

655
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,280
Did you understand
the medallion?

656
01:03:03,355 --> 01:03:04,287
Yeah. Yeah.

657
01:03:04,356 --> 01:03:05,823
The, uh, the markings
are sound waves.

658
01:03:05,891 --> 01:03:07,688
We've translated all the markings

659
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:09,954
from your images, roughly half the orb.

660
01:03:10,028 --> 01:03:11,689
Well, let's complete the set then.

661
01:03:11,763 --> 01:03:14,541
I'll record the rest of the images
and send them to you.

662
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,100
Once you have them,
finish the translation

663
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:19,296
and transmit the sounds back to me.

664
01:03:30,382 --> 01:03:32,475
We need more backup.

665
01:03:48,634 --> 01:03:50,465
Smart girl.

666
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:15,683
Move.

667
01:04:15,761 --> 01:04:17,558
Don't shoot her.

668
01:04:17,629 --> 01:04:19,824
Not until we're sure
the computer has done its job.

669
01:04:21,433 --> 01:04:23,401
Do you honestly believe
you'll be able

670
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:24,992
to control what's in that box

671
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,061
and turn it into another
one of your weapons?

672
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:29,107
Really, Lara, you disappoint me.

673
01:04:29,174 --> 01:04:32,575
Have we received payment
from all the buyers?

674
01:04:32,644 --> 01:04:34,612
No...

675
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,205
you don't want to control it at all.

676
01:04:37,282 --> 01:04:39,614
You're using the buyers.

677
01:04:39,685 --> 01:04:41,209
They'll release it,

678
01:04:41,286 --> 01:04:42,776
thinking it's just another weapon

679
01:04:42,854 --> 01:04:44,617
and the world blames them.

680
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,181
What's left of the world blames them.

681
01:04:49,528 --> 01:04:51,291
Once I've got hold of the virus,

682
01:04:51,363 --> 01:04:52,660
I'll make enough antidote

683
01:04:52,731 --> 01:04:55,325
to protect the best and the brightest.

684
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:56,560
Heads of corporations.

685
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:57,659
Heads of state.

686
01:04:57,736 --> 01:04:59,533
Life will go on.

687
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,868
Don't tell me you've never
looked around and thought,

688
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,498
"Wouldn't the world
be a better place

689
01:05:03,575 --> 01:05:04,872
without some of these people?"

690
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:07,411
Well, I can certainly think of
one person I could do without.

691
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,213
There it is.

692
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:19,086
I'm sorry, Lara.

693
01:05:19,157 --> 01:05:20,920
You would've been
welcome in my world.

694
01:05:20,993 --> 01:05:22,654
Piss off.

695
01:05:22,728 --> 01:05:24,525
Shoot her between the eyes.

696
01:05:24,596 --> 01:05:25,858
No mistakes.

697
01:06:08,907 --> 01:06:10,374
You asshole!

698
01:06:10,442 --> 01:06:13,878
I'm going to get you!

699
01:06:13,945 --> 01:06:15,173
Follow me!

700
01:06:33,899 --> 01:06:35,890
You're mine.

701
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,277
Bingo.

702
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:28,285
Two one-way tickets
out of Hong Kong.

703
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:32,887
Parachutes.

704
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:36,386
Something a little faster.

705
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:40,564
Come on!

706
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:47,860
Our rendezvous point is two and a half,
maybe three miles.

707
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:51,770
You're aware that no one's
ever gone further than one mile.

708
01:07:51,843 --> 01:07:54,107
I am now.

709
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:55,612
This way!

710
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,079
Right, you go first.

711
01:07:57,149 --> 01:07:58,582
No, you go first.

712
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,578
I'll go first!

713
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,127
Holy cow.

714
01:08:17,202 --> 01:08:18,669
Follow her.

715
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:42,019
My friend!

716
01:09:42,087 --> 01:09:43,850
Good to see you.

717
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:03,700
I suppose you want
pay now, don't you?

718
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,470
So what did we agree on, $200?

719
01:10:05,543 --> 01:10:07,033
No, 300.

720
01:11:05,737 --> 01:11:06,829
So this...

721
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,567
...rock is the map?

722
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:15,477
Yes, it is.

723
01:11:15,547 --> 01:11:17,412
I've never seen anything
like it, have you?

724
01:11:19,351 --> 01:11:22,286
And it's the only way
to find that box?

725
01:11:22,354 --> 01:11:25,323
And just think,
you could take it now

726
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:27,085
and walk right out the door.

727
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:30,668
No, window's better actually.
Off the ship faster. Harder to track.

728
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:38,217
Oh, Croft, do you really think
I would do that to you?

729
01:12:17,142 --> 01:12:18,871
You can break my wrist,

730
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,173
but I'm still going to kiss you.

731
01:13:29,979 --> 01:13:33,437
Well, not exactly
what I had in mind, but okay.

732
01:13:35,184 --> 01:13:36,651
Why didn't you shoot Reiss?

733
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,311
What?

734
01:13:38,387 --> 01:13:41,584
He must have walked
right past you in the lab.

735
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,320
Why didn't you shoot him?

736
01:13:45,428 --> 01:13:47,123
I didn't have a clear shot,

737
01:13:47,196 --> 01:13:48,891
and I had no idea where you were.

738
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:51,934
I'll inform Ml6 of the
completion of your service.

739
01:13:52,001 --> 01:13:55,145
You'll have your money and your life.

740
01:13:55,404 --> 01:13:56,735
Don't waste it.

741
01:13:58,009 --> 01:14:00,301
Damn it, Croft,
this is no time to split up.

742
01:14:00,336 --> 01:14:02,442
Yes, it is, before you make
the wrong decision.

743
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:10,014
Okay, you want to leave?

744
01:14:10,086 --> 01:14:11,678
Go ahead.

745
01:14:11,754 --> 01:14:14,245
But don't pretend
it's to try and save me.

746
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:18,530
You're afraid.
Afraid you might not pull the trigger.

747
01:14:18,565 --> 01:14:19,853
Afraid of letting your guard down,

748
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:22,193
of letting anyone in.

749
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:30,168
I'm not leaving
because I couldn't kill you.

750
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,833
I'm leaving because I could.

751
01:15:27,763 --> 01:15:29,287
Cheers.

752
01:15:29,398 --> 01:15:30,660
Lovely.

753
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:38,290
Hello, Bryce.

754
01:16:38,367 --> 01:16:40,062
Hello, Lara.

755
01:16:40,136 --> 01:16:41,831
Are you ready?

756
01:16:41,904 --> 01:16:42,928
Yeah.

757
01:16:43,005 --> 01:16:46,065
Right. Sending the last images
of the orb...

758
01:16:46,142 --> 01:16:49,111
now.

759
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:54,741
Got them.

760
01:16:57,687 --> 01:17:00,451
Translating.

761
01:17:00,523 --> 01:17:02,013
Done.

762
01:17:05,194 --> 01:17:06,661
Send the sounds.

763
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:10,324
Sending it now.

764
01:17:19,975 --> 01:17:22,739
No, nothing.

765
01:17:22,812 --> 01:17:25,076
Oh, well, back
to the drawing board.

766
01:17:27,249 --> 01:17:28,273
No, wait.

767
01:17:28,417 --> 01:17:29,816
The tones are being distorted.

768
01:17:29,885 --> 01:17:31,113
Send me the file.

769
01:17:31,187 --> 01:17:32,586
Look, Lara, I...

770
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:35,522
I really don't think
that's gonna work, you know?

771
01:17:35,591 --> 01:17:36,649
Yes, course it will.

772
01:17:36,726 --> 01:17:38,921
Ever heard your voice
on a tape recorder?

773
01:17:38,994 --> 01:17:41,554
Same thing.

774
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,291
Why are we having
this discussion?

775
01:17:43,432 --> 01:17:45,559
Send me the file.

776
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:47,124
Sending it.

777
01:17:47,203 --> 01:17:48,966
Thank you.

778
01:18:58,407 --> 01:18:59,806
Lara?

779
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:02,738
Lara?

780
01:19:02,812 --> 01:19:05,406
Africa. It's in Africa.

781
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:08,041
Somewhere near Kilimanjaro.

782
01:19:09,118 --> 01:19:10,449
Great, Lara.

783
01:19:10,519 --> 01:19:13,113
How long will it take Reiss to
put his computers back together?

784
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:14,713
24 hours at the fastest.

785
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:15,916
Get in touch with Kosa.

786
01:19:16,975 --> 01:19:18,855
Ask him to get the car and
meet me north of his village,

787
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:20,986
0800 hours.

788
01:19:21,063 --> 01:19:22,223
Bye, then.

789
01:19:25,568 --> 01:19:27,593
A bit faster than 24 hours, I'd say.

790
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:28,637
Out.

791
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,667
Africa it is.

792
01:19:53,395 --> 01:19:54,293
Kosa.

793
01:19:54,396 --> 01:19:55,294
Lara!

794
01:19:55,397 --> 01:19:56,421
How are you?

795
01:19:56,498 --> 01:19:57,430
Lara?!

796
01:19:57,499 --> 01:19:58,864
You had the jeep cleaned.

797
01:19:58,934 --> 01:19:59,866
Of course.

798
01:19:59,935 --> 01:20:02,267
I know how you like
your equipment.

799
01:20:02,338 --> 01:20:04,704
Where are you? I can't see you.

800
01:20:04,773 --> 01:20:06,434
Don't worry. I can see you.

801
01:20:06,508 --> 01:20:08,806
Okay, where are you
coming from now?

802
01:20:08,878 --> 01:20:10,869
Keep going straight.

803
01:20:10,946 --> 01:20:12,777
Keep your speed steady.

804
01:20:16,452 --> 01:20:19,046
Lara, welcome back!

805
01:20:24,093 --> 01:20:27,585
Do you ever do anything
the easy way?

806
01:20:27,663 --> 01:20:29,358
And risk disappointing you?

807
01:21:05,634 --> 01:21:08,660
Kosa, we've never been here,
have we?

808
01:21:08,737 --> 01:21:12,036
We didn't come
to this area before. Why?

809
01:21:12,107 --> 01:21:14,302
Because I've seen
that mountain before.

810
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:16,037
The box is there somewhere.

811
01:21:16,111 --> 01:21:18,636
The locals call it
"The Mountain of God."

812
01:21:18,714 --> 01:21:21,114
There's a tribe
that makes their home on it

813
01:21:21,183 --> 01:21:22,480
that might help us.

814
01:22:07,896 --> 01:22:09,488
Leave this object and go.

815
01:22:10,566 --> 01:22:12,693
Leave this object and go!

816
01:22:12,768 --> 01:22:14,429
Never speak of it.

817
01:22:14,503 --> 01:22:16,095
To trespass
on the Cradle of Life

818
01:22:16,171 --> 01:22:20,005
is to risk flooding
the entire world with death.

819
01:22:20,576 --> 01:22:22,874
Men are coming for the box,

820
01:22:22,945 --> 01:22:24,207
and unlike me,

821
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:27,214
they won't look at it
with fear, or respect.

822
01:22:27,282 --> 01:22:28,476
They will open it.

823
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:29,881
They want to use it.

824
01:22:29,952 --> 01:22:32,318
And I'm sorry
if I have to disturb your gods

825
01:22:32,421 --> 01:22:34,082
to keep this from happening...

826
01:22:34,156 --> 01:22:37,614
but I will do whatever I must.

827
01:22:50,372 --> 01:22:52,363
Do you truly understand
what you are doing?

828
01:22:54,143 --> 01:22:57,748
Are you truly prepared
for what you're about to learn?

829
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:03,837
Some secrets must remain secrets.

830
01:23:03,872 --> 01:23:08,059
These are very heavy burdens,
very lonely burdens.

831
01:23:11,693 --> 01:23:15,288
And if you find the box,
you will have to carry them.

832
01:23:15,364 --> 01:23:16,797
I am prepared, sir.

833
01:23:21,637 --> 01:23:25,838
He warns that no one who has gone
looking for the box has come back.

834
01:23:25,974 --> 01:23:28,135
He says the land beyond the canyon

835
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,235
belongs to the Shadow Guardians.

836
01:23:30,312 --> 01:23:32,337
Shadow Guardians?

837
01:23:34,283 --> 01:23:36,751
They do not sleep.

838
01:23:36,819 --> 01:23:38,650
They never rest.

839
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:43,214
They move like a wind.

840
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:48,093
And anything that walks
their land, will die.

841
01:23:48,163 --> 01:23:49,562
And the Cradle itself?

842
01:23:52,201 --> 01:23:54,192
Only with the orb
can it be revealed.

843
01:23:54,269 --> 01:23:57,830
Inside you will find
a place of madness

844
01:23:57,906 --> 01:23:59,874
sky and earth are one,

845
01:23:59,942 --> 01:24:01,773
direction meaningless.

846
01:24:06,915 --> 01:24:08,542
He's going to give us 20 men

847
01:24:08,617 --> 01:24:11,279
to take us as far as they can

848
01:24:11,353 --> 01:24:14,880
to the Cradle of Life,
where the box is hidden.

849
01:24:19,862 --> 01:24:21,489
We're getting closer.

850
01:24:26,668 --> 01:24:28,295
He said you are right.

851
01:24:28,437 --> 01:24:30,871
The Cradle of Life lies
near the summit.

852
01:24:32,307 --> 01:24:34,775
He wants to know how you knew.

853
01:24:34,843 --> 01:24:36,071
The orb.

854
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:44,310
He says he will not
turn back with the others.

855
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:45,886
He will go as far as we go.

856
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:49,887
He will fight the Shadow Guardians.

857
01:24:51,393 --> 01:24:53,293
You're a very brave man.

858
01:24:54,596 --> 01:24:56,530
What is...
what is he saying?

859
01:24:56,598 --> 01:24:59,726
That your accent is funny.

860
01:25:33,569 --> 01:25:34,831
Get down!

861
01:25:36,705 --> 01:25:38,002
Get down!

862
01:25:41,577 --> 01:25:42,544
Back! Back!

863
01:25:54,756 --> 01:25:55,723
Back!

864
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:56,587
Get back!

865
01:26:14,876 --> 01:26:17,276
Thank you, Lara,
for leading us here,

866
01:26:17,412 --> 01:26:19,903
and for finding the orb
in the first place.

867
01:26:19,982 --> 01:26:23,465
However, you have seen
the exact position.

868
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,678
You could save me hours,
days even.

869
01:26:25,754 --> 01:26:28,222
Help me.
I'll make it worth your while.

870
01:26:30,559 --> 01:26:31,821
No.

871
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:33,292
But think of what I'm offering you.

872
01:26:33,395 --> 01:26:34,589
Let her go.

873
01:26:37,232 --> 01:26:40,292
The chance to find out
how it all began.

874
01:26:40,435 --> 01:26:44,098
Life, Lara, the origin
of what we are.

875
01:26:44,172 --> 01:26:47,505
Don't tell me you're not tempted.

876
01:26:47,576 --> 01:26:49,771
That's what got Pandora
into trouble.

877
01:26:49,845 --> 01:26:52,678
They told me you wouldn't do it,

878
01:26:52,748 --> 01:26:58,408
and I told them you would rather than
lose two of your closest friends.

879
01:27:00,922 --> 01:27:01,946
Take us to the Cradle of Life.

880
01:27:02,024 --> 01:27:03,355
I'm sorry, Lara.

881
01:27:03,425 --> 01:27:08,624
It's your destiny to see what's inside.

882
01:27:08,697 --> 01:27:11,063
He is right.

883
01:27:11,133 --> 01:27:13,431
It's just beyond the canyon,
remember?

884
01:27:13,502 --> 01:27:15,402
Such a short walk
might save your friends.

885
01:27:20,175 --> 01:27:24,043
Well, if it spares my friends...

886
01:27:24,112 --> 01:27:25,670
I'm up for a walk.

887
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,467
I'm sure she'd understand!
I have a plan.

888
01:28:03,502 --> 01:28:05,250
You should have just
told Lara we were hostage.

889
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,719
Reiss would never
have found out!

890
01:28:21,269 --> 01:28:25,365
I don't suppose either of you
know how to fly a helicopter?

891
01:28:26,842 --> 01:28:27,866
I can.

892
01:28:27,943 --> 01:28:29,410
What?

893
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:30,706
What?

894
01:28:30,779 --> 01:28:33,646
Yeah. I've got over 150 hours

895
01:28:33,715 --> 01:28:36,809
between flight simulation
games, models.

896
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,751
And in the real thing?

897
01:28:39,821 --> 01:28:41,880
Two.

898
01:28:41,957 --> 01:28:43,618
Two.

899
01:28:43,692 --> 01:28:46,593
Well, you're only going to fly
it once I'm out,

900
01:28:46,661 --> 01:28:49,425
so I hope you remember
your two hours well.

901
01:29:22,764 --> 01:29:24,789
It's through here?

902
01:29:24,866 --> 01:29:26,697
Mm.

903
01:29:28,336 --> 01:29:30,361
Move, baby.

904
01:30:58,894 --> 01:31:00,953
What was that?

905
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:02,189
You!

906
01:31:02,264 --> 01:31:03,993
Check it out!

907
01:31:06,701 --> 01:31:09,135
Keep moving.

908
01:31:54,316 --> 01:31:57,717
What are you doing?
Back in formation, now!

909
01:32:49,638 --> 01:32:51,663
Holy shit!

910
01:32:53,808 --> 01:32:56,868
Don't! They seem
to react to movement.

911
01:33:13,728 --> 01:33:16,094
They're gone.

912
01:33:19,367 --> 01:33:20,527
I know we're close.

913
01:33:20,602 --> 01:33:22,263
I've seen it in your eyes.

914
01:33:22,337 --> 01:33:23,929
Take me to Pandora's box.

915
01:33:24,005 --> 01:33:25,836
I don't know how.

916
01:33:25,907 --> 01:33:26,965
Do it now!

917
01:33:29,544 --> 01:33:33,310
Well, you were the one who
wanted to go for a walk,

918
01:33:33,415 --> 01:33:35,315
so start walking.

919
01:33:41,356 --> 01:33:43,381
The next one will be higher.

920
01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:24,460
Only with the orb
can it be revealed.

921
01:34:33,441 --> 01:34:34,840
All right.

922
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:37,469
I'll need the orb.

923
01:34:37,545 --> 01:34:39,809
Do you want to see
the Cradle of Life or not?

924
01:34:39,881 --> 01:34:42,475
You tell me what
to do with it.

925
01:34:46,221 --> 01:34:47,313
Hey!

926
01:35:40,642 --> 01:35:42,303
Don't think you can outwit me,
Croft.

927
01:35:42,377 --> 01:35:45,574
Oh, do shut up.

928
01:35:47,849 --> 01:35:50,409
So, this is the Cradle of Life.

929
01:35:57,325 --> 01:35:58,952
Here we are.

930
01:36:01,062 --> 01:36:02,461
She's all yours.

931
01:36:02,530 --> 01:36:04,464
Time to be a hero.

932
01:37:07,629 --> 01:37:09,358
There it is.

933
01:37:20,775 --> 01:37:23,141
Perfect, isn't it?

934
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:26,772
All that power
in such a banal container.

935
01:37:26,848 --> 01:37:29,976
Legend tells that when
Pandora saw inside the box,

936
01:37:30,051 --> 01:37:32,611
she cried a pool
of black acid for tears.

937
01:37:32,687 --> 01:37:35,247
And as it was a woman
who found the box,

938
01:37:35,323 --> 01:37:38,724
I see no reason
to break with tradition.

939
01:37:40,094 --> 01:37:42,324
A woman should collect the box.

940
01:37:44,132 --> 01:37:45,622
Go on!

941
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,935
It is impossible to reach.

942
01:37:53,141 --> 01:37:55,666
Now, take it!

943
01:37:55,743 --> 01:37:57,574
Take it!

944
01:39:28,469 --> 01:39:30,369
I don't think so, Reiss!

945
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,092
You okay?

946
01:40:28,162 --> 01:40:29,094
Whoa.

947
01:40:29,163 --> 01:40:30,255
I'm fine. I'm fine.

948
01:40:30,331 --> 01:40:31,263
There you go.

949
01:40:31,332 --> 01:40:32,924
Right.

950
01:40:38,673 --> 01:40:40,197
You come prepared.

951
01:40:40,274 --> 01:40:42,902
Well, I know how clumsy you are.

952
01:40:46,881 --> 01:40:49,816
Hillary and Bryce?

953
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:51,715
They're fine.

954
01:41:06,367 --> 01:41:08,301
Thank you.

955
01:41:08,369 --> 01:41:10,803
What was that?

956
01:41:10,872 --> 01:41:13,136
Oh...

957
01:41:13,207 --> 01:41:15,437
thank you.

958
01:41:27,755 --> 01:41:29,916
Let's get out of here.

959
01:41:39,534 --> 01:41:41,092
Terry?

960
01:41:42,503 --> 01:41:43,902
What are you doing?

961
01:41:43,971 --> 01:41:46,838
What? You're joking, right?

962
01:41:48,009 --> 01:41:50,451
We're taking this with us.
This is ours.

963
01:41:52,747 --> 01:41:55,238
You're not walking
out of here with that box.

964
01:41:57,652 --> 01:41:59,210
So, what are you saying?

965
01:41:59,287 --> 01:42:02,154
We just leave it,
when it's worth a fortune?

966
01:42:02,223 --> 01:42:04,088
Put it back.

967
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:05,022
No, I don't think so.

968
01:42:05,092 --> 01:42:09,012
It could kill millions of innocent people.

969
01:42:09,047 --> 01:42:10,688
Now you're being dramatic.

970
01:42:10,765 --> 01:42:12,596
Put it back.

971
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,294
No!

972
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:20,170
I've helped you keep
this away from Reiss.

973
01:42:20,241 --> 01:42:21,833
This is my reward.

974
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:25,675
I'm taking it with me.

975
01:42:34,722 --> 01:42:37,452
So, it's come to this, has it?

976
01:42:37,525 --> 01:42:41,007
Well, you do have authorization to kill me.

977
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:44,627
Better do it, then.

978
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:46,894
'Cause if you think
standing in front of me

979
01:42:46,968 --> 01:42:48,196
is going to be enough...

980
01:42:51,372 --> 01:42:55,468
You don't have it in you
to stop me.

981
01:43:04,151 --> 01:43:05,812
See, all your beliefs...

982
01:43:07,221 --> 01:43:09,712
all your ideals...

983
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:11,417
they're not real.

984
01:43:11,492 --> 01:43:13,653
I am.

985
01:43:13,728 --> 01:43:16,822
And you've loved me.

986
01:43:18,532 --> 01:43:20,830
I don't know how strong
you think you are,

987
01:43:20,901 --> 01:43:25,167
but you are not going
to choose them over me.

988
01:43:28,609 --> 01:43:30,076
Now move.

989
01:43:30,144 --> 01:43:32,009
No.

990
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:36,780
Fine.

991
01:46:04,298 --> 01:46:06,630
The box is safe now.

992
01:46:09,003 --> 01:46:13,099
Some things are not meant
to be found.

993
01:46:22,316 --> 01:46:25,285
Can't you ever do anything
the easy way?

994
01:46:25,352 --> 01:46:28,480
I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

995
01:46:53,147 --> 01:46:54,273
Lara, are you okay?

996
01:46:54,348 --> 01:46:55,747
Lara, you all right?

997
01:46:55,816 --> 01:46:59,183
This is... very touching.

998
01:46:59,253 --> 01:47:01,744
You know us,
always making friends...

999
01:47:01,822 --> 01:47:03,153
having a laugh.

1000
01:47:03,224 --> 01:47:04,657
Getting married.

1001
01:47:06,427 --> 01:47:07,359
What?

1002
01:47:09,096 --> 01:47:12,259
This is a wedding ceremony
and you are the grooms.

1003
01:47:12,366 --> 01:47:14,425
Good luck, boys.

1004
01:47:31,519 --> 01:47:33,146
- Go!
- Go!
