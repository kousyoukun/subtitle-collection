1
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,933
You're going to love this one.
Listen up, here we go.

2
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:30,492
Here you go, Pluto. What did you think?

3
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,185
I don't know what to think, Tony.
I mean....

4
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,026
You got a dress on....

5
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:39,993
This is not a dress, it's a kilt.
Scottish tradition. Very manly, a kilt.

6
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:41,229
It's a manly dress.

7
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,568
No, a kilt.
That's how people know who I am.

8
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,077
People think of Anthony Frankowski,
they immediately think "Scottish crooning."'

9
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:52,478
There lies your problem. That's not even
a thing. Did you make that up?

10
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:55,608
Yes, I made that up.
It's a thing if I made it up.

11
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,720
-It's horrible.
-It's my hook!

12
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:01,379
You know what you need to do
if you're going to croon? Be ltalian.

13
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,752
Be Anthony Frantucci.

14
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,989
-You want me to change my name?
-Yeah, to something that swings.

15
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:09,861
-Anthony Frandicci.
-That doesn't swing.

16
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,025
Anthony...

17
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:13,024
...Francis.

18
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:14,863
-Tony Francis.
-You like that?

19
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:15,996
I'm Tony Francis.

20
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,563
That's a good name.
You're Tony Francis now.

21
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,575
Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Francis.

22
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,874
Absolutely. I like it.
Lose the dress, change the name.

23
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:26,572
-ls your bathroom back there?
-Through the doors.

24
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:29,880
Tony Francis.

25
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:37,759
Am I supposed to piss in the kitchen?

26
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,417
No, it's off to the right.

27
00:04:57,113 --> 00:05:02,073
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
please welcome Mr. Tony Francis!

28
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,922
"'Oh, my God! It's Tony Francis! "'

29
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:10,849
How is showbiz?

30
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,966
Disgusting.

31
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,125
Take a walk, hotshot.

32
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:49,664
Pluto, help me!

33
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,789
Pluto?

34
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:54,729
-Pluto Nash?
-That's right!

35
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,464
-When did you get out of the joint?
-A week ago.

36
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,511
Congratulations.

37
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,768
Thanks a lot.

38
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:05,313
I'm Gino.

39
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:09,212
This is my nephew, Larry.
Larry, say hello to Pluto Nash.

40
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:10,716
What's going on?

41
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,883
My brother was inside with you.
Angelo Sotobolo.

42
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:17,058
Angelo Cheesecake is your brother?

43
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:21,526
We used to play cards in his cell every
weekend. He'd have the shit catered.

44
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,157
-He thinks the world of you.
-It's mutual.

45
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,168
Pluto is my best friend.

46
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:31,573
What are you guys doing?
What's going on, Gino?

47
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,902
We're cleaning out his digestive system.

48
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,973
Gino, I can't let you do that, man.

49
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:43,374
Pluto.

50
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,456
Your pal borrowed $2.5 million
from me four years ago...

51
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:51,516
-...to buy this joint.
-On an easy payment plan.

52
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,565
Here. I think that will get it off.

53
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,364
-How much does he owe you now?
-$2.5 million.

54
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:03,596
-He didn't pay anything back?
-No.

55
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,604
Any idiot can make money here.

56
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,667
This guy has to do
his cockamamie act each night.

57
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,670
It's like a damn freak show.

58
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:13,408
I seen it. You see where this shit got you?

59
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:14,814
Gino, listen.

60
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:18,720
I'm not in the smuggling business anymore.
I'm opening my own club.

61
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:19,720
No kidding.

62
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,691
It's always been a lifelong dream of mine
to have my own club.

63
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:24,782
Life--

64
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,829
Dinner and dancing and nice atmosphere.

65
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,497
Good place, hot music.

66
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:35,126
Once I get it going, I'll sit back,
light up a cigar and enjoy the party.

67
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:36,532
What could be better?

68
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,433
Nothing could be better.
We could be partners.

69
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:41,633
You know what?

70
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:46,947
What if I pay off his debt,
take over this place, and we call it square?

71
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,027
Let's have a drink and talk about it.

72
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,323
Out of these glasses?

73
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:04,160
-Are you crazy? Across the street.
-All right.

74
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,496
What will you do about my friend?

75
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,130
Anthony?

76
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:13,036
My gift to you.

77
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:14,969
You're a prince.

78
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:18,844
I'll go across the street and have
some beers and work out the logistics.

79
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:22,507
Just sit here in your skirt
and I'll see you in a minute.

80
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,118
9: 18 Lunar Grand Express...

81
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:34,491
...now ready for general boarding
on platform 22.

82
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,649
Welcome to the Moon.

83
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:59,686
While you're here, be sure and visit
the Lunar Grand Resort and Casino...

84
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:02,380
...only two hours away by hover shuttle.

85
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,619
Remember, Moon Beach is the only place
in the universe where gambling is legal.

86
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:12,699
The Lunar Grand.
The perfect family vacation.

87
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:42,958
Incoming!

88
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,388
Thanks, Pluto!

89
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:50,636
Pace yourselves. It's only 10:.00.
This ain't a bachelor party.

90
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:54,540
Yeah, it is.
Tommy here is getting divorced tomorrow.

91
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,908
-Really? Congratulations.
-Thank you.

92
00:09:56,979 --> 00:10:00,608
I tell you what. Drinks are on the house
for the rest of the night.

93
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,540
You're the best, Pluto!

94
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:05,481
Excuse me a second.

95
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:06,782
Thanks a lot, Pluto.

96
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,322
He's the best!

97
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:13,257
Crank it up. I'm not running a library
in here! Crank it up!

98
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:24,962
All right!

99
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,777
Keep it like that! Keep it pumping!

100
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,412
Hey, Miguel!

101
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,650
-Not bad for a Tuesday night.
-Not bad at all.

102
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,717
It's like the whole city turned out.

103
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:49,192
We've come a long way, baby.

104
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,128
Long way. All right, partner.

105
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,100
-Look at that ass. I'll be right back.
-Oh, my goodness.

106
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:57,939
Sorry, I'll get that.

107
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,203
Sorry.

108
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:05,503
It's all right, it's okay.

109
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:12,181
Could you help me?
I'm looking for the owner, Pluto Nash.

110
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,222
Why are you looking for that lowlife?

111
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,382
It's personal.

112
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,486
He doesn't even know you.

113
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,357
-Yes, he does.
-No, I don't.

114
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,155
You're him?

115
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,131
Last time I checked. How can I help you?

116
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,932
I just came all the way from Salt Lake City.

117
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:27,991
Rough town.

118
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:32,365
I'm a good singer. I got this gig,
they gave me a one-way ticket up here.

119
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,773
But the guys who own the nightclub sold it.

120
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:39,837
I'm dead broke. I need a job.
I want to go home. Can you help me out?

121
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,348
Sorry, I can't help you.

122
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:45,217
I'm sure there's a bunch of clubs
that can use a good singer, but we got a DJ.

123
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,379
Take it easy.

124
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:50,785
I'm sure they could,
but my Moon card expired...

125
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,591
...and I was told you were the one person
in town who might overlook that.

126
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,858
Who told you something foolish like that?

127
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,296
You know my father, Nicholas Lake?

128
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,726
Never heard of him.

129
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:03,566
Nicky Sticks?

130
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:05,366
That's your father?

131
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:07,838
Unbelievable. That's something.

132
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:13,981
Normally I don't call in favors,
but my dad did save your life back in '76.

133
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:17,116
He didn't save my life, I saved his life.

134
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:19,447
And I lost a fine automobile in the process.

135
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:23,390
Unless you got a new Plymouth
with my name on it, I got nothing to say.

136
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,986
So, good night.

137
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:26,756
Thanks, Dad.

138
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,227
I should have known. I'm sorry.

139
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,138
Maybe I got something.

140
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:42,938
Really? Great! Shall we say
two shows a night, five nights a week?

141
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,503
Shall we say six nights a week
waiting tables?

142
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,947
You can save up your tips, make
enough money to get back home. Deal?

143
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:51,849
Deal.

144
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:17,271
-ls it like this every night?
-Only the slow ones.

145
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,246
Somebody is coming in.

146
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,747
Sorry, fellows, we're closed.

147
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,908
We're here to see Mr. Nash.

148
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:25,518
Is he expecting you?

149
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:34,028
$10 million is more than a fair offer,
Mr. Nash.

150
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:37,663
I don't know. I own
the most successful club in Little America.

151
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:42,167
I own it outright.
I'm my own boss, and I have the hottest--

152
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:49,035
I got the best party in town.
Why would I want to sell this place?

153
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,005
$10 million?

154
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,043
Get your shit off my desk!

155
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:57,611
No, boys.

156
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:01,449
Please meet my friend
and bodyguard, Bruno.

157
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:06,560
Gentlemen.

158
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,062
Bruno, the boys.

159
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:11,694
Looks like you're about due for a trade-in.

160
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,498
Hey, Bruno.

161
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:16,293
What are you, a '65?

162
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:19,372
Model '63 Deluxe.

163
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,466
'63? Talk about ancient.

164
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,610
Your sister didn't seem to mind.

165
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,044
Screw you, robot!

166
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:29,445
He can be fixed, you can't.

167
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,211
We don't mean to cause any problems.

168
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,084
He's reaching, you know?

169
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:36,724
Okay. No reaching.

170
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:39,387
Mr. Nash...

171
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,221
...this is non-negotiable.

172
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:48,203
Rex Crater is buying your club.

173
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:52,101
I was wondering when you all
was going to get to me.

174
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,839
$10 million.

175
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:02,143
Tell Mr. Crater, thanks, but no, thanks.
I won't sell my club.

176
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:05,653
If I have my way,
no one here will sell their place...

177
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:09,555
...because we like this town the way it is.
So, if you'd be so kind, get out.

178
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:19,128
Rex Crater does not like to be disappointed.

179
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:22,498
I'll just have to send Mr. Crater
a case of Scotch!

180
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:29,639
-Great first night, Dina.
-Thanks.

181
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:34,041
Do me a favor. Run this up to Pluto.
I need to lock up the back.

182
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,210
Thank you very much.

183
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,316
Miguel?

184
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:46,725
This isn't some send-up-the-new-girl
kind of a thing, right?

185
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:50,387
No. Relax. He wouldn't do that.
You're safe, go ahead.

186
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:56,965
Come on in.

187
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,143
Perfect timing.

188
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,747
Miguel asked me to bring it up.

189
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,413
Perfect.

190
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,342
Should I make it for you?

191
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,718
No, I mix my own martinis.
But thank you, anyway.

192
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,121
I got it down to a pretty good science.

193
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,266
Perfect.

194
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,967
I wanted to thank you again for the job.

195
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:37,768
-Don't even mention it.
-Well, I am mentioning it. Thank you.

196
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:41,315
You're very welcome.

197
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,108
Let me get this, okay?

198
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:48,050
-Hello?
-Hello, Nash.

199
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:51,388
Don't call me this time of night.
What's wrong with you?

200
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,193
You know Tony Francis?

201
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:59,562
I knew him back when he was Anthony
Frankowski. We were like brothers.

202
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:03,833
We grew up together. Me and Anthony
Frankowski, who would later become--

203
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,268
I'll tell you a real funny story in a second.

204
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,074
Hello?

205
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:12,170
Just wanted to give you one last chance
to change your mind.

206
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:16,149
Look, no now and no tomorrow.
No means no. Leave me alone.

207
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:18,008
Now, you look--

208
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:19,918
Clown.

209
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:21,982
Who was that?

210
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:24,582
One of Rex Crater's boys,
trying to buy me out.

211
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,018
Why is he so set on buying your club?

212
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:30,065
Because they're about to approve gambling
in this town.

213
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,192
If Crater gets his way,
they'll turn the Moon into a big casino.

214
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:36,465
You can't sell your club till I make
enough money to get back home.

215
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:40,497
I'll let him know the next time he calls
that you got to get your money first.

216
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,319
-You all right? You okay?
-Yeah.

217
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,482
-What happened?
-I don't know!

218
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,859
Come on.

219
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:09,033
Bruno!

220
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,764
Bomb detonated. Evacuate.

221
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:14,908
Evacuate.

222
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:17,038
Bomb detonated.

223
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,301
Evacuate.

224
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,575
Bruno, look what they did to my place!

225
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:26,981
Pluto!

226
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:31,789
Damn!

227
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,988
Let's get them.

228
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,553
No. Stay here with her!

229
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:45,604
-Bruno, I think that's one of them.
-I'll intercept the call.

230
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:50,138
"'Nash is alive. He took off after Jimmy,
who's headed for the Vac.

231
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:51,874
"'Be ready for him."'

232
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:53,205
What's the Vac?

233
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:56,843
The Perfect Vacuum, at the corner
of Glenn Avenue and Fifth. Why?

234
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:58,682
Didn't you hear the phone call?

235
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:01,587
I'm sorry, I cannot listen and hear
at the same time.

236
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:04,217
You see, I'm a '63.
Only later models can do that!

237
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,057
-Pluto's in trouble. Come on.
-Trouble?

238
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:12,725
-ls that as fast as you go?
-I'm a '63! I'm at top speed!

239
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,815
Get out of the way!

240
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:36,390
Reset. Reset. Reset.

241
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:14,120
You try to shake me down,
then you blow up my club?

242
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:15,788
You blew up my wood barstools!

243
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,230
You know how hard it is
to get wood on the Moon?

244
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:23,131
Shit!

245
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:27,505
You want to play games?
You have to shoot around your boy!

246
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,373
It's easier to shoot through him.

247
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:31,342
Shit!

248
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,697
-Pluto, it's a trap!
-Yeah, no kidding!

249
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,337
Did you ever shoot a gun before?

250
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,285
Time to go, Bruno!

251
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:54,992
All clear, boss!

252
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,226
Come on!

253
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,962
Bruno, heel!

254
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,236
-You are really something, you know that?
-Thank you.

255
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,876
You walked right into a trap
any idiot could see from a mile away.

256
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:14,177
I was walking right out
until you came along.

257
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,477
-Really?
-Yes, really.

258
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,041
You put your neck on the line,
I appreciate that.

259
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,216
But in the future, not that there'll be
a future, if I need your help, I'll ask.

260
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,656
Don't worry about it,
I'm getting out of here.

261
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:29,354
I saved your life twice. Least you can do
is loan me enough money so I can go home.

262
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:33,433
I would, but they'll be looking for you
at every bus station and shuttle launch.

263
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,800
Me? They don't even know
what I look like.

264
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:39,034
Every club in this city
has a biometric camera system.

265
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,167
They took hundreds of pictures of you.
They know what you look like.

266
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,869
Only way you're going home now
is in a box.

267
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,342
That's just great. Now what?

268
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,543
After you.

269
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,149
Hey, Roy.

270
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:01,454
Pluto! What are you doing here?

271
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,067
My place is getting redecorated
and I need a place overnight.

272
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:10,136
Sure! 3D. The code is 4-5-7.

273
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:11,365
Thanks, Roy.

274
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:30,757
So, this is the Garden of Paradise.

275
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:32,959
My, my.

276
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:35,326
If this is too glitzy for you...

277
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,455
...tomorrow we can get a room
at the Garden of Eden.

278
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,626
They got a bathroom on every floor.

279
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:43,332
I hate the Moon.

280
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,703
Know why Mooners can't stand Earthlings?

281
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:49,403
You think everything back Earth is better
and can't stop talking about it.

282
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:52,379
I went back Earth once
and the air smelled funny.

283
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:56,674
Sneezing all the time, rained every day,
bugs and shit everywhere.

284
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:59,219
You know the only thing I liked about it?

285
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,517
-You could see the Moon at night?
-Bingo.

286
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,688
-ls something wrong with your toaster?
-He's all right. He's just recharging.

287
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:12,794
Can he hear us?

288
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,634
Not while he's charging.

289
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,696
Shouldn't your bodyguard be able to keep
up with you on the way to a gunfight?

290
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,304
You might want to think
about trading him in.

291
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:24,469
I can't trade in Bruno.
We got a history together.

292
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:27,582
I got 20 years of rill-hopping experience
wired into him.

293
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,479
-Rill-hopping?
-Well, that's a....

294
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,888
Smuggling. That's what I went to jail for.

295
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:38,888
He ain't the fastest thing in the world,
but he got me out of lots of tight squeezes.

296
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,552
A little smokier than usual.

297
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,824
-He's a fire hazard.
-He's all right.

298
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,193
Where are you going?

299
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:47,099
I got to go talk to an old friend,
see what I can find out.

300
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:48,636
What am I supposed to do?

301
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:51,399
Make sure
Bruno don't burn the place down.

302
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:54,203
-You're leaving me alone with him?
-I left.

303
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:55,265
Pluto!

304
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,089
You're getting kind of old, Rowland.

305
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,720
You should be so lucky. Every lowlife
in town is looking to whack you.

306
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,028
I'm a popular guy. What can I say?

307
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:20,725
You want to lose some money?

308
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:24,101
No, but you'll lose money.
We'll play some eight ball, regular stakes.

309
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:27,168
-I will kindly empty your wallet for you.
-You're on.

310
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,304
How is your mother?

311
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,448
Still breaking hearts.

312
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:37,481
Pizza time.

313
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,545
She should have married me.

314
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,748
You should have went to the gym
and lost weight.

315
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:45,691
I'd have lost the weight if she married me.
Otherwise, what's the point?

316
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,491
I really need your help.
I got to get to Rex Crater.

317
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:51,427
Forget it. Nobody gets to him.

318
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,991
-Who the hell is this guy?
-A myth, an enigma.

319
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:59,504
He lives in a penthouse
above the Lunar Grand Hotel.

320
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:01,273
Never comes out.

321
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,072
You was a cop for 20 years.

322
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,339
You got to have some kind of idea
who he is.

323
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:07,278
Some people think he's a clone.

324
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:11,409
There was a clone doctor
named Runa Pedanken.

325
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:15,721
Made a big name for herself creating
a basketball team from one old guy.

326
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:17,389
The Air Jordans.

327
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:22,920
Right after cloning was outlawed
back Earth, Pedanken came up here.

328
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,133
She was the best in her field
until she got herself murdered.

329
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,029
That was about eight years ago.

330
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:34,205
I'm going to need to hack into police files.

331
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:37,104
You mean, you need me
to hack into police files.

332
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:39,174
I thought you'd never ask.

333
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:46,751
Pedanken, Runa. Initiate global search.

334
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,291
File deleted.

335
00:26:51,893 --> 00:26:53,656
Sorry, that's all there is.

336
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,825
She wasn't doing this by herself.
Who worked with her?

337
00:26:56,898 --> 00:26:59,162
She had an assistant.

338
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:02,732
We questioned her for days
about the murder. Got nothing.

339
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,329
That's because you have no finesse.
Who is she and where do I find her?

340
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:07,534
Mona Zimmer.

341
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,978
Runs a body alteration shop
on Microsoft and Sixth.

342
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,414
That's what I love about you.

343
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:18,543
I ask you a simple question,
four hours later, I get a simple answer.

344
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,404
Boss?

345
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:42,909
Where did the boss go?

346
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:46,807
I don't know. Out.
He said to wait for him here.

347
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,143
Out?

348
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,509
He never goes anywhere without me.

349
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:54,413
And I heard that toaster crack.

350
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,653
Bruno, give me that old badge you got.

351
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,862
-Who are we going to arrest?
-I need your help.

352
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,754
Sure.

353
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,062
Where are we going?

354
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:10,298
It's just got to be the two of us.
You go next time. Promise.

355
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:14,832
That's gratitude for you.

356
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,326
We were hoping that for our anniversary
we could get a brand-new us.

357
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,484
How romantic.

358
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:36,861
You're in luck!

359
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:39,957
I just happen to have a cancellation.

360
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:41,160
Fantastic!

361
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:45,172
Are you all original
or have you been previously improved?

362
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:47,600
All original.

363
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:48,774
Really?

364
00:28:48,843 --> 00:28:50,936
Yes, from top to bottom.

365
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:54,379
Okay, then.
Well, what exactly did you have in mind?

366
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:58,913
We were thinking we could start
with some ass-resculpting for her...

367
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,387
...to get a little more bubblage--

368
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:03,857
I happen to have a great ass!

369
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:07,258
I'm not saying your ass isn't great.
We'd like something--

370
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,290
Could you do something
about his big mouth?

371
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:13,232
Do you have any catalogues?
Maybe we could get some ideas.

372
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:16,737
Come this way,
I'll show you exactly what you want.

373
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,994
Thank you.

374
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,835
Come on, honey.
Look at the asses on the wall.

375
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,433
Yeah. Don't push it.

376
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,588
Let's start with some
of the basic body types.

377
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:38,956
Here's one I think you'll really like.
The Amazon.

378
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:44,087
I don't like that. That makes me
look like a big dufus, doesn't it?

379
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:47,598
-Where would we buy clothes?
-I don't want to be the big dufus.

380
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,634
Good point. Let me try again.

381
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:53,772
This one I'm particularly proud of.

382
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,236
The Venice Beach.

383
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,484
Wait a minute.
I think you done found something there.

384
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,779
Look at that, honey.

385
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:07,147
Yeah, look at that. Look at me!

386
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,387
This is me?

387
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:10,680
It could be.

388
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:13,556
Honey, I'm looking and I'm thinking...

389
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:17,758
...that you need to rethink the ass
enhancement. It will work, it will help out.

390
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,563
What you want is to have a.... You know?

391
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,505
She also needs a little more of this, too,
up top. Can you fix this?

392
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,536
If you could spruce these up a little.
Just a little sprucier.

393
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:31,476
I know that she has ample now.

394
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:35,505
But I'm talking titties galore.
Let's have the titties really flowing.

395
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,981
Yeah, like that.

396
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,814
Look at that.

397
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:47,851
Why don't we step into my office
and discuss the terms?

398
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,762
Yes, let's go in and sign up! Look at that!

399
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,733
Before we get started, there's a few things
I'd like to talk over with you.

400
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:00,069
First of all, will you be paying in cash...

401
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,440
...or would you like to take advantage
of our flexible financing plan?

402
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:04,808
All in cash, all at once.

403
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:08,576
-Excellent! Medical records?
-Right here.

404
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,174
And police permit?

405
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,318
Our police permits?

406
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:19,486
I think you'll find
that our police permits are in order.

407
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,389
Police permits.

408
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:26,061
Sorry, no can do. Not without
a police permit. It's Body Alteration 101.

409
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,432
You could be fugitives, killers, anybody.

410
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:32,633
No, we're just a couple trying
to put the spark back in our relationship.

411
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,573
The idea of revealing such personal details
to the police.

412
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,543
Please, Dr. Zimmer?

413
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:41,170
All right. Come back tonight, 8:.00 sharp.

414
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:43,774
But it's another $10,000 upon completion.

415
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:46,012
All right. Then, doctor, you are busted.

416
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:49,913
Give me a break.
What are you guys, the Health Department?

417
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,154
You wish we were.
Listen, you got one chance.

418
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:56,786
You answer some questions for me.
And I want the truth.

419
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,659
Okay, what do you want to know?

420
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,035
-When you worked for Runa Pedanken--
-I never heard of her.

421
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:04,936
You want to play games?
Put the cuffs on her.

422
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:06,400
Come on, cuff her.

423
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:09,675
No! Just hold on!

424
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:11,238
Hold the cuffs.

425
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:15,180
Tell me everything you know
and don't play games with me, Mona.

426
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,547
Talk to me. What do you know?
Right now.

427
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,687
All right, all right.

428
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:24,447
Towards the end, Runa was dealing
with some pretty heavy characters...

429
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,655
...but she didn't tell me who.
And she didn't keep any records.

430
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,224
But one day I walked into her office
as she was showing one of the guys out...

431
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:35,462
...and he left his briefcase behind.

432
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,868
The initials WZW were embossed on it...

433
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,605
...in gold.

434
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:44,973
And it was made out
of genuine alligator skin. Are you with me?

435
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,411
Earth goods.

436
00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:48,673
That's all I know. I swear it.

437
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:54,917
Just for the record, I have never had
one complaint about my ass.

438
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:59,651
I was just playing. I said that for the lady.
It was part of the scam.

439
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,858
Ma, what are you doing here?

440
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:07,798
Seeing that you're all right.

441
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:10,104
Ma, this is Dina. Dina, my mother.

442
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:11,465
You're his mother?

443
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:13,607
Why, you got a problem with that?

444
00:33:13,775 --> 00:33:16,300
I'm surprised.
You could easily pass for his sister.

445
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,378
Thank you.

446
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:20,073
Why are you gallivanting around?
You'll wind up dead.

447
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:22,776
I got to take care of those guys
that blew up my club.

448
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,648
-You got to get your ass off the Moon!
-I don't think so.

449
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,984
You think you're a hot-shit, ex-rill-hopping,
burned-down-club-owning guy...

450
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,117
...but once in a while, listen to your mother.

451
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:36,095
All right, I'll get off the Moon!
But can I get something to eat first?

452
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:37,694
God!

453
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,630
Bruno, get some beer and sandwiches.

454
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:44,271
And you ought to be a little nicer
to your robot.

455
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,439
Be nicer to my robot?

456
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:53,970
You been in here bitching to my moms?

457
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,813
Gentlemen.

458
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,989
Suite with a hot tub?

459
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:09,155
Which room is Nash in?
Lie to me and I will blow your head off.

460
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,619
3D.

461
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,163
You take the stairs.
You two, take the elevator.

462
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:17,966
Let the robots take the stairs.

463
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,438
You stay here.

464
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,735
Pluto, this is Roy. You got company.

465
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,737
We got to move out of here.

466
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:36,321
Come on, this way!

467
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:42,226
Bruno, check and see
if we can get out the window!

468
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,261
Model DRL '84.

469
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:51,700
Very nice.

470
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,229
Bruno!

471
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,742
Excuse me.

472
00:34:57,378 --> 00:34:59,073
Too high to jump!

473
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:05,815
Bruno, see what you can do
with these bolts.

474
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,717
Okay. Ready?

475
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,083
Go!

476
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,234
Freeze!

477
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:28,870
Raise your hands!

478
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:34,043
Excuse me. Can I get through here?

479
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:36,110
Go back to your room, lady.

480
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,225
-Nice shooting, Ma!
-Thanks, baby.

481
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:47,959
I'll call you back.

482
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:49,426
Stay here!

483
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:21,522
Bruno, enough!

484
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:24,154
Rowland, it's Pluto.

485
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:26,493
I got to get to the Far Side.

486
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,692
I need you to get me a spacesuit.

487
00:36:29,337 --> 00:36:32,602
Make that two spacesuits.
One for a female about 5'7"'.

488
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,536
I'll tell you when I get there.

489
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:53,350
-This is Dina.
-Nice to meet you.

490
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:54,583
Hi. Thanks.

491
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:56,323
I'm getting ready to leave town.

492
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,592
How will you get to the Far Side?
Walk there?

493
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,635
I got that covered.
I'm arranging for some transportation.

494
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:04,234
That's it.

495
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:11,042
-Code generator serial number?
-8-7-4-3-5-0-8.

496
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:12,573
Check.

497
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:27,457
It's not my business, but why don't we
just rent a car instead of stealing one?

498
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:29,188
Because you can't rent these.

499
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:33,632
-What's so special about it?
-It's a Chrysler DeSoto S-5000.

500
00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:37,865
It cruises on a 14-inch cushion of air,
hikes up to 64 inches in rough terrain.

501
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:41,272
It's heat and meteor resistant,
with a torque compressor power thrust...

502
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,105
...and a kick-ass sound system.

503
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:46,472
Trust me on this one.
Bruno, I need an ignition chip.

504
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,441
This might do the trick.

505
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,318
It will work perfect.

506
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:58,085
Got to love a place where your bodyguard
and car have interchangeable parts.

507
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,430
Smart-ass. After you.

508
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:20,777
Good evening, Mr. Vandervoort.
James here. Aren't you early, sir?

509
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:26,547
We're surprising Mrs. Vandervoort
with some jam and scones...

510
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,316
...and picking her up
at a spa on the Far Side.

511
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,515
You're not Mr. Vandervoort at all.

512
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:34,220
You're some hooligan
trying to steal his motorcar.

513
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:35,626
I won't have it!

514
00:38:35,696 --> 00:38:38,028
Shut up and drive. Head for the Far Side.

515
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,865
I'll give you to the count of three
before I alert the authorities. One.

516
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:45,463
Sorry, James. You're too late.
I have disconnected your alarm relay.

517
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:53,209
So get moving, Jimmy boy,
or you'll have a speech impediment.

518
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,178
Good God, I'm being stolen!

519
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:25,936
Take over for a while, James.

520
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,843
I will not be an accomplice in this.

521
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:31,578
You're not an accomplice,
you're a hostage. Do it.

522
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:33,916
-I won't be intimidated.
-Do it!

523
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:34,977
All right.

524
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:36,686
Thank you.

525
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:39,357
Nice work, James.

526
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:42,121
Yeah, James. You little asshole.

527
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:43,454
I heard that.

528
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:46,833
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

529
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:50,199
Hey, listen,
I won't let anything happen to you.

530
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,166
I promise.

531
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,670
All right.

532
00:39:58,212 --> 00:40:00,407
How long does the night last up here?

533
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:01,837
Two weeks.

534
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:06,209
-That's so depressing.
-No, it's not. It's nice. Look at this.

535
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,288
When I was a little boy,
I used to come out here with Rowland...

536
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:19,560
...Iook up and count the stars,
and dream about what was out there.

537
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:22,500
I never heard such drivel in my life!

538
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:25,769
What kind of refreshments
you got back here?

539
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:28,933
Dreadfully sorry, sir.
We weren't expecting anyone.

540
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:32,340
I know you got something.
You going to make me house it?

541
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,047
Champagne and caviar!

542
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,449
Don't touch those, they're for guests!

543
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,580
James, we are guests.

544
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:50,055
He'll get her drunk
and have his way with her.

545
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:51,822
You know something?

546
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:59,198
Bad luck, old boy!

547
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,234
We were ambushed?

548
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,264
-Ambushed?
-Yes, sir.

549
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:34,839
Really? Well, they're just not playing fair.

550
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:40,036
Any other excuses? Problems at home,
cold coming on, work too stressful? What?

551
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:41,808
-Nothing, sir.
-Good.

552
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:45,474
Because the next time I talk to Rex Crater,
I need to say Nash is dead.

553
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:48,147
-That's all he wants to hear.
-It's as good as done.

554
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,688
Or else you are.

555
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:52,419
Get out of here.

556
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:55,924
We'll get right on it, sir.

557
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,773
Where are we?

558
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,473
Safe. It's an old prospecting dome.

559
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:19,550
We found it years back.
Nobody knows about it but me and Bruno.

560
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,991
What's the temperature out here?

561
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:33,299
It's about 200 below.

562
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,832
Balmy.

563
00:43:02,062 --> 00:43:04,496
Play's over. Get down here.

564
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:05,992
Okay.

565
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,339
That was fun.

566
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:37,796
Memories.
Had a lot of memories in here, Bruno.

567
00:43:38,732 --> 00:43:40,290
Look at all this junk.

568
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,697
What do you mean "'junk"'?
This is called inventory.

569
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,474
Show a little respect.
This is what's left of my life's work.

570
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:11,321
Very interesting help you have around here.

571
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,866
That's an old program I forgot to delete.

572
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:17,228
Left it on "'Oops! "'
I forgot that was in there.

573
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:29,646
Miss me?

574
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,574
Guess not.

575
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:37,420
She's an excellent piece
of multi-functional software.

576
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,591
Initiate search.

577
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,960
Convicted organized crime,
Earthling, initials WZW.

578
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,756
WZW.

579
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,869
No WZW.

580
00:44:51,538 --> 00:44:56,271
Nothing. Thank you.
Thanks for nothing. Worthless computer.

581
00:44:56,477 --> 00:44:57,603
How's it going?

582
00:44:57,678 --> 00:44:59,475
It's not going at all.

583
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,613
Babette made lunch.

584
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:03,975
Thank you. Thank you so much.

585
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:07,284
Can I help?

586
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:10,388
Computer's got no information
on our mystery man.

587
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:13,788
I'm starting to think
that that Zimmer conned us.

588
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:18,230
Here's your problem.
Zimmer said WZW, not MZM.

589
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,695
You're just looking at it upside--

590
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:22,559
Wait a minute.

591
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:28,500
You did it! Look at you! You're a genius!

592
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:31,868
Look what you did.
She saw it upside down.

593
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,912
Watch this.

594
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:39,984
Initiate search. Convicted organized crime,
Earthling, initials MZM.

595
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,351
Okay. You see? Now we have something.

596
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,622
Open file 10-17 MM.

597
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:54,700
How do you feel about your acquittal,
Mr. Marucci?

598
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:58,329
Makes me proud to live in this great
country where justice is still served.

599
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:01,670
With gambling to be outlawed on Earth,
will the Giovanetto syndicate...

600
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:05,234
...engender a consortium to perpetuate
a new gambling coalition on the Moon?

601
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:08,110
Will the what do what to the what?
Speak English, sweetheart.

602
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,242
Will you and the other major
organized crime figures on Earth--

603
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:15,352
Organized crime?
I don't know nobody in organized crime.

604
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,421
Listen, darling...

605
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:21,461
...you want to ask me a question,
let's sit down somewhere.

606
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:24,361
We'll open a bottle of wine,
get to know each other better.

607
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,626
Get a new dress, a nice pair of shoes.

608
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,964
Be at my hotel around 7::00.

609
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:32,731
What are you waiting for, a dance?

610
00:46:37,778 --> 00:46:39,803
I forgot the stairs were there.

611
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:44,614
Back it up.

612
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:49,381
Let me take it in a little closer here.

613
00:46:50,123 --> 00:46:52,023
And closer still.

614
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:54,183
What do you see?

615
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,758
So Mike Marucci is Rex Crater?

616
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:00,894
One way to find out.

617
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,960
That's pretty far-fetched, Pluto.

618
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:06,166
But I buy it.

619
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,535
Marucci had the bucks, he had the balls.

620
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,135
He had the background
to build Moon Beach.

621
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:15,813
Not to mention he wouldn't mind
whacking anybody who got in his way.

622
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:17,214
So I noticed.

623
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:21,082
Pluto, when you make an enemy,
you don't mess around.

624
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,321
Yeah, you know me.

625
00:47:23,657 --> 00:47:26,683
I'm gonna see an old buddy at the FBl,
I'll get back to you.

626
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:27,782
Right.

627
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:34,597
Listen to that! That's Connecticut.
Listen how clear.

628
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,924
What's this?

629
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:41,500
No, don't do that! Stop!
That's a cryogenic Chihuahua!

630
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,868
It's a real dog?

631
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,072
Yeah, it's very delicate.
You know it's illegal to bring pets here.

632
00:47:47,147 --> 00:47:50,776
But I got a friend back in Juarez
who knows how to freeze-dry these things.

633
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,375
Look at that. It's a girl.

634
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,381
Pop that little bitch in the particle wave
for two minutes on defrost...

635
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,614
...she'll be running around the room.

636
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,420
I used to get $5,000 a pop for these things.

637
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,296
Where'd you do your singing back Earth?

638
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,433
Weddings, bar mitzvahs,
reincarnation rituals.

639
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:10,299
The usual gigs. I hit a rut...

640
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:15,103
...so I sent my tape to a club I heard about
up here. Figured, what the hell?

641
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,372
They sent me a one-way ticket.

642
00:48:18,445 --> 00:48:20,777
But when I got here,
the place had been sold.

643
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:26,246
I checked the water tanks.
We have enough to stay here for months.

644
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,648
What about food?

645
00:48:27,721 --> 00:48:28,710
Plenty.

646
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:31,883
Let's have a dinner party.
Let's change the mood in this place.

647
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:33,657
All right.

648
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:38,463
He seems a little.... Does he get angry?

649
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:42,525
No. He has a happiness chip
I had installed. That's why he's always....

650
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:47,599
-Does he mind when you make fun of him?
-No, the happiness chip.

651
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,905
I wish I had a happiness chip
in my ass so I'd always be happy.

652
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:55,344
Has one-sixth gravity been giving you
chronic back pain?

653
00:48:55,415 --> 00:49:00,512
We at the Lunar Lumbar Clinic specialize
in replacing the lumbar vertebrae...

654
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:04,216
...with our patented
epoxy spinal substitute.

655
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,026
You see,
once Dr. Pedanken was murdered...

656
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:12,062
...there's no link
to prove a Marucci clone ever existed!

657
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:16,091
-Please, after we eat, okay?
-Now I got to buy you dinner, too?

658
00:49:19,773 --> 00:49:21,240
I'll tell you, Jack...

659
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:24,869
...detective work was a lot easier
before they invented cloning.

660
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:27,638
At least you knew who your friends were.

661
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:43,261
Who is that?
Nobody even has this number.

662
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:46,657
-Ma!
-Pluto!

663
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,497
Get off this line.
What if somebody is tracing this call?

664
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:53,369
Pluto, Rowland is dead!
They found him murdered.

665
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,511
How could they do this?
I can't believe this.

666
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:03,579
Pluto, please get off the Moon!
They're going to kill you, too.

667
00:50:03,984 --> 00:50:05,178
Did you hear me?

668
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,050
I got some business
to take care of. I'll be back in touch.

669
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,619
Pluto.

670
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,185
Bruno!

671
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:13,857
-Come on!
-Yes, boss!

672
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:15,958
They killed Rowland!

673
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:21,260
You know why? We came too close
to the truth. It's time to confront Marucci!

674
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,995
-We better wear protection.
-You'll be safe here.

675
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:25,561
You're leaving me behind?

676
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,298
-What is that?
-Recreational vehicle approaching.

677
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,517
Let's get it right this time, okay?

678
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,532
Registered to Lunar Grand Hotel.

679
00:50:55,602 --> 00:50:58,867
-What the hell is that?
-I'd put on my spacesuit if I were you.

680
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,878
I count five of them.

681
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:15,115
Four with 43-K Magnums
and one Scorpion rocket launcher.

682
00:51:15,188 --> 00:51:18,180
-lnitiate countermeasures!
-There are no countermeasures.

683
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:22,193
-Break out all the assault weapons!
-We sold them, remember?

684
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,431
Where's that big-ass street sweeper
with the supercharger?

685
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,023
It's at your mom's.

686
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,691
Great! What are we going to do?

687
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:31,495
Bathroom!

688
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,400
-Bathroom?
-Yeah, come on!

689
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:35,871
Babette, secure yourself!

690
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,275
Bruno, hold us down!

691
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:31,520
Johnson, stay with me.

692
00:52:31,698 --> 00:52:34,599
You three, go in and make sure we got him.

693
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:39,669
Where are you going?

694
00:52:58,992 --> 00:52:59,924
Get back!

695
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:05,720
Come here!

696
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:08,595
-What are you doing?
-Saving your ass!

697
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:22,036
Shit!

698
00:53:22,415 --> 00:53:23,848
Johnson, behind you!

699
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:40,462
Goddamn it!

700
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,971
Stay with me!

701
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,861
James, open up!

702
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,504
Bruno!

703
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,209
Bruno!

704
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:32,711
Let's go!

705
00:54:57,444 --> 00:55:01,141
-How did they find us?
-Obviously you did something stupid.

706
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:23,559
That's good.

707
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:26,334
Hold it.

708
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,002
Engage power thrust, now!

709
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,201
Why don't you just give yourself up?

710
00:55:33,947 --> 00:55:37,713
-Engage the power thrust right now!
-Power thrust engaged.

711
00:55:59,806 --> 00:56:01,603
We lost them. We're good to go now.

712
00:56:01,674 --> 00:56:04,837
Who's going to pay for the damage
to the vehicle...

713
00:56:04,911 --> 00:56:07,209
...not to mention the caviar
and champagne?

714
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,508
I'll send you a check.

715
00:56:13,753 --> 00:56:14,651
Shit!

716
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:21,084
-Ram them.
-What?

717
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:22,185
Ram them!

718
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:29,896
Stay on them.

719
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:32,136
Okay!

720
00:56:45,752 --> 00:56:47,049
Go, go, go!

721
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,857
Die, die, Pluto Nash.

722
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:04,734
-I'm hit!
-Quiet!

723
00:57:04,904 --> 00:57:05,871
I'm hit!

724
00:57:08,408 --> 00:57:10,273
Bruno, you see that rill right there?

725
00:57:11,044 --> 00:57:12,602
No rills, please!

726
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:15,072
It's a clear approach and a perfect lip!

727
00:57:15,148 --> 00:57:17,241
-What's a rill?
-That's a rill!

728
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:23,622
Pluto.

729
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:26,983
-Are you crazy?
-Hold on!

730
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,192
Say when, Bruno!

731
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,159
Three, two, one...

732
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:32,362
...go!

733
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,841
Stop, stop!

734
00:58:13,973 --> 00:58:16,567
That's why they call us rill-hoppers.

735
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,734
I think I'm going to be sick.

736
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:22,581
Evacuate! Evacuate!

737
00:58:22,715 --> 00:58:23,875
Put your helmet on!

738
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,178
-Why?
-Hurry, get it on!

739
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,377
Where are you going?

740
00:58:26,452 --> 00:58:28,750
-Overboard, brother.
-It's been real, James.

741
00:58:28,821 --> 00:58:32,257
Great, so I'll just sit here
and blow up, shall I?

742
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:40,127
-Can we go home now?
-No!

743
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:41,628
Get us to the other side.

744
00:58:50,176 --> 00:58:51,165
All right.

745
00:58:51,978 --> 00:58:56,915
Even if they bailed out before the explosion,
they still couldn't survive out here, right?

746
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:00,982
Let's go.

747
00:59:01,588 --> 00:59:04,250
Excuse me, could you give me a lift?

748
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:08,190
I have some information
about the people that you're looking for.

749
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:13,493
Come back here!
I can help you find them, you bastards!

750
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:17,167
What do we do now?

751
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,732
We start walking.

752
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,102
We don't have any food or water.

753
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:25,208
We'll run out of air long before
we need food and water. Trust me.

754
01:00:03,983 --> 01:00:07,419
-I can't breathe.
-Come on, Dina, hang in there.

755
01:00:11,624 --> 01:00:12,989
Hang in there.

756
01:00:17,497 --> 01:00:18,657
Dina.

757
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,161
Dina.

758
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,345
Boss.

759
01:00:59,272 --> 01:01:00,603
Boss...

760
01:01:01,808 --> 01:01:03,639
...battery...

761
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:06,201
...Iow.

762
01:01:42,315 --> 01:01:43,805
Shit!

763
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,697
-Stay down or you'll pass out again.
-Okay.

764
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:06,767
You on a nature walk or something?

765
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:10,331
No, the thrusters on my vehicle blew out.

766
01:02:11,844 --> 01:02:13,675
What's going on? Where are we?

767
01:02:13,746 --> 01:02:16,510
It's okay. I just rescued you.
My name is Felix Laranga.

768
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:19,215
Felix, I'm Pluto and that's Dina.

769
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:20,374
Pluto?

770
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:22,779
-Pluto Nash?
-Yeah.

771
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:24,956
The Pluto Nash?

772
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,147
Yeah.

773
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,486
Get out of here, I'm your number one fan!

774
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:31,320
You're the reason
I got into the smuggling business.

775
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:35,891
Honey, let me tell you something.
This man is the Tito Puente of rill-hopping.

776
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,562
Right here, this is the guy.

777
01:02:39,205 --> 01:02:43,301
Could you bring my robot inside?
He needs to be recharged.

778
01:02:46,312 --> 01:02:50,442
Well, look, I had
a really bad robot experience once.

779
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:54,914
I had this fine robot mamita
and I rented her out...

780
01:02:55,154 --> 01:02:58,681
...took her back to my place,
we started getting busy.

781
01:02:58,958 --> 01:03:03,395
All of a sudden, there's a malfunction,
and bam! She does a Terminator on me.

782
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:07,491
Busted a couple of my ribs,
dislocated my shoulder.

783
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,395
I'm lucky I'm still alive.

784
01:03:09,735 --> 01:03:12,169
Don't worry about Bruno,
he's not going to hurt you.

785
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:15,171
As long as you don't try
to get busy with him.

786
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:20,373
Ordinarily, I'd say no.
But for Pluto Nash, I'll do anything.

787
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,340
I appreciate it.

788
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:25,382
You think you might be able
to give us a ride to Moon Beach?

789
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:28,745
Bro, I'll take you to Miami Beach
if that's where you got to go.

790
01:03:28,821 --> 01:03:30,015
I'll be right back.

791
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:05,920
Check it out.

792
01:04:06,158 --> 01:04:10,618
Lunar Grand Casino dice,
loaded and 100% undetectable.

793
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,256
You want a set, as a personal gift from me?

794
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,298
Thanks, but I'm not really a big gambler.

795
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,870
With those dice, you ain't gambling.

796
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,772
We're not going to gamble.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

797
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:27,238
If you're not a gambler,
why are you going to Moon Beach?

798
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:30,146
-I'm going to see an old friend of mine.
-Who's that?

799
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:31,442
Rex Crater.

800
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:34,344
Rex Crater is a friend of yours?

801
01:04:34,587 --> 01:04:35,849
Yeah, sure.

802
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:39,389
Can you comp me a suite
with a sunken living room bathtub...

803
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,256
...and a waterbed
with a mirror on the ceiling?

804
01:04:43,262 --> 01:04:44,490
Yeah, probably.

805
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:46,424
Damn!

806
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:49,428
Pluto Nash is down with Rex Crater.

807
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:07,946
You know what, Felix?

808
01:05:10,356 --> 01:05:13,450
Take these Hillarys.
We appreciate your helping us out.

809
01:05:13,526 --> 01:05:15,756
No, you my man. You don't got to do that.

810
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,388
Take this, you helped us out.
I appreciate it.

811
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:20,532
I'm all right. I'll tell you what.

812
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:23,435
-Would you sign my helmet for me?
-Get out of here.

813
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:26,437
-Come on, give me an autograph.
-Are you serious?

814
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:29,599
It's not every day I get to hang out
with Pluto Nash.

815
01:05:30,743 --> 01:05:32,677
-Please.
-Okay, I'll sign it.

816
01:05:32,912 --> 01:05:34,777
This is my first autograph.

817
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:37,106
What do you want me to sign?

818
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,340
"'To Felix...

819
01:05:39,418 --> 01:05:44,378
"'...my buddy, who stuck with me through
thick and thin, who I'll never forget."'

820
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:48,753
Bro, I just saved your life.

821
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:53,092
"'My buddy, who stuck with me
through thick and thin, and saved my ass.

822
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:55,559
"'Peace and love, Pluto Nash."'

823
01:05:57,269 --> 01:06:00,033
What's all that stuff you got
on the rack back there?

824
01:06:00,106 --> 01:06:03,405
That's a new shipment of stuff
I just smuggled in from Puerto Rico.

825
01:06:03,576 --> 01:06:04,702
Is that right?

826
01:06:04,777 --> 01:06:07,974
Top of the line, designer labels.
Why, you need something?

827
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,708
Yeah, we could use some clothes.

828
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:18,220
Welcome to Moon Beach
and the Lunar Grand Hotel...

829
01:06:18,591 --> 01:06:21,355
...where luck is always on your side.

830
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,563
Welcome to Moon Beach
and the Lunar Grand Hotel...

831
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:30,697
...where luck is always on your side.

832
01:06:36,942 --> 01:06:39,809
Bruno, lay low for a minute.
Go get a magazine or something.

833
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,172
Meet us over by the elevators.

834
01:06:44,283 --> 01:06:49,050
Hey, good-looking, how about slipping up
to your room and playing with me awhile?

835
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:52,655
Don't you want to do something
exciting tonight?

836
01:06:52,725 --> 01:06:53,749
No!

837
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:58,128
Afraid you might get lucky?

838
01:07:07,807 --> 01:07:08,796
Hello.

839
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:10,831
Good evening. Checking in?

840
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:13,037
Actually, we're here to see Tony Francis.

841
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,012
The early show or the late show?

842
01:07:15,214 --> 01:07:19,173
We're old friends. We come to see him
in person. Where's his dressing room?

843
01:07:19,485 --> 01:07:21,009
I can't tell you that, sir.

844
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:22,484
Really?

845
01:07:23,189 --> 01:07:26,556
Tell you what, just give us a room
and two tickets to the early show.

846
01:07:27,259 --> 01:07:30,319
All set. Just give me a thumb print
for the charges.

847
01:07:32,598 --> 01:07:34,293
I'll pay in cash.

848
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,467
Cash is always easier.

849
01:07:40,506 --> 01:07:42,872
Mr. Francis' show is black tie.

850
01:07:43,342 --> 01:07:45,742
We have rentals available
from the concierge.

851
01:07:46,011 --> 01:07:48,241
All prettied up for Tony? Absolutely.

852
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,947
Peekaboo, I found you. Come on, big boy...

853
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:58,156
...right here in the lobby! Oh, baby!

854
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,485
You sick bastard!

855
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,091
Security!

856
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,764
All set.

857
01:08:08,033 --> 01:08:09,364
Enjoy your stay.

858
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:12,130
Crazy-ass Tony!

859
01:08:14,807 --> 01:08:16,434
All right. So far, so good.

860
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:17,731
Come with us.

861
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,472
-What's the problem?
-ls he with you?

862
01:08:20,813 --> 01:08:23,611
Yes, he's my old friend from West Virginia.
What's going on?

863
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,508
Nice try.

864
01:08:25,885 --> 01:08:30,015
After you've paid for the damages
to this slot machine, we'll give Earl back.

865
01:08:30,089 --> 01:08:32,717
-Wait a second--
-Here's your claim check.

866
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:34,760
Pick your robot up when you leave.

867
01:08:34,994 --> 01:08:36,154
Let's go.

868
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,329
Sorry, boss.

869
01:08:39,565 --> 01:08:42,500
You're not a robot, you're an animal!

870
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:44,869
Line it up!

871
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,468
Yo, baby, you love me?
'Cause I love me, too!

872
01:08:52,845 --> 01:08:54,278
Come here, baby!

873
01:08:54,613 --> 01:08:57,639
I want bottles of champagne
for those people over there....

874
01:09:04,023 --> 01:09:06,423
You ready? Blow!

875
01:09:10,162 --> 01:09:12,289
Yo, Pluto! My man, Pluto Nash!

876
01:09:12,364 --> 01:09:13,956
Pluto Nash, come on!

877
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:18,201
Come here, Pluto.
I want to show you how to win big time!

878
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:22,764
Pluto, where are you going? Come on!
They're giving away $1,000 chips!

879
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,433
Come here!

880
01:09:26,612 --> 01:09:29,911
Mr. Belcher, Nash just walked in the lobby.

881
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,515
Nash is alive.

882
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,312
You idiots!

883
01:09:39,191 --> 01:09:40,954
All day, all day!

884
01:09:41,026 --> 01:09:42,721
Watch this, honey!

885
01:09:44,363 --> 01:09:45,921
Want a sip of champagne?

886
01:09:49,034 --> 01:09:49,796
Let's go.

887
01:09:49,869 --> 01:09:53,669
Give me those back.
Get your hands off me or I'll have you fired.

888
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:56,469
You know who I am? Felix Laranga!

889
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:57,533
Who?

890
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,703
You never heard of me
'cause you're stupid.

891
01:10:12,157 --> 01:10:16,594
Ladies and gentlemen,
the undisputed master of the universe...

892
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:19,256
...Mr. Tony Francis!

893
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:52,429
What an amazing act.
He's so different, so original.

894
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:53,720
Yeah.

895
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:01,537
What makes you so sure he'll help us out?

896
01:11:01,607 --> 01:11:04,440
He'll help us.
He couldn't sing a note if it weren't for me.

897
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,535
You taught Tony Francis how to sing?

898
01:11:06,745 --> 01:11:10,203
No, I convinced a bookie
not to pour some acid down his throat.

899
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:30,561
Pack your bags,
I'm taking you home with me!

900
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:33,329
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

901
01:11:33,405 --> 01:11:36,272
Please welcome the master
of musical disaster...

902
01:11:36,342 --> 01:11:39,004
...Ted Jefferies
and the Ted Jefferies Orchestra.

903
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,542
Hit it, maestro!

904
01:11:56,595 --> 01:11:59,155
There's a guy over there checking faces.

905
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:03,332
Turn towards me.

906
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:17,281
Okay, I think that worked.

907
01:12:21,153 --> 01:12:22,711
It worked for me.

908
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:33,364
You were so wonderful, Tony.
What a great show!

909
01:12:33,999 --> 01:12:36,365
It was a magnificent evening, wasn't it?

910
01:12:36,735 --> 01:12:38,862
Is this the refund window?

911
01:12:40,506 --> 01:12:44,772
Pluto Nash! My goodness, it's marvelous
to see you! How have you been?

912
01:12:44,843 --> 01:12:46,708
I'll tell you about it. This is Dina.

913
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:49,441
-I loved your show.
-Tony loves you for loving his show.

914
01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:51,881
I want you to meet my wives,
Gina and Filomena.

915
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,714
A pleasure to meet you, Pluto and Dina.

916
01:12:56,422 --> 01:12:58,583
My man, Anthony Frankowski!

917
01:12:58,824 --> 01:13:02,590
-It's Francis, not Frankowski.
-Your wives don't know you're Polish?

918
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:06,755
-Nobody knows. You'll blow my cover.
-All right, it's our little secret.

919
01:13:06,832 --> 01:13:08,459
You want to stay for dinner?

920
01:13:08,534 --> 01:13:13,471
We made osso buco and pork and gnocchi,
all Tony's mother's recipes.

921
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,300
No, thanks, we ate already.

922
01:13:17,109 --> 01:13:19,634
-You're a freak.
-You have no idea.

923
01:13:20,412 --> 01:13:22,505
Can I talk to you in private?

924
01:13:22,748 --> 01:13:25,410
Absolutely.
Would you excuse us for a minute?

925
01:13:25,784 --> 01:13:26,614
Sure!

926
01:13:26,952 --> 01:13:28,385
You married twins?

927
01:13:28,454 --> 01:13:31,753
They're not twins. I met the perfect woman
and I had her cloned.

928
01:13:32,024 --> 01:13:34,185
-Which one is which?
-Who cares?

929
01:13:35,227 --> 01:13:38,754
Me and your boss, Rex Crater,
we had a little misunderstanding.

930
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,560
What kind of misunderstanding?

931
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:43,100
He tried to have me killed
and he blew up my club.

932
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:45,227
-How do you know it was Crater?
-I know it.

933
01:13:45,304 --> 01:13:48,569
He offered to buy my club
and I wouldn't sell it, so they blew it up.

934
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,368
Shit.

935
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:51,102
You got to help me get to Crater.

936
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:55,044
-Babe, I'm fond of breathing, you dig?
-Just tell me how to get to him.

937
01:13:55,214 --> 01:13:58,445
I never even met him! He watches
my show from up in his penthouse.

938
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:02,749
He sends down these messages:
"'Your jokes suck. You walk like a peacock."'

939
01:14:02,821 --> 01:14:05,312
You wouldn't be singing
if it wasn't for me, right?

940
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,117
Come on, man.

941
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:13,063
I might know a way for you
to get up into his penthouse.

942
01:14:13,132 --> 01:14:16,158
-After that you're on your own, Pluto.
-Thanks.

943
01:14:16,335 --> 01:14:19,702
Pick up Bruno and pay the damages
on that slot machine.

944
01:14:19,771 --> 01:14:22,899
Rent a car and wait outside
the front entrance of the hotel.

945
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:24,736
I might have to make a fast getaway.

946
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:28,143
-But what if you don't get away?
-I always get away.

947
01:14:28,647 --> 01:14:30,672
Come on, we'll go this way.

948
01:14:33,285 --> 01:14:36,345
Rex Crater's private penthouse elevator
is right next to mine.

949
01:14:36,421 --> 01:14:40,357
There's a way for you
to get from my elevator into his.

950
01:14:42,661 --> 01:14:43,525
How you doing?

951
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:45,995
Trust me, you'll love this.

952
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,636
All right, here we go.
I'll stop this so nobody bothers us.

953
01:15:07,686 --> 01:15:10,484
-I gotta get that later.
-Shit!

954
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:13,320
That's Rex's elevator down there. See?

955
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,985
It only stops at the subbasement
and his penthouse.

956
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:18,222
My elevator only goes as low as this floor.

957
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:20,861
How do I get from one elevator
to the other one?

958
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,528
That's what Tony is here to help you with.
I'll tell you the whole thing.

959
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:29,404
Back up as far as you can go,
get a good running start, jump out across.

960
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:34,802
-Jump across to what?
-The ledge! See that ledge down there?

961
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,314
Grab onto these wires
and swing down onto the ledge.

962
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:41,348
-You want me to grab hot wires?
-How do you know they're hot?

963
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,546
Look, the shit is hot!

964
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:46,782
Grab the ones that aren't hot.
Swing down, get down to the ledge.

965
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:51,295
Then you wait an hour and a half
till they bring Rex's late supper up to him.

966
01:15:51,363 --> 01:15:54,764
When the elevator goes by,
before it passes you, you jump on top.

967
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,829
Use this casino chip to unscrew
the trapdoor on top of the elevator.

968
01:15:58,904 --> 01:16:02,897
Jump down inside and take out
the two robot guards, pop-pop!

969
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:06,741
Boom! You're alone in the elevator,
you got a meeting with Rex.

970
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:12,309
What's plan B?

971
01:16:14,786 --> 01:16:16,378
This is Plan B.

972
01:16:17,456 --> 01:16:20,254
I'm here to accept Mr. Crater's offer.

973
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:23,658
-ls that right?
-It's all settled. $10 million.

974
01:16:25,864 --> 01:16:30,460
-We'll have to get back to you on that.
-I got to get ready for my next show.

975
01:16:31,436 --> 01:16:32,494
Get them out of here.

976
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:36,132
Sorry, your robot remains property
of this casino...

977
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:39,143
...until the damages
to our slot machines are taken care of.

978
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:40,803
I'm here to pay you.

979
01:16:41,613 --> 01:16:43,604
Repairs hasn't sent down a bill yet.

980
01:16:44,716 --> 01:16:48,948
You would be a real peach
if you could get me that bill.

981
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:58,625
Harry, I got a Bruno '63 Deluxe.

982
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,723
Wrecked a slot machine.
Owner wants to pick him up.

983
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,858
How much they owe?

984
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:05,630
I haven't even looked
at the damn thing yet.

985
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,501
Have him check with us tomorrow morning.

986
01:17:07,572 --> 01:17:09,039
What are they saying?

987
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:11,675
You'll be spending the night.

988
01:17:12,311 --> 01:17:14,108
It's been fun.

989
01:17:21,753 --> 01:17:23,152
Excuse me.

990
01:17:27,259 --> 01:17:30,023
-I got to take a leak.
-Robots don't take leaks.

991
01:17:32,864 --> 01:17:34,525
You're absolutely right.

992
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,223
Come on.

993
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:40,201
We need to get a car.

994
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,399
What are you in such a hurry for?

995
01:17:52,718 --> 01:17:55,050
You wanted to talk to Mr. Crater?

996
01:17:55,687 --> 01:17:56,676
Here you are.

997
01:18:02,994 --> 01:18:05,554
I finally get to meet the great Rex Crater?

998
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:07,456
Or is it Mike Marucci?

999
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:09,426
Yeah, Mike Marucci.

1000
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:12,061
Thought you were so damn smart,
I figured you out.

1001
01:18:12,404 --> 01:18:15,896
I should come over there
and put my foot in your fat grease-ball ass.

1002
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,610
So you got it all figured out, huh?

1003
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,634
It is a pleasure to meet me.

1004
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:52,099
I'm pretty feisty, huh?

1005
01:18:52,677 --> 01:18:54,611
What's this, a rented tuxedo?

1006
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,346
You know, you're old enough
to own your own tuxedo.

1007
01:18:57,416 --> 01:19:00,249
Sit down! You know,
you should be honored.

1008
01:19:00,852 --> 01:19:04,344
Only person besides yourself
to ever come up here is Belcher over there.

1009
01:19:06,725 --> 01:19:08,090
What's going on here?

1010
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,652
Remember when they cut your appendix
out eight years ago in prison?

1011
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:15,364
Gambling had just been outlawed on Earth,
so my old boss...

1012
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:19,996
...Mike Marucci, commissioned
Dr. Runa Pedanken to create a clone...

1013
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:22,869
...of someone
who knew their way around the Moon.

1014
01:19:23,275 --> 01:19:24,207
For what?

1015
01:19:24,276 --> 01:19:28,508
He was starting a gambling operation
and needed someone to front for him.

1016
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,110
Someone intelligent, that he could control.

1017
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,641
A puppet.

1018
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:38,615
That didn't jive with my career plan
so I sent Marucci and Pedanken into orbit.

1019
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:43,016
Then, for sentimental reasons,
or because I'm a nice guy, I let you live.

1020
01:19:44,329 --> 01:19:46,320
Until you got in my way.

1021
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,895
Let's face it, why should I keep you around?

1022
01:19:50,969 --> 01:19:54,166
For what? I got your good looks,
your charm and your wit.

1023
01:19:54,573 --> 01:19:56,336
I even got your memories.

1024
01:19:56,775 --> 01:19:59,642
-You got my memories?
-Yeah.

1025
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:03,044
Never wondered how my people knew
to look for you in your hideout?

1026
01:20:03,114 --> 01:20:06,641
Or the Paradise Motel, which,
by the way, is a disgusting establishment.

1027
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:09,516
I'm surprised you didn't break
into a rash after staying there.

1028
01:20:09,588 --> 01:20:12,250
Next time I'll remember
to find better accommodations.

1029
01:20:12,324 --> 01:20:14,315
Mr. Mogan and Mr. Kelp have arrived, sir.

1030
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:16,519
Yes. By all means, send them in.

1031
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,461
Mr. Mogan and Mr. Kelp.

1032
01:20:18,697 --> 01:20:21,131
I've been waiting for those two gentlemen.

1033
01:20:33,845 --> 01:20:35,210
-Boss?
-Quiet.

1034
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,338
Hey, everybody!

1035
01:20:37,215 --> 01:20:38,614
Nash.

1036
01:20:39,017 --> 01:20:41,884
-What's Nash doing here?
-No, I'm Rex Crater.

1037
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,853
No, you're Pluto Nash.

1038
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:47,119
No, I beg to differ. I'm Rex Crater.

1039
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,290
This is Pluto Nash.

1040
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:55,992
Oh, my God.

1041
01:20:56,067 --> 01:20:58,228
Isn't it something? But enough about him.

1042
01:20:58,303 --> 01:21:02,535
Mr. Mogan, I want to personally thank you
for the outstanding job you've done.

1043
01:21:03,675 --> 01:21:05,040
Thank you, sir.

1044
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:07,273
It was a pleasure and an honor.

1045
01:21:07,379 --> 01:21:12,214
You see, when you have the experience
me and my men have, it's quite easy--

1046
01:21:15,987 --> 01:21:17,079
Oh, shit.

1047
01:21:17,422 --> 01:21:19,413
Incompetent jackasses.

1048
01:21:22,494 --> 01:21:23,961
Get them out of here.

1049
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:33,036
I'd love to let you hang around
so you can entertain me...

1050
01:21:33,104 --> 01:21:35,572
...but we might have a conflict of interest.

1051
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,905
But there's something I want you to see
before I say bye-bye to you.

1052
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:56,215
Look at that.

1053
01:21:56,861 --> 01:22:00,888
An excellent piece of real estate, but
you never took advantage of its potential.

1054
01:22:01,066 --> 01:22:02,192
This--

1055
01:22:04,903 --> 01:22:06,165
This is wrong.

1056
01:22:06,237 --> 01:22:09,331
That should say Rex's,
because this is Rex's.

1057
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:12,999
Little America's most exclusive new casino!

1058
01:22:13,311 --> 01:22:15,302
Tell me, what do you think?

1059
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:34,226
Little America is not a gambling town
and Pluto's isn't a casino.

1060
01:22:34,299 --> 01:22:38,167
I think you're a clown and you should
take all this stupid casino shit out.

1061
01:22:38,236 --> 01:22:40,431
If you get your dumb-ass name
off the front...

1062
01:22:40,505 --> 01:22:42,837
...maybe you'll be in business
for more than a week.

1063
01:22:44,776 --> 01:22:47,336
-Sorry, it's not wood, is it?
-Yes, and it's hand-carved!

1064
01:22:47,412 --> 01:22:48,640
Sorry! I'm sorry!

1065
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,374
Pick that shit up!

1066
01:22:50,815 --> 01:22:51,782
Shit.

1067
01:23:15,206 --> 01:23:16,935
Hold it, right there, robot.

1068
01:23:26,317 --> 01:23:27,716
Which one's Pluto?

1069
01:23:27,886 --> 01:23:29,046
Which one's Rex?

1070
01:24:00,819 --> 01:24:02,013
Belcher!

1071
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,815
-Shoot him, Belcher!
-Shoot him, Belcher!

1072
01:24:10,328 --> 01:24:11,317
Damn it!

1073
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:24,241
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

1074
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,039
Don't aim at me, he's Nash! Shoot him!

1075
01:24:27,112 --> 01:24:29,842
He's not me, I'm me! He's him!
Shoot him!

1076
01:24:29,914 --> 01:24:32,212
Boss, which one is you?

1077
01:24:32,283 --> 01:24:33,045
Pluto?

1078
01:24:33,118 --> 01:24:35,279
Idiots! He's the one in the rented tuxedo!

1079
01:24:35,353 --> 01:24:36,183
Rex!

1080
01:24:36,287 --> 01:24:37,276
Boss?

1081
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:40,449
-It's him!
-This piece of shit belongs to him!

1082
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:45,553
Now shoot him!

1083
01:25:00,145 --> 01:25:03,478
-What's the matter with you guys?
-lt was hairy there for a minute.

1084
01:25:03,548 --> 01:25:04,742
Hairy for you?

1085
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,417
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

1086
01:25:07,752 --> 01:25:09,413
Hairy, my ass.

1087
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,318
You sing, don't you?

1088
01:25:11,623 --> 01:25:13,989
You're a singer, right? I got a job for you.

1089
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:16,687
Just kill me and get it over with.

1090
01:25:16,761 --> 01:25:20,788
You're going to work, but not singing.
Waiting tables, six nights a week.

1091
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:24,232
If you're lucky and save your tips,
maybe you'll get back to Utah.

1092
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,136
Pluto.

1093
01:25:31,943 --> 01:25:34,537
I didn't scare you, did l? You all right?

1094
01:25:37,182 --> 01:25:38,171
Boss!

1095
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:41,208
I was hoping it was you.

1096
01:25:43,755 --> 01:25:46,485
Never leave home
without an undershirt, right?

1097
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:49,783
Isn't that what you always say?

1098
01:25:50,195 --> 01:25:53,323
Never leave home without an undershirt.
That's rule number one.

1099
01:25:53,832 --> 01:25:54,890
I agree!

1100
01:26:18,556 --> 01:26:20,285
Craps, you lose!

1101
01:26:48,019 --> 01:26:50,852
For the grand reopening of Club Pluto...

1102
01:26:51,055 --> 01:26:54,218
...please welcome Miss Dina Lake!

1103
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,808
Pluto!

1104
01:27:15,346 --> 01:27:17,211
Pluto, baby!

1105
01:27:17,515 --> 01:27:19,676
Fantastic club! Great joint, baby.

1106
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:22,379
Thanks a lot. Let me say
that the Mrs. Francis'...

1107
01:27:22,921 --> 01:27:25,856
-...are looking lovely tonight.
-Thank you, Pluto.

1108
01:27:25,924 --> 01:27:27,858
-Have a good time.
-All right, baby.

1109
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:31,356
Did I tell you ladies how I got Pluto
started in the business?

1110
01:27:31,429 --> 01:27:32,896
Tell us, Tony.

1111
01:27:33,031 --> 01:27:36,797
What about a ham sandwich without
the cheese? How much would that be?

1112
01:27:37,135 --> 01:27:38,102
Free!

1113
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:41,969
Felix Laranga's money is no good here.
Knock yourself out, whatever you want.

1114
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,234
Thanks, Pluto!

1115
01:27:43,308 --> 01:27:45,970
Pluto Nash, I love that man!

1116
01:27:46,077 --> 01:27:51,208
Honey, I tell you what: Eight steaks,
a crate of lobsters, shrimp cocktail...

1117
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:54,510
...onion rings, fries, a doggy bag to go....

1118
01:28:06,064 --> 01:28:08,032
How is it going with you and Babette?

1119
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:11,193
Me and Babette?
I don't think it's gonna happen.

1120
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:15,100
I found out that I'm 1 10 volts
and she's a 220.

1121
01:28:15,173 --> 01:28:17,334
Go to the hardware store
and get an adapter.

1122
01:28:18,409 --> 01:28:21,537
No. That just ruins it for me.

1123
01:28:22,246 --> 01:28:24,237
I guess it wasn't meant to be, huh?

1124
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:27,250
Bruno, you see my new bodyguard
running around here?

1125
01:28:29,287 --> 01:28:33,087
-New bodyguard?
-I bought a '78, fully loaded, out the door.

1126
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,049
Shall I begin disassembling myself?

1127
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:39,355
If you do that, how will you manage
my club in 500 pieces?

1128
01:28:39,664 --> 01:28:43,760
Manage? But no robot
has ever been in management.

1129
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:45,096
You want the job or not?

1130
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:47,066
Oh, boss!

1131
01:28:47,338 --> 01:28:49,101
Oh, thank you, boss!

1132
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:51,804
You're the best boss on the whole Moon!

1133
01:28:53,544 --> 01:28:56,069
You almost broke my ribs.

1134
01:28:57,048 --> 01:29:00,245
Pull up a chair. Let's sit back
and celebrate and enjoy the party.

1135
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:05,022
Sorry, no can do. We've got a pile of bills,
the payroll is tomorrow.

1136
01:29:05,156 --> 01:29:07,920
We need a new doorman
and we're low on shrimp.

1137
01:29:07,992 --> 01:29:09,823
I'm swamped!
