1
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,251
As I was going up the stair

2
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,222
I met a man who wasn't there

3
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,622
I met a man who wasn't there

4
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,287
He wasn't there again today

5
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:35,630
I wish
I wish he'd go away

6
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,764
Where did you learn that?

7
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,305
Where did you learn that poem?

8
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,841
I made it up.

9
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,447
When I was a kid, I made it up.

10
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,249
What else do you remember
from back then?

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,852
Don't beat around the bush, doc.
Don't beat around the bush.

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,058
Don't beat around the bush.
Don't beat around the bush, doc!

13
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,673
Tell me what you remember
about your mother.

14
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,499
I remember my mom.

15
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,843
I remember my mom.

16
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,040
I remember my mom was a whore.

17
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,435
How long would she keep you there?

18
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,997
As long as she was busy.

19
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,381
Do you understand
why you're talking with me now?

20
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,214
You're supposed to be good with...

21
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,545
...headaches.

22
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,293
I need something more than aspirin.
Know what I mean?

23
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:13,489
Do you remember the murders?

24
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,428
I remember...

25
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:21,766
...that Columbia is the capital
of South Carolina.

26
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,904
I remember that--

27
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,521
Are you the person
who murdered six residents...

28
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:43,184
...of the Lakeworth Apartments
on May 10, 1998?

29
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,198
That's my birthday.

30
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,700
Who am I speaking to right now?

31
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,909
What should I call you?

32
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,414
Call me whatever you want.

33
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,760
Gary?

34
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,661
Gary?

35
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,260
Gary, you awake?

36
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,929
Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact,
I am awake.

37
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,904
I'm sorry to bother you at home...

38
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,341
...but there's gonna be a midnight
hearing in the Rivers case.

39
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,415
The defense found a notebook
misfiled in evidence, a diary.

40
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,484
They argued to the state Supremes
that it was suppressed.

41
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,116
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,588
There's no media.
This all happened under the radar.

43
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,193
The prisoner transport
left an hour ago from Ely.

44
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,525
Left Ely? What do you mean?
What transport?

45
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:55,531
The diary gave them an opening
to argue insanity again.

46
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:59,137
They need Rivers present, so they
drugged him, put him on a transport.

47
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,466
They're taking this scumbag
to a hearing...

48
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,472
...the night before his execution.

49
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,873
How the fuck did you let that happen?

50
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,882
Would anyone like to play
another round?

51
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,950
Let's get another puzzle,
Vanna. What do we have?

52
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,557
-"Around the House" is the category.
-Buy a vowel.

53
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,556
-Buy a vowel.
-Pick up that trip.

54
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,856
-Buy a vowel, you idiot.
-I'd like to buy a vowel. An E.

55
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,424
One E.

56
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,002
-All right, 350 left.
-N.

57
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,600
-Buy a vowel.
-Buy another vowel.

58
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,674
-Yes!
-An I.

59
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,138
-I'd like to solve.
-Sure.

60
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,784
"Kibbles 'n Bits. "

61
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,818
She won't stop bleeding.
She won't stop bleeding.

62
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:57,326
-Jesus. What happened?
-An accident. We had an accident.

63
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,658
Rain and lightning
is moving into Elko.

64
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,268
Doppler Radar has picked up a
severe thunderstorm with lightning...

65
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,836
...on its way from Pershing
and Lander counties.

66
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,769
-We could get damaging winds....
-Four times 10 equals--

67
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,203
Four times 10--

68
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:14,540
Timothy, could you not do that now?
We're trying to hear about the storm.

69
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,346
-Sure you don't want me to drive?
-No.

70
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:23,251
I'll get us to Anderson,
then you can take over after we eat.

71
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,090
Turn into spin.

72
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,598
Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.

73
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,361
Check mirror and gauge indicator
and roll...

74
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,234
...to a slow, smooth stop.

75
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,500
You okay, honey? Timothy?

76
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,243
Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.

77
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,050
-It's a shoe.
-What?

78
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,522
It's a shoe!

79
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,571
For he's a jolly good fellow

80
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:26,377
For he's a jolly good fellow

81
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:33,014
For he's a jolly good fellow

82
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:41,556
Which nobody can deny

83
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,175
Shit!

84
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,956
-Why didn't we get a better spare?
-Do you know what radials cost, Alice?

85
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,682
Honey, don't get defensive.

86
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:10,453
Well, if the point is to put him,
Timothy, into the right school...

87
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,962
-...it's absurd to focus...
-George? George?

88
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,657
-...on replacement tires.
-What can I do to help?

89
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,601
Nothing. I'm fine, but...

90
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,131
...thank you.

91
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,861
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Alice?

92
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,502
Oh, my God! Alice?
What have you done?

93
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,210
What have you done?
What have you done?

94
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,151
Hi, Harry.
Where do I begin?

95
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:13,348
I have walked off the set, okay?

96
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,687
I know they'll say
that I am in breach...

97
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:18,796
...but they clearly
did not read my deal.

98
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:21,262
They had me at a Ramada--

99
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,129
Oh, Jesus.

100
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,200
I think I have a spare battery
in my bag.

101
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,604
Excuse me?

102
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,838
I have a spare battery in my bag
up front, next to you.

103
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:41,476
-Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?
-The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.

104
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,623
I don't see anything--

105
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,957
Just use your fucking eyes!
It's in the side pocket! Just look!

106
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,393
Jesus!

107
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,373
What have you done?
What have you done?

108
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,911
No, fool! If you help him,
you assume responsibility.

109
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,615
It is my responsibility.
Let go of me.

110
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,418
Alice? Alice?

111
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,782
What have you done?
What have you done?

112
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,716
Let me take a look.

113
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:24,192
The driver of every motor vehicle
involved in any manner of accident...

114
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:28,163
...originating from the operation
of a vehicle shall, within 10 days....

115
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,666
You got a towel or something
in the car?

116
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,532
Okay. Come help me look.

117
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,666
--within 10 days of the accident...

118
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:41,176
...if you are operating a vehicle
and it should, at any time, involve--

119
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:45,613
-Stay here. Keep her dry.
-It's okay. It's okay, honey.

120
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,018
-Open the door! We need the phone.
-No!

121
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,820
Sweetheart, it's okay.

122
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,720
Honey, it's okay.

123
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,922
-Give me the goddamn phone!
-The phone is dead, all right?

124
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,536
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay.

125
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,104
No!

126
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,067
-She won't stop bleeding.
-Jesus. What happened?

127
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,034
There was an accident.
May I please use your phone?

128
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,266
-Please use your phone?
-Yeah, sure.

129
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,844
Shit. I'm not getting a line.
It happens in the rain.

130
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,209
The phone doesn't work.

131
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,375
St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency,
30 miles east.

132
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:56,547
Okay.

133
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,751
You sit here, okay?

134
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:05,087
Keep pressure on the wound.
I'll be back with an ambulance.

135
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,033
What are you doing?

136
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,474
Sorry. It's a step down
from the Ramada, but it'll have to do.

137
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,637
I am not staying here.
Are you out of your mind?

138
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:27,616
This is my car. You work for me.
Get those bags back in this car now!

139
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:34,216
I understand the bleeding person
has a medical condition, but so do I.

140
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:39,888
My lung walls have depleted cilia.
If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!

141
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:47,832
No, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

142
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,405
Please!

143
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,114
Hey!

144
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,385
Stop. Please, please.

145
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,457
Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck.
Can I get a ride?

146
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,429
Okay.

147
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,544
You know you're going east.

148
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,686
Hospital's this way.

149
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:44,124
It's flooded.
I mean, it's a dead end.

150
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,899
Yeah, well, if you don't mind,
I gotta try.

151
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,997
Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.

152
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,042
Didn't you use to be that actress?

153
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,720
Yes.

154
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,659
-Wow.
-Now, is that a nice room?

155
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:21,197
Because though I am leaving soon,
I still would prefer a nice room.

156
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,393
Your nicest...

157
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,538
...if that is possible.

158
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,507
Eight's very cozy.

159
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:48,048
I tried to tell you.

160
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:54,093
Hey! Hey, stop!
There's no way through.

161
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,962
There's no way through!
No way through!

162
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,569
-Lou, wake up.
-What?

163
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,762
Cell phone.

164
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,964
-What?
-Do you have a cell phone?

165
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,541
Who wants to know?

166
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,906
There's been an accident,
a bad one. A lady's hurt.

167
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,981
-We need a cell phone right now.
-Dude, slow down.

168
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,608
First, we don't know who you are.
Second, we don't see an accident--

169
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,484
Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really
fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.

170
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,125
So if you have a cell phone,
give it to me now!

171
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:26,731
Dude, we don't have a cell phone,
so could you just let go of me now?!

172
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,064
I need you to give me a lift
in the other direction.

173
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:34,831
It's flooded that way too.
It's worse than this.

174
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,640
Ginny, pop the trunk.
Let them in.

175
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:41,903
Let them in.

176
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,031
Hey. How you doing?

177
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,503
-Phone still dead?
-Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?

178
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,271
Stuck in a run-off two miles down
the road. The other way's fucked too.

179
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,437
The kids gave us a lift.
The girl was stranded.

180
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,417
-Is there another way out?
-Is she a hooker?

181
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,212
Hey! Is there a back road?

182
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:23,911
Where do you think the water's going?
You wouldn't get 500 feet.

183
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,718
-How's the woman?
-I don't know. They're in number 4.

184
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,976
I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms
by the hour.

185
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,145
Funny. You still serving food?

186
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:55,377
Vending machines are around
the corner. Go ahead.

187
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,991
Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with
picture ID. You need one room or two?

188
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,754
Excuse me. I was talking to you.
I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.

189
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,021
Well, I don't like looking at trash.

190
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,901
We're a little stuck here, George.
I don't think we can get out tonight.

191
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:23,810
-She just keeps shaking.
-She's in shock.

192
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,382
-Let me take a look.
-What?

193
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,112
Let me take a look.

194
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,197
Did your wife pack a sewing kit?

195
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:48,540
No.

196
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,871
No.

197
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:56,479
Ginny, wait up.

198
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,112
Six.

199
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:05,383
At least we got a good number.

200
00:17:51,383 --> 00:17:55,012
-Did you feel that?
-Feel what?

201
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:56,988
Cold.

202
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:12,332
Are you the manager?

203
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,494
Yeah.

204
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:19,773
I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections.
I'm transporting a prisoner here.

205
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:22,845
The law gives you the right
to refuse us service...

206
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,448
...but the roads are flooded.
I could use a room.

207
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:29,052
-It's an emergency.
-You got a radio in that car?

208
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,347
-Who's this?
-Limo driver, had an accident.

209
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:34,685
I got a lady pretty banged up.
I could use an ambulance.

210
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:37,726
Four-four-two requesting medical.

211
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:40,591
Four-four-two requesting medical.

212
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:43,495
Nothing. It's been like this
for the past hour.

213
00:18:43,668 --> 00:18:46,102
She's losing a lot of blood.
Got a first aid kit?

214
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,635
Band-Aids, that's it.

215
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:50,399
-How about a needle and thread?
-Maybe in the diner.

216
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:55,103
I'll get it. Locked up.
Stay dry.

217
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:57,906
I'll be back with your key.
I'll put you in 10.

218
00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:01,347
-Okay, thanks.
-What do you got back there?

219
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,646
Prison transfer.

220
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:07,154
Maybe when you get him situated,
come to 4 and look at the lady.

221
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:10,556
-I could use a second opinion.
-Yeah, sure.

222
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:21,267
Looks like you're fucked.

223
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:23,401
Shut up!

224
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:40,051
-I wish I had beige.
-This is fine.

225
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:42,590
Would have been better.

226
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,558
I gotta get the officer situated.
Let me know if you need something.

227
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,721
I'll be right back.

228
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:56,735
Where did you learn to do that?

229
00:19:57,174 --> 00:19:59,938
Pretty much where you're standing.

230
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:15,657
Hey, is the...?

231
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:19,329
The little boy, is he all right?

232
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:21,931
He hasn't said a word
since the accident.

233
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:26,661
No, no, no. He doesn't talk much
ever since the....

234
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:31,540
I'm his stepfather.

235
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,836
His father....

236
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,637
Two years ago, he left.

237
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:41,649
Little temper problem.

238
00:20:57,635 --> 00:20:59,660
Watch your step.

239
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:08,176
The furniture's for shit.

240
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:12,680
If you're fixing to cuff him to
something, the toilet's bolted down.

241
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,750
Thank you so much
for your assistance.

242
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,683
-It's a good idea. Come on.
-I got stripes

243
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:22,258
Stripes around my shoulders
And these chains

244
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,724
These chains
They're about to--

245
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,596
Let's go look at that lady.

246
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:37,339
-You get anyone?
-What?

247
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:41,040
-Did you get through?
-No, not yet.

248
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:48,979
Good stitch job.

249
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:54,753
Pulse is shallow, but steady.
Keep her comfortable.

250
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:57,416
We should take turns on the radio,
if that's all right.

251
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,759
No, it's not. I can manage.

252
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:19,941
You gonna arrest me, officer?

253
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,455
What?

254
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:29,893
How'd you do that?
How'd you know I was a cop?

255
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:35,763
No shit.

256
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:40,996
Cheetos for dinner, huh?

257
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:44,733
-That don't seem right.
-You got a better idea?

258
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,141
I worked mess in the service.
Maybe the diner's open. I could--

259
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:52,305
You got change for a dollar?

260
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,842
I don't know. Let me see.

261
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:07,587
Here you go.

262
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,963
You got a name?

263
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:15,101
-Paris.
-Paris, huh?

264
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:16,569
I'll get it.

265
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:18,936
Never been.

266
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,273
Well, you ain't going tonight.

267
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:34,657
Please.

268
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:37,555
Please be strong.

269
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:41,995
You see, Timothy and I...

270
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,532
...we need you.

271
00:23:45,136 --> 00:23:47,798
We need you so much.

272
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:48,460
Lou?

273
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:53,026
Lou?

274
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:27,165
You need to tell them, Harry,
that I can't work, I can't perform...

275
00:25:27,338 --> 00:25:30,205
...I can't shine living
in an environment like that.

276
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:34,811
No, it is not about the money.
It's about the working conditions.

277
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:08,377
One bar.

278
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,913
One bar.

279
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:12,275
No bar.

280
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,808
One bar.

281
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:16,145
Two bars.

282
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:20,421
Come on. Come on.

283
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:22,821
Here we go.

284
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:28,028
There you go. Come on.

285
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:34,462
Goddamn desert wasteland!

286
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:46,372
Oh, shit! I just had it.

287
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:30,902
Holy fuck.

288
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:04,302
-Jesus, Mother of God.
-Who is this?

289
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:07,739
The woman I was driving.

290
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:13,844
-What the hell are you doing?
-There's something in there.

291
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:16,110
-Use this, man.
-Thanks.

292
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:19,483
-Are you a cop?
-I was.

293
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:30,530
-She was in Room 10?
-I am.

294
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:36,263
-Where's your guy?
-Cuffed to a toilet.

295
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,477
Son of a bitch.

296
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:52,186
That was a fucking drive.

297
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:59,362
-Gentlemen.
-Your Honor.

298
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:09,433
Ready, Sharon? Alrighty.

299
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:13,042
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada,
for the purposes of--

300
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,807
Judge Taylor, sir, with due respect,
we should wait till my client arrives.

301
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:23,242
-He has a right to be present.
-He has precious few rights.

302
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,320
He's 24 hours from execution.

303
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:29,415
But to demonstrate his
mental state, which is the purpose--
His mental state?

304
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:31,658
His mental state?

305
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:33,992
His mental state?

306
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:38,524
Do you know what time it is?
You think I got time for bullshit?

307
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:42,297
That the justices called me in the
middle of the night to review a case...

308
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:46,909
...I already sat on, that I already
decided, may make you happy.

309
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:49,136
But it pisses me off.

310
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:53,281
When your boy gets here, do what you
want, but in the name of decency...

311
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,010
...state your goddamn case!

312
00:32:57,854 --> 00:32:59,981
Yes, sir.

313
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:02,182
Somebody get me
a cup of coffee, black.

314
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:11,994
All right, everybody! Listen up!

315
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:14,596
There was an incident tonight.

316
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:16,864
That's police talk for,
"Someone's head got lopped off."

317
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,439
Larry!

318
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,836
-Caroline Suzanne was murdered.
-What?

319
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:26,744
-Who's Caroline Suzanne?
-The actress I was driving.

320
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:30,148
And where exactly did that happen?

321
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,551
We don't know, because
we can't find the body.

322
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:35,190
Not all of it anyway.

323
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,422
-What do you mean, you can't find it?
-Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

324
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:44,533
Officer Rhodes is outside.
He was transporting a convict.

325
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:47,261
-Who escaped.
-What are you--?

326
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:50,270
-Hold on.
-Running free!

327
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,874
Will you shut the fuck
up so he can talk?

328
00:33:53,043 --> 00:33:56,012
This is my place, ho!
I'll say what I please!

329
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:57,806
-It's safe here.
-It is not safe here!

330
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:59,881
-There's a cop here.
-Yeah, two cops.

331
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,711
You're a cop?

332
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:07,447
-I was. Shut up, Larry!
-It's not safe here! I'm not staying--

333
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:10,552
It's all right. It's okay.

334
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:14,256
Nothing.

335
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:17,662
-Is she okay?
-Ginny.

336
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:22,098
Ginny, will you...?
Stop it. Don't do this right now.

337
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:25,839
-What are you doing?
-Put your arm around your girlfriend.

338
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:30,070
-Actually, she's my wife.
-Everybody just stay here.

339
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:33,307
-Stay in this room.
-Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.

340
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,107
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

341
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:38,812
-I'm not.
-All right. Larry?

342
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,422
-Come with us.
-Why?

343
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,591
-You know the place.
-Here's what I know. I'm not a cop.

344
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,354
I don't take orders from
a professional slut!

345
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:49,688
-Fuck you!
-Listen. Just stay here, please.

346
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:51,527
Keep everybody calm.

347
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:03,204
He's not gonna get too far.
Not in this!

348
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,972
Rhodes!

349
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:08,842
What are we chasing here?

350
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,519
Multiple homicide.

351
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:18,361
I'll go around this way.
Meet you in back.

352
00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:34,634
Is that where you live
full-time? Las Vegas?

353
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:39,044
-Used to.
-What's that supposed to mean?

354
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:44,014
It means I don't live there anymore.

355
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,952
Maine!

356
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:27,190
We'll go see if we can use this one.
We'll go in here.

357
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:30,891
Since that wasn't a successful
attempt, we'll go in here.

358
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:35,729
I'll be right out here. It's okay.
I'm gonna stand guard.

359
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:40,807
Not a worry. I'll be right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

360
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:51,916
See, his mother usually does this.

361
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:17,745
Hey, Ginny. So how long
you two been married?

362
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:21,816
About nine hours. It was
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

363
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:24,147
Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?

364
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:27,783
-We need to leave!
-I was just talking to her.

365
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,586
Something's happening!
I need to get out of here!

366
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,993
-Ginny! Ginny!
-You don't own me, Lou!

367
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,464
I own what's inside you!
Half, at least.

368
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:41,570
You don't own any part
of me or my baby!

369
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:43,535
Then why did I marry you?

370
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,702
-Don't slam the goddamn door on me!
-Hey! Hey!

371
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:51,369
You guys, just calm down!

372
00:37:57,654 --> 00:38:02,023
We are not leaving.
There is no place else to go.

373
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:06,219
There's a flood outside,
Ginny. Stop it! Stop it!

374
00:38:06,396 --> 00:38:09,263
I'm not pregnant!

375
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:15,769
What did you just say?

376
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:20,907
I lied.

377
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,307
I'm not pregnant.

378
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,613
What are you talking about?
I saw the test.

379
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:37,317
Why would you do that to me?

380
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:42,530
Because Alison saw you at
The Hawk with that fucking girl!

381
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:50,866
-Ginny, what are we, like 15?
-Go away!

382
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:54,607
Goddamn!

383
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:16,962
-Open this goddamn door, Ginny!
-No!

384
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:19,966
I haven't been to The Hawk
in over a fucking year.

385
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:25,904
Alison is a stupid bitch-whore,
who likes fucking with your head.

386
00:39:26,076 --> 00:39:28,374
Open the damn door, Ginny.

387
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:32,411
-Open the fucking door!
-Not until you calm down!

388
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:36,650
I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!

389
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:48,797
What are you doing?

390
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:54,632
Lou?

391
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:13,150
Ginny, open this damn door!
Open the door!

392
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:16,454
-Open the door!
-Stop it, stop it!

393
00:40:17,594 --> 00:40:22,088
Ginny, damn it, open the door!
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!

394
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:24,699
Lou, please stop!

395
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:05,005
Lou?

396
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:50,585
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

397
00:41:50,753 --> 00:41:53,551
Help me! Somebody help me!

398
00:42:01,598 --> 00:42:03,964
Help me!

399
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:07,792
Help me! Somebody help me!

400
00:42:08,204 --> 00:42:11,867
Is he in there? Is he in there?

401
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:17,037
Ginny, are you okay?
What happened? What happened?

402
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:26,779
-Oh, shit.
-Jesus Christ.

403
00:42:35,164 --> 00:42:38,224
Lou? Lou?

404
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:41,462
What's going on?

405
00:44:04,187 --> 00:44:05,552
What the hell?

406
00:44:08,725 --> 00:44:10,590
Oh, shit!

407
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:14,990
Come here!

408
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:33,513
They caught him. They caught him.

409
00:44:41,657 --> 00:44:44,057
Why are we keeping him in here?

410
00:44:44,861 --> 00:44:48,024
-Where would you prefer, Larry?
-I don't know.

411
00:44:48,297 --> 00:44:50,925
I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?
Did I tell you that?

412
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,867
They got in a fight! I tried to
get them to go back inside!

413
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:58,803
Should we try the radio again?

414
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,908
Larry, just stay here and watch him.

415
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:06,606
-Go back and look after Ginny.
-Where are you going?

416
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:09,611
Just do it, please.

417
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,748
Ed?

418
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:18,153
I don't know if I'm comfortable
with guard duty, per se.

419
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:21,991
He's unconscious, Larry.
He's tied to a post.

420
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,676
Timmy.

421
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,639
Timmy.

422
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:04,391
Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?

423
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,095
I don't remember anything.

424
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,392
We had an accident

425
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,861
George? Can you keep
an eye on Ginny for a minute?

426
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:21,372
She's awake now. I have
to get some aspirin to help her.

427
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,876
Darling, I gotta go get
something out of my room.

428
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:45,430
-Shit!
-What's wrong, buddy?

429
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,900
What do you got in the fridge?

430
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,501
-You shut up.
-What's in there?

431
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,572
What's in there?

432
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,715
-What do you got in there?
-Shut up.

433
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,947
What is it, huh?

434
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:02,881
-Shut up.
-You can tell me.

435
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:07,282
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I got a whopper myself.

436
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:28,268
What are you doing?

437
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:29,906
Motherfucker!

438
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,914
-What are you doing out here?
-Getting shit that's mine.

439
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,713
What are you doing?
What, I don't get to ask a question?

440
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:41,289
I'm taking photos. There's been two
murders. Before all the evidence--

441
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:45,588
That's not an answer. You're a limo
driver. What are you doing?

442
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:49,698
Looking to win some "beyond the call
of duty," limo-driver merit badge?

443
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,165
You're not on the job anymore.
You don't need to be a hero.

444
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:55,702
There's a real, live,
active-duty cop outside--

445
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:58,670
The one who's managed to lose
a convicted killer?

446
00:48:01,244 --> 00:48:03,007
You're a complicated cat, Edward.

447
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,547
No. Not really.

448
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,214
I think so.

449
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,889
What month were you born?

450
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:17,325
-May.
-Taurus.

451
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,192
Same as me.

452
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,163
-Where were you a cop?
-Los Angeles.

453
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,867
Were you fired or did you quit?

454
00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:33,538
I took medical leave.

455
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,841
It was making me sick.

456
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:41,279
I burned out, I guess.
Wasn't up for it.

457
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,617
One day I got a call...

458
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,325
...for a jumper.

459
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,464
A young Mexican girl.

460
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,458
Pregnant, infected with AIDS,
totally strung-out.

461
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:04,632
She was truly one of the doomed.

462
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:11,579
I asked her to come in off
the ledge and into my arms.

463
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:15,174
She asked me why
she should bother living.

464
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,889
What did you say?

465
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,760
I was trained
to tell her lots of things.

466
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,231
Her dreams, all the people
who'd miss her.

467
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,004
But for a second, I hesitated.

468
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,199
And she saw it.

469
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:47,907
Within that second, I couldn't think of
one optimistic thing to say to her.

470
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:54,885
So she spread her arms
and jumped.

471
00:50:00,096 --> 00:50:02,394
I started getting headaches...

472
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,864
...and eventually started blacking out.

473
00:50:09,105 --> 00:50:13,474
So I filed for medical.

474
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,453
What?

475
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:35,526
What is it?

476
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:41,666
Rhodes!

477
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:46,935
-It's worse. Nothing but static!
-Where's that key from the actress?

478
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:50,709
This was on the kid.

479
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,146
-What is it, some kind of countdown?
-Larry!

480
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:01,282
What the fuck is he doing?
Larry, come over here!

481
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:05,725
Come over here, man.
What are you doing? Come over here.

482
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,224
-What are you doing?
-I just went to get something.

483
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:14,864
We told you to watch the guy.
What are you doing in your office?

484
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,139
I just went to get something.

485
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:21,038
How many sets of keys are there
to this place? Look at me. How many?

486
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,645
-Two and a master set.
-Oh, my fucking God!

487
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:30,886
Larry, you mother--! You son of a--!
Get the fuck in here! Get in here!

488
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:35,516
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill my con?

489
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:40,595
Holy shit! Who did that?
Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!

490
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,356
Bullshit! You're lying!

491
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:46,434
-It's your bat sticking out of his throat!
-I know, but I didn't do it!

492
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,332
Check the doors!

493
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,132
-I didn't do it!
-Look at him!

494
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:53,537
-Why'd you kill him?
-Why were you outside?

495
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,735
-Why'd you leave him?
-I was scared.

496
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,142
-What were you scared of?
-You wouldn't understand.

497
00:51:58,314 --> 00:51:59,781
Try me.

498
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:01,712
-Why'd you kill my con?
-I didn't!

499
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,787
I don't know how--
I went to my office, that's all!

500
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:08,617
-Why'd you leave him?
-This your key? Number 8?

501
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,420
Ten, nine, eight, huh?
This is your key!

502
00:52:11,594 --> 00:52:13,562
You can't say that!
Those aren't my keys!

503
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,699
That's like leading the witness
or something. Look.

504
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:20,563
These are my keys, okay?
These are my keys. You see?

505
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,471
You got a Gucci wallet?
It's the actress's.

506
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:29,044
Yes, I took her wallet.
Afterwards. After she died!

507
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:34,616
Afterwards, all right? I didn't kill her.
And I didn't kill him.

508
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:39,551
-Let her go, Larry.
-Get back! You won't pin this on me.

509
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,748
-Timothy?
-Get him out of here!

510
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:45,292
-Put it down.
-I didn't hurt anybody. No one!

511
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,829
But I don't like cheap fucking whores!
If you take one more step--

512
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,330
Fuck!

513
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,477
Get it off!

514
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,441
Shit!

515
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,888
Come on, you little bitch.
Please fucking start.

516
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:20,191
-Goddamn it!
-Hey!

517
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,395
Larry, stop!

518
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,001
What is going on?

519
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,870
-Larry!
-Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!

520
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,872
Timothy! Timothy!

521
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,768
An insanity plea was
refused by the court...

522
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:06,432
...despite the fact that my client
is a certifiable Axis IV dissociative.

523
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:11,274
To this day, he remains unaware of
the crimes for which he was convicted.

524
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:17,250
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled
decisively that states cannot execute...

525
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,652
...a person who does not understand
why he's being put to death.

526
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,121
He signed a confession.

527
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,819
-He didn't just sign it, he dictated it.
-Thirdly...

528
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:31,491
...Malcolm's diaries found
misfiled in state evidence.

529
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:36,628
this notebook contains
entries made just before the murders.

530
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:41,140
Important to note are the spectacular
changes in handwriting style...

531
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,074
...tone, point of view.

532
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:48,081
What you are looking at are the private
thoughts of several different people.

533
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:52,017
With permission,
Dr. Mallick will elaborate.

534
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,656
Thank you.

535
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,689
Your Honor, there is no
universally efficacious treatment...

536
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,695
...for Dissociative Identity Disorder.

537
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:06,131
In theory, one attempts to move
the patient towards integration.

538
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,899
-A folding of their fractured psyche.
-Your Honor?

539
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,774
He's here.

540
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,856
No! What you saw was an accident!

541
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,190
He ran out in front of me!
I'm not a murderer!

542
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,424
There's a dead body
in your freezer, Larry.

543
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:40,126
-I didn't kill him. I found him like that.
-Stop it!

544
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:43,795
Listen! Listen! I was in Vegas last
month and I lost everything, okay?

545
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,202
Everything!

546
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:49,004
I drove west. I didn't know where
to go, but I was running on empty...

547
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,613
...so I pulled in here at this place.

548
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:56,115
And there was no one at the station,
so I came over to the office...

549
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,083
...and I walked in.

550
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,121
And there, sitting at that desk
right there, was the manager...

551
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,953
...facedown in a Banquet Potpie.
Dead!

552
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,426
-Heart attack or something.
-Banquet Potpie!

553
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,157
He'd been sitting there
for God knows how long.

554
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:14,360
All of a sudden, this auto-parts
salesman pulls up, looking for a room.

555
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,801
I didn't have a fucking dime...

556
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,567
...so I took his 30 and gave him one.

557
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:24,043
I just took the key from the wall
and gave him a room.

558
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,514
Maybe that was wrong,
but I was broke, and that's what I did.

559
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,577
Then I came back in here...

560
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:35,750
...and I moved Larry's body--
His name was Larry too.

561
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:39,554
I put him in the freezer.

562
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,895
I wasn't trying to hide him.
It was hot out.

563
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:49,664
I thought it was the best place for him
till his family or someone came along.

564
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,364
Only no one did...

565
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,572
...except more guests.

566
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,646
So I checked them in too.

567
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,040
And they all seemed happy...

568
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,880
...so I just stayed.

569
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,085
Cry me a river.
This is a total crock of shit!

570
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,693
-No, it's not!
-Admit it, you killed him!

571
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,625
Just like you killed my con.
Just like you killed her husband.

572
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,426
Just like you killed his actress.
Just admit it.

573
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,297
-Say it, "I killed them."
-Stop it! He can't take any more!

574
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:25,032
Everything is okay now. Everything
is fine. We got the guy. It's fine.

575
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,937
-I don't know what we got.
-What?

576
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,578
We thought we got the guy
two hours ago, then--

577
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:32,112
You believe this shit?
It's him! It's this guy!

578
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,409
He had a knife to your neck,
remember?

579
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:38,748
His story's so unbelievable,
I think it just might be true.

580
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,955
She's got a point.

581
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,154
You guys are crazy.

582
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,592
Maybe it's the burial ground.

583
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,661
What?

584
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:57,500
Read the brochure in there.
It's all around us.

585
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,768
A hundred years ago, the government
moved these Indians here.

586
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:04,175
They all died
because there was no water.

587
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,649
Now they're coming back to life
like sea monkeys, huh?

588
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,786
Come on.
Give me a break, sweetheart.

589
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,286
-Just take it easy, Rhodes.
-You know, you take it easy!

590
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:17,153
You've tried to run this show all night.
Giving orders, pointing fingers!

591
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,319
You blamed my con for everything,
and he ends up dead.

592
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,523
I'm telling you, it's him!
We all saw him run down George.

593
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,158
Your actress's wallet is right there.
She's dead, there's the wallet.

594
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,204
-What more do you want?
-Stop it! Please shut up!

595
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,402
All right. You want a plan?
Here's the plan, okay?

596
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:38,809
No one's gonna move. We'll stay
here, like this, in this room until dawn.

597
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,143
No one leaves, no one moves.

598
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:44,286
And if he tries anything,
I'm gonna shoot him!

599
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,651
And if something out there
comes in here, I'll shoot it!

600
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,725
And if anyone of us tries anything,
I'll shoot them!

601
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,361
-We get it.
-Good!

602
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:28,664
Timmy? Timmy?

603
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:32,029
-You need to stay in here with us.
-It's all right.

604
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:42,040
Remember that movie where
the 10 strangers went to an island...

605
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:44,612
...and then they all died
one by one...

606
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:49,150
...and then it turned out they weren't
strangers, they all had a connection?

607
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,549
They all messed with the wrong guy,
and he was getting revenge.

608
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,120
Shut up!

609
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:57,918
I'm just saying maybe there's
a connection between all of us.

610
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,692
Like what?

611
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,289
-We're all in Nevada.
-Shut up!

612
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,166
Where were you going with your con
when you pulled in here?

613
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,376
Carson City. Okay?

614
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:19,940
I was going home to Florida.
Where were you going?

615
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,981
I was taking the actress to L.A.

616
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,876
I was born in Florida.

617
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,718
Since you been in that chair,
no one's died, so shut up!

618
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:29,324
No one's died since we've
all been here!

619
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:32,484
-Hey, sweetie, sit down.
-Where in Florida, Larry?

620
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,065
-Where in Florida?
-Friends now, huh? Great.

621
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:42,668
-Polk County.
-That's where I was born.

622
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:45,171
-Which town?
-Mulberry.

623
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:48,606
-Frostproof.
-No wonder you left.

624
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,038
There's a town called Frostproof?

625
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:55,350
They grow oranges.
The name doubles as a slogan.

626
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:59,284
I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk.
Why would you wanna go back?

627
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,424
I found a grove for sale
on the Internet.

628
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:05,925
Nine acres, 1200 trees.
Limes and oranges.

629
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:10,257
According to the realtor, the soil
needs a few tills, phosphorous...

630
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:16,838
...lanes need reading,
but it's real good land.

631
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,708
What?

632
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,371
It sounds nice.

633
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,163
Ed?

634
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,903
She's dead.

635
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,930
Get him out of here.

636
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,734
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

637
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,908
Look at this.

638
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:36,785
-Where'd you get that?
-Right here.

639
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:45,290
This doesn't make any sense.
She died from an accident.

640
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:49,921
George was an accident,
if you believe Larry.

641
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,302
Where is seven?

642
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,998
Back it up!

643
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:40,911
-See, I told you it wasn't me!
-That's not possible.

644
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:45,180
I was standing right there. I saw what
happened. We all saw what happened.

645
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:48,881
He ran out. Nobody could have
known he was gonna do that.

646
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:50,355
No one human.

647
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,994
We're back to that again?
It's the spirits, huh?

648
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:57,223
Maybe it's the ghost of the guy
that Larry put in the freezer.

649
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,102
Somebody untie me.
Goddamn it!

650
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,965
You know it wasn't me.
Come on.

651
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:03,272
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

652
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:05,069
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

653
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,471
Take her car and get out.
You, her and the kid.

654
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:08,871
There's nowhere to go.

655
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,070
-How much gas do you have?
-Half a tank.

656
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,340
You can drive till dawn on that.
Look at me.

657
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,178
When you get to where it's flooded,
go the other way.

658
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,717
I don't know if I can.

659
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:21,015
Get the kid and go.
Right now. Come on.

660
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,179
Timmy.

661
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,986
Timmy, come on. Let's go.
Get up.

662
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,321
What's going on?

663
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,225
-They can't leave!
-This way.

664
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,365
We'll see you
when the storm breaks.

665
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,866
Hey! Hey! They can't leave!
Where are they going? Get back here!

666
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,628
Go, go, go!
They're leaving.

667
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,170
-They're not leaving.
-Go!

668
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,070
You can't let suspects leave
after four people have been killed!

669
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:43,178
-You really think they're suspects?
-They're not leaving!

670
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,443
Shit.

671
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,819
Ginny!

672
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:58,555
Extinguishers.
Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?

673
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:01,394
-Fire extinguisher! Where?
-Back there!

674
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:26,454
Nobody in there.

675
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,819
Maybe it got so hot,
they got cremated.

676
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,056
There'd be something left.

677
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,702
You did this.

678
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:46,502
You did this!
You told them to get into the car!

679
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,143
Are you happy?

680
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,429
Where is he?

681
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,058
Nothing.

682
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,536
I give up!

683
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,236
I give up!
What the hell do you want?

684
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:32,745
What do you want, you sick bastard?
What the fuck do you want from us?

685
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:38,116
I am turning 30 next week
and I just want to go home...

686
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,016
...and grow oranges!

687
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,626
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.

688
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,700
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.

689
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,567
Me too.

690
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,175
Me too.

691
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,742
Yeah.

692
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,575
George York, May 10.

693
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,687
Alice York, May 10.

694
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,686
Caroline Suzanne, May 10

695
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:18,285
Ginny and Lou Isiana, May 10.

696
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,861
Me, Larry Washington,
May fucking 10.

697
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,729
What are the odds?
Must be 10 trillion-to-one.

698
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:28,597
What is it?

699
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,480
-Where's the fuse box, Larry?
-Other side of the building.

700
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,654
Ginny and Lou Isiana.

701
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:59,063
Virginia and Louisiana.

702
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,430
Caroline, Carolina.

703
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,296
Paris Nevada

704
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,101
George York.

705
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,511
Larry Washington.

706
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:15,650
Rhodes, Rhode Island.

707
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,783
Ed Dakota.

708
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:42,367
When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there

709
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,911
He wasn't there again today

710
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,945
I wish
I wish he'd go away

711
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,776
Who is this?

712
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,922
Who am I speaking to right now?

713
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,889
Where did you learn that poem?

714
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,461
Who am I speaking to?
Look at me.

715
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,894
Who am I speaking to right now?

716
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:11,734
Doc?

717
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,208
-Edward?
-What's happening?

718
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,208
-Please be quiet.
-He can hear what we're saying?

719
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:22,916
Of course I can hear
what you're fucking saying.

720
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:28,148
Edward, you missed your last
appointment. Where have you been?

721
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:33,625
-Did I black out again?
-Try and think back.

722
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:36,264
Where have you been?

723
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:39,094
All right.
I was driving this actress...

724
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:44,733
...and we got stuck at the motel.
There was a storm.

725
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:48,336
We couldn't get out
because of the storm.

726
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:50,672
What happened at the motel?

727
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:56,246
People started dying.

728
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,444
And then their bodies--
It didn't make any sense.

729
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,351
They disappeared.

730
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:06,555
Edward, I'd like to show
something to you, if I may.

731
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,301
Do you recognize this man?

732
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,638
No.

733
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,107
That man, Edward,
is Malcolm Rivers.

734
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,872
He's had a very troubled life.
He was arrested four years ago...

735
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:28,414
...and convicted of the murder
of six people in a violent rampage.

736
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:31,114
-He did this.
-Detective, please.

737
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,914
Edward, listen to me.

738
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:39,227
When faced with an intense trauma,
a child's mind may fracture...

739
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:42,956
...creating disassociated identities.

740
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:47,202
That's exactly what happened
to Malcolm Rivers.

741
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:49,769
He developed a condition
that is commonly known...

742
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:52,840
...as Multiple Personality Syndrome.

743
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,014
Why are you telling me this?

744
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,547
Because you, Edward...

745
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,847
...are one of his personalities.

746
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,954
What?

747
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:30,808
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
did you do to my face?

748
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,675
-Keep calm.
-Where is my face?

749
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,339
-That is your face.
-Why am I tied up?

750
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,109
-Keep calm.
-Where is--?

751
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,810
-Please.
-Jesus Christ!

752
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:41,149
-Where is my face?
-Stay calm.

753
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:45,020
No! I'm not gonna stay calm!
Why am I tied up like this?

754
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,652
Who are all these people?
What happened at the motel?

755
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,857
-Where is everybody?
-They don't exist, Edward.

756
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:56,628
You were all created
by Malcolm as a child.

757
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:57,203
-You're a liar!
-Consider what you know.

758
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,739
-Everyone named after a state.
-No.

759
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:03,366
Everyone sharing the same birthday.
Your blackouts.

760
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,012
No! I was a cop!

761
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,911
I was a cop in the Rampart Division
of L.A.P.D. for six years.

762
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:10,108
Edward, please.

763
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:12,685
I live in Hollywood,
in a studio apartment.

764
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:15,221
-You don't live there.
-I do live there!

765
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,254
You don't live anywhere.

766
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:21,654
I know this is difficult to accept,
but the face you saw in that mirror...

767
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:27,132
...is the face I've always seen when
I talk to Edward or Paris or Larry...

768
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,236
...or anyone else you've met tonight.

769
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,341
Malcolm is in the midst
of a medical treatment.

770
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:39,072
One which forces all his identities to
confront one another for the first time.

771
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,773
I knew there would be violence...

772
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:47,183
...and with it, the number
of the identities would be reduced.

773
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,425
Reduced?

774
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,391
One of the personalities
you've met tonight, Edward...

775
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:57,464
...committed those murders
four years ago.

776
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:01,599
He took control of Malcolm's body,
as you have now...

777
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:06,969
...and released an unspeakable rage.
And in 19 hours...

778
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:10,703
...Malcolm Rivers will be put to death
because of those actions...

779
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:14,747
...unless I can convince that man...

780
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,317
...that the killer is gone.

781
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:23,023
I need you to stay with me.
Edward?

782
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:26,491
I need your help.
I need your help to finish this.

783
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:28,825
Edward, listen to me.

784
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,760
Edward, stay with me.

785
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:34,801
Listen to me.
I need you to understand.

786
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:38,133
The killer cannot survive.

787
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,569
Edward!

788
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,293
Got it?

789
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:12,932
I can't see a thing.
Is there a flashlight?

790
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:14,735
Hang on. Hang on.

791
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:18,975
-You got a flashlight?
-Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Goddamn it.

792
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,226
Shut up!

793
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,131
Hey. What am I
supposed to wear, man?

794
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,100
You're in it.

795
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:28,972
Larry.

796
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,152
Larry, come here.

797
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,153
Ed!

798
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:51,505
Ed!

799
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:07,722
Larry!

800
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:15,629
-Larry!
-Paris.

801
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,758
Paris.

802
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,433
Larry?

803
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:28,475
Larry? Larry?

804
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,310
Where are the keys to the truck?

805
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,610
Where are the keys to the truck?

806
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:43,919
-That was good, Larry.
-We gotta get out of here.

807
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:47,118
-Ed has the keys to the truck.
-I got a spare right here.

808
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:50,265
-Where is he?
-I don't know. Here.

809
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:54,201
-What are you doing?
-We need a gun.

810
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:56,396
Holy shit!

811
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:01,842
Give me the keys to the truck.

812
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,565
Ed!

813
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,639
We gotta get out of here!

814
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:08,105
-Paris--
-He's coming. He's--

815
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:10,608
-Stay here.
-What's wrong with you?

816
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,509
Paris, listen to me.

817
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,082
Stay here.

818
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,480
It's gonna be okay.

819
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:47,671
Throw me the keys to the truck, Ed.

820
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:53,380
Throw me the keys to the truck.
Stay there. Stay there!

821
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:29,752
Ed! Ed! Ed!

822
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,464
Ed, let me see.

823
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,361
We gotta get you to a hospital.

824
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,627
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

825
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:44,704
Stay with me because
I'm gonna get you to the truck.

826
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:48,502
Put your arm around my neck.
You gotta hold on, okay?

827
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:54,343
You with me, Ed? Stay with me.
Okay. One, two, three.

828
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:59,751
You gotta help me get you up.
Ed, you gotta push a little bit.

829
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:05,057
Ed, why won't you let me help you?

830
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,188
Where did you go before?

831
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:12,163
What did you see?
Tell me what you saw.

832
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,731
I saw you.

833
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:25,044
I saw you in an orange grove.

834
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,777
Why won't you let me help you?

835
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,280
Where did you go?

836
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:03,508
What did you see?

837
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,153
I saw you...

838
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:14,225
...in an orange grove.

839
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:55,700
The question, Your Honor, is whether
to convict the body or the mind.

840
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:59,899
His body committed these murders,
that is true.

841
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:02,339
The person who remains
inside did not.

842
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,068
Judge Taylor, that may not be true--

843
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:06,737
We witnessed the destruction
of 10 identities tonight.

844
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,678
Nine were innocent
and one was guilty.

845
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:09,839
They're not real!

846
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:12,316
The violence that existed in him
has been executed.

847
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:17,151
Your Honor, Malcolm belongs
in a state hospital.

848
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:26,330
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, it is
the recommendation of this court...

849
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:29,163
...that Mr. Rivers' execution
be stayed.

850
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:33,171
I am transferring Mr. Rivers
to state psychiatric services...

851
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:36,510
...under the care of Dr. Mallick.

852
01:23:53,193 --> 01:23:57,129
Cracked heels and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn

853
01:23:57,297 --> 01:24:01,597
But it's not that way
I wasn't born to lose you

854
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:04,066
I want you

855
01:24:04,237 --> 01:24:06,432
I want you

856
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:10,838
I want you so bad

857
01:25:23,696 --> 01:25:24,685
Timmy.

858
01:25:53,794 --> 01:25:55,659
Timmy.

859
01:25:56,564 --> 01:25:57,553
No, please don't.

860
01:25:58,732 --> 01:25:59,721
No, Timmy, please.

861
01:26:00,134 --> 01:26:02,125
What is it, Malcolm?

862
01:26:11,412 --> 01:26:12,401
Malcolm?

863
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:13,769
Whores don't

864
01:26:13,948 --> 01:26:15,279
get a second chance.

865
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:39,103
When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there

866
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,803
He wasn't there again today

867
01:26:42,977 --> 01:26:46,037
I wish
I wish he'd go away
