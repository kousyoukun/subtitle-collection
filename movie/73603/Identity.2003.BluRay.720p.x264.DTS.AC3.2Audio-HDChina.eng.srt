1
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,051
As I was going up the stair

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,022
I met a man who wasn't there

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,422
I met a man who wasn't there

4
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,087
He wasn't there again today

5
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,430
I wish
I wish he'd go away

6
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,564
Where did you learn that?

7
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,105
Where did you learn that poem?

8
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,641
I made it up.

9
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,247
When I was a kid, I made it up.

10
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,049
What else do you remember
from back then?

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,652
Don't beat around the bush, doc.
Don't beat around the bush.

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,858
Don't beat around the bush.
Don't beat around the bush, doc!

13
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:14,473
Tell me what you remember
about your mother.

14
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,299
I remember my mom.

15
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,643
I remember my mom.

16
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,840
I remember my mom was a whore.

17
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,797
How long would she keep you there?

18
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,029
As long as she was busy.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,181
Do you understand
why you're talking with me now?

20
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,014
You're supposed to be good with...

21
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,345
...headaches.

22
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,093
I need something more than aspirin.
Know what I mean?

23
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,289
Do you remember the murders?

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,228
I remember...

25
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,566
...that Columbia is the capital
of South Carolina.

26
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,704
I remember that--

27
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,321
Are you the person
who murdered six residents...

28
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,984
...of the Lakeworth Apartments
on May 10, 1998?

29
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,998
That's my birthday.

30
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,500
Who am I speaking to right now?

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,709
What should I call you?

32
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,214
Call me whatever you want.

33
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,560
Gary?

34
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,461
Gary?

35
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,060
Gary, you awake?

36
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,729
Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact,
I am awake.

37
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,704
I'm sorry to bother you at home...

38
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,141
...but there's gonna be a midnight
hearing in the Rivers case.

39
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:37,215
The defense found a notebook
misfiled in evidence, a diary.

40
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,284
They argued to the state Supremes
that it was suppressed.

41
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,916
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,388
There's no media.
This all happened under the radar.

43
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,993
The prisoner transport
left an hour ago from Ely.

44
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,325
Left Ely? What do you mean?
What transport?

45
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,331
The diary gave them an opening
to argue insanity again.

46
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,937
They need Rivers present, so they
drugged him, put him on a transport.

47
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,266
They're taking this scumbag
to a hearing...

48
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,272
...the night before his execution.

49
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,673
How the fuck did you let that happen?

50
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,682
Would anyone like to play
another round?

51
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,750
Let's get another puzzle,
Vanna. What do we have?

52
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,357
-"Around the House" is the category.
-Buy a vowel.

53
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,356
-Buy a vowel.
-Pick up that trip.

54
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,656
-Buy a vowel, you idiot.
-I'd like to buy a vowel. An E.

55
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,224
One E.

56
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,802
-All right, 350 left.
-N.

57
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,400
-Buy a vowel.
-Buy another vowel.

58
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,474
-Yes!
-An I.

59
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,938
-I'd like to solve.
-Sure.

60
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,584
"Kibbles 'n Bits. "

61
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,618
She won't stop bleeding.
She won't stop bleeding.

62
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,126
-Jesus. What happened?
-An accident. We had an accident.

63
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,458
Rain and lightning
is moving into Elko.

64
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,068
Doppler Radar has picked up a
severe thunderstorm with lightning...

65
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,636
...on its way from Pershing
and Lander counties.

66
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,569
-We could get damaging winds....
-Four times 10 equals--

67
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,003
Four times 10--

68
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,340
Timothy, could you not do that now?
We're trying to hear about the storm.

69
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,146
-Sure you don't want me to drive?
-No.

70
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:23,051
I'll get us to Anderson,
then you can take over after we eat.

71
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,890
Turn into spin.

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,398
Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.

73
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:37,161
Check mirror and gauge indicator
and roll...

74
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,034
...to a slow, smooth stop.

75
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,300
You okay, honey? Timothy?

76
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,043
Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,850
-It's a shoe.
-What?

78
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,322
It's a shoe!

79
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,371
For he's a jolly good fellow

80
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:26,177
For he's a jolly good fellow

81
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:32,814
For he's a jolly good fellow

82
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:41,356
Which nobody can deny

83
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,975
Shit!

84
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:04,756
-Why didn't we get a better spare?
-Do you know what radials cost, Alice?

85
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,482
Honey, don't get defensive.

86
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,253
Well, if the point is to put him,
Timothy, into the right school...

87
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,762
-...it's absurd to focus...
-George? George?

88
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,457
-...on replacement tires.
-What can I do to help?

89
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,401
Nothing. I'm fine, but...

90
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,931
...thank you.

91
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,661
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Alice?

92
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,302
Oh, my God! Alice?
What have you done?

93
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,010
What have you done?
What have you done?

94
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,951
Hi, Harry.
Where do I begin?

95
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,148
I have walked off the set, okay?

96
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,487
I know they'll say
that I am in breach...

97
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,596
...but they clearly
did not read my deal.

98
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,062
They had me at a Ramada--

99
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,929
Oh, Jesus.

100
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
I think I have a spare battery
in my bag.

101
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,404
Excuse me?

102
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,638
I have a spare battery in my bag
up front, next to you.

103
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:41,276
-Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?
-The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.

104
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,423
I don't see anything--

105
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,757
Just use your fucking eyes!
It's in the side pocket! Just look!

106
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,193
Jesus!

107
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,173
What have you done?
What have you done?

108
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,711
No, fool! If you help him,
you assume responsibility.

109
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,415
It is my responsibility.
Let go of me.

110
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,218
Alice? Alice?

111
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,582
What have you done?
What have you done?

112
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,516
Let me take a look.

113
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,992
The driver of every motor vehicle
involved in any manner of accident...

114
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,963
...originating from the operation
of a vehicle shall, within 10 days....

115
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,466
You got a towel or something
in the car?

116
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,332
Okay. Come help me look.

117
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,466
--within 10 days of the accident...

118
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,976
...if you are operating a vehicle
and it should, at any time, involve--

119
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:45,413
-Stay here. Keep her dry.
-It's okay. It's okay, honey.

120
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,818
-Open the door! We need the phone.
-No!

121
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,620
Sweetheart, it's okay.

122
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,520
Honey, it's okay.

123
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,722
-Give me the goddamn phone!
-The phone is dead, all right?

124
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,336
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay.

125
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,904
No!

126
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,867
-She won't stop bleeding.
-Jesus. What happened?

127
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,834
There was an accident.
May I please use your phone?

128
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,066
-Please use your phone?
-Yeah, sure.

129
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,644
Shit. I'm not getting a line.
It happens in the rain.

130
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,009
The phone doesn't work.

131
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,175
St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency,
30 miles east.

132
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,347
Okay.

133
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,551
You sit here, okay?

134
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,887
Keep pressure on the wound.
I'll be back with an ambulance.

135
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,833
What are you doing?

136
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,274
Sorry. It's a step down
from the Ramada, but it'll have to do.

137
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,437
I am not staying here.
Are you out of your mind?

138
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:27,416
This is my car. You work for me.
Get those bags back in this car now!

139
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:34,016
I understand the bleeding person
has a medical condition, but so do I.

140
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:39,688
My lung walls have depleted cilia.
If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!

141
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,632
No, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

142
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,205
Please!

143
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,914
Hey!

144
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,185
Stop. Please, please.

145
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,257
Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck.
Can I get a ride?

146
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,229
Okay.

147
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,344
You know you're going east.

148
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,486
Hospital's this way.

149
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,924
It's flooded.
I mean, it's a dead end.

150
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,699
Yeah, well, if you don't mind,
I gotta try.

151
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,797
Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.

152
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,842
Didn't you use to be that actress?

153
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,520
Yes.

154
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,459
-Wow.
-Now, is that a nice room?

155
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:20,997
Because though I am leaving soon,
I still would prefer a nice room.

156
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,193
Your nicest...

157
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,338
...if that is possible.

158
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,307
Eight's very cozy.

159
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,848
I tried to tell you.

160
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,893
Hey! Hey, stop!
There's no way through.

161
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,762
There's no way through!
No way through!

162
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,369
-Lou, wake up.
-What?

163
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,562
Cell phone.

164
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,764
-What?
-Do you have a cell phone?

165
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,341
Who wants to know?

166
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,706
There's been an accident,
a bad one. A lady's hurt.

167
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,781
-We need a cell phone right now.
-Dude, slow down.

168
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,408
First, we don't know who you are.
Second, we don't see an accident--

169
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,284
Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really
fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.

170
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,925
So if you have a cell phone,
give it to me now!

171
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:26,531
Dude, we don't have a cell phone,
so could you just let go of me now?!

172
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,864
I need you to give me a lift
in the other direction.

173
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,631
It's flooded that way too.
It's worse than this.

174
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,440
Ginny, pop the trunk.
Let them in.

175
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,703
Let them in.

176
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,831
Hey. How you doing?

177
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,303
-Phone still dead?
-Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?

178
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:14,071
Stuck in a run-off two miles down
the road. The other way's fucked too.

179
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,237
The kids gave us a lift.
The girl was stranded.

180
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,217
-Is there another way out?
-Is she a hooker?

181
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,012
Hey! Is there a back road?

182
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,711
Where do you think the water's going?
You wouldn't get 500 feet.

183
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,518
-How's the woman?
-I don't know. They're in number 4.

184
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,776
I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms
by the hour.

185
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,945
Funny. You still serving food?

186
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,177
Vending machines are around
the corner. Go ahead.

187
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,791
Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with
picture ID. You need one room or two?

188
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,554
Excuse me. I was talking to you.
I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.

189
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,821
Well, I don't like looking at trash.

190
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,701
We're a little stuck here, George.
I don't think we can get out tonight.

191
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:23,610
-She just keeps shaking.
-She's in shock.

192
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,182
-Let me take a look.
-What?

193
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,912
Let me take a look.

194
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,838
Did your wife pack a sewing kit?

195
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,802
No.

196
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:56,445
Ginny, wait up.

197
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:02,078
Six.

198
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:05,349
At least we got a good number.

199
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:54,997
-Did you feel that?
-Feel what?

200
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:56,833
Cold.

201
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:12,317
Are you the manager?

202
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:14,479
Yeah.

203
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:19,758
I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections.
I'm transporting a prisoner here.

204
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,830
The law gives you the right
to refuse us service...

205
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:25,433
...but the roads are flooded.
I could use a room.

206
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:29,037
-It's an emergency.
-You got a radio in that car?

207
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:31,332
-Who's this?
-Limo driver, had an accident.

208
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:34,670
I got a lady pretty banged up.
I could use an ambulance.

209
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:37,711
Four-four-two requesting medical.

210
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,576
Four-four-two requesting medical.

211
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,480
Nothing. It's been like this
for the past hour.

212
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,087
She's losing a lot of blood.
Got a first aid kit?

213
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:47,620
Band-Aids, that's it.

214
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,384
-How about a needle and thread?
-Maybe in the diner.

215
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,088
I'll get it. Locked up.
Stay dry.

216
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:57,891
I'll be back with your key.
I'll put you in 10.

217
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:01,332
-Okay, thanks.
-What do you got back there?

218
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:03,631
Prison transfer.

219
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:07,139
Maybe when you get him situated,
come to 4 and look at the lady.

220
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,541
-I could use a second opinion.
-Yeah, sure.

221
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:21,252
Looks like you're fucked.

222
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:23,386
Shut up!

223
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,036
-I wish I had beige.
-This is fine.

224
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,575
Would have been better.

225
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:45,543
I gotta get the officer situated.
Let me know if you need something.

226
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:47,706
I'll be right back.

227
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:56,720
Where did you learn to do that?

228
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:59,923
Pretty much where you're standing.

229
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:15,642
Hey, is the...?

230
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,314
The little boy, is he all right?

231
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:21,916
He hasn't said a word
since the accident.

232
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:26,646
No, no, no. He doesn't talk much
ever since the....

233
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:31,525
I'm his stepfather.

234
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:33,821
His father....

235
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:37,622
Two years ago, he left.

236
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:41,634
Little temper problem.

237
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,645
Watch your step.

238
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:08,161
The furniture's for shit.

239
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:12,665
If you're fixing to cuff him to
something, the toilet's bolted down.

240
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:14,735
Thank you so much
for your assistance.

241
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:17,668
-It's a good idea. Come on.
-I got stripes

242
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,243
Stripes around my shoulders
And these chains

243
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,709
These chains
They're about to--

244
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,581
Let's go look at that lady.

245
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,324
-You get anyone?
-What?

246
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,025
-Did you get through?
-No, not yet.

247
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:48,964
Good stitch job.

248
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:54,738
Pulse is shallow, but steady.
Keep her comfortable.

249
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,401
We should take turns on the radio,
if that's all right.

250
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:00,744
No, it's not. I can manage.

251
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,926
You gonna arrest me, officer?

252
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,440
What?

253
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:29,878
How'd you do that?
How'd you know I was a cop?

254
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:35,748
No shit.

255
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:40,981
Cheetos for dinner, huh?

256
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:44,718
-That don't seem right.
-You got a better idea?

257
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:49,126
I worked mess in the service.
Maybe the diner's open. I could--

258
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:52,290
You got change for a dollar?

259
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:55,827
I don't know. Let me see.

260
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:07,572
Here you go.

261
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:10,948
You got a name?

262
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:15,086
-Paris.
-Paris, huh?

263
00:23:15,257 --> 00:23:16,554
I'll get it.

264
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,921
Never been.

265
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:22,258
Well, you ain't going tonight.

266
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:34,642
Please.

267
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,540
Please be strong.

268
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,980
You see, Timothy and I...

269
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:44,517
...we need you.

270
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:47,783
We need you so much.

271
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:48,445
Lou?

272
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:53,011
Lou?

273
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:27,150
You need to tell them, Harry,
that I can't work, I can't perform...

274
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:30,190
...I can't shine living
in an environment like that.

275
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,796
No, it is not about the money.
It's about the working conditions.

276
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:08,362
One bar.

277
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:10,898
One bar.

278
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,260
No bar.

279
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:14,793
One bar.

280
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,130
Two bars.

281
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,406
Come on. Come on.

282
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,806
Here we go.

283
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,013
There you go. Come on.

284
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:34,447
Goddamn desert wasteland!

285
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:46,357
Oh, shit! I just had it.

286
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:30,887
Holy fuck.

287
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:04,287
-Jesus, Mother of God.
-Who is this?

288
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:07,724
The woman I was driving.

289
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:13,829
-What the hell are you doing?
-There's something in there.

290
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:16,095
-Use this, man.
-Thanks.

291
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:19,468
-Are you a cop?
-I was.

292
00:31:27,216 --> 00:31:30,515
-She was in Room 10?
-I am.

293
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:36,248
-Where's your guy?
-Cuffed to a toilet.

294
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:48,462
Son of a bitch.

295
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:52,171
That was a fucking drive.

296
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:59,347
-Gentlemen.
-Your Honor.

297
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:09,418
Ready, Sharon? Alrighty.

298
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:13,027
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada,
for the purposes of--

299
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:18,792
Judge Taylor, sir, with due respect,
we should wait till my client arrives.

300
00:32:19,268 --> 00:32:23,227
-He has a right to be present.
-He has precious few rights.

301
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:25,305
He's 24 hours from execution.

302
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:29,400
But to demonstrate his
mental state, which is the purpose--

303
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:31,643
His mental state?

304
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:33,977
His mental state?

305
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:38,509
Do you know what time it is?
You think I got time for bullshit?

306
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:42,282
That the justices called me in the
middle of the night to review a case...

307
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:46,894
...I already sat on, that I already
decided, may make you happy.

308
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:49,121
But it pisses me off.

309
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:53,266
When your boy gets here, do what you
want, but in the name of decency...

310
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,995
...state your goddamn case!

311
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,966
Yes, sir.

312
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:02,167
Somebody get me
a cup of coffee, black.

313
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:11,979
All right, everybody! Listen up!

314
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:14,581
There was an incident tonight.

315
00:33:14,756 --> 00:33:16,849
That's police talk for,
"Someone's head got lopped off."

316
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:18,424
Larry!

317
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:22,821
-Caroline Suzanne was murdered.
-What?

318
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:26,729
-Who's Caroline Suzanne?
-The actress I was driving.

319
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:30,133
And where exactly did that happen?

320
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:33,536
We don't know, because
we can't find the body.

321
00:33:33,742 --> 00:33:35,175
Not all of it anyway.

322
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:40,407
-What do you mean, you can't find it?
-Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

323
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:44,518
Officer Rhodes is outside.
He was transporting a convict.

324
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:47,246
-Who escaped.
-What are you--?

325
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,255
-Hold on.
-Running free!

326
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,859
Will you shut the fuck
up so he can talk?

327
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:55,997
This is my place, ho!
I'll say what I please!

328
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,791
-It's safe here.
-It is not safe here!

329
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,866
-There's a cop here.
-Yeah, two cops.

330
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:01,696
Wait. You're a cop?

331
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:07,432
-I was. Shut up, Larry!
-It's not safe here! I'm not staying--

332
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:10,537
It's all right. It's okay.

333
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:14,241
Nothing.

334
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:17,647
-Is she okay?
-Ginny.

335
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,083
Ginny, will you...?
Stop it. Don't do this right now.

336
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:25,824
-What are you doing?
-Put your arm around your girlfriend.

337
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:30,055
-Actually, she's my wife.
-Everybody just stay here.

338
00:34:30,232 --> 00:34:33,292
-Stay in this room.
-Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.

339
00:34:33,568 --> 00:34:35,092
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

340
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,797
-I'm not.
-All right. Larry?

341
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:40,407
-Come with us.
-Why?

342
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:43,576
-You know the place.
-Here's what I know. I'm not a cop.

343
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:46,339
I don't take orders from
a professional slut!

344
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:49,673
-Fuck you!
-Listen. Just stay here, please.

345
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,512
Keep everybody calm.

346
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:03,189
He's not gonna get too far.
Not in this!

347
00:35:04,966 --> 00:35:06,957
Rhodes!

348
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:08,827
What are we chasing here?

349
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:14,504
Multiple homicide.

350
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,346
I'll go around this way.
Meet you in back.

351
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:34,619
Is that where you live
full-time? Las Vegas?

352
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,029
-Used to.
-What's that supposed to mean?

353
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:43,999
It means I don't live there anymore.

354
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:21,937
Maine!

355
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:27,175
We'll go see if we can use this one.
We'll go in here.

356
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:30,876
Since that wasn't a successful
attempt, we'll go in here.

357
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:35,714
I'll be right out here. It's okay.
I'm gonna stand guard.

358
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:40,792
Not a worry. I'll be right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

359
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:51,901
See, his mother usually does this.

360
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:17,730
Hey, Ginny. So how long
you two been married?

361
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:21,801
About nine hours. It was
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

362
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:24,132
Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?

363
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,768
-We need to leave!
-I was just talking to her.

364
00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:30,571
Something's happening!
I need to get out of here!

365
00:37:30,745 --> 00:37:35,978
-Ginny! Ginny!
-You don't own me, Lou!

366
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,449
I own what's inside you!
Half, at least.

367
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,555
You don't own any part
of me or my baby!

368
00:37:41,723 --> 00:37:43,520
Then why did I marry you?

369
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:48,687
-Don't slam the goddamn door on me!
-Hey! Hey!

370
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:51,354
You guys, just calm down!

371
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:02,008
We are not leaving.
There is no place else to go.

372
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:06,204
There's a flood outside,
Ginny. Stop it! Stop it!

373
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:09,248
I'm not pregnant!

374
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:15,754
What did you just say?

375
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,892
I lied.

376
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:24,292
I'm not pregnant.

377
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:30,598
What are you talking about?
I saw the test.

378
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:37,302
Why would you do that to me?

379
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:42,515
Because Alison saw you at
The Hawk with that fucking girl!

380
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:50,851
-Ginny, what are we, like 15?
-Go away!

381
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,592
Goddamn!

382
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:16,947
-Open this goddamn door, Ginny!
-No!

383
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:19,951
I haven't been to The Hawk
in over a fucking year.

384
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:25,889
Alison is a stupid bitch-whore,
who likes fucking with your head.

385
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:28,359
Open the damn door, Ginny.

386
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:32,396
-Open the fucking door!
-Not until you calm down!

387
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:36,635
I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!

388
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:48,782
What are you doing?

389
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:54,617
Lou?

390
00:40:08,903 --> 00:40:13,135
Ginny, open this damn door!
Open the door!

391
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:16,439
-Open the door!
-Stop it, stop it!

392
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:22,073
Ginny, damn it, open the door!
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!

393
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,684
Lou, please stop!

394
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,990
Lou?

395
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:50,570
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

396
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:53,536
Help me! Somebody help me!

397
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,949
Help me!

398
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,777
Help me! Somebody help me!

399
00:42:08,189 --> 00:42:11,852
Is he in there? Is he in there?

400
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:17,022
Ginny, are you okay?
What happened? What happened?

401
00:42:23,738 --> 00:42:26,764
-Oh, shit.
-Jesus Christ.

402
00:42:35,149 --> 00:42:38,209
Lou? Lou?

403
00:42:39,354 --> 00:42:41,447
What's going on?

404
00:44:04,172 --> 00:44:05,537
What the hell?

405
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,575
Oh, shit!

406
00:44:12,814 --> 00:44:14,975
Come here!

407
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,498
They caught him. They caught him.

408
00:44:41,642 --> 00:44:44,042
Why are we keeping him in here?

409
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:48,009
-Where would you prefer, Larry?
-I don't know.

410
00:44:48,282 --> 00:44:50,910
I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?
Did I tell you that?

411
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:55,852
They got in a fight! I tried to
get them to go back inside!

412
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:58,788
Should we try the radio again?

413
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:02,893
Larry, just stay here and watch him.

414
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:06,591
-Go back and look after Ginny.
-Where are you going?

415
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:09,596
Just do it, please.

416
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:11,733
Ed?

417
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,138
I don't know if I'm comfortable
with guard duty, per se.

418
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:21,976
He's unconscious, Larry.
He's tied to a post.

419
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:47,440
Timothy.

420
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:52,403
Timothy.

421
00:45:58,853 --> 00:46:04,155
Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?

422
00:46:05,493 --> 00:46:07,859
I don't remember anything.

423
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:11,156
We had an accident.

424
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,625
George? Can you keep
an eye on Ginny for a minute?

425
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:21,136
She's awake now. I have
to get some aspirin to help her.

426
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:25,640
Darling, I gotta go get
something out of my room.

427
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:45,194
-Shit!
-What's wrong, buddy?

428
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:47,664
What do you got in the fridge?

429
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:51,265
-You shut up.
-What's in there?

430
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,336
What's in there?

431
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,479
-What do you got in there?
-Shut up.

432
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,711
What is it, huh?

433
00:47:00,882 --> 00:47:02,645
-Shut up.
-You can tell me.

434
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:07,046
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I got a whopper myself.

435
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,032
What are you doing?

436
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:29,670
Motherfucker!

437
00:47:29,844 --> 00:47:33,678
-What are you doing out here?
-Getting shit that's mine.

438
00:47:33,848 --> 00:47:37,477
What are you doing?
What, I don't get to ask a question?

439
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:41,053
I'm taking photos. There's been two
murders. Before all the evidence--

440
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:45,352
That's not an answer. You're a limo
driver. What are you doing?

441
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:49,462
Looking to win some "beyond the call
of duty," limo-driver merit badge?

442
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,929
You're not on the job anymore.
You don't need to be a hero.

443
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,466
There's a real, live,
active-duty cop outside--

444
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:58,434
The one who's managed to lose
a convicted killer?

445
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:02,771
You're a complicated cat, Edward.

446
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:06,311
No. Not really.

447
00:48:06,714 --> 00:48:08,978
I think so.

448
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:13,653
What month were you born?

449
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:17,089
-May.
-Taurus.

450
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:19,956
Same as me.

451
00:48:23,264 --> 00:48:26,927
-Where were you a cop?
-Los Angeles.

452
00:48:27,468 --> 00:48:30,631
Were you fired or did you quit?

453
00:48:31,038 --> 00:48:33,302
I took medical leave.

454
00:48:33,841 --> 00:48:36,605
It was making me sick.

455
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:41,043
I burned out, I guess.
Wasn't up for it.

456
00:48:45,186 --> 00:48:47,381
One day I got a call...

457
00:48:49,757 --> 00:48:52,089
...for a jumper.

458
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,228
A young Mexican girl.

459
00:48:56,764 --> 00:49:00,222
Pregnant, infected with AIDS,
totally strung-out.

460
00:49:00,835 --> 00:49:04,396
She was truly one of the doomed.

461
00:49:07,441 --> 00:49:11,343
I asked her to come in off
the ledge and into my arms.

462
00:49:11,912 --> 00:49:14,938
She asked me why
she should bother living.

463
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:23,653
What did you say?

464
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,524
I was trained
to tell her lots of things.

465
00:49:28,696 --> 00:49:31,995
Her dreams, all the people
who'd miss her.

466
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:35,768
But for a second, I hesitated.

467
00:49:36,904 --> 00:49:38,963
And she saw it.

468
00:49:42,176 --> 00:49:47,671
Within that second, I couldn't think of
one optimistic thing to say to her.

469
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:54,649
So she spread her arms
and jumped.

470
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,158
I started getting headaches...

471
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:07,628
...and eventually started blacking out.

472
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:13,238
So I filed for medical.

473
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,217
What?

474
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:35,290
What is it?

475
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:41,430
Rhodes!

476
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:46,699
-It's worse. Nothing but static!
-Where's that key from the actress?

477
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:50,473
This was on the kid.

478
00:50:52,146 --> 00:50:54,910
-What is it, some kind of countdown?
-Larry!

479
00:50:57,451 --> 00:51:01,046
What the fuck is he doing?
Larry, come over here!

480
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:05,489
Come over here, man.
What are you doing? Come over here.

481
00:51:06,894 --> 00:51:09,988
-What are you doing?
-I just went to get something.

482
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:14,628
We told you to watch the guy.
What are you doing in your office?

483
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:16,903
I just went to get something.

484
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:20,802
How many sets of keys are there
to this place? Look at me. How many?

485
00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:23,409
-Two and a master set.
-Oh, my fucking God!

486
00:51:24,245 --> 00:51:30,650
Larry, you mother--! You son of a--!
Get the fuck in here! Get in here!

487
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:35,280
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill my con?

488
00:51:35,456 --> 00:51:40,359
Holy shit! Who did that?
Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!

489
00:51:40,528 --> 00:51:42,120
Bullshit! You're lying!

490
00:51:42,296 --> 00:51:46,198
-It's your bat sticking out of his throat!
-I know, but I didn't do it!

491
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:48,096
Check the doors!

492
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:49,896
-I didn't do it!
-Look at him!

493
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,301
-Why'd you kill him?
-Why were you outside?

494
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:55,499
-Why'd you leave him?
-I was scared.

495
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:57,906
-What were you scared of?
-You wouldn't understand.

496
00:51:58,078 --> 00:51:59,545
Try me.

497
00:51:59,713 --> 00:52:01,476
-Why'd you kill my con?
-I didn't!

498
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:05,551
I don't know how--
I went to my office, that's all!

499
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:08,381
-Why'd you leave him?
-This your key? Number 8?

500
00:52:08,556 --> 00:52:11,184
Ten, nine, eight, huh?
This is your key!

501
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:13,326
You can't say that!
Those aren't my keys!

502
00:52:13,494 --> 00:52:16,463
That's like leading the witness
or something. Look.

503
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:20,327
These are my keys, okay?
These are my keys. You see?

504
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:24,235
You got a Gucci wallet?
It's the actress's.

505
00:52:24,405 --> 00:52:28,808
Yes, I took her wallet.
Afterwards. After she died!

506
00:52:28,976 --> 00:52:34,380
Afterwards, all right? I didn't kill her.
And I didn't kill him.

507
00:52:34,548 --> 00:52:39,315
-Let her go, Larry.
-Get back! You won't pin this on me.

508
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:41,512
-Timothy?
-Get him out of here!

509
00:52:41,689 --> 00:52:45,056
-Put it down.
-I didn't hurt anybody. No one!

510
00:52:45,226 --> 00:52:48,593
But I don't like cheap fucking whores!
If you take one more step--

511
00:52:48,762 --> 00:52:51,094
Fuck!

512
00:52:59,273 --> 00:53:01,241
Get it off!

513
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:06,205
Shit!

514
00:53:14,188 --> 00:53:16,952
Come on, you little bitch.
Please fucking start.

515
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:20,255
-Goddamn it!
-Hey!

516
00:53:21,195 --> 00:53:23,459
Larry, stop!

517
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,065
What is going on?

518
00:53:28,636 --> 00:53:30,934
-Larry!
-Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!

519
00:53:34,308 --> 00:53:36,936
Timothy! Timothy!

520
00:53:59,466 --> 00:54:01,832
An insanity plea was
refused by the court...

521
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:06,496
...despite the fact that my client
is a certifiable Axis IV dissociative.

522
00:54:06,674 --> 00:54:11,338
To this day, he remains unaware of
the crimes for which he was convicted.

523
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:17,314
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled
decisively that states cannot execute...

524
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:20,716
...a person who does not understand
why he's being put to death.

525
00:54:20,888 --> 00:54:22,185
He signed a confession.

526
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:25,883
-He didn't just sign it, he dictated it.
-Thirdly...

527
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:31,555
...Malcolm's diaries found
misfiled in state evidence.

528
00:54:31,732 --> 00:54:36,692
Your Honor, this notebook contains
entries made just before the murders.

529
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:41,204
Important to note are the spectacular
changes in handwriting style...

530
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,138
...tone, point of view.

531
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:48,145
What you are looking at are the private
thoughts of several different people.

532
00:54:48,315 --> 00:54:52,081
With permission,
Dr. Mallick will elaborate.

533
00:54:52,252 --> 00:54:54,720
Thank you.

534
00:54:55,022 --> 00:54:58,753
Your Honor, there is no
universally efficacious treatment...

535
00:54:58,926 --> 00:55:01,759
...for Dissociative Identity Disorder.

536
00:55:01,929 --> 00:55:06,195
In theory, one attempts to move
the patient towards integration.

537
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:10,963
-A folding of their fractured psyche.
-Your Honor?

538
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:12,838
He's here.

539
00:55:30,224 --> 00:55:32,920
No! What you saw was an accident!

540
00:55:33,093 --> 00:55:35,254
He ran out in front of me!
I'm not a murderer!

541
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:37,488
There's a dead body
in your freezer, Larry.

542
00:55:37,665 --> 00:55:40,190
-I didn't kill him. I found him like that.
-Stop it!

543
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:43,859
Listen! Listen! I was in Vegas last
month and I lost everything, okay?

544
00:55:44,038 --> 00:55:45,266
Everything!

545
00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:49,068
I drove west. I didn't know where
to go, but I was running on empty...

546
00:55:49,243 --> 00:55:51,677
...so I pulled in here at this place.

547
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:56,179
And there was no one at the station,
so I came over to the office...

548
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,147
...and I walked in.

549
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:01,185
And there, sitting at that desk
right there, was the manager...

550
00:56:01,355 --> 00:56:04,017
...facedown in a Banquet Potpie.
Dead!

551
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:07,490
-Heart attack or something.
-Banquet Potpie!

552
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:10,221
He'd been sitting there
for God knows how long.

553
00:56:10,397 --> 00:56:14,424
All of a sudden, this auto-parts
salesman pulls up, looking for a room.

554
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:16,865
I didn't have a fucking dime...

555
00:56:17,037 --> 00:56:19,631
...so I took his 30 and gave him one.

556
00:56:19,807 --> 00:56:24,107
I just took the key from the wall
and gave him a room.

557
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:28,578
Maybe that was wrong,
but I was broke, and that's what I did.

558
00:56:29,616 --> 00:56:31,641
Then I came back in here...

559
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:35,814
...and I moved Larry's body--
His name was Larry too.

560
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:39,618
I put him in the freezer.

561
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:44,959
I wasn't trying to hide him.
It was hot out.

562
00:56:45,132 --> 00:56:49,728
I thought it was the best place for him
till his family or someone came along.

563
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:52,428
Only no one did...

564
00:56:52,906 --> 00:56:55,636
...except more guests.

565
00:56:55,843 --> 00:56:58,710
So I checked them in too.

566
00:56:59,613 --> 00:57:02,104
And they all seemed happy...

567
00:57:02,282 --> 00:57:04,944
...so I just stayed.

568
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:09,149
Cry me a river.
This is a total crock of shit!

569
00:57:09,323 --> 00:57:11,757
-No, it's not!
-Admit it, you killed him!

570
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:14,689
Just like you killed my con.
Just like you killed her husband.

571
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:17,490
Just like you killed his actress.
Just admit it.

572
00:57:17,664 --> 00:57:21,361
-Say it, "I killed them."
-Stop it! He can't take any more!

573
00:57:21,535 --> 00:57:25,096
Everything is okay now. Everything
is fine. We got the guy. It's fine.

574
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:27,001
-I don't know what we got.
-What?

575
00:57:27,174 --> 00:57:29,642
We thought we got the guy
two hours ago, then--

576
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,176
You believe this shit?
It's him! It's this guy!

577
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:34,473
He had a knife to your neck,
remember?

578
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:38,812
His story's so unbelievable,
I think it just might be true.

579
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,019
She's got a point.

580
00:57:44,057 --> 00:57:46,218
You guys are crazy.

581
00:57:46,426 --> 00:57:48,656
Maybe it's the burial ground.

582
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:51,725
What?

583
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,564
Read the brochure in there.
It's all around us.

584
00:57:57,738 --> 00:58:00,832
A hundred years ago, the government
moved these Indians here.

585
00:58:01,008 --> 00:58:04,239
They all died
because there was no water.

586
00:58:06,313 --> 00:58:08,713
Now they're coming back to life
like sea monkeys, huh?

587
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:10,850
Come on.
Give me a break, sweetheart.

588
00:58:11,018 --> 00:58:13,350
-Just take it easy, Rhodes.
-You know, you take it easy!

589
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,217
You've tried to run this show all night.
Giving orders, pointing fingers!

590
00:58:17,391 --> 00:58:20,383
You blamed my con for everything,
and he ends up dead.

591
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:23,587
I'm telling you, it's him!
We all saw him run down George.

592
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:27,222
Your actress's wallet is right there.
She's dead, there's the wallet.

593
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:30,268
-What more do you want?
-Stop it! Please shut up!

594
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:34,466
All right. You want a plan?
Here's the plan, okay?

595
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:38,873
No one's gonna move. We'll stay
here, like this, in this room until dawn.

596
00:58:39,046 --> 00:58:41,207
No one leaves, no one moves.

597
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:44,350
And if he tries anything,
I'm gonna shoot him!

598
00:58:44,518 --> 00:58:47,715
And if something out there
comes in here, I'll shoot it!

599
00:58:47,888 --> 00:58:50,789
And if anyone of us tries anything,
I'll shoot them!

600
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:52,425
-We get it.
-Good!

601
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,728
Timmy? Timmy?

602
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:32,093
-You need to stay in here with us.
-It's all right.

603
00:59:38,805 --> 00:59:42,104
Remember that movie where
the 10 strangers went to an island...

604
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:44,676
...and then they all died
one by one...

605
00:59:44,845 --> 00:59:49,214
...and then it turned out they weren't
strangers, they all had a connection?

606
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:51,613
They all messed with the wrong guy,
and he was getting revenge.

607
00:59:51,785 --> 00:59:53,184
Shut up!

608
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:57,982
I'm just saying maybe there's
a connection between all of us.

609
00:59:58,425 --> 00:59:59,756
Like what?

610
01:00:00,327 --> 01:00:03,353
-We're all in Nevada.
-Shut up!

611
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:09,230
Where were you going with your con
when you pulled in here?

612
01:00:11,004 --> 01:00:14,440
Carson City. Okay?

613
01:00:15,943 --> 01:00:20,004
I was going home to Florida.
Where were you going?

614
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,045
I was taking the actress to L.A.

615
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:23,940
I was born in Florida.

616
01:00:25,052 --> 01:00:27,782
Since you been in that chair,
no one's died, so shut up!

617
01:00:27,955 --> 01:00:29,388
No one's died since we've
all been here!

618
01:00:29,556 --> 01:00:32,548
-Hey, sweetie, sit down.
-Where in Florida, Larry?

619
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:38,129
-Where in Florida?
-Friends now, huh? Great.

620
01:00:39,399 --> 01:00:42,732
-Polk County.
-That's where I was born.

621
01:00:42,903 --> 01:00:45,235
-Which town?
-Mulberry.

622
01:00:45,405 --> 01:00:48,670
-Frostproof.
-No wonder you left.

623
01:00:49,009 --> 01:00:51,102
There's a town called Frostproof?

624
01:00:51,478 --> 01:00:55,414
They grow oranges.
The name doubles as a slogan.

625
01:00:55,582 --> 01:00:59,348
I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk.
Why would you wanna go back?

626
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,488
I found a grove for sale
on the Internet.

627
01:01:02,656 --> 01:01:05,989
Nine acres, 1200 trees.
Limes and oranges.

628
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,321
According to the realtor, the soil
needs a few tills, phosphorous...

629
01:01:10,497 --> 01:01:16,902
...lanes need reading,
but it's real good land.

630
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:22,772
What?

631
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,435
It sounds nice.

632
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:47,227
Ed?

633
01:01:50,737 --> 01:01:52,967
She's dead.

634
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:14,994
Get him out of here.

635
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:18,798
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

636
01:02:25,572 --> 01:02:27,972
Look at this.

637
01:02:33,413 --> 01:02:36,849
-Where'd you get that?
-Right here.

638
01:02:41,088 --> 01:02:45,354
This doesn't make any sense.
She died from an accident.

639
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:49,985
George was an accident,
if you believe Larry.

640
01:02:52,966 --> 01:02:55,366
Where is seven?

641
01:02:58,071 --> 01:03:00,062
Back it up!

642
01:03:36,276 --> 01:03:40,975
-See, I told you it wasn't me!
-That's not possible.

643
01:03:41,148 --> 01:03:45,244
I was standing right there. I saw what
happened. We all saw what happened.

644
01:03:45,418 --> 01:03:48,945
He ran out. Nobody could have
known he was gonna do that.

645
01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:50,419
No one human.

646
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,058
We're back to that again?
It's the spirits, huh?

647
01:03:53,226 --> 01:03:57,287
Maybe it's the ghost of the guy
that Larry put in the freezer.

648
01:03:59,232 --> 01:04:01,166
Somebody untie me.
Goddamn it!

649
01:04:01,334 --> 01:04:03,029
You know it wasn't me.
Come on.

650
01:04:03,203 --> 01:04:03,336
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

651
01:04:03,336 --> 01:04:05,133
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

652
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:07,535
Take her car and get out.
You, her and the kid.

653
01:04:07,707 --> 01:04:08,935
There's nowhere to go.

654
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:11,134
-How much gas do you have?
-Half a tank.

655
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:13,404
You can drive till dawn on that.
Look at me.

656
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,242
When you get to where it's flooded,
go the other way.

657
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:17,781
I don't know if I can.

658
01:04:17,951 --> 01:04:21,079
Get the kid and go.
Right now. Come on.

659
01:04:21,254 --> 01:04:22,243
Timmy.

660
01:04:22,422 --> 01:04:25,050
Timmy, come on. Let's go.
Get up.

661
01:04:25,225 --> 01:04:26,385
What's going on?

662
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,289
-They can't leave!
-This way.

663
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:30,429
We'll see you
when the storm breaks.

664
01:04:30,597 --> 01:04:33,930
Hey! Hey! They can't leave!
Where are they going? Get back here!

665
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,692
Go, go, go!
They're leaving.

666
01:04:35,869 --> 01:04:37,234
-They're not leaving.
-Go!

667
01:04:37,404 --> 01:04:40,134
You can't let suspects leave
after four people have been killed!

668
01:04:40,307 --> 01:04:43,242
-You really think they're suspects?
-They're not leaving!

669
01:04:49,983 --> 01:04:51,507
Shit.

670
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:53,883
Ginny!

671
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:58,619
Extinguishers.
Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?

672
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:01,458
-Fire extinguisher! Where?
-Back there!

673
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:26,518
Nobody in there.

674
01:05:31,891 --> 01:05:34,883
Maybe it got so hot,
they got cremated.

675
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:37,120
There'd be something left.

676
01:05:41,401 --> 01:05:42,766
You did this.

677
01:05:43,403 --> 01:05:46,566
You did this!
You told them to get into the car!

678
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,207
Are you happy?

679
01:06:12,332 --> 01:06:14,493
Where is he?

680
01:07:14,928 --> 01:07:16,122
Nothing.

681
01:07:22,268 --> 01:07:24,600
I give up!

682
01:07:25,672 --> 01:07:28,300
I give up!
What the hell do you want?

683
01:07:28,475 --> 01:07:32,809
What do you want, you sick bastard?
What the fuck do you want from us?

684
01:07:34,414 --> 01:07:38,180
I am turning 30 next week
and I just want to go home...

685
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:40,080
...and grow oranges!

686
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,690
It's your birthday next week?

687
01:07:49,863 --> 01:07:52,764
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.

688
01:07:54,334 --> 01:07:55,631
Me too.

689
01:07:59,806 --> 01:08:01,239
Me too.

690
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:05,806
Yeah.

691
01:08:08,114 --> 01:08:10,639
George York, May 10.

692
01:08:10,817 --> 01:08:12,751
Alice York, May 10.

693
01:08:12,919 --> 01:08:14,750
Caroline Suzanne, May 10.

694
01:08:15,789 --> 01:08:18,349
Ginny and Lou Isiana, May 10.

695
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:20,925
Me, Larry Washington,
May fucking 10.

696
01:08:21,995 --> 01:08:24,793
What are the odds?
Must be 10 trillion-to-one.

697
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:28,661
What is it?

698
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:46,544
-Where's the fuse box, Larry?
-Other side of the building.

699
01:08:53,693 --> 01:08:55,718
Ginny and Lou Isiana.

700
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:59,127
Virginia and Louisiana.

701
01:08:59,299 --> 01:09:01,494
Caroline, Carolina.

702
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:05,360
Paris Nevada.

703
01:09:05,538 --> 01:09:07,165
George York.

704
01:09:08,141 --> 01:09:10,575
Larry Washington.

705
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:15,714
Rhodes, Rhode Island.

706
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:23,847
Ed Dakota.

707
01:09:37,971 --> 01:09:42,431
When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there

708
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:44,975
He wasn't there again today

709
01:09:45,144 --> 01:09:47,009
I wish
I wish he'd go away

710
01:09:48,781 --> 01:09:50,840
Who is this?

711
01:09:51,017 --> 01:09:53,986
Who am I speaking to right now?

712
01:09:56,723 --> 01:09:58,953
Where did you learn that poem?

713
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:01,525
Who am I speaking to?
Look at me.

714
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:03,958
Who am I speaking to right now?

715
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:11,798
Doc?

716
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:17,272
-Edward?
-What's happening?

717
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,272
-Please be quiet.
-He can hear what we're saying?

718
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,980
Of course I can hear
what you're fucking saying.

719
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:28,212
Edward, you missed your last
appointment. Where have you been?

720
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:33,689
-Did I black out again?
-Try and think back.

721
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,328
Where have you been?

722
01:10:36,496 --> 01:10:39,158
All right.
I was driving this actress...

723
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:44,797
...and we got stuck at the motel.
There was a storm.

724
01:10:45,738 --> 01:10:48,400
We couldn't get out
because of the storm.

725
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,736
What happened at the motel?

726
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,310
People started dying.

727
01:10:56,482 --> 01:10:59,508
And then their bodies--
It didn't make any sense.

728
01:10:59,686 --> 01:11:01,415
They disappeared.

729
01:11:03,957 --> 01:11:06,619
Edward, I'd like to show
something to you, if I may.

730
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:14,365
Do you recognize this man?

731
01:11:16,269 --> 01:11:17,702
No.

732
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:21,171
That man, Edward,
is Malcolm Rivers.

733
01:11:21,341 --> 01:11:24,936
He's had a very troubled life.
He was arrested four years ago...

734
01:11:25,111 --> 01:11:28,478
...and convicted of the murder
of six people in a violent rampage.

735
01:11:28,948 --> 01:11:31,178
-He did this.
-Detective, please.

736
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:32,978
Edward, listen to me.

737
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:39,291
When faced with an intense trauma,
a child's mind may fracture...

738
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:43,020
...creating disassociated identities.

739
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:47,266
That's exactly what happened
to Malcolm Rivers.

740
01:11:47,433 --> 01:11:49,833
He developed a condition
that is commonly known...

741
01:11:50,003 --> 01:11:52,904
...as Multiple Personality Syndrome.

742
01:11:58,144 --> 01:12:00,078
Why are you telling me this?

743
01:12:01,347 --> 01:12:03,611
Because you, Edward...

744
01:12:03,783 --> 01:12:06,911
...are one of his personalities.

745
01:12:11,391 --> 01:12:13,018
What?

746
01:12:27,607 --> 01:12:30,872
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
did you do to my face?

747
01:12:31,044 --> 01:12:32,739
-Keep calm.
-Where is my face?

748
01:12:32,912 --> 01:12:35,403
-That is your face.
-Why am I tied up?

749
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:37,173
-Keep calm.
-Where is--?

750
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,874
-Please.
-Jesus Christ!

751
01:12:39,052 --> 01:12:41,213
-Where is my face?
-Stay calm.

752
01:12:41,387 --> 01:12:45,084
No! I'm not gonna stay calm!
Why am I tied up like this?

753
01:12:45,258 --> 01:12:48,716
Who are all these people?
What happened at the motel?

754
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,921
-Where is everybody?
-They don't exist, Edward.

755
01:12:52,098 --> 01:12:54,692
You were all created
by Malcolm as a child.

756
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:57,267
-You're a liar!
-Consider what you know.

757
01:12:57,437 --> 01:12:59,803
-Everyone named after a state.
-No.

758
01:12:59,972 --> 01:13:03,430
Everyone sharing the same birthday.
Your blackouts.

759
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:05,076
No! I was a cop!

760
01:13:05,244 --> 01:13:08,975
I was a cop in the Rampart Division
of L.A.P.D. for six years.

761
01:13:09,148 --> 01:13:10,172
Edward, please.

762
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:12,749
I live in Hollywood,
in a studio apartment.

763
01:13:12,919 --> 01:13:15,285
-You don't live there.
-I do live there!

764
01:13:15,555 --> 01:13:17,318
You don't live anywhere.

765
01:13:17,657 --> 01:13:21,718
I know this is difficult to accept,
but the face you saw in that mirror...

766
01:13:21,894 --> 01:13:27,196
...is the face I've always seen when
I talk to Edward or Paris or Larry...

767
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:29,300
...or anyone else you've met tonight.

768
01:13:29,469 --> 01:13:33,405
Malcolm is in the midst
of a medical treatment.

769
01:13:33,573 --> 01:13:39,136
One which forces all his identities to
confront one another for the first time.

770
01:13:39,312 --> 01:13:41,837
I knew there would be violence...

771
01:13:42,014 --> 01:13:47,247
...and with it, the number
of the identities would be reduced.

772
01:13:49,589 --> 01:13:51,489
Reduced?

773
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:54,455
One of the personalities
you've met tonight, Edward...

774
01:13:54,627 --> 01:13:57,528
...committed those murders
four years ago.

775
01:13:57,897 --> 01:14:01,663
He took control of Malcolm's body,
as you have now...

776
01:14:01,834 --> 01:14:07,033
...and released an unspeakable rage.
And in 19 hours...

777
01:14:07,206 --> 01:14:10,767
...Malcolm Rivers will be put to death
because of those actions...

778
01:14:10,943 --> 01:14:14,811
...unless I can convince that man...

779
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:17,381
...that the killer is gone.

780
01:14:20,653 --> 01:14:23,087
I need you to stay with me.
Edward?

781
01:14:23,256 --> 01:14:26,555
I need your help.
I need your help to finish this.

782
01:14:27,126 --> 01:14:28,889
Edward, listen to me.

783
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:31,824
Edward, stay with me.

784
01:14:31,998 --> 01:14:34,865
Listen to me.
I need you to understand.

785
01:14:35,034 --> 01:14:38,197
The killer cannot survive.

786
01:14:38,371 --> 01:14:39,633
Edward!

787
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:08,357
Got it?

788
01:15:09,435 --> 01:15:12,996
I can't see a thing.
Is there a flashlight?

789
01:15:13,172 --> 01:15:14,799
Hang on. Hang on.

790
01:15:15,308 --> 01:15:19,039
-You got a flashlight?
-Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Goddamn it.

791
01:16:03,823 --> 01:16:05,290
Shut up!

792
01:16:11,397 --> 01:16:14,195
Hey. What am I
supposed to wear, man?

793
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:16,164
You're in it.

794
01:16:28,047 --> 01:16:29,036
Larry.

795
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:33,216
Larry, come here.

796
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:41,217
Ed!

797
01:16:49,635 --> 01:16:51,569
Ed!

798
01:17:05,818 --> 01:17:07,786
Larry!

799
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:15,693
-Larry!
-Paris.

800
01:17:16,696 --> 01:17:17,822
Paris.

801
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,497
Larry?

802
01:17:25,638 --> 01:17:28,539
Larry? Larry?

803
01:17:31,644 --> 01:17:34,374
Where are the keys to the truck?

804
01:17:34,547 --> 01:17:36,674
Where are the keys to the truck?

805
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,983
-That was good, Larry.
-We gotta get out of here.

806
01:17:44,156 --> 01:17:47,182
-Ed has the keys to the truck.
-I got a spare right here.

807
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,329
-Where is he?
-I don't know. Here.

808
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:54,265
-What are you doing?
-We need a gun.

809
01:17:55,368 --> 01:17:56,460
Holy shit!

810
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:01,906
Give me the keys to the truck.

811
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:03,629
Ed!

812
01:19:03,803 --> 01:19:05,703
We gotta get out of here!

813
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:08,169
-Paris--
-He's coming. He's--

814
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,672
-Stay here.
-What's wrong with you?

815
01:19:10,843 --> 01:19:13,573
Paris, listen to me.

816
01:19:13,746 --> 01:19:16,146
Stay here.

817
01:19:17,349 --> 01:19:19,544
It's gonna be okay.

818
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:47,735
Throw me the keys to the truck, Ed.

819
01:19:49,849 --> 01:19:53,444
Throw me the keys to the truck.
Stay there. Stay there!

820
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:29,816
Ed! Ed! Ed!

821
01:20:35,094 --> 01:20:37,528
Ed, let me see.

822
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:39,425
We gotta get you to a hospital.

823
01:20:39,598 --> 01:20:41,691
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

824
01:20:41,867 --> 01:20:44,768
Stay with me because
I'm gonna get you to the truck.

825
01:20:44,937 --> 01:20:48,566
Put your arm around my neck.
You gotta hold on, okay?

826
01:20:48,741 --> 01:20:54,407
You with me, Ed? Stay with me.
Okay. One, two, three.

827
01:20:55,481 --> 01:20:59,815
You gotta help me get you up.
Ed, you gotta push a little bit.

828
01:21:01,754 --> 01:21:05,121
Ed, why won't you let me help you?

829
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,252
Where did you go before?

830
01:21:08,427 --> 01:21:12,227
What did you see?
Tell me what you saw.

831
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:17,795
I saw you.

832
01:21:21,707 --> 01:21:25,108
I saw you in an orange grove.

833
01:21:54,974 --> 01:21:57,841
Why won't you let me help you?

834
01:21:58,978 --> 01:22:01,344
Where did you go?

835
01:22:01,513 --> 01:22:03,572
What did you see?

836
01:22:06,919 --> 01:22:09,217
I saw you...

837
01:22:10,956 --> 01:22:14,289
...in an orange grove.

838
01:22:50,462 --> 01:22:55,764
The question, Your Honor, is whether
to convict the body or the mind.

839
01:22:56,368 --> 01:22:59,963
His body committed these murders,
that is true.

840
01:23:00,139 --> 01:23:02,403
The person who remains
inside did not.

841
01:23:02,574 --> 01:23:04,132
Judge Taylor, that may not be true--

842
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:06,801
We witnessed the destruction
of 10 identities tonight.

843
01:23:06,979 --> 01:23:08,742
Nine were innocent
and one was guilty.

844
01:23:08,914 --> 01:23:09,903
They're not real!

845
01:23:10,082 --> 01:23:12,380
The violence that existed in him
has been executed.

846
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:17,215
Your Honor, Malcolm belongs
in a state hospital.

847
01:23:21,593 --> 01:23:26,394
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, it is
the recommendation of this court...

848
01:23:26,565 --> 01:23:29,227
...that Mr. Rivers' execution
be stayed.

849
01:23:29,401 --> 01:23:33,235
I am transferring Mr. Rivers
to state psychiatric services...

850
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:36,574
...under the care of Dr. Mallick.

851
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:57,185
Cracked heels and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn

852
01:23:57,361 --> 01:24:01,661
But it's not that way
I wasn't born to lose you

853
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:04,130
I want you

854
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:06,496
I want you

855
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:10,902
I want you so bad

856
01:25:23,513 --> 01:25:25,276
Timmy.

857
01:25:53,744 --> 01:25:55,507
No, please don't.

858
01:25:56,947 --> 01:26:00,678
No, Timmy, please.

859
01:26:00,851 --> 01:26:02,819
What is it, Malcolm?

860
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:12,555
Malcolm?

861
01:26:12,729 --> 01:26:14,924
Whores don't get a second chance.

862
01:26:32,582 --> 01:26:35,380
When I was going up the stairs

863
01:26:35,552 --> 01:26:39,386
I met a man who wasn't there

864
01:26:39,556 --> 01:26:42,252
He wasn't there again today

865
01:26:42,426 --> 01:26:46,157
I wish
I wish he'd go away
