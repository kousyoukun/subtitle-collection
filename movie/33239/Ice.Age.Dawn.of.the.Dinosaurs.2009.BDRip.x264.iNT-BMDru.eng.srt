4
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:21,213
It's happening!

5
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:26,948
Wait up guys!

6
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,394
The baby is coming! The baby
is coming! I'm having a baby.

7
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:39,513
- Code blue, code blue,
- Or pink if it's a girl

8
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:43,214
Coming up baby! Coming up baby!
I'm coming, Ellie!

9
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:45,509
We got it.

10
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:04,485
- Ellie, Ellie, Where are you, Where am I ?
- Manny!

11
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:09,595
I told you! It was just a kick.

12
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:14,600
Ohh right! Right, oh wow.

13
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,500
Ohh you really gave daddy a scare!
Daddy got silly.

14
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,861
Daddy fall down cliff and go,
boom, boom, boom. Silly daddy.

15
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,141
Sorry, folks. False alarm.
It was just a kick.

16
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,478
- Do you know who I want to kick?
- That's the third false alarm this week.

17
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,233
Allright show's over...
break it up, break it up!

18
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:48,592
- Oh I see someone else who has a bun in the oven?
- I'm not pregnant!

19
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:53,076
Too bad, you'd make
a wonderful mother.

20
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:58,289
Manny I know your excited, I am too,
but your getting a little carried away.

21
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:03,816
Okay, okay, Boy, your
starting to sound like Diego.

22
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:08,716
Wait a second... Where is Diego?

23
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,335
My hooves are burning, baby!
They are burning!

24
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,653
Oh, look at this, I got to tip-Toe!
I got to tip-Toe! Eat my dust, dingo!

25
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:18,265
- Huh, can I look now?
- Easy, don't freak out the baby.

26
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:22,332
The baby is fine. It's the freaked
out daddy I'm worried about.

27
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:25,564
Ah-Uh-Uh, No peeking.

28
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:30,569
<i>- Voila! Playground for junior...
- Ohh wow!</i>

29
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:42,247
It's amazing.

30
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:58,305
- Ohh Manny...
- I made it myself, our family.

31
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:05,708
Hey why aren't I up there?

32
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,192
- You can be on ours.
- You'd fit right in.

33
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:15,614
Of course it's still work in progress.
Few rough edges, here and there.

34
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:21,975
- I don't believe it, your trying to baby proof nature.
- Baby proof nature? Get outta here.

35
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,937
That's ridiculous.

36
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,838
Manny, this is the world our baby's
gonna grow up in. You can't change that.

37
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:35,738
Of course I can, I'm the
biggest thing on earth.

38
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:41,995
Okay big daddy, I can't wait to see,
how you handle the teen years.

39
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:46,791
Come on, Sid. I don't want you
touching anything. This place is for kids.

40
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:53,360
Are you a kid?
Don't answer that.

41
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:07,332
Diego, there you are.
You missed the big surprise.

42
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:11,503
- I'll check it out later.
- Okay, See ya.

43
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:15,674
- You know, I think there's something bothering, Diego.
- No, I'm sure everything's fine.

44
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:20,158
- You should talk to him.
- Guys don't talk to guys, about guy problems.

45
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:25,059
- We just punch each other on the shoulders.
- That's stupid!

46
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:30,689
To a girl, but for a guy, that's
like six months of therapy.

47
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,590
Okay, Okay I'm going.

48
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:40,386
- Hey.
- Oww!

49
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:46,851
- Why'd you do that?
- I don't know.

50
00:08:47,164 --> 00:08:53,107
So listen, Ellie thinks theres
something bothering you...

51
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:59,155
Actually, I've been thinking, that soon,
it might be time for me to head out.

52
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,326
Okay, so I'll just tell her that
your fine. It was nothing.

53
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:09,843
Look, who are we kidding, Manny? I'm losing my edge.
I'm not really built for chaperoning play-Dates.

54
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:11,355
What do you talking about?

55
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:15,317
Having a family, that's huge.
And I'm happy for you, but...

56
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,218
- It's your adventure, not mine.
- So you don't want to be around my kid?

57
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:23,346
No, no, no, t-Thats...
your taking this the wrong way.

58
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:27,100
No go, go find some adventure.
Mr. Adventure guy!

59
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,688
Don't let my boring domestic life
hit you on the bottom, on your way out.

60
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:35,858
Isn't Ellie supposed to be the
one with the hormonal imbalance?

61
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:39,925
Manny, wait! No one has to leave.

62
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:42,949
- So?
- That's why guys don't talk to guys.

63
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:48,475
- Why what happened.
- Diego's leaving.

64
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:54,314
Whoa, whoa, this should be the best
time of our lives. We're having a baby.

65
00:09:54,314 --> 00:10:00,675
- No, Sid. They're havin' a baby
- Yeah but, we're a herd. We're a family

66
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:06,097
Look things have changed.
Manny has other priority's now.

67
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:12,458
Face  it, Sid. We had a great run,
but... now it's time to move on.

68
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:18,401
- So it's just the two of us.
- No, Sid. It's not the two of us.

69
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:22,155
Crash and Eddie, are coming with us?

70
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:26,951
Just, Crash?
Just, Eddie?

71
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:32,373
Goodbye, Sid.

72
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:47,388
Okay, calm down. Calm down.
I'm good at making friends.

73
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:51,351
I'll make my own herd.
That's what I'll do!

74
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:56,773
<i>Hey! "Me amigo's. Que pasa?"</i>

75
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:07,096
Well, at least you still got your looks.

76
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,817
Ohh great!!

77
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:29,722
Anybody here?

78
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:51,724
Hello?

79
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:03,506
Oh poor guys, I know what
it's like to feel abandoned

80
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:13,829
Don't worry,
you're not alone anymore.

81
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:46,466
There you go.

82
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:03,983
Stay here! You take care of your brother
now, momma's coming right back.

83
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:08,571
Momma's coming, baby!

84
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:15,453
I got you.

85
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,188
What did I just tell you kids?

86
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:29,173
Ohh, thank you, thank you,
thank you!

87
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:33,865
Bad eggs, rotten eggs. A heart
attack you almost gave me.

88
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:40,851
Ohh I'm sorry darling, it's
just that I love you so much.

89
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:43,145
Hello!

90
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:47,837
I'd like to present, Eggbert,
Shelly and Yoko.

91
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:51,904
Sid, whatever you're doing.
It's a bad idea!

92
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:57,013
- Shh! My kids will hear you.
- They're not your kids, Sid. Take them back.

93
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,463
- You're not meant to be a parent.
- Why not?

94
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,914
First sign: stealing
someone else's eggs.

95
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:05,667
Second sign: one of them
almost became an omelet.

96
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:11,715
- Sid, someone must be worried sick looking for them.
- No, they were underground, in ice.

97
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:17,137
If it wasn't for me they'd be...
Egg sickles.

98
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:21,621
Sid, I know what your going through.
You're gonna have a family too someday.

99
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:29,128
You gonna meet a nice girl, with... with low
standards, no real options, or sense of smell...

100
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:33,716
- What Manny means to say is...
- No, I get it. I'll take them back.

101
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:39,347
You have your family and I'm
better off alone. By myself.

102
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,205
A fortress of solitude.

103
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:48,001
In the ice, for ever!

104
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:51,130
Alone, lonely loner..

105
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,945
- That's a lot of aloners.
- Precisely!

106
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:57,333
- Sid, wait.
- No, no, it's ok.

107
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:01,974
He'll bounce back, it's one of
the advantages of being Sid.

108
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:15,738
Why should I take you back.
I love kids.

109
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:22,307
I'm responsible, loving, nurturing.
What do you think?

110
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:28,042
I knew you would agree.

111
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:35,653
Oh oh, don't cry!
I'll find a dry place.

112
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:44,099
Let me just dry you off.

113
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,981
I don't know, being
a parents, a lot of work.

114
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:54,422
Maybe I'm not ready.

115
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:35,461
Mamma, mama, mama!

116
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,925
I'm a mommy.

117
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:45,262
Where's mommy?

118
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:49,537
Here I am!

119
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,917
There you go, nice clean faces.

120
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,894
I got it! I got it!

121
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:20,089
Stop it, no.

122
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,406
Hey, no biting!

123
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:32,393
I'm sorry, no, it's okay, it's okay.
Don't cry! Why you still crying?

124
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:38,440
Are you hungry? Maybe your hungry.
I know just the thing.

125
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:50,014
<i>...this is animal</ i>
I am your baby and this is my milk </ i></i>

126
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:56,375
Ahhhh!!!
I thought you were a female!

127
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:26,361
I'm sorry, but you can't go in.
Manny says, It's just for kids.

128
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:31,678
Wait a minute...
You are kids!

129
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:34,911
Just don't break anything!

130
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:41,480
- The Sloth says the playground's open!
- No, wait. Not for everyone!!

131
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:49,822
No, no. Don't touch that!

132
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:58,685
- What are they?
- Who cares? Their fun!

133
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:04,107
- Mommy, his not sharing.
- Aren't you gonna do something. - Why my kid had it first.

134
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:08,278
- Did not!
- Did to!

135
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,633
liar,liar,pants on fire

136
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:13,491
- What is the matter with you?
- I'm a single mother with 3 kids.

137
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:16,933
I could use a little compassion.

138
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,876
- No don't!
- No, don't! Stop.

139
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:29,340
- Ronald!
- Whoa! That's insane.

140
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:34,867
Stop! Stop! Stop!

141
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:43,521
- Hold on,  Little Johnny!
- I'm trying!

142
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:49,048
You know, experts say that you should
let the kids eat whatever they want.

143
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:55,825
- Do you think my ankles look fat?
- Ankles. What ankles?

144
00:22:57,702 --> 00:23:01,769
Ronald, Where did you come from?

145
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:04,688
Oh No!!

146
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:09,485
Okay come on spit him out!
If you don't spit out, Little Johnny,

147
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:13,551
We're leaving the playground
this instantly, one...

148
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:18,452
...two .. Don't make me say three.

149
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:23,874
- There we are, a picture of health.
- That's not little Johnny.

150
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:28,045
- Well better than nothing.
- Madison!

151
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:31,799
- Come on, barf him up!
- Sid!

152
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:37,429
- Hello, Manny.
- Little Johnny!

153
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:43,477
Oh wait... No! No!

154
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:46,918
Oh I'm really sorry.

155
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:58,388
- This place is totalled.
- And we didn't reck it. - We're losing our touch bro!

156
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:03,914
The important thing is that no
one got hurt. Except for that guy.

157
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:08,085
And, and those three... and her.

158
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:14,654
I told you to take them back, and
you kept them! Now look what they've done.

159
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:19,659
- Okay granted, we do have some discipline issues.
- Eating kids is not a discipline issue.

160
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:25,602
- But he spit them out!
- Well that's super, lets give him a gold star!

161
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:31,963
They don't belong here, Sid. Whatever they are
wherever you found them, take them back.

162
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:36,029
Manny, I'm not getting rid of my kids!

163
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:39,262
Earthquake!

164
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:43,746
It's Okay, It's okay, mamma's here!

165
00:24:44,788 --> 00:24:48,855
Do earthquakes, shriek?

166
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:21,804
- I thought those guys were extinct.
- Well then, that is one *angry* fossil. Sid!

167
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,975
Come on, inside, inside, inside.

168
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:45,265
Nobody move a muscle!

169
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:19,153
No, no, no, don't cry.

170
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:25,097
We are poor little lambs
who have lost our way.

171
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:43,240
- Sid! Give them to her. She's their mother.
- How do I know, she's their mother?

172
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:50,956
- What do you want, a birth certificate? She's a *Dinosaur*!
- Well I've put in the, blood, sweat and tears to raise them.

173
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:57,004
- For a day! Give them back, you Lunatic!
- Look these are my kids!

174
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:02,739
And your gonna have to go
through me to get them!

175
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:10,872
- Sid!
- Help!

176
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:22,342
- Run!
- Don't you have anything better to do?

177
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:27,868
- Help!
- Sid?

178
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:47,158
- Sid must be down there.
- Well, his dead! Real shame.

179
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:52,684
- He will be missed.
- Oh no, no, no. Not so fast.

180
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:57,689
Okay. Ellie, this is where I draw the line.
You, Crash and Eddie back to the village.

181
00:27:57,689 --> 00:28:03,424
- Yeah that's gonna happen.
- Ellie! You saw that thing? This is gonna be dangerous.

182
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:09,576
- Talk to the trunk.
- Oh great, after we save Sid! I'm gonna kill him.

183
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:12,340
- Ladies first!
- Age before beauty!

184
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:16,354
- No pain no gain!
- What pain?

185
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:29,596
- Sid?
- Sid?

186
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:45,028
Oh no, no, no! Not good. Not good.

187
00:28:45,341 --> 00:28:49,199
Ellie! Ellie! Wait up!

188
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:57,750
Okay look, if you feel anything,
even if it's nothing. You gotta tell me. And we're outta here.

189
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:03,484
We need a code word.
Yeah, something that says, "the baby's coming."

190
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:07,968
Hmm. How about, "Aaah! The
baby's coming!" How's that?

191
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:13,599
Nah, too long. We need something
short and punchy, like, uh... "peaches"!

192
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:18,917
- Peaches?
- I love peaches, they're sweet and round and fuzzy.

193
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:21,836
- Just like you.
- You think I'm round?

194
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:28,822
Uhh... Round is good.
Round is, foxy!

195
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:41,960
Stay close.

196
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:06,464
- Are you guys havin' the same dream I am?
- We've been living above an entire world.

197
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:10,948
And we didn't even know it.

198
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:35,451
Run for it! Hurry.

199
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:46,817
- Diego, what are you doing here?
- Sight seeing. Looking for Sid, same as you!

200
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:52,656
- Well aren't you noble.
- This is not the time guys. We need all the help we can get!

201
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:06,003
never mind

202
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:19,662
Here, boy. Here, come on!

203
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:25,710
- Are you nuts! We're not getting on that thing!
- It's either this dinosaur, or that one!

204
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:34,156
Pregnant lady, wants a lift.
Yabba, dabba, Do!

205
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,981
Don't ever, yabba, dabba, do that again!

206
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:57,930
- I feel so... puny.
- How do you think I feel?

207
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:23,997
Take cover!

208
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:16,029
Dude, you're awesome!
You're like the brother I never had! Me too.

209
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:31,044
Can we keep him?

210
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:34,432
- Buck.
- What?

211
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:36,987
The name's Buck.
Short for, Buck-Minster.

212
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:40,741
Long for, buh!

213
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,120
A little dull.

214
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:48,874
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.

215
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:54,817
Well, his dead. Welcome to my world.
Now, uh, go home.

216
00:33:55,026 --> 00:33:57,789
- Off you pop!
- Not without, Sid.

217
00:33:56,643 --> 00:34:00,240
Ellie wait, maybe the
deranged hermit has a point.

218
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:06,496
- Manny! We came this far, we're gonna find him.
- I got tracks.

219
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:10,250
Let's go.

220
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:16,610
If you go in there, you'll find
your friend... in the AFTER-LIFE!

221
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,302
How do you know? Oh
great and wisely, weasely one.

222
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:35,066
Mummy dinosaur carrying three babies,
and some floppy green thing?

223
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:39,133
- Yeah, we're friends with the floppy green thing.
- You got all that from the tracks?

224
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:43,929
No, not really. I saw 'em come through here earlier.
She's headed for Lava Falls.

225
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,891
That's where they care, for the newborns.

226
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:52,062
To get there! You got to go
through the jungle of misery.

227
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:56,024
Across the chasm of death.

228
00:34:56,442 --> 00:35:01,342
- To the plates of wow.
- Wow!!!

229
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:06,764
Okay! Good luck with the slow decadence
to madness, we're gonna go now.

230
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:14,011
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Whoa!
What, you-You think this is some sort of tropical getaway?

231
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:17,087
You can't protect your mate! Mate!.

232
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:20,476
What are you gonna do
with those-Those flimsy tusks..?

233
00:35:20,477 --> 00:35:24,073
When you run into the Beast?

234
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,931
I call him "Rudy".

235
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:34,918
Oh good. Good. I was worried it was
something intimidating, like, Sheldon or Tim.

236
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:38,254
Wait! You mean there's something
*bigger* than Mommy Dinosaur..?

237
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,401
Aye!

238
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,799
- Aye?
- Aye! Aye!

239
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:47,222
- He's the one that gave me *this*
- Whoa. He gave you that patch?

240
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:52,748
- For free? That's so cool.
- Yeah, maybe he'll give *us* one, too!

241
00:35:56,189 --> 00:36:01,090
Welcome to my world.

242
00:36:02,028 --> 00:36:06,564
- Abandon all hope, he who enters there!
- Alright we get it.

243
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:11,100
Doom and despair.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

244
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:29,094
Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.

245
00:37:40,147 --> 00:37:44,735
- Hold on.
- Why, what's wrong? Peaches?

246
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:50,261
- No, it's just I got a funny feeling.
- You're hungry. Low blood sugar!

247
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:56,100
- There's some fruit. - No, Manny!
- I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

248
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:02,044
- This isn't exactly your playground.
- Like I'm going to be afraid of a pretty flower.

249
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:08,613
- Bet you didn't see that coming?
- Manny?

250
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:12,888
For the record, I blame you for this.

251
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:17,372
Stop eating our friends, plant!

252
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:27,382
- That's it, I'm tearing it up, from the roots.
- Do that and it'll clamp-Shut forever.

253
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:30,770
Alright, preggers.
Don't get your trunk in a knot.

254
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:33,846
- I'll have them out of there before they're digested.
- Digested?

255
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:35,775
They'll be nothing
but bones in 3 minutes.

256
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:39,581
- Well maybe 5 for the fat one!
- I'm not fat!

257
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:43,961
- I feel tingly.
- Don't say that, when your pressed up against me.

258
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:50,008
- Not that kind of tingly.
- I can feel it too.

259
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:53,554
- Help, someone help us!
- Hurry!

260
00:38:53,554 --> 00:38:57,725
It's time to get... Buck wild.

261
00:39:06,483 --> 00:39:09,716
Who's fat now?

262
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:34,324
No!

263
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:19,264
- Tourists.
- Puked on by a plant. Awesome!

264
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:24,686
- Say something.
- Thank's for saving us.

265
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:30,734
- Will you help us find the floppy green thing?
- That's not necessary. - Yes it is.

266
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:38,033
Alright I'll help ya. But I got
rules. Rule number one:

267
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:41,995
Always listen to Buck.
Rule number two:

268
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:47,730
Stay in the middle of the trail.
Rule number three:

269
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:55,655
He who has gas, travels
at the back of the pack.

270
00:40:57,115 --> 00:41:02,015
- Come on then, chop, chop!
- We should all have our heads examined.

271
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:08,376
That's rule number four.
Now, let's go find your friend.

272
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:31,003
Oh it's okay, it's okay. Don't
worry, we're gonna be fine.

273
00:41:31,003 --> 00:41:35,695
Please swing a little more to...?

274
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:44,245
See, she's putting us down...

275
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:48,729
No! I'm too young to be eaten.

276
00:41:49,459 --> 00:41:55,715
Wow! Nice mucus. And I
don't care for, everyone.

277
00:42:08,436 --> 00:42:12,398
Listen these things get complicated.
Maybe we can work something out.

278
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:17,716
I can have them on Sundays to Tuesdays?
Wednesdays to Fridays? Weekends!

279
00:42:24,598 --> 00:42:27,830
It's Okay, mommas okay!

280
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:35,547
If you eat me, it will send a bad message.

281
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,533
Ha! Score one for the sloth!

282
00:42:45,974 --> 00:42:50,144
And the scores all tied up.

283
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:58,278
- Do you think the beast will find, Sid?
- Or more importantly, us?

284
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:05,994
Rudy? Are you joking? He's relentless.
He knows all, sees all eats all.

285
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:09,643
So that's a, yes.

286
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:16,838
Hey, get off my lawn! Go on shoo!!

287
00:43:21,217 --> 00:43:27,056
I knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.
You know, before he came out.

288
00:43:27,056 --> 00:43:32,061
So your just living down here by your wits!
All on your own, no responsibilities?

289
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:38,630
Not one! It's incredible. No dependence,
no limits, the greatest life a single guy can have.

290
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,654
Did you hear that?
This is my kind of place.

291
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:47,806
Hello? No... No I can't really talk right now...
I'm trying to recover a dead sloth.

292
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:54,792
Now, They're following Me!
I know! They think I'm crazy.

293
00:43:54,792 --> 00:44:00,006
O-Okay... We're going into the Chasm of Death,
I'm gonna lose you. I love you too.

294
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,490
Alright, goodbye. Goodbye, bye.
Okay, follow me!

295
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:09,078
That's you in three weeks.

296
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:30,766
- So, why do they call it the chasm of death?
- Well we tried, 'big smelly crack',

297
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:35,458
- But... uhh, that just made everybody giggle.
- Well now what?

298
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:43,487
- Madam...
- She is not doing that.

299
00:44:43,487 --> 00:44:46,198
Rule number one.

300
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:52,246
Come on, mammoth.
You supposed to have a good memory.

301
00:44:52,246 --> 00:44:55,061
Always listen to Buck.

302
00:44:58,502 --> 00:45:03,611
Now! Eyes forward.
Back straight... and uh, yes,

303
00:45:03,611 --> 00:45:06,009
- Breathe in the toxic fumes and you'll probably die.
- Toxic fumes.

304
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,432
- Just another day in paradise.
- Wait!

305
00:45:11,432 --> 00:45:13,621
Geronimo!

306
00:45:23,631 --> 00:45:30,617
- Ellie! You okay? - You have to try this.
- Alright now pile on everyone, couldn't be easier.

307
00:45:35,518 --> 00:45:42,713
Don't panic! Just some, technical
difficulties. Keep holding it in boys.

308
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:52,723
- I can't take it anymore.
- He breathe it. And now I'm breathing it.

309
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:58,979
- Hey we're not dead.
- You sound ridiculous.

310
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:02,733
Me? You should hear you.

311
00:46:04,818 --> 00:46:07,634
Alright, alright.
And one, and two...

312
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:12,639
<i> - Christmas, Christmas time is here...</ i>
- Are you crazy?</i>

313
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,914
It's not poison.

314
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:24,943
It's so disturbing.

315
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:32,554
- Stop laughing, all of you!
- "Stop laughing, all of you!"

316
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:38,081
What's rule number one?

317
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:45,588
- They're just laughing, what's so bad about that?
- They died laughing.

318
00:46:47,882 --> 00:46:51,844
- Stop laughing!
- Do you know what's funny though?

319
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:57,788
We're trying to save Sid
and now we're all gonna die!

320
00:46:58,101 --> 00:47:03,419
- And I don't even like Sid.
- Who does? He's an idiot!

321
00:47:04,357 --> 00:47:08,528
Thank's for getting me into this mess.
It's the most fun I've had in years.

322
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:14,576
Thank you, for deserting the herd.
That was totally super.

323
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:25,733
Stop that! Don't you see?
We're all gonna die.

324
00:47:30,008 --> 00:47:32,302
We gotta do everything, huh?

325
00:47:39,183 --> 00:47:46,378
- Sometimes I wet my bed.
- That's alright. Sometimes I wet your bed.

326
00:47:56,805 --> 00:48:02,957
- I'm not sure how much of that you could hear?
- Oh I heard all of it.

327
00:48:02,957 --> 00:48:07,649
- You wet my bed?
- That was, gas talk dude!.

328
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:12,967
- Well, we better get moving.
- Aren't we forgetting something?

329
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:17,659
I'm so lonely.

330
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:40,391
Okay. Here you go guys...
Muncher, muncher.

331
00:48:45,396 --> 00:48:52,903
What! Your not gonna eat your vegetables?
How you going to become big and strong, dinosaurs?

332
00:48:55,927 --> 00:49:04,581
No... I raised them vegetarian.
It's a healthier lifestyle I mean look at me.

333
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:10,316
Excuse me. I'm trying to
have a conversation here.

334
00:49:15,738 --> 00:49:21,160
No, no, no! That's not for us kids.
Way to feathery and fleshy and.

335
00:49:21,682 --> 00:49:24,393
...and alive!

336
00:49:30,545 --> 00:49:36,175
No, no, no, we do not
eat live animals, period.

337
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:40,346
Now go, fly. Be free.

338
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:45,977
Little, flightless bird.

339
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:51,190
- My bad.
- Hey, where you going?

340
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:57,030
This is how you resolve a conflict?
No wonder your single.

341
00:49:59,532 --> 00:50:04,954
Oh come on. Am I talking to myself here?
I say they're vegetarian, you say, 'Grrrr' .

342
00:50:04,954 --> 00:50:10,689
I say can we talk about this? You say,
Grrrr. I don't call that communication.

343
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:13,504
See, that's your answer to everything.

344
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:30,501
What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on, Earth.

345
00:50:32,586 --> 00:50:34,880
Aren't you?

346
00:50:47,288 --> 00:50:52,085
- They'll never survive, it's dangerous by day!
- But it's even worse at night.

347
00:50:52,085 --> 00:50:56,985
- Plus the guide is a lunatic! What
you mean, Buck? Oh his whack-O.

348
00:50:56,985 --> 00:51:01,990
I am not. Totally bonkers! And his
feet smell. Shut up! You shut up!

349
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,284
Oh you little...

350
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,915
- He's strangling his own foot.
- Shouldn't we get moving?

351
00:51:09,915 --> 00:51:14,816
- And give, Rudy a midnight snack? Not likely.
- The skulls right, take a load of mammals.

352
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:21,906
We'll camp here. Now, who's hungry?
I am. You don't need the calories!

353
00:51:25,451 --> 00:51:31,291
There I was... My back
against the wall. No way out.

354
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:40,362
Perched on a razor's edge of oblivion.
Staring into the eye, of the great white beast.

355
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:46,991
- Were you killed?
- Sadly, yes. But I lived!

356
00:52:48,555 --> 00:52:53,873
Never had I felt so alive, than
when I was so close... To death.

357
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:56,271
Just before, Rudy could
suck me down his gullet.

358
00:52:56,272 --> 00:53:01,381
I grabbed hold of that, roast pink fleshy thing
that dangles at the back of the throat.

359
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:09,410
I hung on to that sucker,
and I swung back and forth, back and forth.

360
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:18,064
Back... and forth and back. Until finally
I let go and shot right out of his mouth.

361
00:53:18,273 --> 00:53:23,069
I may have lost an eye that day.
But I got this.

362
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:26,093
Rudy's tooth...

363
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:32,871
It's like the old saying: "An eye for
a tooth". A nose for a chin. A butt for a"...

364
00:53:32,871 --> 00:53:37,458
- It's an old saying. But uh, it's not a very good one.
- You are super weasel.

365
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:41,629
- Ultra weasel.
- Diesel weasel.

366
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:47,573
What? He is.

367
00:53:47,573 --> 00:53:51,535
Now let me tell you about the time I used
to sharpen, clam-Shell to turn a T-Rex,

368
00:53:51,535 --> 00:53:54,455
- Into a T-Rachel
- Yes master.

369
00:53:54,663 --> 00:53:57,687
Wow, that's enough
fairy-Tales for one night.

370
00:53:57,688 --> 00:54:02,171
- Come on, Ellie. You should rest now...
- Pff..Life at the party.

371
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:07,697
- Alright, you guys get some shut-Eye, I'll keep watch.
- Don't worry, Buck, we got this.

372
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:13,640
- Night time is possum time.
- Yeah, we own the night baby.

373
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,385
Good night, Rudy.

374
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:43,670
Wait, wait. What about me?

375
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:05,672
Sleep well, kids. We have a busy
day tomorrow. Forging, Hunting...

376
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:11,407
Missing my friends.
Probably are not missing me.

377
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:15,994
What..?

378
00:55:24,857 --> 00:55:29,445
Your a real softie.
You know that?

379
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:53,011
Manny?

380
00:55:56,764 --> 00:56:00,518
Crash? Eddie?

381
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:05,836
Manny?

382
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:26,899
What's going on? Are you okay?

383
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:31,278
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to keep you safe, and

384
00:56:31,278 --> 00:56:34,719
Now you're in the most
dangerous place in the world.

385
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:39,933
This isn't your fault. It's bigger than
both of us. We have to get, Sid.

386
00:56:39,933 --> 00:56:46,502
Yeah, but If I had been a better friend
to him... we wouldn't be here.

387
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:49,578
Better friend?
Are you plucking my whiskers?

388
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,592
You risked your life, your mate
and your baby to save your buddy!

389
00:56:54,113 --> 00:56:58,910
Not the best husband or father,
but... a damn good friend.

390
00:58:16,696 --> 00:58:18,260
Everybody stop!

391
00:58:19,407 --> 00:58:22,744
I smell something.

392
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:29,834
Hmm, it smells like
a buzzard's butt fell off.

393
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:32,858
- And then got sprayed on by a bunch of, skunks.
- That's, Sid.

394
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:36,925
Mammal's, we have ourselves a crime scene.

395
00:58:38,906 --> 00:58:44,745
Half eaten carcass! Hunk of...oh, no!

396
00:58:45,162 --> 00:58:47,039
Broccoli!

397
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:52,461
Here's what I think happened: Dinosaur attacked Sid,
Sid, fights back with piece of broccoli.

398
00:58:52,982 --> 00:58:57,362
- Leaving dinosaur, a vegetable.
- Are you nuts?

399
00:58:57,569 --> 00:59:00,176
Sid's not violent,
or co-Ordinated.

400
00:59:00,177 --> 00:59:04,348
- Yeah and where's the dinosaur?
- Alright, alright. Good point.

401
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:05,912
Theory two:

402
00:59:06,016 --> 00:59:11,125
Sid's eating broccoli. Dinosaur eats Sid.
Dinosaur steps on broccoli.

403
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:15,713
- Leaving broccoli, a vegetable.
- Buck, when exactly did you lose your mind?

404
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:20,718
Umm... 3 months ago. I woke up
one morning married to a pineapple.

405
00:59:20,718 --> 00:59:23,846
An *UGLY* pineapple.

406
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:29,894
- But I loved her.
- Uh, Buck! I think you missed a little clue over here.

407
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:38,861
Your friend might be alive.
But not for long. Rudy's closing in.

408
00:59:38,863 --> 00:59:39,905
Wow...

409
00:59:39,487 --> 00:59:45,639
You got it. The plates of, wow.
Or whatever's left of them.

410
01:00:54,562 --> 01:00:59,567
Single file everyone.
Head for, Lava Falls.

411
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:16,251
- What's that sound?
- It's the wind. It's speaking to us.

412
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:21,047
- What's it saying?
- I don't know. I don't speak wind.

413
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:34,602
- Ellie?
- I'm fine, don't worry about me. I'm just taking my...

414
01:01:37,313 --> 01:01:39,399
Ellie! Whoa!

415
01:01:40,858 --> 01:01:45,551
- Manny!
- Get to the ledge!

416
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:04,945
- Ellie!
- Ellie, where are you?

417
01:02:04,945 --> 01:02:12,244
- It's okay, I'm up here.
- Hang on, Ellie. We'll be right there.

418
01:02:32,577 --> 01:02:35,914
Wait! Sloth down!

419
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:45,819
Wait... Time out. Hold up.
Jeez, you guys are getting fast.

420
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:53,744
It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather, friendly neighbours.

421
01:02:59,896 --> 01:03:02,711
Hi, neighbour.

422
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:08,029
- Rudy...
- Rudy!

423
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:12,304
- Never heard that kind of dino, before.
- That's, Sid. - We'll have to move fast.

424
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:17,935
- Manny. Pineapples.
- Pineapples. - She gets cravings.

425
01:03:17,935 --> 01:03:22,627
- Pomegranates, grapefruits, nectarines.
- She's ordering a fruit cocktail.

426
01:03:23,357 --> 01:03:30,969
- Come on, think. Peaches!
- Peaches...? Peaches!

427
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:38,268
- The baby! What, what, what now...!
- This not good. - The babies coming.

428
01:03:38,268 --> 01:03:44,211
- Can you try to hold it in!
- Can somebody slap him for me?

429
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:47,652
- Just sit tight, we're coming!
- There's only one thing to do.

430
01:03:47,652 --> 01:03:51,719
Possums, your with me. Manny you
take care of, Ellie until we get back.

431
01:03:51,823 --> 01:03:55,577
What? No you can't leave now.
She's off the trail. What about rule number 2?

432
01:03:55,577 --> 01:03:59,122
Rule number 5 says, you can ignore
rule number 2, if there's a female involved.

433
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:05,378
- Or possibly a cute dog. I just make up these rules as I go along.
- Yeah, but, but, but... she's... you have to.

434
01:04:05,899 --> 01:04:13,720
- Manny, it's alright. I got your back.
- Now your talking. Come on, lads.

435
01:04:16,744 --> 01:04:21,331
- Take care of our sister. Mr.
- No pressure.

436
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:24,043
What does that mean, "I've got your back?".
I'd rather they cover the front.

437
01:04:24,564 --> 01:04:28,422
- That's where all the good stuff is.
- We gotta move.

438
01:04:33,323 --> 01:04:38,432
Okay! Alright. It's okay.
Daddy's, daddy's coming.

439
01:04:38,536 --> 01:04:42,394
I gotta say sweet heart,
you really got timing...

440
01:05:02,206 --> 01:05:07,106
Go away! Go away! Shoo!
Afraid of danger! Afraid of danger!

441
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,851
Don't worry, it's just lava. Deadly,

442
01:05:22,851 --> 01:05:26,084
Violent lava!

443
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:44,227
- Boys! Are you ready for adventure?
- Yes, sir!

444
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:46,521
- For danger?
- Yes, sir!

445
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:51,422
- For death!
- Uhh, can you repeat the question? ?

446
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:04,560
That's right, come on!

447
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:12,067
- Have you ever flown one of these before?
- No, first time actually.

448
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:23,120
- There she is.
- Ellie! - Manny!

449
01:06:26,978 --> 01:06:32,296
- I need to get to her.
- Listen, I'll protect, Ellie. You stop those guys.

450
01:06:32,296 --> 01:06:37,718
Manny, if they reach her, it'll
be to late. You have to trust me.

451
01:06:40,325 --> 01:06:43,036
Alright, let's do it.

452
01:07:18,696 --> 01:07:23,284
My paws are burning baby. They
burning, I gotta, tip-Toe. Tip-Toe, Tip-Toe.

453
01:07:23,597 --> 01:07:30,375
- Excuse me, twinkle toes. Giving birth here.
- Oh right, sorry. You okay.

454
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:37,048
- Am I okay? Do you know anything about, child birth?
- No, not really, but Manny's coming..

455
01:07:43,617 --> 01:07:49,769
- Diego, I'm scared? Can I hold your paw.
- Yeah, of course...

456
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:54,983
Just go with the pain.
It's just a contraction.

457
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:13,021
- Look! He's right there. - Roger.
- No, Sid. - I know, Roger!

458
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:19,278
How bout we get, Sid first. And then
go back for, Roger. - Oh, never mind.

459
01:08:29,913 --> 01:08:32,103
Oh, Buck.

460
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:53,062
- Wait! Wait, Sid's that way!
- Tell that to them.

461
01:08:54,313 --> 01:08:56,815
Bring it on, you chicken headed freaks!

462
01:09:14,854 --> 01:09:19,338
Don't worry about a thing.
You're doing fine.

463
01:09:19,338 --> 01:09:24,134
It's going great.
Ah, excuse me.

464
01:09:26,115 --> 01:09:29,452
- Just keep breathing.
- Diego!

465
01:09:29,452 --> 01:09:32,789
Just breathe, that's the important thing.

466
01:09:40,296 --> 01:09:42,799
Grab that ammo.

467
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:48,846
- Bogey at 3'o clock.
- Fire!

468
01:09:57,397 --> 01:10:00,838
This is awesome!

469
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:05,217
Light it up!

470
01:10:05,738 --> 01:10:08,137
- Yeah!
- Hasta la vista, birdie.

471
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:22,630
Let's get our...

472
01:10:23,569 --> 01:10:29,929
Mayday! Mayday! We're
losing altitude! Hold these.

473
01:10:31,806 --> 01:10:37,437
- That tastes like fish.
- Okay. That's just weird.

474
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:40,356
- I love you, bro!
- I know!

475
01:10:40,878 --> 01:10:44,736
- Snap out of it, come on! Pull!

476
01:10:53,912 --> 01:10:58,083
- This is the end of, Sid the sloth.

477
01:11:05,486 --> 01:11:09,656
- Help!
- No, Sid. It's me. - And me!

478
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:13,827
I don't want to panic anybody,
but who's flying this thing?

479
01:11:26,653 --> 01:11:29,364
No, no, wait, my kids!

480
01:11:32,075 --> 01:11:35,620
I never even got to say goodbye.

481
01:11:38,018 --> 01:11:44,483
- You can do it. Push! Push! - I can't do it.
- Just one more big push.

482
01:11:45,003 --> 01:11:51,156
You have no idea what I'm going through.
Okay forget I said that. Let's do this together.

483
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:10,238
- I liked you guys better, when you were extinct.
- Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

484
01:12:12,323 --> 01:12:16,598
Manny. Come on buddy.
I think we're getting close.

485
01:12:51,425 --> 01:12:58,515
She's perfect.
I think we should call her, Ellie.

486
01:12:58,515 --> 01:13:04,876
- Little, Ellie...
- I've got a better name... Peaches. - Peaches?

487
01:13:04,876 --> 01:13:11,966
Why not? She's sweet, and round,
and covered with furs.

488
01:13:12,696 --> 01:13:15,199
I love it.

489
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:20,934
- I saw that, tough guy.
- No, no, that last dino caught my eye with a claw and...

490
01:13:21,038 --> 01:13:28,337
- Alright, so I'm not made of stone.
- Incoming!

491
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,422
It's Sid!

492
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,479
Oh, It's a boy!

493
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,660
- That's it's tail.
- It's a girl.

494
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:43,091
Hi, sweetheart.
It's uncle Sid... Yes it is.

495
01:13:43,614 --> 01:13:46,688
Oh, you're so beautiful.
Oh, she is...

496
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:50,651
She looks just like her mother.
Thank goodness.

497
01:13:50,755 --> 01:13:53,675
Oh, no offence, Manny, No offence.
You're beautiful on the inside.

498
01:13:54,093 --> 01:13:56,073
It's good to have you back, Sid.

499
01:13:56,177 --> 01:14:01,808
Never thought I would say
this, but... I missed you buddy.

500
01:14:04,519 --> 01:14:10,671
Now I wish my kids were here.
You could have been friends.

501
01:14:10,671 --> 01:14:12,860
Ellie!

502
01:14:15,572 --> 01:14:21,306
- I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
- I didn't.

503
01:14:24,852 --> 01:14:31,316
I forgot what it was like to be part of a family.
What about you? Ever thought about having kids?

504
01:14:34,027 --> 01:14:38,615
Alright, mammal's. Let's get you home.

505
01:16:03,701 --> 01:16:09,540
This is it, mammal's. Right where
you started. This was fun.

506
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,876
- We could make it a regular thing.
- I don't know about that.

507
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:19,237
Right, Right. Yes cos' of all
the uh, mortal peril. Of-Course.

508
01:16:19,028 --> 01:16:23,929
- Oh, well, the Buck stops here!
- We couldn't have done it without you.

509
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:28,934
Well obviously. But, good times just the same...

510
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:32,688
We're not alone, are we?

511
01:16:35,816 --> 01:16:38,214
Hello, Rudy.

512
01:16:46,243 --> 01:16:48,746
Run!

513
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:59,590
Over here you colossal, fossil!
Looking for something?

514
01:17:01,258 --> 01:17:06,680
Why don't you come and
get it? To the cave! Go!

515
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:12,415
- Stay with the baby.
- We'll be fine. Go!

516
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:20,652
Wuss!

517
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:34,520
Pop, Goes the weasel!

518
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:49,118
Shoo, shoo! Come on! Move!

519
01:17:50,474 --> 01:17:53,498
Diego... Catch!

520
01:18:03,716 --> 01:18:08,826
Through the hole, over the
valley. One more loop. - Come on lads, heev!

521
01:18:23,841 --> 01:18:28,011
Better luck next time, snowflake. This isn't
Gonna hold him long. Let's go.

522
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,723
Hold up, guys!

523
01:18:52,411 --> 01:18:55,018
Way to go, mom-Zilla!

524
01:19:26,403 --> 01:19:31,095
Come here, kids. Well let me tell you something.
You're where you belong now.

525
01:19:31,095 --> 01:19:36,517
And I'm sure you're gonna grow
up to be giant, horrifying dinosaurs.

526
01:19:36,517 --> 01:19:39,020
Just like your mother.

527
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:43,191
Momma...

528
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:46,840
...take good care of our kids.

529
01:20:13,429 --> 01:20:17,600
- You were a good parent, Sid.
- Thank's.

530
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,164
- Can I baby-Sit for you.
- Not a chance.

531
01:20:19,686 --> 01:20:23,439
- Oh come on, I work cheap.
- Alright, I'll think about it.

532
01:20:23,961 --> 01:20:27,923
- Yes!
- Never happened.

533
01:20:30,947 --> 01:20:35,743
- He's gone. What am I supposed to do now?
- That's easy.

534
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:41,583
- Come with us.
- You mean... up there?

535
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:47,943
I never thought of going back. I've
been down here so long, it feels like up to me.

536
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:56,076
- I'm not sure I can fit-In up there anymore.
- So look at us. We look like a normal herd to you?

537
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:25,898
So long, big guy.

538
01:21:36,846 --> 01:21:40,183
That's our queue. Come on peaches.

539
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,790
He's alive.

540
01:21:43,728 --> 01:21:46,022
Buck...?

541
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:50,297
- I... I gotta...
- Yeah...

542
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:55,823
Besides this world should
really stay down here.

543
01:21:56,241 --> 01:22:01,350
- Take care of 'em, tiger.
- "Always listen to, Buck."

544
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,852
We're almost out.

545
01:22:33,152 --> 01:22:38,157
- Is everybody, okay?
- Where's Buck?

546
01:22:39,409 --> 01:22:43,997
Don't worry.
He's where he wants to be.

547
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:48,480
- Is he going to be okay?
- Are you kidding? Nothing can kill that weasel.

548
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,817
It's, Rudy I'm worried about.

549
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:08,813
I know this baby thing isn't for you.
But whatever you decide to do...

550
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:13,505
I'm not leaving, buddy.
Life of adventure... It's right here.

551
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:19,553
Well, I got a whole speech here. I've been
working on it. How can I show you that I'm strong and...

552
01:23:19,553 --> 01:23:23,515
Sensitive? Noble, yet caring?

553
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:26,539
Thank's.

554
01:23:40,303 --> 01:23:44,370
Ah, they grow so fast, huh?
Look at my kids.

555
01:23:44,578 --> 01:23:51,877
- Seems they were born one day and then gone the next.
- They were, Sid. - Yeah, it was a lot of work.

556
01:24:03,243 --> 01:24:07,830
It's right, sweetheart.
Welcome to the Ice Age.
