2
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,950
It's happening!

3
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,690
Wait up guys!

4
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,550
The baby is coming! The baby
is coming! I'm having a baby.

5
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,260
- Code blue code blue.
- Or pink if it's a girl

6
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,960
Coming up baby! Coming up baby!
I'm coming Ellie!

7
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,250
We got it.

8
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,230
- Ellie Ellie! Where are you? Where am I?
- Manny!

9
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,340
I told you! It was just a kick.

10
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,310
Oh... right! Right... Oh wow!

11
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,210
Oh you really gave daddy a scare!
Daddy got silly.

12
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,600
Daddy fall down cliff and go
boom boom boom. Silly daddy!

13
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,850
Sorry folks. False alarm.
It was just a kick.

14
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,220
- Do you know who I want to kick?
- That's the third false alarm this week.

15
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,980
Allright show's over...
break it up break it up!

16
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,830
Oh I see someone else
who has a bun in the oven?

17
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,340
I'm not pregnant!

18
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,780
Too bad.
You'd make a wonderful mother.

19
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,530
Manny I know you're excited.
I am too.

20
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,030
But you're getting a
little carried away.

21
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,190
Okay okay...

22
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,560
Boy you're starting
to sound like Diego.

23
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,460
Wait a second... Where is Diego?

24
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,080
My hooves are burning baby!
They are burning!

25
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,400
Oh look at this! I got to tiptoe!
I got to tiptoe! Eat my dust dingo!

26
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,010
- Huh can I look now?
- Easy don't freak out the baby.

27
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,080
The baby is fine. It's the freaked
out daddy I'm worried about.

28
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,270
Ah uh uh! No peeking.

29
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,310
- Voila! Playground for junior...
- Oh wow!

30
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,990
It's amazing.

31
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:58,050
- Oh Manny...
- I made it myself. Our family.

32
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,460
Hey why aren't I up there?

33
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,900
- You can be on ours.
- You'd fit right in.

34
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,360
Of course it's still work in progress.
Few rough edges here and there.

35
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,350
I don't believe it!
You're trying to baby proof nature.

36
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,720
Baby proof nature?
Get outta here.

37
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,690
That's ridiculous.

38
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,580
Manny this is the world our baby's
gonna grow up in. You can't change that.

39
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,450
Of course I can I'm the
biggest thing on earth.

40
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,710
Okay big daddy I can't wait to see
how you handle the teen years.

41
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,540
Come on Sid. I don't want you
touching anything. This place is for kids.

42
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:53,110
Are you a kid?
Don't answer that.

43
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,080
Diego there you are.
You missed the big surprise.

44
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,220
- I'll check it out later.
- Okay. See ya!

45
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,030
You know I think there's
something bothering Diego.

46
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,420
No I'm sure everything's fine.

47
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
You should talk to him.

48
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,910
Guys don't talk to guys
about guy problems.

49
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,190
- We just punch each other on the shoulders.
- That's stupid!

50
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,440
To a girl but for a guy that's
like six months of therapy.

51
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,340
Okay Okay I'm going.

52
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,140
- Hey!
- Oww!

53
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,600
- Why'd you do that?
- I don't know.

54
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,820
So listen! Ellie thinks theres
something bothering you...

55
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,910
Actually I've been thinking that soon
it might be time for me to head out.

56
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,250
Okay. So I'll just tell her that
you're fine. It was nothing.

57
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,440
Look who are we kidding Manny?
I'm losing my edge.

58
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,590
I'm not really built for
chaperoning playdates.

59
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,070
What do you talking about?

60
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,070
Having a family that's huge.
And I'm happy for you but...

61
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,970
- It's your adventure not mine.
- So you don't want to be around my kid?

62
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,100
No no no... That's...
You're taking this the wrong way.

63
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,820
No go! Go find some adventure
Mr. adventure guy!

64
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,440
Don't let my boring domestic life
hit you on the bottom on your way out.

65
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,610
Isn't Ellie supposed to be the one
with the hormonal imbalance?

66
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,640
Manny wait! No one has to leave.

67
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,700
- So?
- That's why guys don't talk to guys.

68
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,230
- Why? What happened?
- Diego's leaving.

69
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,540
Whoa whoa! This should be the best
time of our lives. We're having a baby.

70
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:00,430
- No Sid. They're havin' a baby
- Yeah but we're a herd. We're a family

71
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,850
Look things have changed.
Manny has other priority's now.

72
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,210
Face it Sid. We had a great run
but... now it's time to move on.

73
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:18,150
- So it's just the two of us.
- No Sid. It's not the two of us.

74
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,910
Crash and Eddie are coming with us?

75
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,700
Just Crash?
Just Eddie?

76
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,120
Goodbye Sid!

77
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,140
Okay calm down. Calm down.
I'm good at making friends.

78
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,100
I'll make my own herd.
That's what I'll do!

79
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,530
Hey! "Me amigo's. Que pasa?"

80
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,850
Well at least you still got your looks.

81
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,570
Oh great!

82
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,480
Anybody here?

83
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,480
Hello?

84
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,260
Oh poor guys! I know what
it's like to feel abandoned.

85
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,580
Don't worry
you're not alone anymore.

86
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,220
There you go.

87
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,710
Stay here! You take care
of your brother now.

88
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,740
Momma's coming right back.

89
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,330
Momma's coming baby!

90
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,210
I got you.

91
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,940
What did I just tell you kids?

92
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,930
Oh thank you
thank you thank you!

93
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,620
Bad eggs rotten eggs!
A heart attack you almost gave me.

94
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:40,610
Oh I'm sorry darling!
It's just that I love you so much.

95
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,900
Hello!

96
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,540
I'd like to present Eggbert
Shelly and Yoko.

97
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,660
Sid whatever you're doing.
It's a bad idea!

98
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,640
Shh! My kids will hear you.

99
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,770
They're not your kids Sid.
Take them back.

100
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,220
- You're not meant to be a parent.
- Why not?

101
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,630
First sign: stealing
someone else's eggs.

102
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,430
Second sign: one of them
almost became an omelet.

103
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,760
Sid someone must be
worried sick looking for them.

104
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,470
No they were underground in ice.

105
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,860
If it wasn't for me they'd be...
Egg sickles.

106
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,380
Sid I know what you're going through.
You're gonna have a family too someday.

107
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,890
You gonna meet a nice girl with... with low
standards no real options or sense of smell...

108
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,480
- What Manny means to say is...
- No I get it. I'll take them back.

109
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,110
You have your family and I'm
better off alone. By myself.

110
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,590
A fortress of solitude.

111
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,260
In the ice for ever!

112
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,850
Alone lonely loner..

113
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,710
- That's a lot of aloners.
- Precisely!

114
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,090
- Sid wait.
- No no it's ok.

115
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,730
He'll bounce back it's one of
the advantages of being Sid.

116
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,500
Why should I take you back.
I love kids.

117
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:22,070
I'm responsible loving nurturing.
What do you think?

118
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,800
I knew you would agree.

119
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:35,420
Oh oh don't cry!
I'll find a dry place.

120
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,860
Let me just dry you off.

121
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,740
I don't know being
a parents a lot of work.

122
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,180
Maybe I'm not ready.

123
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,220
Mamma mama mama!

124
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,690
I'm a mommy.

125
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,030
Where's mommy?

126
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,300
Here I am!

127
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,680
There you go nice clean faces.

128
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,660
I got it! I got it!

129
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,850
Stop it no.

130
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,170
Hey no biting!

131
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,160
I'm sorry no it's okay it's okay.
Don't cry! Why you still crying?

132
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:38,200
Are you hungry? Maybe you're hungry.
I know just the thing.

133
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:49,780
...this is animal
I am your baby and this is my milk

134
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,140
Ahhhh!
I thought you were a female!

135
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,130
I'm sorry but you can't go in.
Manny says It's just for kids.

136
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,450
Wait a minute...
You are kids!

137
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,640
Just don't break anything!

138
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,250
- The Sloth says the playground's open!
- No wait. Not for everyone!

139
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,590
No no. Don't touch that!

140
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,450
- What are they?
- Who cares? Their fun!

141
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,960
Mommy his not sharing.

142
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,870
- Aren't you gonna do something.
- Why my kid had it first.

143
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:09,680
- Did not!
- Did to!

144
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,260
- What is the matter with you?
- I'm a single mother with 3 kids.

145
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,700
I could use a little compassion.

146
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,650
- No don't!
- No don't! Stop!

147
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,110
- Ronald!
- Whoa! That's insane.

148
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,640
Stop! Stop! Stop!

149
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:43,290
- Hold on little Johnny!
- I'm trying!

150
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,820
You know experts say that you should
let the kids eat whatever they want.

151
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,590
- Do you think my ankles look fat?
- Ankles. What ankles?

152
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,540
Ronald where did you come from?

153
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,460
Oh no!

154
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,260
Okay come on! Spit him out!
If you don't spit out little Johnny

155
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,320
we're leaving the playground
this instantly... One...

156
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,220
Two... Don't make me say "three".

157
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,650
- There we are! A picture of health.
- That's not little Johnny.

158
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,820
- Well better than nothing.
- Madison!

159
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,570
- Come on barf him up!
- Sid!

160
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:37,200
- Hello Manny!
- Little Johnny!

161
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,250
Oh wait... No! No!

162
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,690
Oh I'm really sorry.

163
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,470
This place is totalled.

164
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,160
- And we didn't reck it.
- We're losing our touch bro!

165
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,690
The important thing is that no
one got hurt. Except for that guy.

166
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,860
And and those three... and her.

167
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,390
I told you to take them back and
you kept them! Now look what they've done.

168
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,930
Okay granted we do have
some discipline issues.

169
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,430
Eating kids is not
a discipline issue.

170
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,340
- But he spit them out!
- Well that's super! Lets give him a gold star!

171
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,960
They don't belong here Sid.

172
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,740
Whatever they are wherever
you found them take them back.

173
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,800
Manny I'm not getting rid of my kids!

174
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,030
Earthquake!

175
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,520
It's Okay It's okay mamma's here!

176
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,630
Do earthquakes shriek?

177
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,580
- I thought those guys were extinct.
- Well then that is one angry fossil. Sid!

178
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,750
Come on inside inside inside.

179
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,040
Nobody move a muscle!

180
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,930
No no no don't cry.

181
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,870
We are poor little lambs
who have lost our way.

182
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,100
Baah baaah!
Ahhhh!

183
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:43,020
- Sid! Give them to her. She's their mother.
- How do I know she's their mother?

184
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,930
What do you want a birth
certificate? She's a Dinosaur!

185
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,730
Well I've put in the blood
sweat and tears to raise them.

186
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:56,780
- For a day! Give them back you lunatic!
- Look these are my kids!

187
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,510
And you're gonna have to go
through me to get them!

188
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,650
- Sid!
- Help!

189
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:22,120
- Run!
- Don't you have anything better to do?

190
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,640
- Help!
- Sid?

191
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,940
- Sid must be down there.
- Well his dead! Real shame.

192
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,800
- He will be missed.
- Oh no no no! Not so fast!

193
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,520
Okay. Ellie this is where I draw the line.
You Crash and Eddie back to the village.

194
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,440
Yeah that's gonna happen.

195
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,200
Ellie! You saw that thing?
This is gonna be dangerous.

196
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,770
Talk to the trunk.

197
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,350
Oh great! After we save Sid
I'm gonna kill him.

198
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,120
- Ladies first!
- Age before beauty!

199
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,130
- No pain no gain!
- What pain?

200
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,370
- Sid?
- Sid?

201
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,810
Oh no no no! Not good. Not good.

202
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,980
Ellie! Ellie! Wait up!

203
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,030
Okay look if you feel anything
even if it's nothing...

204
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,530
...you gotta tell me.
And we're outta here.

205
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,260
We need a code word.
Yeah something that says "the baby's coming. "

206
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,750
Hmm. How about "Aaah! The
baby's coming!" How's that?

207
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:13,380
Nah too long. We need something
short and punchy like uh... "peaches"!

208
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,790
Peaches?

209
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,690
I love peaches they're
sweet and round and fuzzy.

210
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,620
- Just like you.
- You think I'm round?

211
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,600
Uh... Round is good.
Round is foxy!

212
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,740
Stay close.

213
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,240
- Are you guys havin' the same dream I am?
- We've been living above an entire world.

214
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,730
And we didn't even know it.

215
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,230
Run for it! Hurry.

216
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:46,560
- Diego what are you doing here?
- Sight seeing. Looking for Sid same as you!

217
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,060
Well aren't you noble.

218
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,440
This is not the time guys.
We need all the help we can get!

219
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,780
Never mind!

220
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:19,410
Here boy. Here come on!

221
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,860
Are you nuts! We're
not getting on that thing!

222
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,490
It's either this
dinosaur or that one!

223
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:33,940
Pregnant lady wants a lift.
Yabba dabba Do!

224
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,760
Don't ever yabba dabba do that again!

225
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,710
- I feel so... puny.
- How do you think I feel?

226
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,790
Ouch!

227
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,780
Take cover!

228
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:15,810
Dude you're awesome!
You're like the brother I never had! Me too.

229
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,830
Can we keep him?

230
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,040
- Buck.
- What?

231
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,770
The name's Buck.
Short for Buckminster.

232
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,530
Long for "Buh!".

233
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,910
A little dull.

234
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,660
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.

235
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:54,600
Well his dead. Welcome to my world.
Now uh go home.

236
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,390
- Off you pop!
- Not without Sid.

237
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:00,030
Ellie wait maybe the
deranged hermit has a point.

238
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,820
Manny! We came this
far we're gonna find him.

239
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,280
I got tracks.

240
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,030
Let's go.

241
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,390
If you go in there you'll find
your friend... in the AFTER-LIFE!

242
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:21,090
How do you know oh great
and wisely weasely one?

243
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,820
Mummy dinosaur carrying three babies
and... some floppy green thing?

244
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,290
Yeah we're friends with
the floppy green thing.

245
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,920
You got all that from the tracks?

246
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,720
No not really. I saw 'em come through
here earlier. She's headed for Lava Falls.

247
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,640
That's where they care for the newborns.

248
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,850
To get there! You got to go
through the jungle of misery.

249
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:55,810
Across the chasm of death.

250
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,130
- To the plates of wow.
- Wow!

251
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,550
Okay! Good luck with the slow decadence
to madness we're gonna go now.

252
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,510
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

253
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,800
What you... You think this is
some sort of tropical getaway?

254
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,880
You can't protect your mate mate!

255
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,260
What are you gonna do with
those... those flimsy tusks?

256
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,860
When you run into the Beast?

257
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,720
I call him "Rudy".

258
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:34,710
Oh good. Good. I was worried it was
something intimidating like Sheldon or Tim.

259
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,040
Wait! You mean there's something
bigger than Mommy Dinosaur?

260
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,190
Aye!

261
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,590
- Aye?
- Aye! Aye!

262
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,110
- He's the one that gave me this.
- Whoa! He gave you that patch?

263
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:52,540
- For free? That's so cool.
- Yeah maybe he'll give us one too!

264
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,880
Welcome to my world!

265
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:06,350
- Abandon all hope he who enters there!
- Alright we get it.

266
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,890
Doom and despair.
Yadda yadda yadda!

267
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:28,890
Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.

268
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,530
- Hold on.
- Why? What's wrong? Peaches?

269
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:50,050
- No it's just I got a funny feeling.
- You're hungry low blood sugar!

270
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,270
- There's some fruit.
- No Manny!

271
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,860
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

272
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,550
This isn't exactly your playground.

273
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,840
Like I'm going to be afraid
of a pretty flower.

274
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,400
- Bet you didn't see that coming?
- Manny?

275
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,680
For the record I blame you for this.

276
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,160
Stop eating our friends plant!

277
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:27,170
- That's it I'm tearing it up from the roots.
- Do that and it'll clamp-shut forever.

278
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,900
Alright preggers.
Don't get your trunk in a knot.

279
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,160
I'll have them out of
there before they're digested.

280
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,640
Digested?

281
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,570
They'll be nothing
but bones in 3 minutes.

282
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,370
- Well maybe 5 for the fat one.
- I'm not fat!

283
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,600
I feel tingly.

284
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,750
Don't say that when you're
pressed up against me.

285
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:49,800
- Not that kind of tingly.
- I can feel it too.

286
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,680
- Help someone help us!
- Hurry!

287
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,520
It's time to get... Buck wild.

288
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,510
Who's fat now?

289
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,120
No!

290
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,060
- Tourists.
- Puked on by a plant. Awesome!

291
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:24,480
- Say something.
- Thanks for saving us.

292
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,240
Will you help us find
the floppy green thing?

293
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,530
- That's not necessary.
- Yes it is.

294
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,830
Alright I'll help ya. But I got rules.
Rule number one:

295
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,790
Always listen to Buck.
Rule number two:

296
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,530
Stay in the middle of the trail.
Rule number three:

297
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,450
He who has gas travels
at the back of the pack.

298
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,810
- Come on then! Chop chop!
- We should all have our heads examined.

299
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:08,170
That's rule number four.
Now let's go find your friend.

300
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,800
Oh it's okay it's okay.
Don't worry we're gonna be fine.

301
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,490
Please swing a little more to...

302
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,040
See she's putting us down...

303
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,530
No! I'm too young to be eaten.

304
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:55,510
Wow! Nice mucus. And I
don't care for everyone.

305
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,870
Listen these things get complicated.
Maybe we can work something out.

306
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:17,510
I can have them on Sundays to Tuesdays?
Wednesdays to Fridays? Weekends!

307
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,630
It's okay mommas okay!

308
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:35,340
If you eat me it will send a bad message.

309
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,330
Ha! Score one for the sloth!

310
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,940
And the scores all tied up.

311
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:59,430
- Do you think the beast will find Sid?
- Or more importantly us?

312
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:05,790
Rudy? Are you joking? He's relentless.
He knows all sees all eats all.

313
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,440
So that's a "yes".

314
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,640
Hey get off my lawn! Go on shoo!

315
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,820
I knew that guy when he was a caterpillar.
You know before he came out.

316
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,820
So you're just living down here by your wits!
All on your own no responsibilities?

317
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,500
Not one! It's incredible.

318
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,430
No dependence no limits
the greatest life a single guy can have.

319
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,420
Did you hear that?
This is my kind of place.

320
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:47,610
Hello? No no. I can't really talk right now.
I'm trying to recover a dead sloth.

321
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,560
Now they're following me!
I know they think I'm crazy.

322
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:59,810
Okay... We're going into the Chasm of Death
I'm gonna lose you. I love you too.

323
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,290
- Alright. Goodbye goodbye bye.
- Okay follow me!

324
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,880
That's you in three weeks.

325
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:30,570
- So why do they call it the chasm of death?
- Well we tried 'big smelly crack'.

326
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,260
- But that just made everybody giggle.
- Well now what?

327
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,290
- Madam...
- She is not doing that.

328
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,000
Rule number one.

329
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,050
Come on mammoth.
You supposed to have a good memory.

330
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,860
Always listen to Buck.

331
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,060
Now! Eyes forward!
Back straight... and... uh yes...

332
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,170
Breathe in the toxic fumes
and you'll probably die.

333
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,230
Toxic fumes.

334
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:11,230
- Just another day in paradise.
- Wait!

335
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,420
Geronimo!

336
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,930
- Ellie! You okay?
- You have to try this.

337
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:30,420
Alright now pile on
everyone couldn't be easier.

338
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:42,510
Don't panic! Just some technical
difficulties. Keep holding it in boys.

339
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:52,530
- I can't take it anymore.
- He breathe it. And now I'm breathing it.

340
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,780
- Hey we're not dead.
- You sound ridiculous.

341
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,530
Me? You should hear you.

342
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,400
Alright alright.
And one and two...

343
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,440
- Christmas Christmas time is here...
- Are you crazy?

344
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,720
It's not poison.

345
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,750
It's so disturbing.

346
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:32,360
- Stop laughing all of you!
- "Stop laughing all of you!"

347
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,880
What's rule number one?

348
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,740
They're just laughing
what's so bad about that?

349
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,390
They died laughing.

350
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:52,640
- Stop laughing!
- Do you know what's funny though?

351
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,590
We're trying to save Sid
and now we're all gonna die!

352
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:03,220
- And I don't even like Sid.
- Who does? He's an idiot!

353
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,330
Thanks for getting me into this mess.
It's the most fun I've had in years.

354
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:14,380
Thank you for deserting the herd.
That was totally super.

355
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:25,540
Stop that! Don't you see?
We're all gonna die.

356
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:32,110
We gotta do everything huh?

357
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:46,180
- Sometimes I wet my bed.
- That's alright. Sometimes I wet your bed.

358
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,680
I'm not sure how much
of that you could hear?

359
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,760
Oh I heard all of it.

360
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,450
- You wet my bed?
- That was gas talk dude.

361
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,770
- Well we better get moving.
- Aren't we forgetting something?

362
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,470
I'm so lonely.

363
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,200
Okay. Here you go guys...
Muncher muncher.

364
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,710
What? You're not gonna
eat your vegetables?

365
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,710
How you going to become
big and strong dinosaurs?

366
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,640
No... I raised them vegetarian.

367
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,390
It's a healthier lifestyle.
I mean look at me.

368
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:10,120
Excuse me. I'm trying to
have a conversation here.

369
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,970
No no no! That's not for us kids.
Way to feathery and fleshy and...

370
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,200
...and alive!

371
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:35,980
No no no!
We do not eat live animals period.

372
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,150
Now go fly. Be free.

373
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,780
Little flightless bird.

374
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,370
My bad.

375
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,960
Hey where you going?

376
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,920
This is how you resolve a conflict?

377
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,840
No wonder you're single.

378
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,160
Oh come on!
Am I talking to myself here?

379
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,660
I say they're vegetarian.
You say "Grrr".

380
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,130
I say "Can we talk about this?".
You say "Grrr".

381
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,870
- I don't call that communication.
- Grrr!

382
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,000
See? That's your answer to everything.

383
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,300
Grrr!

384
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,310
What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on Earth.

385
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,690
Aren't you?

386
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,890
- They'll never survive. It's dangerous by day.
- But it's even worse at night.

387
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,870
- Plus the guide is a lunatic!
- What? You mean Buck? Oh he's whacko.

388
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,230
I am not.

389
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,390
- Totally bonkers!
- And his feet smell.

390
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,800
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

391
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,100
Oh you little...

392
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,690
- He's strangling his own foot.
- Shouldn't we get moving?

393
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,630
- And give Rudy a midnight snack? Not likely.
- The skulls right take a load of mammals.

394
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:21,720
We'll camp here. Now who's hungry?
I am. You don't need the calories!

395
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:31,100
There I was... My back
against the wall. No way out.

396
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:40,170
Perched on a razor's edge of oblivion.
Staring into the eye of the great white beast.

397
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:46,800
- Were you killed?
- Sadly yes. But I lived.

398
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:53,690
Never had I felt so alive than
when I was so close... To death.

399
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,080
Just before Rudy could
suck me down his gullet.

400
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,190
I grabbed hold of that roast pink fleshy thing
that dangles at the back of the throat.

401
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:09,190
I hung on to that sucker
and I swung back and forth back and forth.

402
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:17,880
Back... and forth and back. Until finally
I let go and shot right out of his mouth.

403
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:22,880
I may have lost an eye that day.
But I got this.

404
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,870
Rudy's tooth...

405
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:31,590
It's like the old saying: "An eye for
a tooth". A nose for a chin. A butt for a"...

406
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,860
It's an old saying. But
uh it's not a very good one.

407
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,270
You are super-weasel.

408
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,440
- Ultra-weasel.
- Diesel-weasel.

409
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,350
What? He is.

410
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,350
Now let me tell you about the time I used
to sharpen clam-shell to turn a T-Rex.

411
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,270
- Into a T-Rachel
- Yes master.

412
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,500
Wow that's enough
fairy-tales for one night.

413
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,980
- Come on Ellie. You should rest now...
- Pff.. Life at the party.

414
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,340
Alright you guys get some
shut-eye I'll keep watch.

415
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,510
Don't worry Buck we got this.

416
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:13,460
- Night time is possum time.
- Yeah we own the night baby.

417
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,200
Good night Rudy.

418
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,490
Wait wait. What about me?

419
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:05,490
Sleep well kids. We have a busy
day tomorrow. Forging Hunting...

420
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:11,220
Missing my friends.
Probably are not missing me.

421
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,810
What...

422
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:29,260
You're a real softie you know that?

423
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,830
Manny?

424
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,330
Crash? Eddie?

425
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,650
Manny?

426
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,720
What's going on? Are you okay?

427
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,060
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to keep you safe and

428
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,500
Now you're in the most
dangerous place in the world.

429
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:40,430
This isn't your fault. It's bigger than
both of us. We have to get Sid.

430
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:46,320
Yeah but If I had been a better friend
to him... we wouldn't be here.

431
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,420
Better friend?
Are you plucking my whiskers?

432
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:53,410
You risked your life your mate
and your baby to save your buddy!

433
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:58,730
Not the best husband or father
but... a damn good friend.

434
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,080
Everybody stop!

435
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,560
I smell something.

436
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:29,650
Hmm it smells like
a buzzard's butt fell off.

437
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,680
- And then got sprayed on by a bunch of skunks.
- That's Sid.

438
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,750
Mammal's we have ourselves a crime scene.

439
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:44,570
Half eaten carcass! Hunk of... Oh no!

440
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,860
Broccoli!

441
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,300
Here's what I think happened:

442
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,280
Dinosaur attacked Sid Sid fights back
with piece of broccoli.

443
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,180
- Leaving dinosaur a vegetable.
- Are you nuts?

444
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:00,000
Sid's not violent
or co-ordinated.

445
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,170
- Yeah and where's the dinosaur?
- Alright alright. Good point.

446
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,730
Theory two:

447
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,910
Sid's eating broccoli. Dinosaur eats Sid.
Dinosaur steps on broccoli.

448
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:15,530
- Leaving broccoli a vegetable.
- Buck when exactly did you lose your mind?

449
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,540
Umm... 3 months ago. I woke up
one morning married to a pineapple.

450
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,670
An ugly pineapple.

451
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,490
But I loved her.

452
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:29,720
Uh Buck! I think you
missed a little clue over here.

453
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:38,690
Your friend might be alive.
But not for long. Rudy's closing in.

454
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:39,790
Wow...

455
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:45,460
You got it. The plates of wow.
Or whatever's left of them.

456
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:59,390
Single file everyone.
Head for Lava Falls.

457
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:16,130
- What's that sound?
- It's the wind. It's speaking to us.

458
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,870
- What's it saying?
- I don't know. I don't speak "wind".

459
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,280
Ellie?

460
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,430
I'm fine don't worry about me.
I'm just taking my...

461
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,220
Ellie! Whoa!

462
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:45,380
- Manny!
- Get to the ledge!

463
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:04,740
- Ellie!
- Ellie where are you?

464
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:12,070
- It's okay I'm up here.
- Hang on Ellie. We'll be right there.

465
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,740
Wait! Sloth down!

466
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:45,650
Wait... Time out. Hold up.
Jeez you guys are getting fast.

467
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:53,570
It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather friendly neighbours.

468
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,540
Hi neighbour!

469
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,860
- Rudy...
- Rudy!

470
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,570
- Never heard that kind of dino before.
- That's Sid.

471
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,130
We'll have to move fast.

472
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,740
Manny pineapples!

473
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,720
- Pineapples?
- She gets cravings.

474
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,450
- Pomegranates grapefruits nectarines.
- She's ordering a fruit cocktail.

475
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:30,760
- Come on think. Peaches!
- Peaches? Peaches!

476
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,550
The baby!
What what what now!

477
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:38,100
- This not good.
- The baby is coming!

478
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:42,810
- Can you try to hold it in!
- Can somebody slap him for me?

479
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,450
- Just sit tight we're coming!
- There's only one thing to do.

480
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,080
Opossums you're with me.

481
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:51,510
Manny you take care of Ellie
until we get back.

482
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:54,320
What? No you can't leave now.
She's off the trail.

483
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,250
What about rule number 2?

484
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,950
Rule number 5 says you can ignore
rule number 2 if there's a female involved.

485
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:03,750
Or possibly a cute dog. I just
make up these rules as I go along.

486
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,210
Yeah but but but...
She's... You have to!

487
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:13,550
- Manny it's alright. I got your back.
- Now you're talking. Come on lads!

488
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:21,120
- Take care of our sister Mr.
- No pressure.

489
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,870
What does that mean "I've got your back"?
I'd rather they cover the front.

490
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,640
That's where all the
good stuff is isn't it?

491
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,250
We gotta move!

492
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:38,260
Okay! Alright. It's okay.
Daddy's daddy's coming.

493
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:42,220
I gotta say sweet heart
you really got timing...

494
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,940
Go away! Go away! Shoo!
Afraid of danger! Afraid of danger!

495
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:22,680
Don't worry it's just lava. Deadly

496
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,910
Violent lava!

497
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,060
- Boys are you ready for adventure?
- Yes sir!

498
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,350
- For danger?
- Yes sir!

499
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:51,250
- For death!
- Uh can you repeat the question?

500
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,390
That's right. Come on!

501
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:11,900
- Have you ever flown one of these before?
- No first time actually.

502
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:20,970
There she is.

503
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,950
- Ellie!
- Manny!

504
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,840
I need to get to her.

505
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:32,130
Listen I'll protect Ellie.
You stop those guys.

506
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,550
Manny if they reach her it'll
be to late. You have to trust me.

507
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,870
Alright let's do it.

508
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:21,030
My paws are burning baby!
They burning!

509
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,120
I gotta tiptoe tiptoe tiptoe...

510
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:30,170
- Excuse me twinkle toes. Giving birth here.
- Oh right. Sorry! You're okay?

511
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:33,540
Am I okay? Do you know
anything about child birth?

512
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,880
No not really but Manny's coming..

513
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:49,600
- Diego I'm scared! Can I hold your paw?
- Yeah of course...

514
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:54,820
Just go with the pain.
It's just a contraction.

515
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,970
- Look! He's right there.
- Roger!

516
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,820
- No Sid.
- I know. Roger!

517
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:16,720
How about we get Sid first
and then go back for Roger.

518
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,110
Oh never mind.

519
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,940
Oh Buck.

520
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:52,900
- Wait wait! Sid's that way!
- Tell that to them.

521
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:56,650
Bring it on you chicken headed freaks!

522
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:19,170
Don't worry about a thing.
You're doing fine.

523
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:23,970
It's going great.
Ah excuse me.

524
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:29,250
- Just keep breathing.
- Diego!

525
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,630
Just breathe that's the important thing.

526
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,630
Grab that ammo.

527
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:48,680
- Bogey at 3 o'clock.
- Fire!

528
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,680
This is awesome!

529
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,050
Light it up!

530
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:07,980
- Yeah!
- Hasta la vista birdie!

531
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,470
Let's get our...

532
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:29,770
Mayday! Mayday!
We're losing altitude! Hold these.

533
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:37,270
- That tastes like fish.
- Okay. That's just weird.

534
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:40,190
- I love you bro!
- I know!

535
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,790
Snap out of it come on! Pull!

536
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:58,130
This is the end of Sid the sloth.

537
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,510
- Help!
- No Sid. It's me.

538
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,700
- And me!
- And me!

539
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:13,670
I don't want to panic anybody
but who's flying this thing?

540
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:29,200
No no wait my kids!

541
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:35,460
I never even got to say goodbye.

542
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:42,710
- You can do it. Push! Push!
- I can't do it.

543
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:44,320
Just one more big push.

544
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:51,000
You have no idea what I'm going through.
Okay forget I said that. Let's do this together.

545
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:06,170
I liked you guys better
when you were extinct.

546
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:10,080
Oh I'm getting dizzy.

547
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:16,440
Manny. Come on buddy.
I think we're getting close.

548
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:58,320
She's perfect.
I think we should call her Ellie.

549
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:03,130
- Little Ellie...
- I've got a better name... Peaches.

550
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,720
Peaches?

551
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:11,810
Why not? She's sweet and round
and covered with furs.

552
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:15,040
I love it.

553
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,710
I saw that tough guy.

554
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,780
No no that last dino
caught my eye with a claw and...

555
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:28,180
- Alright so I'm not made of stone.
- Incoming!

556
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,260
It's Sid!

557
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,320
Oh it's a boy!

558
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,500
- That's its tail.
- It's a girl.

559
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,930
Hi sweetheart!
It's uncle Sid... Yes it is.

560
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,530
Oh you're so beautiful.
Oh she is...

561
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:50,490
She looks just like her mother.
Thank goodness!

562
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,520
Oh no offence Manny. No offence.
You're beautiful on the inside.

563
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,920
It's good to have you back Sid.

564
01:13:56,020 --> 01:14:01,650
Never thought I would say
this but... I missed you buddy.

565
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:10,520
Now I wish my kids were here.
You could have been friends.

566
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,700
Ellie!

567
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:21,150
- I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
- I didn't.

568
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,280
I forgot what it was like
to be part of a family.

569
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,160
What about you? Ever
thought about having kids?

570
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:38,460
Alright mammal's. Let's get you home.

571
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:08,130
This is it mammal's. Right where
you started. This was fun.

572
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:12,720
- We could make it a regular thing.
- I don't know about that.

573
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:18,840
Right Right. Yes cos' of all
the uh mortal peril. Of-Course.

574
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:23,770
- Oh well the Buck stops here!
- We couldn't have done it without you.

575
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,780
Well obviously. But good
times just the same...

576
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,530
We're not alone are we?

577
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:38,060
Hello Rudy!

578
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:48,590
Run!

579
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:59,440
Over here you colossal fossil!
Looking for something?

580
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:06,530
Why don't you come and
get it? To the cave! Go!

581
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:12,260
- Stay with the baby.
- We'll be fine. Go!

582
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:20,500
Wuss!

583
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,370
Pop goes the weasel!

584
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:48,970
Shoo shoo! Come on! Move!

585
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,340
Diego... Catch!

586
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,680
Through the hole over the valley.
One more loop...

587
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:09,930
Come on lads! Heev!

588
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:27,860
Better luck next time snowflake.
This isn't gonna hold him long. Let's go!

589
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,570
Hold up guys!

590
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,870
Way to go Mom-Zilla!

591
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:30,940
Come here kids. Well let me tell you
something. You're where you belong now.

592
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:36,370
And I'm sure you're gonna grow
up to be giant horrifying dinosaurs.

593
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,870
Just like your mother.

594
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:43,010
Momma...

595
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,690
...take good care of our kids.

596
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,150
- You were a good parent Sid.
- Thanks!

597
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,020
- Can I baby-sit for you?
- Not a chance.

598
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:23,290
- Oh come on! I work cheap.
- Alright. I'll think about it.

599
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:27,770
- Yes!
- Never happened.

600
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,600
- He's gone. What am I supposed to do now?
- That's easy.

601
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:41,440
- Come with us.
- You mean... up there?

602
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:47,760
I never thought of going back. I've been
down here so long it feels like up to me.

603
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,050
I'm not sure I can fit-in
up there anymore.

604
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:55,930
So look at us.
We look like a normal herd to you?

605
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,120
Ouch!

606
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:25,750
So long big guy!

607
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:40,040
That's our queue. Come on Peaches.

608
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,640
He's alive.

609
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,880
Buck...

610
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:50,150
- I... I gotta...
- Yeah...

611
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:55,680
Besides this world should
really stay down here.

612
01:21:56,090 --> 01:22:01,210
- Take care of 'em tiger.
- "Always listen to Buck. "

613
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,710
We're almost out.

614
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:38,010
- Is everybody okay?
- Where's Buck?

615
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:43,810
Don't worry.
He's where he wants to be.

616
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,640
Is he going to be okay?

617
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:48,330
Are you kidding?
Nothing can kill that weasel.

618
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:51,670
It's Rudy I'm worried about.

619
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,670
I know this baby thing isn't for you.
But whatever you decide to do...

620
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:13,320
I'm not leaving buddy.
Life of adventure... It's right here.

621
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,990
Well I got a whole speech here.
I've been working on it.

622
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:19,410
How can I show
you that I'm strong and...

623
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:23,370
...sensitive? Noble yet caring?

624
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,390
Thanks!

625
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,230
Ah they grow so fast huh?
Look at my kids.

626
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,350
Seems they were born one
day and then gone the next.

627
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,740
- They were Sid.
- Yeah it was a lot of work.

628
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:07,690
It's right sweetheart.
Welcome to the Ice Age.

629
