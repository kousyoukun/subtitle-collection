很強的震感
That was a big one.

7
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:42,201
做噩夢了?
Bad dreams?

請關注ESPN台的地震新聞

你畫了很多畫 傑克

這是你夢中的雲中巨塔
This big tower in the clouds you keep dreaming about...

38
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:09,181
...你認為地震與之有關嗎?
...you say these earthquakes we've been having have something to do with it.

39
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:13,519
發生地震是因為塔被攻擊?
They happen because the tower is under attack.

40
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:20,484
你是個聰明的孩子 傑克
You're a smart kid, Jake.

41
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,153
問題是 人們不能區分
You know when you can't differentiate...

42
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,822
夢想和現實 - 這不是夢
...between dreams and reality-- - it's not a dream.

43

OK?我沒瘋

塔被什麼毀了?
What if the tower were destroyed?

47
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,298
黑暗與火
Darkness and fire.

48
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:47,386
我們來談談你爸爸吧
Let's talk about your dad.

49
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,682
真是個驚喜
Surprise.

50
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:55,102
你失去父親後 你的全世界崩塌了
When you lost your father, your world fell apart.

51
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,397
看到地球上即將發生的地獄景象
You have these visions of impending hell on earth...

52
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:01,734
只是你的內心感覺
...because that's how you feel inside.

53
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:04,487
甚至用了"黑暗與火"這樣的字眼...
Even words like "darkness" and "fire"...

54
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:08,366
來描述你父親死的那天晚上 傑克
...Jake, you're describing the night your father died.

55
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:10,910
只是可能
Can't just be about that.

56
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,578
只是夢境而已 傑克
They're just dreams, Jake.

57
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,498
這不是真的
They're not real.

58
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,443
小心
Watch out.

59
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:46,362
他們會帶走你
They'll take you.

60
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,738
他們偷你這樣的孩子
They steal kids like you.

61
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:49,240
躲開他們
Cross them over.

62
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:52,535
那些怪形
Special ones.

63
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:56,998
他們需要你的心靈力量
The power of your mind, that's what they want.

64
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,684
傑克 幹嘛呢
Jake. What's up?

65
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:18,769
糟糕的一天?
Bad day?

66
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,396
是的
Yeah.

67

我們走
Let's go.

68
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:23,733
你想上去嗎? - 是的
Want to hang out? - Yeah.

69
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,277
理智點 接受他們的提議
Control, he's unstable. We need to take the offer.

70
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:29,280
 不花錢的治療更好 - 問題不僅僅是錢
It's great treatment for no money. - It's not about the money.

71
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:30,698
去你的房間等著 - 我們沒辦法了
I'll wait in your room. - There's nothing more...

72
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:32,116
不能為他做的更多 - 老朗
...we can do for him now. - Jesus, lon!

73
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:35,244
你起碼假裝這是你親生的孩子
Can you at least pretend like he's your own kid?

74
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:42,001
對不起 兒子 我們沒有聽到你進來
I'm sorry, baby, we... We didn't hear you come in.

75
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:44,128
今天在學校發生了什麼?
What the hell happened in school today?

76
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,714
你答應過我不打架的
You promised me you're gonna stay out of trouble.

77
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,632
對不起 媽媽
Sorry, mom.

78
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:51,927
親愛的
Honey, um...

79

紐約有家靠近學校的診所

有大腦掃描檢查 睡眠障礙檢查
It's science-based: Brain scans, sleep patterns.

85
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,279
我想可以... - 好的
I think it could-- - yeah, okay.

86
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,410
那是神經病專區
Man, psycho camp.

87
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:17,745
糟透了 夥計
Sucks, dude.

88
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:21,248
只不過是又換醫生 純屬浪費時間
More shrinks. Waste of time.

89
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:23,083
塔

90
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,799
縫合的皮膚

91
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,633
夥計
Dude.

92
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,135
幹嘛
What?

93
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:34,762
別盯著畫看了
Stop staring at your drawings.

94
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:36,305
你又嚇我了
You're freaking me out.

95
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,059
你覺得我瘋了 對吧?
You think I'm crazy too, don't you?

96
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:41,894
說不定
Batshit.

97

99
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,828
才能活下去
We are falling apart.

100
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:00,496
我也愛他
I love him so much...

101
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:04,333
我無法忍受看到他那樣
...and I just can't stand to see him like this.

102
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,169
他本該是個快樂的孩子
He was such a happy kid.

103
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,982
別做夢了
No more dreams.

104
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,484
睡吧
Just one night of sleep.

105
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:53,340
你沒什麼好怕的 朋友
You have nothing to be afraid of, my friend.

106
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,969
死亡並不遙遠
Death is not far away.

107
00:10:57,678 --> 00:11:00,639
想知道另一邊是什麼嗎?
You want to know what's on the other side?

108
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,350
你能看見嗎?
Can you see it?

109
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,313
你當然不能
Of course you can't.

110
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,648
因為那邊什麼也沒有
Because nothing is there.

111
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,444
一切都是謊言 - 去死吧

It's all a lie. - Go to hell.

112
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:16,238
時間到 燃燒吧

只要塔還聳立著 就不算輸
Not while the tower still stands.

115
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,964
只要你還站著
Not while you still stand.

116
00:11:40,304 --> 00:11:42,097
別讓他進入你的心靈

117
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,058
槍俠

118
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:48,771
我不用我的手瞄準
I do not aim with my hand.

119
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:51,899
用手瞄準的人 忘記了他父親的臉
He who aims with his hand-- - has forgotten the face of his father.

120
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,275
我用我的眼睛瞄準

I shoot with my mind. - Gunslingers.

125
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:07,456
我不用我的槍殺人
I do not kill with my gun.

126
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:11,669
用槍殺人的人 忘記了他父親的臉

呼吸
Breathe.

131
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,393
醒醒
Fight it. Fight it!

132
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:39,280
你這套從來沒用 羅蘭?
It never works on you, does it, Roland?

133
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,409
你的能力不足以抗拒我的魔力
The power you have to resist my magics...

134
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,037
永遠不能
Not forever.

135
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,666
面對我
Face me!

136
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,168
面對我
Face me.

137
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,302
塔會倒塌的 羅蘭
The tower will fall, Roland.

138
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,472
下次見了 老朋友

槍俠跟著他

141
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:21,613
見鬼了
Holy shit.

142

00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:07,832
是的
Yeah.

285
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,711
他叫沃爾特?
Wait, his name's Walter?

286
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,172
酷 好吧 留著吧
Cool. Yeah, keep it.

287
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:30,104
我們會找到你的
I will find you.

288
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:35,985
跟蹤者只能這麼遠 我們去那裡
There's a tribe beyond that forest. We'll go there.

289
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:41,199
他們是先知 他能預知未來的場景
They have seers who will read your visions.

290
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:47,538
快點走 跟上
Let's go. Keep up-

291
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:50,959
OK
okay.

292
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,468
我往下滑
I went down the slide.

293
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:03,721
水濺到我鼻子 我下去...
Then I got water up my nose, and I went down...

294
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:05,431
我什麼都看不見 - 討厭
...and I couldn't see anything. - Hate.

295
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:07,100
嗯
Yeah.

296
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:12,313
甜心 你怎麼了?

Sweetheart? What's wrong?

297
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,669
萬歲 猩紅之王

298
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,416
萬歲 猩紅之王

299
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:58,487
沃爾特 蓬蓽生輝啊?
Walter padick. To what do we owe this great honor?

300
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:01,654
有人在你的城市使用了傳送門
Someone used a portal here, in your city...

301
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,990
你卻一無所知
...without your knowledge.

302
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:07,160
還殺了一個惡魔
Killed the house demon.

303
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,330
原諒我 先生
Forgive me, sire.

304
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:13,458
我們會查出罪犯 及其去處
We'll find out who this trespasser is and where he went.

305
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,835
已經找到了
Already on it.

306
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:17,754
像條好狗一樣聞一聞
Now be a good dog.

307
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:30,058
人類之血
The blood is human.

308
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:32,185
男孩的
Boy-

309
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:36,310
閃靈純淨
his shine is pure.

310
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:41,736
所以值得花力氣
So that's how he got through.

311
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:43,821
先生?
Sir?

312
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,032
惡魔是可怕的生物...
House demons are formidable beings...

313
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:49,911
...但是有很強的心靈能力的人能抵抗
...but a truly powerful psychic could override it.

314
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:53,748
帶閃靈的男孩足以殺死一個惡魔?
A boy with the shine strong enough to kill a demon?

315
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:55,708
大獎
Jackpot

316
00:30:55,875 --> 00:31:00,046
塞爾 兩個假皮人昨天都沒搞定一個男孩?
sayre, didn't two skins have trouble with a kid yesterday?

317
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:17,772
別吃這個
Don't eat that.

318
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:20,983
我不想剩下的路都背著你
Don't want to have to carry you for the rest of the way.

319
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:56,229
羅蘭?
Roland?

320
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:16,706
它們是什麼?
What are they?

321
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:18,249
假皮人
Taheen.

322
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,126
沃爾特的部下
They belong to Walter.

323
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:22,336
不要在樹林裡走 不安全
Don't run off in the woods. It's not safe.

324
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:24,922
你剛才轉身走了
But you were the one who ran off.

325
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:26,837
因為你說餓了
You said you were hungry.

326
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,513
什麼
What?

327
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,564
這裡以前有過山車
You had theme parks here.

328
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:49,489
這些古老的建築是在前世界之前建造的
These ancient structures are from before the world moved on.

329
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:51,949
沒有人知道前世界是什麼
No one knows what they are.

330
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:53,910
遊樂園
They're theme parks.

331
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,165
我看見他戰鬥了
I saw you fight him.

332
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:04,003
躺滿屍體的草地
There was a field covered with bodies.

333
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,971
那是我們最後的決戰
That was our final stand.

334
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:19,852
那天我失去了父親
I lost my father that day.

335
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:23,689
你看到了?
You saw that?

336
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,533
關於黑暗塔的?
Was it about the tower?

337
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,328
那次戰爭?
The war?

338
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:40,456
是的
Yes.

339
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,585
吃你的兔肉
Now, eat your rabbit.

340
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,678
很榮幸見到你 先生
It's an honor to meet you in person, sir.

341
00:33:53,844 --> 00:33:54,971
什麼風把你吹來了?
What brings you here?

342
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:56,305
如何效勞?
How may we serve him?

343
00:33:56,472 --> 00:33:58,516
我知道你丟了一個孩子
Well, I hear you lost a kid.

344
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:02,144
不是我們的錯
It-- it wasn't our fault.

345
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:05,773
就好像孩子知道我們是什麼一樣 我們正在盡所能找到他
It was as if the child knew what we were. We're doing everything we can--

346
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,985
名字和位置 - 一切都在這裡
name and location. -Lt's all in here.

347
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:17,159
傑克•錢伯斯
"Jake chambers."

348
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,956
現在
Now kill...

349
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:23,332
相互廝殺
...each other.

350
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:28,838
冷靜 玩得開心 夥計們
Calm down. Enjoy the show, folks.

351
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:32,174
什麼都沒看到
You ain't seen nothing yet.

352
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:43,728
你的手很巧
You draw with a good hand.

353
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:50,943
我只是不知道是什麼
I don't know what this is.

354
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:56,240
是地圖
It's a map.

355
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:02,079
我父親 曾經給我看過這樣的地圖
My father showed me a... A map like this once.

356
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:10,880
在圈子之內
Inside the circle is your world and my world...

357
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:12,923
...是你的世界和我的世界
...many others.

358
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:14,886
和其他世界 沒人知道有多少世界
No one knows how many.

359
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:20,014
黑暗塔矗立在萬物的中心
The dark tower stands at the center of all things.

360
00:35:22,183 --> 00:35:25,144
矗立于此 從琤j黎明起
And it's stood there from the beginning of time.

361
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:28,811
發出強大的能量保護宇宙
And it sends out powerful energy...

362
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:31,314
...保護我們隔絕外界
...that protects the universe...

363
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:33,944
你說 "外界" 是什麼意思?
...shields us from what's outside.

364
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:35,696
宇宙之外有什麼?
What do you mean, "outside"?

365
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:38,115
外界是一片巨大的黑暗
What's outside the universe?

366
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:45,247
充滿了試圖
Outside is endless darkness...

367
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:49,418
接近我們的惡魔
...full of demons trying to get to us.

368
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:53,881
沃爾特想拆除黑暗塔 放出惡魔
Walter wants to tear down the tower and let them in.

369
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:57,343
如果黑暗塔倒下
When the tower falls, he'll rule...

370
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,054
他將主宰一個充滿怪物的世界
...in a world full of monsters.

371
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:03,057
你們是想阻止他 對嗎?
But you're trying to stop him, aren't you?

372
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:06,143
所以必須保護黑暗塔
To protect the tower.

373
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:08,688
我看到他們試圖摧毀塔 ...
I've seen them try to destroy it.

374
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:11,899
只要我們到達 - 不存在"我們" 傑克
If we could just get there-- - there is no "we," Jake.

375
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:14,485
對我來說重要的是
All that matters to me is that I find...

376
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:17,154
找到並殺死沃爾特
...and kill Walter.

377
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,570
只是我
That's it.

378
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,909
梁式地震
Beamquake.

379
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:05,411
強大
Strong.

380
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:08,289
聽起來像在尖叫
Sounds like screams.

381
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:19,845
就像我家那次地震
They're just like the quakes we get back home.

382
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:23,804
對 一個世界發生什麼...
Yeah, what happens in one world...

383
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:25,723
會映射到其他世界
...echoes in others.

384
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,226
我希望我媽沒事
Hope my mom's okay.

385
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:34,937
睡會兒
Try to get some sleep.

386
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:40,029
最好不過了
That's not happening.

387
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,205
傑克
Jake.

388
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:54,418
傑克
Jake.

389
00:38:06,305 --> 00:38:07,473
嗨 我的孩子
Hey, kiddo.

390
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,603
你在哪裡?
Where are you?

391
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:29,411
與你同行的人都會死
Everyone who walks with you dies.

392
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:41,131
傑克
Jake.

393
00:38:56,894 --> 00:38:57,978
嗨 我的孩子
Hey, kiddo.

394
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:01,735
爸爸?
Dad?

395
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:04,822
很久了
Long time.

396
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,160
很高興見到你 你長高了
It's good to see you, man. You got tall.

397
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:12,830
這不是真的
This isn't real.

398
00:39:13,956 --> 00:39:15,791
你... - 死了?
You're-- - dead?

399
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,918
這裡的我沒死
Not here.

400
00:39:19,795 --> 00:39:21,255
我想你
I missed you.

401
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:23,299
我想念你 我的孩子
I missed you too, kiddo.

402
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:25,342
無需害怕
Come on.

403
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:26,719
沒事了
It's okay.

404
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,224
回家吧
Let's go home.

405
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:39,398
不
No.

406
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:45,738
黑暗與火
Darkness and fire.

407
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:52,202
傑克
Jake!

408
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:54,163
別再靠近了
Get away from it!

409
00:40:12,436 --> 00:40:15,106
羅蘭 我的兒子
Roland. My son.

410
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:18,270
跟我來
Come with me.

411
00:40:26,445 --> 00:40:27,446
不要害怕
It's okay.

412
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:29,448
他走了
It's gone.

413
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:33,285
剛才是我爸爸
My dad was in there.

414
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:36,580
不 那是你的弱點
No, they sense your weakness...

415
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:39,291
用幻覺來分散你的注意力
...create illusions to distract you.

416
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:42,711
他不是你認識的任何人 傑克
That wasn't anybody you know.

417
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,506
對不起
I'm sorry.

418
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:52,888
這種小裂縫
That was just a small tear.

419
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:56,058
在塔的每次被攻擊後會出現
They happen after every attack on the tower.

420
00:40:56,225 --> 00:41:00,062
這些生物會出現 只要塔倒掉 是嗎?
Those things, they're what's coming if the tower falls, aren't they?

421
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:01,271
是的
Yes.

422
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:04,149
但如果你找到了攻擊黑暗塔的孩子
But if we find that place where they're keeping the kids, we could--

423
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:06,276
什麼?
shh, shh, shh. - What?

424
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,112
有東西來了
Something got out.

425
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:18,789
跑 傑克 快跑
Run! Jake, run!

426
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,293
你需要幫助
You're gonna need help.

427
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,003
沒必要
I've hurt worse.

428
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:50,380
你在流血
But you're bleeding.

429
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:53,008
我恢復很快
I heal fast.

430
00:42:55,305 --> 00:42:57,515
你剛才表現不錯
You handled yourself well.

431
00:42:57,682 --> 00:43:00,310
試圖抓住那把槍 很勇敢
That was brave, going for the gun.

432
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:05,270
你會找到他的 勞麗
They're gonna find him, Laurie.

433
00:43:05,646 --> 00:43:08,816
我們填完了所有的表格 貼了他的照片
We filled out every form. They have his picture.

434
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:23,288
希望你不要介意我把這裡當成自家
I hope you don't mind me making myself at home.

435
00:43:23,455 --> 00:43:25,499
我來的地方沒有雞肉
Where I come from, we don't have chicken.

436
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:28,210
你到底是什麼人? - 你不瞭解我 老朗
Who the hell are you? - Oh, you know me, lon.

437
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:30,129
是你召喚我來的
You're the one that called me here.

438
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:31,338
...希望得到他媽媽更多的愛
Not by the telephone...

439
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:34,550
不用電話 只需很強烈的願望
...but with your every desire to get rid of the brat...

440
00:43:34,716 --> 00:43:37,427
甩掉那個小傢伙
...all in the hopes that mommy there might love you best.

441
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:41,640
你這懦夫 老朗
But you'll always be a seat-filler, lon.

442
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,184
馬上離開這裡 - 老朗
You get out of here right now. - Lon.

443
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:47,938
這男人 出現在傑克的畫作裡
It's the man from Jake's drawings.

444
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,776
畫作?
Drawings?

445
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:56,947
停止呼吸
Stop breathing.

446
00:43:58,117 --> 00:43:59,701
安靜
Aah! - Quiet.

447
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:04,288
畫畫
Drawings.

448
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,590
演示給我看
Show me.

449
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:49,208
看來我似乎被震驚了
Well, it looks like I've got myself a stalker.

450
00:45:05,724 --> 00:45:07,601
槍俠
Gunslinger.

451
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:25,410
你兒子很有天賦吧?
This son of yours is quite special, isn't he?

452
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:41,134
你會感到...
The guilt you must feel...

453
00:45:42,636 --> 00:45:44,888
很內疚
...not believing in him.

454
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:49,810
因為你沒有相信他 卻把唯一的孩子送到瘋人院
And you sent your only child off to the asylum.

455
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:55,354
你真
Shame...

456
00:45:56,316 --> 00:45:58,318
可恥
...on you.

457
00:46:46,444 --> 00:46:49,847
終點站

458
00:46:58,712 --> 00:46:59,880
外人接近
Stranger approaching!

459
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:05,552
全都過來
Gather round!

460
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:12,392
白日漫長 夜晚反而愉悅
Long days, pleasant nights.

461
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,519
時日如年
May you have twice that number.

462
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:18,607
我從小就見過你這樣的人
I haven't seen one of your kind since I was a young man.

463
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:20,567
現在 我看到的是活人槍俠
Seeing you here, alive--

464
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:22,652
誰的心靈力量最強?
who's your strongest seer?

465
00:47:23,236 --> 00:47:24,363
是我
That would be me.

466
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,945
我是艾拉
I'm arra.

467
00:47:27,908 --> 00:47:30,410
這個男孩看到了這地方的幻象
The boy here has visions of this place.

468
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:34,164
需要知道具體方位
I need to know where it is.

469
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:40,128
黑衣人
The man in black.

470
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:42,464
我們設法嚴重破壞黑暗塔 先生
We managed to do some serious damage, sir...

471
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:44,549
但沒有動搖 - 動搖?不重要了
...but it didn't fall. - None of that matters.

472
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:47,469
我找到了好辦法 那男孩獨自一人...
I found the one. This kid's going to bring down the tower...

473
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:50,055
即可拆掉黑暗塔
...all by his lonesome.

474
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:52,682
這個孩子在哪裡? - 他就在這裡
Where is this child? - He's here...

475
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,476
中世界
...on mid-world...

476
00:47:54,643 --> 00:47:58,313
和我一位老朋友一起 羅蘭•埃爾德
...looking for an old friend of mine, Roland of eld.

477
00:47:59,272 --> 00:48:01,566
等等 我以為所有的槍俠都死了
Wait, I thought all the gunslingers were dead.

478
00:48:02,317 --> 00:48:04,236
羅蘭總是有能力
Roland's always had an annoying ability...

479
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:06,405
抵抗我魔力
...to resist my magics.

480
00:48:06,571 --> 00:48:08,657
我殺了他所愛的人
So I killed everyone he ever cared about.

481
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:12,285
我聽說他在莫黑地區漫無目的地徘徊
Last I heard, he was roaming the mohaine aimlessly.

482
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:14,788
也就是男孩要去的地方 - 莫黑 沙漠...?
That's where the boy is going. - Mohaine desert? Isn't that--?

483
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:17,374
那裡有男孩的閃靈
Vast. Yes. And so is this boy's shine.

484
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,460
我會立即派遣追蹤者到此地區 先生
I'll send our trackers in the region, sir.

485
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:33,432
情況會變得更糟
This will get worse.

486
00:48:33,598 --> 00:48:36,435
我沒辦法處理
I don't have anything that can help with that.

487
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:38,228
你需要休息 直到癒合
You need to rest, let it heal.

488
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:40,605
我會沒事的
I'll be fine.

489
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:44,401
謝謝 塞爾
Thankee, sai.

490
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:46,736
你從遙遠的地球來到這裡找到了他
You've come all the way from keystone earth to find him.

491
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:52,117
帶著我從未見過的閃靈
His shine is beyond anything I've ever seen.

492
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:54,953
"閃靈"?
Shine?

493
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,288
超自然力量
Psychic powers.

494
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,249
很少有人生來就有這個天賦
Very few are born with this gift.

495
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:03,462
通常 這種力量是如此輕盈 常人根本不知道其存在
Often, the power is so slight, people don't even know they have it.

496
00:49:04,176 --> 00:49:07,763
你的閃靈如此強大 傑克
Your shine burns so brightly, Jake.

497
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:11,928
你擁有有我不懂的潛質
You have potential i can't even begin to understand.

498
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:17,601
她的聲音出現過我腦海中
Her voice was in my head.

499
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:20,520
你的天賦很驚人 傑克
Your gift is extraordinary, Jake.

500
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:23,938
能讓你穿越世界的界限
It made you see across worlds.

501
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:26,943
畫作
The drawing.

502
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,528
畫作有什麼?
What about the drawing?

503
00:49:31,865 --> 00:49:34,034
集中注意力
Concentrate.

504
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:36,953
與我分享你的幻覺
Share your visions with me.

505
00:49:44,085 --> 00:49:46,236
放開些
Open up.

506
00:49:47,714 --> 00:49:49,591
給我看
Show me.

507
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:57,265
黑衣人
The man in black--

508
00:49:57,392 --> 00:49:58,602
傑克
Jake.

509
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:00,727
...逃進了沙漠
Fled across the desert.

510
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:06,024
告訴我
Tell me.

511
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:07,859
那是哪裡?
Where is he?

512
00:50:09,402 --> 00:50:10,779
北方的巫術遺址
Northern wastelands.

513
00:50:15,408 --> 00:50:17,827
需要六個月的路程
That's more than six months of travel.

514
00:50:19,788 --> 00:50:21,748
但你可以送我更快到達
But you can get me there faster than that.

515
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:24,751
黑衣人通過傳送門旅行
The man in black and his men keep track of all portal travel.

516
00:50:24,918 --> 00:50:27,754
我得去那裡 - 傳送門?
I need to get there. - Portals.

517
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:30,173
就像我們能幫上忙一樣
We couldn't help you, even if we wanted to.

518
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,010
你只能從他們的基地訪問他們的終點站
The only way to access their territories is from one of their own bases.

519
00:50:36,388 --> 00:50:38,515
那我步行去
Then I'll make it on foot.

520
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:40,392
等等
Wait.

521
00:50:42,056 --> 00:50:44,225
假皮人從
The fake-skins...

522
00:50:44,938 --> 00:50:47,232
不同的世界帶走孩子 對嗎?
...they take kids from different worlds, right?

523
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:48,942
他們出現在紐約市
They tried to take me from New York.

524
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:52,195
這意味著? - 在那裡有一個基地
Doesn't that mean that they--? - They have a base there.

525
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:56,074
一個可以帶我去這個地方的傳送門
With a portal that can take me right to this place.

526
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:01,246
你得把我們送到地球
You're gonna send us to keystone earth.

527
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:13,633
利用發電機的能量
We're diverting power to the generators.

528
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,844
傳送門將很快準備就緒
The portal will be ready shortly.

529
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,890
你的世界裡有槍嗎?
Do they have guns in your world?

530
00:51:22,142 --> 00:51:23,184
有的
Yeah.

531
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:27,147
子彈呢?和這裡一樣罕見嗎?
And bullets, are they as rare as they are here?

532
00:51:28,275 --> 00:51:30,318
你會愛上地球的 子彈多的很
You're gonna like earth. A lot.

533
00:51:36,865 --> 00:51:40,744
我們同意只有在村子有危險的時候才使用傳送門
We agreed we'd never use the portal unless the village was in danger.

534
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,704
一旦被發現 我們全都完了
They will find out we have it and come.

535
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:46,041
我們不能拒絕槍俠 這是法律
We can't disobey a gunslinger. It's the law.

536
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:48,835
你怎麼知道它是什麼?
How do you know what he is? - Arra.

537
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:50,211
所以 你應該感受到他了
You must have read him.

538
00:51:50,837 --> 00:51:52,881
你看到了什麼?
What do you see?

539
00:51:56,217 --> 00:51:58,678
他是基列的羅蘭
He's Roland of gilead.

540
00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:00,347
上一代槍俠的繼承人
Last of the line of eld.

541
00:52:05,894 --> 00:52:09,272
但黑衣人的靈魂在他的口袋裡
But the man in black has his soul in his pocket...

542
00:52:09,814 --> 00:52:13,526
...他的內心充滿了復仇
...and his heart's consumed by vengeance.

543
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:15,945
不是槍俠了
He's not a gunslinger.

544
00:52:16,948 --> 00:52:18,867
不再是了
Not anymore.

545
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:22,160
或許你需要辯解?
Or would you tell us differently?

546
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,206
只有上帝知道
Only a goat would lie to a seer.

547
00:52:26,373 --> 00:52:28,458
你玷污了你的祖先嗎?
You dishonor your ancestors.

548
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,919
槍俠發誓要保衛這座塔
The gunslingers have sworn an oath to defend the tower--

549
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:32,754
看看你周圍
look around you.

550
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:35,465
戰爭結束了 我們輸了
The war is over, and we lost.

551
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:42,472
如果你離開你們的小天堂 你會親眼看到的
If you left your little haven, you would see that for yourself.

552
00:52:43,223 --> 00:52:45,934
黑暗無處不在
The darkness is everywhere...

553
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:48,311
除了戰鬥 不存在任何東西
...and trying to fight against it accomplishes nothing.

554
00:52:50,313 --> 00:52:53,483
在你們出生前 我就註定要為保衛塔而終生
I was fighting to defend the tower before most of you were even born.

555
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,902
永遠都有一場戰役在等待
There's always a battle.

556
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:57,612
永遠
Always.

557
00:52:58,071 --> 00:52:59,280
但現在不需要了
But no more.

558
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,659
因為這個原因我們輸了?
Isn't that why we're losing?

559
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:05,578
因為一切都不再相信
Because everyone stopped believing.

560
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:10,709
只要黑暗存在於外界 塔註定會倒塌
As long as the darkness is out there, the tower will fall.

561
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:14,462
在那之前 我會報復
And before that happens, i will get my revenge.

562
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,028
聽著
Look.

563
00:53:35,024 --> 00:53:36,234
你救了我的命
He saved my life.

564
00:53:38,236 --> 00:53:40,321
他根本就不喜歡我
And he doesn't even like me that much.

565
00:53:43,283 --> 00:53:44,909
他還是槍俠
He's still a gunslinger.

566
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:47,954
我知道的
I know he is.

567
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:53,710
你應隨時準備好

你不能帶著武器去醫院

杜尚先生 - 把我的武器拿來

01:06:11,197 --> 01:06:12,781
你是他們其中一個 對嗎?
You were one of them, weren't you?

712
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:16,494
我弄丟了 閃靈

I lost it. The shine.

713
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,871
通道在哪裡 記得嗎?
Which way did they take you through?

714
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:21,916
你得趕緊跑 - 傳送門 一扇門
No, no, you have to run. - Do you remember? A portal, a door.

715
01:06:22,082 --> 01:06:23,959
就要結束了 - 什麼 拜託
Anything, please. -It's almost over.

716
01:06:24,126 --> 01:06:25,336
就要結束了
It's almost over.

717
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:27,296
就要結束了
It's almost over. It's almost over.

718
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:29,924
你能聽到我說話嗎?
Can you hear me?

719
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,884
記得 給我看
Remember. Show me.

720
01:06:35,554 --> 01:06:36,597
迪克西
Dixie.

721
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:38,015
傑克
Jake!

722
01:06:39,183 --> 01:06:40,893
傑克
Jake!

723
01:06:42,061 --> 01:06:44,188
必須掩蓋閃靈
They can track the shine.

724
01:06:44,355 --> 01:06:45,898
OK?
Okay?

725
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:51,320
我知道你是誰
I know what you are.

726
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:54,615
槍俠
Gunslinger.

727
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:57,368
不再是了
Go.

728
01:07:02,414 --> 01:07:05,584
我有資料 必須回家做研究
Should have enough to find it. Got to get home and do some research.

729
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:09,171
在你家? - 對 告訴我媽媽 我沒事
Your home? - Yeah, I got to let my morn know I'm okay.

730
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,882
整個城市我們都設置了追蹤者
We have trackers spread throughout the city.

731
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:13,592
只要閃靈信號足夠強大的話
There's no trace of him yet, sir.

732
01:07:13,759 --> 01:07:15,886
就能檢測到
Couple of small spikes, but not enough to hone in on.

733
01:07:16,053 --> 01:07:17,263
別擔心 我的孩子
Don't you worry, dicky-boy.

734
01:07:17,429 --> 01:07:19,139
迪克西已全面覆蓋 - 先生?
L've got you covered. - Sir?

735
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:22,476
我給我們的小朋友留下了一個驚喜 請做好準備
I left a surprise for our little friend. Just be ready.

736
01:07:22,682 --> 01:07:25,435
最好在這裡等 - 夥計
You should probably wait here. - Dude.

737
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:27,648
你到底去哪了? - 提米
Where the hell have you been? - Timmy. Um...

738
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:28,941
他是誰?
Who's that?

739
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:31,735
我晚點再告訴你
I'll tell you later.

740
01:07:31,902 --> 01:07:34,321
媽媽和老朗怎麼樣了?我嚇壞了
How's morn and lon? They must be freaking out.

741
01:07:34,613 --> 01:07:36,407
從昨天就失蹤了
They haven't been home since yesterday.

742
01:07:39,368 --> 01:07:40,911
媽媽 媽媽
Mom. Mom.

743
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:52,631
媽媽? - 傑克
Mom? - Jake.

744
01:07:52,759 --> 01:07:54,052
媽媽? - 傑克
Mom? Mom! Morn! - Jake!

745
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,305
不
No.

746
01:07:59,763 --> 01:08:00,806
不
No, no.

747
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:04,768
不 媽媽 不
No, no. No, no, no.

748
01:08:05,811 --> 01:08:07,146

No,no,no.

749
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:09,648

不 不 媽媽
No, no, mom.

753
01:08:25,331 --> 01:08:26,624
畫作 - 媽媽
Drawings. - Mom.

754
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:27,958
很快就會結束
I'll make it quick.

755
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:29,877
傑克
Jake!

756
01:08:33,174 --> 01:08:34,509
不
No.

757
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:36,008
不 傑克
No, Jake.

758
01:08:36,383 --> 01:08:38,260
你別用閃靈 - 媽媽
Don't see it. - Mom.

759
01:08:38,427 --> 01:08:40,638
別讓他正中下懷
It's what he wants.

760
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,350
他在追蹤你 - 她死了
He's tracking you. - She's dead.

761
01:08:44,516 --> 01:08:45,643
閉上你的心靈
Close your mind.

762
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:49,271
讓痛苦從你體內流逝 傑克
Close your mind. Let the pain run through you, Jake.

763
01:08:50,397 --> 01:08:51,440
他殺了她
He killed her.

764
01:08:52,191 --> 01:08:54,276
我知道 - 被殺害了
I know. I know. - He killed her.

765
01:08:58,614 --> 01:09:00,115
過來
Come here.

766
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:32,898
我會殺了他
I will kill him.

767
01:09:34,483 --> 01:09:35,734
為我們倆
For both of us.

768
01:09:43,573 --> 01:09:45,700
那塔怎麼辦?
What about the tower?

769
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:54,795
我媽死了 報仇就夠了嗎?
My mom died so you could have your revenge?

770
01:09:59,049 --> 01:10:01,719
也許你的世界已然毀滅 但我的世界還沒有
Maybe your world is almost gone, but mine isn't.

771
01:10:01,885 --> 01:10:04,680
你自己說的因為黑暗在那裡
You said it yourself, as long as the darkness is out there...

772
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:07,349
塔總是處於危險之中
...the tower's always in danger.

773
01:10:11,103 --> 01:10:13,147
你知道他們是對的
You know, they were right.

774
01:10:16,108 --> 01:10:18,277
你不再是槍俠了
You're not a gunslinger.

775
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:24,074
這裡
Here.

776
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:26,493
就是所謂的迪克西
It's called the Dixie pig.

777
01:10:26,785 --> 01:10:28,287
控制中心
It's on Plymouth and Pearl.

778
01:10:44,219 --> 01:10:46,305
我年輕的時候
When I was younger...

779
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,893
得到槍俠訓練
...l would recite the gunslinger's creed.

780
01:10:53,562 --> 01:10:56,023
平靜的心和心靈
It calms the heart and the mind.

781
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:00,194
跟隨我去過很多地方
I haven't spoken it for years.

782
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:26,053
我不用我的手瞄準
I do not aim with my hand.

783
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:30,265
用手瞄準的人 忘記了他父親的臉
He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.

784
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,268
我用我的眼睛瞄準
I aim with my eye.

785
01:11:36,398 --> 01:11:38,984
我不會用手開槍的
I do not shoot with my hand.

786
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:43,153
用手射擊的人 忘記了他父親的臉
He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.

787
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,322
我用心靈射擊
I shoot with my mind.

788
01:11:58,293 --> 01:12:00,254
我不用我的槍殺人
I do not kill with my gun.

789
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,924
用槍殺人的人 忘記了他父親的臉
Both he who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.

790
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:06,343
只要塔還聳立著 就不算輸
Not while the tower still stands.

791
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,719
只要你還站著
Not while you still stand.

792
01:12:07,886 --> 01:12:10,013
我用我的心殺人 - 我用我的心殺人
I kill with my heart. - I kill with my heart.

793
01:12:20,148 --> 01:12:21,984
幹得好
That's good.

794
01:12:22,818 --> 01:12:24,611
閃靈是你的武器 傑克
Your shine is your weapon, Jake.

795
01:12:27,116 --> 01:12:29,118
這些武器是我的
Guns are mine.

796
01:12:45,632 --> 01:12:47,801
你想要什麼 夥計們?
Can I help you fellas?

797
01:12:48,677 --> 01:12:50,804
戰神.45子彈
Hey. - Forty-five-caliber bullets.

798
01:12:52,264 --> 01:12:54,516
我只是... - 我全部要了
I only have-- - we'll take them all.

799
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:56,560
按他說的去做 不然會受傷的
Just do what he says. He won't hurt you.

800
01:12:56,727 --> 01:12:57,978
我不想惹麻煩
I don't want any trouble.

801
01:12:58,645 --> 01:13:00,314
你比很多人都聰明
Well, then you're smarter than most.

802
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:01,982
快點
Hurry up-

803
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:15,370
好吧 去安全的地方
all right, let's get you somewhere safe.

804
01:13:16,246 --> 01:13:17,873
槍俠
Gunslinger.

805
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:22,419
你想我嗎
Did you miss me?

806
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,758
看來挺想我的
Well, I guess you did.

807
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:29,718
羅蘭
Roland! Roland, Roland.

808
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:31,136
傑克 跑
Jake, run.

809
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,763
快跑
Run!

810
01:13:42,314 --> 01:13:46,151
最後你終於找到了一個羅盤 但你卻自投羅網
I see you finally found a compass, yet you still came to me.

811
01:13:47,027 --> 01:13:49,071
我是你唯一的歸宿 羅蘭
Because I'm your only destination, Roland.

812
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:52,574
開槍
Fire away.

813
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:56,495
不是我的錯 我不是自願的
It's not me. I'm not doing this.

814
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:01,708
你要拯救塔
First, you want to save the tower.

815
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:04,878
必須先殺了黑衣人
Then, kill the man in black.

816
01:14:09,257 --> 01:14:12,427
你就像一條狗 一遍又一遍撿樹枝
You are like a dog fetching a stick over and over.

817
01:14:12,594 --> 01:14:15,097
你說你的老隊員怎麼了?
You tell the kid what happened to the old crew?

818
01:14:15,302 --> 01:14:18,806
有人和你同行 死在我手裡嗎?
You tell him that everyone that walks with you dies by my hand?

819
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:20,185
這次不行
Not this time.

820
01:14:20,352 --> 01:14:22,145
你皮膚光滑的媽媽呢?
Your soft-skinned mother?

821
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:24,231
你的槍俠搭檔呢? - 面對我
Your gunslinger friends? - Face me.

822
01:14:24,398 --> 01:14:25,983
你多愁善感的父親呢
Your whimpering excuse for a dad.

823
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:29,611
別躲在魔法後面 面對我 沃爾特
Stop hiding behind your magic and face me, Walter!

824
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,491
我們知道無論誰先通過終點線
We both know that no matter who crosses the finish line first...

825
01:14:34,658 --> 01:14:37,661
...宇宙終將消失
...the universe will die out eventually.

826
01:14:38,161 --> 01:14:40,414
死亡永勝
Death always wins.

827
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,290
這是事實
That's the deal.

828
01:14:50,674 --> 01:14:52,384
不
No, no.

829
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,013
羅蘭
Roland.

830
01:14:56,885 --> 01:14:58,553
羅蘭
Roland.

831
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,404
迪克西

832
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:33,050
傑克•錢伯斯
Jake chambers.

833
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:45,062
你是個昂貴的模特 好比電視廣告
You are the full package, as advertised.

834
01:15:47,397 --> 01:15:49,858
塞爾 振作起來
Sayre, get ready.

835
01:15:50,025 --> 01:15:53,070
參加貴族聚會
Tall, dark and handsome is about to crash the party.

836
01:16:13,799 --> 01:16:15,967
動起來
Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

837
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:17,219
拿槍 出發
Take one and go.

838
01:16:22,682 --> 01:16:26,561
很好 讓他們嘗嘗痛苦的滋味吧
Alrighty. Let's go put everyone out of their misery, shall we?

839
01:16:26,728 --> 01:16:28,313
準備好
Any time, champ.

840
01:16:46,289 --> 01:16:47,624
羅蘭
Roland.

841
01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:57,050
羅蘭
Roland...

842
01:16:57,217 --> 01:16:59,010
去那個地方
...they're taking me to that place.

843
01:16:59,177 --> 01:17:00,679
小心
Be careful.

844
01:17:00,846 --> 01:17:02,013
堅持住
Hang on.

845
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,598
我會來救你的
I'm coming for you.

846
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:20,073
交給我們吧
We'll get him, sir.

847
01:17:20,448 --> 01:17:21,658
再見
Bye.

848
01:17:24,077 --> 01:17:26,163
為了天啟
Have a great apocalypse.

849
01:17:28,707 --> 01:17:30,500
擋住他
Close in on him!

850
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:35,672
OK
Okay.

851
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:51,980
動手
Let's go. - Sir.

852
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:54,024
已連接
We're online!

853
01:18:02,908 --> 01:18:06,411
最終是時候了嗎? - 對 時間到
It's really gonna happen, isn't it? - Oh, yes, it is.

854
01:19:23,029 --> 01:19:25,073
有點不對勁
Somethings wrong.

855
01:19:26,366 --> 01:19:30,036
頻率中斷 - 水準下降
Somethings wrong here. The levels are plateauing.

856
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:32,165
就像... - 抵抗了
It's as if he's-- - fighting back.

857
01:19:34,374 --> 01:19:36,626
為什麼抗拒?
Why do you resist?

858
01:19:36,793 --> 01:19:39,004
你的幻覺是給我的 不是給他
Your visions didn't bring you to him, they brought you to me.

859
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:41,715
我們愛你 我們關心你
He doesn't love you. He doesn't care for you.

860
01:19:41,881 --> 01:19:45,218
從一開始 你找的就是我
In fact, he's been using you this entire time to get to me.

861
01:19:45,385 --> 01:19:48,513
這就是為什麼你在這裡 這是你的宿命
This is why you're here. This is your destiny.

862
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,682
你殺了我媽
You killed my morn!

863
01:19:50,849 --> 01:19:52,809
天註定
Yes, that's it. There we go.

864
01:20:52,243 --> 01:20:53,953
傳送門 閉合了?
Portal. Close it.

865
01:20:54,745 --> 01:20:56,226
未知旁路

866
01:20:56,748 --> 01:20:58,666
閉合? - 我們能行的
Close it! - I can't!

867
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:02,170
等等
Wait.

868
01:21:04,297 --> 01:21:06,716
上帝 那孩子
Oh, my god. It's the kid.

869
01:21:06,883 --> 01:21:09,719
在堅持打開傳送門
It's the kid! He's keeping the portal open!

870
01:21:11,096 --> 01:21:13,515
令人印象深刻
Ahh. Impressive.

871
01:21:20,397 --> 01:21:22,315
想面對老朋友嗎
So you wanted me to face you, old friend?

872
01:21:24,776 --> 01:21:26,027
我來了
Here I am.

873
01:22:16,035 --> 01:22:19,205
你該和塔一起消失
It's fitting that you and the tower should fall together.

874
01:23:10,632 --> 01:23:11,674
羅蘭

875
01:23:14,636 --> 01:23:16,596
羅蘭 起來
Roland, get up.

876
01:23:22,101 --> 01:23:24,437
我不用我的手瞄準
I do not aim with my hand.

877
01:23:24,604 --> 01:23:28,191
用手瞄準的人 忘記了他父親的臉
He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.

878
01:23:28,983 --> 01:23:30,485
我用我的眼睛瞄準

879

我不會用手開槍的

880

用手射擊的人

881

忘記了他父親的臉

882
01:23:43,957 --> 01:23:45,166
我用我的心靈射擊
Jake". I shoot with my mind.

883
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,252
我用我的心靈射擊
I shoot with my mind.

884
01:23:48,586 --> 01:23:50,922
我不用我的槍殺人
Jake". I do not kill with my gun.

885
01:23:52,715 --> 01:23:54,842
用槍殺人的人

886
01:23:55,009 --> 01:23:56,636
忘記了他父親的臉

889
01:25:47,038 --> 01:25:48,456
媽媽 爸爸
Mom, dad.

890
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:50,124
他們來了 - 甜心
There they are. - Sweetheart.

891
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:52,251
真高興你在

許多目擊者看到了

893

天空中的奇怪現象
...the strange phenomena in the sky.

894
01:26:02,136 --> 01:26:03,471
看來最壞的事已經結束了
Looks like we've seen the worst of it...

895
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:05,473
氣象中心現在已經發佈了一份聲明
The weather center has now issued a statement...

896
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,518

897
01:26:11,521 --> 01:26:13,523
拿去 - 什麼啊?

900
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:20,905
什麼品種的狗?
What breed?

901
01:26:21,072 --> 01:26:22,657
不 不是真的狗
No, it's not a breed.

902
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:32,041
我得離開這裡 傑克
I have to leave here, Jake.

903
