1
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:39,788
Come and play with us. Come and play.

2
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,127
- Not gonna get me!
- You wish!

3
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:34,468
- Jake.
- Mom, you okay?

4
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:38,138
That was a big one.

5
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:41,975
Bad dreams?

6
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,186
No.

7
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,940
Come on. Get breakfast.

8
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:03,247
<i>This morning's quake is causing
major problems for commuters.</i>

9
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:07,459
<i>The 5.7-magnitude quake hit
New York early this morning.</i>

10
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:10,963
<i>Yet another in a series of quakes
that has rattled both coasts.</i>

11
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,841
<i>Tokyo was hit again. And with
the Berlin quake last week... </i>

12
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,053
<i>Question is: What is causing
all these earthquakes?</i>

13
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,515
Christ, even ESPN's
doing the quakes now.

14
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:24,351
<i>But we still don't know
what's causing them.</i>

15
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:26,061
Hey. My folks sent me over to see... 

16
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,348
- ... if you guys are still alive.
- We're fine, Timmy.

17
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:29,731
That was pretty intense.

18
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:32,276
- Yeah.
- You good?

19
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,653
- Yeah.
- We're just running a little late.

20
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,947
- See you later?
- Say hi to your mom for me.

21
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:38,991
Ma, Laurie says hi.

22
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:41,243
Don't forget, you have Dr.
Hotchkiss after school.

23
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,295
We're wasting money
on all those shrinks.

24
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:54,464
He's making progress.

25
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,033
Wait up!

26
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,039
Hey, did you get the
books from my locker?

27
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,499
So when's the apocalypse coming?

28
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,877
Come on, man, just give me my book.

29
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,172
- What's wrong, your meds stop working?
- Hey! Hey!

30
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,090
- Give me my book!
- Get off me!

31
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:38,967
- Get off of me.
- Hey!

32
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:41,219
Hey. That is enough, Chambers.

33
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,139
I need my book.

34
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:48,810
Hey. You need to go home and cool off.

35
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,026
You've been, uh, quite busy, Jake.

36
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:03,450
This big tower in the clouds
you keep dreaming about... 

37
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:08,955
... you say these earthquakes we've been
having have something to do with it.

38
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:13,293
They happen because the
Tower is under attack.

39
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:20,258
You're a smart kid, Jake.

40
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:22,025
You know when you can't differentiate... 

41
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:24,596
- ... between dreams and reality-
- It's not a dream.

42
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:25,889
Okay? I'm not crazy.

43
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,517
I always see the same thing.

44
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:32,437
The Tower, the Man in Black, the
creepy guys with the fake skins.

45
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,193
What if the Tower were destroyed?

46
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,072
Darkness and fire.

47
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,160
Let's talk about your dad.

48
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,456
Surprise.

49
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,876
When you lost your father,
your world fell apart.

50
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:58,171
You have these visions of
impending hell on Earth... 

51
00:06:58,338 --> 00:07:01,508
... because that's how you feel inside.

52
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,261
Even words like "darkness" and "fire"... 

53
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:08,140
... Jake, you're describing
the night your father died.

54
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:10,684
Can't just be about that.

55
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,352
They're just dreams, Jake.

56
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:15,272
They're not real.

57
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,217
Watch out.

58
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:46,136
They'll take you.

59
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:47,512
They steal kids like you.

60
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,014
Cross them over.

61
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:52,309
Special ones.

62
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:56,772
The power of your mind,
that's what they want.

63
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,458
Jake. What's up?

64
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,543
Bad day?

65
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,170
Yeah.

66
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:21,922
Let's go.

67
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:23,507
- Want to hang out?
- Yeah.

68
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:26,051
... control, he's unstable.
We need to take the offer.

69
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:29,054
- It's great treatment for no money.
- It's not about the money.

70
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,079
<i>- I'll</i> wait in your room.
- There's nothing more... 

71
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:32,903
- ... we can do for him now.
- Jesus, Lon!

72
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:35,424
Can you at least pretend
like he's your own kid?

73
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:41,775
I'm sorry, baby, we... We
didn't hear you come in.

74
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,902
What the hell happened in school today?

75
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:46,488
You promised me you're
gonna stay out of trouble.

76
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:48,406
Sorry, Mom.

77
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,701
Honey, um... 

78
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:55,330
... the school's been approached
by a clinic upstate.

79
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,332
They work with kids who... 

80
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,126
Who are having a hard time.

81
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:02,003
There's an opening this weekend.

82
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:04,548
It's supposed to be a great place.

83
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:07,092
It's science-based: Brain
scans, sleep patterns.

84
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,053
- I think it could... 
- Yeah, okay.

85
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,184
Man, psycho camp.

86
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:17,519
Sucks, dude.

87
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:21,022
More shrinks. Waste of time.

88
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:30,407
Dude.

89
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:32,909
What?

90
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:34,536
Stop staring at your drawings.

91
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:36,079
You're freaking me out.

92
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,833
You think I'm crazy too, don't you?

93
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:41,668
Batshit.

94
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,801
... driving us apart.

95
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:54,890
I'm just asking... 

96
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,058
We need help. We both need help.

97
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:58,602
We are falling apart.

98
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,270
I love him so much... 

99
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:04,107
... and I just can't stand
to see him like this.

100
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:06,943
He was such a happy kid.

101
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,756
No more dreams.

102
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:30,258
Just one night of sleep.

103
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:53,114
You have nothing to be
afraid of, my friend.

104
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:56,743
Death is not far away.

105
00:10:57,452 --> 00:11:00,413
You want to know what's
on the other side?

106
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:03,124
Can you see it?

107
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,087
Of course you can't.

108
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:09,422
Because nothing is there.

109
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,218
- It's all a lie.
- Go to hell.

110
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:16,012
Been there. Now burn.

111
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,484
We lost.

112
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:32,028
Not while the Tower still stands.

113
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:33,738
Not while you still stand.

114
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:41,871
Don't let him get into your head.

115
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:43,832
Gunslingers.

116
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:48,545
I do not aim with my hand.

117
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,673
- He who aims with his hand... 
- Has forgotten the face of his father.

118
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,240
I aim with my eye.

119
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:55,266
Gunslinger, over here.

120
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:58,513
I do not shoot with my hand.

121
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,599
He who shoots with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

122
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,486
- I shoot with my mind.
- Gunslingers.

123
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:07,739
I do not kill with my gun.

124
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:11,443
He who kills with his gun has
forgotten the face of his father.

125
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:13,737
I kill with my heart.

126
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:16,072
Stop breathing.

127
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:19,367
No.

128
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:25,123
Breathe.

129
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,167
Fight it. Fight it!

130
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,054
It never works on you, does it, Roland?

131
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:43,183
The power you have to
resist my magics... 

132
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:46,811
Not forever.

133
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:50,440
Face me!

134
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:52,942
Face me.

135
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,076
The Tower will fall, Roland.

136
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:05,246
Until next time, old friend.

137
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,003
<i>The Man in Black fled
across the desert... </i>

138
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,671
<i>... and the Gunslinger followed.</i>

139
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,387
Holy shit.

140
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:25,058
- Hey.
- This guy, he's some kind of soldier.

141
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,727
He's called a Gunslinger.

142
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,979
And this house, look, it's got a U.S.
mailbox.

143
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,357
- I think it's in New York.
- Timmy, it's 7 a.m.

144
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:33,858
Time to say goodbye.

145
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:36,778
Sorry, got to go. Talk to you later.

146
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,548
The people from the clinic are here.

147
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,758
Now?

148
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,635
I can't... I can't go now.

149
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:02,303
You got to step up, Jake.

150
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,098
If you won't do it for yourself,
then do it for your mom.

151
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,366
- It's in other boys?
- It's common in adolescent boys.

152
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:11,396
There he is.

153
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:13,565
Hi there, Jake.

154
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:15,024
I'm Jill.

155
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:18,027
I'm your intake
administration supervisor.

156
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:20,196
This is Toby, our driver.

157
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:22,073
How's it going, young man?

158
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,533
You pack your things?

159
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,577
What exactly do they do at your clinic?

160
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:28,913
Jake, these guys have been working
with the school for a long time.

161
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,249
No, that's okay, Laurie.
We encourage questions.

162
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,835
It shows spirit and vitality.

163
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,962
He's just a healthy growing boy.

164
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:38,673
I can assure you that all our
tests are done in a controlled... 

165
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,176
... child-friendly environment.

166
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:43,428
We have experience
with cases like yours.

167
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:46,723
Night terrors, hallucinations,
odd obsessions.

168
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,059
Our approach is actually very gentle
compared to standard treatments.

169
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:53,104
I understand your concerns, but
you don't have to worry at all.

170
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,816
Mom, help me pack?

171
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,651
Yeah.

172
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,029
It's two days.

173
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:04,866
Do you want your ripped
jeans or your regular ones?

174
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:07,702
- What's wrong?
- Mom, it's them.

175
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:11,289
- What?
- It's the skin people from my dream.

176
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:18,963
- Honey, you need to stop this.
- No, you have to listen to me.

177
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,381
What's going on?

178
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:23,092
He's not human.

179
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,979
- That's not his real face.
- For chrissake.

180
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:26,070
Shut up, Lon.

181
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,429
You actually hope I'm crazy, just
so you can get me out of here.

182
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:36,189
Mom, you have to believe me.

183
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:40,568
- Lon, maybe this... 
- Can't you see he's gotten worse?

184
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:42,904
You're gonna go with them right now.

185
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:46,574
Or, I swear to God, I will drag
you down the stairs myself.

186
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,212
It's one weekend, kiddo.

187
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:03,258
If you don't like it,
then I'll come get you.

188
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,218
I promise.

189
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,646
<i>Okay, I'll go.</i>

190
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:22,360
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

191
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:41,421
I'm just gonna get my toothbrush.

192
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:51,639
- He's just getting his things.
- He's trying to escape.

193
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:53,433
Escape?

194
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:55,101
Jake?

195
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:56,519
Jake?

196
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:59,605
Chrissake. Jake? Jake!

197
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:00,857
Jake!

198
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:04,527
- Jake!
- Get him.

199
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:10,450
- Come back here!
- Don't worry.

200
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,869
Toby will get him down safely.

201
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:38,394
Stop running.

202
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:33,783
- Mom? You okay?
<i>- Where</i> are you?

203
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,285
You can't just run away like that, Jake.

204
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:38,496
<i>- Please come home.
- Sorry,</i> I <i>can't.</i>

205
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:39,997
<i>Right now.</i>

206
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:41,999
Jake <i>?</i>

207
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,001
I'll call you later.

208
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,045
<i>Love you, Mom.</i>

209
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,650
Greetings, traveler.

210
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,092
<i>Please enter destination.</i>

211
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,352
One, nine.

212
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,022
<i>One, nine, one, nine. Mid-World.</i>

213
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,465
<i>Mid-World. One-way destination.</i>

214
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:40,970
Let me go!

215
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,265
Stop!

216
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,335
What?

217
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,558
Whoa.

218
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,906
<i>Okay... </i>

219
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:44,158
This is good.

220
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:47,119
It's all real.

221
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:58,983
New candidate. Female, age 11.

222
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:02,528
Looks good.

223
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,405
Arriving!

224
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,998
Welcome back, sir.

225
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,960
Find yourself a face, Rat Boy.

226
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:19,962
You're in my house.

227
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:22,047
How was your trip?

228
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:23,883
Fine. Do we have any new leads?

229
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,052
Got it.

230
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,763
What have you got?

231
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,515
These are all showing promise.

232
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,809
Our trackers are going
out to them as we speak.

233
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:35,866
There's been a serious breach of-

234
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:41,776
I'm not fantastic at waiting.

235
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:46,280
Unauthorized crossing, sir.

236
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,699
One of the old portals
on Keystone Earth.

237
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:53,329
Has that ever happened?

238
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,709
Find me a portal close by.

239
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:05,925
- Love your mask.
- Sir?

240
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:09,053
Choose a pretty face and
the world is your oyster.

241
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,638
Aligning, sir.

242
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,023
Who are you?

243
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:05,568
It's you.

244
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:10,447
<i>I'm... I'm Jake.</i>

245
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:12,908
Jake... Jake Chambers.

246
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:15,494
I dreamt about you.

247
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,663
Please.

248
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,084
Here.

249
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:26,797
Look.

250
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:31,427
You're a Gunslinger, right?

251
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:42,229
There are no Gunslingers. Not anymore.

252
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:50,863
- But I saw you.
- Your dreams deceived you, boy.

253
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,490
Told you what you want to hear.

254
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,328
I came a long way to find you.

255
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,538
From another world!

256
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,582
Have a nice trip back.

257
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:08,464
Hey. Wait!

258
00:27:09,465 --> 00:27:11,717
Dude, come on.

259
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:14,303
Look, I saw you.

260
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,556
There was a battlefield, and you were
fighting the Man in Black. And there... 

261
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:20,225
The Man in Black?

262
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:21,852
- No, no, no.
- You know him?

263
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:24,063
- Stop. Please, please, please.
- He sent you.

264
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:25,397
You're one of his tricks.

265
00:27:25,564 --> 00:27:27,816
- No, no, no. I don't know!
- Where is he hiding?!

266
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:30,194
- Where is he hiding?!
- I don't know, I swear!

267
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:32,780
I just... I just saw him in
my dreams, like I saw you!

268
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:35,324
Your name is Roland, right?

269
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,244
Please.

270
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:48,879
When did you first see this?

271
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,256
A year ago.

272
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:54,969
- Who is he?
- He's a sorcerer.

273
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:02,935
In all your visions, Walter is here?

274
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:06,146
- Uh, yeah.
- In this place?

275
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:07,606
Yeah.

276
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,485
Wait, his name's Walter?

277
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:17,908
Cool. Yeah, keep it.

278
00:28:28,377 --> 00:28:29,878
<i>I will</i> find you.

279
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:35,759
There's a tribe beyond that forest.
We'll go there.

280
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,973
They have seers who
will read your visions.

281
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:47,312
Let's go. Keep up... 

282
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:50,733
<i>Okay... </i>

283
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,242
... I went down the slide.

284
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:03,495
Then I got water up my
nose, and I went down... 

285
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:05,262
- ... and I couldn't see anything.
- Hate.

286
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,874
Yeah.

287
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:12,087
Sweetheart? What's wrong?

288
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:58,300
Walter Padick. To what do
we owe this great honor?

289
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:01,428
Someone used a portal
here, in your city... 

290
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:03,764
... without your knowledge.

291
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:06,934
Killed the house demon.

292
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,104
Forgive me, sire.

293
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,232
We'll find out who this
trespasser is and where he went.

294
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,609
Already on it.

295
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,528
Now be a good dog.

296
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:29,832
The blood is human.

297
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:31,959
<i>Boy... </i>

298
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:36,046
His Shine is pure.

299
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:41,510
So that's how he got through.

300
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:43,595
Sir?

301
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:45,806
House demons are formidable beings... 

302
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:49,685
... but a truly powerful
psychic could override it.

303
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:53,522
A boy with the Shine strong
enough to kill a demon?

304
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:55,482
Jackpot.

305
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:59,820
Sayre, didn't two skins have
trouble with a kid yesterday?

306
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:17,546
Don't eat that.

307
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,757
Don't want to have to carry
you for the rest of the way.

308
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,043
Roland?

309
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:16,480
What are they?

310
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:18,023
Taheen.

311
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:19,900
They belong to Walter.

312
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,110
Don't run off in the woods.
It's not safe.

313
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:24,696
But you were the one who ran off.

314
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,573
You said you were hungry.

315
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:32,287
What?

316
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:41,338
You had theme parks here.

317
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:49,263
These ancient structures are
from before the world moved on.

318
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:51,723
No one knows what they are.

319
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:53,684
They're theme parks.

320
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:58,939
I saw you fight him.

321
00:33:02,276 --> 00:33:03,796
There was a field covered with bodies.

322
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:13,745
That was our final stand.

323
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:19,626
I lost my father that day.

324
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,463
You saw that?

325
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,307
Was it about the Tower?

326
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:37,102
The war?

327
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,230
Yes.

328
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:44,359
Now, eat your rabbit.

329
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,452
It's an honor to meet
you in person, sir.

330
00:33:53,618 --> 00:33:54,745
What brings you here?

331
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,079
How may we serve him?

332
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:58,290
Well, I hear you lost a kid.

333
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,918
It... It wasn't our fault.

334
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:05,547
It was as if the child knew what we
were. We're doing everything we can... 

335
00:34:05,714 --> 00:34:08,759
- Name and location.
- It's all in here.

336
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,933
"Jake Chambers."

337
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,730
Now kill... 

338
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:23,106
... each other.

339
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:28,612
Calm down. Enjoy the show, folks.

340
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:31,948
You ain't seen nothing yet.

341
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,502
You draw with a good hand.

342
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:50,717
I don't know what this is.

343
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:56,014
It's a map.

344
00:34:58,392 --> 00:35:01,853
My father showed me a... 
A map like this once.

345
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:10,654
Inside the circle is your
world and my world... 

346
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:12,697
... many others.

347
00:35:12,864 --> 00:35:14,699
No one knows how many.

348
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:19,788
The Dark Tower stands at
the center of all things.

349
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:24,918
And it's stood there from
the beginning of time.

350
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:28,547
And it sends out powerful energy... 

351
00:35:28,713 --> 00:35:31,049
... that protects the universe... 

352
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:33,718
... shields us from what's outside.

353
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:35,470
What do you mean, "outside"?

354
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:37,889
What's outside the universe?

355
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:45,021
Outside is endless darkness... 

356
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:49,192
... full of demons trying to get to us.

357
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:53,655
Walter wants to tear down
the Tower and let them in.

358
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:57,117
When the Tower falls, he'll rule... 

359
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,828
... in a world full of monsters.

360
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:02,831
But you're trying to
stop him, aren't you?

361
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,917
To protect the Tower.

362
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:08,462
I've seen them try to destroy it.

363
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:11,673
- If we could just get there... 
- There is no "we," Jake.

364
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,259
All that matters to me is that I find... 

365
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:16,928
... and kill Walter.

366
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:19,306
That's it.

367
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:03,683
Beamquake.

368
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:05,185
Strong.

369
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:08,063
Sounds like screams.

370
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:19,658
They're just like the
quakes we get back home.

371
00:37:20,408 --> 00:37:23,578
Yeah, what happens in one world... 

372
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,497
... echoes in others.

373
00:37:26,665 --> 00:37:29,000
Hope my mom's okay.

374
00:37:32,462 --> 00:37:34,673
Try to get some sleep.

375
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:39,803
That's not happening.

376
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:48,979
Jake.

377
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:54,192
Jake.

378
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,247
<i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

379
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,377
<i>Where are you?</i>

380
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:29,185
Everyone who walks with you dies.

381
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:40,905
Jake.

382
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,714
Hey, kiddo.

383
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:01,509
Dad?

384
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:04,596
Long time.

385
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:09,934
It's good to see you, man. You got tall.

386
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,604
This isn't real.

387
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,565
- You're... 
- Dead?

388
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:17,692
Not here.

389
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:21,029
I missed you.

390
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:23,073
I missed you too, kiddo.

391
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:25,116
Come on.

392
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:26,493
It's okay.

393
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:31,998
Let's go home.

394
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:39,172
No.

395
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:45,512
Darkness and fire.

396
00:39:50,517 --> 00:39:51,976
Jake!

397
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:53,937
Get away from it!

398
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,958
Roland. My son.

399
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:18,044
Come with me.

400
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:27,220
It's okay.

401
00:40:27,387 --> 00:40:29,222
It's gone.

402
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,059
My dad was in there.

403
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:36,354
No, they sense your weakness... 

404
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:39,065
... create illusions to distract you.

405
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:42,485
That wasn't anybody you know.

406
00:40:43,695 --> 00:40:45,280
I'm sorry.

407
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:52,662
That was just a small tear.

408
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:55,832
They happen after every
attack on the Tower.

409
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:59,836
Those things, they're what's coming
if the Tower falls, aren't they?

410
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:01,045
Yes.

411
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:03,923
But if we find that place where
they're keeping the kids, we could-

412
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:06,050
- Shh, shh, shh.
- What?

413
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:07,886
Something got out.

414
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:18,563
Run! Jake, run!

415
00:42:44,107 --> 00:42:46,067
You're gonna need help.

416
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:47,777
I've hurt worse.

417
00:42:48,403 --> 00:42:50,154
But you're bleeding.

418
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:52,782
I heal fast.

419
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:57,328
You handled yourself well.

420
00:42:57,495 --> 00:43:00,123
That was brave, going for the gun.

421
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:05,044
They're gonna find him, Laurie.

422
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,590
We filled out every form.
They have his picture.

423
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:23,062
I hope you don't mind me
making myself at home.

424
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:25,273
Where I come from, we
don't have chicken.

425
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,984
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, you know me, Lon.

426
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:29,903
You're the one that called me here.

427
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:31,112
Not by the telephone... 

428
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:34,324
... but with your every desire
to get rid of the brat... 

429
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:37,201
... all in the hopes that Mommy
there might love you best.

430
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:41,414
But you'll always be a seat-filler, Lon.

431
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,958
- You get out of here right now.
- Lon.

432
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,712
It's the man from Jake's drawings.

433
00:43:50,924 --> 00:43:52,550
Drawings?

434
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:56,721
Stop breathing.

435
00:43:57,931 --> 00:43:59,515
- Aah!
- Quiet.

436
00:44:02,685 --> 00:44:04,062
Drawings.

437
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:14,364
Show me.

438
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,982
Well, it looks like I've
got myself a stalker.

439
00:45:05,498 --> 00:45:07,375
Gunslinger.

440
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:25,184
This son of yours is
quite special, isn't he?

441
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:40,908
The guilt you must feel... 

442
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,662
... not believing in him.

443
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:49,584
And you sent your only
child off to the asylum.

444
00:45:52,962 --> 00:45:55,089
Shame... 

445
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,092
... on you.

446
00:46:58,486 --> 00:46:59,654
Stranger approaching!

447
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:05,326
Gather round!

448
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:12,166
Long days, pleasant nights.

449
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,293
May you have twice that number.

450
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:18,381
I haven't seen one of your
kind since I was a young man.

451
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,341
Seeing you here, alive... 

452
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:22,426
Who's your strongest seer?

453
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,137
That would be me.

454
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:26,681
I'm Arra.

455
00:47:27,682 --> 00:47:30,184
The boy here has visions of this place.

456
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:33,938
I need to know where it is.

457
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,902
The Man in Black.

458
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:42,238
We managed to do some
serious damage, sir... 

459
00:47:42,386 --> 00:47:44,466
- ... but it didn't fall.
- None of that matters.

460
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,243
I found the one. This kid's going
to bring down the Tower... 

461
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:49,829
... all by his lonesome.

462
00:47:50,288 --> 00:47:52,456
- Where is this child?
- He's here... 

463
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:54,250
... on Mid-World... 

464
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:58,087
... looking for an old friend
of mine, Roland of Eld.

465
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:01,340
Wait, I thought all the
Gunslingers were dead.

466
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:04,091
Roland's always had an
annoying ability... 

467
00:48:04,177 --> 00:48:06,179
... to resist my magics.

468
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,431
So I killed everyone
he ever cared about.

469
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:12,059
Last I heard, he was roaming
the Mohaine aimlessly.

470
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:14,786
- That's where the boy is going.
- Mohaine Desert? Isn't that... ?

471
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,148
Vast. Yes. And so is this boy's Shine.

472
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:20,234
I'll send our trackers
in the region, sir.

473
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:33,206
This will get worse.

474
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:36,209
I don't have anything
that can help with that.

475
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,002
You need to rest, let it heal.

476
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,379
<i>I'll</i> be fine.

477
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:44,175
Thankee, Sai.

478
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:46,582
You've come all the way from
Keystone Earth to find him.

479
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,891
His Shine is beyond
anything I've ever seen.

480
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:54,727
Shine?

481
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:56,062
Psychic powers.

482
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:59,023
Very few are born with this gift.

483
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:03,236
Often, the power is so slight,
people don't even know they have it.

484
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:07,615
<i>Your Shine burns so brightly, Jake.</i>

485
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:11,702
<i>You have potential I can't
even begin to understand.</i>

486
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:13,037
Whoa.

487
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,375
Her voice was in my head.

488
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:20,294
Your gift is extraordinary, Jake.

489
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:23,673
It made you see across worlds.

490
00:49:25,258 --> 00:49:26,717
The drawing.

491
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:28,302
What about the drawing?

492
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,808
Concentrate.

493
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:36,727
Share your visions with me.

494
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,486
Open up.

495
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:49,365
<i>Show me.</i>

496
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:57,039
<i>The Man in Black... </i>

497
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,416
Jake.

498
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,501
<i>Fled across the desert.</i>

499
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:05,798
Tell me.

500
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:07,633
Where is he?

501
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,553
Northern Wastelands.

502
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,601
That's more than six months of travel.

503
00:50:19,562 --> 00:50:21,522
But you can get me there
faster than that.

504
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:24,525
The Man in Black and his men
keep track of all portal travel.

505
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:27,528
- I need to get there.
- Portals.

506
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,947
We couldn't help you,
even if we wanted to.

507
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:33,784
The only way to access their territories
is from one of their own bases.

508
00:50:36,162 --> 00:50:38,289
Then I'll make it on foot.

509
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:40,166
Wait.

510
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,961
The fake-skins... 

511
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:47,006
... they take kids from
different worlds, right?

512
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:48,716
They tried to take me from New York.

513
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:51,969
- Doesn't that mean that they... ?
- They have a base there.

514
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:55,848
With a portal that can take
me right to this place.

515
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,020
You're gonna send us to Keystone Earth.

516
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,407
We're diverting power to the generators.

517
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:15,618
The portal will be ready shortly.

518
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:20,664
Do they have guns in your world?

519
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:22,958
Yeah.

520
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:26,921
And bullets, are they as
rare as they are here?

521
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:30,132
You're gonna like Earth. A lot.

522
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,518
We agreed we'd never use the portal
unless the village was in danger.

523
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:42,478
They will find out we have it and come.

524
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:45,815
We can't disobey a Gunslinger.
It's the law.

525
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,609
- How do you know what he is?
- Arra.

526
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:49,985
You must have read him.

527
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:52,655
What do you see?

528
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:58,452
He's Roland of Gilead.

529
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,121
Last of the line of Eld.

530
00:52:05,668 --> 00:52:09,046
But the Man in Black has
his soul in his pocket... 

531
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:13,300
... and his heart's
consumed by vengeance.

532
00:52:14,135 --> 00:52:15,719
He's not a Gunslinger.

533
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,681
Not anymore.

534
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:21,934
Or would you tell us differently?

535
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,980
Only a goat would lie to a seer.

536
00:52:26,147 --> 00:52:28,232
You dishonor your ancestors.

537
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:30,693
The Gunslingers have sworn an
oath to defend the Tower... 

538
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,528
Look around you.

539
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,239
The war is over, and we lost.

540
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:42,246
If you left your little haven,
you would see that for yourself.

541
00:52:42,997 --> 00:52:45,708
The darkness is everywhere... 

542
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,085
... and trying to fight against
it accomplishes nothing.

543
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,257
I was fighting to defend the Tower
before most of you were even born.

544
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:55,676
There's always a battle.

545
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,386
Always.

546
00:52:57,845 --> 00:52:59,054
But no more.

547
00:53:00,473 --> 00:53:02,433
Isn't that why we're losing?

548
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,352
Because everyone stopped believing.

549
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,483
As long as the darkness is out
there, the Tower will fall.

550
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,236
And before that happens,
I will get my revenge.

551
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:33,881
Look.

552
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:36,008
He saved my life.

553
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,095
And he doesn't even like me that much.

554
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:44,683
He's still a Gunslinger.

555
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,728
I know he is.

556
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:53,484
Should be ready anytime now.

557
00:53:53,651 --> 00:53:55,319
As soon as it aligns, it should open... 

558
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:57,696
... in an unobstructed
area in your city... 

559
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,823
... on your version of Earth.

560
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,283
"Should"?

561
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,910
Technology's very old.

562
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:05,663
Remember that number.
It's your way back here.

563
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:07,248
Got it.

564
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:08,958
Been there.

565
00:54:14,672 --> 00:54:15,714
Hey.

566
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:18,425
You Okay?

567
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:25,432
What's wrong?

568
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,297
We're losing power.

569
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:02,219
Sir, they're in the village.

570
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:18,736
Oh, no. Faras.

571
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:21,322
- Can you fix it?
- We have spare parts in the village.

572
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:28,120
Jake, go find somewhere
close to hide, understand?

573
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:29,663
Yeah.

574
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:47,348
Come on!

575
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:48,849
Get inside!

576
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:51,602
- We need to go! Hurry!
- Are you okay?

577
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,272
Go get weapons!

578
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:58,233
Which way?

579
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,235
In there.

580
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,613
He's there.

581
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:05,574
He's hurt.

582
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:08,160
My child! Please!

583
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:12,122
His guns are forged from the steel... 

584
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:14,667
<i>... of the sword of Arthur Eld himself.</i>

585
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:19,630
I believe Keystoners call it Excalibur.

586
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:30,307
Please, just go!

587
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,354
Just get help, please!

588
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:43,843
- We have to get out of here.
- No, I've got to get them out!

589
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,869
No, no, please, we have to go!

590
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:48,409
- Ahh!
- Run.

591
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:53,122
- Let's go!
- Help!

592
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:54,748
Go get the parts.

593
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:56,041
Dad!

594
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:07,124
They were after our boy.

595
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:08,637
Why would they want our boy?

596
00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:45,758
Right.

597
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:49,219
- Turn on the water pumps.
- Right away, sir.

598
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:51,146
- No!
- Let's try to get them out!

599
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:55,184
- Okay, <i>I'll</i> take care of you!
- All right.

600
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,978
There you are. All right?

601
00:57:58,145 --> 00:57:59,730
Come this way.

602
00:58:14,787 --> 00:58:17,498
You couldn't save him, Roland.

603
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:24,713
Sir, Shine.

604
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,590
That's the boy. Get him.

605
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:34,014
Jake.

606
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:45,609
Jake.

607
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:48,445
- They're here for him.
- I know.

608
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,535
Roland.

609
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,996
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.

610
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:30,153
Roland. Please. Help me, please.

611
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:11,945
Let's go! Let's go!

612
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:13,614
We need to leave.

613
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,990
He's not safe here.

614
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:17,826
And as long as he's here,
you aren't either.

615
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,077
We have this fight.

616
01:00:20,203 --> 01:00:22,539
- Come on.
- Go.

617
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:24,541
Jake.

618
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,002
Be careful using the Shine.
They're tracking you.

619
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,431
<i>Portal alignment complete.</i>

620
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:32,799
Come on.

621
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,514
No, it's not ready yet.

622
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:52,486
- Knife.
- He's a chef.

623
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,696
Come on.

624
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:07,751
So many people.

625
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,637
We need to get you help. Right now.

626
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,396
They had a portal.

627
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:30,273
I think they're gone.

628
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:48,709
Get me the coordinates.

629
01:01:52,587 --> 01:01:56,466
One last time around
the wheel, old friend.

630
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:02,597
This is madness.

631
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:05,267
You can't walk into a
hospital here carrying guns.

632
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:07,602
Trust me. Come on.

633
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:12,774
Let me do all the talking.

634
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:18,214
<i>Hi. You've reached Laurie, Lon and Jake.</i>

635
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,598
<i>Please leave a detailed message... </i>

636
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,409
<i>... and we'll get back to
you as soon as possible.</i>

637
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:24,369
This is awful. Try it.

638
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:27,176
<i>- That looks gross. What is it?
- You got to try it. It's terrible.</i>

639
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:28,987
<i>I don't want to try it if it's terrible.</i>

640
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,107
<i>It's like mango... </i>

641
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,961
Do the animals here still speak?

642
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:36,173
What? No, that's a commercial.

643
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:41,887
Wait, what do you mean by "still"?

644
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,805
He's in here.

645
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:45,223
Mr. Deschain.

646
01:02:46,224 --> 01:02:48,143
I see the antibiotics are kicking in.

647
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,229
On a scale of one to 10,
how bad is your pain?

648
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,566
<i>Okay... </i>

649
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,110
You were in very bad shape.

650
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:59,071
I'm surprised you're even sitting up.

651
01:02:59,237 --> 01:03:00,697
I'm stronger than most.

652
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,201
We get that sentiment a lot.

653
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:07,287
So aside from your infection
and the wound from the... 

654
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:09,456
... costume-party incident... 

655
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:13,960
... we also found traces of
hepatitis A, B, E, and... 

656
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:18,173
... chronic radiation sickness.

657
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,844
Have you traveled overseas in
the past couple of months?

658
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:31,645
No. I've been here on Keystone Earth.

659
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:36,650
So am I cured or not?

660
01:03:36,777 --> 01:03:39,497
We're going to keep you here for the
night to monitor your progress.

661
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:41,488
Maybe tomorrow afternoon... 
What are you doing? No.

662
01:03:41,655 --> 01:03:43,466
- I can't stay here.
- You need to get back on that.

663
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,325
- Mr. Deschain, you need... 
- For your services.

664
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,327
- Wait, what?
- May your days be long.

665
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,079
But you need to get back on that.

666
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:50,789
- Mr. Deschain?
- Bring my guns.

667
01:03:52,582 --> 01:03:54,459
These are painkillers and vitamins.

668
01:03:56,711 --> 01:03:59,548
You only want to take one or two at a... 

669
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:03,051
- ... time.
- Hey, cutie.

670
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:04,553
Can we join the party?

671
01:04:06,263 --> 01:04:09,182
You have both forgotten the
faces of your fathers.

672
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:13,311
You probably shouldn't
talk to people here.

673
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:25,240
What is this?

674
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:26,950
<i>Sugar.</i>

675
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:31,913
How we gonna find the portal?
New York's a pretty big place.

676
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,290
I don't know.

677
01:04:33,456 --> 01:04:37,002
I just can't let Walter know
how I'm coming for him.

678
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:47,470
I've got an idea.

679
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:53,727
These painkillers work fast.

680
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:55,854
I haven't felt this good in years.

681
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:57,772
Yeah, we got the good stuff.

682
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:00,901
Got any more of that sugar?

683
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:04,070
There's nothing to be scared of.

684
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,865
I promise you, whatever happens... 

685
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:09,034
... you'll be at peace.

686
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:12,204
- You'll be... 
- A seer who lies.

687
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:15,457
The worst kind.

688
01:05:17,626 --> 01:05:19,836
I like you already.

689
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:22,714
Come now.

690
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:25,550
Good bye.

691
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:29,012
Talk.

692
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:32,599
Shh.

693
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:36,853
Don't fight it. Where
did he take the boy?

694
01:05:38,563 --> 01:05:39,606
Jake?

695
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:41,816
Chambers, yes. Where?

696
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:50,492
- Key... Key... 
- Keystone Earth.

697
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:51,701
Thank you.

698
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,838
Hey, remember me?

699
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,261
You said they were crossing over kids.

700
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:12,555
You were one of them, weren't you?

701
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,268
I lost it. The Shine.

702
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,834
Which way did they take you through?

703
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:21,690
- No, no, you have to run.
- Do you remember? A portal, a door.

704
01:06:21,856 --> 01:06:23,733
- Anything, please.
- It's almost over.

705
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,110
It's almost over.

706
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:27,070
It's almost over. It's almost over.

707
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:29,698
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

708
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:31,658
<i>Remember. Show me.</i>

709
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:36,371
<i>Dixie.</i>

710
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:37,789
Jake!

711
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:40,667
Jake!

712
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,962
They can track the Shine.

713
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:45,672
Okay?

714
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:51,094
I know what you are.

715
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:54,389
Gunslinger.

716
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:57,142
Go.

717
01:07:02,188 --> 01:07:05,358
Should have enough to find it. Got
to get home and do some research.

718
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:06,698
Your home?

719
01:07:06,778 --> 01:07:08,969
Yeah, I got to let my mom know I'm okay.

720
01:07:09,654 --> 01:07:11,694
<i>We have trackers spread
throughout the city.</i>

721
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:13,366
There's no trace of him yet, sir.

722
01:07:13,533 --> 01:07:15,660
Couple of small spikes, but
not enough to hone in on.

723
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:17,037
Don't you worry, Dicky-boy.

724
01:07:17,203 --> 01:07:18,913
- I've got you covered.
- Sir?

725
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,250
I left a surprise for our little friend.
Just be ready.

726
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:25,170
- You should probably wait here.
- Dude.

727
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:27,422
- Where the hell have you been?
- Timmy. Um... 

728
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:28,715
Who's that?

729
01:07:30,216 --> 01:07:31,509
I'll tell you later.

730
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:34,095
How's Mom and Lon? They
must be freaking out.

731
01:07:34,387 --> 01:07:36,181
They haven't been home since yesterday.

732
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:40,685
Mom.Mom.

733
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:52,405
- Mom?
- Jake.

734
01:07:52,572 --> 01:07:53,865
- Mom? Mom! Mom!
- Jake!

735
01:07:57,619 --> 01:07:59,079
No.

736
01:07:59,537 --> 01:08:00,580
No, no.

737
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:04,542
No, no. No, no, no.

738
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:06,920
No, no, no.

739
01:08:07,587 --> 01:08:09,422
No, Mom. No, no, no.

740
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:12,258
No, no, Mom.

741
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:22,310
No.

742
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:24,938
No, no, Mom.

743
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,398
- Drawings.
- Mom.

744
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:27,732
<i>I'll</i> make it quick.

745
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:29,651
Jake!

746
01:08:32,987 --> 01:08:34,322
No.

747
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:35,782
No, Jake.

748
01:08:36,157 --> 01:08:38,034
- Don't see it.
- Mom.

749
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:40,412
It's what he wants.

750
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:44,124
- He's tracking you.
- She's dead.

751
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,417
Close your mind.

752
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:49,045
Close your mind. Let the
pain run through you, Jake.

753
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:51,214
He killed her.

754
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:54,050
- I know. I know.
- He killed her.

755
01:08:58,388 --> 01:08:59,889
Come here.

756
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:32,672
I will kill him.

757
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:35,508
For both of us.

758
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:45,435
What about the Tower?

759
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:54,569
My mom died so you could
have your revenge?

760
01:09:58,823 --> 01:10:01,493
Maybe your world is almost
gone, but mine isn't.

761
01:10:01,659 --> 01:10:04,454
You said it yourself, as long
as the darkness is out there... 

762
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:07,123
... the Tower's always in danger.

763
01:10:10,877 --> 01:10:12,921
You know, they were right.

764
01:10:15,882 --> 01:10:18,051
You're not a Gunslinger.

765
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:23,848
Here.

766
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:26,267
It's called the Dixie Pig.

767
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,061
It's on Plymouth and Pearl.

768
01:10:43,993 --> 01:10:46,079
When I was younger... 

769
01:10:47,914 --> 01:10:50,667
... I would recite the
Gunslinger's Creed.

770
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,797
It calms the heart and the mind.

771
01:10:57,507 --> 01:10:59,968
I haven't spoken it for years.

772
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:25,827
I do not aim with my hand.

773
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:30,039
He who aims with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

774
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:33,042
I aim with my eye.

775
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:38,798
I do not shoot with my hand.

776
01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:42,927
He who shoots with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

777
01:11:43,094 --> 01:11:45,096
I shoot with my mind.

778
01:11:58,067 --> 01:12:00,028
I do not kill with my gun.

779
01:12:00,194 --> 01:12:01,840
BOTH He who kills with his gun

780
01:12:01,865 --> 01:12:03,722
has forgotten the face of his father.

781
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:06,117
Not while the Tower still stands.

782
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:07,493
Not while you still stand.

783
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,787
- I kill with my heart.
- I kill with my heart.

784
01:12:19,922 --> 01:12:21,758
That's good.

785
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:24,385
Your Shine is your weapon, Jake.

786
01:12:26,929 --> 01:12:28,931
Guns are mine.

787
01:12:45,406 --> 01:12:47,575
Can I help you fellas?

788
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:50,578
- Hey.
- Forty-five-caliber bullets.

789
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:51,829
Uh... 

790
01:12:52,038 --> 01:12:54,290
- I only have... 
- We'll take them all.

791
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:56,334
Just do what he says. He won't hurt you.

792
01:12:56,501 --> 01:12:57,752
I don't want any trouble.

793
01:12:58,419 --> 01:13:00,088
Well, then you're smarter than most.

794
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:01,756
Hurry up... 

795
01:13:13,184 --> 01:13:15,144
All right, let's get you somewhere safe.

796
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,647
Gunslinger.

797
01:13:20,566 --> 01:13:22,193
Did you miss me?

798
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:27,532
Well, I guess you did.

799
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:29,492
Roland! Roland, Roland.

800
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:30,910
Jake, run.

801
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:32,537
Run!

802
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:45,925
I see you finally found a compass,
yet you still came to me.

803
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:48,845
Because I'm your only
destination, Roland.

804
01:13:51,013 --> 01:13:52,348
Fire away.

805
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,269
It's not me. I'm not doing this.

806
01:13:59,605 --> 01:14:01,482
First, you want to save the Tower.

807
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:04,652
Then, kill the Man in Black.

808
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:12,201
You are like a dog fetching
a stick over and over.

809
01:14:12,368 --> 01:14:14,871
You tell the kid what
happened to the old crew?

810
01:14:15,037 --> 01:14:18,541
You tell him that everyone that
walks with you dies by my hand?

811
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:19,959
Not this time.

812
01:14:20,126 --> 01:14:21,919
Your soft-skinned mother?

813
01:14:22,086 --> 01:14:24,005
- Your Gunslinger friends?
- Face me.

814
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:25,757
Your whimpering excuse for a dad.

815
01:14:25,923 --> 01:14:29,385
Stop hiding behind your
magic and face me, Walter!

816
01:14:31,304 --> 01:14:34,265
We both know that no matter who
crosses the finish line first... 

817
01:14:34,432 --> 01:14:37,435
... the universe will die out eventually.

818
01:14:37,935 --> 01:14:40,188
Death always wins.

819
01:14:40,354 --> 01:14:42,064
That's the deal.

820
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:52,158
No, no.

821
01:14:54,744 --> 01:14:55,787
Roland.

822
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,289
<i>Roland.</i>

823
01:15:19,936 --> 01:15:22,355
Yeah!

824
01:15:29,904 --> 01:15:32,824
Jake Chambers.

825
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:44,836
You are the full package, as advertised.

826
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:49,632
Sayre, get ready.

827
01:15:49,799 --> 01:15:52,844
Tall, dark and handsome is
about to crash the party.

828
01:16:13,573 --> 01:16:15,741
Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

829
01:16:15,908 --> 01:16:16,993
Take one and go.

830
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:26,335
Alrighty. Let's go put everyone
out of their misery, shall we?

831
01:16:26,502 --> 01:16:28,087
Any time, champ.

832
01:16:46,063 --> 01:16:47,398
Roland.

833
01:16:55,281 --> 01:16:56,824
<i>Roland... </i>

834
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:58,784
<i>... they're taking me to that place.</i>

835
01:16:58,951 --> 01:17:00,453
<i>Be careful.</i>

836
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,787
Hang on.

837
01:17:01,954 --> 01:17:03,372
I'm coming for you.

838
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:19,847
We'll get him, sir.

839
01:17:20,222 --> 01:17:21,432
Bye.

840
01:17:23,851 --> 01:17:25,937
Have a great apocalypse.

841
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:30,274
Close in on him!

842
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:35,446
<i>Okay... </i>

843
01:17:50,544 --> 01:17:51,754
- Let's go.
- Sir.

844
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:53,798
We're online!

845
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:06,185
- It's really gonna happen, isn't it?
- Oh, yes, it is.

846
01:19:22,803 --> 01:19:24,847
Something's wrong.

847
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:29,810
Something's wrong here. The
levels are plateauing.

848
01:19:29,977 --> 01:19:31,979
- It's as if he's... 
- Fighting back.

849
01:19:34,148 --> 01:19:36,400
Why do you resist?

850
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:39,007
Your visions didn't bring you
to him, they brought you to me.

851
01:19:39,695 --> 01:19:41,495
He doesn't love you. He
doesn't care for you.

852
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,992
In fact, he's been using you
this entire time to get to me.

853
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:48,287
This is why you're here.
This is your destiny.

854
01:19:48,454 --> 01:19:50,456
You killed my mom!

855
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:52,583
Yes, that's it. There we go.

856
01:20:52,017 --> 01:20:53,727
Portal. Close it.

857
01:20:56,522 --> 01:20:58,440
- Close it!
- I can't!

858
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:01,944
Wait.

859
01:21:04,071 --> 01:21:06,490
Oh, my God. It's the kid.

860
01:21:06,657 --> 01:21:09,493
It's the kid! He's
keeping the portal open!

861
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:13,289
Ahh. Impressive.

862
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:22,089
So you wanted me to
face you, old friend?

863
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:25,801
Here I am.

864
01:22:15,809 --> 01:22:18,979
It's fitting that you and the
Tower should fall together.

865
01:23:10,406 --> 01:23:11,448
Roland.

866
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:16,370
<i>Roland, get up.</i>

867
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:24,211
<i>I do not aim with my hand.</i>

868
01:23:24,378 --> 01:23:27,965
<i>He who aims with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.</i>

869
01:23:28,757 --> 01:23:30,259
<i>I aim with my eye.</i>

870
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:37,725
<i>I do not shoot with my hand.</i>

871
01:23:37,891 --> 01:23:39,518
<i>He who shoots with his hand... </i>

872
01:23:39,685 --> 01:23:42,563
Has forgotten the face of his father.

873
01:23:43,731 --> 01:23:44,940
<i>I shoot with my mind.</i>

874
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:47,026
I shoot with my mind.

875
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,696
<i>I do not kill with my gun.</i>

876
01:23:52,489 --> 01:23:54,616
He who kills with his gun... 

877
01:23:54,783 --> 01:23:56,503
<i>Has forgotten the face of his father.</i>

878
01:23:56,577 --> 01:23:59,330
Has forgotten the face of his father.

879
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:06,837
I kill with my heart.

880
01:25:46,812 --> 01:25:48,230
Mom, Dad.

881
01:25:48,397 --> 01:25:49,898
- There they are.
- Sweetheart.

882
01:25:50,065 --> 01:25:52,025
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

883
01:25:58,755 --> 01:26:00,262
Multiple witnesses saw... 

884
01:26:00,287 --> 01:26:01,886
<i>... the strange phenomena in the sky.</i>

885
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,510
<i>Looks like we've seen the worst of it... </i>

886
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,812
The weather center has now
<i>issued</i> a statement... 

887
01:26:05,836 --> 01:26:08,714
<i>... that it may have been some
kind of very intense solar flare.</i>

888
01:26:11,295 --> 01:26:13,297
- Here.
- What is this?

889
01:26:13,464 --> 01:26:15,716
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Hot dog.

890
01:26:15,883 --> 01:26:17,676
Savages.

891
01:26:19,595 --> 01:26:20,679
What breed?

892
01:26:20,846 --> 01:26:22,431
No, it's not a breed.

893
01:26:30,189 --> 01:26:31,815
I have to leave here, Jake.

894
01:26:33,192 --> 01:26:35,360
You understand that, don't you?

895
01:26:36,403 --> 01:26:37,863
I know.

896
01:26:45,245 --> 01:26:46,580
Why don't you come with me?

897
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:53,086
Really?

898
01:26:54,046 --> 01:26:55,923
You have nothing here.

899
01:26:56,089 --> 01:26:59,051
Besides, I could use your help.

900
01:26:59,343 --> 01:27:00,844
Uh... 

901
01:27:01,553 --> 01:27:03,430
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

902
01:27:04,264 --> 01:27:05,641
Gunslinger.

903
