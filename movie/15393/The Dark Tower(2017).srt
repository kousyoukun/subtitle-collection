1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:10,000

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,100
宇宙中心的矗立着一座塔 保护宇宙防止黑暗力量侵袭

6
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,300
据说某位儿童的灵知之力能摧毁这座塔

7
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,600
黑 暗 塔

8
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,780
来和我们一起玩吧 快来呀
Come and play with us. Come and play.

9
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,120
- 你抓不到我  - 想得美
- Not gonna get me!  - You wish!

10
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,690
- 杰克  - 妈妈 你还好吗？
- Jake.  - Mom, you okay?

11
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,360
刚刚那次地震可真不小
That was a big one.

12
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,200
又做噩梦了？
Bad dreams?

13
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,410
没有
No.

14
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,160
来吧 去吃早饭
Come on. Get breakfast.

15
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,470
今早的地震给上班族带来了不小的麻烦
This morning's quake is causing major problems for commuters.

16
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,680
纽约今早遭遇五点七级地震
The 5.7-magnitude quake hit New York early this morning.

17
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,190
然而太平洋两岸也受到一系列地震袭扰
Yet another in a series of quakes that has rattled both coasts.

18
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,060
东京再次发生地震 再加上上周的柏林地震…
Tokyo was hit again. And with the Berlin quake last week...

19
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,280
问题就来了 是什么引起了这些地震？
Question is: What is causing all these earthquakes?

20
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,740
天哪 现在连体育娱乐频道也在报道地震了
Christ, even ESPN's doing the quakes now.

21
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,570
但目前地震原因尚不清楚
But we still don't know what's causing them.

22
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,280
嗨 我爸妈让我过来看看…
Hey. My folks sent me over to see...

23
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,330
- …你们是不是还活着  - 我们很好 蒂米
- ...if you guys are still alive.  - We're fine, Timmy.

24
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,950
那地震可真够强的
That was pretty intense.

25
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,500
- 是啊  - 你还好吧？
- Yeah.  - You good?

26
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,880
- 还好  - 我们迟会到
- Yeah.  - We're just running a little late.

27
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,170
- 一会见？ - 替我跟你妈妈问个好
- See you later?  - Say hi to your mom for me.

28
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,210
妈妈 劳里跟你问好
Ma, Laurie says hi.

29
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,470
别忘了 你下课后要去见霍奇基斯博士
Don't forget, you have Dr. Hotchkiss after school.

30
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,520
我们找这些心理医生根本就是浪费钱
We're wasting money on all those shrinks.

31
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,690
他已经好些了
He's making progress.

32
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,260
等一下
Wait up!

33
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,260
嘿 你从我的存物柜里拿了那些书吗？
Hey, did you get the books from my locker?

34
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,720
所以你说世界末日什么时候到来呢？
So when's the apocalypse coming?

35
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,100
拜托了 你就把书还给我吧
Come on, man, just give me my book.

36
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,390
- 怎么 你吃的药不管用了？ - 嘿 嘿
- What's wrong, your meds stop working?  - Hey! Hey!

37
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,310
- 把书还给我  - 你先下去
- Give me my book!  - Get off me!

38
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,190
- 下去  - 嘿
- Get off of me.  - Hey!

39
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
嘿 够了 钱伯斯
Hey. That is enough, Chambers.

40
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,360
把书还给我
I need my book.

41
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,030
嘿 你得回家冷静冷静
Hey. You need to go home and cool off.

42
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,250
你最近 一直挺忙的啊 杰克
You've been, uh, quite busy, Jake.

43
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,670
你觉得最近的这些地震…
This big tower in the clouds you keep dreaming about...

44
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,180
…与经常在你梦里出现的那个云雾缭绕的高塔有关
...you say these earthquakes we've been having have something to do with it.

45
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,520
发生地震是因为那座塔在遭受袭击
They happen because the Tower is under attack.

46
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,480
你是个聪明孩子 杰克
You're a smart kid, Jake.

47
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,150
你要明白当你无法…
You know when you can't differentiate...

48
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,820
- …区分梦境与现实的时候…  - 那不是梦
- ...between dreams and reality...  - It's not a dream.

49
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,110
好吗？我不是疯子
Okay? I'm not crazy.

50
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,740
我一直看到同样的事物
I always see the same thing.

51
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,660
黑暗塔 黑衣人 还有穿着蒙面的怪人
The Tower, the Man in Black, the creepy guys with the fake skins.

52
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,420
如果那座塔被摧毁了会怎样？
What if the Tower were destroyed?

53
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,290
世界会陷入无尽的黑暗和烈火之中
Darkness and fire.

54
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,380
我们来谈谈你的父亲
Let's talk about your dad.

55
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,680
又谈这个
Surprise.

56
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,100
你失去了父亲 你的世界崩塌了
When you lost your father, your world fell apart.

57
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,390
你之所以出现末日迫近的幻觉…
You have these visions of impending hell on Earth...

58
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,730
…正是因为这恰恰是你内心的感受
...because that's how you feel inside.

59
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,480
即便是“黑暗”和“烈火”这些字眼…
Even words like "darkness" and "fire"...

60
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,360
…杰克啊 你也是在描述你父亲牺牲的那晚
...Jake, you're describing the night your father died.

61
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,910
肯定没这么简单
Can't just be about that.

62
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,570
杰克 那只是梦而已
They're just dreams, Jake.

63
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,490
不是真的
They're not real.

64
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,440
一定要小心
Watch out.

65
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,360
他们会把你抓走
They'll take you.

66
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,730
他们专抓像你这样的孩子
They steal kids like you.

67
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,240
快到路对面去
Cross them over.

68
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,530
你们与众不同
Special ones.

69
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,990
他们想控制你们的头脑
The power of your mind, that's what they want.

70
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,680
杰克 你没事吧？
Jake. What's up?

71
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,770
今天诸事不顺么？
Bad day?

72
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,390
是
Yeah.

73
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,140
走吧
Let's go.

74
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,730
- 想一块出去玩吗？ - 好啊
- Want to hang out?  - Yeah.

75
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,270
…控制 他状况很不稳定 我们就接受提议吧
...control, he's unstable. We need to take the offer.

76
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,280
- 这是免费接受高水平治疗的好机会  - 这不是钱的问题
- It's great treatment for no money.  - It's not about the money.

77
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,690
- 我在你房间里等着  - 我们现在…
- I'll wait in your room.  - There's nothing more...

78
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,110
- …已经帮不了他了  - 天哪 朗
- ...we can do for him now.  - Jesus, Lon!

79
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,240
你至少得装出一副把他当作亲生儿子的样子吧？
Can you at least pretend like he's your own kid?

80
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,000
抱歉 宝贝 我们… 我们没听到你进来
I'm sorry, baby, we...  We didn't hear you come in.

81
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,120
今天在学校 到底是怎么回事？
What the hell happened in school today?

82
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,710
你答应过我 不去惹事的
You promised me you're gonna stay out of trouble.

83
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,630
对不起 妈妈
Sorry, Mom.

84
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,920
亲爱的 嗯…
Honey, um...

85
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,550
…州北有一个诊所联系了你们学校
...the school's been approached by a clinic upstate.

86
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,550
他们专门帮助…
They work with kids who...

87
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,350
正处在困难时期的孩子
Who are having a hard time.

88
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,230
这个周末有一个开放参观机会
There's an opening this weekend.

89
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,770
应该是个不错的地方
It's supposed to be a great place.

90
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,310
做的研究都很科学 能做脑部扫描 还有睡眠模式研究
It's science-based: brain scans, sleep patterns.

91
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,280
- 我觉得能…  - 行 好吧
- I think it could...  - Yeah, okay.

92
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,410
伙计 那可就是疯人院啊
Man, psycho camp.

93
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,740
肯定糟透了 哥们
Sucks, dude.

94
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,240
更多的心理医生 只会浪费更多时间
More shrinks. Waste of time.

95
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,630
哥们
Dude.

96
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,130
怎么了？
What?

97
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,760
别再盯着你那些画了
Stop staring at your drawings.

98
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,300
你真是把我吓坏了
You're freaking me out.

99
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,060
你也以为我疯了 是吧？
You think I'm crazy too, don't you?

100
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,890
胡说
Batshit.

101
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,020
…我们之间越来越生疏
...driving us apart.

102
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,110
我只是在请求…
I'm just asking...

103
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
我们需要帮助 我们俩都需要
We need help. We both need help.

104
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,820
我们撑不下去了
We are falling apart.

105
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,490
我非常爱他…
I love him so much...

106
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,330
…我不能再看着他这么下去了
...and I just can't stand to see him like this.

107
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,170
他曾经多么无忧无虑
He was such a happy kid.

108
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,980
不要再做梦了
No more dreams.

109
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,480
就只静静地睡一晚
Just one night of sleep.

110
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,340
我的朋友 你不用害怕
You have nothing to be afraid of, my friend.

111
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,970
死亡并不遥远
Death is not far away.

112
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,640
想知道世界另一边都有什么吗？
You want to know what's on the other side?

113
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,350
你能看到吗？
Can you see it?

114
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,310
当然不能
Of course you can't.

115
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,640
因为那里什么都没有
Because nothing is there.

116
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,440
- 天堂地狱的那一套都是谎言  - 你下地狱吧
- It's all a lie.  - Go to hell.

117
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,230
我早去过地狱了 现在燃烧吧
Been there. Now burn.

118
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,710
我们失败了
We lost.

119
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,250
不 枪侠不倒
Not while the Tower still stands.

120
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,960
塔就不倒
Not while you still stand.

121
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,090
别让他进入你的头脑中
Don't let him get into your head.

122
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,050
两位枪侠
Gunslingers.

123
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,770
枪准不在于双手
I do not aim with my hand.

124
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,900
- 违此者…  - 忘祖也
- He who aims with his hand...  - Has forgotten the face of his father.

125
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,270
枪准在于双眼
I aim with my eye.

126
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
枪侠 我在这儿呢
Gunslinger, over here.

127
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,740
枪准不在于双手
I do not shoot with my hand.

128
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,820
违此者 忘祖也
He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.

129
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,700
- 枪准在于头脑  - 枪侠
- I shoot with my mind.  - Gunslingers.

130
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,450
枪准不在于所用之枪
I do not kill with my gun.

131
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,670
违此者 忘祖也
He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.

132
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,960
枪准在于我的心
I kill with my heart.

133
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,290
停止呼吸
Stop breathing.

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,590
不
No.

135
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,350
吸气
Breathe.

136
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,390
用力反抗 不要放弃
Fight it. Fight it!

137
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,280
这招对你从不管用 是吧 罗兰？
It never works on you, does it, Roland?

138
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,410
你这种抗拒我法力的能力…
The power you have to resist my magics...

139
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,030
只是暂时的
Not forever.

140
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,660
你转过身来
Face me!

141
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,160

280
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,160
在你所看到的那些幻象中 沃特也在这里？
In all your visions, Walter is here?

281
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,370
- 呃，是  - 就在这里？
- Uh, yeah.  - In this place?

282
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,830
是的
Yeah.

283
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,710
等一下 他叫沃特？
Wait, his name's Walter?

284
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,130
酷极了 那个送你了
Cool. Yeah, keep it.

285
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,100
我一定会找到你的
I will find you.

286
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,980
那边的森林里有一个村落 我们就去那里吧
There's a tribe beyond that forest. We'll go there.

287
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,200
那里的预言家可以读到你看到的东西
They have seers who will read your visions.

288
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,530
走吧 快跟上…
Let's go. Keep Up...

289
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,960
好吧…
Okay...

290
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,460
…我从滑梯上滑下来
...I went down the slide.

291
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,720
接着我洗了我的鼻子 再去滑滑梯
Then I got water up my nose, and I went down...

292
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,430
- …我什么都看不到  - 仇恨
- ...and I couldn't see anything.  - Hate.

293
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,100
好吧
Yeah.

294
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,310
宝贝 怎么了？
Sweetheart? What's wrong?

295
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,520
沃特·帕蒂可 您怎么大驾光临了？
Walter Padick. To what do we owe this great honor?

296
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,650
在你的城市里 有人未经过你的允许
Someone used a portal here, in your city...

297
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,990
…使用了通道
...without your knowledge.

298
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,160
还杀掉了守护恶魔
Killed the house demon.

299
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,330
不好意思 先生
Forgive me, sire.

300
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,450
我们会找到他的
We'll find out who this trespasser is and where he went.

301
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,830
已经在找了
Already on it.

302
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,750
试试看这个
Now be a good dog.

303
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,050
这是人类的血
The blood is human.

304
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,180
小男孩…
BOY...

305
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,270
他的灵力很纯洁
His Shine is pure.

306
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,730
所以他才能进入通道
So that's how he got through.

307
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,820
先生？
Sir?

308
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,030
守护恶魔是非常可怕的生物…
House demons are formidable beings...

309
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,910
但是灵力强大的人能制服它们
...but a truly powerful psychic could override it.

310
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,740
这男孩灵力强大到可以杀死一个恶魔？
A boy with the Shine strong enough to kill a demon?

311
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,700
我们这是中头彩了啊
Jackpot

312
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:00,040
塞尔 两个蒙面人昨天都没搞定一个男孩？
Sayre, didn't two skins have trouble with a kid yesterday?

313
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,770
别吃这个
Don't eat that.

314
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,980
我可不想剩下的路都背着你走
Don't want to have to carry you for the rest of the way.

315
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,270
罗兰
Roland?

316
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,700
他们是什么
What are they?

317
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,250
蒙面人
Taheen.

318
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,120
沃尔特的部下
They belong to Walter.

319
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,330
不要在树林里走 不安全
Don't run off in the woods. It's not safe.

320
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,920
但是刚刚你不是走进树林了嘛
But you were the one who ran off.

321
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,800
因为你说你饿了
You said you were hungry.

322
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,510
好吧
What?

323
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,560
以前这里是个游乐园
You had theme parks here.

324
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,490
这些都是史前的建筑了
These ancient structures are from before the world moved on.

325
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,950
没有人知道它们是什么
No one knows what they are.

326
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,910
他们是主题公园
They're theme parks.

327
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,160
我看到你和他作战
I saw you fight him.

328
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,000
遍地尸体
There was a field covered with bodies.

329
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,970
那是我们的决战
That was our final stand.

330
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,850
那天我的父亲牺牲了
I lost my father that day.

331
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,690
你都看到了？
You saw that?

332
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,530
那场战争
Was it about the Tower?

333
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,320
是不是关于黑暗塔的
The war?

334
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,450
是的
Yes.

335
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,580
继续吃你的兔肉吧
Now, eat your rabbit.

336
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,670
很荣幸见到你 先生
It's an honor to meet you in person, sir.

337
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,970
请问您来这有什么事么？
What brings you here?

338
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,300
有什么可以效劳的？
How may we serve him?

339
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,510
我听说你们没抓住那个孩子
Well, I hear you lost a kid.

340
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,140
这不是我们的错
It... It wasn't our fault.

341
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,770
那个小孩仿佛知道我们的真实身份 我们正在竭尽全力…
It was as if the child knew what we were.We're doing everything we can...

342
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,980
- 告诉我他的名字和位置  - 都在这儿呢
- Name and location.  - It's all in here.

343
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,160
杰克·钱伯斯
"Jake Chambers."

344
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,950
现在
Now kill...

345
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,330
相互厮杀
...each other.

346
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,830
别紧张 好好欣赏吧 各位
Calm down. Enjoy the show, folks.

347
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,170
好戏还在后头呢
You ain't seen nothing yet.

348
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,720
你画的挺不错啊
You draw with a good hand.

349
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,940
我都不知道自己画的是什么
I don't know what this is.

350
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,240
这是幅地图
It's a map.

351
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,080
我父亲曾经给我看过这样的地图
My father showed me a...A map like this once.

352
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,880
在圈子之内 是你我的世界
Inside the circle is your world and my world...

353
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,920
还有更多的世界
...many others.

354
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,920
没人知道具体有多少世界
No one knows how many.

355
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,010
黑暗塔矗立在万物的中央
The Dark Tower stands at the center of all things.

356
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,140
自万物之始 矗立于此
And it's stood there from the beginning of time.

357
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,770
它可以发出强大的能量
And it sends out powerful energy...

358
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,270
这能量保护了宇宙
...that protects the universe...

359
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,940
把我们和外界隔绝开来
...shields us from what's outside.

360
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,690
你说的“外界”是什么意思
What do you mean, "outside"?

361
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,110
宇宙之外有什么？
What's outside the universe?

362
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,240
宇宙之外是一片无尽的黑暗
Outside is endless darkness...

363
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,410
充满了试图接近我们的恶魔
...full of demons trying to get to us.

364
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,880
沃尔特想摧毁黑暗塔 放出恶魔
Walter wants to tear down the Tower and let them in.

365
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,340
如果黑暗塔倾塌 他将主宰全宇宙
When the Tower falls, he'll rule...

366
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,050
怪物将四处横行
...in a world full of monsters.

367
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,050
你是不是要阻止他们
But you're trying to stop him, aren't you?

368
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,140
你在保护黑暗塔
To protect the Tower.

369
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,680
我看到他们试图摧毁黑暗塔
I've seen them try to destroy it.

370
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,900
- 如果我们到达那里…  - 杰克 这只是你的一厢情愿罢了
- If we could just get there...  - There is no "we," Jake.

371
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,480
我一心只想找到
All that matters to me is that I find...

372
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,150
并杀死沃尔特
...and kill Walter.

373
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,530
仅此而已
That's it.

374
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,910
光束震动
Beamquake.

375
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,410
很强烈
Strong.

376
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,290
听起来像是有人在尖叫
Sounds like screams.

377
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,880
这和我老家的几次地震情况相似啊
They're just like the quakes we get back home.

378
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,800
是的 一个世界发生的事
Yeah, what happens in one world...

379
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,720
会影响到其它的世界
...echoes in others.

380
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,220
希望我妈妈没事
Hope my mom's okay.

381
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,900
去睡一会儿吧
Try to get some sleep.

382
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,030
我睡不着
That's not happening.

383
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,200
杰克
Jake.

384
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,410
杰克
Jake.

385
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,470
嘿 我的孩子
Hey, kiddo.

386
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,600
你在哪？
Where are you?

387
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,410
与你同行的人都会死
Everyone who walks with you dies.

388
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,130
杰克
Jake.

389
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,940
嘿 我的孩子
Hey, kiddo.

390
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,730
爸爸？
Dad?

391
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,820
好久不见了
Long time.

392
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,160
很高兴见到你 你长高了
It's good to see you, man. You got tall.

393
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,830
这不是真的
This isn't real.

394
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,790
- 你不是…  - 我还没死呢
- You're...  - Dead?

395
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,910
在这个世界里 我还没死
Not here.

396
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,250
我好想你
I missed you.

397
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,300
我也很想你 我的孩子
I missed you too, kiddo.

398
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,340
过来
Come on.

399
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,720
别害怕
It's okay.

400
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,220
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

401
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,390
不
No.

402
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,730
黑暗和烈火
Darkness and fire.

403
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,200
杰克！
Jake!

404
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,160
离它远点！
Get away from it!

405
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,180
罗兰 我的儿子
Roland. My son.

406
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,270
跟我来
Come with me.

407
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
没事了
It's okay.

408
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,440
它走了
It's gone.

409
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,280
刚才那个是我的爸爸
My dad was in there.

410
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,580
不 他们感知到你的弱点
No, they sense your weakness...

411
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,290
用幻觉来分散你的注意力
...create illusions to distract you.

412
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,710
那不是你所认识的人 杰克
That wasn't anybody you know.

413
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,500
我能体谅你的心情
I'm sorry.

414
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,880
那只是一个小的时空裂缝
That was just a small tear.

415
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,050
每次塔遭受攻击后都会出现这样的裂缝
They happen after every attack on the Tower.

416
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,060
要是黑暗塔被摧毁了 是不是那些怪物就要来了
Those things, they're what's coming if the Tower falls, aren't they?

417
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,270
是的
Yes.

418
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,150
那如果我们找到了那些孩子所在的位置 我们…
But if we find that place where they're keeping the kids, we could...

419
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,270
- 嘘嘘嘘嘘  - 怎么了？
- Shh, shh, shh.  - What?

420
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,110
附近有动静
Something got out.

421
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,790
快跑！杰克 快跑！
Run! Jake, run!

422
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,290
你需要帮助
You're gonna need help.

423
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,000
我还受过更重的伤呢
I've hurt worse.

424
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,380
可是你在流血
But you're bleeding.

425
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,000
我恢复的很快
I heal fast.

426
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,550
你刚才表现不错
You handled yourself well.

427
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,350
敢去拿那把枪 很勇敢
That was brave, going for the gun.

428
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,270
警方会找到他的 劳丽
They're gonna find him, Laurie.

429
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,810
我们填了一大堆表格 提供了他的照片
We filled out every form. They have his picture.

430
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,280
希望你们不要介意 我把这里当做自己家
I hope you don't mind me making myself at home.

431
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,500
我们那里没有鸡肉
Where I come from,we don't have chicken.

432
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,210
- 你到底是谁？ - 朗 你知道的
- Who the hell are you?  - Oh, you know me, Lon.

433
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,130
是你叫我过来的
You're the one that called me here.

434
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,330
不是说你是打电话叫我来的
Not by the telephone...

435
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,550
而是我感觉到了你那强烈的愿望 你想甩掉那个小家伙
...but with your every desire to get rid of the brat...

436
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,420
这样的话你就可以得到他妈妈更多的爱
...all in the hopes that Mommy there might love you best.

437
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,640
你这懦夫 朗
But you'll always be a seat-filler, Lon.

438
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,180
- 你快点滚出去  - 朗
- You get out of here right now.  - Lon.

439
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,930
这是出现在杰克画作里的那个男人
It's the man from Jake's drawings.

440
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,770
画作？
Drawings?

441
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,940
停止呼吸
Stop breathing.

442
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,740
- 啊！ - 安静
- Aah!  - Quiet.

443
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,280
画作
Drawings.

444
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,590
带我去看看
Show me.

445
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,200
好吧 看起来这小家伙像是成天在跟踪我啊
Well, it looks like I've got myself a stalker.

446
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,600
枪侠
Gunslinger.

447
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,410
你儿子是不是挺特别的
This son of yours is quite special,isn't he?

448
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:41,130
你没有相信他
The guilt you must feel...

449
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,880
你肯定会因此感到内疚
...not believing in him.

450
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,810
而且还把你唯一的孩子送到了庇护所
And you sent your only child off to the asylum.

451
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,310
真为你
Shame...

452
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,310
感到羞耻
...on you.

453
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,880
有陌生人来了
Stranger approaching!

454
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,550
去看看
Gather round!

455
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,390
祝天长 夜爽
Long days, pleasant nights.

456
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,520
祝收成加倍
May you have twice that number.

457
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,600
我上次见到地球人的时候 还只是个年轻人
I haven't seen one of your kind since I was a young man.

458
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,560
你这么活生生的…
Seeing you here, alive...

459
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,650
你们这能力最强的预言家是谁
Who's your strongest seer?

460
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,360
那就是我了
That would be me.

461
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,900
我叫艾拉
I'm Arra.

462
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,410
这地方出现在这个男孩的幻象中
The boy here has visions of this place.

463
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,160
我要知道这是什么地方
I need to know where it is.

464
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,120
黑衣人
The Man in Black.

465
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,460
老大 我们已经对塔造成严重损伤了
We managed to do some serious damage, sir...

466
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,550
- 但它还是没有坍塌  - 这不重要了
- ...but it didn't fall.  - None of that matters.

467
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,470
我找到关键人物了 这个孩子会以一己之力
I found the one. This kid's going to bring down the Tower...

468
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,050
摧毁黑暗塔
...all by his lonesome.

469
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,680
- 那个孩子在哪  - 他就在这
- Where is this child?  - He's here...

470
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,470
在中世界
...on Mid-World...

471
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,310
他们在我的一个老朋友 艾德的罗兰
...looking for an old friend of mine, Roland of Eld.

472
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,560
等下 我还以为枪侠都死光了呢
Wait, I thought all the Gunslingers were dead.

473
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,230
罗兰那阻挡我魔法的能力
Roland's always had an annoying ability...

474
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
真是令人讨厌
...to resist my magics.

475
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,650
所以我基本把他在乎的人都杀了
So I basically killed everyone he ever cared about.

476
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,280
上次我听说他在 漫无目的的闲逛
Last I heard, he was roaming the Mohaine aimlessly.

477
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,780
- 那个男孩正是要去那里  - 莫因沙漠么 那不是…
- That's where the boy is going.  - Mohaine Desert? Isn't that...?

478
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,370
是的 那是个壮观的沙漠 那男孩的灵力也颇为壮观啊
Vast. Yes. And so is this boy's Shine.

479
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,460
老大 我马上派我们的人过去
I'll send our trackers in the region, sir.

480
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,430
这会恶化的
This will get worse.

481
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,430
我这没办法治疗你受的伤
I don't have anything that can help with that.

482
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,220
你需要休息 让伤口愈合
You need to rest, let it heal.

483
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,600
我没事的
I'll be fine.

484
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,400
谢谢你
Thankee, Sai.

485
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,730
你从地球大老远跑过来找他
You've come all the way from Keystone Earth to find him.

486
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,110
他所具有的灵力超乎寻常
His Shine is beyond anything I've ever seen.

487
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,950
灵力？
Shine?

488
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,280
灵知之力
Psychic powers.

489
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,250
很少有人生来就有这种能力
Very few are born with this gift.

490
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,460
大多数人这方面的能力很弱 都注意不到自己具有这个能力
Often, the power is so slight, people don't even know they have it.

491
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:07,840
杰克 你的灵力太强了
Your Shine burns so brightly, Jake.

492
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,920
你身上潜力之大 难以想象
You have potential I can't even begin to understand.

493
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,260
哇
Whoa.

494
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,600
她的声音跑进我脑袋里了
Her voice was in my head.

495
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,520
杰克 你天赋异禀
Your gift is extraordinary, Jake.

496
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,900
所以你能看到别的世界
It made you see across worlds.

497
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,940
那些画
The drawing.

498
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,520
你画的画 是怎么回事
What about the drawing?

499
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,030
集中注意
Concentrate.

500
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,950
让我看看你的幻象
Share your visions with me.

501
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,710
放开
Open up.

502
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,590
让我看看
Show me.

503
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,260
黑衣人
The Man in Black...

504
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,640
杰克
Jake.

505
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,720
穿过沙漠
Fled across the desert.

506
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,020
告诉我
Tell me.

507
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:07,860
他在哪
Where is he?

508
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,780
在废土之地的北部
Northern Wastelands.

509
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,820
到那边至少得要六个月的时间
That's more than six months of travel.

510
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,740
但是有你的帮助 我们能更快到那边
But you can get me there faster than that.

511
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,750
黑衣人和他的手下控制了所有的通道运输
The Man in Black and his men keep track of all portal travel.

512
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,750
- 我得去那边  - 通道是什么
- I need to get there.  - Portals.

513
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,170
就算我们愿意 我们也帮不了你
We couldn't help you, even if we wanted to.

514
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,010
要想去他们的地盘 唯一的办法就是通过他们的基地
The only way to access their territories is from one of their own bases.

515
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,510
那我步行过去好了
Then I'll make it on foot.

516
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,390
等下
Wait.

517
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,180
那些蒙面人…
The fake-skins...

518
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,230
是不是会把其他世界的孩子们抓走
...they take kids from different worlds, right?

519
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,940
我在纽约的时候 他们试图把我抓走
They tried to take me from New York.

520
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:52,190
- 是不是就是说他们…  - 他们在那边有个基地
- Doesn't that mean that they...?  - They have a base there.

521
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:56,070
通过那边的通道我们能直接到达画上的这个地方
With a portal that can take me right to this place.

522
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,240
你要把我们送回地球
You're gonna send us to Keystone Earth.

523
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,630
我们正在把能量转移到发电机上
We're diverting power to the generators.

524
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,840
不久后通道就充能完毕了
The portal will be ready shortly.

525
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,890
你的世界里有枪么
Do they have guns in your world?

526
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,180
有啊
Yeah.

527
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,140
那子弹呢 是不是像这边一样稀有
And bullets, are they as rare as they are here?

528
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,350
你肯定会爱上那个地方的 地球上子弹可多了
You're gonna like Earth. A lot.

529
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,740
我们约定过的 除非村庄陷入危险之中 我们绝不启用这个通道
We agreed we'd never use the portal unless the village was in danger.

530
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,700
他们会发现我们 然后到这来
They will find out we have it and come.

531
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:46,040
我们不能违背枪侠的意志 他的意志即是律法
We can't disobey a Gunslinger. It's the law.

532
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,830
- 你们又何从得知他的真实身份呢  - 艾拉
- How do you know what he is?  - Arra.

533
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,210
你肯定对他用过灵知之力了
You must have read him.

534
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,880
你看到了什么
What do you see?

535
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,670
他是基列地的罗兰
He's Roland of Gilead.

536
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,340
他是艾德的最后一位后裔
Last of the line of Eld.

537
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:09,270
但是他的灵魂在黑衣人的口袋里
But the Man in Black has his soul in his pocket...

538
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:13,520
仇恨充斥着他的内心
...and his heart's consumed by vengeance.

539
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,940
他不是枪侠了
He's not a Gunslinger.

540
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,900
不是以前的那个他了
Not anymore.

541
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,160
你有什么想解释的么
Or would you tell us differently?

542
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,200
只有山羊才会对预言家撒谎
Only a goat would lie to a seer.

543
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,450
你让你的祖先背上骂名
You dishonor your ancestors.

544
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,920
枪侠们曾发誓要保卫黑暗塔…
The Gunslingers have sworn an oath to defend the Tower...

545
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,750
看看你周围的世界吧
Look around you.

546
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,460
战争已经结束了 我们输了
The war is over, and we lost.

547
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:42,470
走出自己的世界 用眼睛看看吧
If you left your little haven, you would see that for yourself.

548
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,930
到处都是黑暗
The darkness is everywhere...

549
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,310
反抗是徒劳无功的
...and trying to fight against it accomplishes nothing.

550
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,480
你们大多数人还没有出生时 我就在为保护黑暗塔而战了
I was fighting to defend the Tower before most of you were even born.

551
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,900
我以前一直
There's always a battle.

552
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,610
为它而战
Always.

553
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,280
但我再也不会了
But no more.

554
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,660
正是因为有你这样的想法 我们才会输
Isn't that why we're losing?

555
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,570
因为所有人都放弃了信仰
Because everyone stopped believing.

556
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:10,710
只要黑暗仍未消散 黑暗塔终会倾塌
As long as the darkness is out there, the Tower will fall.

557
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:14,460
在那之前 我要复仇
And before that happens, I will get my revenge.

558
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,100
我觉得
Look.

559
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,230
他救了我的命
He saved my life.

560
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,320
尽管他不太喜欢我
And he doesn't even like me that much.

561
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,910
他还是枪侠
He's still a Gunslinger.

562
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,950
我能感觉到的
I know he is.

563
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,710
估计现在差不多准备好了
Should be ready anytime now.

564
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,540
调准位置后 通道应该会通向
As soon as it aligns, it should open...

565
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,920
你的世界中的
...in an unobstructed area in your city...

566
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,050
一片开阔地上
...on your version of Earth.

567
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,510
“应该”？
"Should"?

568
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,130
这项技术已经很老了
Technology's very old.

569
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,890
记住那一串数字 若是要回到这里就要靠它们了
Remember that number. It's your way back here.

570
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,470
明白了
Got it.

571
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,180
我以前用过通道
Been there.

572
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:15,940
嘿
Hey.

573
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,650
你没事吧
You Okay?

574
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,650
怎么了
What's wrong?

575
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,520
没能量了
We're losing power.

576
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,440
老大 他们进村子了
Sir, they're in the village.

577
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:18,960
法拉斯 唉
Oh, no. Faras.

578
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,540
- 你能修好它么  - 村子里有备用零件
- Can you fix it?  - We have spare parts in the village.

579
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:28,340
杰克 去附近找个地方躲起来
Jake, go find somewhere close to hide, understand?

580
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,890
好
Yeah.

581
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:47,570
快跑！
Come on!

582
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,070
快躲进屋
Get inside!

583
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,820
- 我们快走 快  - 你没事吧
- We need to go! Hurry!  - Are you okay?

584
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,490
去拿武器
Go get weapons!

585
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,460
走哪边
Which way?

586
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,460
就在那边
In there.

587
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,840
他就在那
He's there.

588
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,800
他受伤了
He's hurt.

589
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,380
我的孩子 求求你们了！
My child! Please!

590
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,340
他的枪由亚瑟·艾德本人的
His guns are forged from the steel...

591
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,890
剑重铸而成
...of the sword of Arthur Eld himself.

592
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,850
地球人把它称作“誓约胜利之剑”
I believe Keystoners call it Excalibur.

593
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,530
你们快走吧！
Please, just go!

594
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,580
去找人帮忙吧！
Just get help, please!

595
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,670
- 我们不能待在这了  - 不 我得救他们出来
- We have to get out of here.  - No, I've got to get them out!

596
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,840
别管了 我们要逃命了
No, no, please, we have to go!

597
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,630
- 啊！ - 快跑
- Ahh!  - Run.

598
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,340
- 我们走  - 救命！
- Let's go!  - Help!

599
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,970
去拿零件
Go get the parts.

600
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,260
爸爸
Dad!

601
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,270
他们在追捕我们的儿子
They were after our boy.

602
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,860
为什么他们要抓走我们的孩子
Why would they want our boy?

603
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,980
好
Right.

604
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,440
- 去把水泵打开 动作快点  - 马上就去
- Turn on the water pumps. Quickly.  - Right away, sir.

605
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,240
- 不  - 我们想办法把他们救出来
- No!  - Let's try to get them out!

606
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,410
- 没事了 我会保护你们的  - 没事了
- Okay, I'll take care of you!  - All right.

607
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,200
可算找到你了 没事吧
There you are. All right?

608
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:59,950
跟我来
Come this way.

609
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,720
你救不了他的 罗兰
You couldn't save him, Roland.

610
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,940
长官 感应到灵力
Sir, Shine.

611
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,810
就是那个男孩 抓住他
That's the boy. Get him.

612
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,240
杰克
Jake.

613
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,830
杰克
Jake.

614
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,670
- 他们是冲他来的  - 我知道
- They're here for him.  - I know.

615
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,760
罗兰
Roland.

616
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,220
- 你要干什么  - 别说话
- What are you doing?  - Quiet.

617
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:30,380
罗兰 快救救我 求求你
Roland. Please. Help me, please.

618
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,170
快走 赶快
Let's go! Let's go!

619
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:13,840
我们得赶紧离开这儿
We need to leave.

620
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,210
他在这里不安全
He's not safe here.

621
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,050
要是他不离开 你也会有生命危险
And as long as he's here, you aren't either.

622
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,300
我们来断后
We have this fight.

623
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,760
- 走吧  - 快
- Come on.  - Go.

624
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,760
杰克
Jake.

625
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,220
用灵力时要注意 他们会追踪你
Be careful using the Shine. They're tracking you.

626
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,600
传送门准备就绪
Portal alignment complete.

627
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,020
快
Come on.

628
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,740
不 还没熟呢
No, it's not ready yet.

629
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,710
- 他有刀子  - 他只是个厨子
- Knife.  - He's a chef.

630
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:54,920
走吧
Come on.

631
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,970
好多人啊
So many people.

632
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,860
你需要治疗 不能再耽误了
We need to get you help. Right now.

633
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,620
他们使用了通道
They had a portal.

634
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,500
他们溜走了
I think they're gone.

635
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,930
把坐标发给我
Get me the coordinates.

636
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:56,690
这是你们最后一次侥幸逃脱了 我的朋友
One last time around the wheel, old friend.

637
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,820
这太疯狂了
This is madness.

638
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:05,490
你不能揣着枪进医院的
You can't walk into a hospital here carrying guns.

639
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,820
相信我 来吧
Trust me. Come on.

640
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,000
我来负责交谈
Let me do all the talking.

641
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,290
你好 这里是劳丽 朗和杰克的家
Hi. You've reached Laurie, Lon and Jake.

642
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,800
请留下你的口信
Please leave a detailed message...

643
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,630
我们会尽快回复你
...and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

644
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,590
真糟糕 试试看
This is awful. Try it.

645
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,300
- 这是啥啊 看着真恶心  - 是很糟心 但你还是得试试
- That looks gross. What is it?  - You got to try it. It's terrible.

646
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:30,310
- 糟心的话 我压根儿就不想试  - 好像是个芒果
- I don't want to try it if it's terrible.  - It's like mango...

647
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,180
现在这里的动物还能说话吗
Do the animals here still speak?

648
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:36,400
啥 不会 那只是个广告
What? No, that's a commercial.

649
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,110
等下 你说“还”是什么意思
Wait, what do you mean by "still"?

650
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,030
他在这儿
He's in here.

651
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:45,450
德斯钦先生
Mr. Deschain.

652
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,370
我们给你注射了抗生素
I see the antibiotics are kicking in.

653
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,450
按一到十的等级划分 你的疼痛属于几级
On a scale of one to 10, how bad is your pain?

654
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,790
好吧
Okay...

655
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,330
你的情况看上去很糟糕
You were in very bad shape.

656
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,290
你还能坐起身 我感到很意外
I'm surprised you're even sitting up.

657
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,920
我比大多数人都要强壮
I'm stronger than most.

658
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,420
看得出来
We get that sentiment a lot.

659
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:07,510
那么除了感染和在化装舞会事故中
So aside from your infection and the wound from the...

660
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,680
…受的伤外…
...costume-party incident...

661
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:14,180
我们还发现了甲型 乙型和戊型肝炎的迹象
...we also found traces of hepatitis A, B, E, and...

662
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,400
还有慢性辐射病
...chronic radiation sickness.

663
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,070
过去几个月中 你有出国旅游吗
Have you traveled overseas in the past couple of months?

664
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,870
没有 我一直都待在地球
No. I've been here on Keystone Earth.

665
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,870
那你们到底能不能治好我
So am I cured or not?

666
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,170
你得在医院呆一晚好让我们监测你的情况
We're going to keep you here for the night to monitor your progress.

667
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:41,710
也许明天下午 你干什么 不行
Maybe tomorrow afternoon-What are you doing? No.

668
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,550
- 我不能留在这儿  - 你得躺回病床上
- I can't stay here.  - You need to get back on that.

669
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,550
- 德斯钦先生 你得  - 谢谢你的检查
- Mr. Deschain, you need...  - For your services.

670
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,550
- 什么 等会儿  - 好人一生平安
- Wait, what?  - May your days be long.

671
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,300
但你得回到病床上
But you need to get back on that.

672
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,010
- 德斯钦先生  - 把我的枪带上
- Mr. Deschain?  - Bring my guns.

673
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,680
这是些止痛药和维他命
These are painkillers and vitamins.

674
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,770
你一次只用吃一到两
You only want to take one or two at a...

675
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,270
片 嘿 小可爱
...time. WOMAN: Hey, cutie.

676
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,780
能给我们也来点儿吗
Can we join the party?

677
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:09,400
我看你俩是三天不打 上房揭瓦
You have both forgotten the faces of your fathers.

678
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,530
我想你还是不要跟这里的人说话了
You probably shouldn't talk to people here.

679
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,460
这是啥
What is this?

680
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,170
糖
Sugar.

681
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:32,140
我们要怎么找到传送门 纽约可不是个小地方
How we gonna find the portal? New York's a pretty big place.

682
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,510
不知道
I don't know.

683
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,220
我也不能让沃特知道我是如何找到他的
I just can't let Walter know how I'm coming for him.

684
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,690
我有个主意
I've got an idea.

685
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,950
那些止痛药见效真快
These painkillers work fast.

686
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,080
好久都没感觉这么爽了
I haven't felt this good in years.

687
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,990
是啊 我们拿到宝了
Yeah, we got the good stuff.

688
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:01,120
那种糖还有吗
Got any more of that sugar?

689
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,290
在这里你不用害怕
There's nothing to be scared of.

690
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:07,090
我向你保证 不管发生什么
I promise you, whatever happens...

691
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,260
你都会安然无恙的
...you'll be at peace.

692
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,430
- 安然无恙  - 预言家所撒得谎
- You'll be...  - A seer who lies.

693
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:15,680
最为致命
The worst kind.

694
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:20,060
我开始喜欢你了
I like you already.

695
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,940
那么现在
Come now.

696
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,770
永别了
Good bye.

697
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,230
告诉我
Talk.

698

Shh.

699
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:37,080
不要反抗 他把那孩子带去哪儿了
Don't fight it. Where did he take the boy?

700
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:39,830
杰克
Jake?

701
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,040
杰克·钱伯斯 是的 他在哪儿
Chambers, yes. Where?

702
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,710
- 地…地…  - 地球

703
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,920
谢谢了
Thank you.

704
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:04,060
嘿 还记得我吗
Hey, remember me?

705
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,480
你提醒过我 说他们正在劫走儿童
You said they were crossing over kids.

706
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,780
你是他们中的一员吧
You were one of them, weren't you?

707
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,490
我丢失了灵力
I lost it. The Shine.

708
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,870
他们带你走的哪条路
Which way did they take you through?

709
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:21,910
- 不 不 你得赶紧逃跑  - 你还记得吗 哪个传送门 在哪里
- No, no, you have to run.  - Do you remember? A portal, a door.

710
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,960
- 任何线索都行  - 要结束了
- Anything, please.  - It's almost over.

711
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,330
一切都要结束了
It's almost over.

712
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,290
都要结束了 都要结束了
It's almost over. It's almost over.

713
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,920
听到了吗
Can you hear me?

714
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,880
记住 展示给我看看
Remember. Show me.

715
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,590
迪克西酒吧
Dixie.

716
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,010
杰克
Jake!

717
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:40,890
杰克
Jake!

718
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,180
他们能追踪到灵力
They can track the Shine.

719
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,890
明白吗
Okay?

720
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,320
我知道你是谁
I know what you are.

721
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,610
枪侠
Gunslinger.

722
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,360
你走吧
Go.

723
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:05,580
线索应该足以让我们找到传送门了 只需回家再调查一下
Should have enough to find it. Got to get home and do some research.

724
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:09,170
- 回你家吗  - 是的 我得让妈妈知道我平安无事
- Your home?  - Yeah, I got to let my mom know I'm okay.

725
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,880
我们的追踪者遍布全城
We have trackers spread throughout the city.

726
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:13,590
目前尚未发现他们的行踪
There's no trace of him yet, sir.

727
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,880
已经尽其所能 但仍是心有余而力不足
Couple of small spikes, but not enough to hone in on.

728
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,260
别担心 伙计
Don't you worry, Dicky-boy.

729
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:19,140
- 我是来帮你们的  - 长官
- I've got you covered.  - Sir?

730
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,470
我给我们的朋友准备了个大惊喜 你随时待命
I left a surprise for our little friend. Just be ready.

731
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,390
- 你就在这儿等着吧  - 哥们儿
- You should probably wait here.  - Dude.

732
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,640
- 你最近跑哪儿去了  - 蒂米 呃
- Where the hell have you been?  - Timmy. Um...

733
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:28,940
这位是谁
Who's that?

734
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,730
我待会再告诉你
I'll tell you later.

735
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,320
妈妈和朗怎么样 他们肯定急疯了
How's Mom and Lon? They must be freaking out.

736
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,400
他们昨天就一直没回家
They haven't been home since yesterday.

737
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,910
妈妈 妈妈
Mom.Mom.

738
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:52,630
- 妈妈  - 杰克
- Mom?  - Jake.

739
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:54,090
- 妈妈 妈妈 妈妈  - 杰克

748
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:26,620
- 什么画  - 妈妈

749
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:27,950
不会让你太痛苦的
I'll make it quick.

750
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:29,870
杰克
Jake!

751
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,540
不
No.

752
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,000
别这样 杰克
No, Jake.

753
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,260
- 别去看了  - 妈妈
- Don't see it.  - Mom.

754
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,630
这是他的圈套
It's what he wants.

755
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,350
- 他要追踪你  - 她去世了
- He's tracking you.  - She's dead.

756
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,640
别想那些
Close your mind.

757
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:49,270
别想那些 摒弃痛苦 杰克
Close your mind. Let the pain run through you, Jake.

758
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,440
他杀了她
He killed her.

759
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:54,270
- 我知道 我知道  - 他杀了她
- I know. I know.  - He killed her.

760
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:00,110
过来
Come here.

761
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,890
我会杀了他
I will kill him.

762
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,730
为我俩报仇
For both of us.

763
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:45,660
那黑暗塔怎么办
What about the Tower?

764
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,790
我妈妈也死了 你却一心只想着报仇
My mom died so you could have your revenge?

765
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:01,720
也许你的世界已经岌岌可危 但是我的世界还有希望
Maybe your world is almost gone, but mine isn't.

766
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,680
你说过的 只要黑暗仍未消散
You said it yourself, as long as the darkness is out there...

767
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,350
这座塔将一直处于危险之中
...the Tower's always in danger.

768
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,140
我觉得 他们说得对
You know, they were right.

769
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,270
你不是一个称职的枪侠
You're not a Gunslinger.

770
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:24,070
看这儿
Here.

771
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,490
这个通道入口在一个叫做迪格西皮格的酒吧里
It's called the Dixie Pig.

772
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,280
在普利茅斯和珍珠路的交界处
It's on Plymouth and Pearl.

773
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,300
我年轻的时候
When I was younger...

774
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,890
我会背诵枪侠的信条
...I would recite the Gunslinger's Creed.

775
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,020
它能使思绪平静下来
It calms the heart and the mind.

776
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:00,190
我已经很多年没背过了
I haven't spoken it for years.

777
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:26,050
枪准不在于双手
I do not aim with my hand.

778
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:30,260
违此者 忘祖也
He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.

779
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,260
枪准在于双眼
I aim with my eye.

780
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:39,020
枪准不在于双手
I do not shoot with my hand.

781
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:43,150
违此者 忘祖也
He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.

782
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,320
枪准在于头脑
I shoot with my mind.

783
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,250
枪准不在于所用之枪
I do not kill with my gun.

784
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,920
违此者 忘祖也
BOTH He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.

785
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,340
枪侠不倒
Not while the Tower still stands.

786
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,720
塔就不倒
Not while you still stand.

787
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,010
- 枪准在于我的心  - 枪准在于我的心
- I kill with my heart.  - I kill with my heart.

788
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,980
很好
That's good.

789
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:24,610
你的灵力就是你的武器 杰克
Your Shine is your weapon, Jake.

790
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,150
枪是我的武器
Guns are mine.

791
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,800
有什么需要帮忙的么
Can I help you fellas?

792
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,800
- 嘿  - 四五口径子弹
- Hey.  - Forty-five-caliber bullets.

793
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:52,050
额
Uh...

794
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,510
- 我只有…  - 我们全部带走
- I only have...  - We'll take them all.

795
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,560
按他说的做 他不会伤害你的
Just do what he says. He won't hurt you.

796
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,970
我不想惹上什么麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

797
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,310
那好 你比大多数人都聪明的多
Well, then you're smarter than most.

798
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:01,980
快点
Hurry Up...

799
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:15,370
走吧 带你去个安全的地方
All right, let's get you somewhere safe.

800
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,870
枪侠
Gunslinger.

801
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:22,420
你想我了吗
Did you miss me?

802
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,750
我觉得 你肯定想我了
Well, I guess you did.

803
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,710
罗兰 罗兰 罗兰
Roland! Roland, Roland.

804
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,130
杰克 快跑
Jake, run.

805
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,760
快跑
Run!

806
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:46,150
我猜你找到了指南针的话 肯定还会来找我的
I see you finally found a compass, yet you still came to me.

807
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,070
因为我才是你唯一的，目标 罗兰
Because I'm your only destination, Roland.

808
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,570
开火
Fire away.

809
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,490
这不是我 我控制不住自己
It's not me. I'm not doing this.

810
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:01,700
首先 你想保住黑暗塔
First, you want to save the Tower.

811
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,870
然后 你想杀掉黑衣人
Then, kill the Man in Black.

812
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,420
你就像狗一样 反反复复的把扔出去的棍子叼回来
You are like a dog fetching a stick over and over.

813
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:15,090
你有没有告诉那个孩子老一代枪侠是怎么死的
You tell the kid what happened to the old crew?

814
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:18,760
你有没有告诉他 每个在你身边的人都死在了我的手里吗
You tell him that everyone that walks with you dies by my hand?

815
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,180
这次不会了
Not this time.

816
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:22,140
你的妈妈 皮肤软软的哟
Your soft-skinned mother?

817
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:24,230
- 还有你的枪侠朋友们  - 跟我当面对峙啊
- Your Gunslinger friends?  - Face me.

818
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,980
你在你那垂死的老父亲面前哭嚎着
Your whimpering excuse for a dad.

819
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:29,610
别天天摆弄你的魔法了 沃尔特 出来跟我当面对峙啊
Stop hiding behind your magic and face me, Walter!

820
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,490
我们都知道我们俩无论谁先死
We both know that no matter who crosses the finish line first...

821
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,660
宇宙终将消亡的
...the universe will die out eventually.

822
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,410
死亡才是胜者
Death always wins.

823
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,290
就是如此
That's the deal.

824
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,380
不 不
No, no.

825
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,010
罗兰
Roland.

826
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,510
罗兰
Roland.

827
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,580
耶
Yeah!

828
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:33,050
杰克·钱伯斯
Jake Chambers.

829
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:45,060
正如传言的那样 你这孩子天赋异禀啊
You are the full package, as advertised.

830
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:49,850
赛尔 做好准备
Sayre, get ready.

831
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,070
有个又高又黑又帅的家伙要来搞破坏
Tall, dark and handsome is about to crash the party.

832
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,960
我们走 快
Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

833
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,220
拿上枪就走
Take one and go.

834
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:26,560
好了 我们走 让所有人都脱离苦海 怎么样
Alrighty. Let's go put everyone out of their misery, shall we?

835
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,310
准备好了就启动 钱普
Any time, champ.

836
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:47,620
罗兰
Roland.

837
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,050
罗兰
Roland...

838
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:59,010
他们要带我去那个地方
...they're taking me to that place.

839
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:00,680
小心点
Be careful.

840
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,010
坚持住
Hang on.

841
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,590
我来救你了
I'm coming for you.

842
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:20,070
我们会搞定他的 先生
We'll get him, sir.

843
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,650
拜拜
Bye.

844
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:26,160
祝你们末日愉快
Have a great apocalypse.

845
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,500
包围他
Close in on him!

846
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:35,670
好的
Okay...

847
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:51,980
- 开始吧  - 先生
- Let's go.  - Sir.

848
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,020
设备启动了
We're online!

849
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:06,410
- 是不是这一切终于要到来了  - 是的 是的
- It's really gonna happen, isn't it?  - Oh, yes, it is.

850
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:25,070
出了点毛病
Something's wrong.

851
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:30,030
出问题了 读数停滞了
Something's wrong here. The levels are plateauing.

852
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,200
- 可能是因为他…  - 在反抗
- It's as if he's...  - Fighting back.

853
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,620
你为什么要反抗
Why do you resist?

854
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:39,000
你的幻象不是指引你去找他 而是来找我
Your visions didn't bring you to him, they brought you to me.

855
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,710
他根本不喜欢你 他根本不关心你
He doesn't love you. He doesn't care for you.

856
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:45,210
实际上 他这段时间一直利用你来找我
In fact, he's been using you this entire time to get to me.

857
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,510
这就是你为什么在这儿 这是你的宿命
This is why you're here. This is your destiny.

858
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,680
你杀了我妈妈
You killed my mom!

859
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,810
是的 完美极了 开始了
Yes, that's it. There we go.

860
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,950
是入口 关了它
Portal. Close it.

861
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:58,660
- 关掉它  - 我关不了
- Close it!  - I can't!

862
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:02,170
等等
Wait.

863
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:06,710
我的天 是那个孩子干的
Oh, my God. It's the kid.

864
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,720
他让那个入口保持开启状态
It's the kid! He's keeping the portal open!

865
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:13,510
真是了不起啊
Ahh. Impressive.

866
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:22,310
老朋友 你这是一定要我亲自上阵啊
So you wanted me to face you, old friend?

867
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:26,020
我来了
Here I am.

868
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:19,200
刚好你和塔要同时倒下了
It's fitting that you and the Tower should fall together.

869
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:11,670
罗兰
Roland.

870
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:16,590
罗兰 快起来
Roland, get up.

871
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,430
枪准不在于双手
I do not aim with my hand.

872
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,190
违此者 忘祖也
He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.

873
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,480
枪准在于双眼
I aim with my eye.

874
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,950
枪准不在于双手
I do not shoot with my hand.

875
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:39,740
违此者
He who shoots with his hand...

876
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:42,790
忘祖也
Has forgotten the face of his father.

877
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:45,160
枪准在于头脑
I shoot with my mind.

878
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:47,250
枪准在于头脑
I shoot with my mind.

879
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,920
枪准不在于所用之枪
I do not kill with my gun.

880
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:54,840
违此者
He who kills with his gun...

881
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:56,630
忘祖也
Has forgotten the face of his father.

882
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,550
忘祖也
Has forgotten the face of his father.

883
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,060
枪准在于我的心
I kill with my heart.

884
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,450
妈妈 爸爸
Mom, Dad.

885
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,120
- 太好了  - 亲爱的
- There they are.  - Sweetheart.

886
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:52,250
太好了 你们没事
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

887
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:00,710
许多人目击了…
Multiple witnesses saw...

888
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,970
天空中出现的怪象
...the strange phenomena in the sky.

889
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:03,470
似乎我们看到了最坏的状况
Looks like we've seen the worst of it...

890
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:05,470
气象中心发布声明
The weather center has now  issued  a statement...

891
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,510
称这可能是某种非常强烈的太阳耀斑导致的
...that it may have been some kind of very intense solar flare.

892
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,520
- 给你  - 这是什么
- Here.  - What is this?

893
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:15,940
- 谢谢  - 谢谢 热狗
- Thank you.  - Thanks. Hot dog.

894
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:17,900
野蛮人
Savages.

895
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:20,900
什么品种的
What breed?

896
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:22,650
不 这没有什么品种
No, it's not a breed.

897
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:32,040
我得离开这了 杰克
I have to leave here, Jake.

898
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,580
你明白的 对吗
You understand that, don't you?

899
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:38,090
我明白
I know.

900
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:46,800
你干嘛不跟我一起
Why don't you come with me?

901
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,310
真的可以跟你一起么
Really?

902
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:56,150
你在这儿又没事干
You have nothing here.

903
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:59,270
而且 你还可以帮帮我
Besides, I could use your help.

904
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:01,070
额
Uh...

905
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,650

Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

906
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:05,860
枪侠
