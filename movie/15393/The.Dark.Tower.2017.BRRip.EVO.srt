1
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:32,572
Jake.

2
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,192
Mom, you okay?

3
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:37,738
That was a big one.

4
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:41,975
Bad dreams?

5
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:43,809
No.

6
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,040
Come on.
Get breakfast.

7
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:03,812
<i>This morning's quake is causing
major problems for commuters.</i>

8
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:07,859
<i>The 5.7-magnitude quake hit
New York early this morning.</i>

9
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:11,263
<i>Yet another in a series of quakes
that has rattled both coasts.</i>

10
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:12,931
<i>Tokyo was hit again.</i>

11
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:14,941
<i>And with the Berlin quake last week</i>

12
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:17,953
<i>Question is: What is causing
all these earthquakes?</i>

13
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,815
Christ, even ESPN's doing the quakes now.

14
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:24,451
<i>But we still don't know
what's causing them.</i>

15
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:27,566
Hey. My folks sent me over to see
if you guys are still alive.

16
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,849
We're fine, Timmy.

17
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:29,931
That was pretty intense.

18
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:31,241
Yeah.

19
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:32,476
You good?

20
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,653
Yeah.
We're just running a little late.

21
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,947
See you later?
Say hi to your mom for me.

22
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:38,791
Ma, Laurie says hi.

23
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:41,543
Don't forget, you have Dr.
Hotchkiss after school.

24
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,695
We're wasting money on all those shrinks.

25
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:54,764
He's making progress.

26
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:29,699
So when's the apocalypse coming?

27
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:31,377
Come on man, just give me my book.

28
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:33,972
What's wrong, your meds stop working?

29
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,590
Give me my book!
Get off me!

30
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:38,867
Get off of me.

31
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:40,047
Hey. Hey.

32
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:41,543
That is enough, Chambers.

33
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:43,639
I need my book.

34
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:46,151
Hey.

35
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,034
You need to go home and cool off.

36
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:54,893
You've been...

37
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:56,250
quite busy, Jake.

38
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:03,650
This big tower in the clouds
you keep dreaming about...

39
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:08,255
you say these earthquakes we've been
having have something to do with it.

40
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:12,593
They happen because
the Tower is under attack.

41
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:19,358
You're a smart kid, Jake.

42
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:22,193
You know when you can't differentiate

43
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:24,696
between dreams and reality...
It's not a dream.

44
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:26,189
Okay.
I'm not crazy.

45
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,517
I always see the same thing.

46
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:30,400
The Tower, the Man in Black,

47
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:32,061
the creepy guys with the fake skins.

48
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,693
What if the Tower were destroyed?

49
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:41,972
Darkness and fire.

50
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,160
Let's talk about your dad.

51
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,356
Surprise.

52
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,376
When you lost your father,
your world fell apart.

53
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:56,942
You have these...

54
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,708
visions of impending hell on Earth
because that's how you feel inside.

55
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,627
Even words like darkness and fire.

56
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:07,640
Jake, you're describing
the night your father died.

57
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:10,584
Can't just be about that.

58
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,652
They're just dreams, Jake.

59
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:14,772
They're not real.

60
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,133
Watch out.

61
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:46,236
They'll take you.

62
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:47,712
They steal kids like you.

63
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:49,314
Cross them over.

64
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:52,509
Special ones.

65
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:54,817
The power of your mind,

66
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,196
that's what they want.

67
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:14,823
Jake.

68
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:16,682
What's up?

69
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,143
Bad day?

70
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,710
Yeah.

71
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:21,837
Let's go.

72
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:23,607
Want to hang out?
Yeah.

73
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:26,617
Control, he's unstable.
We need to take the offer.

74
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,369
It's great treatment for no money.

75
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,978
It's not about the money.

76
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:31,584
I'll wait in your room.
There's nothing more we can do for him now.

77
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:34,324
Jesus, Lon! Can you at least
pretend like he's your own kid?

78
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:39,656
I'm sorry baby we...

79
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,699
We didn't hear you come in.

80
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,902
What the hell happened in school today?

81
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:46,488
You promised me you're
gonna stay out of trouble.

82
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:48,406
Sorry, Mom.

83
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,001
Honey,

84
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:55,330
the school's been approached
by a clinic upstate.

85
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,332
They work with kids who...

86
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,326
Who are having a hard time.

87
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:02,203
There's an opening this weekend.

88
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:04,748
It's supposed to be a great place.

89
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,692
It's science-based,
brain scans, sleep patterns.

90
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:09,453
I think it could.
Yeah, okay.

91
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,184
Man, psycho camp.

92
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:17,519
Sucks, dude.

93
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,236
More shrinks.

94
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:21,046
Waste of time.

95
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:30,407
Dude.

96
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:32,709
What?

97
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:34,536
Stop staring at your drawings.

98
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:36,279
You're freaking me out.

99
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,833
You think I'm crazy too, don't you?

100
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:41,668
Batshit.

101
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,801
Driving us apart.

102
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:54,890
I'm just asking

103
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,058
We need help. We both need help.

104
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:58,602
We are falling apart.

105
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,270
I love him so much

106
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:04,107
and I just can't stand to see him like this.

107
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:06,343
He was such a happy kid.

108
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,756
No more dreams.

109
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:29,958
Just one night of sleep.

110
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:52,214
You have nothing to be afraid of, my friend.

111
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:56,343
Death is not far away.

112
00:10:57,452 --> 00:10:59,513
You want to know what's
on the other side?

113
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,524
Can you see it?

114
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,287
Of course you can't.

115
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:09,122
Because nothing is there.

116
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,882
It's all a lie.

117
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:13,542
Go to hell.

118
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:14,901
Been there.

119
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:16,836
Now burn.

120
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,684
We lost.

121
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:32,228
Not while the Tower still stands.

122
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:34,338
Not while you still stand.

123
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:41,871
Don't let him get into your head.

124
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:43,232
<i>Gunslingers.</i>

125
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,845
I do not aim with my hand.

126
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,673
He who aims with his hand.
Has forgotten the face of his father.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
I aim with my eye.

128
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,766
<i>Gunslinger, over here.</i>

129
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:58,513
I do not shoot with my hand.

130
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,899
He who shoots with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

131
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,686
I shoot with my mind.
<i>Gunslingers.</i>

132
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:07,539
I do not kill with my gun.

133
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:11,743
He who kills with his gun has
forgotten the face of his father.

134
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,037
I kill with my heart.

135
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:16,072
Stop breathing.

136
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:18,782
No.

137
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:25,023
Breathe.

138
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,490
Fight it.

139
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,114
Fight it!

140
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,754
It never works on you, does it Roland?

141
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:42,483
The power you have to resist my magics.

142
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:46,611
Not forever.

143
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:49,840
Face me!

144
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:52,542
Face me.

145
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,976
The Tower will fall, Roland.

146
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:04,846
Until next time, old friend.

147
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,003
<i>The Man in Black fled across the desert,</i>

148
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,771
<i>and the Gunslinger followed.</i>

149
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,387
Holy shit.

150
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:23,884
Hey.
This guy,

151
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,682
he's some kind of soldier.

152
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,727
He's called a Gunslinger.

153
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:28,774
And this house,

154
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,545
look, it's got a U.S. mailbox.

155
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:32,657
I think it's in New York.
Timmy, it's 7 a.m.

156
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:34,058
Time to say goodbye.

157
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:36,378
Sorry, got to go.
Talk to you later.

158
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,548
The people from the clinic are here.

159
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,358
Now?

160
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,835
I can't. I can't go now.

161
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:02,503
You got to step up, Jake.

162
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,898
If you won't do it for yourself,
then do it for your mom.

163
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,666
It's in other boys?
It's very common in adolescent boys.

164
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:11,396
There he is.

165
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:13,165
Hi there, Jake.

166
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:15,024
I'm Jill.

167
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:18,027
I'm your intake administration supervisor.

168
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:20,496
This is Toby, our driver.

169
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:22,273
How's it going, young man?

170
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,633
You pack your things?

171
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,877
What exactly do they do at your clinic?

172
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:29,013
Jake, these guys have been working
with the school for a long time.

173
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,249
No, that's okay, Laurie.
We encourage questions.

174
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:33,635
It shows spirit and vitality.

175
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,662
He's just a healthy growing boy.

176
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:38,973
I can assure you that all our
tests are done in a controlled

177
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,076
child-friendly environment.

178
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:43,794
We have a great deal experience
with cases like yours.

179
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:46,923
Night terrors, hallucinations,
odd obsessions.

180
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,259
Our approach is actually very gentle
compared to standard treatments.

181
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:53,404
I understand your concerns, but
you don't have to worry at all.

182
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,816
Mom, help me pack?

183
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,051
Yeah.

184
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,029
It's two days.

185
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:04,166
Do you want your ripped
jeans or your regular ones?

186
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:06,449
What's wrong?

187
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:07,726
Mom, it's them.

188
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:09,131
What?

189
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,814
It's the skin people from my dream.

190
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:18,963
Honey, you need to stop this.
No, you have to listen to me.

191
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,381
What's going on?

192
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:23,092
He's not human.

193
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,879
That's not his real face.
For chrissake.

194
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:26,070
Shut up, Lon.

195
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,103
You actually hope I'm crazy,

196
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,353
just so you can get me out of here.

197
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:32,893
Mom...

198
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,013
you have to believe me.

199
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:40,668
Lon, maybe this...
Can't you see he's gotten worse?

200
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:42,904
You're gonna go with them right now.

201
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,874
Or, I swear to God, I will drag
you down the stairs myself.

202
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,212
It's one weekend, kiddo.

203
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:02,458
If you don't like it,
then I'll come get you.

204
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,218
I promise.

205
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,046
Okay, I'll go.

206
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:20,877
I love you, Mom.

207
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:22,384
I love you too.

208
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:41,321
I'm just gonna get my toothbrush.

209
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:51,739
He is fine. He's just getting his things.
He's trying to escape.

210
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:53,006
Escape?

211
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:54,601
Jake?

212
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:56,519
Jake?

213
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:57,820
Chrissake. Jake?

214
00:16:58,045 --> 00:16:58,529
Jake.

215
00:16:58,853 --> 00:16:59,371
Jake!

216
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:00,857
Jake!

217
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:04,527
Jake!
Get him.

218
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:09,484
Come back here!

219
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:10,574
Don't worry.

220
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:12,369
Toby will get him down safely.

221
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:37,794
Stop running.

222
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:33,783
Mom? You okay?
<i>Where are you?</i>

223
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,285
You can't just run away like that, Jake.

224
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:37,624
<i>Please come home.</i>

225
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:38,996
Sorry, I can't.

226
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,197
<i>Right now.</i>

227
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:41,999
<i>Jake?</i>

228
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,001
I'll call you later.

229
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:45,545
<i>Love you, Mom.</i>

230
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,650
<i>Greetings, traveler.</i>

231
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,092
<i>Please enter destination.</i>

232
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,352
One, nine.

233
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,022
<i>One, nine, one, nine. Mid-World.</i>

234
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,891
<i>Mid-World.</i>

235
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:54,789
<i>One-way destination.</i>

236
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:40,970
Let me go!

237
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,265
Stop!

238
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,135
What?

239
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,906
Okay

240
00:22:42,073 --> 00:22:43,558
This is good.

241
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:47,119
It's all real.

242
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:58,102
New candidate.

243
00:23:58,127 --> 00:23:59,407
Female, age 11.

244
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:02,528
Looks good.

245
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:03,805
Arriving!

246
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,598
Welcome back, sir.

247
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,426
Find yourself a face, Rat Boy.

248
00:24:18,427 --> 00:24:19,562
You're in my house.

249
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:22,047
How was your trip?

250
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:24,383
Fine. Do we have any new leads?

251
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,663
What have you got?

252
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,515
These are all showing promise.

253
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,809
Our trackers are going
out to them as we speak.

254
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:36,066
There's been a serious breach of...

255
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:41,776
I'm not fantastic at waiting.

256
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:46,280
Unauthorized crossing, sir.

257
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,699
One of the old portals on Keystone Earth.

258
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:53,729
Has that ever happened before?

259
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,309
Find me a portal close by.

260
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:05,825
Love your mask.
Sir?

261
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:08,753
Choose a pretty face and
the world is your oyster.

262
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,638
Aligning, sir.

263
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,023
Who are you?

264
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:05,268
It's you.

265
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:10,247
I'm.. I'm Jake.

266
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:12,808
Jake. Jake Chambers.

267
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:14,994
I dreamt about you.

268
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
Please.

269
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:21,684
Here.

270
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:26,397
Look.

271
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:30,927
You're a Gunslinger, right?

272
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:41,173
There are no Gunslingers.

273
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:42,553
Not anymore.

274
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:49,663
But I saw you.
Your dreams deceived you, boy.

275
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,890
Told you what you want to hear.

276
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,328
I came a long way to find you.

277
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,538
From another world!

278
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,382
Have a nice trip back.

279
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:08,064
Hey. Wait!

280
00:27:09,465 --> 00:27:11,217
Dude, come on.

281
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:14,303
Look, I saw you.

282
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,456
There was a battlefield, and you were
fighting the Man in Black. And there...

283
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:20,625
The Man in Black?

284
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,352
No, no, no.
You know him?

285
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:24,163
Stop. Please, please, please.
He sent you.

286
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:25,397
You're one of his tricks.

287
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:27,316
No, no, no. I don't know!
Where is he hiding?!

288
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,382
I don't know! I just..

289
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:30,294
Where is he hiding?
I don't know, I swear!

290
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:33,080
I justl just saw him in my dreams,
like I saw you!

291
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:34,924
Your name is Roland, right?

292
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,744
Please.

293
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:49,079
When did you first see this?

294
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,256
A year ago.

295
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,353
Who is he?

296
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:55,593
He's a sorcerer.

297
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:01,507
In all your visions,

298
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:03,559
Walter is here?

299
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:05,070
Yeah.

300
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:06,471
In this place?

301
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:07,606
Yeah.

302
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,585
Wait, his name's Walter?

303
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:17,408
Cool. Yeah, keep it.

304
00:28:28,377 --> 00:28:29,878
I will find you.

305
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:34,630
There's a tribe, beyond that forest.

306
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:36,083
We'll go there.

307
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,973
They have seers who will read your visions.

308
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:47,312
Let's go. Keep up.

309
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:50,733
Okay.

310
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,242
I went down the slide.

311
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:03,495
Then I got water up my nose
and I went down

312
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:05,262
and I couldn't see anything.
Hate.

313
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,874
Yeah.

314
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:12,087
Sweetheart? What's wrong?

315
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:58,600
Walter Padick.
To what do we owe this great honor?

316
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:01,728
Someone used a portal here, in your city

317
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:03,464
without your knowledge.

318
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:06,434
Killed the house demon.

319
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,404
Forgive me, sir.

320
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,232
We'll find out who this
trespasser is and where he went.

321
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,609
Already on it.

322
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:17,528
Now be a good dog.

323
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:29,832
The blood is human.

324
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:31,959
<i>Boy</i>

325
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:36,046
His Shine is pure.

326
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:40,810
So that's how he got through.

327
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:43,595
Sir?

328
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:46,672
House demons are formidable beings but

329
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:49,385
a truly powerful psychic could override it.

330
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:53,222
A boy with the Shine strong
enough to kill a demon?

331
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:55,482
Jackpot.

332
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:59,920
Sayre, didn't two skins have
trouble with a kid yesterday?

333
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:17,546
Don't eat that.

334
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,757
Don't want to have to carry
you for the rest of the way.

335
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,543
Roland?

336
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:16,480
What are they?

337
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:17,723
Taheen.

338
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:20,100
They belong to Walter.

339
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,510
Don't run off in the woods.
It's not safe.

340
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:24,696
But you were the one who ran off.

341
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,573
You said you were hungry.

342
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:31,911
What?

343
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:41,138
You had theme parks here.

344
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:49,263
These ancient structures are
from before the world moved on.

345
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:51,123
No one knows what they are.

346
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:53,684
They're theme parks.

347
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,139
I saw you fight him.

348
00:33:02,276 --> 00:33:03,996
There was a field covered with bodies.

349
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:13,345
That was our final stand.

350
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:19,326
I lost my father that day.

351
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,463
You saw that?

352
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,007
Was it about the Tower?

353
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:36,802
The war?

354
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,630
Yes.

355
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:44,059
Now, eat your rabbit.

356
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,752
It's an honor to meet you in person, sir.

357
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:54,945
What brings you here?

358
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:56,279
How may we serve him?

359
00:33:56,346 --> 00:33:58,290
Well, I hear you lost a kid.

360
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,618
It. it wasn't our fault.

361
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:04,530
It was as if the child
knew what we were.

362
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,214
We're doing everything we can...

363
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:07,395
Name and location.

364
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,983
It's all in here.

365
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,633
Jake Chambers.

366
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:20,830
Now kill,

367
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:23,106
each other.

368
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:28,712
Calm down. Enjoy the show, folks.

369
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:31,348
You ain't seen nothing yet.

370
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,502
You draw with a good hand.

371
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:50,717
I don't know what this is.

372
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:56,714
It's a map.

373
00:34:58,392 --> 00:35:00,059
My father showed me a...

374
00:35:00,784 --> 00:35:02,477
a map like this once.

375
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:07,787
Inside the circle,

376
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:10,678
is your world and my world,

377
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:12,697
many others.

378
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:14,499
No one knows how many.

379
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:17,189
The Dark Tower stands,

380
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:19,412
at the center of all things.

381
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:24,218
And it's stood there from
the beginning of time.

382
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:26,911
And it sends out,

383
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:28,871
powerful energy,

384
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:30,349
that protects the universe,

385
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:33,118
shields us from what's outside.

386
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:35,470
What do you mean outside?

387
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:38,089
What's outside the universe?

388
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:44,821
Outside is endless darkness,

389
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:48,292
full of demons trying to get to us.

390
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:52,434
Walter wants to tear down the Tower,

391
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:53,679
and let them in.

392
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:57,117
When the Tower falls, he'll rule

393
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,128
in a world full of monsters.

394
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:02,731
But you're trying to stop him, aren't you?

395
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,517
To protect the Tower.

396
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:08,662
I've seen them try to destroy it.

397
00:36:08,928 --> 00:36:11,273
If we could just get there
There is no we, Jake.

398
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,259
All that matters to me is that I find,

399
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:16,228
and kill Walter.

400
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:18,806
That's it.

401
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:03,083
Beamquake.

402
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:05,185
Strong.

403
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:08,063
Sounds like screams.

404
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:19,658
They're just like the quakes
we get back home.

405
00:37:20,408 --> 00:37:22,378
Yeah, what happens in one world

406
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,297
echoes in others.

407
00:37:26,665 --> 00:37:28,700
Hope my mom's okay.

408
00:37:32,462 --> 00:37:34,173
Try to get some sleep.

409
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:39,403
That's not happening.

410
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:48,579
<i>Jake.</i>

411
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,292
<i>Jake.</i>

412
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,247
<i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

413
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,177
<i>Where are you?</i>

414
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:29,185
<i>Everyone who walks with you dies.</i>

415
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:40,905
<i>Jake.</i>

416
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,714
Hey, kiddo.

417
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:00,909
Dad?

418
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:03,896
Long time.

419
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:09,634
It's good to see you, man.
You got tall.

420
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,104
This isn't real.

421
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,865
You're...
Dead?

422
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:17,092
Not here.

423
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:21,029
I missed you.

424
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:23,073
I missed you too, kiddo.

425
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:25,116
Come on.

426
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:26,493
It's okay.

427
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:31,498
Let's go home.

428
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:38,962
No.

429
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:45,512
Darkness and fire.

430
00:39:50,517 --> 00:39:51,517
Jake!

431
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:53,937
Get away from it!

432
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,288
Roland.

433
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,182
My son.

434
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:18,244
Come with me.

435
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:27,220
It's okay.

436
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,122
It's gone.

437
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:32,959
My dad was in there.

438
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:35,954
No, they sense your weakness,

439
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,765
create illusions to distract you.

440
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:41,885
That wasn't anybody you know.

441
00:40:43,695 --> 00:40:45,280
I'm sorry.

442
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:52,362
That was just a small tear.

443
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:55,532
They happen after every attack on the Tower.

444
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:59,636
Those things, they're what's coming
if the Tower falls, aren't they?

445
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:01,045
Yes.

446
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:03,923
But if we find that place where
they're keeping the kids, we could...

447
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:05,932
What?

448
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:07,686
Something got out.

449
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:17,217
Run!

450
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,487
Jake, run!

451
00:42:44,107 --> 00:42:45,567
You're gonna need help.

452
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:47,777
I've hurt worse.

453
00:42:48,403 --> 00:42:49,854
But you're bleeding.

454
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:52,082
I heal fast.

455
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:56,828
You handled yourself well.

456
00:42:57,495 --> 00:42:59,723
That was brave, going for the gun.

457
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:05,044
They're gonna find him, Laurie.

458
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,290
We filled out every form.
They have his picture.

459
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:23,062
I hope you don't mind me
making myself at home.

460
00:43:23,529 --> 00:43:25,373
Where I come from,
we don't have chicken.

461
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,884
Who the hell are you?
Oh, you know me, Lon.

462
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:29,903
You're the one that called me here.

463
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:31,612
Not by the telephone,

464
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:34,324
but with your every desire
to get rid of the brat

465
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,101
all in the hopes that Mommy
there might love you best.

466
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:41,614
But you'll always be a seat-filler, Lon.

467
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,858
You get out of here right now.
Lon.

468
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,612
It's the man from Jake's drawings.

469
00:43:50,924 --> 00:43:52,050
Drawings?

470
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:56,721
Stop breathing.

471
00:43:58,231 --> 00:43:59,515
Quiet.

472
00:44:02,685 --> 00:44:03,962
Drawings.

473
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:14,364
Show me.

474
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,582
Well, it looks like I've got myself a stalker.

475
00:45:05,498 --> 00:45:07,075
Gunslinger.

476
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:25,184
This son of yours is quite special, isn't he?

477
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:40,608
The guilt you must feel,

478
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,262
not believing in him.

479
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:49,584
And you sent your only
child off to the asylum.

480
00:45:52,962 --> 00:45:54,189
Shame,

481
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,592
on you.

482
00:46:58,486 --> 00:46:59,654
Stranger approaching!

483
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:05,326
Gather round!

484
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:11,866
Long days, pleasant nights.

485
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,293
May you have twice that number.

486
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:17,781
I haven't seen one of your
kind since I was a young man.

487
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,341
Seeing you here, alive...

488
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:22,426
Who's your strongest seer?

489
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,137
That would be me.

490
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:26,681
I'm Arra.

491
00:47:27,682 --> 00:47:30,184
The boy here has visions of this place.

492
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:33,538
I need to know where it is.

493
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,402
The Man in Black.

494
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:42,585
We managed to do some
serious damage, sir

495
00:47:42,586 --> 00:47:44,466
but it didn't fall.
None of that matters.

496
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,249
I found the one.

497
00:47:45,674 --> 00:47:49,229
This kid's going to bring down
the Tower all by his lonesome.

498
00:47:50,288 --> 00:47:52,556
Where is this child?
He's here,

499
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:53,950
on Mid-World,

500
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:56,586
looking for an old friend of mine,

501
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,111
Roland of Eld.

502
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:01,340
Wait, I thought all the
Gunslingers were dead.

503
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:04,676
Roland's always had an annoying ability

504
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:06,179
to resist my magics.

505
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,931
So I killed everyone he ever cared about.

506
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:12,525
Last I heard, he was roaming
the Mohaine aimlessly.

507
00:48:12,526 --> 00:48:13,728
That's where the boy is going.

508
00:48:13,752 --> 00:48:15,209
Mohaine Desert? Isn't that?
Vast.

509
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,348
Yes. And so is this boy's Shine.

510
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:19,634
I'll send our trackers in the region, sir.

511
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:33,206
This will get worse.

512
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:35,509
I don't have anything
that can help with that.

513
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,202
You need to rest, let it heal.

514
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,079
I'll be fine.

515
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:44,175
Thankee, Sai.

516
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:46,582
You've come all the way from
Keystone Earth to find him.

517
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,891
His Shine is beyond
anything I've ever seen.

518
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:54,727
Shine?

519
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:56,062
Psychic powers.

520
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:59,023
Very few are born with this gift.

521
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:02,936
Often, the power is so slight,
people don't even know they have it.

522
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:07,315
<i>Your Shine burns so brightly, Jake.</i>

523
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:11,602
<i>You have potential I can't
even begin to understand.</i>

524
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,375
Her voice was in my head.

525
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:20,094
Your gift is extraordinary, Jake.

526
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:23,373
It made you see across worlds.

527
00:49:25,258 --> 00:49:26,417
The drawing.

528
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:28,302
What about the drawing?

529
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,208
Concentrate.

530
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:36,527
Share your visions with me.

531
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,186
<i>Open up.</i>

532
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:49,365
<i>Show me.</i>

533
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:57,039
<i>The Man in Black</i>

534
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,216
<i>Jake.</i>

535
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,501
<i>Fled across the desert.</i>

536
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:05,298
Tell me.

537
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:07,633
Where is he?

538
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,553
Northern Wastelands.

539
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,601
That's more than six months of travel.

540
00:50:19,562 --> 00:50:21,622
But you can get me there faster than that.

541
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:24,725
The Man in Black and his men
keep track of all portal travel.

542
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:26,683
I need to get there.

543
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:27,652
Portals.

544
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,947
We couldn't help you,
even if we wanted to.

545
00:50:30,314 --> 00:50:33,884
The only way to access their territories
is from one of their own bases.

546
00:50:36,162 --> 00:50:37,789
Then I'll make it on foot.

547
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:39,966
Wait.

548
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,561
The fake-skins...

549
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:46,906
they take kids from different worlds, right?

550
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:48,916
They tried to take me from New York.

551
00:50:49,183 --> 00:50:50,869
Doesn't that mean that they?
They have a base there.

552
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:55,748
With a portal that can take
me right to this place.

553
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,520
You're gonna send us to Keystone Earth.

554
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,407
We're diverting power to the generators.

555
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:15,618
The portal will be ready shortly.

556
00:51:18,704 --> 00:51:21,164
Do they have guns in your world?

557
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:22,958
Yeah.

558
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:27,421
And bullets, are they as
rare as they are here?

559
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:30,332
You're gonna like Earth. A lot.

560
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,518
We agreed we'd never use the portal
unless the village was in danger.

561
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:42,478
They will find out we have it and come.

562
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:44,858
We can't disobey a Gunslinger.

563
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:46,139
It's the law.

564
00:51:46,163 --> 00:51:47,509
How do you know what he is?
Arra.

565
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:49,985
You must have read him.

566
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:52,055
What do you see?

567
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:57,652
He's Roland of Gilead.

568
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,621
Last of the line of Eld.

569
00:52:05,668 --> 00:52:08,946
But the Man in Black has
his soul in his pocket

570
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:13,300
and his heart's consumed by vengeance.

571
00:52:14,135 --> 00:52:15,719
He's not a Gunslinger.

572
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,081
Not anymore.

573
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:22,134
Or would you tell us differently?

574
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,980
Only a goat would lie to a seer.

575
00:52:26,147 --> 00:52:27,732
You dishonor your ancestors.

576
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:30,693
The Gunslingers have sworn an
oath to defend the Tower

577
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,228
Look around you.

578
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,639
The war is over and we lost.

579
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:41,546
If you left your little haven,
you would see that for yourself.

580
00:52:42,997 --> 00:52:45,008
The darkness is everywhere,

581
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,385
and trying to fight against
it accomplishes nothing.

582
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,257
I was fighting to defend the Tower
before most of you were even born.

583
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:55,676
There's always a battle.

584
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,186
Always.

585
00:52:57,845 --> 00:52:59,054
But no more.

586
00:53:00,473 --> 00:53:02,433
Isn't that why we're losing?

587
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,052
Because everyone stopped believing.

588
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,883
As long as the darkness is out
there, the Tower will fall.

589
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,736
And before that happens,
I will get my revenge.

590
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:33,881
Look.

591
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:36,308
He saved my life.

592
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,995
And he doesn't even like me that much.

593
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:44,783
He's still a Gunslinger.

594
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,328
I know he is.

595
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:53,284
Should be ready anytime now.

596
00:53:53,651 --> 00:53:57,796
As soon as it aligns, it should open
in an unobstructed area in your city

597
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,623
on your version of Earth.

598
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,283
Should?

599
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,910
Technology's very old.

600
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:05,563
Remember that number.
It's your way back here.

601
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:07,148
Got it.

602
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:08,658
Been there.

603
00:54:14,672 --> 00:54:15,714
Hey.

604
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:17,825
You Okay?

605
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:25,332
What's wrong?

606
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:55,797
We're losing power.

607
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:02,219
Sir, they're in the village.

608
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:17,222
Oh, no.

609
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,860
Faras.

610
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,124
Can you fix it?

611
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:21,746
We have spare parts in the village.

612
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:25,780
Jake.

613
00:55:26,205 --> 00:55:27,979
Go find somewhere close to hide,

614
00:55:28,304 --> 00:55:28,944
understand?

615
00:55:29,021 --> 00:55:30,021
Yeah.

616
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:47,448
Come on!
Move.

617
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:48,749
Get inside!

618
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:51,502
We need to go! Hurry!
Are you okay?

619
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:55,572
Go get weapons!

620
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:57,833
Which way?

621
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,635
In there.

622
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,613
He's there.

623
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:05,574
He's hurt.

624
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:08,160
My child! Please!

625
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:12,122
His guns are forged from the steel

626
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:14,667
of the sword of Arthur Eld himself.

627
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:19,630
I believe Keystoners call it Excalibur.

628
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:30,107
Please, just go!

629
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,954
Just get help, please!

630
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:43,843
We have to get out of here.
No, I've got to get them out!

631
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,869
No, no, please, we have to go!

632
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:47,909
Run.

633
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,055
Let's go!

634
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,146
Help me!

635
00:56:53,488 --> 00:56:54,748
Go get the parts.

636
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:56,041
Dad!

637
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:07,124
They were after our boy.

638
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:08,937
Why would they want our boy?

639
00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:45,758
Right.

640
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:48,397
Turn on the water pumps.

641
00:57:48,422 --> 00:57:49,443
Right away, sir.
Quickly.

642
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:51,246
No!
Let's try to get them out!

643
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:54,684
Okay, I'll take care of you!
All right.

644
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,578
There you are. All right?

645
00:57:58,145 --> 00:57:59,530
Come this way.

646
00:58:14,787 --> 00:58:16,698
You couldn't save him, Roland.

647
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:24,713
Sir, Shine.

648
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,390
That's the boy. Get him.

649
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:33,614
Jake.

650
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:45,409
Jake.

651
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,745
They're here for him.
I know.

652
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,035
Roland.

653
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:56,718
What are you doing?

654
00:58:56,743 --> 00:58:57,620
Quiet.

655
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:30,153
Roland. Please. Help me, please.

656
01:00:11,077 --> 01:00:12,245
Let's go! Let's go!

657
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:13,814
We need to leave.

658
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,090
He's not safe here.

659
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:17,826
And as long as he's here,
you aren't either.

660
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,377
We have this fight.

661
01:00:20,203 --> 01:00:22,139
Come on.
Go.

662
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:24,541
Jake.

663
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,002
Be careful using the Shine.
They're tracking you.

664
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,431
<i>Portal alignment complete.</i>

665
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:32,699
Come on.

666
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,514
No, it's not ready yet.

667
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:52,486
Knife.
He's a chef.

668
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,696
Come on.

669
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:07,051
So many people.

670
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,688
We need to get you help.

671
01:01:17,013 --> 01:01:18,061
Right now.

672
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,396
They had a portal.

673
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:30,273
I think they're gone.

674
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:48,709
Get me the coordinates.

675
01:01:52,587 --> 01:01:55,966
One last time around the wheel, old friend.

676
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:02,597
This is madness.

677
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:05,267
You can't walk into a hospital here
carrying guns.

678
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:07,002
Trust me. Come on.

679
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:12,574
Let me do all the talking.

680
01:02:16,689 --> 01:02:18,214
<i>Hi. You've reached Laurie, Lon and Jake.</i>

681
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,598
<i>Please leave a detailed message</i>

682
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,709
<i>and we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.</i>

683
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:24,369
<i>This is awful. Try it.</i>

684
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:27,176
<i>That looks gross. What is it?
You got to try it. It's terrible.</i>

685
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:28,987
<i>I don't want to try it if it's terrible.</i>

686
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,107
<i>It's like mango</i>

687
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,561
Do the animals here still speak?

688
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:35,573
What? No, that's a commercial.

689
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:41,787
Wait, what do you mean by still?

690
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,805
He's in here.

691
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:45,223
Mr. Deschain.

692
01:02:46,224 --> 01:02:48,143
I see the antibiotics are kicking in.

693
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,229
On a scale of one to 10,
how bad is your pain?

694
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,266
Okay.

695
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,110
And you were in very bad shape I'm...

696
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:59,071
surprised you're even sitting up.

697
01:02:59,237 --> 01:03:00,697
I'm stronger than most.

698
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,201
We get that sentiment a lot.

699
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:07,487
So aside from your infection
and the wound from the...

700
01:03:07,654 --> 01:03:09,656
costume-party incident

701
01:03:10,023 --> 01:03:14,360
we also found traces of hepatitis A,
B, E, and...

702
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:18,173
chronic radiation sickness.

703
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,744
Have you traveled overseas in
the past couple of months?

704
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:31,645
No. I've been here on Keystone Earth.

705
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:36,650
So am I cured or not?

706
01:03:36,777 --> 01:03:39,497
We're going to keep you here for
the night to monitor your progress.

707
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:41,188
Maybe tomorrow afternoon...
No.

708
01:03:41,212 --> 01:03:41,854
What are you doing? No.

709
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:43,489
I can't stay here.
You need to get back on that.

710
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,725
Mr. Deschain, you need.
For your services.

711
01:03:45,992 --> 01:03:46,993
Wait, what?

712
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,027
May your days be long.

713
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:49,245
But you need to get back on that.

714
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:50,989
Mr. Deschain?
Bring my guns.

715
01:03:52,782 --> 01:03:54,659
These are painkillers and vitamins.

716
01:03:56,711 --> 01:03:58,848
You only want to take one or two at a...

717
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,274
time.

718
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,175
Hey, cutie.

719
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:04,853
Can we join the party?

720
01:04:06,263 --> 01:04:09,182
You have both forgotten
the faces of your fathers.

721
01:04:11,409 --> 01:04:13,611
You probably shouldn't talk to people here.

722
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:24,840
What is this?

723
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:26,950
Sugar.

724
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:30,250
How we gonna find the portal?

725
01:04:30,675 --> 01:04:32,237
New York's a pretty big place.

726
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,590
I don't know.

727
01:04:33,756 --> 01:04:36,502
I just can't let Walter know
how I'm coming for him.

728
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:46,970
I've got an idea.

729
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:53,627
These painkillers work fast.

730
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:55,854
I haven't felt this good in years.

731
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:57,772
Yeah, we got the good stuff.

732
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:00,601
Got any more of that sugar?

733
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:04,070
There's nothing to be scared of.

734
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,865
I promise you, whatever happens

735
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:09,034
you'll be at peace.

736
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:12,204
You'll be...
A seer who lies.

737
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:15,457
The worst kind.

738
01:05:17,626 --> 01:05:19,636
I like you already.

739
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:22,714
Come now.

740
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:25,550
Good bye.

741
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:29,012
Talk.

742
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:34,491
Don't fight it.

743
01:05:35,016 --> 01:05:37,077
Where did he take the boy?

744
01:05:38,563 --> 01:05:39,606
Jake?

745
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:41,216
Chambers, yes. Where?

746
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,140
Key...

747
01:05:47,221 --> 01:05:47,896
Key...

748
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:50,216
Keystone Earth.

749
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:51,701
Thank you.

750
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,538
Hey, remember me?

751
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,261
You said they were crossing over kids.

752
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:12,555
You were one of them, weren't you?

753
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,760
I lost it.

754
01:06:15,585 --> 01:06:16,892
The Shine.

755
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,834
Which way did they take you through?

756
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:20,274
No.
Do you remember?

757
01:06:20,299 --> 01:06:21,914
You have to run.
A portal, a door.

758
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:23,833
It's almost over.
Anything, please.

759
01:06:23,857 --> 01:06:25,210
It's almost over. It's almost over.

760
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:27,070
It's almost over. It's almost over.

761
01:06:27,437 --> 01:06:28,598
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

762
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:31,458
<i>Remember. Show me.</i>

763
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:36,371
<i>Dixie.</i>

764
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:37,789
Jake!

765
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:39,967
Jake!

766
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,862
They can track the Shine.

767
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:45,272
Okay?

768
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,794
I know what you are.

769
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:53,889
Gunslinger.

770
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:56,542
Go.

771
01:07:02,188 --> 01:07:03,566
Should have enough to find it.

772
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:05,482
Just got to get home and
do some research.

773
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:06,698
Your home?

774
01:07:06,778 --> 01:07:08,669
Yeah, I got to let my mom know I'm okay.

775
01:07:09,654 --> 01:07:11,694
We have trackers spread
throughout the city.

776
01:07:12,123 --> 01:07:13,466
There's no trace of him yet, sir.

777
01:07:13,533 --> 01:07:15,660
Couple of small spikes, but
not enough to hone in on.

778
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:17,202
Don't you worry, Dicky-boy.

779
01:07:17,203 --> 01:07:18,813
I've got you covered.
Sir?

780
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,350
I left a surprise for our little friend.
Just be ready.

781
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:23,982
You should probably wait here.

782
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:25,194
Dude.

783
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:27,022
Where the hell have you been?
Timmy.

784
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:28,615
Who's that?

785
01:07:30,216 --> 01:07:31,409
I'll tell you later.

786
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:33,223
How's Mom and Lon?

787
01:07:33,648 --> 01:07:34,719
They must be freaking out.

788
01:07:34,887 --> 01:07:36,481
They haven't been home since yesterday.

789
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:41,085
Mom. Mom.

790
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:52,405
Mom?
Jake.

791
01:07:52,972 --> 01:07:54,265
Mom? Mom! Mom!
Jake!

792
01:07:57,619 --> 01:07:58,619
No.

793
01:07:59,537 --> 01:08:00,580
No, no.

794
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:04,542
No, no. No, no, no.

795
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:06,920
No, no, no.

796
01:08:07,587 --> 01:08:09,422
No, Mom. No, no, no.

797
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:12,258
No, no, Mom.

798
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:21,910
No.

799
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:24,938
No, no, Mom.

800
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,398
Drawings.
Mom.

801
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:27,732
I'll make it quick.

802
01:08:28,808 --> 01:08:29,808
Jake!

803
01:08:33,187 --> 01:08:34,187
No.

804
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:35,989
No, Jake.

805
01:08:36,557 --> 01:08:38,034
Don't see it.
Mom.

806
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:39,812
It's what he wants.

807
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:42,899
He's tracking you.

808
01:08:43,124 --> 01:08:44,348
She's dead.

809
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,817
Close your mind.

810
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:49,045
Close your mind.
Let the pain run through you, Jake.

811
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:51,514
He killed her.

812
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:54,050
I know. I know.
He killed her.

813
01:08:58,388 --> 01:08:59,389
Come here.

814
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:32,572
I will kill him.

815
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:35,508
For both of us.

816
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:45,035
What about the Tower?

817
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:53,969
My mom died so you could
have your revenge?

818
01:09:58,823 --> 01:10:00,567
Maybe your world is almost gone,

819
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:01,817
but mine isn't.

820
01:10:01,959 --> 01:10:03,004
You said it yourself,

821
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:06,523
as long as the darkness is out there
the Tower's always in danger.

822
01:10:10,877 --> 01:10:12,421
You know, they were right.

823
01:10:15,882 --> 01:10:18,051
You're not a Gunslinger.

824
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:23,848
Here.

825
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:26,267
It's called the Dixie Pig.

826
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,061
It's on Plymouth and Pearl.

827
01:10:43,993 --> 01:10:45,379
When I was younger,

828
01:10:47,914 --> 01:10:50,267
I would recite the Gunslinger's Creed.

829
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,397
It calms the heart and the mind.

830
01:10:57,507 --> 01:10:59,568
I haven't spoken it for years.

831
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:25,427
I do not aim with my hand.

832
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:29,539
He who aims with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

833
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:33,142
I aim with my eye.

834
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:38,398
I do not shoot with my hand.

835
01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:42,627
He who shoots with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.

836
01:11:43,094 --> 01:11:45,096
I shoot with my mind.

837
01:11:58,067 --> 01:12:00,028
I do not kill with my gun.

838
01:12:00,194 --> 01:12:03,622
He who kills with his gun
has forgotten the face of his father.

839
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:06,117
Not while the Tower still stands.

840
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:07,493
Not while you still stand.

841
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,787
I kill with my heart.
I kill with my heart.

842
01:12:19,922 --> 01:12:21,458
That's good.

843
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:24,385
Your Shine is your weapon, Jake.

844
01:12:26,929 --> 01:12:28,431
Guns are mine.

845
01:12:45,406 --> 01:12:47,075
Can I help you fellas?

846
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:50,778
Hey.
Forty-five-caliber bullets.

847
01:12:52,038 --> 01:12:54,290
I only have...
We'll take them all.

848
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:56,434
Just do what he says.
He won't hurt you.

849
01:12:56,501 --> 01:12:57,952
I don't want any trouble.

850
01:12:58,419 --> 01:13:00,088
Well, then you're smarter than most.

851
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:01,656
Hurry up.

852
01:13:13,184 --> 01:13:15,444
All right, let's get you somewhere safe.

853
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,347
Gunslinger.

854
01:13:20,566 --> 01:13:21,993
Did you miss me?

855
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:27,532
Well, I guess you did.

856
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:29,492
Roland! Roland, Roland.

857
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:30,910
Jake, run.

858
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:32,537
Run!

859
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:44,290
I see you finally found a compass,

860
01:13:44,915 --> 01:13:46,549
yet you still came to me.

861
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:49,245
Because I'm your only destination, Roland.

862
01:13:51,013 --> 01:13:52,348
Fire away.

863
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:55,345
It's not me.

864
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:56,693
I'm not doing this.

865
01:13:59,605 --> 01:14:01,682
First, you want to save the Tower.

866
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:04,852
Then, kill the Man in Black.

867
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:12,001
You are like a dog fetching
a stick over and over.

868
01:14:12,368 --> 01:14:14,871
You tell the kid what
happened to the old crew?

869
01:14:15,037 --> 01:14:18,841
You tell him that everyone that
walks with you dies by my hand?

870
01:14:19,008 --> 01:14:20,159
Not this time.

871
01:14:20,326 --> 01:14:22,119
Your soft-skinned mother?

872
01:14:22,286 --> 01:14:24,205
Your Gunslinger friends?
Face me.

873
01:14:24,272 --> 01:14:25,857
Your whimpering excuse for a dad.

874
01:14:26,323 --> 01:14:29,785
Stop hiding behind your magic
and face me, Walter!

875
01:14:31,304 --> 01:14:34,631
We both know that no matter
who crosses the finish line first,

876
01:14:34,632 --> 01:14:37,035
the universe will die out eventually.

877
01:14:37,935 --> 01:14:40,188
Death always wins.

878
01:14:40,354 --> 01:14:41,964
That's the deal.

879
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:51,658
No, no.

880
01:14:54,744 --> 01:14:55,787
<i>Roland.</i>

881
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,189
<i>Roland.</i>

882
01:15:19,936 --> 01:15:22,355
Yeah!

883
01:15:29,904 --> 01:15:32,824
Jake Chambers.

884
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:43,131
You are the full package,

885
01:15:43,656 --> 01:15:45,360
as advertised.

886
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:48,040
Sayre,

887
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:49,856
get ready.

888
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:52,944
Tall, dark and handsome is about
to crash the party.

889
01:16:13,573 --> 01:16:15,741
Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

890
01:16:15,908 --> 01:16:16,993
Take one and go.

891
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:26,335
Alrighty. Let's go put everyone
out of their misery, shall we?

892
01:16:26,702 --> 01:16:27,887
Any time, champ.

893
01:16:46,063 --> 01:16:47,398
<i>Roland.</i>

894
01:16:55,281 --> 01:16:56,824
<i>Roland</i>

895
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:58,784
<i>they're taking me to that place.</i>

896
01:16:58,951 --> 01:17:00,453
<i>Be careful.</i>

897
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,787
Hang on.

898
01:17:02,254 --> 01:17:03,672
I'm coming for you.

899
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:19,847
We'll get him, sir.

900
01:17:20,222 --> 01:17:21,222
Bye.

901
01:17:23,851 --> 01:17:25,437
Have a great apocalypse.

902
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:29,874
Close in on him!

903
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:35,446
Okay

904
01:17:50,544 --> 01:17:51,754
Let's go.
Sir.

905
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:53,098
We're online!

906
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:04,507
It's really gonna happen, isn't it?

907
01:18:04,531 --> 01:18:06,109
Oh, yes, it is.

908
01:19:22,803 --> 01:19:24,347
Something's wrong.

909
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,795
Something's wrong here.

910
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,734
The levels are plateauing.

911
01:19:29,977 --> 01:19:32,179
It's as if he's...
Fighting back.

912
01:19:34,148 --> 01:19:35,700
Why do you resist?

913
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:39,307
Your visions didn't bring you
to him, they brought you to me.

914
01:19:39,695 --> 01:19:41,854
He doesn't love you.
He doesn't care for you.

915
01:19:41,855 --> 01:19:45,092
In fact, he's been using you
this entire time to get to me.

916
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:46,756
This is why you're here.

917
01:19:46,981 --> 01:19:48,611
This is your destiny.

918
01:19:48,954 --> 01:19:50,456
You killed my mom!

919
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:52,983
Yes, that's it. There we go.

920
01:20:52,217 --> 01:20:54,027
Portal. Close it.

921
01:20:56,522 --> 01:20:57,573
Close it!

922
01:20:57,698 --> 01:20:58,764
I can't!

923
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:01,944
Wait.

924
01:21:04,071 --> 01:21:06,490
Oh, my God. It's the kid.

925
01:21:06,657 --> 01:21:09,993
It's the kid!
He's keeping the portal open!

926
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:12,689
Impressive.

927
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:22,089
So you wanted me to face you, old friend?

928
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:25,801
Here I am.

929
01:22:15,809 --> 01:22:18,979
It's fitting that you
and the Tower should fall together.

930
01:23:10,406 --> 01:23:11,448
<i>Roland.</i>

931
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:16,370
<i>Roland, get up.</i>

932
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:24,211
<i>I do not aim with my hand.</i>

933
01:23:24,378 --> 01:23:27,965
<i>He who aims with his hand has
forgotten the face of his father.</i>

934
01:23:28,757 --> 01:23:30,259
<i>I aim with my eye.</i>

935
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:37,725
<i>I do not shoot with my hand.</i>

936
01:23:37,891 --> 01:23:39,518
<i>He who shoots with his hand</i>

937
01:23:39,685 --> 01:23:42,363
Has forgotten the face of his father.

938
01:23:43,731 --> 01:23:45,040
<i>I shoot with my mind.</i>

939
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:47,026
I shoot with my mind.

940
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,596
<i>I do not kill with my gun.</i>

941
01:23:52,489 --> 01:23:54,616
He who kills with his gun.

942
01:23:54,783 --> 01:23:56,503
<i>Has forgotten the face of his father.</i>

943
01:23:56,577 --> 01:23:59,030
Has forgotten the face of his father.

944
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:06,837
I kill with my heart.

945
01:25:46,812 --> 01:25:48,230
Mom, Dad.

946
01:25:48,397 --> 01:25:49,898
There they are.
Sweetheart.

947
01:25:50,265 --> 01:25:52,025
I'm so glad you're here.

948
01:26:11,295 --> 01:26:11,896
Here.

949
01:26:12,321 --> 01:26:13,422
What is this?

950
01:26:13,464 --> 01:26:14,916
Thank you.
Thanks. Hot dog.

951
01:26:15,883 --> 01:26:17,276
Savages.

952
01:26:19,595 --> 01:26:20,679
What breed?

953
01:26:21,046 --> 01:26:22,631
No, it's not a breed.

954
01:26:30,189 --> 01:26:31,615
I have to leave here, Jake.

955
01:26:33,192 --> 01:26:34,860
You understand that, don't you?

956
01:26:36,403 --> 01:26:37,563
I know.

957
01:26:45,245 --> 01:26:46,580
Why don't you come with me?

958
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:52,686
Really?

959
01:26:54,046 --> 01:26:55,423
You have nothing here.

960
01:26:56,089 --> 01:26:59,051
Besides I could, use your help.

961
01:27:01,553 --> 01:27:03,430
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

962
01:27:04,264 --> 01:27:05,441
Gunslinger.

963
