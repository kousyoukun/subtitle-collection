1
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,837
Your attention, please.

2
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:16,341
Announcing the departure of
American Airlines westbound Flight 9.

3
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:21,304
Flight 9 now loading at Gate 3
for immediate departure.

4
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:24,389
-Yes, sir?
-You got anything going to Boone City?

5
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:27,726
Boone City, three daily flights,
but there's no space available.

6
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,352
-Would you care to make a reservation?
-Yes, I would.

7
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,190
-Your name, please?
-Derry. D-E-R-R-Y. Fred.

8
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:35,524
How long will it be?

9
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:38,610
We can probably get you
on Flight 37 on the 19th.

10
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:41,446
The 19th?
See, listen, I can't wait that long.

11
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,739
I just got back from oversea.
I wanna get home.

12
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:45,532
I'm sorry. There's a waiting list.

13
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:48,410
My secretary made arrangements
to have my tickets here.

14
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,328
My name is Gibbons.
George H. Gibbons.

15
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:52,371
-Yes, they're right here.
-Thank you.

16
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:54,916
-May we weigh your baggage, please?
-Yes, excuse me.

17
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,459
-Put them right there, please.
-Sorry.

18
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,215
You might try the ATC, Captain.

19
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,591
ATC, where are they?

20
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,176
Out the terminal
to your right and across the field.

21
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:09,844
Thanks.

22
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,555
You have 16 pounds excess baggage,
Mr. Gibbons.

23
00:02:12,722 --> 00:02:15,224
Oh, that's all right. How much is it?

24
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:38,118
Right-o, sir.

25
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:41,079
At ease, men.

26
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:46,750
Flight 93. Flight 93. For Denver,
San Francisco and Seattle.

27
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,754
That flight has been canceled
until further notice.

28
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:54,882
-Yeah.
-You got anything for Detroit?

29
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,386
-Nope, how about Cleveland?
-Cleveland?

30
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:00,220
Okay.

31
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:03,431
-Fill this out.
-Guess I'm going to Cleveland.

32
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,560
-It's a nice town.
-Yeah, but Detroit's where I live.

33
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,563
Sarge, what's the chances
of a ride to Boone City?

34
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,480
You got orders?

35
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:15,608
-Sure.
-Okay.

36
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:20,612
I haven't got anything now, but fill this out,
I'll call you if anything comes up.

37
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:23,365
Okay, I guess I'll wait.

38
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:30,079
Guys, I need a couple of men
to give me a hand with this out to a plane.

39
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:31,788
-Okay.
-Hey, come on. Let's go.

40
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:33,748
Let's go, huh?

41
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,042
I bet this thing weighs a ton.

42
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,587
What's the matter, sailor?
Tired or something?

43
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,006
Okay, let's go. Out this way.

44
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,718
Fellas, take it easy down the stairs.

45
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:48,052
-Got it?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,012
There you go. Hey, look out, fellas.

47
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:53,807
-Take it easy going down the stairs.
-Oh, my aching back.

48
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,642
Derry.

49
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:59,854
-Derry. Captain Fred Derry.
-Oh, coming.

50
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:03,148
-Parrish. Homer Parrish.
-Here.

51
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:04,566
-You Derry?
-Yeah.

52
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:05,942
-Parrish?
-Right.

53
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:09,653
Got a call from Baseops.
There's a B-17 taking off for Boone City.

54
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,239
You'll have a long ride.
She's making a lot of stops.

55
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,325
You'll get there tomorrow. That suit you?

56
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:17,494
-Sure, that's swell.
-Okay, sign here.

57
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:20,538
Boy, it sure is great to be going home.

58
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:23,832
-Here you go, sailor.
-Sign on the dotted--

59
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:27,169
I'll do it for you.

60
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:29,670
What's the matter?
Think I can't spell my own name?

61
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,006
No, I just thought that....

62
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,800
I know, sarge. Thanks.

63
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,935
Hey, Joe. You better hurry up out there,
because she's taking off soon.

64
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,686
Right, thanks. Come on, sailor.

65
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,648
-Where's your stuff?
-Right here.

66
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:53,482
Excuse us, corporal.

67
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,362
-Boone City your home, sailor?
-Yes, sir, captain.

68
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:00,822
Forget the rank, chum. I'm out.

69
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:04,117
-Whereabouts do you live in Boone?
-Over on West 17th Street.

70
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,119
-You know where Jackson High is?
-Sure.

71
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:08,870
-Go ahead.
-Well, it's just a couple of blocks past it.

72
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:23,299
-Hi, sarge.
-How are you?

73
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:29,221
-My name's Fred Derry.
-Al Stephenson.

74
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:32,473
-And this is Homer.... What is it, Homer?
-Parrish.

75
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,642
-Glad to know you.
-Glad to know you, sarge.

76
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,602
-You from Boone too?
-Yeah, sure I am.

77
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:40,730
-How long since you've been home?
-A couple of centuries.

78
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,233
Come on, we'll sit in the radio compartment
until after the takeoff...

79
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,735
...then we'll get in the nose
and get a nice view of the good old U.S.A.

80
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:48,279
Okay.

81
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:00,622
Boy, oh, boy. Hey, look at that.
Look at those automobiles down there.

82
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,375
You can see them so plain,
you can even see the people.

83
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,252
Yeah, looks like we're flying by road map.

84
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,338
-Is this your first ride in one of these?
-Yeah, this is my first plane ride.

85
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,174
I saw plenty of flying, all right.

86
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,052
I was on a CV. That's a flattop.

87
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:19,597
But I never knew things
looked so pretty from up here.

88
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,682
Sure is beautiful.

89
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,977
I never thought so.
This used to be my office.

90
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:27,812
-Bombardier, weren't you?
-Yeah.

91
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,980
That's where the bombsight was.

92
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:32,775
I spent a lot of time on my knees
up there.

93
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:36,611
-Praying?
-Yeah, that too.

94
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,575
-Cigarette, Homer?
-Thanks. It's all right, I can get it.

95
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:53,459
Here, I've got a match, captain.

96
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,303
Thank you.

97
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,931
-Thank you.
-Anybody superstitious?

98
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:13,059
-No, no, go ahead.
-Well, I am.

99
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,947
Boy, you ought to see
me open a bottle of beer.

100
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:31,991
-Well, then you got nothing to worry about.
-Thanks.

101
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:33,992
I guess you saw a lot of action.

102
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:37,871
No, I didn't see much of the war.
I mean the way you fellas did.

103
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:39,497
You trying to kid the Army?

104
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:42,375
No, I was stationed
in the repair shop below decks.

105
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,377
Oh, I was in plenty of battles.

106
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,712
But I never saw a Jap
or heard a shell coming at me.

107
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,091
When we were sunk, all I know
is there was a lot of fire and explosions.

108
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:56,554
And I was ordered topsides and overboard,
and I was burned.

109
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,349
When I came to,
I was on a cruiser and my hands were off.

110
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:03,309
After that, I had it easy.

111
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:05,394
-Easy?
-That's what I said.

112
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,521
They took care of me fine.

113
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,690
They trained me to use these things.

114
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:15,111
I can dial telephones, I can drive a car,
I can even put nickels in a jukebox.

115
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,779
I'm all right. But....

116
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,784
But what, sailor?

117
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:25,453
Well....

118
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,539
Well, you see, I've got a girl.

119
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,543
She knows what happened to you,
doesn't she?

120
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,045
Sure. They all know.

121
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,964
But they don't know
what these things look like.

122
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,468
-What's your girl's name, Homer?
-Wilma.

123
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:45,470
She and I went to high school together.

124
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:49,514
-I bet Wilma's a swell girl.
-She is.

125
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:52,684
And it'll be all right, sailor.
You wait and see.

126
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:55,770
Yeah. Wait and see.

127
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,229
Wilma's only a kid.

128
00:08:57,396 --> 00:09:00,316
She's never seen anything
like these hooks.

129
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:09,740
Say, wait till I get home
and tell the folks about this trip.

130
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:13,952
I'm the first one in my family
that ever rode in an aeroplane.

131
00:09:38,473 --> 00:09:41,016
-Hey, Al.
-Yeah?

132
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:44,395
You remember what it felt like
when you went overseas?

133
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,021
As well as I remember my own name.

134
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:49,774
I feel the same way now.

135
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:52,443
Only more so.

136
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:55,529
I know what you mean.

137
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:59,782
Just nervous out of the service, I guess.

138
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:05,745
The thing that scares me most is that
everybody's gonna try to rehabilitate me.

139
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:09,833
All I want's a good job, a mild future...

140
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:12,292
...and a house big enough for me
and my wife.

141
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,213
Give me that much
and I'm rehabilitated like that.

142
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:20,091
I'd say that's not too much to ask.

143
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,969
You married, Al?

144
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,179
-Yep.
-How long?

145
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,974
Twenty years.

146
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:32,393
Twenty years?

147
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,106
Holy smoke.

148
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:43,737
We didn't even have 20 days
before I went over.

149
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:47,948
I married a girl I met
when I was in training in Texas.

150
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,325
Well, you and your wife will
have a chance to get acquainted.

151
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:53,119
Yeah.

152
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:02,669
I wonder how
Homer will make out with that girl of his.

153
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,545
Wilma.

154
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,841
I hope Wilma is a swell girl.

155
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:08,724
-The old hometown hasn't changed much.
-No.

156
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:12,770
There's the golf course.

157
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:14,979
People are playing golf.

158
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:17,982
Just as if nothing had ever happened.

159
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:23,070
Hey, there's Jackson High football field.

160
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:28,199
Boy, I sure would like to have a dollar
for every forward pass I threw down there.

161
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:33,578
Good old Jackson High.

162
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,461
-Hey, that must be the new airport.
-Yeah, we're turning into it now.

163
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:45,672
Holy smoke.

164
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:50,427
I never knew there were so many planes.

165
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:52,136
And they're junking them.

166
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,012
-What?
-No.

167
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,849
Boy, oh, boy.

168
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:59,434
What we could have done
with those in '43.

169
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,978
Yeah, I'll bet.

170
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:06,440
Some of them look brand new.
From the factory to the scrapheap.

171
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:08,442
That's all they're good for now.

172
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:12,820
We gotta get out of the nose
while he sets her down.

173
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:25,914
Hey, look there's the ballpark.

174
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,836
Say, how are the Beavers
doing this season?

175
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,380
They're in sixth place.

176
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:37,466
Still in second division.

177
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,657
-Hey, there's Butch's Place.
-Butch's?

178
00:14:06,824 --> 00:14:10,118
-Who's that?
-Gosh, Butch has got himself a neon sign.

179
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:11,912
-Have you ever been to Butch's?
-No.

180
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,789
Oh, Butch Engle that runs it, he's my uncle.
Swell guy.

181
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,334
Only the family don't think
he's respectable because he sells liquor.

182
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:21,586
-That's the best joint in town.
-We'll have to get together there.

183
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,171
Swell.

184
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,719
This is my street.

185
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:33,763
Fifteen, 17.

186
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,973
It's the fourth house from here.

187
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,435
I wonder if Wilma's home.

188
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,073
How about the three of us
going back to Butch's Place?

189
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,034
We'll have a couple of drinks
and then we can go home.

190
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,452
You're home now, kid.

191
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,211
-Well, so long.
-So long, Homer.

192
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,927
-Where next?
-Just a minute, bud.

193
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:28,226
It's Homer! Momma! Momma! Daddy!
It's Homer! Homer's here!

194
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:32,229
Wilma! Wilma! Homer's here!

195
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,982
Wilma, come on over!

196
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,494
-My boy.
-Oh, darling.

197
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,912
It's good to see you.

198
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:57,208
-Isn't this wonderful?
-There's Wilma.

199
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:27,401
Okay, let's go.

200
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,584
-Well....
-No, don't. I'll carry it.

201
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,587
What's the matter, Ma?

202
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,048
It's nothing.

203
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:56,342
It's just that your ma's
so glad to see you home.

204
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:58,302
Yeah, I know.

205
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:16,317
You gotta hand it to the Navy.

206
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:19,569
They sure trained that kid
how to use those hooks.

207
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:25,574
They couldn't train him to put
his arms around his girl, to stroke her hair.

208
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,163
-Is it the next turn up here?
-Yeah, the next turn on the left.

209
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:37,836
Hey, Fred, why don't we drop you first?

210
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:40,963
No, you're next.

211
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:45,675
And we're not going back to Butch's
for a drink, either.

212
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:49,095
Feel as if I were going in to hit a beach.

213
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:09,612
Some barracks you got here.
Hey, what are you, a retired bootlegger?

214
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,116
Nothing as dignified as that.
I'm a banker.

215
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:16,534
How much do I owe you?

216
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:19,579
Take your hand out of your pocket,
sergeant. You're outranked.

217
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:22,081
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

218
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:25,292
-Good luck, chum.
-Thanks.

219
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,479
Yes, I will. Yes, sir.

220
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:51,939
One moment, please.
One moment, please.

221
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:54,566
-Just whom do you wish to see?
-Mrs. Stephenson.

222
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,527
Well, just a minute.
I'll have to announce you first.

223
00:18:57,694 --> 00:19:00,238
You put that phone down.
I'm her husband.

224
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,783
-You're Mr. Stephenson?
-Sergeant Stephenson.

225
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:06,744
What did you expect?
A four-star general?

226
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:12,749
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Yes, sir.

227
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,793
-Fourth floor.
-Yes, sir.

228
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,619
I'll get it, Peg.

229
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,708
Where's Mom?

230
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:08,379
Who's that at the door, Peggy?

231
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:12,173
Peggy.

232
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,634
Rob, who was--?

233
00:21:08,763 --> 00:21:12,016
-I look terrible.
-Who says so?

234
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:16,353
-It isn't fair of you to bust in on us like this.
-I phoned you from Portland.

235
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,521
Yes, but you said
you wouldn't be home for--

236
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:21,107
We were lucky.
We got a plane to Welburn.

237
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:25,486
I thought we were gonna get stuck there,
but we came right through.

238
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,696
-Al, are you all right?
-Sure.

239
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:32,617
-Are you all right?
-Of course I am.

240
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:45,628
-Let me look at you.
-Don't look now, I need a bath and a shave.

241
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:51,591
If you don't mind, Mom.

242
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:56,261
Dad. Darling.

243
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:02,058
I'd better call the Kenworthys and
tell them we won't be over.

244
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:04,560
-The Kenworthys?
-Yes.

245
00:22:05,727 --> 00:22:09,273
My son. And my daughter.

246
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,817
I don't recognize you. What's happened?

247
00:22:11,984 --> 00:22:15,236
Just a few years of normal growth.
Don't you approve?

248
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:16,654
I don't know yet.

249
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:19,531
I've gotta have more time
to get to know you.

250
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:21,533
Hello?

251
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,077
Oh, Alice, this is Milly.

252
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:27,913
I'm terribly sorry, but we can't be over.

253
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:33,459
I mean, I'm terribly happy.

254
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:37,422
You see, Al....

255
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,924
My husband.

256
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:46,262
Yes. He's home. Yes.

257
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,558
Yes.

258
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,959
-Freddy.
-Hello, Hortense.

259
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:26,546
Well, say. Pat.

260
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,132
Pat, it's Freddy. He's home again.

261
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,176
Hello, Pop.

262
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:34,136
Gee, I wish we'd known
you were coming.

263
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:36,763
We'd have had
the place kind of cleaned up.

264
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:41,642
Well, haven't you got anything to say
to your own son?

265
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:45,354
-Glad to see you, my boy.
-Look at him, Pat.

266
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,230
Look at your hero son.

267
00:23:47,397 --> 00:23:49,815
And look at all those
beautiful ribbons on his chest.

268
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:53,986
Go on, Freddy, tell your father how you
got those ribbons and what they mean.

269
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:56,154
-Where's Marie?
-Marie?

270
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:57,822
Yeah, she out?

271
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:00,491
-Oh, Marie isn't here, Freddy.
-Will she be back soon?

272
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:04,954
Well, she's not living with us anymore,
Freddy. She took an apartment downtown.

273
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,829
Why didn't anybody write me about it?

274
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:10,291
Well, we were afraid it might worry you,
you being so far away.

275
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:14,419
And it was inconvenient for Marie
living in this place after she took that job.

276
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,839
But we forwarded all your letters
and the allotment checks.

277
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:20,716
She took a job? Where?

278
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:23,511
Some nightclub.
I don't know just which one.

279
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:26,137
Oh, the poor girl works till all hours.

280
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:28,139
Where does she live?

281
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,685
Grandview Arms on Pine Street.

282
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:34,687
But there's nothing to worry about, Freddy.
Marie's fine.

283
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:39,023
We saw her last Christmas.
She brought us some beautiful presents.

284
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,608
Marie's a good-hearted girl.

285
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:42,694
You know what time
she goes out to work?

286
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,698
Well, about suppertime, I imagine.

287
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:50,826
Do you mind if I leave my stuff here?

288
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:52,618
I'll pick it up later.

289
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,705
Sure, but aren't you gonna stay
and have a bite to eat?

290
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:58,081
No, thank you, Hortense.

291
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,000
Well....

292
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,168
So long, Pop. I'll be back.

293
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,087
Well, it's....
I'm glad to have you home, my boy.

294
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,382
It's good to be home, Pop. Bye.

295
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,137
Here, a cap.

296
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,057
Here's a samurai sword, Rob.

297
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:22,728
Thanks very much, Dad.

298
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,107
And here's a flag
I found on a dead Jap soldier.

299
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:31,985
All that writing on it are signatures
and good luck messages from his relatives.

300
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:33,194
Yes, I know.

301
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:37,239
The Japanese attach a lot of importance
to their family relationship.

302
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:40,492
Yeah. Yeah, entirely different from us.

303
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:43,661
Say, you were at Hiroshima,
weren't you, Dad?

304
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:45,121
Did you happen to notice...

305
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:49,750
...any of the effects of radioactivity
on the people who survived the blast?

306
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,585
No, I didn't. Should I have?

307
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:55,379
Well, we've been having lectures
in atomic energy at school.

308
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:57,590
And Mr. McLaglen,
he's our physics teacher...

309
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,759
...he says that we've reached the point...

310
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:04,012
...where the whole human race has either
got to find a way to live together...

311
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,557
-...or else....
-Or else.

312
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,516
That's right. Or else.

313
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:12,811
Because when you combine
atomic energy with jet propulsion...

314
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:17,774
...and radar and guided missiles,
well, just think of the....

315
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:20,776
Oh, you're just kidding me, Dad.

316
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:24,363
You've been to all these places
and you've seen everything.

317
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:26,740
I've seen nothing.

318
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:31,953
I should have stayed home
and found out what was really going on.

319
00:26:32,453 --> 00:26:34,412
I finished the dishes.

320
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:38,083
Why do you have to do that?
Is this the maid's night out?

321
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:42,127
Our maid took a night out
three years ago, we haven't seen her since.

322
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:45,547
But everything's all right because
I took a course in domestic science.

323
00:26:45,714 --> 00:26:48,007
-Even bought a cook book.
-What's happened?

324
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,636
All this atomic energy
and scientific efficiency.

325
00:26:51,803 --> 00:26:54,304
It was the war. You heard about that.

326
00:26:54,471 --> 00:26:55,681
Yeah.

327
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,683
All those problems on the home front.

328
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,101
We used to read about them
in Stars and Stripes.

329
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:02,645
We felt awfully sorry for the civilians.

330
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:04,647
You don't have to worry about us, Dad.

331
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:07,607
We can handle the problems.
We're tough.

332
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:12,653
Rob, haven't you any homework?

333
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,031
Oh, sure. Good night, Dad.

334
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:17,825
Don't see why you have to go now.

335
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:21,786
Rob, aren't you going to take
the souvenirs father brought you?

336
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:23,830
Oh, yes.

337
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:27,958
Gee, thanks an awful lot, Dad,
for these things.

338
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,793
Good night. See you in the morning.

339
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,711
Good night, Rob.

340
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:35,381
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, darling.

341
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:39,593
Nice to have you around, Dad.
You'll get us back to normal.

342
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:43,846
Or maybe go nuts myself.

343
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,692
What do you think of the children?

344
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:01,194
The children?

345
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,363
I don't recognize them.

346
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,616
They've grown so old.

347
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:08,075
I tried to stop them...

348
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:13,079
...to keep them just as they were
when you left, but they got away from me.

349
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:27,926
-I guess Peggy has a lot of boyfriends.
-She's very popular.

350
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:30,135
Is she concentrating
on anyone particular?

351
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:32,721
She hasn't told me of anyone.

352
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:34,972
But you've...

353
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:38,726
...told her all the things
she ought to know?

354
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:42,812
What, for instance?

355
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,651
Well, have you?

356
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:52,196
She's worked two years in a hospital.

357
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,865
She knows more than you or I ever will.

358
00:28:58,034 --> 00:28:59,077
Cigarette?

359
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:02,204
-Have you forgotten, Al? I don't smoke.
-Sorry.

360
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,581
It's all right, darling.

361
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:11,337
-It's frightening.
-What is?

362
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:14,381
Youth.

363
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:17,300
Didn't you run across any young people
in the Army?

364
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:22,596
-No, they were all old men like me.
-Yes.

365
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,974
It's terrible to be old, isn't it?

366
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:32,312
-Why don't you sit down and relax?
-I'm perfectly relaxed standing up.

367
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,942
Is there such a thing as a drink
in this house?

368
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,859
I'll see.

369
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:55,165
We haven't got enough bacon
for Dad's breakfast.

370
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,750
I'll go out first thing in the morning
and get some.

371
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,169
Is this all the liquor we have left?

372
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:02,797
Gosh, I'm afraid so.

373
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,301
I wish he'd given us some warning
he was going to get here today.

374
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:09,761
Don't worry, Mom.

375
00:30:10,094 --> 00:30:14,265
I mean so that we could have gotten in
some supplies of things.

376
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:17,350
Mother.

377
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:19,477
I know it's a little difficult...

378
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,147
...but that's only because Dad's so crazy
about you.

379
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:27,401
He's been away so long
and missed you so terribly.

380
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:30,695
He can't just walk in
and immediately pick up the old life as if--

381
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,157
Hey, I got a wonderful idea.
Let's go out on the town, the three of us.

382
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:35,991
-Tonight?
-Yes, tonight. Right now.

383
00:30:36,158 --> 00:30:38,035
We'll celebrate
the old man's homecoming.

384
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,913
-Not me. I'm going to bed.
-No. You too. The three of us.

385
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:43,372
I wanna do something, see something.

386
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:46,375
And I've been in jungles
and around savages so long...

387
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,877
...I gotta find out
I'm back in civilization again.

388
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,653
Hey, Rupert,
how about another one here?

389
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:39,378
Well, I'll tell you...

390
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:42,214
...as I see it, we're headed
for bad times in this country.

391
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:44,883
Of course, we're in the backwash
of the war boom now...

392
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,968
...but the tide is running out fast.

393
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:51,222
Next year, in my opinion, we'll see
widespread depression and unemployment.

394
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:53,390
Oh, have a cigar?

395
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:56,226
No, thanks. I've got my pipe.

396
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:59,311
Homer? Didn't you contract
the tobacco habit in the Navy?

397
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:02,189
Just cigarettes, Mr. Cameron. Thanks.

398
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:07,402
Wilma tells us
you were in the Philippines, Homer.

399
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:10,989
Well, I was around there, Mrs. Cameron,
but I never saw anything.

400
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:15,576
-Did you meet General MacArthur?
-No, I didn't get to meet him.

401
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:17,618
I've got a light, Mr. Cameron.

402
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,745
No, that's all right.

403
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:21,330
Got it.

404
00:32:28,587 --> 00:32:30,546
-Luella.
-Yes, Dad?

405
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:39,220
You know, I've always thought
he's such a handsome man.

406
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:42,223
-Who?
-General MacArthur.

407
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:48,770
-May I help you with that, Mrs. Parrish?
-No, Wilma, you sit right down.

408
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:51,397
-Lemonade, Mrs. Cameron?
-Thank you very much.

409
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:53,983
Have you thought anything
about getting a job, Homer?

410
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,942
-Well, I....
-Oh, Father...

411
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,820
...it's much too soon for Homer
to be thinking about a job.

412
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:00,947
He's just out of the hospital.

413
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,698
Yes, I know...

414
00:33:02,865 --> 00:33:06,785
...but a few months from now, the same
opportunities won't exist that exist today.

415
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,662
You might think about my business, Homer.
Insurance.

416
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:13,124
We've taken on a number of veterans.
They make good salesmen, you know.

417
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,835
Men who have suffered
from some kind of disability.

418
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:19,963
Come down to the office one of these days,
we'll talk it over.

419
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:24,967
I'm sorry, Mom.

420
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:28,470
That's quite all right, Homer.
It won't hurt the carpet a bit.

421
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:31,389
Luella, you skin out to the kitchen
and get me a dishrag.

422
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:34,308
There's another one for you, Homer.

423
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:37,978
Wilma will hold it for you.

424
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:39,313
No, thanks.

425
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,149
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go out and walk around a bit.

426
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,538
Where's Homer?

427
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,499
He went out.

428
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,137
Pick Up Cafe. There it is, driver.
Stop right here.

429
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:20,681
Listen, Al, all kidding aside.

430
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:22,850
Don't you think it's time
to get some sleep?

431
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:26,602
Absolutely. Sleep. But first we've gotta
stop and have one last little drink.

432
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:29,772
And that's all you are gonna get.
No arguments. One drink.

433
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:31,857
Come on in, driver,
and have one with us.

434
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:01,465
Hey, Homer.

435
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,466
It's good to see you, kid.

436
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:06,887
Your friend told me you were home,
but I didn't expect you--

437
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:08,763
Hi, captain!

438
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:12,266
Hey, Homer, my old shipmate.
How are you kid? Sit down.

439
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:13,893
So you took my advice?

440
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:16,144
-Yeah.
-Come on, let's have a drink.

441
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:17,896
-Hello, Homer.
-Hi, Steve.

442
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:20,064
Boy, am I happy
to see you back home again.

443
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:23,358
Go ahead, shake, pal. It won't bite you.

444
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,694
-What'll you have?
-What'll I have?

445
00:35:25,861 --> 00:35:28,405
How many times have I dreamed
of hearing that question?

446
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:31,741
Before I went in the Navy,
Butch would never let me drink any liquor.

447
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:34,202
He used to read me lectures
on the curse of drink.

448
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,620
But it's different now. I'm a veteran.

449
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:38,997
Give me a whiskey, Steve. Straight.

450
00:35:39,164 --> 00:35:40,457
How about it, Butch?

451
00:35:40,624 --> 00:35:42,458
Draw a beer for the Navy.

452
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:44,585
-Butch, I ordered whiskey.
-Beer.

453
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:45,753
Beer.

454
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,756
I'm gonna take my trade to some other joint
where I don't have relatives.

455
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:53,593
Say, what are you doing here, anyway?
Why aren't you home with the folks?

456
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,887
Well, they went to bed
and I wasn't sleepy...

457
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:00,015
...so I thought,
"Why not come down and see Butch?"

458
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:02,266
Glad you did, Homer.

459
00:36:03,142 --> 00:36:05,603
Well, here's to you, Butch.

460
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:10,440
How am I doing?

461
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:14,860
-Kid, you're doing great.
-Thanks.

462
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,737
Say, Fred, where did you leave Al?

463
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:20,114
Oh, Al. He's home in the swankiest
apartment house in town.

464
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:22,492
We'll never see him again.

465
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:27,579
-Say, this is the best place we've been yet.
-Hey, that's Al.

466
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:32,125
Where you been?
We were just talking about you.

467
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,711
Oh, my aching back.

468
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:39,047
Hey, Milly. Peggy.
Step up and meet the gang.

469
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:41,049
This is Homer, this is Fred.

470
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:42,551
This is my wife and daughter.

471
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:46,971
Homer and I were together at the Battle
of Lingayen Gulf, only we didn't know it.

472
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,973
-Hi, bub.
-How do you do?

473
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,267
-Al, this is my Uncle Butch.
-Bu--

474
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:55,562
Oh, I hear you got a new neon sign, huh?
Good for you.

475
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:57,896
Now the party can really get started.

476
00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:59,481
Oh, this better.

477
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:02,317
Let's sit. Milly, come on.
Here's a good booth.

478
00:37:02,484 --> 00:37:03,610
Fred, come on, sit down.

479
00:37:03,777 --> 00:37:05,903
Hey, Fred, where's your wife?
I wanna meet her.

480
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,447
I haven't been able to find her.
She works in some nightclub.

481
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:10,324
I've been around places looking--

482
00:37:10,491 --> 00:37:12,993
Well, we'll find her, Fred,
before this night is out.

483
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,871
We'll deploy our forces
and comb the town. Won't we, Milly?

484
00:37:16,037 --> 00:37:17,663
Oh, by all means.

485
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,832
Well, we got the Navy to convoy us.

486
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:22,460
We gotta get one thing straight.
Homer lost his hands.

487
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:24,669
He's got those hooks.
They don't worry him...

488
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:27,005
...so they don't need to worry anybody.
Right?

489
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:29,591
-Right.
-Right, now let's get seriously to work.

490
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:32,676
-Telephone, Butch.
-Thank you. Give them anything they want.

491
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:34,511
Any kind of beer.

492
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:36,387
-What'll it be?
-How are you, Angus?

493
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,514
-Hi, sergeant. Hello.
-Nice to see you.

494
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:40,516
-Looking well. A little gray.
-Hi, Angus.

495
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:41,809
Yeah, yeah.

496
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:43,351
Well...

497
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:46,146
-...cheers, cheers.
-Cheers!

498
00:37:46,313 --> 00:37:47,731
Homer.

499
00:37:48,356 --> 00:37:50,357
Okay, Butch.

500
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:52,735
Aren't you drinking?

501
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:58,281
-Excuse me, folks.
-Sure, Homer.

502
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:08,706
Gee, Butch, it's swell
to hear you playing again.

503
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:11,918
How about ''Lazy River''?
Remember that?

504
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,546
Sit down, Homer.

505
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,805
Wilma phoned.

506
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,555
Wilma?

507
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,058
-What did she want?
-You.

508
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,269
Oh, why can't they leave a guy alone?

509
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,105
Because they're fond of you, that's why.

510
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,399
What made you leave the house
and get them all worried?

511
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:42,068
Oh, they....

512
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:45,404
-They got me nervous.
-How?

513
00:38:45,863 --> 00:38:48,115
Butch, it's nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.

514
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,575
How'd they get you nervous?

515
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:52,535
Well, they....

516
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:55,412
Well, they keep staring at these hooks...

517
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:58,791
...or else they keep staring
away from them.

518
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,001
You mean whatever they do is wrong.

519
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:07,548
Why don't they understand that all I want
is to be treated like everybody else?

520
00:39:07,798 --> 00:39:09,800
Take Pop for instance.

521
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:14,262
He was cleaning his pipe
like I've seen him do a million times.

522
00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:19,099
And all of a sudden he got conscious
that he had hands and I didn't and he....

523
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:22,894
He stopped cleaning his pipe
and he tried to hide his hands...

524
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,688
...like he was guilty or something.

525
00:39:30,276 --> 00:39:32,902
Give them time, kid. They'll catch on.

526
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:37,239
You know, your folks will get used to you
and you'll get used to them.

527
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:40,159
Then everything will settle down nicely.

528
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:42,619
Unless we have another war.

529
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:48,374
Then none of us have to worry, because
we'll all be blown to bits the first day.

530
00:39:54,504 --> 00:39:56,630
So cheer up, huh?

531
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,967
Hey, Butch.

532
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:04,429
You know "Among My Souvenirs," huh?

533
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,491
Shall we dance?

534
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:31,327
Well, that's a charming idea.

535
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:37,207
Do you remember this tune?

536
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:34,380
Nice to see the young folks
enjoying themselves, isn't it?

537
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:39,134
So you're Al's daughter.

538
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:43,263
Yes. I've been that
as long as I can remember.

539
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:47,266
You don't seem like Al's daughter.

540
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,893
Actually, I'm not.

541
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,062
He's my son by a previous marriage.

542
00:41:56,232 --> 00:41:58,400
-What did you say your name was?
-Peggy.

543
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:02,904
-Peggy, my name's Fred. How do you do?
-How do you do?

544
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:07,783
Oh, no, you don-- Oh, no.

545
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:45,648
You're a bewitching little creature.

546
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:48,942
In a way, you remind me of my wife.

547
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:52,321
-But you never told me you're married.
-Oh, yeah.

548
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:56,115
I've got a little woman and two kiddies
back there in the States.

549
00:42:56,282 --> 00:43:00,495
-But let's not think of them now.
-Oh, you're so right.

550
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,955
This night belongs only to us.

551
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:13,838
That's the type of thing people ought
to be thinking about these days.

552
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,925
All right, I promise I'll get right to work
on it.

553
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:20,219
And there's one thing
I've been wanting to ask you.

554
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,554
You ask it, Peggy.

555
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:25,307
You mustn't feel shy with me.

556
00:43:26,475 --> 00:43:28,976
Why don't you call your wife?

557
00:43:29,644 --> 00:43:31,104
I don't know her number.

558
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,314
-I couldn't find it in the phone book.
-Phone book!

559
00:43:34,481 --> 00:43:38,235
We don't need to do any telephoning.
We're all set.

560
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:40,653
What you need is a drink.

561
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,072
Good night, everybody. I'm going home.

562
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:45,491
-Why?
-I've gotta. Butch says I've gotta.

563
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:47,784
-He's gonna drive me.
-Oh, no, no.

564
00:43:47,951 --> 00:43:50,662
-But you can't. No, you can't....
-It's quite all right.

565
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,704
And don't any of you leave. I'll be back.

566
00:43:52,871 --> 00:43:54,498
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

567
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,918
Poor kid. Imagine, he's gotta go home.

568
00:43:58,085 --> 00:44:01,754
-Doesn't that put any ideas in your head?
-Yes.

569
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:05,632
I'd love to.

570
00:44:10,095 --> 00:44:12,179
Lights out, Steve.

571
00:44:17,143 --> 00:44:22,021
-Where do we go next, old pal, old pal?
-Just follow me, old pal.

572
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:28,527
Step.

573
00:44:29,278 --> 00:44:31,821
-Good night, Al.
-Good night, Butch. Been a nice party.

574
00:44:37,784 --> 00:44:39,661
This it, Fred?

575
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:42,205
It looks like it.

576
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:46,834
Silly.

577
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:50,211
Good night, Milly. Many thanks
for a most enjoyable evening.

578
00:44:50,378 --> 00:44:52,672
-Good night, Fred.
-Good night, Al.

579
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:54,883
Best of luck to you.

580
00:44:57,718 --> 00:44:59,219
I'll give him your message.

581
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:01,013
Hey, you do that.

582
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,306
And good night to you, Peggy.

583
00:45:03,473 --> 00:45:07,226
-It has indeed been a great pleasure.
-Yes, Fred. See you soon.

584
00:45:07,393 --> 00:45:09,227
By all means.

585
00:45:10,562 --> 00:45:12,355
I beg your pardon.

586
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,191
Good night.

587
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:20,029
We'd better wait and see if he gets in.

588
00:45:29,495 --> 00:45:33,082
I don't think he even knows
if this is the right place.

589
00:45:58,603 --> 00:45:59,603
Come on.

590
00:46:01,271 --> 00:46:02,815
Up.

591
00:46:08,277 --> 00:46:09,695
Where are we all going now?

592
00:46:09,862 --> 00:46:12,614
Don't ask. We want it to be a surprise.

593
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:38,386
They make a lovely couple, don't they?

594
00:46:39,387 --> 00:46:43,099
Yeah. I think they'll be
very happy together.

595
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,039
Who are you?

596
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:12,790
Don't you remember?

597
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:14,709
I'm Peggy.

598
00:47:15,877 --> 00:47:18,712
Yes. Peggy.

599
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:23,424
I'm not that Peggy.

600
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,677
That's too bad.

601
00:48:31,649 --> 00:48:36,903
As I remember, when you lie flat
on your back, you snore.

602
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:39,947
Here. Where's your hand?

603
00:48:42,991 --> 00:48:44,535
Here.

604
00:48:44,702 --> 00:48:46,953
Give me your hand.

605
00:49:13,642 --> 00:49:17,270
-Is Fred all right?
-Yes. He's all right.

606
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:20,440
-You'll be comfortable here.
-Sure, Mom. Night.

607
00:49:20,606 --> 00:49:22,442
Night, dear.

608
00:49:26,445 --> 00:49:27,446
Night.

609
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:29,406
Night.

610
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:00,932
Get out of there.

611
00:51:09,198 --> 00:51:11,659
Got a turnaround at 4 o'clock.

612
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,914
It's all over.

613
00:51:19,331 --> 00:51:21,000
You got him.

614
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,336
He's hit.

615
00:51:27,714 --> 00:51:29,215
She's on fire.

616
00:51:29,382 --> 00:51:31,216
She's on fire.

617
00:51:33,885 --> 00:51:35,679
The fire's spreading.

618
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:37,055
It's Gadorsky.

619
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:39,098
There goes number four.

620
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:40,516
She's breaking formation.

621
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:42,476
Watch out for fighters.

622
00:51:42,643 --> 00:51:43,768
It's spread to the wing.

623
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,687
The wing's on fire.

624
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:47,313
She's out of control.

625
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,815
She's out of control.

626
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,152
She's going down.

627
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,237
Hey, you guys, jump!

628
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,238
Get out of there. Bail out!

629
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,366
Gadorsky.
Gadorsky, get out of that plane!

630
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:02,577
Two chutes open.

631
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:04,578
Three.

632
00:52:05,162 --> 00:52:06,580
Come on, the rest of you guys.

633
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:07,914
-Fred.
-Come on, get out!

634
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:10,124
-Fred, wake up. Wake up.
-Gadorsky!

635
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:12,209
-Gadorsky! She's burning up!
-Wake up!

636
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:14,754
-Get out! Get out!
-Fred! Fred, wake up! Wake up!

637
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,922
She's burning up! She's gonna hit.
Look out!

638
00:52:18,757 --> 00:52:21,967
It's all right, Fred. Go back to sleep.

639
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,930
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep, Fred.

640
00:52:31,893 --> 00:52:34,354
There's nothing to be afraid of.

641
00:52:35,604 --> 00:52:37,689
All you have to do is...

642
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:41,484
...go to sleep and rest.

643
00:52:42,818 --> 00:52:44,904
Go to sleep.

644
00:52:45,821 --> 00:52:48,281
Go to sleep, Fred.

645
00:52:49,574 --> 00:52:51,451
Go to sleep...

646
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:53,620
...and rest.

647
00:52:56,622 --> 00:52:58,457
Go to sleep.

648
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:01,542
Go to sleep.

649
00:53:03,461 --> 00:53:06,713
All you have to do is rest.

650
00:53:09,132 --> 00:53:11,093
Go to sleep.

651
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:37,457
Oh, I'm terribly sorry I woke you up.

652
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,792
That's all right but....

653
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:42,836
I know. You're about to say,
"Where am I?"

654
00:54:43,003 --> 00:54:47,132
I'll tell you later, Fred.
You can sleep as long as you want.

655
00:55:51,144 --> 00:55:55,564
-Did he fly 17s or 24s?
-I don't know.

656
00:55:56,565 --> 00:56:00,235
-What group was he with?
-He didn't say.

657
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:03,279
Well, what did you two talk about?

658
00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:06,448
Rob, you'd better hurry up.
You'll be late for school.

659
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:08,784
Holy Moses.

660
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:12,704
I'll see you later. Bye.

661
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,966
Oh, excuse me, captain.
I'm Rob Stephenson, Peggy's brother.

662
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,844
She's in there in the kitchen.
She's fixing your breakfast.

663
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,470
I've gotta run. Goodbye.

664
00:56:41,312 --> 00:56:44,314
-Hello.
-Hello.

665
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:46,691
Sit down.

666
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:54,323
-Here, this may help.
-Thanks.

667
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:56,032
Sit down.

668
00:56:58,534 --> 00:57:00,828
You're Peggy, aren't you?

669
00:57:01,495 --> 00:57:05,332
For the last time, yes. Want some eggs?

670
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:09,418
-You think I can take them?
-Sure, they'll be good for you.

671
00:57:10,002 --> 00:57:12,755
-Like them scrambled?
-Any way you cook them.

672
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:14,298
Good.

673
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:18,384
Sleep all right?

674
00:57:20,845 --> 00:57:22,429
Wonderful.

675
00:57:23,055 --> 00:57:24,806
That's good.

676
00:57:30,144 --> 00:57:35,357
-Can I help you with any of that business?
-You can pour the coffee if you want some.

677
00:57:37,776 --> 00:57:40,527
Do you mind if I ask you
a somewhat personal question?

678
00:57:40,694 --> 00:57:42,029
No.

679
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:47,241
-Where did you sleep last night?
-On the couch.

680
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:51,663
-That's terrible.
-What's terrible?

681
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:54,039
I should've had enough sense
to go to a hotel...

682
00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:56,708
...and not come around here
bothering you.

683
00:57:57,542 --> 00:58:02,338
You didn't bother anybody, Fred.
We're very glad to have you here.

684
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,341
Besides, you couldn't have
gotten a room in a hotel.

685
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,178
Did I get out of line with you?

686
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:13,597
No. Not really.

687
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:19,394
-That's good. Because, you see, I'm married.
-Yes, I know.

688
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:24,899
I must have got pretty plastered
last night.

689
00:58:25,732 --> 00:58:27,985
You had nothing on my dad.

690
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:30,070
Your dad? Who's he?

691
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,573
Don't you remember Al?

692
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:41,121
Oh, Al. Yeah, good old Al. Where is he?

693
00:58:41,288 --> 00:58:43,415
Still asleep, I guess.

694
00:58:45,082 --> 00:58:47,251
So you're Al's daughter.

695
00:58:48,168 --> 00:58:51,296
You've got it all straight now.

696
00:58:52,338 --> 00:58:55,633
-I feel a lot better.
-That's good.

697
00:58:58,093 --> 00:59:01,096
-Are you married, Peggy?
-No.

698
00:59:01,263 --> 00:59:02,889
I guess you've hardly had time.

699
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:06,058
-You must have been engaged, though.
-No.

700
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:10,478
Why not? What's the matter
with the guys around here?

701
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:13,773
I guess the best of them
are already married.

702
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:23,281
-Good morning, Fred.
-Good morning, Mrs....

703
00:59:23,448 --> 00:59:26,618
-Milly's the name.
-Thanks, Milly.

704
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:29,077
When Al wakes up,
tell him how much I appreciate--

705
00:59:29,244 --> 00:59:32,456
You're not going.
You haven't even finished your breakfast.

706
00:59:32,623 --> 00:59:35,875
I'm afraid I haven't got
much of an appetite this morning.

707
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:37,710
Besides, I've gotta get downtown.

708
00:59:37,877 --> 00:59:40,963
Maybe now I can get into
that apartment house where my wife lives.

709
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,257
I'll drive you, Fred.
I've got to get to work at the hospital.

710
00:59:44,424 --> 00:59:45,884
Just be a minute.

711
00:59:46,051 --> 00:59:48,302
I must've acted
pretty disgracefully last night.

712
00:59:48,469 --> 00:59:49,678
No.

713
00:59:49,845 --> 00:59:54,099
You just fell in with bad company
at Butch's and got stinking.

714
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:58,561
You see, the whole trouble was
I couldn't find Marie, that's my wife.

715
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:03,023
-I didn't know she had a job in a nightclub.
-Could've happened to anyone.

716
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,526
If Al had come home a little later last night,
we wouldn't have been in.

717
01:00:06,693 --> 01:00:08,694
He wouldn't have known
where to look for us.

718
01:00:08,861 --> 01:00:10,863
-How is Al?
-We don't know yet.

719
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,657
Ready, Fred.

720
01:00:12,823 --> 01:00:16,534
When he wakes up, you can tell him for me,
I think he's a pretty lucky guy.

721
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:18,245
Thank you, Fred.

722
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:21,580
-Goodbye, Milly, Thanks for everything.
-Goodbye.

723
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,667
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, dear.

724
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:04,677
-What'd you do before the war, Fred?
-I was a fountain attendant.

725
01:03:04,843 --> 01:03:07,887
-A what?
-Soda jerk.

726
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:13,100
-Surprised?
-Yes, a little.

727
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:16,270
I bet you mixed up
a fine ice cream soda.

728
01:03:16,436 --> 01:03:19,730
You're darn right.
I was an expert behind that fountain.

729
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:22,149
I used to toss
a scoop of ice cream in the air...

730
01:03:22,316 --> 01:03:26,444
...adjust for wind drift, velocity, altitude,
and, wham, in the cone every time.

731
01:03:26,987 --> 01:03:30,240
I figure that's where
I really learned to drop bombs.

732
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:32,866
What do you think you'll do now?

733
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:36,537
I'm not going back to that drugstore.

734
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:41,916
Somehow or other, I can't figure myself
getting excited about a root beer float.

735
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:45,377
I don't know just what I will do...

736
01:03:45,544 --> 01:03:48,547
...but I'm gonna take
plenty of time looking around.

737
01:03:50,923 --> 01:03:55,678
I guess after all the places you've been,
Boone City looks pretty dreary to you.

738
01:03:56,928 --> 01:03:59,431
Not from where I'm sitting right now.

739
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:03,767
That's not just a line. I really meant it.

740
01:04:29,956 --> 01:04:33,126
-Who's that?
-It's me. Milly.

741
01:04:34,294 --> 01:04:37,713
-I brought your breakfast.
-Thanks.

742
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,799
-Didn't think you'd be up for hours.
-You know, I had a dream.

743
01:04:40,965 --> 01:04:43,051
I dreamt I was home.

744
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:46,971
I've had that same dream
hundreds of times before.

745
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:50,724
This time I wanted to find out
if it's really true.

746
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:54,352
-Am I really home?
-Looks like it.

747
01:04:54,518 --> 01:04:58,898
And you're going to be royally treated.
You're having breakfast in bed.

748
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:05,946
I seem to have a vague recollection
that we had a couple of children.

749
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:08,489
-Is that right?
-That's right.

750
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,241
What ever became of them?

751
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:13,993
Rob's gone to school
and Peggy's driving downtown with Fred.

752
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,578
Fred?

753
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:20,791
Oh, yeah, Fred. He's a great guy.

754
01:05:25,462 --> 01:05:26,921
All right?

755
01:05:32,425 --> 01:05:36,137
There's your breakfast.
I have work to do.

756
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,779
Well, it was nice knowing you, Peggy.

757
01:05:56,113 --> 01:06:01,033
-That sounds like a permanent goodbye.
-You never know.

758
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:04,452
You and your wife
must come up to dinner.

759
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,913
That'd be fine.

760
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,207
Oh, there's one thing more.

761
01:06:10,374 --> 01:06:13,294
About that dream I had last night.

762
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:17,046
I've had it before.
I'm sorry I had to bother you with it.

763
01:06:17,213 --> 01:06:21,259
But you were very kind and you didn't
even mention it this morning.

764
01:06:21,926 --> 01:06:24,636
As a matter of fact,
you've been swell about everything.

765
01:06:25,304 --> 01:06:27,723
I think they ought to put you
in mass production.

766
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,016
-Goodbye, Fred.
-Bye.

767
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:36,563
-Maybe I'd better wait and see if you get in.
-Maybe that's a good idea.

768
01:07:52,126 --> 01:07:53,753
Bye.

769
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:24,279
All right. All right.

770
01:08:24,821 --> 01:08:26,823
Say, what's the big i--?

771
01:08:27,532 --> 01:08:30,701
-Freddy!
-Hi, babe.

772
01:08:33,996 --> 01:08:36,582
Freddy, darling,
why didn't you let me know?

773
01:08:36,747 --> 01:08:39,000
You didn't give me a chance
to fix my face.

774
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:42,420
-You look all right, babe.
-Oh, Freddy, darling. I'm so excited.

775
01:08:42,587 --> 01:08:44,129
I can't believe it's you.

776
01:08:44,296 --> 01:08:48,008
Come on in, honey,
where I can look at you.

777
01:08:48,175 --> 01:08:52,052
Oh, you're marvelous. All those ribbons!

778
01:08:52,219 --> 01:08:56,181
You gotta tell me what they all mean.
But not now.

779
01:08:57,891 --> 01:09:01,186
Let me look at you.
But how did you know I was here?

780
01:09:01,352 --> 01:09:03,520
When I got in yesterday,
I went over to Pop's--

781
01:09:03,687 --> 01:09:06,732
-Yesterday? Why didn't--?
-I came here, but it was too late.

782
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:09,901
You'd already gone to work.
I went from one nightclub to another.

783
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:12,528
-You were looking for me?
-I was looking for my wife.

784
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:14,822
You've found her now.

785
01:09:39,885 --> 01:09:42,053
I wonder how Fred's getting along.

786
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,847
Fred looks to me as
if he's able to take care of himself.

787
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,599
I'm not so sure about that.

788
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:50,060
It isn't easy for those Air Force
glamour boys when they get grounded.

789
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:54,980
Now, when you've been in the infantry,
any change is bound to be an improvement.

790
01:09:55,856 --> 01:09:58,400
Please stop fussing around
and sit down and talk to me.

791
01:09:58,567 --> 01:10:01,236
All right, sergeant.
Gosh, you've got tough.

792
01:10:01,402 --> 01:10:03,530
-Is this all the cream there is?
-That's all.

793
01:10:03,696 --> 01:10:07,241
Fine situation when a man
can't get enough to eat in his own home.

794
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:08,826
Look at my pants.

795
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:10,494
-What about them?
-Too big.

796
01:10:10,661 --> 01:10:13,120
Gives you an idea
of what the war did to my waistline.

797
01:10:13,287 --> 01:10:15,915
-You holding your stomach in?
-No, it's disappeared.

798
01:10:16,082 --> 01:10:19,292
I'll have to take my clothes to
Wyndham and Briggs, get them altered.

799
01:10:19,459 --> 01:10:21,670
I wouldn't be in too much of a hurry
about that.

800
01:10:21,837 --> 01:10:25,339
A couple of weeks of heavy eating
and those pants will fit perfectly.

801
01:10:27,675 --> 01:10:29,593
Don't answer it.

802
01:10:35,723 --> 01:10:39,268
Hello. Oh, yes. He's here.

803
01:10:39,434 --> 01:10:42,104
For me?
If it's the War Department, I'm out.

804
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,605
It's Mr. Milton.

805
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,941
-Who?
-Mr. Milton. At the bank.

806
01:10:49,443 --> 01:10:51,444
He'll be right on.

807
01:10:54,072 --> 01:10:55,615
Hello?

808
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:58,826
Oh, yes, Mr. Milton.

809
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:03,454
Yeah, it sounds good to hear yours.

810
01:11:04,289 --> 01:11:05,915
Yes.

811
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,711
Yes, indeed, Mr. Milton. Yeah.

812
01:11:10,878 --> 01:11:13,463
Well, not too bad, no.

813
01:11:14,965 --> 01:11:19,635
Yes. Why, of course.
It's very kind of you to say that.

814
01:11:24,139 --> 01:11:25,599
Yes.

815
01:11:26,558 --> 01:11:29,727
Well, I'll certainly drop in.

816
01:11:31,562 --> 01:11:35,148
Oh, she's fine, thank you.

817
01:11:35,857 --> 01:11:39,652
-Yes, they're fine too.
-They're fine too.

818
01:11:41,778 --> 01:11:46,325
Well-- I-- That's--

819
01:11:47,367 --> 01:11:49,952
Thank you, Mr. Milton.

820
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:52,205
Yes, good.

821
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:53,915
Good--

822
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,167
Good-- Goodbye.

823
01:11:58,585 --> 01:11:59,836
Mr. Milton.

824
01:12:00,003 --> 01:12:02,296
He's called up every day
to see if you'd got home.

825
01:12:02,463 --> 01:12:05,007
I guess they want you back at the bank.

826
01:12:05,716 --> 01:12:07,675
He wants me to drop in and talk about it.

827
01:12:07,842 --> 01:12:09,844
You're not going to work right away.

828
01:12:10,011 --> 01:12:12,555
You ought to rest a while,
take a vacation.

829
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:14,681
I've got to make money.

830
01:12:14,848 --> 01:12:18,227
Last year it was kill Japs,
and this year it's make money.

831
01:12:18,393 --> 01:12:21,103
We're all right for the time being.

832
01:12:21,521 --> 01:12:24,190
Why do they bother me like that
the first day I get home?

833
01:12:24,357 --> 01:12:26,483
Why can't they give a fellow time
to get used to his own family?

834
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,610
Why don't you come over here
and sit down?

835
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:32,738
-Chair's liable to break.
-We can't be worrying about chairs.

836
01:12:32,905 --> 01:12:36,867
Not when they want me back
in a nice fat job at a nice fat bank.

837
01:12:37,034 --> 01:12:40,286
-You don't seem very happy about it.
-I'm not.

838
01:12:40,453 --> 01:12:44,958
-Why not, darling?
-I can't help thinking about the other guys.

839
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:48,710
All the ones who haven't got you.

840
01:12:49,294 --> 01:12:51,629
-You're crazy.
-No.

841
01:12:51,796 --> 01:12:54,048
Too sane for my own good.

842
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,821
-Yes, sir?
-Didn't this used to be Bullard's Drugstore?

843
01:13:20,988 --> 01:13:24,448
Yes, but it was taken over last year
by the Midway chain.

844
01:13:24,615 --> 01:13:27,702
But old Mr. Bullard's still here,
in charge of prescription.

845
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:30,579
-He's right over there by the phone.
-Thanks.

846
01:13:57,393 --> 01:13:58,936
Yes, sir?

847
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:02,147
-Oh, Fred Derry.
-Hello, Mr. Bullard.

848
01:14:02,314 --> 01:14:05,942
-Oh, it's good to see you again.
-How are you? It's good to see you.

849
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,611
-Say, what happened here?
-Well, I sold out.

850
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,655
The Midway people had been
after this location for a long time.

851
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:15,074
-Didn't he used to work here?
-Yes, he did.

852
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:17,202
I'll bet he's back looking for a job.

853
01:14:17,368 --> 01:14:21,789
And he'll get it too,
with all those ribbons on his chest.

854
01:14:21,955 --> 01:14:26,168
Well, nobody's job is safe
with all these servicemen crowding in.

855
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:31,130
I'd like to have you meet
our new manager, Mr. Thorpe.

856
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:34,299
Oh, no, I don't think so.
I just dropped in to say hello to you.

857
01:14:34,466 --> 01:14:37,677
-I don't want that old job back.
-Yes, I know.

858
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:40,471
But Midway's a big, big outfit.

859
01:14:40,638 --> 01:14:43,682
You never can tell. Come along.

860
01:14:45,684 --> 01:14:48,645
-Thank you, Mr. Bullard.
-I'll see you later.

861
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:51,356
I can see that you had
a splendid war record, Derry.

862
01:14:51,523 --> 01:14:52,773
Just average, Mr. Thorpe.

863
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:55,651
You'll understand
that since this business changed hands...

864
01:14:55,818 --> 01:14:58,487
...we're under no obligation
to give you your old job back.

865
01:14:58,654 --> 01:15:02,073
I wasn't thinking of my old job.
I'm looking for a better one.

866
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,368
What are your qualifications?
Your experience?

867
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,160
Two years behind a soda fountain...

868
01:15:07,327 --> 01:15:09,412
...and three years
behind a Norden bombsight.

869
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:10,622
Yeah.

870
01:15:10,789 --> 01:15:13,707
While in the Army, did you have
any experience in procurement?

871
01:15:13,874 --> 01:15:16,127
-No.
-Purchasing of supplies, materials?

872
01:15:16,293 --> 01:15:18,378
I didn't do any of that.
I just dropped bombs.

873
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:20,338
-Did you do any personnel work?
-No.

874
01:15:20,505 --> 01:15:24,300
But, as an officer, you surely
had to act in an executive capacity...

875
01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:27,386
...you had to command men,
be responsible for their morale?

876
01:15:27,553 --> 01:15:30,848
No, I was only responsible
for getting the bombs on the target.

877
01:15:31,013 --> 01:15:32,306
I didn't command anybody.

878
01:15:32,473 --> 01:15:35,351
I see.
I'm sure that work required great skill.

879
01:15:35,518 --> 01:15:38,728
But, unfortunately,
we've no opportunities...

880
01:15:38,895 --> 01:15:41,148
-...for that with Midway Drugs.
-Yeah.

881
01:15:41,314 --> 01:15:43,983
However, we might be able to
provide an opening for you...

882
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:46,527
...as an assistant to Mr. Merkel,
the floor manager.

883
01:15:46,694 --> 01:15:48,779
-Sticky Merkel?
-Clarence Merkel.

884
01:15:48,946 --> 01:15:52,282
Yeah, that's the fella. He used to be
my assistant at the soda fountain.

885
01:15:52,449 --> 01:15:54,659
He's a very good man.

886
01:15:54,826 --> 01:15:59,204
Incidentally, your work would require
part-time duties at the soda fountain.

887
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:02,541
-At what salary?
-Thirty-two fifty per week.

888
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:03,833
Thirty-two fifty.

889
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,502
I used to make over $400 a month
in the Air Force.

890
01:16:06,669 --> 01:16:08,463
-The war is over, Derry.
-Is over.

891
01:16:08,629 --> 01:16:10,922
Yeah, well, I think I'll look around,
Mr. Thorpe.

892
01:16:11,089 --> 01:16:14,509
Thank you, very much.
Take care of that cold.

893
01:16:18,596 --> 01:16:20,723
-I gotta run. I'll drop back later.
-All right.

894
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,432
-Bye.
-Bye.

895
01:16:22,599 --> 01:16:24,517
Excuse me, girls.

896
01:17:10,098 --> 01:17:13,433
No, conditions are none too good
right now, Al.

897
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:19,438
Considerable uncertainty in the business
picture. Strikes, taxes still ruinous.

898
01:17:20,022 --> 01:17:23,275
-You like that cigar?
-Oh, yes, Mr. Milton. It's fine.

899
01:17:23,442 --> 01:17:27,112
Hard to get those during the war, but
they're coming in regularly from Havana.

900
01:17:27,278 --> 01:17:30,782
All things will readjust themselves
in time.

901
01:17:31,241 --> 01:17:33,826
We want you back here with us, Al.

902
01:17:33,992 --> 01:17:37,121
Well, that's very nice of you,
Mr. Milton...

903
01:17:37,287 --> 01:17:41,124
...but I noticed Steese
sitting at my old desk.

904
01:17:41,582 --> 01:17:45,335
-I wouldn't wanna push him out.
-Steese will stay right there.

905
01:17:45,502 --> 01:17:47,212
You're moving up.

906
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,966
What would you say to being
vice president in charge of small loans...

907
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:57,179
...at a salary of $12,000 a year?
What would you say to that, huh?

908
01:17:58,972 --> 01:18:03,810
-I'd say it can't be true.
-Job's there, Al. You're the man for it.

909
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,645
What makes you think I am, Mr. Milton?

910
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:10,356
Well, your war experience
would prove invaluable to us here.

911
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:14,652
See, we have many new problems.
This GI Bill of Rights, for instance.

912
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:19,406
It involves us in consideration
of all kinds of loans to ex-servicemen.

913
01:18:19,573 --> 01:18:23,033
We need a man who understands
the soldiers' problems...

914
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,619
...and at the same time
who's well-grounded...

915
01:18:25,786 --> 01:18:28,998
...in the fundamental principles
of sound banking.

916
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:31,666
In other words, you.

917
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:35,503
Well? What do you say, Al?

918
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:40,924
-I'm overwhelmed.
-Of course. Of course.

919
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,509
Will you bring them in now,
Mrs. Garrett?

920
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:44,719
Yes, sir.

921
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:47,805
-I'd thought of taking it easy for a while.
-Naturally, my boy.

922
01:18:47,972 --> 01:18:50,348
After what you've been through,
you need a vacation.

923
01:18:50,515 --> 01:18:51,850
Thank you. Thank you.

924
01:18:52,017 --> 01:18:55,352
You're entitled to enjoy life for a change
before you come back to work.

925
01:18:55,519 --> 01:18:57,354
Very kind of you to say that,
Mr. Milton.

926
01:18:57,521 --> 01:19:00,232
While you're resting, let's just....
When you get a chance.

927
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:03,276
This contains reports with all the figures
on our small loans.

928
01:19:03,443 --> 01:19:06,071
It'll give you the whole picture.
You can look them over.

929
01:19:06,237 --> 01:19:08,238
Just in your spare time, of course.

930
01:19:08,405 --> 01:19:14,035
-Oh, briefcase is a slight gift from the bank.
-Well, thank you.

931
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:17,038
-Thank you very much, Mr. Milton.
-Glad to have you back, Al.

932
01:19:17,205 --> 01:19:18,998
Thank you, sir.

933
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:24,961
Well, of course, sweetheart.
I knew you'd be heartbroken.

934
01:19:25,128 --> 01:19:29,548
But listen, you can get another blond.
What about Sylvia Mack?

935
01:19:33,426 --> 01:19:37,097
Oh, you're crazy.
I think her legs are cute.

936
01:19:38,389 --> 01:19:41,475
Well, I'm sorry too,
but he doesn't want me to work nights.

937
01:19:41,642 --> 01:19:44,561
He says it's inconvenient.

938
01:19:46,729 --> 01:19:48,856
Oh, he's wonderful. And how.

939
01:19:49,023 --> 01:19:52,401
Snappy uniform,
a whole ribbon counter on his chest.

940
01:19:52,567 --> 01:19:54,903
Sure, I'll bring him in sometime.

941
01:19:55,946 --> 01:19:58,073
The doorbell's ringing.
I guess that's Freddy.

942
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,908
Yeah, yeah. Bye.

943
01:20:04,745 --> 01:20:08,039
Hey, Marie, have you got an extra key?
I'd like to have it.

944
01:20:08,665 --> 01:20:11,417
-What are you looking at?
-Holy smoke, honey.

945
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:14,420
That's the first time
I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.

946
01:20:14,586 --> 01:20:19,090
Well, from now on, honey,
you're not gonna see me in anything else.

947
01:20:19,257 --> 01:20:22,760
I just got it out of the mothballs
over at Pop's house.

948
01:20:25,637 --> 01:20:27,848
I called up the Blue Devil.

949
01:20:28,014 --> 01:20:30,016
-Who?
-That's the night club where I worked.

950
01:20:30,183 --> 01:20:31,851
-I told them I'm through.
-Oh, swell.

951
01:20:32,017 --> 01:20:35,604
But let's go there for dinner, Freddy.
I'd like to introduce you to the gang.

952
01:20:35,771 --> 01:20:38,523
-They've heard me talk so much about you.
-Anything you say.

953
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:42,277
Here's some perfume
and some other junk I bought in Paris.

954
01:20:42,444 --> 01:20:46,530
Fleurette No. 5. And this scarf's cute.

955
01:20:46,697 --> 01:20:48,782
To think of having things from Paris.

956
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:51,242
Freddy, honey,
you're just a big hunk of heaven.

957
01:20:51,409 --> 01:20:55,246
-What's that a picture of?
-Bomb hits on Düsseldorf.

958
01:20:56,663 --> 01:20:58,790
Well, that's my B-17.

959
01:20:58,957 --> 01:21:00,792
What are those?

960
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:04,795
Little black flowers that grow in the sky.

961
01:21:05,838 --> 01:21:07,214
Hey, that's me!

962
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:10,633
Yeah, I had this picture pasted
on the plexiglass over my bombsight.

963
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,595
-It took a lot of trips over Germany, baby.
-That's sweet.

964
01:21:13,762 --> 01:21:15,304
The guys used to kid me about it.

965
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:18,640
They'd take a look at the picture and ask,
"Who's the dame?"

966
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,976
And when I told them
it was my wife they'd say:

967
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:23,144
"Go on, nobody's got a wife
looks like that.

968
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,313
What's her telephone number?"

969
01:21:26,814 --> 01:21:29,149
When we go out tonight,
will you wear your uniform?

970
01:21:29,316 --> 01:21:30,859
-Oh, no.
-For my sake.

971
01:21:31,026 --> 01:21:34,071
-I'm sorry, baby.
-I'd be so proud to be out with you.

972
01:21:34,236 --> 01:21:36,197
Won't you, please?

973
01:21:37,698 --> 01:21:39,742
Well, seeing as it's you.

974
01:21:39,909 --> 01:21:42,827
Seeing as I can't find any place
to hang it up, all right.

975
01:21:42,994 --> 01:21:44,662
But it's the last time.

976
01:21:44,829 --> 01:21:47,414
From now on,
if you don't like me in civilian clothes...

977
01:21:47,915 --> 01:21:52,002
-...we'll just have to stay here all the time.
-Would that be so bad?

978
01:21:55,338 --> 01:21:59,133
Seriously, honey, you gotta get yourself
some new clothes. That suit's awful.

979
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,760
I know, it's terrible.

980
01:22:01,927 --> 01:22:04,888
But they tell me
you can't buy anything new now.

981
01:22:05,055 --> 01:22:08,015
I know a place where you can get
snappy suits made to order.

982
01:22:08,182 --> 01:22:09,809
You mean there's a black market?

983
01:22:09,975 --> 01:22:12,644
You can get a lot of things,
if you know the right people.

984
01:22:12,811 --> 01:22:15,021
And if you don't care
how much you spend.

985
01:22:15,522 --> 01:22:19,733
We're not worrying about that, baby.
I got money. Cash money.

986
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:23,779
Nearly a thousand bucks
right from the good old U.S. Treasury.

987
01:22:23,946 --> 01:22:26,739
Oh, now you look wonderful.

988
01:22:26,906 --> 01:22:28,783
You look like yourself.

989
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:31,702
You know, honey, it's so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.

990
01:22:31,868 --> 01:22:35,455
Now we can have a real honeymoon
without a care in the world.

991
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:39,959
Just as if nothing had ever happened.
Just as if you'd never gone away.

992
01:22:40,126 --> 01:22:44,171
-We're right back where we started.
-Don't say that, Marie.

993
01:22:44,337 --> 01:22:46,965
-Don't say what?
-That we're right back where we started.

994
01:22:47,132 --> 01:22:50,176
We can never be back there again.
We never wanna be back there.

995
01:22:50,343 --> 01:22:53,011
But why not? What is it?
What's the matter with you, Fred?

996
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:54,263
Oh, never mind. Skip it.

997
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:56,640
I was back to the drugstore
where I used work...

998
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:58,891
...and I just got suddenly reminded.

999
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:03,271
Come on, let's go out and have fun.

1000
01:23:32,253 --> 01:23:34,630
-Hello, Wilma.
-Good afternoon, Mr. Parrish.

1001
01:23:34,797 --> 01:23:38,508
-Have you seen Homer?
-He's out in the woodshed.

1002
01:23:38,675 --> 01:23:43,471
Says he wants to get in some practice
shooting. So he can go hunting.

1003
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,558
Thought that he'd seen enough shooting
in the war.

1004
01:23:47,725 --> 01:23:50,769
Well, I guess he just wants
to find something to occupy himself.

1005
01:23:50,935 --> 01:23:52,604
I guess so.

1006
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:55,606
I wish there was something
I knew to do for him.

1007
01:23:55,773 --> 01:23:59,109
His mother and I have tried
to make him feel at home.

1008
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:03,988
But he just keeps to himself
all the time.

1009
01:24:28,759 --> 01:24:31,470
Hello, Luella.
What are you kids doing?

1010
01:24:31,637 --> 01:24:34,639
Oh, nothing, we're just playing.

1011
01:24:38,476 --> 01:24:41,561
That's his girl. They're engaged.

1012
01:24:47,274 --> 01:24:50,194
-Oh, hello, Wilma.
-Hello.

1013
01:24:50,528 --> 01:24:52,779
-Looking for something?
-No.

1014
01:24:52,946 --> 01:24:54,739
Go right ahead.

1015
01:25:23,805 --> 01:25:27,684
-How'd you do, Homer?
-Only fair.

1016
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:29,853
Well, you did fine.

1017
01:25:30,602 --> 01:25:32,354
I'll do better.

1018
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:45,198
I've been wanting to have
a chance to talk to you.

1019
01:25:45,365 --> 01:25:48,952
-What about?
-About everything.

1020
01:25:49,368 --> 01:25:51,078
About us.

1021
01:25:51,245 --> 01:25:52,997
What about us?

1022
01:25:53,164 --> 01:25:56,833
-We're all right, aren't we?
-No.

1023
01:25:57,417 --> 01:26:00,587
-Listen to me, Homer.
-I'm listening.

1024
01:26:02,087 --> 01:26:06,300
You wrote me that when you got home
you and I were going to be married.

1025
01:26:06,467 --> 01:26:10,386
If you wrote that once, you wrote it
a hundred times. Isn't that true?

1026
01:26:10,887 --> 01:26:14,390
Yes, but things are different now.

1027
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:17,684
Have you changed your mind?

1028
01:26:17,851 --> 01:26:20,853
Have I said anything about
changing my mind?

1029
01:26:21,145 --> 01:26:24,774
No. That's just it.

1030
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:27,984
You haven't said anything
about anything.

1031
01:26:32,906 --> 01:26:35,574
-That's not loaded, is it?
-Of course, it isn't loaded.

1032
01:26:35,741 --> 01:26:38,160
Don't you think I know
how to handle a gun?

1033
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:40,370
I don't know what to think, Homer.

1034
01:26:40,536 --> 01:26:43,373
All I know is, I was in love with you
when you left...

1035
01:26:43,539 --> 01:26:45,917
...and I'm in love with you now.

1036
01:26:46,084 --> 01:26:50,796
Other things may have changed,
but that hasn't.

1037
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:02,722
You wanna see how the hooks work?

1038
01:27:02,889 --> 01:27:04,933
You wanna see the freak?

1039
01:27:07,601 --> 01:27:08,852
All right, I'll show you.

1040
01:27:10,646 --> 01:27:12,480
Take a good look.

1041
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:16,275
I didn't mean anything, Homer.

1042
01:27:17,694 --> 01:27:18,985
I was only....

1043
01:27:23,073 --> 01:27:25,574
I'm sorry, Luella.

1044
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:28,035
It isn't your fault.

1045
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:29,870
Go on and play with your friends.

1046
01:27:44,173 --> 01:27:46,676
I know, Wilma. I was wrong.

1047
01:27:46,843 --> 01:27:49,095
I shouldn't have acted like that.

1048
01:27:49,262 --> 01:27:52,848
It wasn't her that burned my hands off.

1049
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:56,809
I'll be all right.

1050
01:27:56,976 --> 01:27:58,769
I just gotta work it out myself.

1051
01:27:58,936 --> 01:28:03,440
-I could help you, Homer, if you'd let me.
-I've gotta work it out myself.

1052
01:28:04,274 --> 01:28:10,195
All I've wanted is for people to treat me
like anybody else instead of pitying me.

1053
01:28:11,238 --> 01:28:14,158
I guess it's hard for them to do that.

1054
01:28:14,325 --> 01:28:18,828
I've just gotta learn to get used to it
and pay no attention.

1055
01:28:19,996 --> 01:28:23,582
-Couldn't I--?
-No, I've gotta do it myself.

1056
01:29:41,898 --> 01:29:44,734
-Yes?
-Okay, Pop, I'm going to bed now.

1057
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,152
Be right with you, Homer.

1058
01:31:05,302 --> 01:31:06,511
Good night, son.

1059
01:31:06,678 --> 01:31:09,221
Good night, Pop. Thanks.

1060
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,367
Hello, babe.

1061
01:31:32,533 --> 01:31:34,159
-What you got there?
-Our supper.

1062
01:31:34,326 --> 01:31:37,245
Cream of corn soup, potato salad, salami
and liverwurst.

1063
01:31:37,412 --> 01:31:40,498
We're going to Jackie's Hot Spot.
I phoned and made a reservation.

1064
01:31:40,665 --> 01:31:42,416
We're eating at home.

1065
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:44,794
What's the matter, honey?
You sick or something?

1066
01:31:44,961 --> 01:31:46,836
No, dear. Broke.

1067
01:31:48,254 --> 01:31:50,256
-Broke?
-You got it.

1068
01:31:50,423 --> 01:31:53,133
But what happened? Where did it go to?

1069
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,678
We spent it, babe.
That's what happened.

1070
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,554
I'm sorry it's so sudden.

1071
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,847
I didn't tell you the money
was almost gone...

1072
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,725
...because every day I kept hoping
I was gonna land a job.

1073
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:06,228
At last I got it through my thick skull
that I'm not going to get one...

1074
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:08,855
...so we'll have to forget about
Jackie's Hot Spot...

1075
01:32:09,022 --> 01:32:11,274
...and the Blue Devil and all the rest.

1076
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:12,817
Why couldn't you get a job?

1077
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:14,360
-You really been trying?
-Sure.

1078
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:18,238
I've been all over town.
All the employment offices and the USES.

1079
01:32:18,405 --> 01:32:20,240
They all tell me I don't know anything.

1080
01:32:20,407 --> 01:32:24,410
They say I ought to spend a couple of years
as an apprentice or go to a trade school.

1081
01:32:25,327 --> 01:32:28,122
A couple of years
with you going to kindergarten.

1082
01:32:28,289 --> 01:32:30,623
And what would I be doing
in the meantime?

1083
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:33,543
Well, you could always help me
with my homework.

1084
01:32:37,921 --> 01:32:39,965
-Fred.
-Yep?

1085
01:32:40,215 --> 01:32:41,550
Are you really all right?

1086
01:32:41,717 --> 01:32:43,718
Of course, I'm all right. Why?

1087
01:32:43,884 --> 01:32:48,222
-I mean, in your mind. Is there anything--?
-My mind?

1088
01:32:48,389 --> 01:32:51,224
You mean you think I'm going goofy?

1089
01:32:52,892 --> 01:32:57,062
I've been wondering.
What was Gadosky?

1090
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,398
Where did you hear about him?

1091
01:32:59,565 --> 01:33:01,066
You talk in your sleep, honey.

1092
01:33:01,233 --> 01:33:03,443
Sometimes you shout.
Something's on fire...

1093
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:07,238
...and you want somebody to get out.
You keep saying, "Gadosky, Gadosky."

1094
01:33:07,405 --> 01:33:09,114
Gadorsky.

1095
01:33:09,489 --> 01:33:12,534
Oh, he was a friend of mine, a B-17 pilot.
He got it over Berlin.

1096
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:14,786
Can't you get those things
out of your system?

1097
01:33:14,953 --> 01:33:17,246
-Oh, sure.
-Maybe that's what's holding you back.

1098
01:33:17,413 --> 01:33:20,750
The war's over. You won't get any place
till you stop thinking about it.

1099
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:22,083
Come on, snap out of it.

1100
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:24,544
Okay, honey, I'll do that.

1101
01:33:26,838 --> 01:33:30,674
I didn't tell you, Fred,
but I got a little money saved.

1102
01:33:30,841 --> 01:33:33,052
Dinner's on me tonight.

1103
01:33:34,094 --> 01:33:37,597
You'd better keep on saving it, babe.
It might come in handy sometime.

1104
01:33:37,764 --> 01:33:40,224
I appreciate the offer,
but we're eating at home.

1105
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:43,268
Well, I'm hungry.
I'm going out by myself.

1106
01:33:43,435 --> 01:33:45,604
You're not going out.
You're gonna stay here...

1107
01:33:45,771 --> 01:33:48,105
-...and eat what I cook and like it.
-Let go of me.

1108
01:33:48,272 --> 01:33:49,941
When we were married, the justice
of the peace said something about...

1109
01:33:50,107 --> 01:33:52,818
...for richer, for poorer,
for better, for worse. Remember?

1110
01:33:52,985 --> 01:33:55,570
-This is the worse.
-When do we get going on the better?

1111
01:33:55,737 --> 01:33:57,572
Whenever I get wise to myself, I guess.

1112
01:33:57,739 --> 01:34:01,158
Whenever I wake up and realize
I'm not an officer and a gentleman anymore.

1113
01:34:01,325 --> 01:34:03,369
I'm just another soda jerk out of a job.

1114
01:34:03,535 --> 01:34:05,621
Now, go on and sit down
and read a magazine...

1115
01:34:05,788 --> 01:34:08,331
...or listen to the radio
while I cook the soup.

1116
01:34:11,668 --> 01:34:14,002
I'll fix you a nice meal, honey.

1117
01:34:14,169 --> 01:34:18,090
Just like I used to do behind the fountain,
before the war.

1118
01:34:33,519 --> 01:34:36,063
The Perfume and Cosmetics Department
is now our outstanding feature.

1119
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:38,481
It accounts for 34 percent
of our gross intake...

1120
01:34:38,648 --> 01:34:40,650
...and a higher proportion of our profits.

1121
01:34:40,817 --> 01:34:44,653
As you will surmise, our customers in this
department are almost exclusively women.

1122
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,655
Yes, I'd surmised that.

1123
01:34:46,822 --> 01:34:49,658
Familiarize yourself
with the pronunciation of the perfumes.

1124
01:34:49,825 --> 01:34:51,951
For instance, here's a popular number.

1125
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:54,453
-Rêve Romantique.
-Yeah, that means romantic dream.

1126
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,872
-You speak French?
-Well, I'll tell you, Sticky...

1127
01:34:57,038 --> 01:34:59,457
...just enough to make
my way around the Paris bars.

1128
01:34:59,624 --> 01:35:03,586
Let's get one thing straight, Derry.
The name Sticky is out.

1129
01:35:03,752 --> 01:35:06,505
-Yes, Mr. Merkel. I understand.
-This week, we're pushing...

1130
01:35:06,672 --> 01:35:08,757
...the new champagne
bubble bath preparation.

1131
01:35:08,924 --> 01:35:13,845
A dollar ninety-eight for the large jar. Down
here are some special made-- Come here.

1132
01:35:14,012 --> 01:35:16,346
Down here are some
specially made-up toilet sets.

1133
01:35:16,513 --> 01:35:18,265
They don't represent a very great....

1134
01:35:18,432 --> 01:35:21,018
-Good morning, Mr. Brook.
-Good morning.

1135
01:35:21,768 --> 01:35:23,227
-Thank you.
-Good morning.

1136
01:35:23,394 --> 01:35:24,854
I have an appointment with you.

1137
01:35:25,021 --> 01:35:26,606
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1138
01:35:26,772 --> 01:35:28,649
Good morning, Mrs. Garrett.

1139
01:35:30,025 --> 01:35:33,028
What have we here?
The Bretton Woods agreement?

1140
01:35:33,361 --> 01:35:35,362
That's a Mr. Novak waiting over there.

1141
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,282
I've filled out the basic form.
He's applying for a GI loan.

1142
01:35:38,449 --> 01:35:41,285
-Oh, good. I'll see him.
-Mr. Novak.

1143
01:35:41,659 --> 01:35:44,829
-Sit down, Mr. Novak.
-Thank you, sir.

1144
01:35:45,622 --> 01:35:48,206
Don't sir me, Mr. Novak.

1145
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:50,667
I'm a sergeant.

1146
01:35:54,712 --> 01:35:56,714
-I see you were in the Navy.
-Yes, sir.

1147
01:35:56,881 --> 01:36:00,051
I mean, yes, I was in the Seabees.

1148
01:36:00,217 --> 01:36:02,052
Where'd you operate?

1149
01:36:02,302 --> 01:36:05,055
All over the Pacific.
One little after island after another.

1150
01:36:05,221 --> 01:36:07,348
What'd you do, mostly?

1151
01:36:07,556 --> 01:36:09,099
We went in before the landings...

1152
01:36:09,266 --> 01:36:11,894
...and cleared the mines
and underwater obstructions.

1153
01:36:12,061 --> 01:36:15,188
When they'd taken enough ground
for an airstrip, we'd build it.

1154
01:36:15,355 --> 01:36:17,148
Fairly interesting work, eh?

1155
01:36:17,315 --> 01:36:20,943
No, it got monotonous.
Those islands all look alike.

1156
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,654
Until Iwo Jima. That was different.

1157
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:25,530
So I've heard.

1158
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:29,784
I see you have quite a family.
A wife and four children.

1159
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:33,954
Yes, there'd have been more
if I hadn't been away three years.

1160
01:36:34,496 --> 01:36:37,582
-And now you wanna buy a farm.
-Yes, sir.

1161
01:36:37,749 --> 01:36:40,084
Got my eye on a fine piece of property.

1162
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:42,711
Forty acres, out near Anton Corners.

1163
01:36:42,878 --> 01:36:44,630
What about collateral?

1164
01:36:46,547 --> 01:36:47,924
Collateral? What's that?

1165
01:36:48,091 --> 01:36:50,093
Security for your loan.

1166
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,594
What can you put up
in the way of property?

1167
01:36:52,761 --> 01:36:57,349
Have you any stocks and bonds,
real estate, valuables of any kind?

1168
01:36:57,516 --> 01:37:01,978
Well, no, Mr. Stephenson, you see,
the point is, I haven't got any property.

1169
01:37:02,144 --> 01:37:05,647
That's why I want the loan,
so I can get the property.

1170
01:37:05,814 --> 01:37:07,524
I see.

1171
01:37:08,316 --> 01:37:11,193
No collateral.
That makes things difficult.

1172
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,529
I'm a good farmer, Mr. Stephenson.

1173
01:37:13,696 --> 01:37:16,115
Why, even during the war
I kept my hand in.

1174
01:37:16,282 --> 01:37:19,075
I used to spend my spare time
down on those little islands...

1175
01:37:19,242 --> 01:37:22,453
...working truck gardens
so my outfit could have fresh tomatoes...

1176
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:24,496
...and green corn and all that.

1177
01:37:24,663 --> 01:37:29,459
And before the war, I was a sharecropper,
like my father before me.

1178
01:37:29,626 --> 01:37:34,297
And now, I feel I'd like to have
a little piece of my own to work.

1179
01:37:34,463 --> 01:37:37,465
-You like to grow things, eh?
-Yes, sir.

1180
01:37:37,632 --> 01:37:39,634
With the food shortage
all over the world...

1181
01:37:39,801 --> 01:37:43,387
...it's seems to me that farming's about
the most important work there is.

1182
01:37:43,554 --> 01:37:44,805
I mean....

1183
01:37:44,972 --> 01:37:47,892
Well, don't you think so,
Mr. Stephenson?

1184
01:37:49,267 --> 01:37:50,727
Yes.

1185
01:37:52,604 --> 01:37:54,022
You see, Mr. Stephenson...

1186
01:37:54,188 --> 01:37:57,649
...I don't feel this is asking
the bank for a handout.

1187
01:37:57,816 --> 01:37:59,610
I feel it's my right.

1188
01:37:59,776 --> 01:38:02,904
At least, that's what I've been told
by other ex-servicemen...

1189
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:05,990
...that the government guarantees
loans to us, if we wanna buy--

1190
01:38:06,157 --> 01:38:09,326
Your loan would be administered
through this bank...

1191
01:38:09,492 --> 01:38:13,413
...which would put up half of the $6000
you require.

1192
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:16,999
Now, that involves risk for this bank,
Mr. Novak.

1193
01:38:23,046 --> 01:38:24,881
Excuse me.

1194
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,558
-Al.
-Homer.

1195
01:38:37,725 --> 01:38:40,268
-Look at you.
-Look at you.

1196
01:38:40,685 --> 01:38:42,354
-So this is where you work.
-Sort of.

1197
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,606
What are you doing here?
Sticking up the bank?

1198
01:38:44,773 --> 01:38:46,607
Look at it, Al, 200 leaves of cabbage.

1199
01:38:46,774 --> 01:38:49,693
That's what I get every month
from Old Mr. Whiskers from now on.

1200
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,695
-Pretty soft, eh?
-Pretty soft.

1201
01:38:51,862 --> 01:38:54,280
-You sure we haven't shortchanged you?
-Oh, no.

1202
01:38:54,447 --> 01:38:57,075
I kept my eye on that guy
when he counted it out.

1203
01:38:57,242 --> 01:39:00,327
Say, Al, did you know Fred Derry
had a job at the Midway drugstore?

1204
01:39:00,494 --> 01:39:01,870
No, I didn't.

1205
01:39:02,037 --> 01:39:04,665
-He introduced me to his wife.
-Yeah?

1206
01:39:04,831 --> 01:39:06,082
-Some dish.
-Yeah.

1207
01:39:06,249 --> 01:39:08,417
We'll all have to get together at Butch's.

1208
01:39:08,584 --> 01:39:10,586
Fine. Oh, that's where I'm going now.

1209
01:39:10,753 --> 01:39:13,171
-Yeah?
-Take a piano lesson.

1210
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:16,758
Take one for me.

1211
01:39:17,092 --> 01:39:19,552
-See you later. Bye.
-So long, Homer.

1212
01:39:27,725 --> 01:39:30,228
Well, as I was saying, Mr. Novak...

1213
01:39:30,395 --> 01:39:32,980
...there is an element of risk involved.

1214
01:39:33,146 --> 01:39:37,942
We'll have to have the property appraised,
but you'll get your loan.

1215
01:39:38,943 --> 01:39:41,028
Say, Mr. Stephenson...

1216
01:39:41,195 --> 01:39:43,780
-...I don't know how to begin to thank you.
-Don't try.

1217
01:39:43,947 --> 01:39:45,574
You look like a good risk to me.

1218
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:49,077
And when those tomato plants
start producing, I'll come for free samples.

1219
01:39:49,244 --> 01:39:51,245
I'll let you know
when the papers are ready.

1220
01:39:51,412 --> 01:39:54,331
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1221
01:39:55,082 --> 01:39:56,916
God bless you.

1222
01:40:04,381 --> 01:40:06,258
Oh, I've seen advertisements
about this one.

1223
01:40:06,425 --> 01:40:09,177
Night of Bliss. Is it all that they say it is?

1224
01:40:09,343 --> 01:40:11,053
Well, just what do they say it is?

1225
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,308
Haunting, provocative, languorous.
Oh, yes, I'm sure it's all of those.

1226
01:40:20,103 --> 01:40:21,771
Dexter.

1227
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,943
Don't play with those toys, bud.

1228
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:29,152
My name ain't Bud.

1229
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:32,697
-Dexter, you stop that. Do you hear?
-I just wanted to see how it worked.

1230
01:40:32,864 --> 01:40:35,949
-Sorry. You heard what Mommy said.
-It's all right.

1231
01:40:36,408 --> 01:40:38,368
Seduction. How much is that?

1232
01:40:38,535 --> 01:40:40,162
This is....

1233
01:40:40,329 --> 01:40:43,831
It's quite expensive.
It's 16.50, but it's a nice size.

1234
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:53,590
You see what I mean?

1235
01:40:53,757 --> 01:40:55,633
But it's a good, safe bet.

1236
01:40:55,799 --> 01:40:57,384
Just what do you mean by that?

1237
01:40:57,551 --> 01:40:58,636
Well, I mean it's....

1238
01:40:58,802 --> 01:41:01,763
Well, it's a perfume that fits any mood.

1239
01:41:02,972 --> 01:41:04,557
All right, I'll take it.

1240
01:41:04,724 --> 01:41:06,642
Very good, madam.

1241
01:41:07,059 --> 01:41:09,978
Mommy, Mommy, look!

1242
01:41:10,145 --> 01:41:13,564
I shot it down! I shot down a plane!

1243
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,447
I'm very sor--

1244
01:41:22,614 --> 01:41:25,200
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

1245
01:41:26,659 --> 01:41:27,952
Thank you very much.

1246
01:41:28,118 --> 01:41:30,287
I'll be with you in just a moment, madam.

1247
01:41:30,829 --> 01:41:32,622
Will you take this, please?

1248
01:41:32,789 --> 01:41:35,583
This lady will have your package
and your change in a moment.

1249
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:37,502
Thank you very much and come in again.

1250
01:41:37,669 --> 01:41:39,169
Thank you.

1251
01:41:41,296 --> 01:41:44,091
-You were wonderful.
-I wanted to smack him.

1252
01:41:44,258 --> 01:41:47,677
It's against the rules here
to chat with customers unless it's a sale.

1253
01:41:47,843 --> 01:41:49,387
All right, I'll buy something.

1254
01:41:49,554 --> 01:41:50,930
What's this?

1255
01:41:51,097 --> 01:41:53,557
Youth Recaptured,
that's a complexion cream.

1256
01:41:53,723 --> 01:41:56,142
But you don't need
any of that phony stuff.

1257
01:41:56,810 --> 01:42:00,062
Well, that's vanishing cream.
This is a vanishing cream remover.

1258
01:42:00,229 --> 01:42:01,939
I'll tell you how you can save money.

1259
01:42:02,106 --> 01:42:05,733
If you don't put that on,
then you don't need this to take that off.

1260
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:08,444
How about some lotion?

1261
01:42:08,611 --> 01:42:14,074
Here's one at $2.98,
and you'd be over charged at half the price.

1262
01:42:14,992 --> 01:42:16,909
I didn't really come in to buy anything.

1263
01:42:17,076 --> 01:42:20,538
Dad told me you were working here
and I just dropped in to say hello.

1264
01:42:20,705 --> 01:42:22,248
Oh, just a minute.

1265
01:42:22,415 --> 01:42:24,040
I have....

1266
01:42:24,875 --> 01:42:28,962
I have an hour off at 1:00.
Are you doing anything for lunch?

1267
01:42:29,587 --> 01:42:31,088
Why, no.

1268
01:42:31,255 --> 01:42:34,049
Thank you, madam.
I'll meet you outside in 20 minutes.

1269
01:42:34,216 --> 01:42:37,427
-Come in again.
-Thank you.

1270
01:42:52,982 --> 01:42:54,650
The apple pie, she's homemade.

1271
01:42:55,442 --> 01:42:57,360
-Good.
-Thank you.

1272
01:42:58,987 --> 01:43:01,072
It is a nice little place.

1273
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:02,823
I never heard of it before.

1274
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:06,952
I used to come here now and then
in the old days, before the war.

1275
01:43:07,328 --> 01:43:10,163
Sometimes I used to think of this place
when I was overseas.

1276
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:15,334
I thought, "When I get back home
I'm never gonna eat in a dump like Lucia's."

1277
01:43:15,918 --> 01:43:18,837
What else did you think you wouldn't do
when you were overseas?

1278
01:43:19,004 --> 01:43:22,173
I never had any clear ideas,
but there were two things I was sure of.

1279
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:26,010
One, that I knew
I'd never go back to that drugstore.

1280
01:43:26,177 --> 01:43:30,180
-What was the other thing?
-That was even sillier.

1281
01:43:30,847 --> 01:43:33,307
I dreamed I was gonna have
my own home.

1282
01:43:33,474 --> 01:43:37,144
Just a nice little house for my wife
and me out in the country...

1283
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:39,521
...in the suburbs, anyway.

1284
01:43:39,687 --> 01:43:43,107
That's the cockeyed kind of dream
you have when you're overseas.

1285
01:43:43,274 --> 01:43:46,902
You don't have to be overseas
to have dreams like that.

1286
01:43:47,069 --> 01:43:48,153
Yeah.

1287
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,323
You can get crazy ideas
right here at home.

1288
01:43:55,451 --> 01:43:57,703
Didn't you say
you had to be back at work at 2?

1289
01:43:57,870 --> 01:43:59,246
Yeah.

1290
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:02,040
Well, hadn't you better...?

1291
01:44:02,707 --> 01:44:04,668
Yeah. Check, please.

1292
01:44:04,835 --> 01:44:08,379
Eighty-five cents apiece for lunch,
plus tax, that's a $1.76.

1293
01:44:08,546 --> 01:44:10,089
Okay.

1294
01:44:10,923 --> 01:44:12,048
Thank you very much.

1295
01:44:12,215 --> 01:44:14,217
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

1296
01:44:14,926 --> 01:44:16,553
Goodbye, signorina. Come again.

1297
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:18,554
We'll do that. So long, Giuseppe.

1298
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,389
Arrivederci, sir.

1299
01:44:29,772 --> 01:44:31,273
Well....

1300
01:44:47,787 --> 01:44:49,621
That shouldn't have happened.

1301
01:44:50,747 --> 01:44:52,749
But I guess it had to.

1302
01:45:00,673 --> 01:45:03,884
-Goodbye, Peggy.
-Goodbye.

1303
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:20,523
We were discussing
this loan to this man....

1304
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:21,982
What's his name?

1305
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,775
Novak.

1306
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:26,695
Yes, yes, I approved it.

1307
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:29,655
Well, may I ask, Al, on what basis?

1308
01:45:29,822 --> 01:45:31,741
On the basis of my own judgment.

1309
01:45:31,908 --> 01:45:35,952
-Novak looked to me like a good bet.
-But the man has no collateral, no security.

1310
01:45:36,119 --> 01:45:39,915
-Evidently, you saw something in this man.
-Yes, Mr. Milton.

1311
01:45:40,081 --> 01:45:42,374
-What was it?
-Security.

1312
01:45:42,541 --> 01:45:44,043
Collateral.

1313
01:45:45,127 --> 01:45:47,378
Mr. Milton, in the Army
I've had to be with men...

1314
01:45:47,545 --> 01:45:49,506
...when they were stripped
of everything...

1315
01:45:49,672 --> 01:45:53,550
...in the way of property except what they
carried around with them and inside them.

1316
01:45:53,717 --> 01:45:56,929
I saw them being tested. Some of them
stood up to it and some didn't.

1317
01:45:57,095 --> 01:45:59,847
But you got so you could tell
which ones you could count on.

1318
01:46:00,014 --> 01:46:02,808
I tell you, this man Novak is okay.

1319
01:46:02,975 --> 01:46:07,646
His collateral is in his hands,
in his heart, in his guts.

1320
01:46:07,813 --> 01:46:10,649
-In his right as a citizen.
-Nobody's denying him his rights.

1321
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:13,692
Yes, we are. If we deny him
his chance to work in his own way.

1322
01:46:13,859 --> 01:46:16,070
Gentlemen,
there's no need to raise our voices.

1323
01:46:16,237 --> 01:46:20,740
Of course, since you've approved the loan,
the incident is closed.

1324
01:46:21,157 --> 01:46:25,536
-However, in the future, Al--
-Yes, I understand, Mr. Milton.

1325
01:46:25,702 --> 01:46:28,831
In the future,
I must exercise more caution.

1326
01:46:29,206 --> 01:46:31,291
Thank you, Mr. Prew.

1327
01:46:33,292 --> 01:46:34,836
Al.

1328
01:46:37,921 --> 01:46:41,341
Al, you know how I feel about you
and always have.

1329
01:46:41,508 --> 01:46:46,178
Why, I've always considered you
one of the family, so to speak.

1330
01:46:46,345 --> 01:46:49,890
Like my own s-- Younger brother.

1331
01:46:50,182 --> 01:46:54,018
I picked you personally for this job,
and I know you'll make good.

1332
01:46:54,185 --> 01:46:57,104
And we do. We have every desire...

1333
01:46:57,271 --> 01:47:00,858
...to extend a helping hand
to returning veterans...

1334
01:47:01,024 --> 01:47:02,359
...whenever possible.

1335
01:47:02,526 --> 01:47:06,863
But we must all remember
that this is not our money we're doling out.

1336
01:47:07,029 --> 01:47:09,490
It belongs to our depositors...

1337
01:47:09,657 --> 01:47:11,575
...and we can't gamble with it.

1338
01:47:11,741 --> 01:47:14,077
I'll remember, Mr. Milton.

1339
01:47:14,244 --> 01:47:16,495
We'll meet at the Union Club at 7:30.

1340
01:47:16,662 --> 01:47:21,375
-And give my best to your charming wife.
-Thank you, Mr. Milton.

1341
01:47:47,272 --> 01:47:48,397
Hello.

1342
01:47:48,564 --> 01:47:50,149
Oh, hello.

1343
01:47:50,316 --> 01:47:52,985
Say, better hurry and get dressed.
And wear your new suit.

1344
01:47:53,152 --> 01:47:55,445
We're going out to dinner
at the Embassy Club.

1345
01:47:55,612 --> 01:47:58,406
Oh, don't worry, it won't cost a nickel.
We got invited.

1346
01:47:58,573 --> 01:48:01,283
-Who invited us?
-Ms. Peggy Stephenson.

1347
01:48:01,450 --> 01:48:04,912
She called up a little while ago and
said her father was a friend of yours.

1348
01:48:05,078 --> 01:48:08,372
She sounded like a nice kid. She's going
with some boyfriend of hers...

1349
01:48:08,539 --> 01:48:10,917
...and asked us to come on a double date,
as guests.

1350
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:14,044
-You told her we could go?
-You bet I did.

1351
01:48:14,211 --> 01:48:16,213
Well, call her up and tell her we can't go.

1352
01:48:16,379 --> 01:48:19,591
Tell her I made another engagement.
Tell her anything.

1353
01:48:22,718 --> 01:48:25,012
Say, who is this Peggy Stephenson?

1354
01:48:25,179 --> 01:48:27,847
-She's a girl.
-I didn't think she was a kangaroo.

1355
01:48:28,014 --> 01:48:29,098
Where did you meet her?

1356
01:48:29,265 --> 01:48:31,684
I told you the night I got back
and you weren't here.

1357
01:48:31,851 --> 01:48:33,685
Al Stephenson
and his wife took me home.

1358
01:48:33,852 --> 01:48:36,063
She's their daughter.
I'd never seen her before.

1359
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:37,773
Or since?

1360
01:48:38,065 --> 01:48:41,275
If you think you're gonna make anything
out of this, you're due for a disappointment.

1361
01:48:41,442 --> 01:48:43,903
I just don't like accepting handouts
when we're broke.

1362
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:45,737
Well, you'd better get used to it.

1363
01:48:45,904 --> 01:48:50,116
Because I don't see how we're gonna get
much fun on your 32.50 a week.

1364
01:49:05,963 --> 01:49:07,923
Hold still.

1365
01:49:09,299 --> 01:49:11,801
You'll probably have to make a speech.

1366
01:49:11,968 --> 01:49:15,847
It's my plan to meet that situation
by getting well plastered.

1367
01:49:17,806 --> 01:49:19,891
Peggy's going out dancing
with Woody Merrill.

1368
01:49:20,058 --> 01:49:22,519
-Who's he?
-You know, Bill Merrill's son.

1369
01:49:22,686 --> 01:49:26,564
Oh, yeah. Fine people, the Merrills.
Strictly TCR.

1370
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:29,650
-What's that?
-Top credit rating.

1371
01:49:29,817 --> 01:49:32,735
-Are his intentions honorable?
-I doubt it.

1372
01:49:32,902 --> 01:49:36,156
But they're going to be properly
chaperoned by Fred Derry and his wife.

1373
01:49:36,322 --> 01:49:39,741
Fred Derry? Some chaperone.

1374
01:49:39,992 --> 01:49:42,661
-I think she's crazy about him.
-Who, Merrill?

1375
01:49:42,827 --> 01:49:44,829
No, Fred.

1376
01:49:45,329 --> 01:49:48,458
Have you got any evidence
to support that amazing statement?

1377
01:49:48,624 --> 01:49:50,333
Just a hunch.

1378
01:49:53,462 --> 01:49:56,547
But my hunches are pretty good.

1379
01:50:07,348 --> 01:50:08,724
-Cocktails.
-Oh, no, you don't.

1380
01:50:08,891 --> 01:50:11,560
I made this for Woody Merrill,
he's coming to pick me up.

1381
01:50:11,727 --> 01:50:15,480
Surely you wouldn't deny your poor old
father a drop on a cold night like this.

1382
01:50:15,646 --> 01:50:16,898
I would if I could.

1383
01:50:17,064 --> 01:50:21,067
-I hear you're gonna see Fred.
-Yes.

1384
01:50:21,234 --> 01:50:23,153
What's his wife like?

1385
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,697
I don't know. I'll tell you later.

1386
01:50:25,864 --> 01:50:28,532
They'll have cocktails at the Union Club.

1387
01:50:28,699 --> 01:50:32,578
I know the kind Mrs. Milton serves.
Pink, sweet and nauseating.

1388
01:50:32,745 --> 01:50:35,705
I was just asking Peggy
about Fred's wife.

1389
01:50:36,164 --> 01:50:39,375
Never mind, Mom.
I know what you're both thinking.

1390
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:41,710
What are we thinking?

1391
01:50:43,086 --> 01:50:45,047
You're afraid I may be in love with Fred.

1392
01:50:46,089 --> 01:50:49,717
-Why, I never had any such id--
-Shut up, Al.

1393
01:50:49,884 --> 01:50:51,260
Are you in love with him?

1394
01:50:53,762 --> 01:50:55,180
Yes.

1395
01:50:55,806 --> 01:50:57,974
But I don't want to be.

1396
01:50:58,141 --> 01:51:01,936
That's why I asked him
and his wife to go out with us this evening.

1397
01:51:02,728 --> 01:51:06,397
I think it ought to have
a very healthy effect on me.

1398
01:51:07,023 --> 01:51:09,692
Once I get to know her, I....

1399
01:51:10,235 --> 01:51:14,196
Well, I'm sure I'll stop being silly
about the whole thing.

1400
01:51:18,699 --> 01:51:22,286
We don't need to worry about that child.
She can take care of herself.

1401
01:51:22,453 --> 01:51:24,622
That's what she thinks.

1402
01:51:26,248 --> 01:51:27,791
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1403
01:51:27,958 --> 01:51:29,751
-You know my father.
-Mr. Stephenson.

1404
01:51:29,918 --> 01:51:31,418
Nice to see you again.

1405
01:51:31,585 --> 01:51:32,878
-Have a drink?
-Thank you.

1406
01:51:33,045 --> 01:51:35,381
I've played a lot of golf with your father.

1407
01:51:35,548 --> 01:51:37,549
I know.
Been to the club since you got back?

1408
01:51:37,715 --> 01:51:39,843
-Haven't had a chance.
-Come on, we'll be late.

1409
01:51:40,009 --> 01:51:41,052
-Right.
-Good night.

1410
01:51:41,219 --> 01:51:43,763
-Night.
-Well, have a good time, children.

1411
01:51:43,929 --> 01:51:45,097
Thank you.

1412
01:51:45,264 --> 01:51:47,349
Give my best to Fred.

1413
01:51:49,977 --> 01:51:52,186
Al, come on.

1414
01:51:53,187 --> 01:51:55,773
Yes, Mr. Milton.

1415
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:06,740
-Hello, Peggy.
-Oh, Woody, don't be a bore.

1416
01:52:07,908 --> 01:52:09,784
Come on, we'll be late.

1417
01:52:10,076 --> 01:52:13,163
Our country must stand today
where it has always stood...

1418
01:52:13,329 --> 01:52:16,748
...the citadel of individual initiative...

1419
01:52:16,915 --> 01:52:21,170
...the land of unlimited opportunity
for all.

1420
01:52:25,757 --> 01:52:29,426
It is peculiarly appropriate
that we meet here tonight...

1421
01:52:29,593 --> 01:52:32,512
...to honor one
who has valiantly fought for that freedom.

1422
01:52:33,472 --> 01:52:35,806
Ladies and gentlemen,
we greet our friend...

1423
01:52:35,973 --> 01:52:40,770
...our coworker, our hero,
Al Stephenson.

1424
01:52:40,936 --> 01:52:43,104
Come on, on your feet, Al. On your feet.

1425
01:52:50,778 --> 01:52:54,655
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm very happy to be here.

1426
01:52:54,822 --> 01:52:57,283
In fact, I'm very happy to be anywhere.

1427
01:52:57,450 --> 01:52:59,952
In fact, I'm very happy.

1428
01:53:02,037 --> 01:53:06,249
Perhaps it'd be a good idea, if you just put
that bottle right down here in front of me.

1429
01:53:06,416 --> 01:53:10,795
-Here, save yourself quite a number of trips.
-Good old Al.

1430
01:53:15,924 --> 01:53:19,885
And I'm glad to see
you've all pulled through so well.

1431
01:53:20,052 --> 01:53:26,557
As Mr. Milton so perfectly expressed it,
our country stands today...

1432
01:53:26,724 --> 01:53:29,811
...where it stands today.
Wherever that is.

1433
01:53:29,977 --> 01:53:31,813
And I'm sure you'd all agree with me...

1434
01:53:31,979 --> 01:53:35,482
...if I said that now's the time for all of us
to stop all this nonsense...

1435
01:53:35,649 --> 01:53:40,820
...face facts, get down to brass tacks,
forget about the war, and go fishing.

1436
01:53:40,986 --> 01:53:43,239
But I'm not gonna say it.

1437
01:53:43,405 --> 01:53:47,784
I'm just going to sum the whole thing up
in one word.

1438
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:55,165
My wife doesn't think
I'd better sum it up in that one word.

1439
01:53:56,166 --> 01:53:59,085
I wanna tell you that the reason
for my success as a sergeant...

1440
01:53:59,252 --> 01:54:04,047
...is due primarily to my previous training
in the Corn Belt Loan and Trust Company.

1441
01:54:05,048 --> 01:54:07,509
The knowledge I acquired
in the good old bank...

1442
01:54:07,676 --> 01:54:10,845
...I applied to my problems
in the infantry.

1443
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:13,681
For instance, in Okinawa,
a major comes to me...

1444
01:54:13,848 --> 01:54:16,891
...he says, "Stephenson, you see that hill?"
"Yes, sir. I see it."

1445
01:54:17,058 --> 01:54:18,184
"All right," he said.

1446
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:21,729
"You and your platoon
will attack said hill and take it."

1447
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:26,984
So I said to the major, "But that
operation involves considerable risk.

1448
01:54:27,151 --> 01:54:29,527
We haven't sufficient collateral."

1449
01:54:29,694 --> 01:54:33,656
"I'm aware of that," said the major, "but
the fact remains, that there is the hill...

1450
01:54:33,823 --> 01:54:36,074
...and you are the guys
who are going to take it."

1451
01:54:36,241 --> 01:54:41,371
So I said to him, "I'm sorry, major.
No collateral, no hill."

1452
01:54:41,913 --> 01:54:47,209
So we didn't take the hill,
and we lost the war.

1453
01:54:50,128 --> 01:54:54,549
I think that little story
has considerable significance.

1454
01:54:54,716 --> 01:54:58,010
But I've forgotten what it is.

1455
01:55:01,721 --> 01:55:05,558
And now, in conclusion, I'd like to tell you
a humorous anecdote.

1456
01:55:05,725 --> 01:55:08,226
I know several humorous anecdotes...

1457
01:55:08,393 --> 01:55:11,271
...but I can't think of any way
to clean them up.

1458
01:55:12,105 --> 01:55:14,565
So I'll only say this much.

1459
01:55:14,732 --> 01:55:18,527
I love the Corn Belt Loan
and Trust Company.

1460
01:55:18,694 --> 01:55:23,406
There are some who say that the old bank
is suffering from hardening of the arteries...

1461
01:55:23,573 --> 01:55:24,908
...and of the heart.

1462
01:55:25,075 --> 01:55:28,577
I refuse to listen to such radical talk.

1463
01:55:28,744 --> 01:55:32,414
I say that our bank is alive,
it's generous, it's....

1464
01:55:32,581 --> 01:55:33,623
It's human!

1465
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:36,876
And we're going to have
such a line of customers...

1466
01:55:37,043 --> 01:55:40,045
...seeking and getting small loans...

1467
01:55:40,212 --> 01:55:43,590
...that people will think we're gambling
with the depositors' money.

1468
01:55:43,757 --> 01:55:45,925
And we will be.

1469
01:55:46,634 --> 01:55:50,179
We'll be gambling on the future
of this country.

1470
01:55:52,139 --> 01:55:53,681
I thank you.

1471
01:56:15,117 --> 01:56:17,619
Oh, Woody, I can't take it anymore.
Let's sit down.

1472
01:56:17,785 --> 01:56:19,954
We can't get out. I'm trapped.

1473
01:56:20,121 --> 01:56:21,831
How do you do?

1474
01:56:22,706 --> 01:56:24,666
Beg your pardon.

1475
01:56:24,833 --> 01:56:27,460
Well, anyway, we can't fall down.

1476
01:56:30,296 --> 01:56:34,174
-Is that table satisfactory?
-Everything. Everything's lovely.

1477
01:56:36,802 --> 01:56:40,680
Thank you very much.
Would you care to order now?

1478
01:56:41,472 --> 01:56:43,141
Sorry.

1479
01:56:53,232 --> 01:56:55,776
-Oh, I can't understand it.
-What?

1480
01:56:55,943 --> 01:56:59,696
Why you're not mad about me.
I think I'm attractive.

1481
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:04,616
-You are, Woody. You're irresistible.
-Then why do you go on resisting me?

1482
01:57:04,783 --> 01:57:07,578
You know, all marriages
don't have to be like that one.

1483
01:57:07,745 --> 01:57:11,372
-Which one?
-Your friends, Fred and Marie.

1484
01:57:11,539 --> 01:57:13,332
What's wrong with their marriage?

1485
01:57:13,499 --> 01:57:16,251
Oh, there's nothing wrong,
except for one slight detail.

1486
01:57:16,418 --> 01:57:17,878
They just don't like each other.

1487
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:25,676
Oh, it's murder on the dance floor.
Oh, it's awful.

1488
01:57:25,843 --> 01:57:27,678
You mean
you don't wanna dance anymore?

1489
01:57:27,845 --> 01:57:30,597
I'd love to! You don't you mind
if I borrow him for a while?

1490
01:57:30,764 --> 01:57:32,348
No, not at all.

1491
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,605
Why did you do this, Peggy?

1492
01:57:40,772 --> 01:57:44,984
-Do what? What do you mean?
-Calling up Marie and going out like this.

1493
01:57:45,151 --> 01:57:46,569
Together.

1494
01:57:46,736 --> 01:57:50,530
-I did it deliberately.
-Why?

1495
01:57:51,531 --> 01:57:57,119
To prove to myself that what happened
this afternoon didn't really happen.

1496
01:58:02,207 --> 01:58:04,042
But it did happen.

1497
01:58:04,209 --> 01:58:06,168
It had to happen.

1498
01:58:06,627 --> 01:58:10,381
And if we go on seeing each other, Peggy,
it'll happen again.

1499
01:58:26,394 --> 01:58:28,229
Excuse us.

1500
01:58:31,315 --> 01:58:34,651
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1501
01:58:37,696 --> 01:58:40,572
Oh, we wanna have
a picture taken over there in a few minutes.

1502
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:42,282
Fine, I'll be there.

1503
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:44,243
Excuse me.

1504
01:58:47,578 --> 01:58:49,122
Hello, Marie.

1505
01:58:49,288 --> 01:58:51,164
Good evening.

1506
01:58:53,792 --> 01:58:56,169
You gotta watch yourself in this town.
More wolves.

1507
01:58:56,336 --> 01:58:58,254
-I know.
-I pay no attention to the sign.

1508
01:58:59,630 --> 01:59:00,673
Go right in.

1509
01:59:05,552 --> 01:59:08,930
Gee, Woody's a cute boy. He's a lot of fun.
He's got a lot of dough too.

1510
01:59:09,097 --> 01:59:11,098
His family owns half the city, practically.

1511
01:59:11,265 --> 01:59:13,267
Certainly has a terrific yen
for you, Peggy.

1512
01:59:13,434 --> 01:59:15,644
I don't wanna butt
into your personal affairs...

1513
01:59:15,811 --> 01:59:18,980
...but if you'll take my advice, dear,
you'll grab Woody, but quick.

1514
01:59:19,147 --> 01:59:22,066
Woody and I are good friends,
but there's no romance there.

1515
01:59:22,233 --> 01:59:24,985
Never mind the romantic part.
That takes care of itself.

1516
01:59:25,152 --> 01:59:27,571
And I'm speaking from experience.

1517
01:59:27,738 --> 01:59:32,825
They'll tell you money isn't everything.
Well, maybe it isn't, but, boy, how it helps.

1518
01:59:32,992 --> 01:59:36,494
Do you know that while Fred was away,
I was drawing over $500 a month?

1519
01:59:36,661 --> 01:59:39,122
I mean, from his Army pay
and the job I had.

1520
01:59:39,289 --> 01:59:41,541
Now the two of us gotta live on
what Fred gets...

1521
01:59:41,707 --> 01:59:45,711
...from being a drugstore cowboy.
Thirty-two fifty a week.

1522
01:59:46,670 --> 01:59:50,339
Poor Fred. I guess you think
he's an awful sourpuss.

1523
01:59:50,506 --> 01:59:52,300
He didn't used to be that way, though.

1524
01:59:52,467 --> 01:59:56,803
Army's had an awful effect on him.
Knocked all the life out of him.

1525
01:59:57,304 --> 02:00:00,806
Fred isn't going to be satisfied
with that job at the drugstore.

1526
02:00:00,973 --> 02:00:03,142
-He'll get something better.
-Oh, sure.

1527
02:00:03,309 --> 02:00:06,645
Maybe in five years he'll be drawing down
40 or 50 bucks.

1528
02:00:06,812 --> 02:00:10,398
You can't have happy marriages
on that kind of dough.

1529
02:00:13,984 --> 02:00:15,361
You know, Peggy, you're cute.

1530
02:00:15,527 --> 02:00:18,822
But if you don't mind a personal
suggestion, you could use more makeup.

1531
02:00:18,989 --> 02:00:21,324
And I think you could get yourself
a better hairdo.

1532
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:25,536
I'll give you the name of my hairdresser.
Oh, but you've got nothing to worry about.

1533
02:00:25,703 --> 02:00:30,832
You'll get Woody
and live happily ever after. It's in the bag.

1534
02:00:34,418 --> 02:00:36,128
Thank you.

1535
02:00:41,675 --> 02:00:44,594
Now, everybody get in close together,
we're all palsy-walsy...

1536
02:00:44,761 --> 02:00:49,098
...put our arms around each other.
Come on, Fred. I don't mind.

1537
02:00:51,141 --> 02:00:54,560
Wait a minute, I'll tell you when.
Everybody, happy. Let's all be talking.

1538
02:00:54,727 --> 02:00:57,689
What a marvelous party.
We'll have to do this again, right away.

1539
02:00:57,855 --> 02:01:00,607
Okay, shoot the picture!

1540
02:01:01,608 --> 02:01:03,985
We want four copies, honey.

1541
02:01:06,696 --> 02:01:09,907
Mr. Milton certainly acted enthusiastic
about your speech.

1542
02:01:10,074 --> 02:01:13,076
Yeah, sure, that's how he acted,
the old hypocrite.

1543
02:01:13,243 --> 02:01:15,328
Suppose he'll fire you in the morning?

1544
02:01:15,495 --> 02:01:18,080
No, he'll never do anything as impetuous
as that.

1545
02:01:18,247 --> 02:01:20,207
He'll back me up wholeheartedly...

1546
02:01:20,374 --> 02:01:22,918
...till the next time I give a loan
to some little guy.

1547
02:01:23,085 --> 02:01:25,211
Then I'll have to fight it out
all over again.

1548
02:01:25,545 --> 02:01:28,089
-Yes?
-It's me, Peggy.

1549
02:01:28,256 --> 02:01:30,799
Oh, come in, darling.

1550
02:01:39,223 --> 02:01:42,309
-Did you have a good time?
-Not very.

1551
02:01:42,476 --> 02:01:45,145
What's all this? Children's hour?

1552
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,564
I beg your pardon.

1553
02:01:48,648 --> 02:01:51,567
Well, what's she like?

1554
02:01:53,694 --> 02:01:56,237
I'm glad I went out with them.

1555
02:01:56,863 --> 02:01:59,741
Even though
it was a pretty disagreeable experience.

1556
02:01:59,907 --> 02:02:02,993
It took guts, honey,
which you got plenty.

1557
02:02:03,577 --> 02:02:05,245
I'll need them.

1558
02:02:05,412 --> 02:02:08,123
-I've made up my mind.
-Good girl.

1559
02:02:08,289 --> 02:02:10,082
To do what?

1560
02:02:13,252 --> 02:02:15,670
I'm going to break that marriage up.

1561
02:02:16,921 --> 02:02:20,091
I can't stand it seeing Fred tied to a woman
he doesn't love.

1562
02:02:20,675 --> 02:02:22,718
And who doesn't love him.

1563
02:02:22,885 --> 02:02:27,889
Oh, it's horrible for him.
It's humiliating and it's killing his spirit.

1564
02:02:28,056 --> 02:02:29,974
Somebody's got to help him.

1565
02:02:30,141 --> 02:02:34,186
-Are you sure he doesn't love her?
-Of course I am.

1566
02:02:34,353 --> 02:02:36,396
Did he tell you?

1567
02:02:38,023 --> 02:02:40,483
-Did she?
-No.

1568
02:02:40,649 --> 02:02:42,610
So you just jumped to conclusions.

1569
02:02:43,277 --> 02:02:47,447
He doesn't love her, he hates her.
I know it, I know it.

1570
02:02:47,614 --> 02:02:49,824
Who are you? God?

1571
02:02:49,991 --> 02:02:52,993
How did you get this power to interfere
in other people's lives?

1572
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:55,537
Is Fred in love with you?

1573
02:02:56,705 --> 02:02:58,248
Yes.

1574
02:02:58,415 --> 02:03:03,252
-You've been seeing him?
-Only once. Today.

1575
02:03:03,419 --> 02:03:05,962
Oh, it was all perfectly respectable.

1576
02:03:06,129 --> 02:03:09,466
But when we were saying goodbye...

1577
02:03:09,633 --> 02:03:13,469
...he took me in his arms
and kissed me...

1578
02:03:13,636 --> 02:03:15,429
...and I knew.

1579
02:03:15,596 --> 02:03:18,515
And you think a kiss
from a smooth operator like Fred...

1580
02:03:18,682 --> 02:03:21,059
...you think that means anything?

1581
02:03:21,226 --> 02:03:22,977
You don't know him.

1582
02:03:23,144 --> 02:03:26,230
You don't know anything about
what's inside him.

1583
02:03:26,397 --> 02:03:29,316
Neither does she. His wife.

1584
02:03:29,483 --> 02:03:32,151
That's probably what she thought
when she married him.

1585
02:03:32,318 --> 02:03:35,446
A smooth operator
with money in his pockets.

1586
02:03:35,613 --> 02:03:38,991
But now he isn't smooth any longer,
and she's lost interest in him.

1587
02:03:39,157 --> 02:03:42,494
Whereas you're possessed
of all the wisdom of the ages.

1588
02:03:42,661 --> 02:03:46,038
You can see into the secret recesses
of his innermost soul.

1589
02:03:46,205 --> 02:03:49,166
I can see because I love him.

1590
02:03:49,917 --> 02:03:51,751
So you're gonna break this marriage up.

1591
02:03:51,918 --> 02:03:55,547
Have you decided yet how you're gonna
do it? You gonna do it with an ax?

1592
02:03:55,714 --> 02:03:58,632
It's none of your business
how I'm going to do it.

1593
02:03:58,799 --> 02:04:02,302
You've forgotten what it's like
to be in love!

1594
02:04:03,302 --> 02:04:04,971
You hear that, Milly?

1595
02:04:05,138 --> 02:04:10,517
I'm so old and decrepit, I've forgotten
how it feels to want somebody desperately.

1596
02:04:11,226 --> 02:04:14,354
Peggy didn't mean that.
Did you, darling?

1597
02:04:16,856 --> 02:04:17,898
No.

1598
02:04:19,692 --> 02:04:22,277
I don't know what I do mean.

1599
02:04:22,444 --> 02:04:27,115
It's just that everything
has always been so perfect for you.

1600
02:04:27,282 --> 02:04:30,034
You loved each other
and you got married in a big church...

1601
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:33,495
...and you had a honeymoon
in the south of France.

1602
02:04:33,662 --> 02:04:36,539
And you never had any trouble
of any kind.

1603
02:04:36,706 --> 02:04:40,460
So how can you possibly understand
how it is with Fred and me?

1604
02:04:43,628 --> 02:04:46,048
We never had any trouble.

1605
02:04:47,798 --> 02:04:52,470
How many times have I told you
I hated you and believed it in my heart?

1606
02:04:53,095 --> 02:04:56,306
How many times have you said
you were sick and tired of me...

1607
02:04:56,473 --> 02:04:57,974
...that we were all washed up?

1608
02:04:59,768 --> 02:05:04,146
How many times
have we had to fall in love all over again?

1609
02:05:23,746 --> 02:05:28,583
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-Oh, never mind about that, darling.

1610
02:05:56,857 --> 02:05:58,775
-Fred.
-Hi, Butch.

1611
02:05:58,942 --> 02:06:00,402
-Hello, Fred.
-Al here?

1612
02:06:00,568 --> 02:06:03,989
-Yeah, he's back there waiting for you.
-See you later.

1613
02:06:07,866 --> 02:06:10,827
-Hi, Al.
-Sit down, Fred.

1614
02:06:10,994 --> 02:06:12,912
-What are you drinking?
-A cup of coffee.

1615
02:06:13,079 --> 02:06:14,956
Gotta have a clear head for soda jerking.

1616
02:06:15,123 --> 02:06:17,791
-A cup of coffee and a bourbon and soda.
-Yes, sir.

1617
02:06:18,208 --> 02:06:21,545
Well, what's on your mind, Al?
Wanna borrow some money or something?

1618
02:06:23,379 --> 02:06:24,463
I...

1619
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:27,049
...called you to ask you a question.

1620
02:06:27,758 --> 02:06:30,552
Okay. Shoot.

1621
02:06:31,303 --> 02:06:32,971
Are you in love with Peggy?

1622
02:06:37,891 --> 02:06:40,144
Is there any law compelling me
to answer that one?

1623
02:06:40,311 --> 02:06:41,562
No.

1624
02:06:41,729 --> 02:06:45,898
Nevertheless, I repeat.
Are you in love with Peggy?

1625
02:06:49,985 --> 02:06:51,153
Yes.

1626
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:57,575
-I thank you for a short and honest answer.
-You're welcome.

1627
02:06:57,742 --> 02:07:01,245
-Now, what do we take up next?
-Your wife.

1628
02:07:01,411 --> 02:07:03,371
What about her?

1629
02:07:03,538 --> 02:07:06,666
Where does she fit
in this romantic situation?

1630
02:07:06,833 --> 02:07:09,335
Is that any of your business?

1631
02:07:10,085 --> 02:07:13,088
That's what Peggy said,
that it's none of my business.

1632
02:07:13,255 --> 02:07:15,214
Oh, you've had her on the carpet too.

1633
02:07:15,381 --> 02:07:19,177
She volunteered some information
to her mother and me.

1634
02:07:19,344 --> 02:07:23,555
You see, we have
a rather unusual relationship in our family.

1635
02:07:23,722 --> 02:07:28,643
It may seem kind of corny and
mid-Victorian, but we tell each other things.

1636
02:07:29,185 --> 02:07:31,395
I happen to be quite fond of Peggy,
and I....

1637
02:07:31,562 --> 02:07:34,105
You don't want her to get mixed up
with a heel like me.

1638
02:07:34,272 --> 02:07:37,192
I haven't called you a heel. Yet.

1639
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:40,277
I just don't wanna see her
get into this mess.

1640
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:53,538
Okay, chum, what do we do now?

1641
02:07:53,705 --> 02:07:56,249
Step out and settle this thing
in the alley?

1642
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:59,126
I wouldn't wanna recommend that
as a solution.

1643
02:07:59,293 --> 02:08:01,712
I've learned a lot of tricks
in fighting dirty.

1644
02:08:01,879 --> 02:08:05,256
If I got tangled up with you,
I might forget myself and break your neck.

1645
02:08:05,423 --> 02:08:07,384
I wouldn't like that.

1646
02:08:07,550 --> 02:08:10,720
You see, Fred, I'm quite fond of you too.

1647
02:08:11,221 --> 02:08:12,262
Thanks.

1648
02:08:12,429 --> 02:08:16,225
But I don't like the idea of you
sneaking around corners to see Peggy...

1649
02:08:16,392 --> 02:08:19,477
...taking her love on a bootleg basis.

1650
02:08:19,936 --> 02:08:21,854
I'm gonna do everything I can...

1651
02:08:22,021 --> 02:08:25,232
...to keep her away from you,
to help her forget about you...

1652
02:08:25,399 --> 02:08:28,402
...and get her married to some decent guy
who can make her happy.

1653
02:08:43,372 --> 02:08:45,541
Then I guess that's it, Al.

1654
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:47,960
I don't see her anymore.

1655
02:08:48,127 --> 02:08:51,087
I'll put that in the form of a guarantee.

1656
02:08:51,254 --> 02:08:53,548
I won't see her anymore.

1657
02:08:54,090 --> 02:08:56,258
I'll call her up and tell her so.

1658
02:08:56,425 --> 02:08:59,386
-That satisfy you?
-Yeah.

1659
02:09:00,304 --> 02:09:02,972
-Anything else on your mind?
-No.

1660
02:09:04,473 --> 02:09:07,351
Okay, chum, so long.

1661
02:09:07,518 --> 02:09:09,519
So long, Fred.

1662
02:09:11,605 --> 02:09:13,315
The drinks are on me.

1663
02:09:36,959 --> 02:09:38,794
-Hello, Homer.
-Hi, Steve.

1664
02:09:38,961 --> 02:09:41,004
Say, Al Stephenson's back there.

1665
02:09:41,171 --> 02:09:43,048
-Al?
-Yeah.

1666
02:09:44,257 --> 02:09:45,675
-Hi, Al.
-Hello, Homer.

1667
02:09:45,842 --> 02:09:47,968
-How are you? How's the family?
-Fine, thanks.

1668
02:09:48,135 --> 02:09:50,137
-Hello, Homer.
-Hi, Butch.

1669
02:09:50,304 --> 02:09:52,681
-Say, let's show Al that new routine.
-Why, sure.

1670
02:09:52,848 --> 02:09:56,100
Got something to show you, Al.
Well, come on.

1671
02:09:59,103 --> 02:10:01,647
-Boy, wait till you hear this.
-Are you all set, kid?

1672
02:10:01,813 --> 02:10:03,649
-I'm ready when you are.
-Okay.

1673
02:10:03,815 --> 02:10:05,984
One, two, three.

1674
02:10:53,482 --> 02:10:55,192
That's fine.

1675
02:10:55,818 --> 02:10:58,945
What's the matter? Didn't you like it?
We've been working for weeks.

1676
02:10:59,112 --> 02:11:02,907
Sure, Homer, it was swell. I thought you
were kidding about those piano lessons.

1677
02:11:03,074 --> 02:11:05,909
Fred! Hey, Fred!

1678
02:11:07,369 --> 02:11:09,204
That was Fred.

1679
02:11:09,705 --> 02:11:11,038
Yeah.

1680
02:11:11,205 --> 02:11:14,709
-What's the matter? Is anything wrong?
-He had to go back to the drugstore.

1681
02:11:14,875 --> 02:11:17,168
Come on, Homer, buy me a drink.

1682
02:11:33,141 --> 02:11:34,767
Who was it?

1683
02:11:35,892 --> 02:11:37,394
Fred.

1684
02:11:42,982 --> 02:11:48,653
He said he's sorry for what happened,
but it was just one of those things.

1685
02:11:50,822 --> 02:11:55,409
He said it wouldn't be fair to his wife
for us to see each other anymore because...

1686
02:11:55,784 --> 02:12:00,748
...I'm obviously the kind of girl
that takes these things too seriously.

1687
02:12:01,748 --> 02:12:05,585
Then he said goodbye, very politely,
and hung up.

1688
02:12:09,755 --> 02:12:14,717
Well, I guess you and Dad
won't have to worry about me anymore.

1689
02:12:15,468 --> 02:12:18,971
That's the end of my career
as a home wrecker.

1690
02:12:29,438 --> 02:12:32,650
Mom, I know you feel sorry for me.

1691
02:12:32,815 --> 02:12:35,568
You think my poor little heart is broken.

1692
02:12:35,735 --> 02:12:40,948
But you can save your sympathy.
I can see things clearer now.

1693
02:12:41,615 --> 02:12:43,909
I made a fool of myself.

1694
02:12:44,076 --> 02:12:47,620
I'm getting some sense
hammered into me now.

1695
02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:50,915
I'm glad I'm out of that mess.

1696
02:12:51,082 --> 02:12:54,000
I'm glad I'll never see him again!

1697
02:12:58,504 --> 02:13:01,257
Two chocolate sundaes coming up.

1698
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:10,640
What about a ham and cheese
on whole wheat without any mustard?

1699
02:13:10,807 --> 02:13:13,684
Ham and cheese, dark,
save the mustard, coming up.

1700
02:13:36,661 --> 02:13:38,538
Here you are.

1701
02:13:39,998 --> 02:13:41,499
Thank you.

1702
02:13:43,333 --> 02:13:44,835
-Hello, Homer.
-Hi, Fred.

1703
02:13:45,002 --> 02:13:47,588
How've you been? Glad to see you.

1704
02:13:47,754 --> 02:13:49,589
-Say, Fred.
-Yeah?

1705
02:13:49,755 --> 02:13:51,549
What happened at Butch's?

1706
02:13:51,716 --> 02:13:55,844
-What do you mean?
-I mean, you and Al. Was there any trouble?

1707
02:13:56,011 --> 02:13:59,180
Oh, no, we were just having
a little friendly chat.

1708
02:14:01,099 --> 02:14:02,683
-There you are, sir.
-Thanks.

1709
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:05,185
-What'll it be, Homer?
-Oh, I don't care.

1710
02:14:05,352 --> 02:14:08,147
-Give me a chocolate sundae.
-Okay.

1711
02:14:10,356 --> 02:14:11,482
Hi.

1712
02:14:11,649 --> 02:14:13,943
-How are you, soldier?
-Sailor.

1713
02:14:14,110 --> 02:14:15,736
Excuse me.

1714
02:14:17,696 --> 02:14:19,281
Say...

1715
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:22,199
...do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

1716
02:14:22,366 --> 02:14:25,453
I know what it is. How did I get
these hooks, and how do they work?

1717
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:27,746
That's what everybody says
when they start off:

1718
02:14:27,913 --> 02:14:30,165
"Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?"

1719
02:14:30,332 --> 02:14:31,416
Well, I'll tell you.

1720
02:14:31,583 --> 02:14:34,210
I got sick and tired
of that old pair of hands I had.

1721
02:14:34,376 --> 02:14:38,088
You know, an awful lot of trouble
washing them and manicuring my nails.

1722
02:14:38,255 --> 02:14:40,715
So I traded them in
for a pair of these latest models.

1723
02:14:40,882 --> 02:14:44,052
They work by radar. Look.

1724
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:57,813
-Pretty cute, eh?
-You got plenty of guts.

1725
02:14:58,731 --> 02:15:02,067
It's terrible when you see a guy like you
that had to sacrifice himself.

1726
02:15:02,234 --> 02:15:03,276
And for what?

1727
02:15:05,278 --> 02:15:07,821
And for what? I don't get you, mister.

1728
02:15:07,988 --> 02:15:09,573
-Well--
-Anything else for you?

1729
02:15:09,740 --> 02:15:11,075
Check.

1730
02:15:11,742 --> 02:15:13,952
We let ourselves get sold down the river.

1731
02:15:14,118 --> 02:15:16,955
-We were pushed into war.
-Sure, by the Japs and the Nazis.

1732
02:15:17,121 --> 02:15:18,997
-So we had--
-The Germans and the Japs...

1733
02:15:19,164 --> 02:15:22,584
...had nothing against us. They wanted
to fight the Limeys and the Reds.

1734
02:15:22,751 --> 02:15:24,461
And they would've whipped them too...

1735
02:15:24,628 --> 02:15:28,756
...if we didn't get deceived into it
by a bunch of radicals in Washington.

1736
02:15:28,923 --> 02:15:31,216
What are you talking about?

1737
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,594
We fought the wrong people, that's all.

1738
02:15:34,761 --> 02:15:36,846
Just read the facts, my friend.

1739
02:15:37,013 --> 02:15:39,431
Find out for yourself
why you had to lose your hands.

1740
02:15:39,598 --> 02:15:41,267
And then go do something about it.

1741
02:15:41,433 --> 02:15:44,269
You'd better pay your check, brother,
and go home.

1742
02:15:44,435 --> 02:15:48,022
-Well, who do you think you are?
-Pay the cashier right over there.

1743
02:15:48,189 --> 02:15:50,191
-Coffee, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

1744
02:15:50,357 --> 02:15:51,441
There's another thing.

1745
02:15:51,608 --> 02:15:55,571
Every soda jerk in this country
has got an idea he's somebody.

1746
02:16:04,661 --> 02:16:06,788
Look here, mister,
what are you selling anyway?

1747
02:16:06,955 --> 02:16:10,249
I'm not selling anything
but plain old-fashioned Americanism.

1748
02:16:10,416 --> 02:16:13,794
Some Americanism.
So we're all a bunch of suckers, eh?

1749
02:16:13,961 --> 02:16:16,713
So we should've been on the side
of the Japs and the Nazis?

1750
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:20,466
Again, I say, just look at the facts.

1751
02:16:20,633 --> 02:16:22,010
I've seen a couple of facts.

1752
02:16:22,175 --> 02:16:25,262
I've seen a ship go down
and over 400 of my shipmates went with it.

1753
02:16:25,429 --> 02:16:27,347
Were those guys suckers?

1754
02:16:27,514 --> 02:16:28,973
That's the unpleasant truth.

1755
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:31,726
And the sooner we get wise to it,
the better off we're--

1756
02:16:31,893 --> 02:16:36,897
-Oh, if I only had my hands!
-You put those down!

1757
02:16:37,898 --> 02:16:39,399
Take your hands off of him!

1758
02:16:49,949 --> 02:16:52,076
May I get through, please?

1759
02:16:53,328 --> 02:16:55,329
-Go get the druggist.
-Yes, sir.

1760
02:16:55,495 --> 02:16:59,166
-Make way, please. What happened?
-It was Fred Derry. He hit him.

1761
02:16:59,333 --> 02:17:01,667
Bring some spirits of ammonia,
iodine and bandages.

1762
02:17:01,834 --> 02:17:02,877
Yes, sir.

1763
02:17:03,044 --> 02:17:04,503
Don't say it, chum.

1764
02:17:04,670 --> 02:17:08,840
The customer's always right, so I'm fired.
But this customer wasn't right.

1765
02:17:09,007 --> 02:17:11,384
I'll meet you outside in a minute, kid.

1766
02:17:48,666 --> 02:17:52,085
Gee, Fred, I'm sorry I lost you your job.

1767
02:17:52,252 --> 02:17:54,295
-But that guy--
-Yeah, I know.

1768
02:17:54,462 --> 02:17:58,215
You read about guys like that,
but you don't often see them, luckily.

1769
02:17:59,758 --> 02:18:04,095
How about your girlfriend, Wilma?
You and she gonna get married?

1770
02:18:04,262 --> 02:18:06,389
-I don't know.
-Why don't you know?

1771
02:18:06,556 --> 02:18:10,101
-Doesn't she want to get married?
-Oh, it isn't Wilma's fault.

1772
02:18:10,268 --> 02:18:11,810
She's been swell about it.

1773
02:18:11,977 --> 02:18:15,272
-So then it's your fault?
-Yeah, I....

1774
02:18:16,064 --> 02:18:17,898
I guess it is.

1775
02:18:18,649 --> 02:18:21,819
-Will you do me a favor, Homer?
-Sure, Fred, what is it?

1776
02:18:21,986 --> 02:18:26,322
I'm a hot one to be giving advice
to the lovelorn, but go see Wilma now.

1777
02:18:26,489 --> 02:18:30,576
Take her in your arms, kiss her,
ask her to marry you, then marry her.

1778
02:18:30,742 --> 02:18:32,911
Tomorrow,
if you can get a license that fast.

1779
02:18:33,078 --> 02:18:35,789
If you want anybody to stand up for you
at your wedding....

1780
02:18:35,955 --> 02:18:39,792
-There's my bus. So long, kid.
-So long, Fred.

1781
02:20:28,342 --> 02:20:31,427
-You all right, Homer?
-Yes, Pop, I'm going to get a glass of milk.

1782
02:20:31,594 --> 02:20:33,680
Well, just knock on the door
when you want me.

1783
02:20:33,847 --> 02:20:35,306
Okay.

1784
02:21:07,792 --> 02:21:10,252
Wilma. What are you doing
out this hour of night?

1785
02:21:10,419 --> 02:21:14,006
I saw you were up, Homer.
I saw you through the window.

1786
02:21:14,464 --> 02:21:18,676
-I've got to talk to you.
-All right, come in.

1787
02:21:26,975 --> 02:21:29,226
-Want some chicken?
-No, thanks.

1788
02:21:29,393 --> 02:21:32,188
-Sure?
-Yes.

1789
02:21:33,189 --> 02:21:35,815
-Want a glass of milk?
-No, thanks, Homer.

1790
02:21:35,982 --> 02:21:37,901
Sit down, Wilma.

1791
02:21:38,818 --> 02:21:44,156
Homer, my family want me to go away.
Tomorrow.

1792
02:21:45,449 --> 02:21:50,286
-Where?
-Up to Silver Lake, at my Aunt Vera's place.

1793
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:55,665
That ought to be nice.

1794
02:21:55,832 --> 02:22:00,336
But I don't want to go.
I want to stay here.

1795
02:22:02,129 --> 02:22:06,341
You see, the reason they want me to go
is so that I'll forget about you.

1796
02:22:06,508 --> 02:22:10,178
They figure you don't want me around,
you don't wanna see me...

1797
02:22:10,345 --> 02:22:14,139
...and if I go away for a while,
maybe I'll get all this out of my mind.

1798
02:22:15,015 --> 02:22:19,644
Maybe that's a good idea, Wilma.
Maybe you ought to do that.

1799
02:22:20,770 --> 02:22:23,189
Do you wanna get rid of me?

1800
02:22:24,941 --> 02:22:29,402
Tell me the truth, Homer.
Do you want me to forget about you?

1801
02:22:35,866 --> 02:22:40,495
I want you to be free, Wilma.
To live your own life.

1802
02:22:41,329 --> 02:22:47,292
I don't want you tied down forever
just because you've got a kind heart.

1803
02:22:47,459 --> 02:22:51,379
Homer, why can't you ever understand
the way things really are...

1804
02:22:51,546 --> 02:22:55,133
...the way I really feel?
I keep trying to tell you.

1805
02:22:57,051 --> 02:22:59,886
But you don't know, Wilma.

1806
02:23:01,388 --> 02:23:05,015
You don't know what it'd be like
to have to live with me...

1807
02:23:05,182 --> 02:23:10,603
...to have to face this every day,
every night.

1808
02:23:10,770 --> 02:23:13,314
But I can only find out by trying.

1809
02:23:13,481 --> 02:23:17,568
And if it turns out I haven't
courage enough, we'll soon know it.

1810
02:23:27,785 --> 02:23:32,247
Wilma, you and I have been close
to each other for a long time, haven't we?

1811
02:23:32,414 --> 02:23:34,791
Ever since we were kids.

1812
02:23:37,168 --> 02:23:38,961
Yes, Homer.

1813
02:23:43,173 --> 02:23:45,592
I'm going upstairs to bed.

1814
02:23:47,635 --> 02:23:52,181
I want you to come up
and see for yourself what happens.

1815
02:23:57,643 --> 02:23:59,645
All right, Homer.

1816
02:24:50,647 --> 02:24:53,065
I've learned how to take this harness off.

1817
02:25:02,907 --> 02:25:05,492
I can wiggle into my pajama top.

1818
02:25:14,125 --> 02:25:16,168
I'm lucky, I have my elbows.

1819
02:25:16,335 --> 02:25:19,671
Some of the boys don't.
But I can't button them up.

1820
02:25:19,838 --> 02:25:21,881
I'll do that, Homer.

1821
02:25:45,693 --> 02:25:50,113
This is when I know I'm helpless.
My hands are down there on the bed.

1822
02:25:50,280 --> 02:25:54,033
I can't put them on again
without calling to somebody for help.

1823
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:57,035
I can't smoke a cigarette or read a book.

1824
02:25:57,369 --> 02:26:01,206
If that door should blow shut,
I can't open it and get out of this room.

1825
02:26:02,373 --> 02:26:06,878
I'm as dependent as a baby that doesn't
know how to get anything except cry for it.

1826
02:26:10,046 --> 02:26:12,215
Well, now you know, Wilma.

1827
02:26:12,883 --> 02:26:15,342
Now you have an idea of what it is.

1828
02:26:15,509 --> 02:26:19,180
I guess you don't know what to say.
It's all right.

1829
02:26:19,346 --> 02:26:23,057
Go on home.
Go away, like your family said.

1830
02:26:24,684 --> 02:26:26,853
I know what to say, Homer.

1831
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:28,437
I love you.

1832
02:26:28,604 --> 02:26:32,733
And I'm never going to leave you. Never.

1833
02:27:05,594 --> 02:27:07,970
You mean you didn't mind?

1834
02:27:08,513 --> 02:27:12,766
Of course not. I told you I loved you.

1835
02:27:17,729 --> 02:27:23,609
I love you, Wilma.
I always have, and I always will.

1836
02:28:00,598 --> 02:28:04,143
Good night, darling. Sleep well.

1837
02:28:13,109 --> 02:28:14,944
Good night, Wilma.

1838
02:29:13,785 --> 02:29:17,455
Hey, Sugar. You'd better step on it,
or your husband will be home.

1839
02:29:17,622 --> 02:29:21,041
Oh, don't worry. He's job hunting.
He won't come home for another hour.

1840
02:29:21,208 --> 02:29:23,710
-And what if he does?
-I don't understand it.

1841
02:29:23,877 --> 02:29:26,921
Guy like that with all this money around
and he can't get into it.

1842
02:29:27,088 --> 02:29:30,216
-What's the matter with him?
-I guess he just isn't very bright.

1843
02:29:36,513 --> 02:29:37,931
How do you do?

1844
02:29:38,931 --> 02:29:41,391
Fine, thanks. Who are you?

1845
02:29:41,558 --> 02:29:44,520
Fred, I want you to meet Cliff Scully,
an old friend of mine.

1846
02:29:44,686 --> 02:29:47,647
-Hi, Freddy.
-Glad to know you, Scully. Get out.

1847
02:29:47,814 --> 02:29:49,190
A tough guy, huh?

1848
02:29:49,357 --> 02:29:52,401
Now listen, Fred. You're not gonna get
anywhere with that attitude.

1849
02:29:52,567 --> 02:29:56,071
Cliff Scully's an old friend of mine.
He's asked me out, and I'm going out.

1850
02:29:56,238 --> 02:29:57,863
If you don't like it,
you know what you can do.

1851
02:29:58,030 --> 02:29:59,323
You heard me, chum. Get out.

1852
02:29:59,490 --> 02:30:03,577
-What do I do next? Smack him.
-Why ask her? Can't you think for yourself?

1853
02:30:03,744 --> 02:30:06,579
Go on Cliff. I can handle this.
Wait for me downstairs.

1854
02:30:06,746 --> 02:30:08,331
Okay.

1855
02:30:18,589 --> 02:30:20,383
Another ex-serviceman, huh?

1856
02:30:20,550 --> 02:30:23,802
Greetings, brother. Have you
had any trouble getting readjusted?

1857
02:30:23,969 --> 02:30:28,098
Not in particular. It's easy if you just
take everything in your stride.

1858
02:30:28,557 --> 02:30:30,015
That's what I've heard.

1859
02:30:34,270 --> 02:30:36,730
-Be seeing you.
-I doubt it.

1860
02:30:38,523 --> 02:30:41,526
-When did you pick him up?
-I told you. He's an old friend.

1861
02:30:41,693 --> 02:30:44,611
He just dropped in for a friendly drink.

1862
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:49,782
-Did you know him while I was away?
-I knew lots of people.

1863
02:30:49,949 --> 02:30:52,034
What do you think I was doing
all those years?

1864
02:30:52,201 --> 02:30:55,287
-I don't know, but I can guess.
-Go ahead, guess your head off.

1865
02:30:55,454 --> 02:30:57,038
I could do some guessing myself.

1866
02:30:57,205 --> 02:31:00,709
What were you up to in London
and Paris and all those places?

1867
02:31:00,876 --> 02:31:03,627
I've given you every chance
to make something of yourself.

1868
02:31:03,794 --> 02:31:05,755
I gave up my own job
when you asked me.

1869
02:31:05,921 --> 02:31:08,757
I gave up the best years of my life.
And what have you done?

1870
02:31:08,923 --> 02:31:12,469
You've flopped. Couldn't even hold that job
at the drugstore.

1871
02:31:12,635 --> 02:31:14,344
So I'm going back to work for myself.

1872
02:31:14,511 --> 02:31:16,555
That means I'm going to live
for myself too.

1873
02:31:16,722 --> 02:31:20,767
And in case you don't understand English,
I'm gonna get a divorce.

1874
02:31:20,933 --> 02:31:23,144
What have you got to say to that?

1875
02:31:28,815 --> 02:31:30,525
Don't keep Cliff waiting.

1876
02:31:33,486 --> 02:31:36,030
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm going away.

1877
02:31:36,197 --> 02:31:40,283
-Where?
-As far away from Boone City as I can get.

1878
02:31:40,450 --> 02:31:44,871
That's a good idea.
You'll get a good job someplace else.

1879
02:31:45,038 --> 02:31:48,123
There are drugstores everywhere.

1880
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:25,780
Here's an old sweater I found.

1881
02:32:25,947 --> 02:32:28,032
-Remember you wore it in high school?
-Sure.

1882
02:32:28,199 --> 02:32:30,326
-You might need it sometime.
-Thanks, Hortense.

1883
02:32:30,493 --> 02:32:34,746
-You forgot these, son.
-Oh, I don't want them, Pop.

1884
02:32:34,913 --> 02:32:35,956
What are they?

1885
02:32:36,123 --> 02:32:39,625
Just a lot of fancy words that don't mean
anything. You can throw them away.

1886
02:32:39,792 --> 02:32:43,254
Say, these are citations for your medals.

1887
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:45,588
Why, Freddy,
you never showed them to us.

1888
02:32:45,755 --> 02:32:48,550
Those things came in the packages
of K rations.

1889
02:32:48,717 --> 02:32:51,343
Well, we'll treasure them, my boy.

1890
02:32:51,510 --> 02:32:54,221
I'll get the socks I washed for you.

1891
02:32:56,639 --> 02:33:00,309
-Think you're doing the right thing, son?
-You mean going?

1892
02:33:00,476 --> 02:33:03,895
Who's to say in advance whether
it's the right thing or the wrong thing?

1893
02:33:04,062 --> 02:33:06,690
It just means a fresh start
in some other place.

1894
02:33:06,857 --> 02:33:09,567
How do you know
it'll be different anyplace else?

1895
02:33:09,734 --> 02:33:14,280
There's a need here for fellas like yourself
that fought and won the war.

1896
02:33:14,864 --> 02:33:17,824
I know you haven't had the best of breaks
since you got back...

1897
02:33:17,991 --> 02:33:21,910
...but, well, it seems like
you ought to stick here...

1898
02:33:22,077 --> 02:33:25,873
...and slug it out a while longer
on your own home ground.

1899
02:33:27,458 --> 02:33:29,417
You're all right, Pop.

1900
02:33:29,584 --> 02:33:32,045
But I know when it's time to bail out.

1901
02:33:33,046 --> 02:33:34,755
I gotta get going.

1902
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:43,262
-Here are your clean socks, Fred.
-Just put them in here.

1903
02:33:44,555 --> 02:33:47,307
-Take good care of the old man, won't you?
-I'll do my best.

1904
02:33:47,474 --> 02:33:51,311
-But we'll miss you, Freddy.
-You ought to be used to that by now.

1905
02:33:52,187 --> 02:33:53,937
So long, Pop.

1906
02:34:21,878 --> 02:34:24,798
I'll tell you, captain.
We've got two flights going out tonight.

1907
02:34:24,964 --> 02:34:28,342
One eastbound, one westbound.
You'll have to ask the pilot.

1908
02:34:28,509 --> 02:34:32,053
-Which way you going?
-Which one leaves first?

1909
02:34:33,137 --> 02:34:35,139
Eastbound, 8:00.

1910
02:34:35,306 --> 02:34:39,059
That'll be fine.
I'll just hang around the field until then.

1911
02:34:39,226 --> 02:34:41,353
Say, you don't seem to care
where you're going.

1912
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:44,022
That's right, chum. I don't.

1913
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:58,992
Hortense.

1914
02:34:59,952 --> 02:35:04,580
Hortense! Listen to this. Sit down.

1915
02:35:04,747 --> 02:35:10,502
''Headquarters, Eighth Air Force.
Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross.''

1916
02:35:11,002 --> 02:35:12,379
Here.

1917
02:35:13,004 --> 02:35:16,590
''Despite intense pain,
shock and loss of blood...

1918
02:35:16,757 --> 02:35:19,719
...with complete disregard
of his personal safety...

1919
02:35:19,885 --> 02:35:22,513
...Captain Derry crawled
back to his bombsight...

1920
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:25,932
...guided his formation
on a perfect run over the objective...

1921
02:35:26,099 --> 02:35:29,143
...and released his bombs
with great accuracy.

1922
02:35:29,309 --> 02:35:33,439
The heroism, devotion to duty,
professional skill...

1923
02:35:33,605 --> 02:35:38,484
...and coolness under fire
displayed by Captain Derry...

1924
02:35:40,111 --> 02:35:44,531
...under the most difficult conditions,
reflect highest credit upon himself...

1925
02:35:44,698 --> 02:35:49,368
...and the Armed Forces
of the United States of America.

1926
02:35:50,619 --> 02:35:54,540
By command
of Lieutenant General Doolittle.''

1927
02:39:02,073 --> 02:39:04,533
Hey, bud, what are you doing up there?

1928
02:39:07,369 --> 02:39:08,953
Hey, you!

1929
02:39:10,288 --> 02:39:12,831
What are you doing in that airplane?

1930
02:39:34,350 --> 02:39:37,061
I used to work in one of those.

1931
02:39:37,228 --> 02:39:38,895
Reviving old memories, huh?

1932
02:39:39,062 --> 02:39:41,606
Yeah, or maybe getting some of them
out of my system.

1933
02:39:41,773 --> 02:39:44,858
Well, take your last look at these crates.
We're breaking them up.

1934
02:39:45,025 --> 02:39:48,821
Yeah, I know. You're the junkman.
You get everything sooner or later.

1935
02:39:48,988 --> 02:39:50,030
This is no junk.

1936
02:39:50,197 --> 02:39:52,949
We're using this material
for building prefabricated houses.

1937
02:39:54,951 --> 02:39:56,910
You don't need any help, do you?

1938
02:39:57,077 --> 02:39:59,121
-Out of a job?
-That's it.

1939
02:39:59,287 --> 02:40:02,624
I see. One of the fallen angels
of the Air Force.

1940
02:40:02,791 --> 02:40:05,084
Well, pardon me if I show no sympathy.

1941
02:40:05,251 --> 02:40:08,295
While you glamour boys were up
in the wild blue yonder...

1942
02:40:08,462 --> 02:40:10,422
-...I was down in a tank.
-Listen, chum.

1943
02:40:10,588 --> 02:40:13,508
Sometime I'll be glad to hear
the story of your war experiences.

1944
02:40:13,675 --> 02:40:16,760
What I asked you for was a job.
Have you got one?

1945
02:40:17,428 --> 02:40:19,096
Do you know anything about building?

1946
02:40:19,263 --> 02:40:21,932
No. But there's one thing I do know,
I know how to learn.

1947
02:40:22,099 --> 02:40:24,267
Same as I learned that job up there.

1948
02:40:27,103 --> 02:40:29,229
-Hey, Gus.
-Yes?

1949
02:40:29,396 --> 02:40:31,815
See if you think this guy can be
of any use to us.

1950
02:40:31,982 --> 02:40:33,442
Thanks.

1951
02:40:44,451 --> 02:40:47,120
Now, children, let's remember the words.

1952
02:40:47,287 --> 02:40:51,582
The bride will come down those stairs.
And when I see her, I'll hit the first note...

1953
02:40:51,749 --> 02:40:54,751
...then I'll nod my head
and then we'll sing.

1954
02:40:54,917 --> 02:40:56,544
All right, let's try it.

1955
02:40:58,129 --> 02:40:59,714
-Here she comes.
-Here.

1956
02:40:59,881 --> 02:41:01,798
Wait for the note.

1957
02:41:03,967 --> 02:41:05,594
That's fine.

1958
02:41:12,642 --> 02:41:13,892
-Mrs. Cameron?
-Yes.

1959
02:41:14,059 --> 02:41:15,226
-Mrs. Stephenson?
-Yes.

1960
02:41:15,393 --> 02:41:16,895
Come right in, won't you?

1961
02:41:17,062 --> 02:41:18,647
-My daughter.
-How do you do?

1962
02:41:18,813 --> 02:41:21,023
-How do you do?
-How do you do, Mr. Stephenson?

1963
02:41:21,190 --> 02:41:23,359
-For you.
-Oh, my. You shouldn't have.

1964
02:41:23,525 --> 02:41:25,194
-My daughter.
-Miss Stephenson.

1965
02:41:25,361 --> 02:41:26,778
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Cameron.

1966
02:41:26,944 --> 02:41:28,279
-Pleasure.
-Nice to see you.

1967
02:41:28,446 --> 02:41:29,489
Homer's folks.

1968
02:41:29,656 --> 02:41:31,491
Mr. and Mrs. Stephenson.
Ms. Stephenson.

1969
02:41:31,658 --> 02:41:34,493
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

1970
02:41:34,660 --> 02:41:36,662
-Hello, Al. Good you're here.
-Hello, Butch.

1971
02:41:36,828 --> 02:41:38,288
Good to see you. Thank you.

1972
02:41:38,455 --> 02:41:41,374
-Hello, Butch.
-How do you do, Mrs. Stephenson?

1973
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:43,334
How do you do?

1974
02:41:47,337 --> 02:41:49,339
Steady, boy.

1975
02:41:53,676 --> 02:41:56,553
Gee, Fred, you had me worried.
I heard you were leaving town.

1976
02:41:56,720 --> 02:42:01,474
-I was afraid you wouldn't stand up for me.
-I'll stand up for you, kid, till I drop.

1977
02:42:01,641 --> 02:42:06,269
Oh, Fred, here's the ring. Don't lose it.

1978
02:42:07,437 --> 02:42:10,690
-Hi, Homer. Big day, huh?
-Hi, Al.

1979
02:42:10,856 --> 02:42:14,485
-Hi, Fred.
-Hello, Al.

1980
02:42:15,569 --> 02:42:19,072
-I hear you moved back with your folks.
-Yeah.

1981
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:23,534
I've been sampling the punch.
I presume it was made for the kiddies.

1982
02:42:23,701 --> 02:42:26,453
-Will you have some, Homer?
-I'd better not, Al.

1983
02:42:26,620 --> 02:42:29,081
-I might give the wrong answers.
-How about you, Fred?

1984
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:31,708
No, thanks. Maybe later.

1985
02:42:31,874 --> 02:42:35,003
Well, if I must be a solitary drinker,
good luck, kid.

1986
02:42:35,169 --> 02:42:36,211
Thank you, Al.

1987
02:42:36,378 --> 02:42:38,922
-Al! You promised you wouldn't.
-Now, listen, darling.

1988
02:42:39,089 --> 02:42:40,299
-Take a sip.
-Fred. Homer.

1989
02:42:40,465 --> 02:42:43,050
You'll realize there isn't a headache
in a barrel of it.

1990
02:42:43,217 --> 02:42:45,678
Don't worry about Al,
Mrs. Stephenson, he can take it.

1991
02:42:45,845 --> 02:42:47,221
-He certainly can.
-Excuse me.

1992
02:42:47,388 --> 02:42:49,472
Here, see for yourself.

1993
02:43:24,419 --> 02:43:25,587
Hello, Fred.

1994
02:43:25,754 --> 02:43:29,632
-Nice to see you again.
-Hello, Peggy. Nice to see you.

1995
02:43:31,425 --> 02:43:34,594
Well, what have you been
doing with yourself lately?

1996
02:43:35,094 --> 02:43:36,679
Working.

1997
02:43:38,931 --> 02:43:40,474
Yes.

1998
02:43:40,641 --> 02:43:43,602
Dad told me he heard
you were in some kind of building work.

1999
02:43:45,103 --> 02:43:49,774
Well, that's a hopeful way of putting it.
I'm really in the junk business.

2000
02:43:50,232 --> 02:43:54,110
An occupation for which many people feel
I'm well qualified...

2001
02:43:54,277 --> 02:43:55,737
...by temperament and training.

2002
02:43:56,780 --> 02:43:58,740
It's fascinating work.

2003
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:05,120
-Where's Homer? Wilma's ready.
-I'll get him. Excuse me.

2004
02:44:07,372 --> 02:44:11,542
Come on, children. Mary, Kay, go ahead.
Children. Jackie. Jackie!

2005
02:44:12,709 --> 02:44:14,169
Over here.

2006
02:44:31,475 --> 02:44:32,851
Watch me, now. Watch me.

2007
02:45:12,218 --> 02:45:15,387
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God...

2008
02:45:15,554 --> 02:45:17,306
...and in the face of this company...

2009
02:45:17,472 --> 02:45:21,476
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

2010
02:45:21,643 --> 02:45:25,938
If any man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together...

2011
02:45:26,105 --> 02:45:30,859
...let him now speak,
or else here after forever hold his peace.

2012
02:45:31,693 --> 02:45:34,362
Homer, wilt thou have
this woman to thy wedded wife?

2013
02:45:34,528 --> 02:45:35,779
I will.

2014
02:45:35,946 --> 02:45:39,033
Wilma, wilt thou have
this man to thy wedded husband?

2015
02:45:39,199 --> 02:45:40,534
I will.

2016
02:45:40,701 --> 02:45:43,077
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

2017
02:45:43,703 --> 02:45:45,038
I do.

2018
02:45:45,204 --> 02:45:50,417
Now, Homer, will you take Wilma's
right hand in yours and say after me.

2019
02:45:51,710 --> 02:45:54,545
I, Homer, take thee,
Wilma, to my wedded wife.

2020
02:45:54,712 --> 02:45:57,381
I, Homer, take thee,
Wilma, to my wedded wife.

2021
02:45:57,548 --> 02:46:00,216
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

2022
02:46:00,383 --> 02:46:02,844
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

2023
02:46:03,011 --> 02:46:06,222
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

2024
02:46:06,388 --> 02:46:09,224
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

2025
02:46:09,391 --> 02:46:13,895
In sickness and in health.
To love and to cherish till death us do part.

2026
02:46:14,062 --> 02:46:15,605
In sickness and in health.

2027
02:46:15,772 --> 02:46:19,733
To love and to cherish till death do--
Us do part.

2028
02:46:20,734 --> 02:46:22,736
Now, Wilma, with your right hand...

2029
02:46:22,903 --> 02:46:26,405
...take Homer by his right hand
and say after me.

2030
02:46:28,783 --> 02:46:31,785
I, Wilma, take thee, Homer,
to my wedded husband.

2031
02:46:31,952 --> 02:46:34,788
I, Wilma, take thee, Homer,
to my wedded husband.

2032
02:46:34,955 --> 02:46:37,415
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

2033
02:46:37,958 --> 02:46:40,376
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

2034
02:46:40,542 --> 02:46:43,754
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

2035
02:46:43,921 --> 02:46:46,756
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

2036
02:46:46,923 --> 02:46:51,593
In sickness and in health.
To love and to cherish till death us do part.

2037
02:46:52,261 --> 02:46:58,266
In sickness and in health.
To love and to cherish till death us do part.

2038
02:46:58,432 --> 02:47:00,059
The ring.

2039
02:47:06,231 --> 02:47:09,985
Place it on the fourth finger
of Wilma's left hand.

2040
02:47:32,461 --> 02:47:34,630
Repeat after me.

2041
02:47:35,089 --> 02:47:39,801
-With this ring, I thee wed.
-With this ring, I thee wed.

2042
02:47:46,473 --> 02:47:50,977
Those whom God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.

2043
02:47:51,144 --> 02:47:55,230
For as much as Homer and Wilma have
consented together in holy wedlock...

2044
02:47:55,397 --> 02:47:58,442
...and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

2045
02:47:58,609 --> 02:48:02,528
...and thereto have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other...

2046
02:48:02,695 --> 02:48:05,907
...and have declared the same
by giving and receiving a ring...

2047
02:48:06,073 --> 02:48:07,824
...and by joining hands...

2048
02:48:07,991 --> 02:48:13,079
...I pronounce that they are man and wife.
God bless you both.

2049
02:48:49,026 --> 02:48:54,239
You know what it'll be, don't you, Peggy?
It may take us years to get anywhere.

2050
02:48:54,614 --> 02:48:58,159
We'll have no money,
no decent place to live.

2051
02:48:58,326 --> 02:49:01,328
We'll have to work, get kicked around....
