00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:51,852

2
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:54,701
Thad.

3
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,290
I told you there was no grandfather.

4
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,101
But there is a crowd.

5
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,851
- Give it back!
- H .

6
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:03,310
- But give it back!
- Right!

7
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:07,660
Thad, I don't like you whimpering somebody.

8
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Learn how a guy himself arranges things.

9
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:13,901
Lovely kamu var zsg mb!

10
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,551
Will a guy ever be Thad?

11
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:23,302
Um, not the ones out there.

12
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,551
Tnkretetted!

13
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:40,051
Daddy!

14
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:41,168
Sid!

15
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:48,168
Help someone!

16
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:51,169
Segtsg!

17
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:20,418
H!

18
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,669
Thaddeus!

19
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:15,927
Thaddeus Sivana!

20
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:17,426
Who are you?

21
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:20,177
   And how do you know my name?

22
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:23,177
Vagyokn I am the last member of the janitor.

23
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:28,675
My job is to keep the heat cool from the heat.

24
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:36,861
But with time, I'm getting weaker.

25
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:41,361
I am looking for a champion to give my strength to.

26
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:44,701
Do you want to kn chase?

27
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:46,451
By.

28
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,701
I'll make all of this easy.

29
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,201
No!

30
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,401
Previous one use ...

31
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:03,134
You have to prove that you are a strong soul and you are true.

32
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:09,135
Lie!

33
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:12,386
Don't fuck her, champion!

34
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,135
Then let's put it up with force.

35
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,385
Take your eyes.

36
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,001
Your father is weak.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,781
Show that you are strong.

38
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,001
Not!

39
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,501
What is it?

40
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:54,002
Only the righteous can control the diminutive.

41
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,501
But you, you will never be gone.

42
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,752
Vrjon. I'm M ,lt , I guess.

43
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:09,869
- What?
- Let me go back!

44
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:11,961
- Right! Previously it was!
- Let me dad!

45
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:13,710
- Don't open the door.
- Calm down!

46
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,711
- Let me go back!
- You little bitch!

47
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,801
Hang on!

48
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,051
I was there before.

49
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,485
Him.

50
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:38,485
With a whistle.

51
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:39,985
He took me to the door, and ...

52
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:40,985
- Right!
- s ...

53
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:41,985
Elg! Finish!

54
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:47,985
You miserable, angry little sarcasm! We could have died.

55
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,985
Tell me, did you understand?

56
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,510
Father! Father!

57
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,011
Father!

58
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,011
Tlled!

59
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,510
Everything will be fine!

60
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,511
You are the cause.

61
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,261
That's because of you.

62
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:09,743
Not.

63
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:11,607
Dad.

64
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,243
Find me!

65
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,519
Your weakness is weak.

66
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:41,768
We'll get out of here soon.

67
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:47,268
Go ahead, find me a soul.

68
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,118
Anyone else.

69
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:53,452
It takes a long time.

70
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:04,201
SHAZAM!

71
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,294
H , but rough.

72
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:41,043
Get the cops out!

73
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:42,644
But he is here.

74
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:45,044
He says I spent time in time.

75
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,042
There they are.

76
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:48,794
Stay here.

77
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:53,544
Rendrsg!

78
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:56,294
I saw that they were there.

79
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,294
- Rend rs g, let's go in.
- Rend rs g!

80
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,644
- Nobody is here.
- How is that possible?

81
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:08,543
It's a cabinet.

82
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:10,293
Seriously, what?

83
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:13,545
H , h , h ! No, no, no!
H , kly k!

84
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:17,369
Go!

85
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:20,710
Let us out immediately!

86
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,961
This is a serious crime, you know?

87
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:26,212
Don't get into the car.
Come on, open me out.

88
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,461
Open it out. Come on.

89
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,051
H ezt this is, beef funny.

90
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:39,174
N V: RACHEL M. BATSON LAKCM:
21 HOFFMAN ST. PHILADELPHIA

91
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:44,393
Point of view strengthened by
Lonelmond into the business center.

92
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:50,393
Point of view, horn on the chest, a kisscap stole our walkie talk.

93
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:53,392
What's your voice?
Are you cool? t?

94
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:01,894
No, no, no! That's it!

95
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:07,668
Miss Batson.

96
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:10,029
I'm looking for something.

97
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,510
  , Jesus.

98
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:15,761
I'm the one, Billy.

99
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,011
Oh no.

100
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:33,010
- Oh.
- But I want the tiger.

101
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,170
I know my voice, I know.

102
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,511
But her mother is not like her.

103
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,762
   That's it.

104
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:46,627
- But I wanted the tiger.
- I know, but look.

105
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,376
This is a much more serious asset.

106
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,218
You see, this will be of use to you all.

107
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,718
You will always know where to go.

108
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:25,719
Maternal!

109
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:33,218
Maternal!

110
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:40,677
Maternal!

111
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,176
Hello! Who are you with?

112
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:50,177
Yes, she says Billy Batson.

113
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:52,676
Don't worry, csk s.

114
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:55,185
I'm sure you're looking for a mam. Oks?

115
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:57,016
It'll be here.

116
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:05,926
Maternal!

117
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,026
Hazajttem.

118
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:16,126
- Yes?
- Hell .

119
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:48,426
"Is Rachel Batson living here?"
- Who does it?

120
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:54,676
Well, I think you're the mother.

121
00:12:57,926 --> 00:13:00,428
Is that sure?

122
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:04,926
Sorry about the confusion.

123
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,926
Did you eat my food?

124
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,175
Fries left behind?

125
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:19,276
They got out of the Pittsburgh Children's Home to disappear after two weeks.

126
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,777
- I have to go back?
- No.

127
00:13:21,977 --> 00:13:24,025
They're not coming back.

128
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,119
Hardwood.

129
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:26,119
Just laugh.

130
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:30,369
But so far six counties out of their children's homes, Billy.

131
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,368
  s j  people.

132
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:37,869
Whoever loved you, you want to be the one you don't need.

133
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:42,860
It is time for someone to tell the truth in your eyes.

134
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,393
I am not k de  nomm, but I do not really want to get a shot.

135
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,744
I have a real mother-in-law.

136
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:48,493
Yes.

137
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,393
You're some investigator.

138
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:54,644
73 Batson, from 28 to 40 years old.

139
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,642
And none is your mother.

140
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:58,393
I'll find you.

141
00:13:58,593 --> 00:13:59,894
That's for sure.

142
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:12,893
Well, that's it. Outside there is a fire, Billy. The head is raised.

143
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:17,418
- I'll take care of myself.
- Minor or Art.

144
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:20,261
I won't let you down the street.

145
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:23,710
And looking for someone who has never been looking for.

146
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,510
Give them the chance.

147
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,010
Because they also give you.

148
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,511
There is no other possibility.

149
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,009
Hm. I say what the stuff is.

150
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,511
We know exactly what you are doing.

151
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:46,261
We also have to look up.

152
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:47,761
  , in the middle of the session.

153
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:51,034
I'm Chicky,  r kifj .
I always look at myself.

154
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:53,785
Yes, most of all, you put yourself in the armchair.

155
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:54,985
Because  reg.

156
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:56,401
Do you have  telallergi d, Billy?

157
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:58,302
You're better off if you have one.
Because he's firing.

158
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,376
- Finish!
- What!

159
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,718
I know how difficult it can be for you now.

160
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,468
  j h z. New faces.

161
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:07,217
They don't let go.

162
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:10,468
Wow, just loose.
Then you take the rhythm.

163
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:21,152
Ha!

164
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:26,901
Megjttnk!

165
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:29,152
You've gotten it, because it was nasty.

166
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:31,902
H t, that's what I can say.

167
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:35,102
Yeah, that little arm in the armchair, Eugene Choi.

168
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,585
Is it?

169
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,586
Oh, de j , Billy.

170
00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:40,085
  , relax, relax.

171
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:42,085
- Hi,  j tes .
- la Darla.

172
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,177
- I'm Darla.
- lelget g p.

173
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,335
I'll buy it.

174
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:47,585
You die, you die, you die!

175
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:50,335
He doesn't say this to you, just play.

176
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:55,085
H , you know that there is no time in the evening.

177
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:59,769
-  , when was it over?
- Yeah, the poster, I did it for you.

178
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:00,718
Take it!

179
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:01,818
  , no!

180
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,110
Sorry, Pedro  lland an train.

181
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,111
He wants to get himself out.

182
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:09,860
Mother, mother!

183
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,610
-   ...
- Tess k.

184
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:17,359
Yes. That's exactly what mathematics would be like for my perfect job.

185
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:20,043
It wasn't a rumor.

186
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:22,044
Sorry, I'm Mary. Hello.

187
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,443
I'm applying for a university.

188
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:25,543
- Billy.
- What do I do best?

189
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:28,292
  , this is a great thing.

190
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:29,542
I admit it, too.

191
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:32,385
- "What do I do best?"
- I do not know.

192
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:35,185
Say you are proud. Always stay awake.

193
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:38,136
At the very least, the best thing about the campus is.

194
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:42,227
I am brave, and I believe in the most strange places

195
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:45,318
you can find friends, and. lure.

196
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,319
This is going to get so bad.

197
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,069
Going to Celtic is a very good university.

198
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:52,819
It's just far away, California.

199
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,518
But I don't want you to talk about it now.

200
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,068
Because then I'll be sad.

201
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,409
Do you like veg n kaj?

202
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,252
- No.
-  n I take the scars.

203
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:04,501
Oh no, the tofu chicken.

204
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,251
Oh, no, we have to eat a real chicken.

205
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:07,426
- This is now...
- Nothing wrong.

206
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:09,344
Come on, I'll show you your room.

207
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:11,844
Little itr ltek h za, I know, but ...

208
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:12,594
Entertaining.

209
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:17,844
Watch out for the bad thing.
Pedro, my dear.

210
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:19,844
Hello. Call Bill.

211
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:23,935
Don't take it for yourself, everyone like that.

212
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:28,776
Freddy.

213
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:34,119
   Billy Batson, I want you home.

214
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,043
- All right?
- Yeah.

215
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:38,618
- Do not be too scary with the word.
- You know what's strange?

216
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:40,867
The fact that the Ramas are dying with their pisses.

217
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:44,868
-   ...
- But it is quite simple.

218
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:46,119
H t, mmm.

219
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:57,625
We are high on Baromi.

220
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,618
Believe me, I say from experience.

221
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:04,708
Viktor threw it away.

222
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:08,736
They look nice, but not in that.

223
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,986
Clear Trnnok battle that goes here.

224
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:14,236
We?

225
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:17,486
Relax, it's just a flutter.

226
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:22,167
I'm sorry, I have a hot day.

227
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,793
I'm kidding again! R mn zel,  s and you think we're in trouble,

228
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:29,269
you are just a cared for a disabled person, right?

229
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:33,918
Jaigen, that is  reg
"Batarang".

230
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:35,668
Of course not the original, but

231
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:36,918
fed h res.

232
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:38,852
With this you can open it in your room.

233
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,352
Or is it better "Supit"?

234
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:43,371
Yeah, well.

235
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,102
  s l m, this is St. Gr l.

236
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:49,350
This is the 9mm bullet that came out to Superman.

237
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,810
Original. I don't know, you can have 5-600 on it.

238
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,850
There is more to it.

239
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,602
- What's in the hoods?
- H !

240
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,601
Yeah, yeah. Not everything belongs to rm.

241
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,742
It won't bother you if you don't mind.

242
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:05,602
But you're gonna be here, cool place.

243
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:31,401
Dinner.

244
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,651
Let's see your hands.

245
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:43,742
Paws.

246
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,743
I am a fan of the family.
I'm happy with today's day.

247
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:50,836
I am also happy with  tel rt even if you do not know it.

248
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:58,085
They're coming here from here.
Do you think he's alien?

249
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:00,834
But just grab it so much how much you can get.

250
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:03,176
And then how many new friends.

251
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:05,677
The manager is Cherry. Jfej.

252
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:06,676
The following qualities.

253
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,268
This is the security scanner,
like the rept.

254
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:14,019
- You don't have to hang over.
- I know what this is.

255
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:15,835
Always such a chick?

256
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:17,019
hm.

257
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:19,111
Quietly, I don't keep myself coming.

258
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:21,060
But there would be a little silence.

259
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:27,702
- See the itj sulit, bty .
- Listen, you don't always have to shout.

260
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:30,202
We are not real, just like ...

261
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:32,700
I'm sorry.

262
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,636
- Let's go?
- Let's go.

263
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,385
But I didn't want to go to bed.

264
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:45,885
It was very hard when it was dry.

265
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:47,685
VARZSL

266
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:50,227
He said I had to be a clean dog.

267
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,726
Hogys that   var zsl ,

268
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:53,926
or what.

269
00:20:54,126 --> 00:20:56,819
He was just like that in Harry Potter.

270
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,660
He says that we are also doing this?

271
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,410
Similar, yes.

272
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,159
Do you remember exactly what he said?

273
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,661
That's what he's doing.

274
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,752
I saw a lot of statues.

275
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:15,502
They felt like me, and they seemed to enlighten my thoughts.

276
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,752
It was harsh.

277
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,750
Confirm that they have been shot?

278
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,343
Yes.

279
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:24,594
That's exactly what remained in my mind.

280
00:21:25,593 --> 00:21:27,111
But I didn't know how you know that ...

281
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:31,436
These and similar handles are characterized by a high degree of durability.

282
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:33,435
- T meghiszt ria.
- I know.

283
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,435
Kiss  expressions.

284
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:38,026
These are also the UF  selves.

285
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:40,527
Good. Rep l  slice.

286
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:43,776
It has happened to people who do not know each other

287
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:44,976
Szimblumok.

288
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:50,777
Arrange the symbols.

289
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:55,117
Eln z st, Miss Kvan,
let's say a little bit now

290
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:56,368
about symbols.

291
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:59,618
You may have seen such symbols

292
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,119
before you abduct yourself?

293
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:04,118
No, I don't remember symbols, no.

294
00:22:04,318 --> 00:22:06,368
I think I've taken a video.

295
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:07,802
There was something there.

296
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:11,302
I remember that the hairs are constantly on

297
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:12,301
vltoztak.

298
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:13,145
He picked it up?

299
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:16,893
I want to see the video.

300
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:19,893
. Miss Kvan. Meet
Dr. Sivanat.

301
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:22,895
A moment.
You know.

302
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,326
Who is? You g.

303
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:27,828
Who is there?

304
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,826
Ha! What's going on?

305
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:31,826
What is this?

306
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:35,418
Hvom the order.

307
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:41,918
Suddenly, the vacuum was taken from the air. And so I figured they were going somewhere.

308
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,261
And as if I was in a temple.

309
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,261
That thing, it's just ...

310
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:54,350
Dr. Sivana.

311
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:57,760
I am very keen on  gybuzgal.

312
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,194
But you only finance the project,
And there is no right to be heard

313
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:03,442
in the examinations.

314
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:05,534
So far, 50-60 people were abducted.

315
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:08,036
- I didn't mean that.
- What?

316
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:24,968
Dr.  r, what is this?

317
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:27,219
So many  ven  t.

318
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:32,969
I was sure the series was wrong.

319
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:34,559
Or.

320
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,310
The doors are not opened by those symbols.

321
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:42,560
But that woman is r j n

322
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,561
that cool symbol

323
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,560
The series.

324
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,311
It is repeated five times.

325
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,060
- That's the difference.
- It's a joke, right?

326
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,310
Maybe it is right now.

327
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,561
Because what we are looking at is nothing to do with hysterics.

328
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:07,836
These people are all, except for the ones

329
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:10,584
they all saw real things.

330
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:15,086
I just think a ra has failed,
And that is the reason

331
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:16,835
that they are looking for burglaries?

332
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,519
Come on.

333
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:21,518
Don't you think seriously that this is real?

334
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:35,769
Sure.

335
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:43,219
That's real.

336
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:23,520
You're looking for ...

337
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:25,717
For that minute.

338
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:29,018
And now he came.

339
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:31,343
You don't remember r m, right?

340
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:40,185
Remember me.

341
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:43,185
Kid's.

342
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:45,276
How dare you penetrate my empire?

343
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:49,526
Do you know how to tell a child to never get ahead?

344
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:50,525
You do not know.

345
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:56,528
What many of you have said before has made me more aware of who I am.

346
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:57,775
And you know what?

347
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:02,368
I am not a pure woman.

348
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:07,618
The javelin is weak to save you.

349
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,300
Not!

350
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,550
Noo!

351
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,643
You didn't find your champion.

352
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:28,094
But we found ours.

353
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,894
You're the real champion.

354
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:20,645
They cheated.

355
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:23,536
They are only used to get out of here.

356
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:31,536
They are all about you.

357
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:33,719
They just add.

358
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,468
Turn people against each other.

359
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:41,719
You are looking for a strong soul, but no one for you.

360
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:53,650
Are you raping or indecisive?

361
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:58,151
If you were superhero, would you be flying or being immovable?

362
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:01,152
Whatever, everybody wants to fly. You know what?

363
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:02,743
How can you fly away?

364
00:28:03,494 --> 00:28:06,243
No no. The heat is flying, and everyone wants to be cool, isn't it?

365
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:10,086
But, the indescribable, cool, a little bit of shit,

366
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:12,886
because people are afraid of you,
who don't even know you are there.

367
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:14,455
Wow, the more excited, isn't it?

368
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:25,269
They've made a survey, now it's serious. Always ask me the same thing

369
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,589
what kind of superer?

370
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:28,268
Only now has the whole world gone.

371
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:31,517
And since you are most aware of the secrecy, it is worthless.

372
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:34,768
Because, in my opinion, people do not keep themselves cool in their minds.

373
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:37,110
I know you want to talk.

374
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,859
Dude, you stole my Superman bullet.

375
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:41,702
J , emrtem,  rtem.

376
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:43,701
I was sucked well enough.

377
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:45,202
I don't mind anyone.

378
00:28:45,402 --> 00:28:47,451
This is when you are incredible.

379
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:49,295
You're completely alone.

380
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,043
I didn't steal your bula ball.

381
00:28:58,044 --> 00:29:00,293
What was the first day?

382
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:02,543
That's it, huh?

383
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:09,726
Jesus, Freddy!

384
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:12,475
- Everything okay? Are you right?
- Yes.

385
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:16,818
Hell, you're not normal.

386
00:29:17,018 --> 00:29:19,819
- That's what you punched.
- Are you paying the bill, Freeman?

387
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,319
That's because you did?

388
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,410
Yeah, of course, so are we?

389
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:29,661
Kent, stop it!

390
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:32,750
Don't hurt me!

391
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,427
What? Does your camouflage have to wear?

392
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:36,252
Are you so soft, Freeman?

393
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:39,121
Come on, what's going to happen?
Show me what you know!

394
00:29:39,293 --> 00:29:41,093
Are you going home now, and are the moms going?

395
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:43,593
  , sorry, you have no mammoth.

396
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:45,593
That's him!

397
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:46,592
H!

398
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:51,686
Oh, sorry, I didn't want to!
It wasn't a sports goods.

399
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:53,184
But you weren't the ones,

400
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:01,276
Don't be disappointed, because I'll pick you up!

401
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:04,877
A!

402
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,579
H! That's it!
Where are you running?

403
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,369
Freddy, are you?

404
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:16,211
H , let's go!
Then follow!

405
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,210
This is it.

406
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:25,301
You're not going!

407
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:28,301
Run, Run Run! Get it! Come on!

408
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:30,143
Watch it! There is! Fast!

409
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:37,488
- You have a mistake!
- You think you're funny?

410
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:39,984
In school we find  gyis!

411
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:44,735
The next one is Street 30.

412
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:47,985
For G s C lines.

413
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:07,261
Ha!

414
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:09,259
I didn't know what!

415
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,260
Segtsg!

416
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,810
H , but rough.

417
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,311
Ha!

418
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:31,926
What the hell?

419
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:33,677
Who's doing this?

420
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:06,884
J  day! ...

421
00:33:08,135 --> 00:33:10,385
I should have been off the metro, but now ...

422
00:33:10,585 --> 00:33:11,885
Billy Batson.

423
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:13,635
How do you know my name?

424
00:33:13,835 --> 00:33:17,385
Vagyokn I am the last member of the janitor.

425
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:20,980
Shape of the slate is Rocky.

426
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,976
Ah, yes.

427
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:25,976
Fell down.

428
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:28,244
The situation is that I don't have a penny.

429
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:30,321
Don't get me here, son.

430
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,411
Where you are now, it is the origin of every whirlwind.

431
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:38,661
This is Rocky Rock.

432
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:40,751
The heat is kept cool.

433
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:44,501
We chose a champion røges-r gen.

434
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:47,252
But we are irresponsible.

435
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:52,594
He used his power to revenge.

436
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:58,092
And he let go of the heat for yours.

437
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,344
More billions have died.

438
00:34:04,093 --> 00:34:08,026
Full civilizations were out of the field.

439
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:16,776
I promised that I wouldn't give my power until then,

440
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:20,526
am not able to find someone who has been working.

441
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:24,517
He who is strong in spirit, and pure in spirit.

442
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:27,210
H t, ye ...

443
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,710
This may be a crack.

444
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,210
I have no idea.

445
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,711
But I'm sure you're not looking for me.

446
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:36,709
Because I'm not a man.

447
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,211
I don't know if he's a man?

448
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,802
I can only pick you up.

449
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:47,551
Billy Batson, not just  n, is all about.

450
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:51,986
Put your hand on my bot.

451
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:52,984
F!

452
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:56,235
Tell me my name to see my power.

453
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:59,735
I'll open my mouth for you, Billy Batson.

454
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:01,736
Because it is r  or r .

455
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:04,485
You're the Exclusive! The champion!

456
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,735
Kssz. I like to be very kind, but now I have to go quite well.

457
00:35:08,935 --> 00:35:12,260
My brothers and sisters have been chosen by my sins.

458
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,011
Their three,  m  res!

459
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,261
I have to give my power more.

460
00:35:18,509 --> 00:35:19,260
Come on!

461
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:21,600
Tell me my name!

462
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:23,602
How do I know the name, sir?

463
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:24,851
Do not know him.

464
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:29,352
My name is azn: Shazam!

465
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:33,851
- This is serious?
- Say it!

466
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:51,376
Just tell me, right? Shazam!

467
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:57,218
Yes! I want to spare my strength!
And with all my strengths!

468
00:35:57,418 --> 00:35:58,717
Solomon's silence.

469
00:35:58,718 --> 00:36:00,067
The power of Hercules.

470
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,718
Atlas is a must.

471
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:03,419
Zeus power.

472
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,508
Achilles' clothing.

473
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:07,560
  s Mercury speed.

474
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:18,668
What about me?

475
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,493
What did he do to me?

476
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:21,994
What did you do with my voice?

477
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:25,493
Now you can do much more than you ever thought.

478
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:30,492
Open your mouth, and keep your true strength.

479
00:36:31,243 --> 00:36:33,943
Act on your skin and your skin.

480
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,518
How do I get out of here?

481
00:36:49,522 --> 00:36:51,526
Cool!

482
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:55,861
Teske! This rye is nothing!

483
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:58,361
Gold shoes, gold  v, feh r kpeny.

484
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:01,860
Disk f ling, but m gis is on the scene. Cute.

485
00:37:15,293 --> 00:37:16,043
Billy!

486
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:25,793
Yes, Lieutenant  r, I know he's gone out of the way, s ...

487
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:28,635
23 times?

488
00:37:29,136 --> 00:37:30,977
There is nothing on the net at all.

489
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:33,980
It is not up to you, as if it wasn't.

490
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:59,002
I'll look for Billy very soon.

491
00:37:59,202 --> 00:38:00,251
I'm serious.

492
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:03,093
But not. You need to wash it, it's more important.

493
00:38:03,293 --> 00:38:05,343
How could Freddy run over. Hahaha.

494
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:06,844
Beef is funny.

495
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:09,935
I figured ... not screaming ...!

496
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:12,435
- Viktor! Viktor!
- I'm ,n, Billy.

497
00:38:12,935 --> 00:38:15,835
Billy asked you to fly or not?

498
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:18,526
I said, cool, here,

499
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:20,126
So I look out. And now you need to help. Do you find yourself on the road?

500
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,568
What's up? Everything is alright?
 
501
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,543
Yes.

502
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:29,619
Yeah, I'm just a little sad that

503
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:35,118
Billy is gone, and maybe because of me, I'm the cause.

504
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:37,619
- I think I'm snoring.
- No no no.

505
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:39,618
He's not gone because of you, son.

506
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,620
We'll find you okay?

507
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:44,050
You're not snoring.

508
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:46,351
But you're gonna be silent.

509
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,236
H , h , h , hllenness!

510
00:38:58,735 --> 00:38:59,985
Chromatography of the residue! Don't come crazy!

511
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:01,985
How do I know you're not a supergon?

512
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:03,235
Who got into my brain?

513
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:04,995
And will you believe you are Billy?

514
00:39:05,195 --> 00:39:06,515
If? Ras hsvss

515
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:08,485
- I've set the order!
- No! Relax,

516
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:10,336
I have evidence. Oh, no, let's not.

517
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:12,986
Look, I lied. Amn I hit your ball.

518
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:17,326
Oh, yeah, no! Fell down.
Peel! B na feln ttk z.

519
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:19,918
But you saw it. You've seen it, right?

520
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:22,169
Trust me. Freddy, my husband, I'm legn, right.

521
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:25,409
Listen, I know we're not really big spans, but

522
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,959
but you are the one who knows something about the real justice.

523
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,351
- Batman.
- We?

524
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:30,351
Forget it.

525
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:31,751
Tkmindegy.

526
00:39:33,351 --> 00:39:36,350
- Free?
- Yeah, of course.

527
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:47,851
Jesus.

528
00:39:49,101 --> 00:39:50,101
What, huh?

529
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:52,034
   And what kind of superer?

530
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:55,285
Supersensitive? I still can't hug in this.

531
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,876
J. Say, can you fly?

532
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,376
Then, let's get it.

533
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:05,876
- How do we do that?
- Hey, just push Superman.

534
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:11,626
You must first jump publicly.

535
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,625
On!

536
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:14,626
And where do I know?

537
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:15,876
Figyuzz.

538
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:20,718
Then you have to believe that you can fly. I read a serious article

539
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,902
about superhero.  and firewood, in case it is believed

540
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:24,852
make hands r.

541
00:40:24,952 --> 00:40:27,651
I know. I know. I know.
Replni.

542
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,601
I believe I can fly.

543
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:32,743
Somehow.

544
00:40:40,245 --> 00:40:41,335
You believed?

545
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:46,334
Yes.

546
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:47,834
And the indecision?

547
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:50,836
But how?

548
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:53,585
Whatever. J.
He will go. He will go.

549
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,336
 , you g! Sikerlt!

550
00:40:59,536 --> 00:41:00,584
Where did you go?

551
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:03,810
I'm here. Didn't you see it?

552
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:05,767
Where? No!

553
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:07,519
Eltntem! I'm here.

554
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,610
Now here!

555
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,312
Lthatatlan.

556
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:16,201
H! Yes, edit it.

557
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:21,702
I think you have also tested superintelligence with indefiniteness.

558
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:24,543
Freeman do it because I hurry now.

559
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:34,544
That damn ...
There are some videos.

560
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:36,264
There, it was over, and you didn't buy it.

561
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:38,794
According to Sz.

562
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:50,227
What the hell? Listen, you need some superhosting.

563
00:42:02,726 --> 00:42:04,252
H. Yes! Piss ...

564
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:09,344
Hyper Speed. I got it.

565
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,843
  , sorry, sorry. I thought the woman was screaming.

566
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:16,344
I was hanging with a gun.

567
00:42:16,544 --> 00:42:17,842
All right.

568
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:21,435
H , h ! Rockos face, give it back to n sk   .

569
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:25,686
What do you say? And he could steal it because I was really.

570
00:42:25,886 --> 00:42:28,935
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He was a professional detachment.

571
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:32,276
Please note that it is old or older,

572
00:42:32,476 --> 00:42:34,201
like you, buy yourself.

573
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:36,118
J? Vgod? Tes?

574
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:40,368
- He's a man, but who are you?
- His name is "F nnyelver ".

575
00:42:40,568 --> 00:42:44,460
The h akis, who is not only strong, but shines, shimmers everything.

576
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,961
I'm not a pornstar!

577
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:49,801
- Mr. Feeling.
- I'm not a nerve gun.

578
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,958
Amperman, because he's gonna have to go, and gžpr

579
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:54,551
don't buy the supergonism.

580
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:57,302
Amperman, do you know this boy?

581
00:42:59,052 --> 00:43:00,801
Just a bit.
Not really.

582
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:03,643
Tnyleg.   my manager.
The little n ...

583
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:05,148
I'm Sim n's manager.

584
00:43:05,348 --> 00:43:07,068
Listen, the Amperman hasn't gone before.

585
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:08,486
Find something better.

586
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,985
H , h , h ! Dude.

587
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:18,076
Electric manipulation.
Hipersebessg. Supersensitive.

588
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:21,327
That's right there! You're almost like Superman.

589
00:43:22,325 --> 00:43:24,418
We didn't find you. I don't know what's going on in the past ...

590
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:26,169
I don't want to know.
Not just a mess.

591
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:27,689
Make this checker very easy.

592
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:30,028
No, no, but if you need help, cool the superhero

593
00:43:30,118 --> 00:43:34,511
- who can't fly.
- Hello, we're looking for a flight, $ 73.

594
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:36,261
$ 73?

595
00:43:36,461 --> 00:43:37,561
Warmly welcome!

596
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:41,601
H , let's just have a idea.

597
00:43:42,602 --> 00:43:45,852
They are the most exquisite bristles, cooler.

598
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,627
That's preceded.
We have no false certificates.

599
00:44:07,827 --> 00:44:10,127
H , Freddy, don't worry about everything.
Just look at me.

600
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:11,627
I'm the pass.

601
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:14,376
Unpack the cassette. Fast! Come on!

602
00:44:14,576 --> 00:44:15,877
Mozgs. Fast!

603
00:44:16,077 --> 00:44:17,468
Temp , temp .

604
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:19,618
The whole. Come on!

605
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:20,718
Here's a great opportunity.

606
00:44:21,218 --> 00:44:23,467
Yeah.  , right. He's right, everything.

607
00:44:24,217 --> 00:44:26,311
Hurry - hurry. Get into it!

608
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,480
This is it. This is it.

609
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,559
Gentlemen! What is a weapon, if you can set it up on a filial?

610
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,401
Billy, watch me!

611
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:53,151
Hey, you're a bullet!
LVEDD-immunits.

612
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:54,902
I'm a bullet!

613
00:44:56,401 --> 00:45:00,401
Sun, December 8th, and that's for sure.

614
00:45:01,426 --> 00:45:02,676
Lj rra jra.

615
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:04,768
Ah, yes. He, he, he. Here.

616
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,518
Both. Csapasstok.

617
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:15,361
Or, check it out!
We don't know that

618
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:18,861
you're a ball or a editor.

619
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,702
- Look on the face.
- Arcon?

620
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,451
A little bit of a trick.

621
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:33,950
Vgetek.

622
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:43,135
Sorry for the showcase. But the thing is that I got the robbers.

623
00:45:44,985 --> 00:45:46,135
Let's get out of here!

624
00:45:46,885 --> 00:45:49,726
Well, let's drink the bad guys.

625
00:45:54,976 --> 00:45:56,819
Concretely, light z .

626
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:01,659
Did you know if you eat a lot of dripping sausages from it

627
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,161
are the beled?

628
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,161
- Meg ri.
- And.

629
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:07,411
But you are not, because it is also supercar.

630
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:08,661
You become.

631
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,450
Cs  , peel? I'm superhero.

632
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:13,662
Yes,  s and   are not like Rezg ujj  Kapit ny.

633
00:46:13,862 --> 00:46:16,002
No it's not true. Tell him ...
This is not my name.

634
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:18,252
Listen, let's go.
We are about the same.

635
00:46:18,452 --> 00:46:20,343
Well, then, I'll go.

636
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:21,593
Oh, come on!

637
00:46:27,595 --> 00:46:29,935
That's the brutal origin.

638
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:33,735
Now I guess what Rocky was here for.

639
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:37,277
Listen, you are a much better head.

640
00:46:37,477 --> 00:46:38,776
All the time.

641
00:46:39,027 --> 00:46:43,026
Just don't look at it, but when we first met

642
00:46:43,226 --> 00:46:45,526
point of the opposite.

643
00:46:47,276 --> 00:46:48,118
One pÃ¼cs?

644
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:51,868
- You said it.
- No  n. But yes.

645
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,119
I think you are now in the crimes or bumps,

646
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,369
or sleep.

647
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:59,010
Hazamegynk?

648
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,301
- In this stuff?
- What's the matter?

649
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:05,801
In principle, what should be your hiding place.

650
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:07,301
But then, over time.

651
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:10,301
- It stays in the double-decker.
- Naja.

652
00:47:14,393 --> 00:47:16,894
I keep in mind that he's in trouble.

653
00:47:17,393 --> 00:47:18,893
Don't do it before.

654
00:47:20,643 --> 00:47:24,893
Now, if you find it, we'll get back to you.

655
00:47:25,235 --> 00:47:26,893
T rt with arms.

656
00:47:28,827 --> 00:47:31,736
He hadn't spent two days.
Just tap it.

657
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:34,275
Szvet. We will soon disappear.

658
00:47:34,276 --> 00:47:35,668
Ann sure.

659
00:47:36,918 --> 00:47:38,825
- Yes.
- S t, too, Larry.

660
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,077
Bi.

661
00:47:42,576 --> 00:47:46,076
Do you remember what you said when you first shot it?

662
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:51,919
It is the home of what   its heat. He has to say this.

663
00:47:55,169 --> 00:47:58,102
We can do it with love.

664
00:47:58,852 --> 00:48:01,193
Ks  r l l n, if you call us.

665
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:01,893
True?

666
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:04,244
Yes.

667
00:48:07,444 --> 00:48:09,036
Well, what's the tree?

668
00:48:10,285 --> 00:48:12,285
H ,t, so little simple.

669
00:48:13,986 --> 00:48:14,935
Ha!

670
00:48:15,786 --> 00:48:17,285
I'm just going to pee.

671
00:48:17,785 --> 00:48:19,534
Yeah, he's right, Freddy's my mouth.
J   jt.

672
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:21,035
- J   jt.
- J   jt.

673
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:24,878
- Freddy, who's here?
- Just Billy.

674
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:27,377
He has a burning, sore throat.

675
00:48:27,577 --> 00:48:29,469
- Are you normal?
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

676
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:31,468
But he was almost dead, so he would chick.

677
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:32,985
Csicsiklni? What is it to chick?

678
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,384
- Get out. Tns.
- Billy, come back?

679
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:35,111
Let me shoot you.

680
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:36,668
So I was worried ...

681
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:40,310
I told you this was a very bad idea.

682
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,310
- That!
- Freddy!

683
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,651
What did you look like?

684
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:49,651
Not! If you stick the nail, it's like you want to rob him.

685
00:48:52,152 --> 00:48:53,652
Listen, I'm ,n, Billy.

686
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:55,743
I look a little bit, a varnish changed.

687
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:58,224
Do not start with the ring.
He's going to get bad about it.

688
00:48:58,285 --> 00:49:00,335
Then a pipe was made to say:

689
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:01,436
Shazam!

690
00:49:02,885 --> 00:49:03,884
Rosa!

691
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:07,085
Skin-induced body manipulation.

692
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:09,085
You can change back with Shazam.

693
00:49:11,236 --> 00:49:12,935
Wow, what is it?
Are you right?

694
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,519
Yeah, I just turned the lights on.

695
00:49:17,017 --> 00:49:20,020
Well, listen to Darla.
Can't you talk about that, edrted?

696
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,018
But Billy is,  s now superh s.

697
00:49:22,218 --> 00:49:24,610
Yeah.

698
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:25,809
rted?

699
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,409
Unfortunately, try to remove your superhero.

700
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,810
Can you keep a secret?

701
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:32,200
- Not really.
- ri si.

702
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,202
Well, listen to D. It's never a word for anyone, okay?

703
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:37,401
- Come on.
- But what?

704
00:49:37,402 --> 00:49:39,951
?S and if we care about someone?

705
00:49:42,202 --> 00:49:44,701
The players do not get out of each other.

706
00:49:44,801 --> 00:49:46,385
I'm .n j  tes .

707
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:46,794
Yes you are.

708
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:48,635
Do you know that you can do some better?

709
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:50,385
If you do it fast with the handle.

710
00:49:50,585 --> 00:49:51,885
- J   jt.
- J   jt.

711
00:49:52,085 --> 00:49:53,636
- Hello.
- Let's meet in the morning.

712
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:54,336
Sleep.

713
00:50:00,136 --> 00:50:01,977
What time can I help you?

714
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:03,477
Sir, please.

715
00:50:04,476 --> 00:50:05,726
No, he can't go in there.

716
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:07,277
He's gone, but he can't go.

717
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,159
Sorry about this.

718
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,660
H t, this is a management meeting.

719
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,409
Yes, I know, Dad.

720
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,659
That evening ...

721
00:50:25,412 --> 00:50:26,659
In the car.

722
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:30,409
I told you I saw something, but didn't believe me.

723
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:33,110
It was easier for me to blame the accident.

724
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:33,910
True?

725
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,161
If you don't miss your attention then

726
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:38,661
you can see.

727
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,911
Now I'm sure.

728
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,411
Stop it, Thad.

729
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:47,435
Do you want to?

730
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:49,577
Dear Sid.

731
00:50:51,275 --> 00:50:53,276
He has always been with me.

732
00:50:54,025 --> 00:50:56,027
- Even before the accident.
- Don't make it easy

733
00:50:56,218 --> 00:50:57,777
to get out of here.

734
00:50:58,118 --> 00:51:00,369
Needless to sort out the scene.

735
00:51:00,569 --> 00:51:02,460
  , tes . The scene.

736
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,961
Just now.

737
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:09,461
Tell me if you can throw the bullet?

738
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:10,309
We?

739
00:51:10,411 --> 00:51:13,460
Tell me if you are so much a guy that you can throw me away?

740
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:19,801
I'll put it on instead.

741
00:51:23,802 --> 00:51:24,644
  , God!

742
00:51:27,735 --> 00:51:30,486
They are not out of sight.

743
00:51:32,986 --> 00:51:35,986
I want to make love to celebrate.

744
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:37,077
by

745
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:42,826

746
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:40,719
Risto!

747
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,609
Not!

Segtsg!

751
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:08,244
I don't like you whining whimpering.

752
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:13,585
Which one is best for you?

753
00:53:13,835 --> 00:53:16,586
You can get me a thing. Pnzt.

754
00:53:16,786 --> 00:53:19,085
Or the c get.
You want the c?

755
00:53:19,885 --> 00:53:21,085
He's got it.

756
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:24,177
Fsvnysg.

757
00:53:24,336 --> 00:53:28,518
You seriously think that pznz,

758
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:31,019
that is all you have,

759
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:34,769
does that mean power?

760
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,769
This is power.

761
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:43,518
You don't have that much power.

762
00:53:44,258 --> 00:53:46,202
S t, nobody is.

763
00:53:47,451 --> 00:53:50,200
Someone has more power.

764
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:54,702
He found the champion.

765
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,700
You have to make sure you have the power before you

766
00:54:01,735 --> 00:54:03,701
  s and beat.

767
00:54:03,735 --> 00:54:05,976
Show me where he is.

768
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:22,568
Yeah, f sv ny.

769
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:25,660
It can be yours.

770
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:27,411
You.

771
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:35,251
No. No, no!

772
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,686
Your fraud is much more than one.

773
00:54:57,435 --> 00:54:59,184
Sivana Industriesn l

774
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:01,526
the cheat is the first.

775
00:55:02,027 --> 00:55:02,726
Your family.

776
00:55:25,776 --> 00:55:27,052
  , Birk.

777
00:55:29,552 --> 00:55:31,302
Where's the car?

778
00:55:39,802 --> 00:55:41,302
I hear.

779
00:55:52,052 --> 00:55:54,577
It can not be.
My car ...

780
00:55:58,077 --> 00:55:59,418
H t, sr cok ​​...

781
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:01,668
This is not brought down by pol r.

782
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:14,168
You leave the dirty work for the misery, br v .

783
00:56:14,368 --> 00:56:16,277
I pay attention to the terrain, I give the unaware.

784
00:56:16,302 --> 00:56:17,602
Don't you go?

785
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:22,101
The problem is that you always have to find something wrong.

786
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:24,601
- What's wrong with this?
- Yes.

787
00:56:31,852 --> 00:56:33,101
Do you have permissions?

788
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,627
Yeah, don't we? Yes. Always.

789
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,127
You.

790
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:42,627
You're doing something wrong.

791
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:44,876
n? Bad? No never.

792
00:56:45,076 --> 00:56:46,126
I am not like that.

793
00:56:46,326 --> 00:56:48,219
Our ap nk j n  rt nk, but ksik.

00:56:51,718 --> 00:56:52,810
In the office office?

796
00:56:53,311 --> 00:56:54,310
Of course.

Well, hi, son.

804
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:15,651
I'm sorry, kemstem, they got up in the office.

805
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:20,336
Because of labor.
This is the key to security

806
00:57:20,536 --> 00:57:22,335
who are so suckled by children?

807

00:57:24,686 --> 00:57:25,334
it's an eye.

809
00:57:25,534 --> 00:57:29,977
Don't be bothered. Sir, sir
I'll thoroughly sneak the boy.

810
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:32,426
Anyway, I'm here, you see,

00:59:05,185 --> 00:59:06,686
I'm very sorry.

826
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:09,026
Fire Immunization.

827
00:59:29,962 --> 00:59:31,709
Stronger than gas engine.

828
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:33,959
Gzmozdony? What are you, an old man?

829
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,960
With a momentum, the roof is popping up.

830
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:42,760
With a boost.

831
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:48,043
Sorry, sorry, sorry, people.

832
00:59:49,393 --> 00:59:52,985
Tel  t lt. Tel  added.
Tel  added.

833
00:59:53,185 --> 00:59:56,236
You know what? There is something to say,
what you throw ...

834
00:59:56,336 --> 00:59:58,326
- all men  akci n l.
- I remembered it.

835
00:59:58,426 --> 00:59:59,801
Listen, listen, how do you like it?

836
00:59:59,826 --> 01:00:01,827
"Do not put this on your body."

837
01:00:02,326 --> 01:00:05,075
It is true that your strength is not one of your superstars.

838
01:00:05,325 --> 01:00:05,827
Tel  added.

839
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:08,286
- Do you have better dum?
- What the hell ...

840
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:11,168
And then it is bright.

841
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,913
How do you do this?  , anyway.

842
01:00:38,286 --> 01:00:39,865
What is it? What is it?
Cscsket?

843
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:40,635
Bimbou too?

844
01:00:41,035 --> 01:00:42,285
What do you say nothing?

845
01:00:43,034 --> 01:00:46,284
- There's a lot to do here.
- What? Or for 5 minutes.

846
01:00:46,386 --> 01:00:47,826
Because they are fed.

847
01:00:56,539 --> 01:00:57,468
Let's go.

848
01:01:00,718 --> 01:01:03,560
- Come here.
- Don't do it!

849
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:09,811
I don't have to see it.
I don't have to see it.

850
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:12,651
Kamp. Kivgeztelek.

851
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:15,401
INGATLANKZVETT

852
01:01:16,701 --> 01:01:18,151
Hide-out?

853
01:01:18,652 --> 01:01:22,151
Yes. We will then keep the business secret.

854
01:01:23,051 --> 01:01:23,751
Can clearly.

855
01:01:24,243 --> 01:01:26,744
And if there is a real estate on sale on a rock ...

856
01:01:26,993 --> 01:01:28,585
you know, with a box.

857
01:01:28,693 --> 01:01:29,944
She's looking at the sea.

858
01:01:30,044 --> 01:01:32,283
Yes, we'll always see how the pits are poking.

859
01:01:32,284 --> 01:01:33,835
- You know?
- Be cool too.

860
01:01:34,035 --> 01:01:35,836
V zes s, tutira, yes. Nan.

861
01:01:36,084 --> 01:01:38,676
See, Maximum Stretch Out.

862
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:40,085
Leave it to Max.

863
01:01:41,086 --> 01:01:44,585
Do you, Maxi, start by wanting a cool room?

864
01:01:44,685 --> 01:01:45,645
- One.
- About h ...

865
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:46,768
- One?
- What's up?

866
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:49,019
I don't want a kids' home on the rock.

867
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:02,610
Did you see when you hit the ball?

868
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,310
Men.

869
01:02:03,311 --> 01:02:05,452
I'm the one who always takes video?

870
01:02:05,652 --> 01:02:07,452
You also need a big house.

871
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,705
- What? To pick?
- Yes.

872
01:02:09,805 --> 01:02:11,453
S ,t, maybe even bigger bodybuilders.

873
01:02:11,454 --> 01:02:13,000
Keep the camera?

874
01:02:13,452 --> 01:02:15,452
Take a look at the loss.

875
01:02:15,953 --> 01:02:17,847
Like a fan of whites.

876
01:02:18,793 --> 01:02:19,886
H , Freeman.

877
01:02:20,387 --> 01:02:21,885
You're gonna fuck this up.

878
01:02:22,134 --> 01:02:24,636
The best barid to add a wheelchair?

879
01:02:24,686 --> 01:02:27,284
Not sure  .
But there is another beast.

880
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,725
Whoever is hanging out. And killed you.

881
01:02:29,385 --> 01:02:31,385
- Relax, Freddy.
- Tal n, you heard it.

882
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:34,227
A Total T lt .
Frequency Phantom,

883
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:35,726
Izg-vibrating.

884
01:02:36,027 --> 01:02:37,570
Yes. There are many names.

885
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,068
Do you know V r s Vill mot?

886
01:02:39,168 --> 01:02:43,318
- You? You think he's gonna take this thing?
- It's better than you think.

887
01:02:43,818 --> 01:02:45,518
Also at this moment.

888
01:02:45,818 --> 01:02:48,069
- Prove it!
- I will, tomorrow.

889
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:50,818
Tomorrow, he's gonna jump into eb d, ...s ... it's Billy?

890
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:54,252
Yeah, Superman will bring the dessert, right?

891
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,001
Tomorrow, eb dn l, then you will find it.

892
01:02:59,201 --> 01:03:02,501
And if it doesn't show up, it'll be for you.

893
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:07,093
We said that you can't tell who I am

894
01:03:07,543 --> 01:03:08,592
not to let anyone go.

895
01:03:09,135 --> 01:03:12,194
You can blink if you can blink because it is okay.

896
01:03:12,294 --> 01:03:15,092
Billy, these aren't supergonists, just superb.

897
01:03:15,843 --> 01:03:17,843
Are you breaking your rules?

898
01:03:18,342 --> 01:03:18,935
Well, okay.

899
01:03:19,935 --> 01:03:22,685
We are both equally involved in this.

900
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:25,827
You're just thinking about yourself.

901
01:03:26,026 --> 01:03:28,119
Billy, but what about you?

902
01:03:28,368 --> 01:03:30,868
What would you do then?

903
01:03:32,368 --> 01:03:33,618
Let's see your hands.

904
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:38,869
I'll give the family a cool.

905
01:03:39,118 --> 01:03:41,359
Today's Day. And I'll give you a warmth.

906
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:43,801
Sorry, Billy's hand is free.

907
01:03:47,051 --> 01:03:50,301
There is a great hurry in Philadelphia.
A superhero came up.

908
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,142
  s pre-harvest.

909
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:53,644
Nade, right?

910
01:03:54,392 --> 01:03:57,143
  , please? Explain it.

911
01:03:57,343 --> 01:03:59,736
Share your deal, Eugene.

912
01:04:00,986 --> 01:04:03,736
What do you do?
Have you put up tents?

913
01:04:03,836 --> 01:04:06,984
Well s? I also put the plot on top of it.

914
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:07,985
Bravo.

915
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:09,185
Pedro.

916
01:04:09,735 --> 01:04:10,485
Vlemny?

917
01:04:10,826 --> 01:04:12,326
The cushion is.

918
01:04:13,476 --> 01:04:14,526
- And ...
- All right.

919
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,825
And it's like a wedding party.

920
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:20,575
   And if you did not   chose the editor, do you not think of it?

921
01:04:21,326 --> 01:04:23,326
You're the specialist Freddy, do you think?

922
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,760
Freddy, then ... try to be positive.

923
01:04:27,011 --> 01:04:31,511
J. I guess it wasn't exactly what he got before.

924
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:33,260
This is also the case.
All right.

925
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,010
You're sure to be cool, but I'll be able to jump everybody's neck.

926
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,800
You do not say? Nah t, that's nice.

927
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:42,601
rted. It is important for a superhero to retire.

928
01:04:42,801 --> 01:04:45,853
If he retires, it means he doesn't want to be with his family.

929
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:48,036
Seriously, now we're frustrated?

930
01:04:48,236 --> 01:04:50,284
The superhero syndrome is typical.

931
01:04:50,484 --> 01:04:54,285
Yes, a psychologist, Henrich von
some nv nvv

932
01:04:54,385 --> 01:04:56,885
he has set the superer as the drug.

933
01:04:58,785 --> 01:05:00,285
Billy, son, let's have dinner.

934
01:05:00,485 --> 01:05:04,035
- You have to help him.
- Tell me about a menu.

935
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:07,468
Darla, it's very strange that you are so quiet.

936
01:05:07,668 --> 01:05:10,718
- You always chuckle.
- Because I eat.

937
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:23,401
What's up in school?

938
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:26,401
You can't see him every day.

939
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:27,401
You're not sure.

940
01:05:28,151 --> 01:05:29,901
But I'm older.

941
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:34,493
But I'm also going with you, we just have to give something to  r.

942
01:05:34,693 --> 01:05:35,992
Billy, now where are you doing?

943
01:05:36,192 --> 01:05:37,993
But let's do the same thing, right?

944
01:05:38,743 --> 01:05:42,994
Billy, Electric, Le , you're gonna go with me on the menu, right?

945
01:05:45,493 --> 01:05:45,994
Oh no!

946
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:53,993
Royal.

947
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:55,743
Very tender.

948
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,243
Usually they give me a little bit of money.

949
01:05:59,243 --> 01:06:01,994
But ... you are cute.
Be right.

950
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:16,243
- Jesus.
- Mary, all right?

951
01:06:16,443 --> 01:06:18,492
- Didn't you mind?
- How do you know my name?

952
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,193
How do I know?

953
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:23,243
Think, this is one of my superers.

954
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:25,702
What sounds like that before.

955
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:28,951
It's not as cool as the crap or the bivalyer.

956
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:30,636
But useful when I get to know you.

957
01:06:31,636 --> 01:06:32,385
Megsrltl?

958
01:06:32,885 --> 01:06:34,886
No, I'm from there.

959
01:06:35,086 --> 01:06:36,135
Thank you.

960
01:06:37,636 --> 01:06:39,636
Oh, I just have to think.

961
01:06:41,136 --> 01:06:43,287
I have a very strange day.

962
01:06:43,385 --> 01:06:47,135
But, using ... my super observer

963
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:49,385
I'll see you received a letter from the university.

964
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:53,136
Are you so frustrated because you haven't picked up?

965
01:06:56,635 --> 01:06:57,911
They recorded.

966
01:07:00,661 --> 01:07:02,663
Then he left the superer m,

967
01:07:02,863 --> 01:07:04,660
  and I did not really say this.

968
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:05,890
H t,  n neither.

969
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:11,041
Suddenly I don't know if I want to, because this is mlmom,

970
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:12,843
And I worked hard on her.

971
01:07:13,843 --> 01:07:15,094
But in the ...

972
01:07:17,543 --> 01:07:20,186
It's so hard because I don't want to leave my family.

973
01:07:20,386 --> 01:07:22,936
Listen, listen. Let me give you a lesson.

974
01:07:23,436 --> 01:07:25,186
These things do not matter to the others.

975
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:27,184
You're always the first.

976
01:07:27,384 --> 01:07:29,937
- That's what Gandhi said.
- I don't think he said that.

977
01:07:30,137 --> 01:07:31,435
- But, tutira.
- Disabled ...

978
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:34,167
Then someone who is like him.

979
01:07:34,168 --> 01:07:35,325
,S very much, Yoda might have been.

980
01:07:35,326 --> 01:07:37,043
- Pay attention.
- Sorry, but certainly not.

981
01:07:37,068 --> 01:07:39,918
We do not lose it, but the thing is to think about yourself.

982
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:41,625
You have yours.

983
01:07:41,626 --> 01:07:43,969
And you need to get further away from here.

984
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,961
- I don't want to get stuck.
- You want to.

985
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:51,210
Do you want to go to school with a child?

986
01:07:52,461 --> 01:07:55,302
You listen. Your fraud is for those who can't do it alone.

987
01:07:55,502 --> 01:07:56,551
rted?

988
01:07:57,002 --> 01:07:58,551
You're good-looking. Well, that's it.

989
01:07:58,651 --> 01:08:01,301
Always look before you go to .ttesten.

990
01:08:06,802 --> 01:08:08,552
Then I wake up to be sure.

991
01:08:11,802 --> 01:08:13,552
He's ringing. Ring.

992
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:17,552
Var zs Vill m? Cs!
Where are you?

993
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:21,553
H , but rough. Here's Freddy.
H t, this is nothing, this is rlet.

994
01:08:23,552 --> 01:08:25,801
He's not talking to anyone.

995
01:08:27,302 --> 01:08:28,918
But yes. I talked to him.

996
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:30,968
We're friends. I know. Tnyleg.

997
01:08:31,468 --> 01:08:33,069
I know because ...

998
01:08:36,267 --> 01:08:37,010
Damn it.

999
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,360
Well, come on.

1000
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:45,352
IFN. Villmfny.

1001
01:08:46,351 --> 01:08:47,602
IFN. Villmfny.

1002
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,550
Villmfny.

1003
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,601
- H !
- H !

1004
01:08:52,801 --> 01:08:54,852
As a young man. Well, na, na, na.

1005
01:08:55,052 --> 01:08:56,332
You see, I'm holding a program?

1006
01:08:56,392 --> 01:08:57,592
How can I help you?

1007
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:00,193
I just want to ask you if I have a problem.

1008
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:03,343
The situation is that I have a little bit of light on my body.

1009
01:09:03,543 --> 01:09:05,034
I'll tell you what.

1010
01:09:05,335 --> 01:09:07,785
It's because they were raised from als gaty mn , .s

1011
01:09:07,985 --> 01:09:09,876
they walked up the river.

1012
01:09:11,126 --> 01:09:12,877
And that was my subdivision.

1013
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:17,026
Undi.

1014
01:09:17,226 --> 01:09:19,877
- You said you'd be there.
- You said I'll be there.

1015
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:22,468
Nemn not ...
I'm superhero, tes .

1016
01:09:22,668 --> 01:09:23,967
Beef traces you.

1017
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:26,060
How much did you get today?

1018
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,310
Look, Freddy! This is  ri si responsible,  rted?

1019
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:31,811
But nothing, I'll get you off, so.

1020
01:10:00,809 --> 01:10:01,811
H , but rough.

1021
01:10:04,059 --> 01:10:06,311
Don't move! Nobody moves!

1022
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:16,061
Oh no...

1023
01:10:16,561 --> 01:10:19,060
No, no, no. Stay! Stay!

1024
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,111
Stay there!

1025
01:10:29,611 --> 01:10:31,294
A , that's sure.

1026
01:10:31,543 --> 01:10:34,294
   that. That superhero son.

1027
01:10:35,544 --> 01:10:36,796
Save us!

1028
01:10:37,293 --> 01:10:38,294
Come on!

1029
01:10:40,794 --> 01:10:42,343
Come on. Yes.

1030
01:11:03,068 --> 01:11:03,911
Oh no.

1031
01:11:04,111 --> 01:11:05,410
Don't do this to me.

1032
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:07,409
I'm afraid it's going to be bad.

1033
01:11:17,661 --> 01:11:22,250
Huh. Sikerlt. Sikerlt!
I got the bus!

1034
01:11:22,251 --> 01:11:24,701
Nothing p nik! Just don't move.

1035
01:11:25,001 --> 01:11:27,752
Well, now I'll just put it down somehow.

1036
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:36,250
Go. Sicc.

1037
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,752
They're gentle, they're a dog.
It's a dog.

1038
01:11:38,952 --> 01:11:40,252
You're a very bad dog.

1039
01:11:40,452 --> 01:11:41,851
Tns. Go mr.

1040
01:11:42,501 --> 01:11:44,000
Come on.

1041
01:11:45,776 --> 01:11:47,026
K ,szi, kszi.

1042
01:11:47,776 --> 01:11:48,776
Kszcsi.

1043
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,552
- Are you a superhero?
- And.

1044
01:12:05,752 --> 01:12:09,751
Oh, no, no, no. I just saw it on the outside, just like ...

1045
01:12:09,752 --> 01:12:11,142
- K sz n m.
- No problem.

1046
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:13,393
I'm just a mistake.

1047
01:12:15,944 --> 01:12:19,394
It seems that Philadelphia received early Kar csonyi.

1048
01:12:19,594 --> 01:12:22,394
M ghozz  is a sympathetic superhero.

1049
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:24,735
  s, that's it.

1050
01:12:25,135 --> 01:12:27,161
- Great. Very nice.
- Very tender.

1051
01:12:27,186 --> 01:12:29,325
Dude. Dude. Have you seen this?

1052
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:33,075
Yes. He picked up a bus.
And almost everyone died.

1053
01:12:33,275 --> 01:12:34,577
But I got it!

1054
01:12:35,326 --> 01:12:38,325
Freddy, did I just get a bus, just?

1055
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,827
It was like a smooth baseball ball.

1056
01:12:41,027 --> 01:12:42,576
Who knows what? Only  n.

1057
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:46,576
You're not doing anything, just taking pictures, and scaring.

1058
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:49,826
Anyway, let's, ysgysem can't talk to you at this time.

1059
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:52,010
I think you are envious.

1060
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,509
M g ye. BRV. We can also do this.

1061
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:01,002
I do well, too, t kmindegy, s t ciki ...

1062
01:13:01,202 --> 01:13:03,194
Because I'm not gonna buy me.

1063
01:13:03,443 --> 01:13:05,194
No more than sorry.

1064
01:13:05,692 --> 01:13:06,943
Yes. See rm. See rm.

1065
01:13:07,143 --> 01:13:08,193
Have you seen it?

1066
01:13:08,393 --> 01:13:09,944
It's like being indestructible.

1067
01:13:10,693 --> 01:13:12,243
They're not gonna get it.

1068
01:13:13,036 --> 01:13:14,443
And now you're not.

1069
01:13:15,285 --> 01:13:17,285
Do you consider yourself superhero?

1070
01:13:17,785 --> 01:13:21,625
Do you know that you are 14? And you're not better than Brian teskn l.

1071
01:13:21,876 --> 01:13:26,125
You're superb, just play your brain, and try yourself more.

1072
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:31,718
Not nice.
I do what I want!

1073
01:13:33,219 --> 01:13:35,811
And I think I'm at least 25 yrs!

1074
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,560
S t, may be 30.

1075
01:13:42,061 --> 01:13:43,351
Adjust selected!

1076
01:13:47,151 --> 01:13:48,652
You're the perfect man.

1077
01:13:50,654 --> 01:13:51,900
It's clear.

1078
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,650
Absolutely flawless.

1079
01:13:57,401 --> 01:14:00,153
- Because you raised it?
- Sorry, can I help you?

1080
01:14:00,585 --> 01:14:02,835
What does he want? .
Give me an autograph?

1081
01:14:03,035 --> 01:14:04,539
Add your strength.

1082
01:14:06,835 --> 01:14:08,085
Or you die.

1083
01:14:08,334 --> 01:14:12,335
Bakker. You're bad, right? Emrtem m r,  rtem.

1084
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:17,175
Watch out before you get yourself into trouble, just wanna make a good fit ...

1085
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:28,361
The weapon of the mortals is against us.

1086
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,859
The vultures cannot be bypassed.

1087
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:35,360
Just a lullaby.

1088
01:14:36,201 --> 01:14:38,451
Time to give me your strength.

1089
01:14:40,544 --> 01:14:44,293
. Huh. Oh, no, what?

1090
01:14:44,493 --> 01:14:46,951
High Fater.
This is gangsta style.

1091
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:57,952
Ok. Ok. Sorry.

1092
01:14:59,452 --> 01:15:01,476
It was almost nonsense to snort.

1093
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:03,226
I didn't want to complain.

1094
01:15:03,326 --> 01:15:05,444
- Let's talk, huh?
- Childish reaction.

1095
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:07,169
It's because I'm a kid.
Don't be too bad.

1096
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:08,918
You just don't mind a kid, right?

1097
01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:15,911
Yes, I can fly! Yes, I can fly!

1098
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,811
Freddy said I had to believe

1099
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:19,160
And then I'm going to fly.

1100
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,659
I believe it! I believe it !.

1101
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:23,818
Superman. Superman. What is not working? I want to fly!

1102
01:15:24,218 --> 01:15:24,851
I want to fly!

1103
01:15:25,051 --> 01:15:26,751
I do not want to die!

1104
01:15:49,752 --> 01:15:50,802
It's floating!

1105
01:16:00,768 --> 01:16:02,448
- Where did he fall?
- What about him?

1106
01:16:04,118 --> 01:16:05,462
I can fly!

1107
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,460
Billy?

1108
01:16:13,551 --> 01:16:16,050
Freddy, you need help!

1109
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,553
Can you fly?

1110
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:26,393
Who is that guy with you?

1111
01:16:26,593 --> 01:16:28,393
Tlapa!

1112
01:16:28,593 --> 01:16:29,642
Hohoho.

1113
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:34,886
Tell me what you are doing with T lanya?

1114
01:16:35,535 --> 01:16:39,486
Hunkt ... we're about to vacate at D li.

1115
01:16:44,735 --> 01:16:47,235
Segtsg! Segtsg!

1116
01:16:47,435 --> 01:16:49,418
Top in trouble!

1117
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,168
Somebody help me!

1118
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:52,417
Get it if I can help you.

1119
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:02,168
Excuse me, we're just a little bit lame here if it's not wrong.

1120
01:17:05,169 --> 01:17:06,668
Gee. This is yours.

1121
01:17:07,158 --> 01:17:09,103
Clean  r let. You don't have to bother with it.

1122
01:17:09,303 --> 01:17:11,250
It's not your business.
Can you slow down?

1123
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:13,243
Yes. You'll be down there.

1124
01:17:21,843 --> 01:17:22,486
Tns!

1125
01:17:26,335 --> 01:17:28,626
- I'm Batman.
- Get it, Batman.

1126
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:00,651
Replj!

1127
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:27,401
Sha, Sha, Sha, Shazam!

1128
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:00,901
Billy?

1129
01:19:02,101 --> 01:19:03,385
Billy, where are you?

1130
01:19:06,885 --> 01:19:07,976
Billy?

1131
01:19:08,976 --> 01:19:10,226
Where are you, buddy?

1132
01:19:14,976 --> 01:19:16,225
Billy, don't do it!

1133
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:20,569
Tell me.

1134
01:19:21,018 --> 01:19:22,118
Where is?

1135
01:19:22,218 --> 01:19:23,267
I do not know.

1136
01:19:24,068 --> 01:19:25,819
Great Evil! Great Evil!

1137
01:19:27,219 --> 01:19:28,168
Worse!

1138
01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:29,911
Much worse.

1139
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:33,410
Radioactive Atomic Radiation?
Telemagnetic Energy Manipulator?

1140
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:36,411
Don't go into my brain!
My brain is off.

1141
01:19:36,511 --> 01:19:39,010
- You can't get it.
- I don't have to get involved.

1142
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,159
Because you will tell.

1143
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:43,093
Where is?

1144
01:19:55,686 --> 01:19:57,185
You ,g,  desem!

1145
01:19:58,185 --> 01:19:59,835
What is it? Are you right?

1146
01:20:00,026 --> 01:20:01,776
Sure? Don't you care?

1147
01:20:01,976 --> 01:20:03,776
- Let's go.
- We need to talk.

1148
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:06,868
Don't be strict.

1149
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:15,710
Lied to us! Eltntl.

1150
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:18,710
Then they got out of school to barely get in. You're going to get involved.

1151
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:24,052
<i> This is my son. </i>

1152
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:26,551
<I> Mirt? "Rescued 9 people. </i>"

1153
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:28,960
Come on, Freddy?

1154
01:20:29,552 --> 01:20:31,085
<i> Would you know what to do? </i>

1155
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,310
How's Freddy with a superhero?

1156
01:20:33,643 --> 01:20:35,892
<i> - Take it back.
-  , right? </i>

1157
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:39,893
How about a superhero with Freddy?

1158
01:20:43,235 --> 01:20:47,035
They came when Freddy  s Billy
So they argued about dinner,

1159
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:49,235
as a time-lapse?
Exactly like.

1160
01:20:50,235 --> 01:20:52,885
When he saved, he knew almost everything.

1161
01:20:52,985 --> 01:20:54,835
He knew my name, Mary.

1162
01:21:03,236 --> 01:21:04,485
Please contact us.

1163
01:21:04,685 --> 01:21:06,985
You mean Billy is Ampermen?

1164
01:21:07,185 --> 01:21:08,985
ljen! You turned to.

1165
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:10,510
And I didn't help.

1166
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:12,509
- I can keep a secret.
- You knew it?

1167
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,011
I'm a ye!

1168
01:21:18,851 --> 01:21:20,351
How did you think?

1169
01:21:21,194 --> 01:21:22,694
You've also covered Freddy.

1170
01:21:29,193 --> 01:21:32,285
Let's leave, kids.
Isn't that right, okay?

1171
01:21:42,035 --> 01:21:42,876
Billy.

1172
01:21:48,218 --> 01:21:51,719
You are that.
You're the superhero.

1173
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:55,560
  n only, I was. No, no.

1174
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:02,061
What is my mother-in-law?

1175
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,060
Eugene continued the search.

1176
01:22:07,059 --> 01:22:08,901
Listen, I'm not a hacker, relax.

1177
01:22:09,101 --> 01:22:11,902
But I played What's Lock,  s AppLink.

1178
01:22:12,102 --> 01:22:13,994
Ams and I may have learned a bit,

1179
01:22:14,194 --> 01:22:17,742
I can also access databases where others are not.

1180
01:22:18,243 --> 01:22:19,871
Yeah, I have to go now.

1181
01:22:20,071 --> 01:22:22,835
Your name is Marilyn  s C.C. Batson.

1182
01:22:28,586 --> 01:22:29,089
We?

1183
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:31,177
He was born in Zumbrot , Minnesota.

1184
01:22:31,377 --> 01:22:33,427
3 of them when they were gone.

1185
01:22:33,627 --> 01:22:35,425
Your mom used it here.

1186
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:37,427
Otherwise, you lose more.

1187
01:22:37,676 --> 01:22:39,267
You did not find the papad because it was

1188
01:22:39,268 --> 01:22:41,767
10  v  en in a Florida home.

1189
01:22:41,967 --> 01:22:43,218
Your mom ...

1190
01:22:45,268 --> 01:22:46,360
We?

1191
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:48,860
Dead?

1192
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:51,360
He lives here a bit.

1193
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:53,201
We?

1194
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,952
You didn't find it because you took back your old name.

1195
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:02,993
H , Billy!

1196
01:23:03,393 --> 01:23:04,043
Billy!

1197
01:23:08,043 --> 01:23:09,793
- The key, Viktor.
- Here.

1198
01:23:09,893 --> 01:23:11,443
You stay at home, h tha come back.

1199
01:23:11,643 --> 01:23:13,924
<i> I ARE INCREASING. WHAT IS YOUR SUPERIORITY? </i>

1200
01:23:18,475 --> 01:23:19,226
Well, come on.

1201
01:23:19,426 --> 01:23:20,976
Let's go in, come on.

1202
01:23:29,568 --> 01:23:32,317
Not! I thought we were going to Billy.

1203
01:23:32,568 --> 01:23:34,819
No. We are still staying at home.

1204
01:23:38,567 --> 01:23:39,660
Billy!

1205
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:44,251
Freddy.

1206
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:49,751
   How cozy.

1207
01:23:53,401 --> 01:23:55,101
This will be undone again.

1208
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:58,751
It's a leper plant.

1209
01:24:41,802 --> 01:24:43,001
A moment.

1210
01:24:47,752 --> 01:24:49,985
Oh, no, let's not. That's how I work out.

1211
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,085
We don't need filter sheets, please.

1212
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:53,585
- Go ahead.
- Oh, no ...

1213
01:24:54,485 --> 01:24:56,485
You probably don't know it, but ...

1214
01:24:58,735 --> 01:24:59,985
House was.

1215
01:25:01,326 --> 01:25:02,235
Maternal...

1216
01:25:03,836 --> 01:25:05,236
I'm the one.

1217
01:25:06,168 --> 01:25:07,417
Oh, my God.

1218
01:25:09,418 --> 01:25:10,418
You are.

1219
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:13,969
Vrj.

1220
01:25:14,168 --> 01:25:15,168
This is now...

1221
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:17,668
<i> Who is it? Who's there? </i>

1222
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:21,668
Hey, nobody, Travis.

1223
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:29,352
That's not Dad's in, right?

1224
01:25:30,351 --> 01:25:30,952
No, but ...

1225
01:25:32,601 --> 01:25:33,893
Szval

1226
01:25:36,993 --> 01:25:38,194
Are you just that?

1227
01:25:40,693 --> 01:25:42,194
Believe me, I didn't want to disappear.

1228
01:25:42,943 --> 01:25:44,493
You know.

1229
01:25:45,194 --> 01:25:46,943
I've let go of your hand, and then ...

1230
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:49,694
- I was somehow confused.
- I know. Of course.

1231
01:25:50,926 --> 01:25:51,727
Lttalak.

1232
01:25:53,376 --> 01:25:54,126
We?

1233
01:25:57,126 --> 01:25:58,876
I've got a little more.

1234
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:04,376
Wow, you can't do anything.

1235
01:26:05,868 --> 01:26:08,060
Billy, I was 17 years old.

1236
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:10,310
His father left.

1237
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:14,810
And nothing ... wasn't willing to help.

1238
01:26:15,401 --> 01:26:18,151
Very weary, and I was in bad pass.

1239
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:23,492
- But I want the tiger.
- I know. I know, sir.

1240
01:26:24,493 --> 01:26:26,495
But mommy doesn't like her as you see it?

1241
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:30,335
Billy?

1242
01:26:31,585 --> 01:26:32,336
Billy!

1243
01:26:33,585 --> 01:26:34,335
Billy!

1244
01:26:35,085 --> 01:26:37,335
Jesus. Billy! This is not funny.

1245
01:26:37,835 --> 01:26:39,175
Tess k, cimbi.

1246
01:26:45,175 --> 01:26:46,926
When I came across the police,

1247
01:26:48,426 --> 01:26:49,669
abruptly,

1248
01:26:50,268 --> 01:26:53,268
that they will care much better than  n.

1249
01:26:58,769 --> 01:27:00,111
But you are, right?

1250
01:27:01,861 --> 01:27:03,610
Do you have a good life?

1251
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:06,701
Because you look very cool.

1252
01:27:09,451 --> 01:27:10,301
Just...

1253
01:27:12,451 --> 01:27:15,650
Not at the best time, Billy.

1254
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:21,636
I would have liked it...

1255
01:27:23,386 --> 01:27:25,384
if you know everything is fine.

1256
01:27:26,886 --> 01:27:29,135
I'm going back to my real family.

1257
01:27:31,477 --> 01:27:32,726
Here it is.

1258
01:27:36,568 --> 01:27:37,088
What is this?

1259
01:27:38,318 --> 01:27:39,818
<i> Marilyn, what's going on? </i>

1260
01:27:41,069 --> 01:27:43,318
He's got a bigger need.

1261
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:02,568
Freddy, you were right.

1262
01:28:02,717 --> 01:28:05,567
- Sorry to shout.
<i> - Come home, Billy. </i>

1263
01:28:06,093 --> 01:28:07,094
<I> Hurry! </ I>

1264
01:28:07,294 --> 01:28:08,343
Billy!

1265
01:28:08,443 --> 01:28:10,094
Great Evil! Great Evil!

1266
01:28:42,394 --> 01:28:43,093
Who are you?

1267
01:28:43,593 --> 01:28:44,593
  s what do you want?

1268
01:28:44,793 --> 01:28:46,093
What do I want?

1269
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:47,501
I said.

1270
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,051
This.

1271
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:01,486
Give her, Billy!

1272
01:29:05,485 --> 01:29:06,685
On, Billy.

1273
01:29:06,686 --> 01:29:08,236
At least try it.

1274
01:29:08,436 --> 01:29:10,635
If you let them go, I'll go in.

1275
01:29:11,485 --> 01:29:12,985
No, come first.

1276
01:29:13,185 --> 01:29:14,985
I'll let them go.

1277
01:29:31,986 --> 01:29:32,985
J  fi .

1278
01:29:35,785 --> 01:29:37,234
Because you are, right?

1279
01:29:38,535 --> 01:29:39,835
Are you cool?

1280
01:29:40,101 --> 01:29:41,851
Almost 15.

1281
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:42,603
Hm.

1282
01:29:44,102 --> 01:29:45,693
When I was a child,

1283
01:29:45,893 --> 01:29:47,944
ap m didn't hold ahead.

1284
01:29:48,442 --> 01:29:51,194
But you are my son, you are.

1285
01:29:52,193 --> 01:29:53,835
You're going to go before me.

1286
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:56,786
.S and before.
You are not h s.

1287
01:29:57,034 --> 01:29:59,286
But now you get a chance to get that.

1288
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:02,377
Give me the champion power.

1289
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:03,875
Don't do it, Billy!

1290
01:30:20,376 --> 01:30:21,878
Add your strength, and don't worry.

1291
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:26,176
No, no. Don't do it, Billy.

1292
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:27,227
Do not go away.

1293
01:30:27,851 --> 01:30:30,310
- Don't go, Billy.
- But do it.

1294
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:32,810
So push one of them.

1295
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:34,310
True?

1296
01:30:38,839 --> 01:30:39,935
Billy.

1297
01:31:06,385 --> 01:31:08,961
I did everything to get here.

1298
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:11,360
I searched for nothing.

1299
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:13,361
Nobody believed me.

1300
01:31:14,201 --> 01:31:15,951
- No more.
- No one helped.

1301
01:31:16,452 --> 01:31:17,702
It's not ...

1302
01:31:19,102 --> 01:31:20,451
It's not my family.

1303
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:23,793
I could only do it myself.

1304
01:31:25,044 --> 01:31:25,743
rtem.

1305
01:31:27,243 --> 01:31:28,793
I know what it is.

1306
01:31:30,294 --> 01:31:32,544
It's like being alone in the world.

1307
01:31:32,744 --> 01:31:33,386
Get up!

1308
01:31:33,586 --> 01:31:36,636
Has if you had one thing to find it?

1309
01:31:36,836 --> 01:31:38,135
Then you are ahead.

1310
01:31:38,335 --> 01:31:39,727
Get up!

1311
01:31:42,526 --> 01:31:43,976
What's the champion's name?

1312
01:31:45,727 --> 01:31:46,725
Say it!

1313
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:17,977
Pay attention. Sorry I'm gonna go in, but I don't think they want you.

1314
01:32:18,727 --> 01:32:21,027
Don't listen to your peers.

1315
01:32:22,226 --> 01:32:24,226
Grab the stick.

1316
01:32:24,426 --> 01:32:25,934
Take it.

1317
01:32:26,134 --> 01:32:28,935
And tell the champion name.

1318
01:32:29,525 --> 01:32:30,776
They just use it.

1319
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:34,277
What is it that you do not take to use them?

1320
01:32:34,526 --> 01:32:35,776
Tell me your name.

1321
01:32:39,275 --> 01:32:42,776
Your Name: Rezg ujj  Kapit ny!

1322
01:32:43,525 --> 01:32:46,461
Juk and then throw your big, scaly bald head,

1323
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:49,209
you can't let us go!

1324
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:16,235
It was a big game that I didn't sell Batarang!

1325
01:33:16,484 --> 01:33:17,643
Bakker, is that one?

1326
01:33:17,843 --> 01:33:19,826
- It was just that.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1327
01:33:19,926 --> 01:33:22,077
Super. I am looking for help but seriously,

1328
01:33:22,177 --> 01:33:23,601
but they are not professional weapons.

1329
01:33:23,626 --> 01:33:24,877
They did more of them.

1330
01:33:26,526 --> 01:33:29,327
"There was a door here!"
- Billy, how do we get out of here?

1331
01:33:29,576 --> 01:33:31,419
Are you krdezed? How do I know?

1332
01:33:32,419 --> 01:33:33,769
- That's it!
- Fut s, fut s.

1333
01:33:33,869 --> 01:33:35,510
Darla is showing.
Igyi or Darla.

1334
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,659
Hurry - hurry!

1335
01:33:36,710 --> 01:33:37,510
Kids?

1336
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,510
Is this open?

1337
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:41,511
Freddy?

1338
01:33:41,711 --> 01:33:42,759
Mary?

1339
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:47,776
Pedro, Pedro come on.

1340
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:49,351
Freddy, don't get down.

1341
01:33:49,551 --> 01:33:51,102
Stay in Darla.

1342
01:33:52,051 --> 01:33:52,853
We have to hurry!

1343
01:34:17,102 --> 01:34:17,968
! H!

1344
01:34:19,219 --> 01:34:20,468
How many doors are there.

1345
01:34:21,717 --> 01:34:23,718
One can only go out, right?

1346
01:34:23,918 --> 01:34:25,468
H t, rem lem.

1347
01:34:42,902 --> 01:34:44,151
Bad door.

1348
01:34:57,651 --> 01:35:00,177
Well, you're done, we don't open more doors!

1349
01:35:00,377 --> 01:35:01,676
No, Billy. Get something out.

1350
01:35:01,876 --> 01:35:03,176
Of course, I try.

1351
01:35:03,376 --> 01:35:05,676
Billy, try to remember.
What did you mean last time?

1352
01:35:05,876 --> 01:35:08,036
Last time I was thinking of the metro. Because I was there.

1353
01:35:08,219 --> 01:35:10,518
Forget it. Think about the metro,

1354
01:35:10,618 --> 01:35:12,068
or anywhere. Just don't do that.

1355
01:35:35,117 --> 01:35:37,618
- Come on, come on.
- What do you cover my eyes?

1356
01:35:37,818 --> 01:35:40,292
Are you joking? Did this place come to your mind?

1357
01:35:40,492 --> 01:35:41,385
Gladly.

1358
01:35:41,386 --> 01:35:43,635
Why couldn't I see what was inside?

1359
01:35:43,885 --> 01:35:47,136
- Because it's small or small.
- I'm small, but I like that music.

1360
01:35:47,385 --> 01:35:48,885
Not  n vil gom.

1361
01:35:48,985 --> 01:35:49,726
Where is Freddy?

1362
01:35:49,826 --> 01:35:52,635
Yeah, pseudo. Yeah, and very happy karit k v nok.

1363
01:35:52,835 --> 01:35:53,915
Freddy. What are you doing?

1364
01:35:54,086 --> 01:35:55,884
H t, just so kind.

1365
01:35:55,968 --> 01:35:58,668
- Are you so kind? Come on.
- I have a star on them,  n it!

1366
01:35:59,068 --> 01:36:01,028
- No. We do not look at it.
- Come on.

1367
01:36:01,176 --> 01:36:01,826
Which way?

1368
01:36:04,476 --> 01:36:05,621
Vrj.

1369
01:36:09,909 --> 01:36:11,661
-Pressure. -Pressure.
Everyone, now!

1370
01:36:11,861 --> 01:36:13,911
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.
One, h, ...

1371
01:36:14,111 --> 01:36:15,260
Up. Fast!

1372
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:27,660
Futsal. Futsal. Futsal.
You too. You too, Pedro.

1373
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:43,226
Let's just relax, naturally, as the kids are doing it all over.

1374
01:36:43,326 --> 01:36:44,775
Don't find us here.

1375
01:36:45,937 --> 01:36:48,618
Relax!   is just one.
Just do it if you want someone ...

1376
01:36:49,276 --> 01:36:51,025
- You could come back.
- He's here.

1377
01:36:51,225 --> 01:36:52,121
Do not photograph. Not.

1378
01:36:52,321 --> 01:36:53,869
- Where's ...
- Shazam!

1379
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:14,643
Oops, sorry. I found a baby.

1380
01:37:16,393 --> 01:37:17,892
Nzd. What's that?

1381
01:37:23,893 --> 01:37:25,394
Champion!

1382
01:37:28,392 --> 01:37:30,235
You don't ledrdemled the champion name.

1383
01:37:34,485 --> 01:37:37,236
Innocent people will die for you.

1384
01:37:39,668 --> 01:37:42,168
Because your soul is a little boy.

1385
01:37:42,368 --> 01:37:43,617
Who's really great now.

1386
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:47,010
Oh no!

1387
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,444
- Oh, what do we do?
- Hang on!

1388
01:38:17,194 --> 01:38:19,034
Here's the chance to be cool.

1389
01:38:19,535 --> 01:38:20,876
Hlyskedsz? No.

1390
01:38:21,076 --> 01:38:23,377
Who knows that  reg moves the spirit of heat?

1391
01:38:23,577 --> 01:38:25,876
And you have a super power like you.

1392
01:38:26,076 --> 01:38:27,667
And so see how you know what you're doing.

1393
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:29,868
And you are my best friend, so don't die.

1394
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,126
If a superhero can't save his or her family,

1395
01:38:34,627 --> 01:38:36,126
then it is not real hs.

1396
01:38:40,376 --> 01:38:41,810
Well, this is a dead end.

1397
01:38:43,311 --> 01:38:44,060
Shazam!

1398
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:55,060
Let's miss it once.

1399
01:39:09,311 --> 01:39:11,086
Leave it up!

1400
01:39:18,576 --> 01:39:19,768
Billy, watch me!

1401
01:39:23,019 --> 01:39:25,017
Lazer eye. You've got a laser!

1402
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:27,676
You're stealing because you can't fuck me!

1403
01:39:37,202 --> 01:39:38,702
This is the power matrix.

1404
01:39:38,902 --> 01:39:39,701
What is it?

1405
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:41,421
If the demons emerge from the body,

1406
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:45,043
his super power disappears, and Batarang hurt him.

1407
01:39:46,342 --> 01:39:46,842
H!

1408
01:39:46,992 --> 01:39:47,793
We are here!

1409
01:39:49,244 --> 01:39:51,543
But what are you doing now?
Let's remove them.

1410
01:39:51,743 --> 01:39:54,185
If you miss out on the eyes, it will be harmless.

1411
01:39:54,385 --> 01:39:55,884
Get them!

1412
01:40:33,886 --> 01:40:34,635
Here it is.

1413
01:40:34,835 --> 01:40:35,885
Get it.

1414
01:40:37,385 --> 01:40:38,634
Stretch to yourself.

1415
01:40:38,834 --> 01:40:40,036
Get your eyes on.

1416
01:40:40,935 --> 01:40:42,436
Everything will be fine.

1417
01:40:42,636 --> 01:40:43,316
Do not boil.

1418
01:40:44,435 --> 01:40:45,035
He's right.

1419
01:41:25,892 --> 01:41:27,143
Shazam!

1420
01:41:55,644 --> 01:41:57,011
Fear of playing.

1421
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:00,260
Your friends can't help.

1422
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:06,601
H!

1423
01:42:59,052 --> 01:42:59,900
Get away!

1424
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:01,150
It's a little trick.

1425
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:02,151
The clever.

1426
01:43:03,152 --> 01:43:04,343
Only one.

1427
01:43:05,243 --> 01:43:06,743
I have better troubles.

1428
01:43:08,244 --> 01:43:09,243
But this is something.

1429
01:43:10,084 --> 01:43:11,335
Eat it out.

1430
01:43:18,086 --> 01:43:18,926
Elg!

1431
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:37,860
Billy, there's some ugly god in the eye!

1432
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:39,667
Burn it out of your face and make it!

1433
01:43:39,668 --> 01:43:41,269
His strength is from there.

1434
01:43:45,669 --> 01:43:46,951
Come on!

1435
01:43:48,701 --> 01:43:49,701
If you dare.

1436
01:43:58,543 --> 01:43:59,793
Smart box.

1437
01:44:02,134 --> 01:44:03,884
Put your hand on the stick.

1438
01:44:04,836 --> 01:44:05,985
Billy, don't do it, Billy!

1439
01:44:07,085 --> 01:44:08,885
Billy, no! Get up!

1440
01:44:28,636 --> 01:44:31,136
Tell me my name to see my power.

1441
01:44:32,636 --> 01:44:35,551
I'll open my mouth for you, Billy Batson.

1442
01:44:35,751 --> 01:44:37,251
Because it is r  or r .

1443
01:44:37,451 --> 01:44:40,001
You're the champion, the champion.

1444
01:44:40,101 --> 01:44:43,751
Open your mouth, and you will experience your true strength.

1445
01:44:44,251 --> 01:44:46,751
Act on your skin and your skin.

1446
01:44:55,301 --> 01:44:56,551
Let's see your hands.

1447
01:45:01,702 --> 01:45:02,976
Say my name!

1448
01:45:03,776 --> 01:45:05,026
Billy!

1449
01:45:05,477 --> 01:45:08,618
No, not it! That's when I say oms and I change that!

1450
01:45:09,618 --> 01:45:10,869
Shazam!

1451
01:45:52,168 --> 01:45:53,177
How could this be?

1452
01:45:58,076 --> 01:45:59,326
I can fly!

1453
01:46:04,327 --> 01:46:06,327
Listen, you saw that.

1454
01:46:08,827 --> 01:46:09,327
No.

1455
01:46:10,825 --> 01:46:12,076
This is impossible.

1456
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,600
Oh, sorry, reg. I took your stick.

1457
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,601
Should I return?

1458
01:46:20,101 --> 01:46:22,102
H t, it's not a good thing to fight.

1459
01:46:22,851 --> 01:46:24,852
But I think we're gonna get the fuck up!

1460
01:46:25,052 --> 01:46:25,850
Normally.

1461
01:46:37,352 --> 01:46:39,285
I think I'm dirty fast.

1462
01:46:39,485 --> 01:46:42,285
Let's see ... Hippers!

1463
01:46:42,785 --> 01:46:43,785
Pipe.

1464
01:46:49,968 --> 01:46:51,218
Oh, Lord!

1465
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:54,718
Billy. Eye!

1466
01:47:02,469 --> 01:47:03,718
Vigyzz!

1467
01:47:08,218 --> 01:47:09,151
What is this?

1468
01:47:12,743 --> 01:47:14,652
We? Almost blown up!

1469
01:48:00,993 --> 01:48:04,452
Tes. From the top I can see all the super heroes.

1470
01:48:05,702 --> 01:48:07,044
What do you know?

1471
01:48:11,293 --> 01:48:12,793
I mix myself ...

1472
01:48:46,284 --> 01:48:48,551
There are no doors.

1473
01:48:49,752 --> 01:48:51,250
You think a rocket ...

1474
01:48:54,501 --> 01:48:55,594
What you say?

1475
01:48:55,794 --> 01:48:57,343
You'll make it easy.

1476
01:48:57,943 --> 01:48:59,843
In my life ...

1477
01:49:00,934 --> 01:49:01,935
Kihastom ...

1478
01:49:03,235 --> 01:49:06,935
Now, what was it like to be a messy mess or what?

1479
01:49:07,286 --> 01:49:10,685
Approximately 2 km away or from me, the noise is great, I can't hear it!

1480
01:49:11,026 --> 01:49:13,527
I will be the master of all things.

1481
01:49:13,727 --> 01:49:16,527
I just see that the word is moving,
but I can't hear anything!

1482
01:49:16,727 --> 01:49:19,868
I just have the power to ...

1483
01:49:20,068 --> 01:49:20,618
We?

1484
01:49:21,068 --> 01:49:22,119
Let me drop it!

1485
01:49:53,868 --> 01:49:55,735
Oh no! It's terrible!

1486
01:50:03,235 --> 01:50:04,076
Hello.

1487
01:50:04,826 --> 01:50:06,175
Hoh , but I caught you.

1488
01:50:17,627 --> 01:50:18,327
This is it!

1489
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:20,210
I think.

1490
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:27,852
experiment,. I just like it.

1491
01:50:44,802 --> 01:50:49,534
You may not believe it, but you are the first evil I fight with, just like my big bang.

1492
01:51:04,786 --> 01:51:06,536
Help the Tab!

1493
01:51:14,786 --> 01:51:16,152
Get it out!

1494
01:51:20,901 --> 01:51:22,901
Hello. Nah , you are just that.

1495
01:51:23,902 --> 01:51:26,652
I was cool, and I was very happy.

1496
01:51:32,151 --> 01:51:33,652
  , Bass!

1497
01:51:34,585 --> 01:51:35,936
No, no, no, no, no!

1498
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:07,451
- Shazam is here!
- I will have a lot of light!

1499
01:52:44,451 --> 01:52:46,950
Let's get the heat out of the air, right?

1500
01:52:47,092 --> 01:52:49,259
I'm not a mathsian, but

1501
01:52:49,410 --> 01:52:52,161
the big madman is the anger, right?

1502
01:52:52,361 --> 01:52:54,501
Then there is glory.
Nan.

1503
01:52:56,001 --> 01:52:56,751
Kevlysg.

1504
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:59,751
F sv nys g, rests g, bujas g. H.

1505
01:52:59,951 --> 01:53:02,751
I thought it was going to be much better if you had heat.

1506
01:53:03,343 --> 01:53:06,093
But this is just six, where is the seventh lucky?

1507
01:53:06,893 --> 01:53:08,544
Where's the little one?
The envy?

1508
01:53:08,843 --> 01:53:11,935
Can you find me and my family?
Because we're so big?

1509
01:53:12,135 --> 01:53:13,152
Just come.

1510
01:53:13,352 --> 01:53:15,185
The rest of the boys came out in tears.

1511
01:53:15,436 --> 01:53:17,335
Because they are big, strong, strong.

1512
01:53:17,435 --> 01:53:18,726
De az envy ...

1513
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:21,276
   a small tip.

1514
01:53:34,119 --> 01:53:37,619
The other point is never going to get into the party, right?

1515
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:38,911
Because   is a laser.

1516
01:53:39,959 --> 01:53:44,710
The unfortunate, disgusting, sadness is envy.

1517
01:54:11,027 --> 01:54:12,077
Well, that's it. Bukta.

1518
01:54:13,727 --> 01:54:14,527
Shazam!

1519
01:54:21,417 --> 01:54:22,468
Shazam!

1520
01:54:33,168 --> 01:54:34,918
So? Get your buddy together?

1521
01:55:03,659 --> 01:55:04,168
Not.

1522
01:55:04,268 --> 01:55:04,826
Not!

1523
01:55:06,376 --> 01:55:07,126
Not!

1524
01:55:37,493 --> 01:55:38,243
The power is good.

1525
01:55:39,492 --> 01:55:43,494
But there's nothing if you can't share it with others.

1526
01:55:45,485 --> 01:55:46,743
- Spy!
- Td m!

1527
01:55:47,085 --> 01:55:48,011
This is a disgust.

1528
01:55:48,036 --> 01:55:49,176
Kivgzs.

1529
01:55:50,676 --> 01:55:52,176
Fuck it. I thought ...

1530
01:55:55,476 --> 01:55:56,177
What?

1531
01:56:02,268 --> 01:56:04,769
I can get something I can buy.

1532
01:56:08,019 --> 01:56:09,519
- Billy. Not.
- Billy, no!

1533
01:56:09,719 --> 01:56:10,810
Don't do it!

1534
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:17,761
This is not funny!

1535
01:56:18,061 --> 01:56:21,111
Do you think I'll put a dongo in my head?

1536
01:56:21,211 --> 01:56:23,201
- I didn't bother you.
- It was cow funny.

1537
01:56:23,401 --> 01:56:24,543
I also almost took it.

1538
01:56:24,743 --> 01:56:25,798
H , note.

1539
01:56:32,293 --> 01:56:33,294
H , hell !

1540
01:56:44,126 --> 01:56:45,327
This is it.

1541
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:49,317
Sikerlt!

1542
01:56:50,067 --> 01:56:51,069
Megcsinltuk!

1543
01:56:53,218 --> 01:56:56,068
Now there is no damage!
You're safe.

1544
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:57,260
Nothing wrong.

1545
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,120
Everything is alright.
Everything is alright.

1546
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,911
Happy crown for everyone!

1547
01:57:04,951 --> 01:57:06,201
  s Hanuk t!

1548
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:11,302
Are you sure he'll be?

1549
01:57:13,502 --> 01:57:14,342
You said it.

1550
01:57:33,085 --> 01:57:35,276
You know where we are?

1551
01:57:35,476 --> 01:57:38,026
In a cave filled with monsters.

1552
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:39,026
J.

1553
01:57:39,226 --> 01:57:39,919
True.

1554
01:57:40,119 --> 01:57:41,368
But this is ...

1555
01:57:44,117 --> 01:57:45,118
This is it!

1556
01:57:45,318 --> 01:57:46,568
Our hiding place.

1557
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:53,660
But why?

1558
01:57:55,461 --> 01:57:58,801
The six superheroes can be said not to be a tragedy.

1559
01:57:59,001 --> 01:58:00,801
And now everyone is safe.

1560
01:58:00,802 --> 01:58:03,301
I'll talk to an eyewitness who's gonna go ...

1561
01:58:03,801 --> 01:58:04,602
It was rough...

1562
01:58:04,802 --> 01:58:05,644
It's coarser.

1563
01:58:06,143 --> 01:58:06,893
Infernal ...

1564
01:58:07,093 --> 01:58:08,013
they were.

1565
01:58:08,393 --> 01:58:09,644
Mindjet.

1566
01:58:10,442 --> 01:58:11,802
Because each one is ...

1567
01:58:12,235 --> 01:58:13,735
Unom m r.

1568
01:58:13,935 --> 01:58:15,484
I am F radt,  s m r damn enough of this.

1569
01:58:20,626 --> 01:58:22,127
No, I'm not racist.

1570
01:58:22,827 --> 01:58:23,427
Ha!

1571
01:58:24,377 --> 01:58:25,527
Let's see your hands.

1572
01:58:25,826 --> 01:58:26,826
  ,  !

1573
01:58:30,626 --> 01:58:31,526
Vrjatok.

1574
01:58:31,726 --> 01:58:33,126
I'll give you a shelter.

1575
01:58:33,526 --> 01:58:34,825
  a mai maiprtrt.

1576
01:58:35,025 --> 01:58:36,577
I'll give the family a cool.

1577
01:58:37,776 --> 01:58:39,510
I thought I'd stay here now.

1578
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:43,010
Because then,

1579
01:58:43,460 --> 01:58:44,511
I'm home.

1580
01:58:57,502 --> 01:58:59,044

1581
01:59:21,243 --> 01:59:21,967
Hell .

1582
01:59:23,067 --> 01:59:24,218
Menj nk.

1583
01:59:25,518 --> 01:59:26,018
Ok s.

1584
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:31,560
What's up?

1585
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:34,310
Do you want to display the visual  ribarid?

1586
01:59:43,552 --> 01:59:44,993
H t, how did you get here?

1587
01:59:45,193 --> 01:59:46,493
All we need to do is work with you.

1588
01:59:46,693 --> 01:59:48,344
But you used to stay at home.

1589
01:59:48,544 --> 01:59:50,743
I know. But now this is a special occasion.

1590
01:59:51,835 --> 01:59:52,585
On. On.

1591
01:59:52,685 --> 01:59:53,685
What are you doing here?

1592
01:59:53,785 --> 01:59:55,336
What have you done to me?

1593
01:59:55,536 --> 01:59:56,835
Freddy Freeman!

1594
01:59:58,836 --> 02:00:03,376
This shit taught me everything about superheroes.

1595
02:00:03,676 --> 02:00:06,426
Just so you can, real pro, right.

1596
02:00:06,626 --> 02:00:09,676
Tell me what's with you?
Best friend.

1597
02:00:09,876 --> 02:00:12,768
  the best bar,  s hell , j faces.

1598
02:00:12,968 --> 02:00:16,018
You too have a head.
They are for you.

1599
02:00:17,018 --> 02:00:19,518
Did I convince my friend if I didn't mind?

1600
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:26,951
 !
