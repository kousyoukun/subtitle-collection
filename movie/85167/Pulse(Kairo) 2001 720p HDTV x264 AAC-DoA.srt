00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:17,347
A Daiei/Nippon Television Network/Hakuhodo
/IMAGICA Production

2
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,962
Change course -direction, 120 degrees

3
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,525
Roger, hard to port

4
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,425
Hard to port

5
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,327
I need navigational information

6
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,133
It all began one day,

7
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,400
without warning.

8
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,396
Like this...

9
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,386
Still no answer at Taguchi's?

10
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,319
No

11
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,492
It's been a week, he must have his reasons

12
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:47,072
It shouldn't take a whole
week to work on that disk

13
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,497
No...

14
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,470
Something's wrong

15
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,439
Maybe I should see if he's OK

16
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:57,483
I just got the creeps

17
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,151
What?

18
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,988
I don't know, I just feel
like something's wrong

19
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:07,292
Like something's... horribly wrong

20
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:25,177
What's up with Taguchi?

21
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,410
I don't know

22
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:32,349
If we don't get that disk
now, we're in real trouble

23
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,955
The deadline's tomorrow

24
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,123
I know that

25
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:42,552
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't heard a thing

26
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,527
I think I'd better go see how he's doing

27
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:56,267
A Kiyoshi Kurosawa film

28
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,366
Taguchi?

29
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:27,398
KAIRO (Pulse)

30
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,930
Hey, you are here

31
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,066
Hey. Michi...

32
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,102
I was worried about you, you haven't called

33
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,369
Right, sorry

34
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,141
Did you finish working on that disk?

35
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,512
Yeah, it's somewhere in that pile

36
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,454
You OK? Are you sick?

37
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,478
No...

38
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,993
What have you been up to, all
on your lonesome? We're friends

39
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,962
Yeah... stuff...

40
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,457
Help yourself to the disk

41
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,396
You ought to label your disks

42
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,370
This it?

43
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,261
The one marked Work File?

44
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,364
Taguchi?

45
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,422
Michi

46
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:21,967
Oh, Junco

47
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,169
You OK? Was it awful?

48
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,971
I'm fine

49
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,533
I'd say it's break time

50
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,045
Oh, I forgot, here

51
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,381
Thanks

52
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:46,286
It's so upsetting

53
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,395
I don't know what he was so depressed about

54
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:56,358
He never said anything, so
what could we have done?

55
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,429
Maybe.

56
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,342
He suddenly just wanted to die

57
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,507
I get that way sometimes

58
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,316
It's so easy to hang yourself

59
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,172
Hey! Why so gloomy

60
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,141
Oh, sorry

61
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,143
About Taguchi?

62
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,480
It's just... If only I'd...

63
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,407
He seemed like the Taguchi I know

64
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:50,421
I never imagined he'd
do something like that

65
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,487
Time to put it behind us
Besides, it wasn't your fault

66
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,451
Yeah...

67
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,510
Say... Would you take a look?

68
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,078
At what?

69
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,277
Taguchi's disk

70
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,450
What is it?

71
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,494
It's Taguchi's place

72
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,136
Is that Taguchi?

73
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,371
Yeah, I think so

74
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,509
Look

75
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,953
What's going on? Isn't that the same scene?

76
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,187
I can't tell

77
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,057
Hey. Look

78
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,427
That's a face...

79
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,029
A reflection

80
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,096
You're right

81
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,489
Can you blow it up?

82
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,269
Let me see...

83
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,422
That was Taguchi wasn't it?

84
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,560
Sure seems like it

85
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,469
What's going on?

86
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,040
Maybe something strange is going on

87
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,975
Strange?

88
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,043
I don't know

89
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,470
I don't even care anymore

90
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,482
Something's definitely not right

91
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,957
A message in a bottle launched 10 years ago

92
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,992
by a boy on Tanegashima Island.

93
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,161
Was recently discovered

94
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:14,522
on a beach in Malaysia some 4,000 kms away

95
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,527
Hikono Koichi was

96
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:21,106
a 4th grader when he sent off his message

97
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,909
Members of a local group,
cleaning up the beach,

98
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,080
a sea turtle habitat,

99
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,015
discovered the bottle by accident

100
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:35,153
I never imagined it would find
it's way to some foreign country

101
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:39,057
I was shocked to get an
answer after 10 years

102
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,926
The group located Hikono

103
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,264
through his former elementary school

104
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,167
Next, the National Weather Service

105
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,938
forecasts another unseasonably hot summer,
it's the 3rd

106
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,076
for eastern Japan... for western Japan...

107
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,537
Northern Japan... will...

108
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:11,383
"Welcome to the Internet"

109
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,124
No, this way, here

110
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,458
OK

111
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,996
Next, OK

112
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,421
Next

113
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,404
"Have Fun"
OK I'll have fun

114
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,531
Done "OK"

115
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,509
What's this crap? Yes, I agree

116
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,455
Next...

117
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:03,324
What? I guess that's OK

118
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,497
Next again, huh

119
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,407
What?

120
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:19,443
What the... oh well...

121
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,493
What the hell...

122
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,149
Hey... this...

123
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,452
Who's... what's...

124
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,384
Would you like to meet a ghost?

125
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,498
Stupid crap!

126
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,326
What the...

127
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:10,087
Maybe you should change the size on this
batch file

128
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:11,923
Using the variable?

129
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,348
Yeah

130
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,557
So you'll find it's property, right?

131
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,527
Oh, conventional memory

132
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,357
Right

133
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,496
See

134
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,363
So that's how you do it

135
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,543
Say...

136
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,512
Can the internet dial you up itself?

137
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,520
You in computer science?

138
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,929
No, economics, no relation

139
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,494
Huh...
Sounds like a hacker

140
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,069
A hacker...

141
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,530
Huh...

142
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,544
It said
"Do you want to meet a ghost?"

143
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,481
Some website like that

144
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,384
A ghost, huh...

145
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,159
Which website was that?

146
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,028
What?

147
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,964
Something about meeting ghosts?

148
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,935
I don't really know. It
just appeared last night

149
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,429
Know the address?

150
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,040
What? Um... address?

151
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,273
I see

152
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,146
Windows?

153
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,243
Yeah

154
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,016
Open the Explorer log...

155
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,185
Oh, no, no, I really don't

156
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,385
know anything about computers

157
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,517
The next time the site shows up,

158
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,526
click on it to bookmark it

159
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,493
Not so fast

160
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,493
Click...

161
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,444
Can you repeat that?

162
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:46,978
Click on it

163
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,113
Click... on... it...

164
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,015
To bookmark it

165
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,511
To...

166
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,121
Bookmark it

167
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,514
If that doesn't work,

168
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,521
You know the print screen key?

169
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,128
Yeah, this one?

170
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,327
Try pressing it

171
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,333
If it doesn't work...

172
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,037
Print screen key

173
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,533
Press the...

174
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,976
Print screen...

175
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,044
Got it

176
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,504
Let me know?

177
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,780
Sure

178
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,507
See you

179
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,177
Don't bother with that Mom

180
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,547
What? Sure

181
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,515
Are you eating this junk again?

182
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,359
It's not good for you

183
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,291
I'm going now

184
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,071
Have you called your father?

185
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,496
Nope

186
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:26,143
I see... but what if you get in trouble?

187
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,378
I can't rush over

188
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,052
It's awkward for me to
see him, but you should

189
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,445
Forget it. He's out of the picture

190
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,924
He lives here in Tokyo

191
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,959
But Tokyo's huge

192
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,521
I know, but...

193
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,030
I'm fine. I've got my friends

194
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,166
You sure? I guess you'll be alright then

195
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,503
You're so trusting and get carried away...

196
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,401
Hello

197
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,149
Hello

198
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,382
Help...

199
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,286
Help...

200
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,520
Help...

201
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,454
Who's this?

202
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,329
Help...

203
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,087
What is this...

204
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,457
The Forbidden Room

205
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,328
Taguchi?

206
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,563
What happened, Taguchi...

207
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,563
What?

208
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,309
What am I saying?

209
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,304
What happened to Yabe?

210
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,442
Try his house?

211
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,152
No answer

212
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,486
Huh...

213
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,381
I hope nothing's wrong

214
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,457
Oh no, what's he up to?

215
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,534
I've got to go see him

216
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,969
No! Don't go!

217
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,005
He'll turn up. He'll come if we wait!

218
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:38,342
Nothing strange has happened yet

219
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,433
Yeah...

220
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,147
Let's just act normal

221
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:47,280
Yeah, at least for today

222
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,531
Sorry, I'm late

223
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,466
Sure, sure

224
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,369
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

225
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,337
Hey!

226
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:23,120
Can you believe, he's ignoring us!

227
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,955
What's going on?

228
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,450
Who cares...

229
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,958
What do I do now?

230
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,328
Click it,

231
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,457
and bookmark it

232
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,524
Doesn't work

233
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,533
If that doesn't work, press
the print screen key

234
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,371
There

235
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,418
Hi

236
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,558
You're the one...

237
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,066
Um...

238
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,527
Kawashima

239
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,070
Kawashima

240
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,530
Yeah, Kawashima

241
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,108
I'm Karasawa Harue

242
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:14,569
Harue san, Harue san

243
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,478
How'd it go?

244
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,121
Well, it came back again

245
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:26,546
Really?

246
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,158
Yeah

247
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,061
And,

248
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,456
I pressed that print screen key...

249
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,395
Right

250
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,498
Can I come over and check it out?

251
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,439
Yeah, sure, absolutely fine

252
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,540
I just need a minute

253
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,304
Um...

254
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,309
What's this?

255
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:28,349
That? Something we programmed here

256
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,089
If two dots get too close, they die,

257
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,359
but if they get too far
apart, they're drawn closer

258
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:41,265
Huh... what's it for?

259
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,363
A miniature model of our world...

260
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,508
But only the grad student who designed it
understands it

261
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,455
I wouldn't...

262
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,427
Suggest staring at it too long

263
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:30,146
Sorry, it's a mess

264
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,277
Thank you

265
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,518
There you go

266
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,388
Thank you

267
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,033
Getting the data?

268
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,335
Yeah, almost set

269
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:22,390
What got you started on the internet?

270
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,431
Nothing in particular...

271
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:30,040
You don't like computers, right?

272
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,431
No

273
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,312
Wanted to connect with other people?

274
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:41,451
Maybe... I don't really know

275
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,378
Everybody else is into it

276
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,025
People don't really connect, you know

277
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,450
What?

278
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,457
Like those dots simulating humans

279
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,394
We all live totally separately

280
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,376
That's how it seems to me

281
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,274
Oh... Huh...

282
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,373
I wonder...

283
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,324
Yabe...

284
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,034
Kudo san

285
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,068
Yes

286
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:36,406
Can you move these orchids
into the greenhouse?

287
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,332
Yes

288
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,088
Um, boss...

289
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,479
Yes?

290
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,060
Isn't Yabe acting strange?

291
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,259
You think so?

292
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,098
Can I go check on him?

293
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,434
Fine, but...

294
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,328
It might be a waste of time

295
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:15,537
Words said in friendship
with the best of intentions

296
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,282
always wind up hurting your friends deeply

297
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,517
And then you wind up getting hurt

298
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,486
Is friendship always that way?

299
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,487
If that's so, what's left?

300
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,263
If I were you...

301
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:46,300
Who needs friends like that

302
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:51,278
A courageous choice in itself

303
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,563
Are you OK?

304
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:20,267
Did something happen?

305
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,316
If something happened, let's talk about it

306
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,460
Both Junco and I,

307
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,388
are really worried

308
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,298
I saw...

309
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,430
A face...

310
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,329
What?

311
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,535
A horrible face...

312
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,405
I've never seen anything like it...

313
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:02,353
What are you saying? What did you see?

314
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,022
The Forbidden Room

315
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,359
Forbidden Room? What's that?

316
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,491
Is that...

317
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,562
The room with the red tape?

318
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,498
Don't dare go in there!

319
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,273
Please,

320
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,439
tell me

321
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,447
What happened?

322
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,552
I'm cold

323
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,298
Yabe...

324
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,433
Are you OK?

325
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,315
Exit

326
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,419
Harue

327
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,354
Hi

328
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:41,003
I don't really use the library much

329
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,464
Couldn't find the way out

330
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,304
Phantoms

331
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,382
You reading this?

332
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,342
Yeah

333
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,516
Is it related to your work in the lab?

334
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,449
Yeah

335
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,487
Huh...

336
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,967
Do you have a minute?

337
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,429
What? Sure

338
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,269
Come

339
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,526
Isn't it strange?

340
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,421
Yeah... sort of...

341
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,498
Almost like ghosts, right?

342
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,345
You're right, they're like ghosts

343
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:02,511
Sometimes, these turn up

344
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,389
At first, they look like the other dots

345
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,451
What are they?

346
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,292
I don't know

347
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,131
A bug?

348
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,262
No

349
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,119
That website...

350
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,544
What?

351
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:43,418
Oh, what happened with that?

352
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,128
Nothing... yet...

353
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,519
Huh...

354
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,493
But I think they're related...

355
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,405
I'm sure they're related

356
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,271
You think?

357
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,955
Let me know if anything happens

358
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,483
Yeah, sure

359
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,495
Karasawa san

360
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,136
I need you to check this

361
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,267
Yes

362
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,433
And you are?

363
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,538
My friend, Kawashima

364
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,368
Huh...

365
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,047
The grad student, Yoshizaki san

366
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,416
Hello

367
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,467
I forgot to give you my number

368
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,074
Oh, right

369
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,307
Call me, OK?

370
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,011
Right

371
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,539
Anytime, OK?

372
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,014
Yeah

373
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:13,474
Thank you

374
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:23,359
"Everyone dies, therefore there's no
logical reason for ghosts not to exist..."

375
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:28,526
"How many ghosts have..."

376
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:32,360
"existed since prehistoric times..."

377
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,285
Do you see it too?

378
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:57,427
Sure you do, because it's really there

379
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:02,331
Who is that?

380
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:06,335
You'll have to catch him to find out

381
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:11,339
Start right now, and you might succeed

382
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,146
Have a go?

383
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,048
What?

384
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,351
Why don't you, right now

385
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,932
He disappeared

386
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,494
I see

387
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:18,273
He must be a student... I don't know him

388
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:23,244
Maybe you're right. Sorry I encouraged you

389
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,371
See you

390
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:30,316
wait a minute

391
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,393
Just what was that?

392
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,468
I'm cold...

393
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:14,293
The spirit...

394
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,133
Or consciousness, the soul,
whatever you want to call it,

395
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:22,562
it turns out the realm they
inhabit has a finite capacity

396
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:28,410
Whether that capacity accommodates billions
or trillions,

397
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,472
eventually, it will run out of space

398
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:36,151
Once it's filled to the brim,

399
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:40,284
it's got to overflow somehow, somewhere

400
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,418
But where?

401
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,962
The souls have no choice

402
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:50,458
but to ooze into another realm,
that is to say, our world

403
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:54,460
Maybe, at first...

404
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,307
it started with something really simple

405
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,458
Once that realm reached critical mass,

406
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,495
any device would have sufficed

407
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:31,173
Thrown it together with the
means and materials at hand

408
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,142
That's how I see it

409
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:37,412
Excuse me, do you have any tape?

410
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:41,484
Anything will do, some tape

411
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,445
How's this?

412
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,479
Thank you

413
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,423
After many hours or days,

414
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:24,555
or many weeks, it finally happens

415
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:18,113
Through that process, it
spreads around the world

416
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:22,474
But now they're no longer the
faint presence they began as

417
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:26,322
You saw one yourself

418
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:33,062
I don't believe your stories

419
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:36,490
Right, sorry, it's all hypothetical

420
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,005
Thanks for the tea

421
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,073
Are you OK?

422
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,306
Just fine

423
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,111
But if this really happened,

424
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,504
there's no turning back

425
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,150
No matter how simple the device,

426
00:55:55,151 --> 00:56:00,122
once the system's complete,
it'll function on its own

427
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,424
and become permanent

428
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,451
In other words,

429
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:08,355
the passage is now open...
that's how it looks

430
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,997
Hello

431
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,368
Oh, I see, our boss isn't there?

432
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,103
Yes, I understand

433
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:51,039
If he does stop by,

434
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,501
will you please ask him to call us?

435
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:58,407
Yes, thank you very much

436
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,514
Michi.

437
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,451
What do you think is going on?

438
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,428
Why's everyone disappearing?

439
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:39,054
Oh, hello, this is Sunny
Plant Sales calling

440
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,957
Thank you for your business

441
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:46,295
Is our boss there with you by any chance?

442
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:52,264
Oh, I see... Thank you, and excuse me

443
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,533
I'll go look for him

444
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,433
Wait, Junco, wait

445
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,280
Yes. Hello...

446
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,448
Boss?

447
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,389
Help

448
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,420
Yabe!

449
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,262
Are you Yabe?

450
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,462
Yabe!

451
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,472
Help me...

452
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,420
Help me...

453
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,391
Help...

454
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,396
Help...

455
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,290
Junco...

456
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,454
Junco!

457
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,336
Junco, no!

458
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,365
Junco!

459
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,412
Are you OK?

460
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,278
Are you OK?

461
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:47,401
Junco

462
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,394
Help me...

463
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:48,396
Help me...

464
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,498
Help me...

465
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:58,146
Junco!

466
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,449
Look, I'm right here

467
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,411
I'm right here, it's OK

468
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:31,343
Excuse me

469
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,538
Karasawa Harue
tel: 090 -4079 -2677

470
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:52,281
What are you doing, Harue!

471
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,342
You're dripping wet!

472
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,515
They went away...

473
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,990
They've all disappeared...
They always do...

474
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,484
I have to run away...

475
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,257
Run away somewhere...

476
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,455
Harue!

477
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,393
Hey. Harue!

478
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,463
Listen, Harue!

479
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,464
Harue!

480
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,401
Calm down! Harue!

481
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,356
Thank you...

482
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:17,522
I always wondered what it's like to die...

483
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,529
From when I was really little...

484
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,467
I was always alone

485
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,476
Any parents or family?

486
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,346
Sure, but they're irrelevant

487
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,278
Right...

488
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,154
That after death,

489
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:42,991
you live happily with everyone over there

490
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,160
Can we stop talking about this?

491
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:47,462
But it may be true

492
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,295
Sure, but...

493
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:55,470
Then in high school it dawned on me

494
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:01,309
you might be all alone after death, too

495
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,015
There's no way to know

496
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,083
How could you?

497
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:12,477
The idea was so terrifying

498
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,383
I couldn't even bear it

499
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:20,061
That nothing changes with death,

500
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:23,296
just right now, forever

501
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:33,307
Is that what becoming a ghost is about?

502
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:38,012
You can't mess with that. It's really bad

503
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:41,542
What have ghosts got to do with us?

504
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,547
Besides, we're alive

505
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:48,515
Then, who are they?

506
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,461
Are they really alive?

507
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,397
How are they different from ghosts?

508
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,313
In fact,

509
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,445
ghosts and people are the same,

510
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,417
whether they're dead or alive

511
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:29,554
It's not right. It's wrong

512
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,368
They're all crazy

513
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,972
Nobody knows what happens when you die

514
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:42,435
All this about ghosts, but I won't
believe in them, even if I see one

515
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,472
But I do know,

516
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:50,084
that I'm definitely alive and so are you,
Harue

517
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:52,454
That's for sure, right?

518
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:58,425
So I don't want to think about
the fact we'll die someday

519
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,389
Just maybe...

520
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,100
In 10 years, or at least
while we're still alive,

521
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:09,037
they'll invent a drug that prevents death

522
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,465
Then, we could live forever and ever

523
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:17,435
Of course you might think I'm
crazy to say that, but...

524
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,316
I'd rather bet on that

525
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,376
You want to live forever?

526
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,311
Yeah

527
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:29,090
That sounds like fun?

528
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:32,359
Yeah... That's what I think

529
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:43,335
Huh... Maybe I've got it all wrong

530
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:49,306
No...

531
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:55,282
It'll turn out just like you say

532
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:59,316
I'm sure

533
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,346
What?

534
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,395
Ghosts won't kill people

535
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:12,300
Because that would just make more ghosts

536
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,529
Isn't that right?

537
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:23,309
Instead, they'll try to
make people immortal

538
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,317
By quietly...

539
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,381
trapping them in their own loneliness

540
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,524
Help...

541
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,362
Help...

542
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:57,472
Junco, it'll be OK

543
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:00,408
It'll be OK

544
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:02,503
OK...

545
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,425
I fell asleep...

546
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,497
How do you feel?

547
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:31,362
Yeah

548
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:35,477
Something to drink? How about some coffee?

549
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:50,425
Michi...

550
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,450
What?

551
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,492
Am I just going to die like this?

552
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,531
Of course not

553
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:05,438
That's right...

554
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,502
I'll just keep on living, all alone...

555
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,167
What?

556
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,298
No

557
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,396
Junco!

558
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,366
Junco

559
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,336
Junco!

560
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,487
Junco!

561
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:40,496
Why! Why!

562
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:52,440
Junco, don't go!

563
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:55,247
Junco

564
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,392
Mother?

565
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,270
Mother?

566
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,369
Mother!

567
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,511
I'll be right there

568
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:40,398
Harue...

569
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,474
Harue! Hey...

570
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:55,321
Kawashima... take me with you

571
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:02,287
I'm scared to be alone

572
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,531
Take me somewhere

573
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:25,251
OK, sure

574
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:27,922
Where to?

575
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:29,484
Somewhere far away

576
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,993
Out of Order

577
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,454
Shit, let's just go!

578
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,368
There's no one...

579
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,465
No...

580
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:30,385
Where did everyone go?

581
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,483
I'm here

582
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:43,531
I'm here beside you

583
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:50,396
Even if,

584
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:54,533
there's no one else, it doesn't matter

585
01:21:55,944 --> 01:22:00,304
We are both definitely here

586
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:10,322
Guess that's true...

587
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:43,320
What happened!

588
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:50,030
I've got to go back!

589
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:53,133
What? No! We've come this far!

590
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:56,003
But this is the end of the line

591
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:59,039
That's not true. It'll start moving

592
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,342
I'll go check with the driver. Come with me

593
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,080
OK, but promise you'll wait right here

594
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,473
I'll be right back. Promise

595
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,285
Harue!

596
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,486
The Forbidden Room

597
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:08,419
Construction Materials -red tape

598
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:01,433
I'm...

599
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,314
Not alone...

600
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,968
Harue.

601
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,361
It's me, Kawashima

602
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:35,509
Harue! Listen!

603
01:28:38,112 --> 01:28:41,482
Listen, what do you say to this...

604
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:44,476
The two of us live together

605
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,517
That way, we can always be together

606
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:51,519
If we keep living alone,

607
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:55,455
we'll just get worse and worse because
we're weak

608
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:58,131
We'll balance each other out

609
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:00,501
How about living that way?

610
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,103
Would you try it with me?

611
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:06,497
What do you think, Harue! Listen!

612
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,249
Harue!

613
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:19,443
Harue!

614
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,412
Harue!

615
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:35,035

Fukuda Tatsuya, age 57

624
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:57,246
Um... are you OK?

625
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:04,516
Breakdown?

626
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:08,094
Yeah

627
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,519
Want some?

628
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,409
You are?

629
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:24,503
Oh, me? Um...

630
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:28,440
What are you doing here?

631
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:34,288
What am I doing here...

632
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:37,422
You?

633
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:48,101
So neither your dad nor your mom

634
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:50,403
made it through...

635
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:52,329
No...

636
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,109
So many things happened at once,

637
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:59,446
it's impossible to sort them all out

638
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:01,404
Yeah

639
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:08,386
Me too. My head's all messed up

640
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:12,518
So you're a student, Kawashima?

641
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:14,284
Yeah

642
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:16,062
Lucky you

643
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:18,064
I don't think so

644
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:19,065
Here

645
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:21,401
Oh, thanks...

646
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:26,106
And you?

647
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:28,041
I had a job

648
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,043
Wow, amazing

649
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:32,276
Nothing amazing

650
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,376
Did you have any friends?

651
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,376
Friends?

652
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:44,124
Maybe one, I guess

653
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:46,357
What was she like?

654
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:51,465
What? I don't really know...

655
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,036
I never really found out...

656
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:58,303
Where is she?

657
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:00,366
Somewhere...

658
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:05,413
OK, try starting it

659
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:18,519
OK, good

660
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:38,044
Why don't you look for her?

661
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,435
What?

662
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:44,474
She's still somewhere, right? You've got to
help her then

663
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,250
But...

664
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:52,349
Let's go find her. I'll help you

665
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:01,433
This is the last stop...

666
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:09,433
After that we go as far as we can

667
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:17,508
I can sort of see...

668
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:20,287
The future...

669
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:34,264
"Help"

670
01:34:57,158 --> 01:34:59,390
Look over there

671
01:35:02,129 --> 01:35:04,498
An abandoned factory?

672
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:13,337
I wonder...

673
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,503
Shall we try it?

674
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:39,933
Listen, even if you see a door sealed with
red tape,

675
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:42,496
don't go near it, OK?

676
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:44,462
I know

677
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:10,353
You OK?

678
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:51,370
Look... at this

679
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:03,449
Look... over there

680
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,144
Kawashima

681
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:33,046
Harue!

682
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:34,506
Watch out!

683
01:37:36,917 --> 01:37:38,546
What happened, Harue!

684
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:42,252
What are you doing with that?

685
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:49,558
Let's get out of this place, together

686
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:53,559
Together?

687
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:56,298
Yeah

688
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:10,116
Come on, hand it over

689
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:12,383
Harue! Harue!

690
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:18,516
Oh, no, a hospital...

691
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:33,531
Harue! Don't die!

692
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:36,343
Come on! Please!

693
01:38:37,878 --> 01:38:39,302
Help me!

694
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:43,372
Harue!

695
01:38:56,964 --> 01:38:59,333
We couldn't save her...

696
01:39:01,068 --> 01:39:02,492
No...

697
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:28,461
We're out of gas...

698
01:39:29,963 --> 01:39:32,525
I'll get some, there was gas back there

699
01:39:32,933 --> 01:39:34,392
You'll be OK?

700
01:39:34,968 --> 01:39:37,303
Wait for me. I'll be OK

701
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:36,253
Forever...

702
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:40,059
Death was...

703
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:43,396
Eternal loneliness...

704
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:53,399
Help

705
01:41:54,107 --> 01:41:56,373
Help

706
01:41:56,977 --> 01:41:58,538
Help

707
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:03,249
Don't ask me!
What's that got to do with me!

708
01:42:04,051 --> 01:42:06,152
Forever...

709
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:08,454
Death was...

710
01:42:09,089 --> 01:42:11,355
Eternal loneliness...

711
01:42:18,932 --> 01:42:21,267
You're not real

712
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:25,462
I refuse to acknowledge...
Never...

713
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:28,465
I refuse to acknowledge death!

714
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,513
I know

715
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:18,358
I'll catch you

716
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:21,352
Then you'll disappear

717
01:43:22,095 --> 01:43:25,294
That's it, right! Right!

718
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:28,427
You can't beat me!

719
01:43:57,097 --> 01:43:59,363
I am...

720
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:04,395
Real...

721
01:45:58,952 --> 01:46:00,445
Kawashima!

722
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:08,994
What is it?

723
01:46:08,995 --> 01:46:11,523
Forget it... Let's go...

724
01:48:26,967 --> 01:48:29,302
It's too much...

725
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:44,510
What... Are you doing?

726
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:54,420
You went in there...

727
01:48:55,996 --> 01:48:57,420
Me?

728
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:01,492
Yeah, I did. But I'm fine

729
01:49:16,182 --> 01:49:18,448
Don't cry

730
01:49:41,942 --> 01:49:43,503
You want to go back?

731
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:47,280
To what's left of Harue?

732
01:49:52,886 --> 01:49:55,278
That make you feel better?

733
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:04,329
If that's what you want, I'll go with you

734
01:50:07,133 --> 01:50:09,297
No...

735
01:50:10,036 --> 01:50:11,529
Let's go...

736
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:14,474
As far as we can go

737
01:50:19,012 --> 01:50:21,381
Are you sure about that?

738
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,544
Yeah

739
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,499
Can you get out?

740
01:50:56,016 --> 01:50:57,406
You OK?

741
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:11,489
Be careful

742
01:51:22,108 --> 01:51:24,340
Wait here. OK?

743
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:42,413
Death comes to us all...

744
01:52:42,989 --> 01:52:46,959
If so, maybe we would have been happier,

745
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:49,488
had we gone with the rest

746
01:52:50,029 --> 01:52:53,490
But we chose to keep going

747
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,562
into the future...

748
01:53:15,922 --> 01:53:18,157
We'll head for Latin America

749
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:21,528
We're still getting signals there

750
01:53:22,061 --> 01:53:24,453
Though they're pretty weak

751
01:53:25,165 --> 01:53:28,262
We've got to give it a try,

752
01:53:28,935 --> 01:53:31,304
no matter what we find

753
01:53:33,973 --> 01:53:37,142
If anyone's survived,

754
01:53:37,143 --> 01:53:39,512
we can head out again

755
01:53:41,981 --> 01:53:44,350
and go as far as we can

756
01:53:52,892 --> 01:53:56,262
Come on, be strong

757
01:53:59,999 --> 01:54:03,460
Have I done the right thing?

758
01:54:05,138 --> 01:54:07,268
Yes

759
01:54:07,874 --> 01:54:09,141
Are you sure?

760
01:54:09,142 --> 01:54:11,009
Yes

761
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:14,312
You're doing the right thing

762
01:54:51,084 --> 01:54:55,387
Now, alone with my last
friend in the world,

763
01:54:56,089 --> 01:54:59,288
I have found happiness

764
01:55:22,982 --> 01:55:26,511
