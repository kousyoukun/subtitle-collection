1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,016
...denied reports the British
banking system is about to collapse.

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,489
According to him, Barings' failure
is a unique situation,...

3
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:26,458
...which he blames on the actions
of a rogue trader in Singapore.

4
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:31,931
Estimates of potential losses range from
800 million to over one billion pounds.

5
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:54,812
Look at that!

6
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:56,887
Will you fuckin' look at that!

7
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:59,925
- What, with the black guy?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,209
It's a shame.
She looks well spoken for.

9
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:07,403
Never know your luck, though.
Eh, mate?

10
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:11,203
- Think I'll give her the treatment!
- No, Steve, no. Don't do that.

11
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:14,206
- No, you're all right.
- Don't do that. Steve. Steve!

12
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,047
Hello, love.
I've got something to show ya.

13
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:27,209
Are you out of your mind or what?
You fuckin' little prick!

14
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:29,248
And I mean little!

15
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,721
Don't judge a book
by its cover, sweetheart.

16
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:34,610
- You're out of your league, arsehole.
- Calm down.

17
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:36,443
Fuck off or you're dead!

18
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,329
- I want you out of here, now.
- He's really sorry.

19
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:43,529
He's pissed. He meant no disrespect.
That's the last thing on anybody's mind.

20
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:46,124
Tell him if he doesn't
put that thing away,...

21
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,088
...I'll rip it off and shove it
down his fuckin' throat!

22
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,719
Do your flies up, you fuckin' animal.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

23
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,758
Just leave it.
It's not worth it!

24
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,044
He's done it again.
I had to pull him off!

25
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,881
Fuckin' right laugh!

26
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,559
Aagghh!
Aagghh!

27
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:12,804
Nick!
Nick!

28
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:14,878
You all right?
Nick!

29
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:34,554
It was thanks to Maggie Thatcher
opening up the City of London...

30
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:40,117
...that yours truly from Watford came to be
working for a posh outfit like Barings.

31
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:45,795
That was me lying on the floor,
if you hadn't guessed. Nick Leeson.

32
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:47,875
You've probably heard about me.

33
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,802
Barings was the oldest
private bank in the world.

34
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:59,434
They financed the Louisiana Purchase
back in eighteen hundred and something.

35
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:02,594
They even had the
Queen as a customer!

36
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,158
I was just a humble clerk.

37
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:11,153
But not for long, I hoped.

38
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,798
Car crash.

39
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:17,032
I hit my head on the back of
the seat and broke my nose.

40
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:21,272
Everybody else was all right cos they
were wearing their, um... seat belts.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,351
Poor chap!

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,318
Nick, I know you're keen to get out of the
back office and onto the trading floor,...

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,391
...but in the meantime
something else has come up.

44
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,993
We've got problems
in our Jakarta office.

45
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,151
We need someone to go out there
and sort things out.

46
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,149
I thought that someone might be...

47
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:41,751
...Nick Leeson?

48
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,509
Indonesia was one of the
new "tiger economies"...

49
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,031
...everyone was getting
so excited about.

50
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,790
"Emerging markets"
they were calling them,...

51
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:59,152
...and Barings was one of the first
to see their potential.

52
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:02,789
The rewards were high.
But so were the risks.

53
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,353
One hundred million pounds...

54
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:08,108
...in bearer bonds.

55
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:09,753
As good as cash.

56
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,712
We could pick 'em up,
walk out,...

57
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:14,468
...come to some arrangement
with laughing boy...

58
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,432
Customers refuse to pay for them.

59
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:19,506
They say what's on them doesn't
match the original deal.

60
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:23,030
The real reason: the market goes down,
they don't want any more.

61
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:24,945
It's a mess.

62
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:29,743
You're absolutely 100 per cent right,
Susi. It's one hell of a fuckin' mess.

63
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:38,827
It was my job to sort out
the certificates...

64
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,188
...so customers wouldn't have
any more excuses not to pay.

65
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:46,151
Until then, Barings had this bloody
great hole in their balance sheet.

66
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:49,268
It was boring work, but I knew
if I made a success of it...

67
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:51,307
...then I could write my own ticket.

68
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,269
All the certificates are in
the right denomination.

69
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:58,104
I've sorted out all the documentation.
That's all in order now, so...

70
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,908
...all I need from you...

71
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,708
...is a cheque!

72
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,499
Hello.
I'm Lisa.

73
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:24,464
I'm, um... Nick Leeson.
Can I help you?

74
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:27,061
Barings sent me to help
with the settlements.

75
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:28,705
Didn't they tell you?

76
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:34,180
Oh, of course! I've been on at them for so
long I never thought they'd get round to it.

77
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,575
What do we do with that lot?
Build a bonfire?

78
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:45,975
I'd never even heard of Barings
before I started working for 'em.

79
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:48,374
It's not like there's
a Barings in Watford.

80
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:52,060
You're a hero in London. They think
the sun shines out of your arse.

81
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:56,217
Really? I was beginning to feel like
one of those Japanese soldiers.

82
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:59,501
Still stuck out in the jungle
20 years after the war!

83
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:02,781
What's it like here?
They tell me it's not safe at night.

84
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,819
Bollocks.
The locals are great.

85
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:09,977
And it's not full of pompous ex-colonials
thinking they were born to rule the world.

86
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:11,894
That's what I love about Asia.

87
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:16,012
Anyone can make it. Doesn't
matter which school you went to.

88
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:19,697
When they told me I was going to
Jakarta I had to look it up on the map.

89
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,972
As a matter of fact, so did I.

90
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,093
I really want to be a trader.

91
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:29,139
If Barings don't let me on
the floor after this, I'm off.

92
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:33,054
- Not gonna be bloody clerking all my life.
- Ooh! Ambitious, aren't we?

93
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,051
- Is that bad?
- It's great.

94
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,971
I just want to get on in life.

95
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,019
I like to enjoy myself, don't get me wrong.
Work hard, play hard.

96
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,450
Well, I think this is me.

97
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,658
Well, night, Nick.
That was fun.

98
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,008
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

99
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,771
- OK. Night-night!
- See you tomorrow, then.

100
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:57,774
Lisa was a stunner all right.

101
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,814
Love at first sight.

102
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:03,207
Together we made short work
of the rest of those bonds.

103
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:07,575
Soon we cleared up most of Barings'
losses and it was time to go home.

104
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:09,375
See you later, Lisa.

105
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:11,492
Bye.

106
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,571
I think you'll agree that in Nick
Lisa has met her prince.

107
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:37,246
Hear!
Hear!

108
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:40,769
Join me in wishing them well
in their new life in Singapore,...

109
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:45,529
...where Nick is to be general manager of
the trading floor. Whatever that means.

110
00:07:45,613 --> 00:07:48,524
It impressed the hell
out of me, but...

111
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:49,886
And, um...

112
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:53,282
To you, Nick, I'm entrusting
the most precious of gifts.

113
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,205
I know you're gonna look after her
and cherish her...

114
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,851
...and all those other things.
And if you don't,...

115
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,001
...I'll break your bloody legs, all right?

116
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:05,404
He means it!

117
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:08,046
I love you so much, Lisa Leeson.

118
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,325
I love you too, Nick.

119
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,286
As a reward for Jakarta I'd been given the
far more important market of Singapore,...

120
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:24,884
...with a brief to set up my
own trading operation.

121
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,764
I was definitely on my way.

122
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:40,164
- And the kitchen...
- This is your department, darling.

123
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,238
Since when?
Cheeky!

124
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:45,718
And the bedroom...

125
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:03,398
- If you need anything, call me.
- Right, thanks.

126
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:05,440
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks. Bye.

127
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:07,515
Goodbye.

128
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:11,364
Not bad for a chancer
from Watford, eh?

129
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:14,799
Well, um... I think we should
test out that mattress, big boy.

130
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:16,874
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

131
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:23,514
Whoo!

132
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:44,718
I can't see any problem in you
handling both sides of the operation.

133
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
- At least until volumes increase.
- Right.

134
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,238
You shouldn't need more than two
on the trading floor.

135
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,231
A couple more in the back office.

136
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,150
No need to pay top dollar.

137
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,992
Get them young, get them hungry
and train them up.

138
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,630
- I'm a bottom line kind of guy, Nick.
- Absolutely. That's my philosophy.

139
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:05,156
I took him at his word.
My team were young, hungry...

140
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,956
...and they didn't have a clue.

141
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:11,828
A futures contract allows you to buy or
sell a specified amount of a commodity...

142
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,306
...at a specified price
at a future date.

143
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,628
Right.
Um...

144
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:24,232
It's like, if I agree to sell you this cup
of cappuccino, which I don't yet own,...

145
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:26,352
...at 45 cents a month from now...

146
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:30,634
If I can buy the cappuccino at,
say, 43 cents, I make a profit.

147
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:34,025
If the price goes the other way
I have to pay more, and I lose.

148
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:36,993
It's timing - buying and selling
at the right moment.

149
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:40,306
Sometimes espresso might be
the best deal, or salt, or pepper.

150
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:42,464
So, we're running a supermarket?

151
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:47,029
We're not buying and selling
anything real.

152
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:50,628
It's just numbers - contracts
based on the value of the Nikkei,...

153
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:52,431
...the Tokyo stock market.

154
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:55,869
- Er, we do this for the bank?
- No, no, for the customers.

155
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:58,911
We are not allowed to trade
on behalf of the bank.

156
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,426
Be sure you remember that, all right?

157
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:06,151
Other dealers wear red jackets.
All same. Red is lucky Chinese colour.

158
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:10,110
Well, we want to stand out. We're a
new operation. We need to be noticed.

159
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,147
May be bad luck.
Different colour.

160
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:14,142
Bollocks.
We make our own luck.

161
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,507
Nick's right.
We're cool dudes, man. Whoo!

162
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,987
Fernando.
Anything happening in Tokyo?

163
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,818
Nothin'.
How's SIMEX?

164
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,977
Same here.
No one's playin'.

165
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,057
590, and trading small.

166
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:04,943
600, and thin too.

167
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:11,380
580 here. There's a seller who wants
to trade in size. Shall I low-tick him?

168
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,057
Yeah.
Flush him out.

169
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,502
- Squeeze the sucker.
- How many?

170
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:17,903
200.

171
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:19,656
Buy them... now.

172
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,096
- Buy 'em!
- Filled!

173
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:25,021
We paid 580 for 200.

174
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:27,492
Way to go, Nick! I sold at 590.

175
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:30,691
Fuck a duck!
Just made 2,000 quid.

176
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,421
Yes!

177
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:42,134
They were a good bunch and
they were keen to learn.

178
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:47,494
It looked like a madhouse with
all the traders waving and shouting,...

179
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,459
...but it all made sense once
you got the hang of it.

180
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,613
There were hiccups, but that's
normal in any operation,...

181
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:56,373
...especially a new one like ours.

182
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,210
The important thing was we
were picking up the business...

183
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,291
...and the future looked rosy.

184
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:20,414
Nick, what's the difference between
initial margin and variation margin?

185
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:24,456
Initial margin's a down payment on
each futures contract that we trade.

186
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,812
We don't pay in full until
a contract matures.

187
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:30,572
But in the meantime the value of
each contract may go up or down.

188
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:33,807
So SIMEX calculate our positions
on a daily basis.

189
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:38,128
They'll ask for more money if the market
goes against us. That's variation margin.

190
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,605
Got it.
I think!

191
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:47,370
We need to open an errors account.
We've had a few mistakes.

192
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:50,572
I need somewhere to put them
till I can write them out.

193
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,248
Sure. What number shall I give it?

194
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:57,168
- Well, what's your lucky number?
- Eight. It is a very lucky Chinese number.

195
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,688
And how many numbers
do we need?

196
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:00,923
Five.

197
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:05,131
Then let's give it all the luck it can
handle. Call it the 88888 account.

198
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:32,726
And now it gives me great pleasure to
welcome the chairman of Barings Bank,...

199
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,041
...Peter Baring.

200
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:46,208
We may be the oldest merchant
bank in the world,...

201
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:50,247
...but that's no excuse for not
keeping up with the times.

202
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:52,284
When I became chairman,...

203
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:56,759
...I realised we couldn't go on running
Barings like a gentlemen's club.

204
00:14:56,848 --> 00:15:01,125
We had to look beyond our
traditional recruiting grounds,...

205
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:03,277
...the old school tie,...

206
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:06,439
...to seek out a new
and hungrier breed.

207
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,843
We're beginning to see the fruits
of those efforts, and I have to say,...

208
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:17,717
...the recovery in profitability, since
the reorganisation, has been... amazing.

209
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:22,435
To be frank, I've discovered it's
not actually terribly difficult...

210
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:25,244
...to make money in
the securities business!

211
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,632
Filled.

212
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:48,673
Yeah, you paid 50 for 20.

213
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,676
Come in.

214
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,597
Simon, er...
I've got a slight problem.

215
00:15:55,682 --> 00:16:00,118
One of the girls sold 20 contracts
for Fuji Bank instead of buying.

216
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,351
I can't do anything
about it till Monday.

217
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,920
What's the damage?

218
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,271
20,000 at the close.

219
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,953
Sack the cow. She'll never
work on SIMEX again.

220
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,510
That's a bit hard, isn't it?

221
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,635
Look, you handle it.

222
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:21,871
Have a word with London,
but make sure you make that client good.

223
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,748
All right.

224
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:32,474
Hey!
Have a beer, shithead!

225
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,991
Cheers.

226
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,988
Hi, darling.

227
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:38,272
Anyone seen Kim?

228
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:40,632
She was here a minute ago.

229
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:47,947
Kim...

230
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,832
Nick, Nick...

231
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,907
I'm really sorry. I got so confused.

232
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,987
- Everybody was shouting all at once.
- That's the job.

233
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:59,033
That's what it's all about,
keeping a cool head.

234
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:01,424
I'm so sorry! I'll pay
you back the money.

235
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:06,224
Sure, Kim. Four years' salary? And if
the market moves it could be even worse.

236
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,752
Come on, come on.

237
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,790
Come on,
everyone makes mistakes.

238
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:17,112
Look, with a bit of luck I can trade
out of it on Monday, all right?

239
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:22,264
Nick, I've been waiting for you while
everyone else is having a good time.

240
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:24,343
- I'm going home now.
- Kim!

241
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:27,982
Kim...!

242
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:36,545
- Everything all right?
- Never better.

243
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:42,467
Why don't you let me come in and help?
I can't sit around all day doing nothing.

244
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,541
It's not a problem, Lisa.

245
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,141
I can handle it.

246
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,583
Fernando, how are
March futures looking?

247
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,708
- I need 20 contracts at Friday's price.
- You won't get Friday's price!

248
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,825
I should have closed off the position
and taken the loss.

249
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:05,138
Instead, I waited for
the market to change.

250
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:07,662
It changed all right,
but not the way I wanted.

251
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:11,899
Now I was stuck with a bigger loss than
I could own up to. And it was all my fault.

252
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:14,979
Nick! I hear your girl
handed in her notice.

253
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:17,535
Never came back.
She couldn't stand the pace.

254
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,265
So much for loyalty!

255
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:23,305
- Did you make the client good?
- Of course. Made a small profit, actually.

256
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:25,377
Good man.

257
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:32,258
This one's for the
five eights account.

258
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,381
I bought the missing contracts.

259
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:35,818
60,000?

260
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:38,021
- Shh!
- It was only 20 before.

261
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:41,016
And the market went the wrong way.
I had to cut the loss.

262
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,060
What did Simon Jones say?

263
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,100
Are you serious?
He'd shut us down if he knew.

264
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:48,892
It'll be all right so long as we balance
the books by the end of the month.

265
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:51,019
- How? - We trade on
our own account...

266
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:55,176
...until we wipe out the losses, then
we use money from the client account...

267
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:57,651
...and pay it back with
next month's profits.

268
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,300
You mean, gamble?

269
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:03,214
Relax, Bonnie.
That's all the market is.

270
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,497
One giant casino!

271
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,179
George!

272
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:18,132
I was counting on nobody looking at
the books until the end of each month.

273
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,213
As long as the five eights account had a
nil balance on the last day of the month,...

274
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,098
...no one would suspect
that anything was wrong.

275
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,410
But instead of winning back the
position we made more losses,...

276
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:32,378
...and I had to borrow more money
from the client account to hide them.

277
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:45,969
Fuckin' hell, George, what are
you playing at? Get fuckin' out!

278
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:48,048
Get fuckin' out!
Now!

279
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:52,928
What the hell are you playing at?
Out! Get out!

280
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,967
Fuckin' hell!

281
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:02,568
- Agh. - God, you're tense.
Stiff as a board.

282
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:07,012
If you only knew! All cos those bastards
won't let me hire proper staff.

283
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:10,690
- I thought it was going so well.
- It is. It's going brilliant.

284
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:14,210
I just spend most of my life
covering everybody else's arse.

285
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:17,206
Well, why don't you let me
help with the back office?

286
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:19,683
- I'm bored being a
lady of leisure. - No.

287
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:24,005
Why not? It's ridiculous, you having
to handle trading and settlements.

288
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:26,004
You'll have a nervous breakdown.

289
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,482
I don't want you interfering.
I can handle it.

290
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:32,248
All right, keep your pants on!
No one's saying you can't.

291
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:37,244
I'm not going back to being a bloody clerk.
I'd rather be a plasterer.

292
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,089
My mum always used to say
I could be anything I wanted,...

293
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:44,924
...so long as I took my chances -
and worked like a dog.

294
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:48,287
Well, you have. You've worked
really hard and it paid off.

295
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:50,168
She'd have been so proud of you.

296
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:52,480
Do you really think so?

297
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,688
Yeah.

298
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,567
I know I am!

299
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,241
That was the worst part -
Lisa thinking I was this brilliant success.

300
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:09,286
If she only knew what a
fuck-up I really was!

301
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,802
When I wanted the market
to go up, it went down.

302
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,958
If I wanted it to go down,
it went up.

303
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:16,802
It was hard not to
take it personally.

304
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:27,726
Nick?

305
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:31,162
Nick! I just worked out the balance
in the eights account.

306
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:35,000
- The losses are over $10 million!
- Keep your fuckin' voice down!

307
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,077
Look, there's no need to panic.

308
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:42,636
There's not enough in the client account
to make margin payments, Nick.

309
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:47,437
Right.

310
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:54,522
I need dollars. I need dollars to
cover the initial margin payment!

311
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:59,873
I can get dollars from London to cover all
the client positions for the futures I buy!

312
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:03,672
Nothing unusual about that.
But I'm gonna need yen.

313
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:06,800
Gonna need yen to cover
the daily variation columns!

314
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:10,079
Which'll leave a yen deficit
by the end of the month.

315
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:13,435
Unless... unless I sell options.

316
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:16,231
That'll generate commission in yen.

317
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:20,920
And return the balance sheet
on the five eights account to zero!

318
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:28,112
As long as London kept sending out
money to finance the client positions,...

319
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,670
...I'd have enough cash to stay
on top of the margin payments.

320
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,874
It was like robbing
Peter to pay Paul,...

321
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,678
...but hopefully I'd end up making enough
to pay Peter back before he found out.

322
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,389
Meanwhile I had to generate more and
more business to justify my cash calls,...

323
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,628
...and for that I needed customers.

324
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:50,909
The bigger the better.

325
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:01,468
Mm-hm.
Oui.

326
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,353
Bon, tres bien.

327
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:07,154
Mr Leeson.

328
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:09,670
- I'm Pierre Beaumarchais.
- Nice to meet you.

329
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,987
I work for the Geneva Banking Trust,
based in the Bahamas.

330
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:17,065
I was speaking with Ang Swee Tian,
president of SIMEX.

331
00:23:17,155 --> 00:23:20,670
He's impressed by the amount of
business you've been generating.

332
00:23:20,755 --> 00:23:23,349
- There's a lot of opportunities
here. - Oh, yes.

333
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:26,385
I do a lot of business on SIMEX.

334
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:29,149
With the exception
of George Soros,...

335
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:32,146
...I probably trade in the Nikkei
more than anyone.

336
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:35,305
Sometimes over 5,000
contracts in a day.

337
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:38,829
That is a lot. The whole
market only does about 20.

338
00:23:40,113 --> 00:23:43,185
Could Barings handle
that amount of business?

339
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,588
You bet we could!

340
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:51,232
Beaumarchais was the
answer to my prayers.

341
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:53,872
I'd be able to siphon off
enough commission...

342
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:57,261
...to square the eights account
once and for all.

343
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,666
- Hello?
- Pierre Beaumarchais.

344
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:03,265
I want to buy 4,000
June contracts.

345
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,508
I've... got a price of 350,
but this'll move it.

346
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,104
Try not to pay more than 400.

347
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,022
We gotta get them cheap.
Beaumarchais is a big player.

348
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:15,703
If we pull this off,
we get a shitload of business.

349
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,349
- What's liquidity like?
- Tight as a flea's arse.

350
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,102
We'll get away with 500,
then the price will move up.

351
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:24,464
OK. But then we'll make the other
traders think we're sellers.

352
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,857
And when the price drops...
buy! All right?

353
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:28,540
OK.

354
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:39,503
Sell 250!

355
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:41,305
Sell 250!
Sell 250!

356
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:43,138
Sell 240!

357
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,740
Sell 240!
Sell 240!

358
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:53,300
Sell 200!
Sell 200!

359
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:59,654
- Buy 500 contracts!
- Sell 200!

360
00:25:00,745 --> 00:25:02,462
Buy? Buy?

361
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,502
Buy at 200! Buy at 200!
Buy at 210!

362
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,575
Buy at 210!
Buy at 220!

363
00:25:08,784 --> 00:25:10,978
Buy at 220!
Buy at 230!

364
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:14,581
Buy at 240!

365
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:16,654
Buy at 240!
Buy at 240!

366
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:21,940
Filled!

367
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:30,538
Nobody saw us coming! We swooped
on the first 1500 like a Stealth bomber!

368
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:32,452
4,000 contracts!

369
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:35,533
Balls of steel, Fat Boy.
Balls of fuckin' steel!

370
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:57,257
At last my luck had changed.
Suddenly I couldn't stop making money.

371
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:02,130
I was long in the Nikkei - that meant
gambling on it going up - and up it went.

372
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:05,209
Up and up and up.

373
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:13,171
That's very good!
Very good.

374
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,447
Serves you right, Lisa!

375
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:35,489
If it went all the way up to 19,000, I stood
to make a killing on the options I'd sold.

376
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:42,330
Come on, come on!
Come on, baby, you can do it. Come on.

377
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:45,964
- Yes!
- Yes!

378
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:53,363
Bonnie, we're on a fuckin' roll!

379
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:55,444
Yes!

380
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:58,328
Do you think we'll do it?

381
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:08,444
It's amazing!
You've made back all the losses.

382
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:12,763
- Over $10 million. - What did I tell you?
Oh, ye of little faith!

383
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:15,569
You keep doubling up,
and sooner or later...

384
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,686
...you're bound to win.

385
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,687
The Nikkei has closed up
for the third day in a row,...

386
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,205
...and the rally shows little sign
of running out of steam.

387
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:32,759
Analysts are predicting additional
gains in the days ahead.

388
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:43,923
- Happy?
- Yeah. Are you?

389
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:45,838
Never better.

390
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:52,686
I have been sailing a bit close to the wind.
I didn't want to worry you with it.

391
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:55,476
- What do you mean?
- No, it's all right.

392
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:59,081
The market turned round and a whole
load of my positions came good.

393
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,043
I made it all back.

394
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:03,116
What are you on about, Nick?

395
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:08,683
Don't get your knickers in a twist, but we
made mistakes and ran up some losses.

396
00:28:08,765 --> 00:28:11,154
I went out on a limb to
get back the position.

397
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:13,075
How big were the losses?

398
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,678
- It's about a million.
- A million quid?!

399
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:19,435
For God's sake, Nick!

400
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:23,794
No, it's all right. It paid off.
I squared it up.

401
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:26,314
I had to do it to protect the guys.

402
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:31,076
Promise me that you'll
never do that again.

403
00:28:31,162 --> 00:28:33,722
- It's not worth it, Nick.
- I promise.

404
00:28:35,522 --> 00:28:37,513
You will give me a heart attack.

405
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:45,074
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

406
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,871
Fuck off!

407
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,635
I really meant it. I was the number one
trader, and as the new year came in...

408
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:05,075
...I was determined to kick my
addiction to the eights account.

409
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,036
What will the market do?
Long-term?

410
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,791
No one thinks long-term,
they think nanoseconds!

411
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:12,551
- Long-term's tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow, then.

412
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:16,392
- That would be telling.
- Leeson speaks, the market moves!

413
00:29:16,478 --> 00:29:18,469
You said it, mate.

414
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:20,712
Pierre.

415
00:29:20,797 --> 00:29:25,109
I want to sell the 220 call options
and buy the 200 calls in December.

416
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,234
I've got an offer of
.138 for size.

417
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:30,193
Can you do better?

418
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:31,914
I'll get back to you.

419
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:34,590
Quick as you can, Nick.
I have to move fast.

420
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,307
Oui, oui, je suis toujours la.

421
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:41,274
What the hell is he on about,
.138 for size?

422
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:44,631
The market in 220 calls is down.
He wants to cut his losses.

423
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,388
- Yeah, but why .138?
- It's a ratio.

424
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:49,749
The 200 calls are
trading at 1,400.

425
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:53,713
Divide 200 by 1,400,
you get .143.

426
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,183
All right.
But not .138.

427
00:29:56,714 --> 00:30:00,626
Unless someone's offered him a discount.
Probably Societe Generale.

428
00:30:00,713 --> 00:30:03,466
We can't let those wankers
get our biggest client.

429
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,021
- What are you gonna do?
- Just have to leg it.

430
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:09,661
Buy the contracts from Pierre and
sell them when the market rises?

431
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:12,744
I thought we were not supposed
to trade for the bank.

432
00:30:12,832 --> 00:30:14,788
Pierre? I can do it.
What's the exact size?

433
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:17,590
6,500? All right, leave it with me.
No problem.

434
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:21,428
What if the market doesn't rise, uh?
What if it falls?

435
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:24,901
I've gambled and won before.
I can gamble and win again.

436
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:28,619
Balls of steel, me old mateys,
and you'd better believe it.

437
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:42,501
Bonnie, I need you to reopen
the eights account.

438
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,464
We got caned on
Beaumarchais' contracts.

439
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:48,824
Now the bastard's gone back
to Societe Generale.

440
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:53,186
Fax Brenda Granger in London. Ask her
for funds to cover the margin payments.

441
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,258
Tell her it's for client positions.

442
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:57,224
Hello?

443
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:59,423
It's Simon.
Can you come into my office?

444
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:00,986
Right away.

445
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:05,218
Christ, I'd been rumbled!
The only surprise was it'd taken so long.

446
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:08,378
What was I gonna tell Lisa?
She'd bloody murder me.

447
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,457
Come in.

448
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:18,057
Congratulations, Nick.

449
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:21,535
The '93 bonuses are in,
and you're down for 135 grand.

450
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:25,094
135?
That's fantastic!

451
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,895
Your little operation generated profits of
over 10 million last year. You're a star!

452
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:36,091
In fact, your figures are so high
they're going to check up on you.

453
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:38,060
Check up on me?

454
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:41,101
They're sending Ash Lewis out
for the audit.

455
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:45,260
Don't worry.
It's purely routine.

456
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:47,298
Ash Lewis?

457
00:31:47,382 --> 00:31:50,135
She's meant to be a right
ball-breaker, isn't she?

458
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,732
That's our booth.

459
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,497
Filled!
You paid 250.

460
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,411
Hi, Nick.

461
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,491
Ron Baker and Ash Lewis.

462
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,969
Ron is head of Derivatives Trading
in London.

463
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,095
Which I guess makes
me your boss, Nick.

464
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,012
- How do you, Mr Leeson?
- Very well, thank you.

465
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,169
OK
Let's see the action!

466
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:20,408
Henry!

467
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:23,888
Who's doing all the business?
We're the biggest, right?

468
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:26,890
We do a lot of arbitrage,
so we do have a high volume.

469
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,819
We signal orders in to George
in the pit - this is Henry -

470
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,167
...and at the end of the
day the girls in the office

471
00:32:32,356 --> 00:32:34,521
they log all the deals
on to the computer.

472
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:39,408
You manage the trading floor and
the settlements office, is that right?

473
00:32:39,497 --> 00:32:41,327
Yes, yes.

474
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:45,409
That's a little unusual. Whatever
happened to checks and balances?

475
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:49,408
- That's something we need to talk about.
- I'll be here for three weeks.

476
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:53,374
This is going to be a thoroughly
comprehensive audit. No stone unturned.

477
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:58,006
Absolutely. Anything I can do to help,
any stone needs turning, let me know.

478
00:32:58,095 --> 00:32:59,971
Are we filled?
Good man, Henry.

479
00:33:00,054 --> 00:33:01,851
Nice to see you, Simon.

480
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,848
Dad's seen this flat in Blackheath.

481
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:12,209
Needs a bit of work, but him
and my granddad can fix it up.

482
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:15,603
Think of it like an insurance policy
in case you get sacked,...

483
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:19,480
...have to go back to England
and work as a plasterer!

484
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:23,322
What's up with you, misery-guts?

485
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:28,644
What would you do, Lise?
What would you do if I did get the elbow?

486
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:31,609
You've just been given
a ruddy great big bonus.

487
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:35,650
But what if it all went wrong? What if
I'm not as clever as everyone thinks?

488
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:37,561
Oh, of course you are!

489
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,441
Anyway, it's you I love.
I don't give a toss about the money.

490
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:46,240
If it was up to me we'd jack it all in now,
go back to England and start a family.

491
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,359
You're doing brilliantly, Nick.

492
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:52,286
You're a bloody star.

493
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,078
- Nick!
- Fuck!

494
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,600
Simon!

495
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:12,600
- You're looking disgustingly chirpy.
- Haven't you heard? Panic over.

496
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,837
- Ash has been called back to London.
- You're kidding. Why?

497
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:19,965
Office politics. Some turf battle
between Futures and Securities.

498
00:34:20,046 --> 00:34:24,562
- And what about the audit?
- They'll send Mark Taylor and Chris Carr.

499
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,443
Compared to Ash they're
a couple of pussies.

500
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:32,838
Pity. I was rather looking forward to
seeing the dreaded Ash Lewis in action!

501
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,355
Yes!

502
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:42,360
No, I'm just leaving now.

503
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:46,118
I'm gonna jump in the shower.
If you get home first, put the oven on.

504
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:49,912
- All right, sweetheart. I'll see you then.
- Bye, darling.

505
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:58,596
- Get in, you bastard!
- What the fuck is that?

506
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:02,470
Sex on wheels.
It's a Porsche, moron! Get in!

507
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:07,717
I'll tell you what it is.

508
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:09,792
It's disgustin'.

509
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:13,317
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a great big hard-on!

510
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,519
Got to think of something
to do with my bonus.

511
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,194
You keep your eyes on the road,
you flash git!

512
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:27,915
Whoo!

513
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:30,797
- It's a fuckin' one-way
street, George. - Whoops!

514
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:37,226
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of steel!

515
00:35:43,597 --> 00:35:46,953
- Whoo!
- Fuckin' George!

516
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:54,986
Shit!
There's that Reuters journalist.

517
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,987
Nick! Nick!

518
00:35:57,076 --> 00:36:00,068
He's been bugging me for
weeks for an interview.

519
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:03,186
- Hey, Nick!
- All right, mate?

520
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,513
Nick, my man.
What'll you have?

521
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:11,109
Oh, a beer, please. You know
George Seow, one of my dealers?

522
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:13,549
This is Danny from
Intercontinental Trading.

523
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:17,786
- Just been sent from the London office.
- Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

524
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:21,502
I hear Barings have almost cornered
the market here, thanks to you.

525
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:24,027
The rumours have been
greatly exaggerated.

526
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:25,944
Don't be so modest.

527
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:30,981
He's king of the exchange! Barings got an
award for all the business he's generated.

528
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:33,222
- Do you want a beer?
- I'd love a beer.

529
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:37,465
Aagghh!

530
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,505
Watch the Drambuie settle.

531
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:02,025
And it's called depth charge.

532
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:05,021
It's guaranteed to blow
your fuckin' head off.

533
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,384
Are you ready?

534
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:10,618
Let's do it.
Let's have it.

535
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,027
One!

536
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:13,905
And two!

537
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:15,740
And three!

538
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:17,818
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

539
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:33,739
Hey! Pretty women!
What are you waiting for?

540
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:35,418
Come on!

541
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:38,096
- Come on!
- Tough shit, George.

542
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:40,574
Your charm's just not
working tonight.

543
00:37:40,665 --> 00:37:42,735
Stuck-up bitches!

544
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:48,103
- I bet they're Singapore air hostesses.
- Flight lieutenants, if you don't mind!

545
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:50,175
Chocks away!

546
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:52,975
Flight lieutenants...!

547
00:37:55,623 --> 00:38:00,538
Help 'em to decide if they wanna come
in or if they don't wanna come in.

548
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:02,693
Let's give 'em a hand
and moon 'em!

549
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:07,614
That should help 'em decide.
Come on, don't be shy!

550
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,852
Your mother wasn't!

551
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:11,819
I love this man.

552
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:13,654
- On three?
- It worked before.

553
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:15,493
It could work again.
One...

554
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:18,818
Two!
Three!

555
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:20,095
Bottoms up!

556
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,852
That is disgusting!

557
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,896
Whoo!

558
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,255
What'll it be,
you old bastard?

559
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,093
Absolutely brilliant, Nick!
Drinks are on me.

560
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,852
Enough depth charges
to sink a battleship!

561
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:43,208
- Fuck, what time is it?
- I don't know.

562
00:38:43,298 --> 00:38:45,732
Got to phone Lisa.

563
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,613
Oh, you've got to be jokin'!

564
00:38:55,697 --> 00:38:57,733
No laughing matter.

565
00:38:57,817 --> 00:39:02,128
Outraging a lady's modesty...
very serious crime in Singapore.

566
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:10,131
News of my disgrace reached London.
At the highest level.

567
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:15,534
It's slightly embarrassing,
but one of our traders got drunk...

568
00:39:15,615 --> 00:39:17,333
...and pulled a moon.

569
00:39:17,415 --> 00:39:19,292
What did you say?

570
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,046
He exposed his bottom.

571
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:25,368
- Why?
- Playing silly buggers, I expect.

572
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:29,003
Unfortunately, the law over there
takes rather a dim view.

573
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:31,004
Maybe we should sack him.

574
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:35,166
Sacking him would be...
awkward, to say the least.

575
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:39,451
He generates a significant amount
of our profits in Southeast Asia.

576
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:43,571
I, er... ought to mention we're getting
stick from the Bank of England...

577
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:45,529
...about our funding over there.

578
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:49,968
Technically we're in breach of regulations
on the ratio of lending to capital.

579
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:53,566
Would you like me to have
a quiet word in their ear?

580
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:55,607
Oh, we're not quite there yet.

581
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:59,365
When I spoke to Andy Dixon at the Bank,
he said the matter was...

582
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:02,522
..."buried reasonably
deep in his in-tray".

583
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,362
Just flagging a concern.

584
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,362
Quite right. It's something
we should keep an eye on.

585
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,485
Well... is that it?
Any other business?

586
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:14,120
Well, what about this chap Leeson?
He of the exhibitionist tendencies.

587
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:18,921
I suppose it's something we should
leave to the Singapore authorities.

588
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:22,318
I have to say...
I'm inclined to agree.

589
00:40:27,888 --> 00:40:30,526
So, it was the profits that saved me.

590
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:32,518
If they only knew!

591
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:36,162
Nick!

592
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:39,044
That guy from Reuters again.
The second time today.

593
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:41,117
Tell him I've...

594
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,197
Oh, fuck it!
Gimme the phone.

595
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:47,114
Print me up a balance
on the eights account.

596
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:48,399
Hi, Loy.

597
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:50,999
Nick! You're a hard
man to pin down.

598
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:53,360
You know how it is.
What can I do you for?

599
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:56,641
- Quite a position you've been buying.
- We're happy.

600
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:59,033
I don't know how the client
wants to play it.

601
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:02,912
Who is this mystery client, Nick?
He must have rather large balls.

602
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:06,518
I'm sorry, mate.
Client confidentiality and all that.

603
00:41:06,603 --> 00:41:08,594
Is it Pierre Beaumarchais?

604
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:14,032
Sorry, Loy, I... gotta go.
I'll speak to you later.

605
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:16,113
Speak to you some other time.

606
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,271
Jesus Christ, Bonnie.
It's 7.78 billion yen!

607
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:25,400
- Do you want the dollar amount? It's...
- Yeah, yeah, $77.8 million.

608
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:27,756
Book me the following notional trade.

609
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:33,154
Selling 1,000 December 21,500
put options at a price of... 7778.

610
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:37,074
Then print me a new report after that
entry so it shows 7.78 billion yen...

611
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,277
- ... as if it was owing to us
from SIMEX. - Sure, Nick.

612
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,957
Then fax Brenda Granger in London,
asking for more funds.

613
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,236
Say we've had a large margin call
on our client positions.

614
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:48,638
How much?

615
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,675
A million.

616
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,272
Make it two.

617
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:02,629
- Nick!
- Mm?

618
00:42:03,877 --> 00:42:05,868
Nick, it's the phone.

619
00:42:11,637 --> 00:42:14,833
- Hello?
- I'm not disturbing you, am I?

620
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:16,395
It's 2am.

621
00:42:16,476 --> 00:42:18,546
Oh, Christ. Sorry, mate.
Had no idea.

622
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:22,947
The old farts are getting nervous. They
want you to unwind the position a little.

623
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:27,313
That's easier said than done. Don't want
to send the wrong signal to the market.

624
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:28,350
Yeah, yeah.

625
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:32,712
Second, we need another 2 million profit
by next month to secure our bonuses.

626
00:42:32,794 --> 00:42:36,389
Two million? Ron, what planet
do you live on, mate?

627
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:39,113
One minute you want me
to unwind the positions...

628
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:41,150
Failure is not an option, mate.

629
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:44,270
See you at the junket in London
in three weeks' time.

630
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:50,548
2 million?

631
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,704
Who do they think I am,
George Soros?

632
00:42:56,712 --> 00:43:01,023
We were close to the end of another year
and I was deeper in the shit than ever.

633
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:05,104
Barings wanted me to speak at their
annual group conference in London.

634
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:09,309
I was their star trader, and they wanted
to know the secrets of my success.

635
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:11,381
It didn't bear thinking about.

636
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,503
- Is Nan staying with Auntie Karen?
- Yeah.

637
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,388
- It's the best place she could be.
- Aww, poor thing.

638
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:23,264
- Has she been crying?
- Mm.

639
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:25,021
Has she?

640
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:27,421
Hello?

641
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,258
Nick! It's for you.

642
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:32,339
Ron Baker.

643
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:42,303
Ron! Can't believe you
tracked me down already.

644
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:46,539
Listen, with this conference you'll be
away from the trading floor a long time.

645
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:49,459
I had to come back a week early
for this funeral.

646
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:53,505
- I told you, Lisa's granddad passed away.
- I'm sorry about that, mate,...

647
00:43:53,586 --> 00:43:57,340
...but I'm fighting for your bonus.
You need to keep up those profits.

648
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,542
- I couldn't miss this funeral.
- No one's asking you to!

649
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:04,777
I'll issue you a pass so you can come in
on Sunday and trade through the night.

650
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:06,821
You won't miss a thing!

651
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:09,054
Get out the fuckin' way!

652
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:14,174
If he's working this hard
he's going to need his food.

653
00:44:14,264 --> 00:44:17,539
He wants me to go into the office
on Sunday night and trade.

654
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:19,295
Well... no!

655
00:44:19,383 --> 00:44:22,978
That's completely out of order.
Let someone else make the profits!

656
00:44:23,063 --> 00:44:25,293
She's right, Nick.
You're not a machine.

657
00:44:25,383 --> 00:44:28,931
It's bonus time. If I don't deliver,
then everybody loses out.

658
00:44:29,022 --> 00:44:33,459
It's not fair, Nick. You carry on at this
rate, you're gonna be in a right old state.

659
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:35,180
It's gonna be your funeral next.

660
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:38,333
For as much as it hath
pleased almighty God...

661
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:40,981
...of his great mercy
to take unto himself...

662
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:43,780
...the soul of our dear brother
here departed,...

663
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:46,818
...we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

664
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,938
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,...

665
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,731
...dust to dust.

666
00:44:56,739 --> 00:45:00,175
Good to see you, son.
Sorry occasion, but there you go.

667
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:03,171
- He had a good innings.
- That's the main thing.

668
00:45:03,979 --> 00:45:05,889
So how's it going over there?

669
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:08,208
- Can't complain.
- We're all proud of you.

670
00:45:08,298 --> 00:45:10,528
- What you've achieved.
- It's no big deal.

671
00:45:10,618 --> 00:45:12,449
Don't be so bloody modest!

672
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:14,732
You a plasterer's son!

673
00:45:14,817 --> 00:45:17,854
I just wish your mum could
have been here to see it.

674
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:21,688
So do I.

675
00:45:22,217 --> 00:45:25,094
I'll try not to let
you all down, Dad.

676
00:45:25,176 --> 00:45:28,327
- What did you say?
- It's OK, it's just jet lag.

677
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:30,407
Don't pay any attention to me.

678
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,091
I felt sick going into the office,...

679
00:45:37,175 --> 00:45:40,167
...seeing all the people
I'd been avoiding for months.

680
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:45,282
It was one thing to con people over the
phone, quite another to do it to their face.

681
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:47,365
Nick?
That's you, isn't it?

682
00:45:48,334 --> 00:45:50,768
Nick Leeson?
I heard you were coming in.

683
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:55,044
You haven't the vaguest idea
who I am, have you?

684
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,439
Brenda?
Of course.

685
00:45:57,762 --> 00:46:01,768
- I'm sorry. How are you? - So I
finally get to put a face to the voice!

686
00:46:01,853 --> 00:46:05,640
- My God, you are so young!
- Well, ageing rapidly, I'm afraid.

687
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:10,089
Can you come into my office? I really do
need to talk to you about the figures.

688
00:46:10,172 --> 00:46:12,605
I'm meeting Peter Norris
in three minutes.

689
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:14,886
Oh. Well, do come
in right after, OK?

690
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:17,769
Nobody out there can answer
our questions but you.

691
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:21,048
And they just asked for
another ton of funding.

692
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:23,121
- All right. This one?
- Yeah.

693
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,926
Brenda was my cash lifeline.

694
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,366
She was the last person I wanted
asking awkward questions.

695
00:46:31,649 --> 00:46:34,117
But first I had to deal
with Peter Norris.

696
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:37,679
He's such a red-hot trader I'm
having him come in overnight!

697
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:39,407
Are you really?

698
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:43,925
You can't keep Nick away from the floor.
He's the key man in Singapore.

699
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:46,522
Sounds like you're
the key man in Asia.

700
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:49,247
He's insane! You should see
how he takes that market on.

701
00:46:49,328 --> 00:46:52,125
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Yes, it's all right.

702
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:54,198
"All right"?

703
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:02,320
Now, we need to talk about merging the
sales areas in Asia. Nick has some views.

704
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:05,796
If we can replicate his success
in Hong Kong and Tokyo...

705
00:47:06,766 --> 00:47:08,722
What do you think, Nick?

706
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:10,955
It does make a lot
of sense to merge.

707
00:47:11,805 --> 00:47:14,524
There would need to be
controls, of course,...

708
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:20,201
...but the trading books can be used to
supplement a customer's requirements...

709
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:22,593
...and increase information flows.

710
00:47:22,684 --> 00:47:24,720
Synergetically.

711
00:47:24,804 --> 00:47:26,635
Exactly.
Synergy.

712
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:28,839
So you see, Peter, Nick agrees.

713
00:47:28,923 --> 00:47:32,552
And he's been very successful
with his customers. They love him!

714
00:47:33,403 --> 00:47:36,122
Yes, excellent.
Well, keep up the good work,...

715
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:39,274
...and Ron, you sort out what
you want with this merger.

716
00:47:39,362 --> 00:47:41,432
Now, gentlemen, I really have to...

717
00:47:41,522 --> 00:47:44,275
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Cheers.

718
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:49,798
I think that went well.
He seemed to go for the merger idea.

719
00:47:49,881 --> 00:47:53,920
- Oh, he did. He really went for it!
- This'll be good for you too, Nick.

720
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:57,959
They'll give you some kind of
fancy new title!

721
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,031
Uh...
Nick!

722
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,512
Nick!

723
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,591
Ron!

724
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:11,712
Being good...

725
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:14,188
...is not good enough!

726
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:21,149
Everyone must be connected to
our strategy, or we will find you...

727
00:48:21,238 --> 00:48:23,308
...and weed you out!

728
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:28,827
Information arbitrage
is our business.

729
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:33,035
If you don't know what an
information curve is, then find out!

730
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:37,066
Position yourself in an
information curve.

731
00:48:37,836 --> 00:48:40,066
Dominate the curve!

732
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:44,866
Nick Leeson, who most of you know
and all of you have heard of,...

733
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,150
...runs our operation in Singapore,...

734
00:48:47,235 --> 00:48:49,908
...which I want all of
you to try to emulate.

735
00:48:50,835 --> 00:48:54,032
Now, you'll hear later from Nick
about how he does it,...

736
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:57,470
...but I just want to
drive home to you guys...

737
00:48:57,554 --> 00:49:00,671
...that if you could
all think about Nick...

738
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:04,905
...and perhaps come up with ideas
to follow his footsteps,...

739
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:07,507
...Barings will become...

740
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:12,986
...one of the most successful operations
in the derivatives business.

741
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:20,028
Oh, fuck!

742
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:24,504
Oh, we are gonna make
so much money!

743
00:49:25,711 --> 00:49:27,781
But more to the point,...

744
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:30,180
...you are gonna make...

745
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:31,340
...so...

746
00:49:31,431 --> 00:49:32,580
...much...

747
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,819
...money.

748
00:49:54,588 --> 00:49:56,579
Oh, Nick!

749
00:49:57,468 --> 00:49:59,379
Nick... wake up.

750
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:02,220
- Lisa... - We're meant to
be going to the dinner!

751
00:50:02,307 --> 00:50:05,265
I can't. I can't face it.
I can't take it any more.

752
00:50:05,347 --> 00:50:08,225
I'm not going back after Christmas.
You can't make me.

753
00:50:08,307 --> 00:50:11,423
What?! You're sitting next to
Peter Norris in the seat of honour!

754
00:50:11,506 --> 00:50:14,225
Don't tell me you missed
your presentation too.

755
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:17,378
- I've been drinkin'.
- I never would have guessed!

756
00:50:17,466 --> 00:50:20,582
I think it's downright rude.
You can't let everybody down.

757
00:50:20,665 --> 00:50:22,815
You don't understand, Lisa.

758
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:26,295
I'm sitting on a fuckin' volcano.
I can't go back!

759
00:50:26,385 --> 00:50:28,580
And what about your bonus?

760
00:50:28,665 --> 00:50:31,132
Now, stop babblin' and
get yourself dressed!

761
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:34,102
I'll give you volcano, Nick Leeson -
right up your bum!

762
00:50:34,184 --> 00:50:35,537
Lisa... oi!

763
00:50:35,624 --> 00:50:37,580
In you go!
You stink!

764
00:50:37,664 --> 00:50:40,541
Oh, Lisa...

765
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:45,214
You bitch!

766
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:50,261
- I'm gonna kill you now!
- Look at you! What a disgusting sight!

767
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:53,822
Aagh, no, you're gonna
get me all wet, Nick!

768
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:55,893
Oh!

769
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:04,739
Nick. You've got to
get dressed. Stop.

770
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:08,690
You've got to get dressed!

771
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,734
Promise me you'll
always love me, Lisa.

772
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:21,298
That whatever happens,
you'll always love me.

773
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:23,574
Oh, of course I will!

774
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:25,650
You're my man, aren't you?

775
00:51:33,538 --> 00:51:38,133
It was crazy going back. I couldn't hope
to survive the end-of-year audit.

776
00:51:38,217 --> 00:51:41,289
There was that little matter
of the 7.78 billion yen...

777
00:51:41,377 --> 00:51:45,052
...which I'd fabricated to plug the
hole in the five eights account.

778
00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:47,855
I should have told Lisa
when I had the chance,...

779
00:51:47,936 --> 00:51:49,847
...but this voice kept telling me...

780
00:51:49,936 --> 00:51:53,212
...I'd traded out of losses before -
I could trade out of them again.

781
00:51:54,616 --> 00:51:56,970
What's this letter all about?

782
00:51:59,175 --> 00:52:00,972
Well, it's from SIMEX.

783
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:04,252
Yes, I know it's from SIMEX.
It came while you were away.

784
00:52:04,335 --> 00:52:07,565
"It appears that you have
financed the trading positions...

785
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:09,610
...held by sub-account 88888. "

786
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:12,891
"If this is the case you have
violated SIMEX Rule 822,...

787
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:17,251
...which bans members from financing
the trading margins of their customers. "

788
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:20,609
They're just banging on about
our intra-day funding limits.

789
00:52:20,693 --> 00:52:22,763
Well, what is sub-account
88888 anyway?

790
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:26,208
It's a customer account.
We have umpteen trading accounts.

791
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:28,362
I'd have to look into it.

792
00:52:28,452 --> 00:52:32,001
We're the number one trader,
and they're tying us up in red tape.

793
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:34,730
Anyone would think they
didn't want us to trade.

794
00:52:34,811 --> 00:52:36,722
Er... I'll draft an answer for you.

795
00:52:36,811 --> 00:52:40,042
Yeah, do that, will you?
Get it on my desk by the morning.

796
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:42,520
Of course, Simon.

797
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,601
Lisa?

798
00:52:57,009 --> 00:52:58,567
Lisa?

799
00:53:07,648 --> 00:53:09,639
Lisa, what are you doing?

800
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:12,883
I'm bleeding, Nick!

801
00:53:19,087 --> 00:53:21,317
Why didn't you tell me?

802
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,397
Cos I was waiting till I was sure!

803
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:28,565
- You're not angry with me, are you?
- Of course I'm not angry, my love.

804
00:53:28,646 --> 00:53:31,796
- You want the baby, don't you?
- I really want the baby.

805
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:34,353
I want lots and lots
of babies. All right?

806
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:36,163
Yeah.

807
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:52,273
Your wife is OK...

808
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,354
I'm afraid she's lost the baby.

809
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:57,754
I'm sorry.

810
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:15,157
That was the turning point.

811
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:18,472
That was when I decided
I couldn't stand around any longer...

812
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:21,279
...hoping the market would
move in my favour.

813
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,157
I was gonna have to make it move.

814
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,509
I didn't care how much money it took.

815
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,670
I was gonna go for broke.

816
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:36,073
The man is single-handedly generating
a fifth of the group's worldwide profits!

817
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,549
I know. But $30 million in margin
payments? For one day's trading?

818
00:54:40,638 --> 00:54:43,869
You don't seem to understand.
The volumes are enormous!

819
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,313
Nick's guy is the biggest
player on SIMEX!

820
00:54:51,437 --> 00:54:52,995
- Hello?
- Nick.

821
00:54:53,077 --> 00:54:55,033
It's Brenda.

822
00:54:55,597 --> 00:54:59,430
Listen, buddy. This is putting
a terrible strain on our borrowing.

823
00:54:59,516 --> 00:55:02,349
Tony Hawes is all over me
about your cash calls.

824
00:55:02,436 --> 00:55:05,872
I hear you. But London is the
cash cow for the business here.

825
00:55:05,956 --> 00:55:08,549
We just don't have access
to any other funds.

826
00:55:10,955 --> 00:55:14,152
If you keep hassling me I've
a good mind to stop trading.

827
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:17,471
No, no, Nick. It's OK.
Listen...

828
00:55:17,554 --> 00:55:21,342
Just get back to me with
some meaningful figures, OK?

829
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,185
Fuck off.

830
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:32,546
Hello?

831
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:36,227
Thank goodness I caught you.
I know Brenda's giving you a hard time...

832
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:39,984
I don't think any of you understand
how it works out here.

833
00:55:40,072 --> 00:55:42,745
You may be right, mate.
Anyway, consider it sorted.

834
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:45,868
But you are gonna have to start
reducing these positions.

835
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:48,909
Well, Ron, I'll see
what I can do, all right?

836
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,380
While I've got you,
about your bonus...

837
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:56,100
The budget's tight. Though you've been
exceptional there's not much to go round.

838
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,181
I thought we had a record year!

839
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:02,741
Yeah. That said, I've put in a special plea
to Peter and he's agreed to go up to 350.

840
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,548
350? That's ridiculous!

841
00:56:04,629 --> 00:56:07,302
I'm really pushing out
the boat for you, mate.

842
00:56:07,389 --> 00:56:10,665
I'm busting my balls here.
I made us the top house in SIMEX.

843
00:56:10,749 --> 00:56:13,741
We even got that award for
all the business we're doing!

844
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,137
Yeah, I know that, Nick.

845
00:56:16,228 --> 00:56:18,219
Look, I'll see what I can do.

846
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:21,061
I'll see if it can't start
with a four, eh?

847
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:25,098
That was their opening offer.

848
00:56:25,187 --> 00:56:29,260
He'd have thought something was wrong
if I'd accepted it straight away.

849
00:56:29,347 --> 00:56:31,622
Yeah, it's like winning the lottery.

850
00:56:31,707 --> 00:56:33,697
They must think the world of you.

851
00:56:39,386 --> 00:56:41,502
What's the matter, Lisa?

852
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:44,304
What do you think's
the bloody matter, Nick?

853
00:56:44,385 --> 00:56:46,376
Everything's changed!

854
00:56:47,265 --> 00:56:50,541
I just wanna go home. Get the
hell out of here and go home.

855
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:53,696
But... you wanted to come back.
What about the bonus?

856
00:56:53,784 --> 00:56:56,537
Well, can't you get
the bonus in London?

857
00:56:56,624 --> 00:56:59,092
Please, Nick! I wanna
get on with my life.

858
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:02,698
I wanna start a family. I'm going
stir-crazy here all on my own!

859
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:07,937
Calm down. Look, I just need a bit more
time to sort things out, turn things around.

860
00:57:08,023 --> 00:57:12,618
No! You're up at dawn and then you come
back at night and collapse into bed...

861
00:57:12,702 --> 00:57:16,012
How am I meant to get pregnant again
if we never make love?

862
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:19,014
I know. But this could
set us up for life!

863
00:57:20,142 --> 00:57:24,817
- When's bonus day?
- 24th of February. Just five weeks to go.

864
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,461
Right, we're gonna
leave on the 25th.

865
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:30,816
I mean it. I'm calling the
furniture removers tomorrow.

866
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,891
All right.

867
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,731
All right.

868
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,857
With everything else closing in on me,
I'd forgotten about the mooning charge.

869
00:57:40,939 --> 00:57:44,329
When it finally came up,
I was facing a possible jail sentence.

870
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:54,411
The charge has been reduced
to a misdemeanour.

871
00:57:54,498 --> 00:57:58,650
The maximum penalty is a $200 fine.
I think we should plead guilty.

872
00:57:58,738 --> 00:58:00,693
Thank you very much.

873
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:03,610
It was uncanny.
I'd got away with it again!

874
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:08,213
To the Singapore legal system,
a shining example to the free world!

875
00:58:08,297 --> 00:58:10,890
We bared our all for Barings.

876
00:58:10,976 --> 00:58:13,854
Bearer bonds takes on a whole
new meaning after this!

877
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:18,452
Talk about a bear market!
Hello? Mooners Anonymous.

878
00:58:18,535 --> 00:58:21,447
This is Wei Wei from
Coopers & Lybrand. Is that Nick?

879
00:58:21,535 --> 00:58:22,968
Speaking.

880
00:58:23,055 --> 00:58:27,731
I'm compiling the end-of-year audit. There
seems to be a big hole in the accounts.

881
00:58:27,815 --> 00:58:30,328
I'm missing the 7.78 billion yen...

882
00:58:30,414 --> 00:58:32,405
...receivable from SIMEX.

883
00:58:36,694 --> 00:58:38,763
Nick, can you hear me?

884
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:41,321
Is everything all right?

885
00:58:41,933 --> 00:58:44,493
It's a little complicated.
What do you need?

886
00:58:44,573 --> 00:58:46,404
I can't find any paperwork.

887
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:51,487
It was an over-the-counter trade
between Speer, Leads and Kellagg...

888
00:58:51,572 --> 00:58:54,564
...and Barings London.
It fell through the computer system.

889
00:58:54,652 --> 00:58:56,767
I'll have a word with
the systems manager.

890
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:58,807
I need three bits of paper.

891
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:02,406
One: confirmation from SLK
that the 7.78 billion yen will be paid.

892
00:59:02,491 --> 00:59:05,642
Two: sight of your bank balance
to show it's been received.

893
00:59:05,731 --> 00:59:10,884
And three: a note from Ron Baker saying
he's aware of the deal and approves it.

894
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:16,000
Well?

895
00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:17,886
Oh, it's just a computer glitch.

896
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:20,529
They're doing their annual audit.

897
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:45,910
And so, with scissors and paste,
I created $78 million out of thin air.

898
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,589
This was forgery, pure and simple,...

899
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,709
...and there was no going back.

900
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,755
- Nick!
- Simon.

901
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,989
Jesus, you almost gave
me a heart attack!

902
01:00:57,079 --> 01:01:00,912
- What's this missing seven billion yen?
- Oh, that's a nightmare.

903
01:01:00,998 --> 01:01:03,558
It's an OTC trade that
was incorrectly booked.

904
01:01:03,638 --> 01:01:05,947
The auditors are really
on my case about it.

905
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:08,996
It's a pain in the arse,
but we've got to get it sorted.

906
01:01:09,078 --> 01:01:11,352
The point is, we're owed
the money by SLK.

907
01:01:11,437 --> 01:01:13,075
Who the hell are SLK?

908
01:01:13,157 --> 01:01:16,035
Speer, Leads and Kellagg.
It's a brokerage house.

909
01:01:16,117 --> 01:01:19,473
Better send me a memo as soon as.
Get these auditors off my back.

910
01:01:19,557 --> 01:01:21,945
Sure, Simon.
Don't worry, I'm onto it.

911
01:01:28,676 --> 01:01:32,224
Bonnie, it's Nick. Listen.
Listen very carefully.

912
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:37,912
Transfer 7.78 billion yen from the client
account to the house account tomorrow.

913
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,507
But it won't go!

914
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:41,391
There isn't enough money.

915
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:45,865
I know that, but then you can reverse it.
It's just an electronic transaction.

916
01:01:45,954 --> 01:01:48,865
But I want the transfer done.
And I want the bank...

917
01:01:48,953 --> 01:01:53,663
...to send us a fax of the statement,
showing the 7.78 billion yen credit.

918
01:01:55,513 --> 01:01:57,663
All right, Nick. If you say so.

919
01:01:57,753 --> 01:01:59,310
Cheers, Bonnie.

920
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:02,989
Nick?

921
01:02:03,072 --> 01:02:05,267
What's all this about
seven billion yen?

922
01:02:05,352 --> 01:02:08,309
Someone from London, Tony Hawes,
was looking for you.

923
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,940
Jesus Christ, if I hear any more
about this seven billion yen...

924
01:02:12,031 --> 01:02:14,147
It's about $70 million, innit?

925
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,108
What do you reckon?
Red or blue?

926
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,988
You think I just walked off
with $70 million?

927
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,469
I didn't say that.

928
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,506
It's a computer error.

929
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:27,538
You need someone in the back office,
I told you. You're not bloomin' Superman!

930
01:02:27,629 --> 01:02:29,267
Don't start all that again.

931
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:31,624
It wouldn't have happened
if I'd been there.

932
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:34,299
Right. I'm goin' out.

933
01:02:34,389 --> 01:02:36,663
- Where are you going?
- To get pissed.

934
01:02:36,748 --> 01:02:39,626
If anyone calls, tell 'em
I've gone to South America.

935
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:42,268
Well, you can bloody
stay there, then!

936
01:02:42,348 --> 01:02:44,339
Twat!

937
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:28,502
What have you done now, Leeson?

938
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,574
What have you done now?

939
01:03:49,061 --> 01:03:51,894
Come in.

940
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,858
I thought you'd like to know
the audit's been cleared.

941
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:04,818
- Nick sent the papers. Everyone's happy.
- Thanks, Ron.

942
01:04:04,899 --> 01:04:09,211
Technically we've breached SIMEX rules,
but it was just a non-transaction.

943
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:10,857
With any luck...

944
01:04:10,939 --> 01:04:15,409
...the auditors won't mention it, or we may
have problems with the local regulator.

945
01:04:15,498 --> 01:04:17,728
Sounds sensible.

946
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:22,811
Do you know, Nick made $10 million
doing arbitrage in a week?

947
01:04:22,897 --> 01:04:25,650
That's about...
half a billion dollars a year.

948
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,807
The guy's a turbo arbitrageur!

949
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:31,684
If he's doing that amount of business
for that amount of profit,...

950
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:35,405
...why don't we shut down the rest
of the bank? We're just overhead.

951
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,054
Yeah!

952
01:04:47,055 --> 01:04:49,125
- Hello?
- Nick,...

953
01:04:49,215 --> 01:04:52,047
...are you avoiding me?
I've been trying you for days.

954
01:04:52,134 --> 01:04:53,931
Sorry, Tony, it's been chaos.

955
01:04:54,014 --> 01:04:56,403
The audit went through.
I thought you knew.

956
01:04:56,494 --> 01:04:59,486
- It's this SLK thing.
- It's all been cleared up.

957
01:05:00,173 --> 01:05:04,769
I know. What's bothering me is where
you got all the money to actually...

958
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:06,809
...well, pay SLK in the first place.

959
01:05:06,893 --> 01:05:09,361
I mean, it's the equivalent
of $78 million!

960
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:11,443
It doesn't add up, you know.

961
01:05:12,652 --> 01:05:17,521
It's obvious. It's part of the funding we've
had from you over the past few weeks.

962
01:05:17,612 --> 01:05:18,647
Yes.

963
01:05:18,732 --> 01:05:22,121
So, the same figure
will flow back to you.

964
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:26,443
I see. You're saying that some of
the funding was used to pay SLK?

965
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:30,000
That's right, Tony. So we'll
be able to pay it back to you.

966
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:33,366
That'll be good. Er... getting
our funding down will be good.

967
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:35,680
I'm having to juggle
quite a few balls.

968
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,886
We all are, Tony.
Look, I've got to dash.

969
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,766
I've got company for dinner.

970
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:42,647
Of course.
Thanks, Nick.

971
01:05:42,729 --> 01:05:44,720
Thanks for... clearing that up.

972
01:05:51,328 --> 01:05:53,284
Yes, Ron.
What do you want?

973
01:05:53,368 --> 01:05:56,041
It's me, you wanker!
Danny.

974
01:05:56,128 --> 01:05:59,642
Bubble? What are you doing
calling me in the middle of the night?

975
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:01,604
Are you anywhere near a TV?

976
01:06:01,687 --> 01:06:03,882
I suggest you tune in to CNN.

977
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:11,963
The worst damage was in
the seaport of Kobe.

978
01:06:12,046 --> 01:06:14,355
Road and rail links are shattered...

979
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:18,077
Jesus, an earthquake!
That's all we fuckin' need.

980
01:06:19,485 --> 01:06:21,476
This is gonna kill the market, man.

981
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:24,398
The Nikkei's gonna fall
through the fuckin' floor!

982
01:06:24,485 --> 01:06:26,793
...milling around in search of help.

983
01:06:26,884 --> 01:06:30,001
Rescue operations are going
to be complicated, long...

984
01:06:30,084 --> 01:06:34,760
...and expensive. Mike Chinoy,
CNN, reporting live from Tokyo.

985
01:06:57,321 --> 01:07:01,155
Market's down 300 points, you stand
there cool as a fuckin' cucumber.

986
01:07:01,241 --> 01:07:03,311
The way I see it,
it's an opportunity.

987
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:07,632
I'm gonna buy into the market.
Buy it all the way back up to 19,000.

988
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,994
Oi!

989
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,516
Fuckin' true what they say
about your gonads, mate.

990
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,550
See what I mean?

991
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:24,154
Think I'll give Fernando a bell in Tokyo,
see what's shakin'. No pun intended.

992
01:07:24,238 --> 01:07:26,627
It's Nick.
What's the situation in Kobe?

993
01:07:26,718 --> 01:07:30,791
We've been trying to contact our friends,
but the lines are down.

994
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:32,788
Hold it a second.
We got movement.

995
01:07:32,877 --> 01:07:36,108
Holy shit, selling!
There's some selling!

996
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:38,953
Fuckin' hell, it's in free fall!

997
01:07:39,037 --> 01:07:41,028
I've never seen it move so fast.

998
01:07:42,157 --> 01:07:45,068
350! 350!

999
01:07:45,156 --> 01:07:46,475
350!

1000
01:07:57,955 --> 01:08:00,025
Nick?

1001
01:08:00,115 --> 01:08:02,105
Sure you don't want us to stay?

1002
01:08:03,634 --> 01:08:05,590
No, I... I'm fine.
You go.

1003
01:08:05,674 --> 01:08:07,744
You'll make it right, Nick.

1004
01:08:08,354 --> 01:08:10,231
We all believe in you.

1005
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:45,621
50 million!

1006
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:51,067
I,...

1007
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:53,458
...Nicholas Leeson,...

1008
01:08:53,549 --> 01:08:55,380
...have lost...

1009
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:57,460
...50 million quid...

1010
01:08:58,389 --> 01:09:00,379
...in one day!

1011
01:09:05,388 --> 01:09:07,344
What does he do, exactly?

1012
01:09:07,428 --> 01:09:09,895
That's what no one
seems able to explain.

1013
01:09:09,987 --> 01:09:13,696
It's simple. He switches contracts
between Osaka and SIMEX,...

1014
01:09:13,787 --> 01:09:17,063
...exploiting price differentials
between the two markets.

1015
01:09:17,147 --> 01:09:19,979
That's how he offers the best deals
to our customers.

1016
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:22,819
If it's that easy, why isn't
everybody doing it?

1017
01:09:22,906 --> 01:09:27,377
Because he's absolutely in the vortex
of the information curve over there.

1018
01:09:27,466 --> 01:09:30,377
He's discovered a whole
new way of making money.

1019
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:35,337
Well, he's giving us horrendous
funding problems, that's all I know.

1020
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:40,577
He doesn't do things by the book, Ron.
He just doesn't respect the rules.

1021
01:09:40,664 --> 01:09:44,373
Is he really the kind of person
we should be employing at Barings?

1022
01:09:44,464 --> 01:09:49,412
Oh, fuck the rules. It's barrow boys like
Nick who are turning the City around.

1023
01:09:49,503 --> 01:09:53,894
You can't run a modern financial centre
with a bunch of Hooray Henries.

1024
01:09:58,622 --> 01:10:00,021
Bastard!

1025
01:10:00,102 --> 01:10:02,093
Wakey-wakey!

1026
01:10:02,662 --> 01:10:05,017
- What's the action, mate?
- You tell me.

1027
01:10:05,102 --> 01:10:07,979
The market's up and down
like a tart's knickers.

1028
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:11,258
- I think the worst is over.
- Who knows? You could be right.

1029
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:13,297
Well, that's my hunch anyway.

1030
01:10:13,381 --> 01:10:15,974
Listen, I was out last
night with that Loy.

1031
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,096
You know, that journo from Reuters.

1032
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,694
He's convinced there's
no mystery customer.

1033
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,409
He reckons it's you. He thinks
you're trading on your own account.

1034
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,455
Without the bank's approval.

1035
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:30,775
Now, you're not that crazy, are you?

1036
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,736
What do you think?

1037
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:36,094
Who, then? Beaumarchais?
I thought he'd given you the elbow.

1038
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:39,329
- I can't tell you.
- Come on. It's me, Danny Boy!

1039
01:10:39,418 --> 01:10:42,728
I could tell you... but I'd
have to shoot you afterwards.

1040
01:10:45,817 --> 01:10:48,490
I know one thing.
If Customer X didn't exist,...

1041
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,613
...you'd have to invent him.

1042
01:10:52,737 --> 01:10:55,375
45 million? You've already
had 100 this week.

1043
01:10:55,456 --> 01:10:59,847
Everybody's had an advance margin call
from SIMEX on their client positions.

1044
01:10:59,936 --> 01:11:03,132
They're worried about stability
with these big movements.

1045
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:05,206
It's an emergency measure?

1046
01:11:06,335 --> 01:11:08,326
Isn't everybody squealing out there?

1047
01:11:08,415 --> 01:11:11,407
No, we'll get it back when
the market calms down.

1048
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:15,446
Nick, when are you gonna
reduce these positions?

1049
01:11:15,534 --> 01:11:17,923
The bean counters are freakin' out!

1050
01:11:18,014 --> 01:11:20,448
Ron! Didn't know you were there.

1051
01:11:20,534 --> 01:11:24,128
For fuck's sake, we've had the
Bank of International Settlements...

1052
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,773
...asking if Barings can meet
its margin payments!

1053
01:11:26,853 --> 01:11:30,562
- It is not good for the image!
- I hear you, Ron. It's a tight market.

1054
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,847
Yeah, well,
you've really gotta try.

1055
01:11:32,932 --> 01:11:34,923
Take a hit on it if you have to.

1056
01:11:35,012 --> 01:11:39,290
I know Norris is gonna want to discuss it
with you when he's out there next week.

1057
01:11:39,372 --> 01:11:41,044
Norris?

1058
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:44,769
- I didn't know he was coming.
- Yeah, with Tony Hawes.

1059
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:49,163
They want to check the numbers. Iron out
these funding problems once and for all!

1060
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:58,728
There was no way I could reduce my
positions without the market collapsing.

1061
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:03,519
By the time they got to Singapore I was in
deeper than ever, faxing Brenda daily,...

1062
01:12:03,609 --> 01:12:06,362
...30, 40 million
dollars at a time.

1063
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:09,600
They were gonna kill me.

1064
01:12:32,326 --> 01:12:34,317
Lookin' like shit, Nick.

1065
01:12:35,886 --> 01:12:37,956
Lookin' like fuckin' shit, mate.

1066
01:12:45,645 --> 01:12:47,875
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1067
01:12:54,364 --> 01:12:57,561
His approach shot
sliced into the woods...

1068
01:12:58,643 --> 01:13:01,953
- Nick. There you are.
- I'm sorry I'm a little bit late.

1069
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,762
- What'll you have?
- A beer would be great, thanks.

1070
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:06,834
Another Tiger, please.

1071
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:09,273
Nick...

1072
01:13:10,642 --> 01:13:13,918
- How was the market today?
- It stayed between 18,000 and 18,300.

1073
01:13:14,002 --> 01:13:15,993
It's settled after the earthquake.

1074
01:13:16,082 --> 01:13:18,356
Happy with the positions
you're running?

1075
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:21,831
I'm relaxed. They're March contracts,
so I'll let them expire.

1076
01:13:21,921 --> 01:13:23,639
- Good.
- Thanks.

1077
01:13:25,481 --> 01:13:28,677
Now, we've had a lot of stick...
over funding.

1078
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,038
Brenda Granger tells me we're borrowing
all over Japan to get the funds to you.

1079
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,315
People are beginning to talk, Nick.

1080
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,515
I understand.

1081
01:13:37,599 --> 01:13:39,430
I understand completely.

1082
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,591
Excellent.

1083
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,670
Good man.

1084
01:13:45,479 --> 01:13:49,437
And that was it. That was apparently
all he had to say on the subject...

1085
01:13:49,518 --> 01:13:54,114
...of my enormous exposure causing
so many ulcers throughout Barings.

1086
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:56,950
Better than you get in London,
that's for sure!

1087
01:13:57,037 --> 01:13:58,914
You'll enjoy the next course.

1088
01:13:58,997 --> 01:14:01,989
- Lobster, sir?
- No, thanks. I'm not very hungry.

1089
01:14:02,077 --> 01:14:04,715
I should have been able
to relax after that,...

1090
01:14:04,796 --> 01:14:09,153
...but I couldn't stop thinking about
the losses in the five eights account.

1091
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,750
Shame you can't stay for
the match on Saturday.

1092
01:14:16,715 --> 01:14:18,706
You're down for 450, aren't you?

1093
01:14:20,715 --> 01:14:22,785
Your bonus.

1094
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,910
Only a week to go.

1095
01:14:26,514 --> 01:14:27,947
Sorry?

1096
01:14:28,034 --> 01:14:32,550
Have you thought about what you're
going to do with it? Only a week to go!

1097
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:40,065
Ahem! Excuse me. I have
an announcement to make.

1098
01:14:42,753 --> 01:14:46,665
I know that some of you are worried
about our exposure in the market,...

1099
01:14:46,752 --> 01:14:51,667
...and you're probably wondering about
the identity of our mystery Customer X.

1100
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:54,860
Well, the fact is...

1101
01:14:54,951 --> 01:14:56,942
...he doesn't exist.

1102
01:14:57,711 --> 01:14:59,941
We are the customer: Barings.

1103
01:15:00,031 --> 01:15:02,544
Look properly at
the five eights account -

1104
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:05,906
...which is not a client account,
it's an errors account -

1105
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:10,541
...and you'll realise it's concealing
losses in the region of 200 million.

1106
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:15,188
No, I tell a lie.
It's more like 230 after today!

1107
01:15:26,148 --> 01:15:29,185
What are you going to do
with all that money, Nick?

1108
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:39,021
Well, I won't spend it
on futures and options!

1109
01:15:42,986 --> 01:15:44,942
- That's very good.
- Very good.

1110
01:15:51,825 --> 01:15:54,862
I was living from day to day,
hoping for a miracle.

1111
01:15:56,505 --> 01:16:00,383
I wasn't running a position any more.
The position was running me.

1112
01:16:01,984 --> 01:16:05,101
Man, look at the state you're in.
You got the bloody shakes!

1113
01:16:05,184 --> 01:16:07,823
- You been on the razz all night?
- Nah.

1114
01:16:07,904 --> 01:16:11,054
- I'm just getting killed by the market.
- Tell me about it!

1115
01:16:11,143 --> 01:16:13,134
I've had a shitty week too.

1116
01:16:15,663 --> 01:16:17,654
Penguin?
You lucky sod!

1117
01:16:18,423 --> 01:16:20,378
Do you know how rare they are?

1118
01:16:20,462 --> 01:16:22,453
Do you know?

1119
01:16:26,622 --> 01:16:29,693
- It ain't that bloody funny!
- Lucky Leeson!

1120
01:16:29,781 --> 01:16:32,534
You have it. I'm not
laughing at you, Bubble.

1121
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:36,372
Fuck! Sorry.

1122
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:41,296
'Ey-ey-ey-ey-ey! You really
are in a bad way, ain't ya?

1123
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,931
What's the matter?

1124
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,649
I have an unauthorised position.

1125
01:16:52,819 --> 01:16:54,810
Fuckin' hell.

1126
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,217
How big?

1127
01:16:58,298 --> 01:17:00,289
Big enough to be a problem.

1128
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:03,490
Poor bastard!

1129
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:06,410
I can't say it comes as
a complete surprise.

1130
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,727
- Does Lisa know?
- No, she'd kill me.

1131
01:17:09,617 --> 01:17:14,133
She's got enough on her plate. She's just
waiting for my bonus so we can go home!

1132
01:17:14,217 --> 01:17:16,207
So what are you gonna do?

1133
01:17:17,896 --> 01:17:22,253
Well... I just have to keep buying
futures to support the market.

1134
01:17:22,336 --> 01:17:25,219
If it sticks at 18,000,
my options are still in the money...

1135
01:17:25,545 --> 01:17:27,416
I could get the position back.

1136
01:17:27,575 --> 01:17:30,294
- I may even come out ahead.
- Nick...

1137
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,331
You listen to me now, right.

1138
01:17:32,415 --> 01:17:34,406
You don't fight the market, man.

1139
01:17:34,495 --> 01:17:38,806
Even if you can make the margin calls,
what happens when the contracts expire?

1140
01:17:38,894 --> 01:17:42,523
The way the market's going,
your losses could be catastrophic!

1141
01:18:07,691 --> 01:18:10,410
Five for a thousand,
five for a thousand! Come on!

1142
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:14,563
George, move this fuckin' market!
If it stays below 18,000 we're dead!

1143
01:18:23,969 --> 01:18:25,960
Come on!

1144
01:18:43,007 --> 01:18:43,996
Nick.

1145
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:47,836
- Nick!
- Tony.

1146
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:51,397
Nick, I really need to go over
some of the figures with you.

1147
01:18:51,486 --> 01:18:53,477
Sure, Tony.

1148
01:18:57,406 --> 01:18:59,044
Back in a minute.

1149
01:19:02,725 --> 01:19:04,716
Seven for five!
Seven for five!

1150
01:19:11,924 --> 01:19:13,642
I'm sorry. Money!

1151
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:04,352
I'd thrown away countless more millions,
and it hadn't made a dent.

1152
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:07,953
I was only one day from bonus day,
but the game was up.

1153
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:11,509
I was beaten.

1154
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:51,507
Oh, Nick, you're a
bloody fool, aren't you?

1155
01:20:52,874 --> 01:20:57,344
Well, it's not the end of the world.
You've got your health, you've got me...

1156
01:20:57,433 --> 01:20:59,389
Shame about the bonus.

1157
01:20:59,473 --> 01:21:01,464
Sorry.

1158
01:21:02,073 --> 01:21:04,428
Slow down.
The video shop's on the next left.

1159
01:21:04,513 --> 01:21:06,662
- I wanna get our deposit back.
- Right.

1160
01:21:06,752 --> 01:21:08,902
We're gonna need it, darlin'.

1161
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:26,662
- Hello?
- The positions have got bigger!

1162
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:30,106
If they aren't reduced
I'm coming out there to sort you out!

1163
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:33,307
- You're very faint, Ron.
- And what's this rumour I hear?

1164
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:35,698
There's a rumour that
we're the customer.

1165
01:21:35,789 --> 01:21:37,859
Sorry, you're gonna
have to speak up.

1166
01:21:37,949 --> 01:21:40,224
Tell me we're not
the customer, Nick.

1167
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:43,381
- I'm losing you, Ron.
- Nick! Nick, are you there?

1168
01:21:43,468 --> 01:21:45,459
Goodbye, Ron.

1169
01:21:48,628 --> 01:21:51,859
They wouldn't give me the full 200,
but I stood my ground and got 180.

1170
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:53,938
Good girl.

1171
01:21:58,067 --> 01:21:59,659
Nick...!

1172
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:30,378
Excuse me, sir.
There's a phone call for you.

1173
01:22:30,464 --> 01:22:33,455
- Not now. - It's Peter Norris.
He said it's urgent.

1174
01:22:33,543 --> 01:22:35,101
Oh. Thank you.

1175
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:37,014
Would you excuse me?

1176
01:22:47,382 --> 01:22:48,701
Peter?

1177
01:22:48,782 --> 01:22:51,818
I'm sorry to drag you away
from your dinner party.

1178
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:55,540
I'm afraid I've got some
rather bad news.

1179
01:22:57,821 --> 01:23:02,291
By the time the shit hit the proverbial fan
in London we'd escaped Singapore...

1180
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,338
...to ponder the future
and consider my options.

1181
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,297
If I had any.

1182
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:10,250
What's gonna happen, Nick?

1183
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:14,813
They must have got my fax and
closed down all the positions on Friday.

1184
01:23:14,899 --> 01:23:17,015
The market seems to
be holding up OK.

1185
01:23:17,099 --> 01:23:19,248
But you're definitely out of a job?

1186
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:26,297
It could have been a lot worse,
but I still lost them a ton of money.

1187
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:30,566
I'm starving! Think they
do burgers here?

1188
01:23:30,657 --> 01:23:32,932
No! You're not having a burger.

1189
01:23:33,017 --> 01:23:36,771
- That tummy of yours is driving me nuts.
- Don't stress me, wench!

1190
01:23:38,496 --> 01:23:40,487
I'll work it off in the gym.

1191
01:23:43,296 --> 01:23:45,287
Better still...

1192
01:23:51,335 --> 01:23:55,294
- Stop it. People are watching.
- So? I don't care. Come here, girl.

1193
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:01,973
Jesus Christ, Lisa!

1194
01:24:03,814 --> 01:24:06,169
- Barings has gone bust!
- What?!

1195
01:24:08,453 --> 01:24:11,445
The Chancellor of the Exchequer
is trying to calm fears...

1196
01:24:11,533 --> 01:24:15,321
...sparked by the failure of Barings Bank.
In a statement to Parliament...

1197
01:24:15,413 --> 01:24:19,121
...he denied reports that the British
banking system is about to collapse.

1198
01:24:19,212 --> 01:24:23,046
According to him, Barings'
failure is a unique situation,...

1199
01:24:23,132 --> 01:24:26,840
...which he blames on the actions
of a rogue trader in Singapore.

1200
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:32,403
Estimates of potential losses range from
800 million to over one billion pounds.

1201
01:24:32,491 --> 01:24:36,608
There's no way of knowing how markets
will react when they reopen on Monday.

1202
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:40,080
As the Bank of England tries to
put together a rescue package,...

1203
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:44,607
...with the Sultan of Brunei rumoured
as a buyer, time may be running out...

1204
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:48,204
...for one of Britain's most
venerable financial institutions.

1205
01:24:48,289 --> 01:24:50,564
Charles Samson, CNN, London.

1206
01:24:50,649 --> 01:24:52,640
Fuck!

1207
01:24:53,609 --> 01:24:55,485
Oh, Nick!

1208
01:25:01,168 --> 01:25:03,124
How could you not tell me?

1209
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:06,836
How could you have kept it hidden
for all this time, Nick?

1210
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:11,123
You must have been through hell!

1211
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:14,482
You would have marched me
straight into Simon Jones's office.

1212
01:25:14,566 --> 01:25:17,000
- Too bloody right!
- Then I'd have got fired,...

1213
01:25:17,086 --> 01:25:20,522
...and I couldn't have made the money
back. That's all I was gonna do.

1214
01:25:20,606 --> 01:25:22,801
No, but you were gambling.

1215
01:25:22,886 --> 01:25:26,321
That's what you were doing.
With other people's money.

1216
01:25:27,565 --> 01:25:29,715
I didn't want to let everyone down.

1217
01:25:31,405 --> 01:25:34,521
You, my dad, the girls in the office...

1218
01:25:37,364 --> 01:25:39,355
Even Ron bloody Baker!

1219
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:45,522
Do you think they're all
gonna hate me now?

1220
01:25:45,603 --> 01:25:48,515
Well, I don't think you're
gonna be Mr Popular!

1221
01:25:51,883 --> 01:25:54,396
It could easily have been
the other way, you know.

1222
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:57,433
It so nearly was.

1223
01:25:59,002 --> 01:26:00,993
Then I'd be a hero.

1224
01:26:03,001 --> 01:26:04,912
Oh...!

1225
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:07,071
Come here.
Come here.

1226
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,071
I still love ya. Mm?

1227
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,637
- I love you very much.
- I love you too.

1228
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,034
Shall we see if I can do
something about that belly?

1229
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:31,109
I see.

1230
01:26:32,398 --> 01:26:34,229
Yes, I understand.

1231
01:26:34,318 --> 01:26:36,434
No, of course.

1232
01:26:37,118 --> 01:26:39,313
Thank you again for your efforts.

1233
01:26:39,398 --> 01:26:40,796
Goodbye.

1234
01:26:43,557 --> 01:26:47,470
That was the Sultan of Brunei's office.
They have decided not to proceed.

1235
01:26:47,557 --> 01:26:51,868
They believe the risks are too great and
the time too short, in view of the need...

1236
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:56,393
...to have a rescue package ready by the
time markets open again in the Far East.

1237
01:26:56,476 --> 01:26:58,467
Is there really no one else?

1238
01:26:59,115 --> 01:27:01,504
We've tried everyone.
It's hopeless.

1239
01:27:03,835 --> 01:27:07,714
I therefore have to inform you
that Barings is insolvent...

1240
01:27:07,795 --> 01:27:10,467
.,.and will go into
immediate liquidation.

1241
01:27:16,994 --> 01:27:21,145
Peter Barings has gone on TV
and said there's been a conspiracy.

1242
01:27:21,233 --> 01:27:22,951
They've lost 800 million quid!

1243
01:27:23,033 --> 01:27:25,501
I lost nowhere near that.
It was more like 300!

1244
01:27:25,593 --> 01:27:29,983
But Barings didn't do anything Friday.
Now the word's out, the market's crashed.

1245
01:27:30,072 --> 01:27:31,585
Bloody idiots!

1246
01:27:31,672 --> 01:27:33,663
They think you've run
off on your yacht.

1247
01:27:33,752 --> 01:27:35,788
- What?!
- I know. But listen, mate.

1248
01:27:35,872 --> 01:27:39,307
You've got no friends here now,
so just get the fuck out of Asia.

1249
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:42,144
Get back to London, Australia, anywhere.
Just get out.

1250
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:43,789
We're tryin'.

1251
01:27:43,871 --> 01:27:47,226
Oi, Nick... get yourself
a good lawyer.

1252
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:49,301
- Be lucky.
- Cheers, mate.

1253
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,180
Flight 187 to Hong Kong...

1254
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,261
...leaving from gate two.

1255
01:27:56,669 --> 01:27:57,897
Fuck!

1256
01:28:05,429 --> 01:28:09,865
There's a manhunt all over Asia. They
think we're sailing around in our yacht!

1257
01:28:09,948 --> 01:28:13,497
- What bloody yacht?
- I know. What about the flights?

1258
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:16,704
- There's one to London. Via Singapore.
- That's no good.

1259
01:28:16,787 --> 01:28:19,460
There's a flight to Frankfurt.
Via Abu Dhabi.

1260
01:28:19,547 --> 01:28:21,105
Let's take it.

1261
01:28:21,187 --> 01:28:22,859
And Lisa...

1262
01:28:22,947 --> 01:28:24,937
Pay cash.

1263
01:29:13,421 --> 01:29:15,537
- Newspaper, sir?
- No, thank you.

1264
01:29:15,621 --> 01:29:17,612
- Ma'am?
- Er... no, thanks.

1265
01:29:21,061 --> 01:29:23,096
Nick, take that thing off.

1266
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:26,092
There's a guy over
there lookin' at me.

1267
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:28,648
I'm not surprised,
with that bloody hat on!

1268
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:33,130
Talk about conspicuous! You're
sticking out like a sore bloody thumb.

1269
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:36,734
Did you say we stop at Abu Dhabi?

1270
01:29:36,819 --> 01:29:39,049
Yeah.

1271
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:43,177
- That's where they cut your hands off.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous!

1272
01:29:44,018 --> 01:29:46,009
They just stone you.

1273
01:29:47,138 --> 01:29:49,368
What?

1274
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:51,607
I'm sorry, but you've gotta laugh!

1275
01:29:53,777 --> 01:29:58,567
Poor old Barings, eh? That's what you get
for hiring the wrong sort of person.

1276
01:30:12,735 --> 01:30:15,203
That was when it hit me -

1277
01:30:15,295 --> 01:30:17,286
...the enormity of what I'd done.

1278
01:30:18,135 --> 01:30:21,968
Whatever happened, I knew things
were never gonna be the same again.

1279
01:30:22,054 --> 01:30:24,727
And I've never felt
lonelier in all my life.

1280
01:30:33,813 --> 01:30:36,043
I love you, Lisa.

1281
01:30:36,133 --> 01:30:38,124
Whatever happens, I love you.

1282
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,763
I love you too.

1283
01:30:41,732 --> 01:30:43,723
I've got to get back to London.

1284
01:30:44,452 --> 01:30:49,764
I couldn't stand being in jail in Singapore.
I couldn't stand it if I couldn't see you.

1285
01:30:54,851 --> 01:30:56,842
Jesus Christ, it's the police!

1286
01:30:56,931 --> 01:30:58,966
They must know I'm on the flight.

1287
01:30:59,050 --> 01:31:01,280
Well... no, not necessarily.

1288
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:07,687
Due to our early arrival, passport control
will take place as you leave the plane.

1289
01:31:07,769 --> 01:31:09,839
Please have your documents ready.

1290
01:31:11,329 --> 01:31:12,444
See?

1291
01:31:16,009 --> 01:31:17,999
I'm scared, Lisa!

1292
01:31:19,568 --> 01:31:21,559
You be strong, OK?

1293
01:31:29,727 --> 01:31:31,126
Danke.

1294
01:31:32,207 --> 01:31:33,925
Pass, bitte.

1295
01:31:34,007 --> 01:31:36,679
Danke. Thank you.

1296
01:31:38,566 --> 01:31:40,557
Please show your passport.

1297
01:31:43,726 --> 01:31:45,603
Where is your man?

1298
01:31:47,525 --> 01:31:49,516
I'm her man.

1299
01:32:10,843 --> 01:32:14,040
250 bid on 100! 250
bid on 100! Come on!

1300
01:32:14,123 --> 01:32:17,956
Who wants some of that? 250 bid
on 100! 250 bid on 100! Come on!

1301
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,276
And that's it, more or less.
That's the end of my story.

1302
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:46,309
Barings was eventually sold to the Dutch
bank ING for the princely sum of 1.

1303
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,234
Lisa's got a new life as a flight
attendant for Virgin Atlantic.

1304
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:54,513
I hear she's got herself a new fella.

1305
01:32:56,318 --> 01:33:00,027
As for me, I fought unsuccessfully
against extradition...

1306
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:05,111
...from Frankfurt to Singapore on charges
of fraud, forgery and breach of trust.

1307
01:33:07,237 --> 01:33:10,229
I was sentenced to six and
a half years in prison.

1308
01:33:11,117 --> 01:33:14,711
Despite rumours of secret bank
accounts and hidden millions,...

1309
01:33:14,796 --> 01:33:18,311
...I did not profit personally
from my unlawful trading.

1310
01:33:19,756 --> 01:33:22,110
To be absolutely honest,...

1311
01:33:22,195 --> 01:33:24,186
...sometimes I wish I had.

1312
01:33:56,192 --> 01:34:01,982
# I've got something to say

1313
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:09,688
# We...

1314
01:34:10,339 --> 01:34:13,255
# have come a long way

1315
01:34:17,670 --> 01:34:21,576
# After all the things that

1316
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:25,343
# We have been through

1317
01:34:27,949 --> 01:34:33,545
# I'm glad still to have you

1318
01:34:38,707 --> 01:34:43,383
# I know you're hurtin'

1319
01:34:43,467 --> 01:34:48,540
# And though you're hurtin'

1320
01:34:48,626 --> 01:34:53,495
# It will get better every day

1321
01:34:58,145 --> 01:35:04,141
# I love all that you are

1322
01:35:08,344 --> 01:35:14,340
# You are what I live for

1323
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:22,569
# After all the things that

1324
01:35:22,616 --> 01:35:26,268
# That we have been through

1325
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:31,698
# I'm...

1326
01:35:32,016 --> 01:35:35,312
# glad still to have you

1327
01:35:39,381 --> 01:35:44,171
# I know you're hurtin'

1328
01:35:44,261 --> 01:35:49,254
# And though you're hurtin'

1329
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:54,493
# It will get better every day

1330
01:35:55,719 --> 01:36:01,314
