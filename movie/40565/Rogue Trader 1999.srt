both sides of the operation right you

to pay top dollar get them young get

145
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,390
them hungry and train them up I'm a

146
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,010
bottom line kind of guy Nick yeah

147
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,760
absolutely I mean that's my philosophy I

148
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,470
took him at his word my team are young

149
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,960
they were hungry and they didn't have a

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,820
clue a futures contract is an agreement

151
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,280
to buy or sell a specified amount of a

152
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,320
commodity at a specified price at a

153
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:24,510
future date it's like if I agreed to

154
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,370
sell you this cup of cappuccino which I

155
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,860
don't yet at forty five cents and months

156
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,810
from now if I can buy the cappuccino I

157
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,960
say forty three cents I make a profit if

158
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,550
the price goes the other way I have to

159
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,460
pay more and I loathe its timing is

160
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,620
buying and selling at the right moment

161
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,180
sometimes expresso might be the best

162
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,880
deal or salt or pepper so the truth of

163
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,230
the matter is we're not buying and

164
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,330
selling anything real it's just numbers

165
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,250
in our case contracts replacing the

166
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,960
value of the nikkei the tokyo stock

167
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,690
market we do this for the bank no no we

168
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,790
do this for the customers we are not

169
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,760
allowed to trade on behalf of the bank

170
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,400
be sure you remember that all right

171
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,320
other dealers wear red jackets I'll say

172
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,720
Rick is lucky Chinese can earn yeah well

173
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,670

an ER operation we need to be noticed

175
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920

how many 200 buy them now field you paid

188
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,100
584 200 pairs way to go Nick

189
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,370
I sold at 590 [ __ ] doubt just buy

190
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,220
2,000 quid

191

[Music]

192
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,920
they were a good bunch and never came to

193
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,889
learn it looked like a madhouse Aurora

194
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,779
traders waving and shouting are rookies

195
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,790
at the racetrack they're all made sense

196
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,790
when there were so many cups of course

197
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,649
but that's normal in any operation

198
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,300
especially I knew one of ours the

199
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,680
important thing was we were picking up

200
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,510
the business in the future Monroe's

201
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:11,359
[Music]

202
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,750
initial margins like a down payment on

203
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,699
each futures contract that we trade they

204
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,199
don't have to pay that in full until the

205
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,360
contract matures but in the meantime the

206
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,190
value of each contract might go up or

207
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,980
down so SIMEX calculate our positions on

208
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,690
a daily basis and they'll ask us for

209
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,190
more money if the market moves against

210
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,160
us and that's variation margin got it I

211
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,279
think with a type of an hour's account

212
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,990
I've had a few mistakes nothing serious

213
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,660
but I need some way to put them to luck

214
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,470
and work them out

215
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,120
sure well what's your lucky number

216
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,019
hey it is a very lucky Chinese number

217
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,480
and how many numbers do we need five and

218
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,829
let's give it all the luck I can handle

219
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:07,449
call it the eight eight eight eight

220
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:10,260

222
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,500
and now it gives me great pleasure to

223
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:47,330
welcome the challenge we may be the

224
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,700
oldest merchant bank in the world but

225
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,950
that's no excuse for not keeping up with

226
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,770
the times when I became chairman I

227
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,140
realized we couldn't go on running

228
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,410
bearings like a gentlemen's club we had

229
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,720
to look beyond our traditional

230
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,160
recruiting grounds the old school tie to

231
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,150
seek out a new and hungrier breed we're

232
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,040
beginning to see the fruits of those

233
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,620
efforts and I have to say the recovery

234
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,760
and profitability

235
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,180
since the reorganization has been

236
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,990
amazing to be frank I've discovered it's

237
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,029
not actually terribly difficult to make

238
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,529
money in the securities business

thing Monday and taking the loss instead

274
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,100
I waited for the market to change it

275
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,270
changed all right but not the way I

276
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,400
wanted now I was stuck with a bigger

277
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,290
loss than I could own up to and it was

278
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,040
all my fault

279
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,800

280
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,810

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,280
loyalty did you make the client good of

283
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,790

pounds Shh it was only 20 before the

288
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,180

00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,420
coming else what is Simon joins say do

290
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,660
you see these peaches down a few because

291
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,160
then we'll be where I saw you balance

292
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,240
the books by the end of the month

293
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,760
yeah well we trade on her own account

294
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,770
until we wipe out their losses and then

295
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,990
we can use money from the client account

296
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,460
and pay about where next month's bothers

297
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,830
you mean yeah that's all the market is

298
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,560
one giant casino

299
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,960
I was captain but nobody looked at the

300
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,879
books until the end of each month as

301
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,409
long as the five eighths account showed

302
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:24,789
a nil balance in the last day of the

303
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,950
month no one would suspect anything is

304
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,590
wrong but instead of winning back the

305
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,019
position we made more losses I had to

306
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:33,309
borrow more money from the client

307
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:35,270
account to keep them hidden

308

the worst part

330
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:07,640
Lisa thinking I was this brilliant

331
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,549
success if she only knew what I [ __ ] up

332
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:13,669
I really was when I wanted the market to

333
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,799
go up as went down if I wanted it to go

334
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,919
down it went up it was hard not to take

335
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:21,580
it personally

336
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,090
Nick just worked out the balance in its

337
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,100
account the losses are over ten million

338
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,380
dollar they keep it [ __ ] Boston huh

339
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,560
there's no need to panic there's not

340
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,940
enough in the client account to make

341
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,050
margin famous Nick

344
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,350
unless unless my sellers that will

345
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,770
generate commissioning and return the

346
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,480
velocity on the phi beta kappa cee-lo

347
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,320
as long as I could get London to keep

348
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,119
sending out money to finance the client

349
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,519
positions I'd have enough cash to stay

350
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,759
on top of the margin payments it was

351
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,789
like robbing Peter to pay Paul

352
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,350
but hopefully I'd end up making enough

353
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,970
money to pay Peter back before he found

354
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,200
out meanwhile I had to generate more and

355
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,940
more business to justify him on cash

356
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,200
calls and for that I needed customers

357
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:10,499

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,450

366
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:31,619
business on SIMEX with the exception of

367
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,570
George Soros I probably trade in the

368
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,419
Nikkei more than anyone sometimes over

369
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,149

reach London at the highest level it's

595
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,750
slightly embarrassing but one of our

596
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:24,370
traders he expose his bottom what silly

597
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,800

00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,990
maybe we should sack you sacking him

600
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,800
would be awkward to say the least he

601
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,390
generates a significant amount of our

602
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,600
profits in the Southeast Asia division I

603
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,100
I ought to mention we're getting rather

604
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,690
a lot of stick from the Bank of England

605
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,360
about our funding of technically we're

606
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,890
in breach of regulations governing the

00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,090
to Andy Dixon at the bank he said the

610
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,970
matter was there in reasonably deep in

611
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:06,000

612
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,250

the exhibitionist tendencies well I

615
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,150
suppose there's probably something we

616
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,050
should leave to the Singapore

617
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,500
authorities I have to say I'm inclined

618
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:30,340

00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,190
deal with Peter Norris he's such a

730
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,600
red-hot traitor I've arranged for him to

736
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,690
you should see the way he takes that

737
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,609
market on are you enjoying yourself Nick

738
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:53,690
yes it's alright alright

739
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,240
[Laughter]

740
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,800
now we need to talk about merging the

741
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,320
sales areas in Asia Nick has some views

742
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,960
if we can replicate his success in Hong

743
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,490
Kong and Tokyo what do you think it does

744
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,310
make a lot of sense to merge then we

745
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,800
need to be controls of course but the

746
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,870
trading books can be used in such a way

747
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,090
as to supplement the customers

748
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,310
requirements and increase information

749
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:26,920
flows synergetic Lee exactly synergy

750
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,500
so you see Peter Nick agrees and he's

751
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,090
been very successful with his customers

752
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:35,500
they love it yes excellent well keep up

753
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,060

754
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,340

00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,180

to survive the end-of-year Audion there

806
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,500
was that little matter of the 7.78 billy

807
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,240
in the end which I'd fabricated to plug

808
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,210
the owl in the five eighths account I

809
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,230
should have told me so when I had the

810
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,270
chance but there was this voice that

811
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:51,010
kept telling me I tried it out and my

812
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,900
losses before I could try it out of them

813
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,780

where's from Cybex yes I know it's from

815
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,230
SIMEX it came on you away it appears

816
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,820
that your company has financed the

817
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,650
trading positions held by sub-account

818
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,110
eight eight eight eight eight if this is

819
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:12,850
the case you have violated SIMEX rule

820
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:14,830
eight to two which prohibits members

821
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,480
from financing the trading margins of

822
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,310
their customers they're just banging on

823
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,530

825
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,330
customer account I mean we have umpteen

826
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:27,280
trading account so I'd have to look into

827
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,460
it with a number one trader in town and

828
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,720

him only charge when it finally came to

920
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,660

00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,109
sentence

922
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,620
the charge has been reduced to a

923
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,140
misdemeanor the maximum penalty is a

924
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,570
$200 fine I think we should plead guilty

925
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,460
it was uncanny I'd got away with it

926
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:23,430
again shining example I'm compiling the

927
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,050
end of your audit and there seems to be

928
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,540
a big hole in the accounts I'm missing

929
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,940
this seven point seven eight billion yen

930
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,380

Thanks technically we're in breach of

01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:08,240
SIMEX regulations but basically it was

1011
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,430
just a non transaction with any luck the

1012
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,570
auditors won't mention it in the

1013
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,070
official report or we could have

1014
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,590
problems with the local regulator sounds

1015
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:19,520

1016
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,740
million dollars doing arbitrage in a

01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:25,010

1018
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,470
a year the guy's a turbo arbitrage yeah

1019
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:29,210
well frankly if he's doing that amount

1020
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:30,830
of business for that amount of profit I

1021
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:32,990

1022
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:47,830

01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:14,180
million dollars it's obvious Tony it's

1032
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:15,320

01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:10,159
eighths account

1172
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:28,060

1175
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,370
announcement to make

1176
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:43,660
I know that some of you are worried

1177
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:45,720
about our exposure in the market and

1178
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,680
you're probably wondering about the

1179
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:52,320
identity of our mystery customer X well

1180
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:57,610
the fact is he doesn't exist we are

1181
01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:00,580
their customer parents and if you look

1182
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,900
properly at the five eighths account

1183
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,970
which is not a client account at all

1184
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,890
it's an errors account you'll realize

1185
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,870
that it's concealing losses in the

1186
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,110
region of two hundred million pounds now

1187
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,970

1188
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:16,080
