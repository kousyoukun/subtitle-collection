...which he blames on the actions of a rogue trader in Singapore.
是由新加坡的一名股票经纪造成

估计今次损失达八亿至十亿英镑

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,570

Look at that!

Will you fuckin' look at that!

- What, with the black guy? - Yeah.

It's a shame. She looks well spoken for.

Never know your luck, though. Eh, mate?

13
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,900
- Think I'll give her the treatment! - No, Steve, no. Don't do that.
我会好好待她                                    不，史提

嗨，靓女，我有东西给你看

Are you out of your mind or what? You fuckin' little prick!

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,940
And I mean little!
别在众人面前出丑

Don't judge a book by its cover, sweetheart.

- You're out of your league, arsehole. - Calm down.
你太幸运       什么？只是对女士说

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,140
Fuck off or you're dead!
滚开，你死定

21

立刻出去...                                     他有悔意了

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,220
He's pissed. He meant no disrespect. That's the last thing on anybody's mind.
他喝醉，不想惹事的              也不能责骂

23
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,820
Tell him if he doesn't put that thing away,...
叫他把那东西收起，否则

24
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,780
...I'll rip it off and shove it down his fuckin' throat!
怎样？      我会扭着他脖子

26
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,450
Just leave it. It's not worth it!
别管他             他不值

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,740
He's done it again. I had to pull him off!
再来我便送他到监狱

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,580

You all right? Nick!

让我们为霸菱工作

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,580
（霸菱银行）

You've probably heard about me.

Barings was the oldest private bank in the world.

They financed the Louisiana Purchase back in eighteen hundred and something.
在1803年   支持美国购入路易斯安纳州

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,290
They even had the Queen as a customer!
历史真长久  女皇都是顾客

39
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,850
I was just a humble clerk.
我只是文员

40
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,850
But not for long, I hoped.
希望快晋升

41
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,490
Car crash.

Poor chap!
真可怜

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,010
Nick, I know you're keen to get out of the back office and onto the trading floor,...
尼克   知道你希望在股市交易所工作

46
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,090
...but in the meantime something else has come up.

We've got problems in our Jakarta office.

We need someone to go out there and sort things out.

49
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,840
I thought that someone might be...

...Nick Leeson?

"Emerging markets" they were calling them,...
人人都厚望霸菱对新市场

54
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,850
...and Barings was one of the first to see their potential.
很有兴趣

55
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,480
The rewards were high. But so were the risks.

...come to some arrangement with laughing boy...

61
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,130
Customers refuse to pay for them.

62
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,200
They say what's on them doesn't match the original deal.
说协议价钱  与原本有别

63
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,730
The real reason: the market goes down, they don't want any more.

64
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,640
It's a mess.
很难搞

65
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,440
You're absolutely 100 per cent right, Susi. It's one hell of a fuckin' mess.
苏慈，你说得对  真难搞

66
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,560
周日早上十时 飞机到二十哩

It was my job to sort out the certificates...

...so customers wouldn't have any more excuses not to pay.

69
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,850
Until then, Barings had this bloody great hole in their balance sheet.
令霸菱免受损失

70
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,960
It was boring work, but I knew if I made a success of it...
这工作很闷，但若成功...

71
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,000
...then I could write my own ticket.

72
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,960
All the certificates are in the right denomination.

I'm, um... Nick Leeson. Can I help you?
我是尼克利森   有何贵干

78
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,760
Barings sent me to help with the settlements.
霸菱派来协助你

79
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,400
Didn't they tell you?
没告诉你？

80
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,880
Oh, of course! I've been on at them for so long I never thought they'd get round to it.
当然有           是很久的事，以为他们忘了

81
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,270
What do we do with that lot? Build a bonfire?
那么干什么？开营火会？

82
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,670
I'd never even heard of Barings before I started working for 'em.
在霸菱工作前我没听过它的名

83
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,070
It's not like there's a Barings in Watford.
和华福的霸菱不同

84
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,760
You're a hero in London. They think the sun shines out of your arse.
你在伦敦成为英雄  他们认为你干得很好

85
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,910
Really? I was beginning to feel like one of those Japanese soldiers.
真的？ 感到自己像日本武士

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Still stuck out in the jungle 20 years after the war!
二十年后从森林到现实

87
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,480
What's it like here? They tell me it's not safe at night.
这里是怎样？晚间外出很危险

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,510
Bollocks. The locals are great.
夸大，这城市很有活力

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,670
And it's not full of pompous ex-colonials thinking they were born to rule the world.
好处是不会有自大的英国人  以为这里由他们管治

90
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,590
That's what I love about Asia.
所以我爱亚洲

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,710
Anyone can make it. Doesn't matter which school you went to.
无论是否出自名校都有机会

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,390
When they told me I was going to Jakarta I had to look it up on the map.
当派到雅加达时   我要在地图找它呢！

93
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,670
As a matter of fact, so did I.

I really want to be a trader.
我想当股票经纪

95
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,830
If Barings don't let me on the floor after this, I'm off.
若霸菱不让我当经纪便离开

96
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,750
- Not gonna be bloody clerking all my life. - Ooh! Ambitious, aren't we?
不想一生当文员                       我们有野心，对吗？

97
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,750
- Is that bad? - It's great.
不好吗？          真好

98
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,670
I just want to get on in life.
我想干一番事业

Well, night, Nick. That was fun.
尼克，晚安          很愉快

102

Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
对

103
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,470
- OK. Night-night! - See you tomorrow, then.
好了，晚安               明天见

104
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,470
Lisa was a stunner all right.

Love at first sight.

106
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,900
Together we made short work of the rest of those bonds.
我们一起很有感觉

107
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,270
Soon we cleared up most of Barings' losses and it was time to go home.
我们做完霸菱的呆坏帐准备回家

108

As a reward for Jakarta I'd been given the far more important market of Singapore,...
由于在雅加达很成功         所以派我到新加坡       更重要市场

...with a brief to set up my own trading operation.

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,090
- If you need anything, call me. - Right, thanks.
若有需要，可找我          谢谢你

131
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,140
- Have a nice day. - Thanks. Bye.
祝你愉快         谢谢，再见

132
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,210
Goodbye.
再见

133
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,060
Not bad for a chancer from Watford, eh?
算不错吧

134
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,490
Well, um... I think we should test out that mattress, big boy.
先试试睡床是否舒服

135
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,570
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah!
要吗？    要

136
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,410
I can't see any problem in you handling both sides of the operation.
目前你在处理业务上并无犯错

137
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,060
- At least until volumes increase. - Right.
并数额大增             对

138
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,930
You shouldn't need more than two on the trading floor.
你不需超过两个助手

139
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,930
A couple more in the back office.
而要多个文职处理转帐

140
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,850
No need to pay top dollar.
无须高薪

141
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,690
Get them young, get them hungry and train them up.
只要年轻肯学习

142
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,330
- I'm a bottom line kind of guy, Nick. - Absolutely. That's my philosophy.
尼克，简单好了                                  当然，这也是经营哲学

143
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,850
I took him at his word. My team were young, hungry...
如他说，我的队员很年轻

144
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,650
...and they didn't have a clue.
他们好学，但对股市没经验

145
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,520
A futures contract allows you to buy or sell a specified amount of a commodity...
期指合约是一份    买卖合约

146
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,000
...at a specified price at a future date.
在指定日期的指定价格

147
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,320
Right. Um...
对

148
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,930
It's like, if I agree to sell you this cup of cappuccino, which I don't yet own,...
若我同意把咖啡卖给你

149
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,050
...at 45 cents a month from now...
我在一个月后以四十五仙卖给你

150
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,330
If I can buy the cappuccino at, say, 43 cents, I make a profit.
到时我花四十三仙买到，便赚钱

151
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,720
If the price goes the other way I have to pay more, and I lose.
若价钱上升要多花钱，便是亏损

152
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,690
It's timing - buying and selling at the right moment.
关键就是买卖的时间

153
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,000
Sometimes espresso might be the best deal, or salt, or pepper.
有时咖啡最赚钱是盐或胡椒

154
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,160
So, we're running a supermarket?
就像经营超级市场

155
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,720
We're not buying and selling anything real.
其实没有进行真正买卖

156
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,320
It's just numbers - contracts based on the value of the Nikkei,...
只是数字游戏           游戏是依照日经股票市场

157
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,130
...the Tokyo stock market.
游戏是依照日经股票市场

158
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,560
- Er, we do this for the bank? - No, no, for the customers.
这是为银行做？                 --不，是为顾客

159
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,610
We are not allowed to trade on behalf of the bank.
我们不准代表银行炒卖

160
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,120
Be sure you remember that, all right?
要紧记这点

161
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,850
Other dealers wear red jackets. All same. Red is lucky Chinese colour.
交易员全都穿着红褛    红色是中国人的幸运颜色

162
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,810
Well, we want to stand out. We're a new operation. We need to be noticed.
对，所以我们要特别点    新的运作要被人注目

163
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,840
May be bad luck. Different colour.
不同的颜色会带来不幸

164
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,840
Bollocks. We make our own luck.
别傻，我们有彩数

165
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,200
Nick's right. We're cool dudes, man. Whoo!
尼克说得对，我们很帅

166
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,680
Fernando. Anything happening in Tokyo?
法兰度，东京有什么发生吗？

167
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,510
Nothin'. How's SIMEX?
没什么，新加坡市场呢？

168
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,670
Same here. No one's playin'.
一样，成交量只有五百九十

169
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,750
590, and trading small.
一样，成交量只有五百九十

170
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,640
600, and thin too.
不足六百

171
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,080
580 here. There's a seller who wants to trade in size. Shall I low-tick him?
五百八十，有买家想大手入市    要给低价吗？

172
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,750
Yeah. Flush him out.
好，让他买入呢

173
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,200
- Squeeze the sucker. - How many?
把坏人赶走              --多少？

174
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,600
200.
二百

175
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,350
Buy them... now.
现在买入

176
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,790
- Buy 'em! - Filled!
买入            --补仓

177
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,720
We paid 580 for 200.
你以五百八十元买入二百手

178
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,190
Way to go, Nick! I sold at 590.
尼克，我刚以五百九十沽货

179
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,390
Fuck a duck! Just made 2,000 quid.
该死，刚赚到二千英镑

180
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,120
Yes!
对

181
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,830
They were a good bunch and they were keen to learn.
他们很好学  股票经纪各施各法

182
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,190
It looked like a madhouse with all the traders waving and shouting,...
就像马场一样刺激

183
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,150
...but it all made sense once you got the hang of it.
置身其中更难忘    我干了什么？

184
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,310
There were hiccups, but that's normal in any operation,...
市场有起有跌     这是很正常

185
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,070
...especially a new one like ours.
对新人而言

186
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,910
The important thing was we were picking up the business...
最重要令生意上升

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,990
...and the future looked rosy.
未来充满憧憬

188
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,110
Nick, what's the difference between initial margin and variation margin?
尼克   单一I展和综合I展有何分别

189
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,150
Initial margin's a down payment on each futures contract that we trade.
单一I展是只付期指合约首期

190
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,510
We don't pay in full until a contract matures.
在合约期满前也不需付全数

191
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,270
But in the meantime the value of each contract may go up or down.
但每份合约都会各别升跌

192
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,500
So SIMEX calculate our positions on a daily basis.
新加坡交易所每日计我们的交易

193
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,820
They'll ask for more money if the market goes against us. That's variation margin.
当市场与投资有分差便要补仓   这叫综合I展

194
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,300
Got it. I think!
我明白了

195
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,070
We need to open an errors account. We've had a few mistakes.
我们要开一个记错户口  我们有点错，虽没什么，但...

196
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,270
I need somewhere to put them till I can write them out.
我把帐目转到那里直至填补错误

197
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,940
Sure. What number shall I give it?
好的，我们要什么户口号码？

198
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,860
- Well, what's your lucky number? - Eight. It is a very lucky Chinese number.
你的幸运号码？               --八号，中国人喜欢八号

199
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,380
And how many numbers do we need?
要多少个号码

200
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,620
Five.
五个

201
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,830
Then let's give it all the luck it can handle. Call it the 88888 account.
就起个幸运号码  叫88888户口吧

202
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:32,420
And now it gives me great pleasure to welcome the chairman of Barings Bank,...
我很荣幸为你介绍   霸菱主席

203
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,740
...Peter Baring.
彼得霸菱

204
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,900
We may be the oldest merchant bank in the world,...
我们是全球最悠久的银行之一

205
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,940
...but that's no excuse for not keeping up with the times.
但并不代表我们过时

206
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,980
When I became chairman,...
当我上任主席一职后

207
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,450
...I realised we couldn't go on running Barings like a gentlemen's club.
我发现不可把它当成俱乐部

208
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,820
We had to look beyond our traditional recruiting grounds,...
我们要打破  传统管治方法...

209
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,970
...the old school tie,...
传统学校领带

210
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,130
...to seek out a new and hungrier breed.
寻求新的管理方式

211
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,540
We're beginning to see the fruits of those efforts, and I have to say,...
我们开始看到成效      利润...

212
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,410
...the recovery in profitability, since the reorganisation, has been... amazing.
更大幅回升

213
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,130
To be frank, I've discovered it's not actually terribly difficult...
坦白说... 在证券业务中赚取利润并不困难

214
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,940
...to make money in the securities business!
在证券业务中赚取利润并不困难

215
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,330
Filled.
补仓

216
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,370
Yeah, you paid 50 for 20.
对，以五十元买二十手

217
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,370
Come in.
进来

218
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,290
Simon, er... I've got a slight problem.
辛逊，我出了一点问题

219
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,810
One of the girls sold 20 contracts for Fuji Bank instead of buying.
有一女职员为富士银行  买入二十手，却误沽货了

220
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,050
I can't do anything about it till Monday.
我要周一才修补这问题

221
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,620
What's the damage?
损失多少

222
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,970
20,000 at the close.
收市时达二万

223
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,650
Sack the cow. She'll never work on SIMEX again.
开除她   她不可再工作

224
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,210
That's a bit hard, isn't it?
太不近人情吧！

225
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,330
Look, you handle it.
自己处理吧

226
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,570
Have a word with London, but make sure you make that client good.
向伦敦汇报，要令客户满意

227
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,440
All right.
好吧

228
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,170
Hey! Have a beer, shithead!
喝杯酒吧

229
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,690
Cheers.
干杯

230
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,680
Hi, darling.
嗨，老公

231
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,970
Anyone seen Kim?
看到金吗

232
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,330
She was here a minute ago.
她之前还在...

233
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,640
Kim...
金

234
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,530
Nick, Nick...
尼克

235
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,600
I'm really sorry. I got so confused.
尼克，对不起

236
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,680
- Everybody was shouting all at once. - That's the job.
当各人都在大喊，太混乱了

237
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,730
That's what it's all about, keeping a cool head.
这份工作就是要保持冷静

238
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm so sorry! I'll pay you back the money.
对不起，我会赔钱给你

239
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,920
Sure, Kim. Four years' salary? And if the market moves it could be even worse.
金，那是你四年的薪酬    若市场再有变动情况更糟

240
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,450
Come on, come on.
来

241
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,490
Come on, everyone makes mistakes.
每个人都会犯错

242
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,810
Look, with a bit of luck I can trade out of it on Monday, all right?
若幸运，周一定会渡过难关

243
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,960
Nick, I've been waiting for you while everyone else is having a good time.
尼克，我一直在等你

244
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,040
- I'm going home now. - Kim!
我要回家了              --金

245
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,680
Kim...!
金

246
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,240
- Everything all right? - Never better.
顺利吗？               --很顺利

247
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,160
Why don't you let me come in and help? I can't sit around all day doing nothing.
让我到公司帮你，我不想游手好闲

248
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,240
It's not a problem, Lisa.
丽莎，不是这问题

249
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,840
I can handle it.
我处理得来

250
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,280
Fernando, how are March futures looking?
法兰度，三月的数目怎样？

251
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,400
- I need 20 contracts at Friday's price. - You won't get Friday's price!
我暂时没有周五价格

252
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,520
I should have closed off the position and taken the loss.
我应该周一开始便平仓

253
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,830
Instead, I waited for the market to change.
总比等市场变动好

254
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,360
It changed all right, but not the way I wanted.
它的确变动了，但不是如我所愿

255
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,590
Now I was stuck with a bigger loss than I could own up to. And it was all my fault.
我损失更多金钱   这是我的错

256
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,670
Nick! I hear your girl handed in her notice.
尼克，听闻你的下属金辞职了

257
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,230
Never came back. She couldn't stand the pace.
对，她受不了这些压力

258
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,960
So much for loyalty!
够仗义

259
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,000
- Did you make the client good? - Of course. Made a small profit, actually.
你的顾客怎么了          --还好，有一点点进帐

260
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,070
Good man.
那很好

261
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,950
This one's for the five eights account.
这是属于88888户口

262
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,080
I bought the missing contracts.
我找到了那些合约

263
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,510
60,000?
合共六万英镑吗

264
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,720
- Shh! - It was only 20 before.
之前只是二万英镑

265
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,710
And the market went the wrong way. I had to cut the loss.
当市场变坏时我便立刻沽货

266
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,760
What did Simon Jones say?
辛森钟斯说什么

267
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,800
Are you serious? He'd shut us down if he knew.
你认真的吗   若他知真相定会辞退我们

268
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,590
It'll be all right so long as we balance the books by the end of the month.
只要在月底能收支平衡便没问题

269
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,710
- How? - We trade on our own account...
怎可能    --我们用自己的户口进行买卖

270
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,870
...until we wipe out the losses, then we use money from the client account...
直至填补损失为止    我们用顾客的钱

271
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,350
...and pay it back with next month's profits.
利用下个月的利润填补给客户

272
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,000
You mean, gamble?
你要作赌注吗

273
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,910
Relax, Bonnie. That's all the market is.
放心，邦妮    股市就如赌场一样

274
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,190
One giant casino!
浩大之极

275
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,870
George!
佐治

276
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,830
I was counting on nobody looking at the books until the end of each month.
我希望无人会在月结前翻查帐目

277
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,910
As long as the five eights account had a nil balance on the last day of the month,...
只要88888户口在每月最后一天   显示出没有盈余

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,790
...no one would suspect that anything was wrong.
便不会惹人怀疑

279
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,110
But instead of winning back the position we made more losses,...
不但没有反转劣势反而越赌越输

280
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,070
...and I had to borrow more money from the client account to hide them.
我要从客户的户口   借钱来隐瞒真相

281
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,660
Fuckin' hell, George, what are you playing at? Get fuckin' out!
佐治，你在玩什么？滚

282
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,740
Get fuckin' out! Now!
立刻给我滚

283
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,620
What the hell are you playing at? Out! Get out!
你在玩什么？滚        好了

284
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,660
Fuckin' hell!
该死的

285
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,260
- Agh. - God, you're tense. Stiff as a board.
你太紧张了

286
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,710
If you only knew! All cos those bastards won't let me hire proper staff.
你不明白    他们不让我聘用合适的员工

287
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,390
- I thought it was going so well. - It is. It's going brilliant.
我还以为一切顺利          --不错

288
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,910
I just spend most of my life covering everybody else's arse.
我只是忙于收拾别人的残局

289
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,900
Well, why don't you let me help with the back office?
不如让我到公司帮你吧

290
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,380
- I'm bored being a lady of leisure. - No.
我平时在家中呆着呢

291
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,700
Why not? It's ridiculous, you having to handle trading and settlements.
尼克，为何？ 文职事业不是由你负担

292
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,700
You'll have a nervous breakdown.
你快要精神崩溃了

293
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,180
I don't want you interfering. I can handle it.
因为我不想你介入我可以处理的

294
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,940
All right, keep your pants on! No one's saying you can't.
好吧，那么你别发怒  你一定做得到

295
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,940
I'm not going back to being a bloody clerk. I'd rather be a plasterer.
我不回去当文员   我宁愿当抹灰匠

296
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,780
My mum always used to say I could be anything I wanted,...
我妈妈常说  只要有恒心，铁柱磨成针

297
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,620
...so long as I took my chances - and worked like a dog.
只要肯努力

298
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,980
Well, you have. You've worked really hard and it paid off.
你已经很努力了，而且还得回报

299
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,860
She'd have been so proud of you.
她一定为你而自豪

300
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,180
Do you really think so?
真的吗

301
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,380
Yeah.
当然

302
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,260
I know I am!
对

303
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,940
That was the worst part - Lisa thinking I was this brilliant success.
最惨的是丽莎以为我是天才

304
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,980
If she only knew what a fuck-up I really was!
她并不知道我其实很不济

305
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,500
When I wanted the market to go up, it went down.
当我想股市上升时它便下跌

306
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,650
If I wanted it to go down, it went up.
我想它下跌它却又上升

307
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,500
It was hard not to take it personally.
这真难缠

308
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,420
Nick?
尼克？

309
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,860
Nick! I just worked out the balance in the eights account.
我刚计算了88888的收支平衡

310
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,700
- The losses are over $10 million! - Keep your fuckin' voice down!
我们损失了超过一千万元        --邦妮，别这么大声

311
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,770
Look, there's no need to panic.
也不用那么慌张

312
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,330
There's not enough in the client account to make margin payments, Nick.
客户的帐户不够钱填补I展欠款

313
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,130
Right.
没错

314
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,220
I need dollars. I need dollars to cover the initial margin payment!
我需要钱填补最初的I展欠款

315
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,570
I can get dollars from London to cover all the client positions for the futures I buy!
我叫伦敦汇钱给我填补这些损失

316
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,370
Nothing unusual about that. But I'm gonna need yen.
这样也不是罕见       但我需要日圆

317
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,500
Gonna need yen to cover the daily variation columns!
以便在月底前

318
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,770
Which'll leave a yen deficit by the end of the month.
填补所损失的日圆

319
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,130
Unless... unless I sell options.
除非... 我沽售期权来换取日圆佣金

320
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,930
That'll generate commission in yen.
我沽售期权来换取日圆佣金

321
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,620
And return the balance sheet on the five eights account to zero!
将88888户口维持零进帐

322
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,810
As long as London kept sending out money to finance the client positions,...
只要我能说服伦敦总公司汇钱

323
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,370
...I'd have enough cash to stay on top of the margin payments.
给我填补损失

324
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,570
It was like robbing Peter to pay Paul,...
这只是亡羊补牢

325
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,370
...but hopefully I'd end up making enough to pay Peter back before he found out.
但我希望赚到足够的金钱 给我填补损失

326
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,080
Meanwhile I had to generate more and more business to justify my cash calls,...
其间  我要找更多生意来证明

327
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,320
...and for that I needed customers.
我是为顾客利益要求现金资助

328
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,600
The bigger the better.
越多越好

329
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,160
Mm-hm. Oui.
好

330
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,850
Mr Leeson.
利森先生...

331
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,370
- I'm Pierre Beaumarchais. - Nice to meet you.
我是彼亚波马斯          --很高兴认识你

332
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,680
I work for the Geneva Banking Trust, based in the Bahamas.
我以巴哈马为基地的日内瓦银行工作

333
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,760
I was speaking with Ang Swee Tian, president of SIMEX.
我刚兴新加坡交易市所总裁  安维田谈话

334
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,370
He's impressed by the amount of business you've been generating.
因你为他赚取的生意额感满意

335
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,040
- There's a lot of opportunities here. - Oh, yes.
外边有很多机会           --就是

336
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,080
I do a lot of business on SIMEX.
我在新加坡市场也参与很多交易

337
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,840
With the exception of George Soros,...
除了佐治罗索斯

338
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,840
...I probably trade in the Nikkei more than anyone.
我在日经市场的投资比任何人多

339
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,000
Sometimes over 5,000 contracts in a day.
一日通常高达五千张合约

340
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,520
That is a lot. The whole market only does about 20.
整个市场的成交量只有二十左右

341
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,880
Could Barings handle that amount of business?
霸菱可以处理这么大的生意吗

342
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,280
You bet we could!
当然可以

343
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,930
Beaumarchais was the answer to my prayers.
波马斯是我的救星

344
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,570
I'd be able to siphon off enough commission...
我利用当中所得的佣金

345
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,960
...to square the eights account once and for all.
一次过填补88888户口的损失

346
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,360
- Hello? - Pierre Beaumarchais.

我想买四千张六月份的合约

348
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,200
I've... got a price of 350, but this'll move it.
目前的价格是三百五十  但股价不断变动

349
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,800
Try not to pay more than 400.
升幅别超过四百元

350
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,720
We gotta get them cheap. Beaumarchais is a big player.
我们低水入货  波马斯是大玩家

351
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,400
If we pull this off, we get a shitload of business.
若我们讨得他欢心便不愁没生意

352
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,040
- What's liquidity like? - Tight as a flea's arse.
流动资产如何          --只有很少

353
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,800
We'll get away with 500, then the price will move up.
我们在五百点沽货 之后股市上升

354
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,160
OK. But then we'll make the other traders think we're sellers.
要令其他交易家以为我们要沽货

355
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,550
And when the price drops... buy! All right?
到股价下跌时再买入

356
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240

我终于行运了  我突然停不了赚大钱

对准日经平均指数的走势    在炒股生意上取得优势  上落尽在我掌握之中

Up and up and up.
股市继续上升

Serves you right, Lisa!
加班

383
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:35,180
If it went all the way up to 19,000, I stood to make a killing on the options I'd sold.
若指数继续上升至一万九千点  我沽售所有期权后一定赚大钱

384
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,030
Come on, come on! Come on, baby, you can do it. Come on.
来吧...快

385
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,660

好

386
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,060
Bonnie, we're on a fuckin' roll!
邦妮，我们成功了

387
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,140
Yes!
是的

388
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,020
Do you think we'll do it?
我还以为功亏一篑

389
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,140
It's amazing! You've made back all the losses.
神奇，你填补了超过...

390
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,460
- Over $10 million. - What did I tell you? Oh, ye of little faith!
一千万元的损失           --我说过要有信心

391
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,260
You keep doubling up, and sooner or later...
你继续加倍入货很快我们便赚钱

392
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,380
...you're bound to win.
你继续加倍入货很快我们便赚钱

393
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,380
The Nikkei has closed up for the third day in a row,...
日经平均指数连续第三日停市

394
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,900

日经平均指数连续第三日停市

395
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,450
Analysts are predicting additional gains in the days ahead.
但没迹象显示会炒风过热...

396
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,620
- Happy? - Yeah. Are you?
开心吗             你呢？

397
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,530
Never better.
从未如此开心过

398
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,380
I have been sailing a bit close to the wind. I didn't want to worry you with it.
最初时损失了一点   但我不想令你担心

399
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,170
- What do you mean? - No, it's all right.
你说什么    没什么

400
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,780
The market turned round and a whole load of my positions came good.
市场改变，让我填补了损失

401
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,740
I made it all back.

402
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,810
What are you on about, Nick?
你怎么了

403
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,380
Don't get your knickers in a twist, but we made mistakes and ran up some losses.
别担心，我只是犯了一点错

404
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,850
I went out on a limb to get back the position.
所以我要赌一赌把钱赚回来

405
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,770
How big were the losses?
你损失多少

406
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,370
- It's about a million. - A million quid?!
大约一百万                      一百万英镑？

407
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,130
For God's sake, Nick!
尼克，你太过分

408
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,490
No, it's all right. It paid off. I squared it up.
没事了，已经赚回来

409
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,010
I had to do it to protect the guys.
我要保护我的下属

410
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,770
Promise me that you'll never do that again.

411
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,420
- It's not worth it, Nick. - I promise.
你不值得这样做    我答应你

412
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,210
You will give me a heart attack.
你快把我吓得心脏病发

413
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,770
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.
圣诞快乐

414
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,570
Fuck off!
该死

415
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,330
I really meant it. I was the number one trader, and as the new year came in...
我认真的   我是城中最成功交易员

416
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,770
...I was determined to kick my addiction to the eights account.
踏入新年，我决要    好好利用88888户口

417
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,730
What will the market do? Long-term?
你认为应长线    投资吗？

418
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,490
No one thinks long-term, they think nanoseconds!
你说笑吧，没人会考虑长线投资

419
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,250
- Long-term's tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow, then.
长线就是明天    就依你所说的

420
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,090
- That would be telling. - Leeson speaks, the market moves!
一言为定    利森的举动足以令市场变动

421
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,160
You said it, mate.
一言为定

422
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,410
Pierre.
彼亚

423
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,800
I want to sell the 220 call options and buy the 200 calls in December.
我要沽二百二十手看涨期权  在十二月买入二百手涨期权

424
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,930
I've got an offer of .138 for size.
你会有一点三八巴仙的佣金

425
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,890
Can you do better?
你做得到吗

426
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,610
I'll get back to you.
我再联络你

427
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,290
Quick as you can, Nick. I have to move fast.
尼克，我们要速战速决

428
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,970
What the hell is he on about, .138 for size?
什么？谁人会出这个价钱

429
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,330
The market in 220 calls is down. He wants to cut his losses.
沽二百二十手会亏蚀的   我们要为客人止蚀

430
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,080
- Yeah, but why .138? - It's a ratio.
为何出这价钱？         他们以百分率计算

431
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,440
The 200 calls are trading at 1,400.
以二百手换一千四百手

432
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,410
Divide 200 by 1,400, you get .143.
你便可以获得  一点四三巴仙的佣金

433
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,880
All right. But not .138.
但不是一点三八巴仙的佣金

434
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,320
Unless someone's offered him a discount. Probably Societe Generale.
除非有人给他折扣  彼亚是我们主要的客户

435
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,160
We can't let those wankers get our biggest client.
不能损失这个客人

436
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,720
- What are you gonna do? - Just have to leg it.
你打算怎样             我们一定要帮他

437
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,360
Buy the contracts from Pierre and sell them when the market rises?
你是说向彼亚买入那期股票             然后趁高沽货

438
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,440
I thought we were not supposed to trade for the bank.
我们不应为银行作买卖

439
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,480
Pierre? I can do it. What's the exact size?
彼亚，我可帮你，有多少期货

440
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,290
6,500? All right, leave it with me. No problem.
六千五百？等我来处理

441
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,120
What if the market doesn't rise, uh? What if it falls?
若股市下跌不上升那怎办

442
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,600
I've gambled and won before. I can gamble and win again.
我曾赌博胜了，一定可以再赢

443
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,310
Balls of steel, me old mateys, and you'd better believe it.
我是神奇小子，你要信我

444

邦妮        你再为我开启88888户口

445
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,160
We got caned on Beaumarchais' contracts.
我们被那些波马斯的股票害死

446
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,520
Now the bastard's gone back to Societe Generale.
那些混旦找中央股票行帮他们

447
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,880
Fax Brenda Granger in London. Ask her for funds to cover the margin payments.
你传真给佩达   叫她多点资金以应付I展款项

448
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,950
Tell her it's for client positions.
说是为了她的客户

449
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,920

Right away.
有事找你

452
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,910
Christ, I'd been rumbled! The only surprise was it'd taken so long.
一定是出事   终于被揭发

453
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,070
What was I gonna tell Lisa? She'd bloody murder me.

Check up on me?
查核我的帐目？

They're sending Ash Lewis out for the audit.

463
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,990
Ash Lewis?
艾斯路易斯？

464

男人见到她便怕

465
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,430
That's our booth.

我们为客人处理套利活动   所以交易量很大

You've just been given a ruddy great big bonus.
你刚收到丰厚的花红

Compared to Ash they're a couple of pussies.
他们没艾灰那样精明

该死的进来    这是什么

Got to think of something to do with my bonus.

给我啤酒         你认识我经纪佐治吗

I hear Barings have almost cornered the market here, thanks to you.

The rumours have been greatly exaggerated.

535
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,200
Watch the Drambuie settle.

And it's called depth charge.

Hey! Pretty women! What are you waiting for?

- Come on! - Tough shit, George.

Your charm's just not working tonight.

Flight lieutenants...!

你去帮她们决定来还是不来

- On three? - It worked before.

What'll it be, you old bastard?

Absolutely brilliant, Nick! Drinks are on me.

Oh, you've got to be jokin'!
你说笑吧

570
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,430
No laughing matter.
不是

571
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,820
Outraging a lady's modesty... very serious crime in Singapore.

572

News of my disgrace reached London. At the highest level.
我的罪行连伦敦总公司也知道

573

00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,740
He exposed his bottom.
他露体...

577
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,060
- Why? - Playing silly buggers, I expect.
为什么            我猜他们在输赌

578
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,700
Unfortunately, the law over there takes rather a dim view.
当地政府视这行为为严重重行

579
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,700
Maybe we should sack him.
应辞退他吗

580
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,860
Sacking him would be... awkward, to say the least.
这样做太惹人注目了

581
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:39,150
He generates a significant amount of our profits in Southeast Asia.
他为我们在东南亚分区赚大钱

582
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:43,270
I, er... ought to mention we're getting stick from the Bank of England...

...about our funding over there.
他为我们的英国银行赚大钱

584
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,660
Technically we're in breach of regulations on the ratio of lending to capital.
技术上违反政府条例        动用超出规定的资本比率

585
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,260
Would you like me to have a quiet word in their ear?
你想我和他们私下谈谈吗

586
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,300
Oh, we're not quite there yet.
还不是时候

587
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,060
When I spoke to Andy Dixon at the Bank, he said the matter was...
银行那方面的安迪说

588
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,220
..."buried reasonably deep in his in-tray".
他想把这件事低调处理

589
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,060
Just flagging a concern.
别让人想起这件事来

590
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,060
Quite right. It's something we should keep an eye on.
但要继续留意事态发展

591
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,180
Well... is that it? Any other business?
还有其他事吗

592
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,820
Well, what about this chap Leeson? He of the exhibitionist tendencies.
这个利森怎么办？他是露体狂

593
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,620
I suppose it's something we should leave to the Singapore authorities.
这些事应由当地政府处理

594
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,010
I have to say... I'm inclined to agree.
我同意

595
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,220
So, it was the profits that saved me.
事实上那些利润救了我一命

596
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,210
If they only knew!

Who is this mystery client, Nick? He must have rather large balls.
尼克，那神秘客户是谁？ 他一定有钱    对不起

608
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,210
I'm sorry, mate. Client confidentiality and all that.

Is it Pierre Beaumarchais?

Sorry, Loy, I... gotta go. I'll speak to you later.

Who do they think I am, George Soros?

到年终了，我越加泥足深陷

It didn't bear thinking about.

Nick! It's for you.

Ron! Can't believe you tracked me down already.
朗，你这么快已经找到我

Listen, with this conference you'll be away from the trading floor a long time.
近日发生的一切         令你没在市场出现

但我为你争取花红      你要努力为公司赚钱

我一定要出席葬礼                 我明白

653
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,470
I'll issue you a pass so you can come in on Sunday and trade through the night.
我会发给你一张通行证            让你周日晚进行交易

Well... no!

00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,670
That's completely out of order. Let someone else make the profits!

660
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,990
She's right, Nick. You're not a machine.
她说得对，你不是机器

661
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,630
It's bonus time. If I don't deliver, then everybody loses out.
很快会分花红不努力便前功尽废

662
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,150
It's not fair, Nick. You carry on at this rate, you're gonna be in a right old state.
这样不公平         再这样拼命工作很快会变化石

It's gonna be your funeral next.

...dust to dust.
尘归尘土归土

So how's it going over there?
你在那边情况怎样    还可以

You a plasterer's son!

I just wish your mum could have been here to see it.

681
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,100
Don't pay any attention to me.
别在意我的话

682
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,790
I felt sick going into the office,...
我讨厌回公司

683
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,860
...seeing all the people I'd been avoiding for months.
看到多月来我逃避的人

684
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:44,980

我只和他通电         在他们面前要伪装一切

Brenda was my cash lifeline.

But first I had to deal with Peter Norris.

You're my man, aren't you?
你是我的男人，不是吗

778
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:37,830
It was crazy going back. I couldn't hope to survive the end-of-year audit.
我只渴望能平安渡过年终的年结

779
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,980
There was that little matter of the 7.78 billion yen...
我把七十七亿八千万日圆转到

What's this letter all about?

Well, it's from SIMEX.

They're just banging on about our intra-day funding limits.

I'd have to look into it.

我们是最出色经纪  所以会受到严密监察

I'm bleeding, Nick!

Why didn't you tell me?

Cos I was waiting till I was sure!
我想先验证...

806

Your wife is OK...

00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,850
That was the turning point.

The man is single-handedly generating a fifth of the group's worldwide profits!
第五位赚钱的机构

我知道... 但一天内动用三千万元支付I展

You don't seem to understand. The volumes are enormous!

尼克是新加坡市场最大的玩家

822
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,690
- Hello? - Nick.

823
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,730
It's Brenda.
喂    尼克，我是佩达

824
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,130
Listen, buddy. This is putting a terrible strain on our borrowing.
我们的财政拍档收紧我们的贷款

825
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,040
Tony Hawes is all over me about your cash calls.
东尼贺斯要查你的现金流量

826
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:05,570
I hear you. But London is the cash cow for the business here.
是，我正在听   但伦敦和这里不同

827
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,240
We just don't have access to any other funds.

If you keep hassling me I've a good mind to stop trading.
若你再骚扰我   我宁愿停止交易

Just get back to me with some meaningful figures, OK?

Fuck off.

Hello?

尼克，幸好找到你        我知佩达难为你

834
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:39,680
I don't think any of you understand how it works out here.
你们不懂这里的运作

835
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,440
You may be right, mate. Anyway, consider it sorted.

But you are gonna have to start reducing these positions.

While I've got you, about your bonus...
还有...有关你的花红

839
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:55,800
The budget's tight. Though you've been exceptional there's not much to go round.
现时财政紧缩，知你很出色  所以别期望太大

840
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,880
I thought we had a record year!
今年不是赚大钱吗

841
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:02,440
Yeah. That said, I've put in a special plea to Peter and he's agreed to go up to 350.
对  所以他愿意给三十五万元花红

842
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,240
350? That's ridiculous!
三十五万？真是荒谬

843
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm really pushing out the boat for you, mate.
我已经为你尽力争取

844
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,360
I'm busting my balls here. I made us the top house in SIMEX.

845
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,440

Yeah, I know that, Nick.
这点我知

847
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,910
Look, I'll see what I can do.
我尽力吧

848
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,760
I'll see if it can't start with a four, eh?
看我能够争取四十万

849
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,790
That was their opening offer.
看我能够争取四十万

850
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,960
He'd have thought something was wrong if I'd accepted it straight away.
若以为我会接受        便错了

851
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,320
Yeah, it's like winning the lottery.
对，像中六合彩嘛

852
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,390
They must think the world of you.
他们应答谢你呢

853
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,200
What's the matter, Lisa?
丽莎，怎么了

854
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,000
What do you think's the bloody matter, Nick?
尼克，你以为什么

855
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,070
Everything's changed!
一切都改变了

856

I just wanna go home. Get the hell out of here and go home.
我想回家，想离开这里

857
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,390
But... you wanted to come back. What about the bonus?
你想回来，还说为花红

Well, can't you get the bonus in London?

Please, Nick! I wanna get on with my life.
尼克，我想重头开始

860

I wanna start a family. I'm going stir-crazy here all on my own!
建立家庭  离开这令人疯癫的地方

861
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,630
Calm down. Look, I just need a bit more time to sort things out, turn things around.
好吧，冷静点，慢慢来...

862
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,310
No! You're up at dawn and then you come back at night and collapse into bed...
你早出晚归，回来时倦极了

863
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,710
How am I meant to get pregnant again if we never make love?
我们不干怎再次怀孕

864
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,710
I know. But this could set us up for life!
我知，会影响我们生活

865
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,510
- When's bonus day? - 24th of February. Just five weeks to go.
何时取得花红？          二月二十四，还有五周

Right, we're gonna leave on the 25th.
好吧，我们二十五号离开

All right.

870
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,550
With everything else closing in on me, I'd forgotten about the mooning charge.
无论任何事我要熬下去

871
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,020
When it finally came up, I was facing a possible jail sentence.
因为上到法庭我可能要坐牢

The charge has been reduced to a misdemeanour.
控罪减为行为不检

你说得对    喂？情况怎样

Speaking.
对

Is everything all right?

It's a little complicated. What do you need?

这是嘉诺和伦敦霸菱的交易

890
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,260
...and Barings London. It fell through the computer system.
所以没记在电脑 我和电脑的经理

891
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,460
I'll have a word with the systems manager.
商讨后再找你

892
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:58,500
I need three bits of paper.
我要三方面文件

893
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:02,100
One: confirmation from SLK that the 7.78 billion yen will be paid.
第一是嘉诺证明文件  显示支付那七十七亿八千万

894
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:05,340
Two: sight of your bank balance to show it's been received.
第二是你们的银行结算  显示接收了

895
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:10,580
And three: a note from Ron Baker saying he's aware of the deal and approves it.
第三是朗伯嘉的证明信  表示他知这交易

896
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,700
Well?
怎样？

897
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,580
Oh, it's just a computer glitch.
没什么，电脑出错

898
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:20,220
They're doing their annual audit.
他们进行结算

899
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:45,610
And so, with scissors and paste, I created $78 million out of thin air.
将会支付七十七亿八千万日圆  利用剪贴便创造了

900
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,280
This was forgery, pure and simple,...
伪造过程非常简单

901
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,400
...and there was no going back.

902
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,450
- Nick! - Simon.

903
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,680
Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!
辛逊，你把我吓倒

904
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:00,610
- What's this missing seven billion yen? - Oh, that's a nightmare.
为何会损失七十亿日圆                  那是个噩梦...

905
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,250
It's an OTC trade that was incorrectly booked.
上月的结算纪录错误

906
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,640
The auditors are really on my case about it.
核数师因这问题找我

907
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,690
It's a pain in the arse, but we've got to get it sorted.
我们要尽快纠正错误

908
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,050
The point is, we're owed the money by SLK.
问题是欠SLK款项

909
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:12,770
Who the hell are SLK?
谁是SLK？

910
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:15,730
Speer, Leads and Kellagg. It's a brokerage house.
是嘉诺股票行

911
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:19,170
Better send me a memo as soon as. Get these auditors off my back.
给我内部报告            要尽快解决

912
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,640
Sure, Simon. Don't worry, I'm onto it.
当然，放心，我会处理

913
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:31,920
Bonnie, it's Nick. Listen. Listen very carefully.
邦妮，我是尼克       留心听我说

914
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:37,610
Transfer 7.78 billion yen from the client account to the house account tomorrow.
从客户中取七十七亿八千万日圆  转到公司的户口内

915
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,200
But it won't go!
但资金不足怎进行交易

916
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,090
There isn't enough money.
但资金不足怎进行交易

917
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:45,560
I know that, but then you can reverse it. It's just an electronic transaction.
我知，但可以立刻转回去

918
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:48,560
But I want the transfer done. And I want the bank...
只是电子交易  我需要进行

919
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:53,360
...to send us a fax of the statement, showing the 7.78 billion yen credit.
要在银行月结上  看到这宗交易

920
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,360
All right, Nick. If you say so.
好的，尼克，就这样办

921
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,010
Cheers, Bonnie.
谢谢你

922
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,680
Nick?
尼克

923
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,960
What's all this about seven billion yen?
那七十亿怎么了？

924
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:08,000
Someone from London, Tony Hawes, was looking for you.
有个叫东尼的人从伦敦来电找你

Jesus Christ, if I hear any more about this seven billion yen...
我不想再听到这七十亿元的事

926
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,840
It's about $70 million, innit?
这是天文数字

927
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,800
What do you reckon? Red or blue?
怎么了？蓝或红

928
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:18,680
You think I just walked off with $70 million?
以为我盗取这七十亿

929
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,160
I didn't say that.
我没说

930
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,200
It's a computer error.
是电脑出错

931
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:27,230
You need someone in the back office, I told you. You're not bloomin' Superman!
需要人协助文职工作   说过你不是超人

932
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,960
Don't start all that again.
丽莎，别吵架

933
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,320
It wouldn't have happened if I'd been there.

Right. I'm goin' out.

If anyone calls, tell 'em I've gone to South America.

938
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,030
Twat!

01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,200
What have you done now, Leeson?
利森，干什么

940
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,270
What have you done now?

Come in.

尼克把文件交了   他们很满意    谢谢

945
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:08,910
Technically we've breached SIMEX rules, but it was just a non-transaction.
技术上是违反    新加坡市场规例

946
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:10,550
With any luck...
但基本上没有进行过交易

947
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:15,100
...the auditors won't mention it, or we may have problems with the local regulator.
希望核数师不会提到这点   否则监察机构会找麻烦

948
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,420
Sounds sensible.
言之有理

949
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:22,510
Do you know, Nick made $10 million doing arbitrage in a week?
知道尼克一周内赚到一千万吗

950

That's about... half a billion dollars a year.

The guy's a turbo arbitrageur!
他是钞票印刷机

952
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:31,380
If he's doing that amount of business for that amount of profit,...
以他赚钱的速度

953
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:35,100
...why don't we shut down the rest of the bank? We're just overhead.
为何不索性把银行关掉了  连运作也省却

954
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:36,750
Yeah!
对

955
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,820
- Hello? - Nick,...

01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:53,630
Sorry, Tony, it's been chaos.
东尼，对不起，我们忙于核数

958
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:56,100
The audit went through. I thought you knew.
东尼，对不起，我们忙于核数

是SLK的事    已经查清楚

I know. What's bothering me is where you got all the money to actually...
我知道  你如何有钱支付给SLK

961

...well, pay SLK in the first place.
你如何有钱支付给SLK

962

总数共七千八百万元呢

963
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:11,140
It doesn't add up, you know.
这项数目不对

964
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:17,220
It's obvious. It's part of the funding we've had from you over the past few weeks.
东尼，钱是你数星期批给我们的

965
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:18,340
Yes.
是    全数我会汇回给你

966
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,820
So, the same figure will flow back to you.
是    全数我会汇回给你

967
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:26,140
I see. You're saying that some of the funding was used to pay SLK?
我明白  你是说那些钱一向都给SLK吗

968
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:29,700
That's right, Tony. So we'll be able to pay it back to you.
对，所以我们有能力还款给你

969
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:33,060
That'll be good. Er... getting our funding down will be good.
很好   请尽快把钱交给我们

970
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,380
I'm having to juggle quite a few balls.
我还要处理其他问题

971
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,580
We all are, Tony. Look, I've got to dash.

Are you anywhere near a TV?

01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:34,460
...and expensive. Mike Chinoy, CNN, reporting live from Tokyo.

股市下跌三百点，我们有难了

“吹波”  ，我认为是机会

法兰度，神户的情况怎样

他不按规条办事，不遵守规例

霸菱银行要聘请这样的人吗

东尼，别管规条 像尼克这小子才能令伦敦反转

若是真的，那班老鬼必定杀了你

这是秘密  来吧，我是自己人

I should have been able to relax after that,...
办完事后  我可以好好休息

但我不停在想那个幸运户口

1093
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:11,450
Shame you can't stay for the match on Saturday.
真可惜，你不能欣赏周六的比赛

发现那是个错误户口

1107
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:10,240
...and you'll realise it's concealing losses in the region of 200 million.
用来掩饰亚洲区内  二亿英镑的损失

1108
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:14,880
No, I tell a lie. It's more like 230 after today!
我说谎  到今天损失不止这个数

Man, look at the state you're in. You got the bloody shakes!

我不是开玩笑    你真够运

Five for a thousand, five for a thousand! Come on!
一千放五手...

再损失金钱但始终未能扭转局面

继续令他们损失金钱就不堪设想

是缅甸苏丹的来电
