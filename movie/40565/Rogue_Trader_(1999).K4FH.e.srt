1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,510
(newsreader)... denied reports the British
banking system is about to collapse.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,990
According to him, Barings' failure
is a unique situation...

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,950
...which he blames on the actions
of a rogue trader in Singapore.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,430
Estimates of potential losses range from
800 million to over one billion pounds.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,510
(bulletin continues)

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,630
Leftfield: "Open Up"

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,310
Look at that!

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,390
Will you fuckin' look at that!

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,430
- What, with the black guy?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,710
It's a shame. She looks well spoken for.

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,900
Never know your luck, though. Eh, mate?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,700
- Think I'll give her the treatment!
- No, Steve, no. Don't do that.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,710
- No, you're all right.
- Don't do that. Steve. Steve!

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,550
Hello, love.
I've got something to show ya.

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,710
Are you out of your mind or what?
You fuckin' little prick!

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,750
And I mean little!

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,220
Don't judge a book
by its cover, sweetheart.

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,110
- You're out of your league, arsehole.
- Calm down.

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,950
Fuck off or you're dead!

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,830
- I want you out of here, now.
- He's really sorry.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,030
He's pissed. He meant no disrespect.
That's the last thing on anybody's mind.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,630
Tell him if he doesn't
put that thing away...

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,590
...l'll rip it off and shove it
down his fuckin' throat!

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,220
Do your flies up, you fuckin' animal.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,260
- (cackles)
- Just leave it. It's not worth it!

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,550
He's done it again. I had to pull him off!

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,390
Fuckin' right laugh!

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,070
Aagghh! Aagghh!

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,310
Nick! Nick!

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,390
You all right? Nick!

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,060
It was thanks to Maggie Thatcher
opening up the City of London...

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,630
...that yours truly from Watford came to be
working for a posh outfit like Barings.

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,310
That was me lying on the floor,
if you hadn't guessed. Nick Leeson.

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,390
You've probably heard about me.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,310
Barings was the oldest
private bank in the world.

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,950
They financed the Louisiana Purchase
back in eighteen hundred and something.

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,110
They even had the Queen as a customer!

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,670
I was just a humble clerk.

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,670
But not for long, I hoped.

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,310
Car crash.

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,550
I hit my head on the back
of the seat and broke my nose.

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,790
Everybody else was all right cos they
were wearing their, um... seat belts.

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,870
Poor chap!

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,830
Nick, I know you're keen to get out of the
back office and onto the trading floor...

45
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,910
...but in the meantime
something else has come up.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,510
We've got problems in our Jakarta office.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,670
We need someone to go out there
and sort things out.

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,670
I thought that someone might be...

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,270
...Nick Leeson?

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,030
Indonesia was one of
the new "tiger economies"...

51
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,550
...everyone was getting so excited about.

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,310
"Emerging markets"
they were calling them...

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,670
...and Barings was one of the first
to see their potential.

54
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,310
The rewards were high.
But so were the risks.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,870
One hundred million pounds...

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,630
...in bearer bonds.

57
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,270
As good as cash.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,230
We could pick 'em up, walk out...

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,990
...come to some arrangement
with laughing boy...

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,950
Customers refuse to pay for them.

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,030
They say what's on them
doesn't match the original deal.

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,550
The real reason: The market goes down,
they don't want any more.

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,470
It's a mess.

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,270
You're absolutely 100 per cent right,
Susi. It's one hell of a fuckin' mess.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,350
It was my job to sort out
the certificates...

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,710
...so customers wouldn't have
any more excuses not to pay.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,670
Until then, Barings had this bloody
great hole in their balance sheet.

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,790
It was boring work,
but I knew if I made a success of it...

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,830
...then I could write my own ticket.

70
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,790
All the certificates
are in the right denomination.

71
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,630
I've sorted out all the documentation.
That's all in order now, so...

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,430
...all I need from you...

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,230
...is a cheque!

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,030
Hello. I'm Lisa.

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,990
I'm, um... Nick Leeson. Can I help you?

76
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,590
Barings sent me
to help with the settlements.

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,230
Didn't they tell you?

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,710
Oh, of course! I've been on at them for so
long I never thought they'd get round to it.

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,100
What do we do with that lot?
Build a bonfire?

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,510
I'd never even heard of Barings
before I started working for 'em.

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,900
It's not like there's a Barings in Watford.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,590
You're a hero in London. They think
the sun shines out of your arse.

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,750
Really? I was beginning to feel like
one of those Japanese soldiers.

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,030
Still stuck out in the jungle
20 years after the war!

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,310
What's it like here?
They tell me it's not safe at night.

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,350
Bollocks. The locals are great.

87
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,510
And it's not full of pompous ex-colonials
thinking they were born to rule the world.

88
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,430
That's what I love about Asia.

89
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,550
Anyone can make it.
Doesn't matter which school you went to.

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,230
When they told me I was going to
Jakarta I had to look it up on the map.

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,510
As a matter of fact, so did I.

92
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,630
I really want to be a trader.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,670
If Barings don't let me
on the floor after this, I'm off.

94
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,590
- Not gonna be bloody clerking all my life.
- Ooh! Ambitious, aren't we?

95
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,590
- Is that bad?
- It's great.

96
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,510
I just want to get on in life.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,550
I like to enjoy myself, don't get me wrong.
Work hard, play hard.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,990
Well, I think this is me.

99
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,190
Well, night, Nick. That was fun.

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,540
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
- (door bleeps)

101
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,310
- OK. Night-night!
- See you tomorrow, then.

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,310
Lisa was a stunner all right.

103
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,350
Love at first sight.

104
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,750
Together we made short work
of the rest of those bonds.

105
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,110
Soon we cleared up most of Barings'
losses and it was time to go home.

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,910
See you later, Lisa.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,030
Bye.

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,590
(laughs)

109
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,110
I think you'll agree that in Nick
Lisa has met her prince.

110
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,790
(guests) Hear! Hear!

111
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,310
Join me in wishing them well
in their new life in Singapore...

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,070
...where Nick is to be general manager of
the trading floor. Whatever that means.

113
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,070
- It impressed the hell out of me, but...
- (laughter)

114
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,430
And, um...

115
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,830
To you, Nick, I'm entrusting
the most precious of gifts.

116
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,750
I know you're gonna look after her
and cherish her...

117
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,400
...and all those other things.
And if you don't...

118
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,550
...l'll break your bloody legs, all right?

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,950
(woman) He means it!

120
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,590
I love you so much, Lisa Leeson.

121
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,870
I love you too, Nick.

122
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,950
(cheering)

123
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,830
As a reward for Jakarta I'd been given the
far more important market of Singapore...

124
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,430
...with a brief to set
up my own trading operation.

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,310
I was definitely on my way.

126
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,190
DJ Rap: "Good To Be Alive"

127
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,710
- And the kitchen...
- This is your department, darling.

128
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,790
Since when? Cheeky!

129
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,270
And the bedroom...

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,950
- If you need anything, call me.
- Right, thanks.

131
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,990
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks. Bye.

132
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,070
- Goodbye.
- (door shuts)

133
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,920
Not bad for a chancer from Watford, eh?

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,350
Well, um... I think we should
test out that mattress, big boy.

135
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,430
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

136
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,070
(Lisa) Whoo!

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,270
I can't see any problem in you
handling both sides of the operation.

138
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
- At least until volumes increase.
- Right.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,790
You shouldn't need more than two
on the trading floor.

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,790
A couple more in the back office.

141
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,710
No need to pay top dollar.

142
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,550
Get them young, get them hungry
and train them up.

143
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,190
- I'm a bottom line kind of guy, Nick.
- Absolutely. That's my philosophy.

144
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,710
I took him at his word.
My team were young, hungry...

145
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,510
...and they didn't have a clue.

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,390
A futures contract allows you to buy or
sell a specified amount of a commodity...

147
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,860
...at a specified price at a future date.

148
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,190
Right. Um...

149
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,790
It's like, if I agree to sell you this cup
of cappuccino, which I don't yet own...

150
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,910
...at 45 cents a month from now...

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,190
If I can buy the cappuccino at,
say, 43 cents, I make a profit.

152
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,590
If the price goes the other way
I have to pay more, and I lose.

153
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,550
It's timing - buying and selling
at the right moment.

154
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,870
Sometimes espresso might be
the best deal, or salt, or pepper.

155
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,030
So, we're running a supermarket?

156
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,590
We're not buying and selling
anything real.

157
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,190
It's just numbers - contracts
based on the value of the Nikkei...

158
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,990
...the Tokyo stock market.

159
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,430
- Er, we do this for the bank?
- No, no, for the customers.

160
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,470
We are not allowed to trade
on behalf of the bank.

161
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,990
Be sure you remember that, all right?

162
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,710
Other dealers wear red jackets. All same.
Red is lucky Chinese colour.

163
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,670
Well, we want to stand out. We're a
new operation. We need to be noticed.

164
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,710
May be bad luck. Different colour.

165
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,710
Bollocks. We make our own luck.

166
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,070
Nick's right.
We're cool dudes, man. Whoo!

167
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,470
(Nick chuckles)

168
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,590
Barrett Strong:
"Money (That's What I Want)"

169
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,150
(roar of voices)

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,560
Fernando. Anything happening in Tokyo?

171
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,390
Nothin'. How's SIMEX?

172
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,550
Same here. No one's playin'.

173
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,630
590, and trading small.

174
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,510
600, and thin too.

175
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,950
580 here. There's a seller who wants
to trade in size. Shall I low-tick him?

176
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,630
Yeah. Flush him out.

177
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,070
- Squeeze the sucker.
- How many?

178
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,470
200.

179
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,230
Buy them... now.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,670
- Buy 'em!
- Filled!

181
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,590
We paid 580 for 200.

182
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,060
Way to go, Nick! I sold at 590.

183
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,260
Fuck a duck! Just made 2,000 quid.

184
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,990
Yes!

185
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,070
"Money" continues

186
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,710
They were a good bunch
and they were keen to learn.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,070
It looked like a madhouse with
all the traders waving and shouting...

188
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,030
...but it all made sense
once you got the hang of it.

189
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,190
There were hiccups,
but that's normal in any operation...

190
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,950
...especially a new one like ours.

191
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,790
The important thing was
we were picking up the business...

192
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,870
...and the future looked rosy.

193
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,990
Nick, what's the difference between
initial margin and variation margin?

194
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,030
Initial margin's a down payment
on each futures contract that we trade.

195
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,390
We don't pay in full
until a contract matures.

196
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,150
But in the meantime the value of
each contract may go up or down.

197
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,390
So SIMEX calculate our positions
on a daily basis.

198
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,710
They'll ask for more money if the market
goes against us. That's variation margin.

199
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,180
Got it. I think!

200
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,950
We need to open an errors account.
We've had a few mistakes.

201
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,150
I need somewhere to put them
till I can write them out.

202
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,830
Sure. What number shall I give it?

203
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,750
- Well, what's your lucky number?
- Eight. It is a very lucky Chinese number.

204
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,270
And how many numbers do we need?

205
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,500
Five.

206
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,710
Then let's give it all the luck it can handle.
Call it the 88888 account.

207
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,310
And now it gives me great pleasure to
welcome the chairman of Barings Bank...

208
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,630
...Peter Baring.

209
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,790
We may be the oldest
merchant bank in the world...

210
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,830
...but that's no excuse for
not keeping up with the times.

211
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,870
When I became chairman...

212
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,350
...I realised we couldn't go on running
Barings like a gentlemen's club.

213
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,710
We had to look beyond
our traditional recruiting grounds...

214
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,870
...the old school tie...

215
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,030
...to seek out a new and hungrier breed.

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,430
We're beginning to see the fruits
of those efforts, and I have to say...

217
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,310
...the recovery in profitability, since
the reorganisation, has been... amazing.

218
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,030
To be frank, I've discovered
it's not actually terribly difficult...

219
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,830
...to make money
in the securities business!

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,220
Filled.

221
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,270
Yeah, you paid 50 for 20.

222
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,270
- (knock on door)
- Come in.

223
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,190
Simon, er... I've got a slight problem.

224
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,710
One of the girls sold 20 contracts
for Fuji Bank instead of buying.

225
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,950
I can't do anything about it till Monday.

226
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,510
What's the damage?

227
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,870
20,000 at the close.

228
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,550
Sack the cow.
She'll never work on SIMEX again.

229
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,110
That's a bit hard, isn't it?

230
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,230
Look, you handle it.

231
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,470
Have a word with London,
but make sure you make that client good.

232
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,350
All right.

233
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,070
Hey! Have a beer, shithead!

234
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,590
Cheers.

235
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,590
Hi, darling.

236
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,870
Anyone seen Kim?

237
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,230
She was here a minute ago.

238
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,550
Kim...

239
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,430
Nick, Nick...

240
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,510
I'm really sorry. I got so confused.

241
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,590
- Everybody was shouting all at once.
- That's the job.

242
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,630
That's what it's all about,
keeping a cool head.

243
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,020
I'm so sorry! I'll pay you back the money.

244
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,830
Sure, Kim. Four years' salary? And if
the market moves it could be even worse.

245
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,350
Come on, come on.

246
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,390
Come on, everyone makes mistakes.

247
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,710
Look, with a bit of luck I can
trade out of it on Monday, all right?

248
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,870
Nick, I've been waiting for you while
everyone else is having a good time.

249
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,950
- I'm going home now.
- Kim!

250
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,590
Kim!

251
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,150
- Everything all right?
- Never better.

252
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,070
Why don't you let me come in and help?
I can't sit around all day doing nothing.

253
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,150
It's not a problem, Lisa.

254
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,750
I can handle it.

255
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,190
Fernando, how are
March futures looking?

256
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,310
- I need 20 contracts at Friday's price.
- You won't get Friday's price!

257
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,430
I should have closed off the position
and taken the loss.

258
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,750
Instead, I waited for the market to
change.

259
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,270
It changed all right,
but not the way I wanted.

260
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,510
Now I was stuck with a bigger loss than
I could own up to. And it was all my fault.

261
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,590
Nick! I hear your girl handed in her notice.

262
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,140
Never came back.
She couldn't stand the pace.

263
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,870
So much for loyalty!

264
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,910
- Did you make the client good?
- Of course. Made a small profit, actually.

265
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,990
Good man.

266
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,870
(softly) This one's for
the five eights account.

267
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,990
I bought the missing contracts.

268
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,630
- Shh!
- It was only 20 before.

269
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,630
And the market went the wrong way.
I had to cut the loss.

270
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,670
What did Simon Jones say?

271
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,710
Are you serious?
He'd shut us down if he knew.

272
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,500
It'll be all right so long as we balance
the books by the end of the month.

273
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,630
- How?
- We trade on our own account...

274
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,790
...until we wipe out the losses, then
we use money from the client account...

275
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,260
...and pay it back with
next month's profits.

276
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,910
You mean, gamble?

277
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,830
(whispers) Relax, Bonnie.
That's all the market is.

278
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,110
One giant casino!

279
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,790
George!

280
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,750
I was counting on nobody looking at
the books until the end of each month.

281
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,830
As long as the five eights account had a
nil balance on the last day of the month...

282
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,710
...no one would suspect
that anything was wrong.

283
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,030
But instead of winning back
the position we made more losses...

284
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,990
...and I had to borrow more money
from the client account to hide them.

285
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,590
Fuckin' hell, George,
what are you playing at? Get fuckin' out!

286
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,670
Get fuckin' out! Now!

287
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,550
What the hell are you playing at?
Out! Get out!

288
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,590
Fuckin' hell!

289
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,190
- Agh.
- God, you're tense. Stiff as a board.

290
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,630
If you only knew! All cos those bastards
won't let me hire proper staff.

291
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,310
- I thought it was going so well.
- It is. It's going brilliant.

292
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,830
I just spend most of my life
covering everybody else's arse.

293
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,830
Well, why don't you let me
help with the back office?

294
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,300
- I'm bored being a lady of leisure.
- No.

295
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,630
Why not? It's ridiculous, you having
to handle trading and settlements.

296
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,630
You'll have a nervous breakdown.

297
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,100
I don't want you interfering.
I can handle it.

298
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,870
All right, keep your pants on!
No one's saying you can't.

299
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,870
I'm not going back to being
a bloody clerk. I'd rather be a plasterer.

300
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,710
My mum always used to say
I could be anything I wanted...

301
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,550
...so long as I took my chances -
and worked like a dog.

302
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,910
Well, you have.
You've worked really hard and it paid off.

303
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,790
She'd have been so proud of you.

304
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,110
Do you really think so?

305
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,310
Yeah.

306
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,190
I know I am!

307
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,870
That was the worst part -
Lisa thinking I was this brilliant success.

308
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,910
If she only knew
what a fuck-up I really was!

309
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,430
When I wanted the market
to go up, it went down.

310
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,590
If I wanted it to go down, it went up.

311
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,430
It was hard not to take it personally.

312
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,350
Nick?

313
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,790
Nick! I just worked out the balance
in the eights account.

314
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,630
- The losses are over $10 million!
- Keep your fuckin' voice down!

315
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,710
Look, there's no need to panic.

316
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,270
There's not enough in the client account
to make margin payments, Nick.

317
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,070
(softly) Right.

318
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,150
I need dollars. I need dollars
to cover the initial margin payment!

319
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,510
I can get dollars from London to cover all
the client positions for the futures I buy!

320
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,300
Nothing unusual about that.
But I'm gonna need yen.

321
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,430
Gonna need yen to cover
the daily variation columns!

322
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,710
Which'll leave a yen deficit
by the end of the month.

323
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,070
Unless... unless I sell options.

324
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,860
That'll generate commission in yen.

325
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,550
And return the balance sheet
on the five eights account to zero!

326
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,750
As long as London kept sending out
money to finance the client positions...

327
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,310
...l'd have enough cash to stay
on top of the margin payments.

328
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,510
It was like robbing Peter to pay Paul...

329
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,310
...but hopefully I'd end up making enough
to pay Peter back before he found out.

330
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,030
Meanwhile I had to generate more and
more business to justify my cash calls...

331
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,270
...and for that I needed customers.

332
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,550
The bigger the better.

333
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,110
Mm-hm. Oui.

334
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,990
Bon, tres bien.

335
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,790
Mr Leeson.

336
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,310
- I'm Pierre Beaumarchais.
- Nice to meet you.

337
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,630
I work for the Geneva Banking Trust,
based in the Bahamas.

338
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,710
I was speaking with Ang Swee Tian,
president of SIMEX.

339
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,310
He's impressed by the amount of
business you've been generating.

340
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,990
- There's a lot of opportunities here.
- Oh, yes.

341
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,030
I do a lot of business on SIMEX.

342
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,790
With the exception of George Soros...

343
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,790
...I probably trade in the Nikkei
more than anyone.

344
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,950
Sometimes over 5,000 contracts in a day.

345
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,470
That is a lot.
The whole market only does about 20.

346
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,830
Could Barings handle
that amount of business?

347
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,230
You bet we could!

348
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,880
Beaumarchais was
the answer to my prayers.

349
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,520
I'd be able to siphon off
enough commission...

350
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,910
...to square the eights account
once and for all.

351
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,310
- Hello?
- Pierre Beaumarchais.

352
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,910
I want to buy 4,000 June contracts.

353
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,150
I've... got a price of 350,
but this'll move it.

354
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,750
Try not to pay more than 400.

355
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,670
We gotta get them cheap.
Beaumarchais is a big player.

356
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,350
If we pull this off,
we get a shitload of business.

357
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,000
- What's liquidity like?
- Tight as a flea's arse.

358
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,750
We'll get away with 500,
then the price will move up.

359
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,110
OK. But then we'll make the other
traders think we're sellers.

360
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,500
And when the price drops... buy! All right?

361
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,190
OK.

362
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,150
Sell 250!

363
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,950
Sell 250! Sell 250!

364
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,790
Sell 240!

365
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,390
Sell 240! Sell 240!

366
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,950
Sell 200! Sell 200!

367
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,300
- Buy 500 contracts!
- Sell 200!

368
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,110
Buy? Buy?

369
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,150
Buy at 200! Buy at 200! Buy at 210!

370
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,230
Buy at 210! Buy at 220!

371
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,630
Buy at 220! Buy at 230!

372
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,230
Buy at 240!

373
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,310
Buy at 240! Buy at 240!

374
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,590
Filled!

375
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,190
Nobody saw us coming! We swooped
on the first 1500 like a Stealth bomber!

376
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,110
4,000 contracts!

377
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,190
Balls of steel, Fat Boy.
Balls of fuckin' steel!

378
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,150
Andy Williams:
"Can't Take My Eyes Off You"

379
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,910
At last my luck had changed.
Suddenly I couldn't stop making money.

380
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,790
I was long in the Nikkei - that meant
gambling on it going up - and up it went.

381
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,870
Up and up and up.

382
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,830
That's very good! Very good.

383
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,110
Serves you right, Lisa!

384
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,150
If it went all the way up to 19,000, I stood
to make a killing on the options I'd sold.

385
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,990
Come on, come on!
Come on, baby, you can do it. Come on.

386
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,630
- Yes!
- Yes!

387
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,030
Bonnie, we're on a fuckin' roll!

388
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,110
Yes!

389
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,990
Do you think we'll do it?

390
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,070
(bell rings)

391
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,110
It's amazing!
You've made back all the losses.

392
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,430
- Over $10 million.
- What did I tell you? Oh, ye of little faith!

393
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,230
You keep doubling up,
and sooner or later...

394
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,350
...you're bound to win.

395
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,310
"Jingle Bells"

396
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,350
The Nikkei has closed up
for the third day in a row...

397
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,870
...and the rally shows little sign
of running out of steam.

398
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,430
Analysts are predicting
additional gains in the days ahead.

399
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,510
(bulletin continues)

400
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,590
- Happy?
- Yeah. Are you?

401
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,510
Never better.

402
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,350
I have been sailing a bit close to the wind.
I didn't want to worry you with it.

403
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,150
- What do you mean?
- No, it's all right.

404
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,750
The market turned round and a whole
load of my positions came good.

405
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,710
I made it all back.

406
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,790
What are you on about, Nick?

407
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,350
Don't get your knickers in a twist, but we
made mistakes and ran up some losses.

408
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,820
I went out on a limb
to get back the position.

409
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,750
How big were the losses?

410
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,350
- It's about a million.
- A million quid?!

411
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,110
For God's sake, Nick!

412
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,470
No, it's all right. It paid off.
I squared it up.

413
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,990
I had to do it to protect the guys.

414
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,750
Promise me that you'll
never do that again.

415
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,400
- It's not worth it, Nick.
- I promise.

416
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,190
You will give me a heart attack.

417
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,990
(they laugh)

418
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,750
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

419
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,750
(cheering)

420
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,550
Fuck off!

421
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,310
I really meant it. I was the number one
trader, and as the new year came in...

422
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,750
...I was determined to kick
my addiction to the eights account.

423
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,710
What will the market do? Long-term?

424
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,470
No one thinks long-term,
they think nanoseconds!

425
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,230
- Long-term's tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow, then.

426
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,070
- That would be telling.
- Leeson speaks, the market moves!

427
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,150
You said it, mate.

428
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,390
Pierre.

429
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,790
I want to sell the 220 call options
and buy the 200 calls in December.

430
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,910
I've got an offer of.138 for size.

431
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,870
Can you do better?

432
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,590
I'll get back to you.

433
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,270
Quick as you can, Nick.
I have to move fast.

434
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,990
Oui, oui, je suis toujours la.

435
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,950
What the hell is he on about,
.138 for size?

436
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,310
The market in 220 calls is down.
He wants to cut his losses.

437
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,070
- Yeah, but why.138?
- It's a ratio.

438
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,430
The 200 calls are trading at 1,400.

439
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,390
Divide 200 by 1,400, you get.143.

440
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,860
All right. But not.138.

441
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,310
Unless someone's offered him a discount.
Probably Societe Generale.

442
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,150
We can't let those wankers
get our biggest client.

443
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,700
- What are you gonna do?
- Just have to leg it.

444
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,340
Buy the contracts from Pierre
and sell them when the market rises?

445
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,430
I thought we were not supposed
to trade for the bank.

446
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,470
Pierre? I can do it. What's the exact size?

447
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,270
6,500? All right, leave it with me.
No problem.

448
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,110
What if the market doesn't rise, uh?
What if it falls?

449
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,590
I've gambled and won before.
I can gamble and win again.

450
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,300
Balls of steel, me old mateys,
and you'd better believe it.

451
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,190
Bonnie, I need you to
reopen the eights account.

452
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,150
We got caned on
Beaumarchais' contracts.

453
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,510
Now the bastard's gone back
to Societe Generale.

454
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,870
Fax Brenda Granger in London. Ask her
for funds to cover the margin payments.

455
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,950
Tell her it's for client positions.

456
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,910
- (internal phone)
- Hello?

457
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,110
It's Simon.
Can you come into my office?

458
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,670
Right away.

459
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,910
Christ, I'd been rumbled!
The only surprise was it'd taken so long.

460
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,070
What was I gonna tell Lisa?
She'd bloody murder me.

461
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,150
- (knock on door)
- Come in.

462
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,750
Congratulations, Nick.

463
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,230
The '93 bonuses are in,
and you're down for 135 grand.

464
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,790
135? That's fantastic!

465
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,590
Your little operation generated profits of
over ¡ê10 million last year. You're a star!

466
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,780
In fact, your figures are so high
they're going to check up on you.

467
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,750
Check up on me?

468
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,790
They're sending Ash Lewis out
for the audit.

469
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,950
Don't worry. It's purely routine.

470
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,990
Ash Lewis?

471
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,830
She's meant to be
a right ball-breaker, isn't she?

472
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,430
That's our booth.

473
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,190
Filled! You paid 250.

474
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,110
Hi, Nick.

475
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,190
Ron Baker and Ash Lewis.

476
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,660
Ron is head of Derivatives Trading
in London.

477
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,790
Which I guess makes me your boss, Nick.

478
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,710
- How do you, Mr Leeson?
- Very well, thank you.

479
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,870
OK. Let's see the action!

480
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,100
Henry!

481
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,590
(Baker) Who's doing all the business?
We're the biggest, right?

482
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,590
We do a lot of arbitrage,
so we do have a high volume.

483
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,670
We signal orders in to George
in the pit - this is Henry -

484
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,620
...and at the end of the day the girls in the
office log all the deals on to the computer.

485
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,110
(Lewis) You manage the trading floor
and the settlements office, is that right?

486
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,030
Yes, yes.

487
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,110
That's a little unusual. Whatever
happened to checks and balances?

488
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,110
- That's something we need to talk about.
- I'll be here for three weeks.

489
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,070
This is going to be a thoroughly
comprehensive audit. No stone unturned.

490
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,710
Absolutely. Anything I can do to help,
any stone needs turning, let me know.

491
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,670
Are we filled? Good man, Henry.

492
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,550
Nice to see you, Simon.

493
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,550
Dad's seen this flat in Blackheath.

494
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,910
Needs a bit of work, but him
and my granddad can fix it up.

495
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,310
Think of it like an insurance policy
in case you get sacked...

496
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,180
...have to go back to England
and work as a plasterer! (laughs)

497
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,030
What's up with you, misery-guts?

498
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,350
What would you do, Lise?
What would you do if I did get the elbow?

499
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,310
You've just been given
a ruddy great big bonus.

500
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,350
But what if it all went wrong? What if
I'm not as clever as everyone thinks?

501
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,270
Oh, of course you are!

502
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,150
Anyway, it's you I love.
I don't give a toss about the money.

503
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,950
If it was up to me we'd jack it all in now,
go back to England and start a family.

504
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,070
You're doing brilliantly, Nick.

505
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,990
You're a bloody star.

506
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,790
- Nick!
- (softly) Fuck!

507
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,310
Simon!

508
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,310
- You're looking disgustingly chirpy.
- Haven't you heard? Panic over.

509
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,550
- Ash has been called back to London.
- You're kidding. Why?

510
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,670
Office politics. Some turf battle
between Futures and Securities.

511
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,270
- And what about the audit?
- They'll send Mark Taylor and Chris Carr.

512
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,150
Compared to Ash
they're a couple of pussies.

513
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,550
Pity. I was rather looking forward to
seeing the dreaded Ash Lewis in action!

514
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,070
(whispers) Yes!

515
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,070
No, I'm just leaving now.

516
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,830
I'm gonna jump in the shower.
If you get home first, put the oven on.

517
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,620
- All right, sweetheart. I'll see you then.
- Bye, darling.

518
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,070
(cackles)

519
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,310
- Get in, you bastard!
- What the fuck is that?

520
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,180
Sex on wheels.
It's a Porsche, moron! Get in!

521
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,430
I'll tell you what it is.

522
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,510
It's disgustin'.

523
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,030
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a great big hard-on!

524
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,230
Got to think of something
to do with my bonus.

525
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,910
You keep your eyes on the road,
you flash git!

526
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,030
Jerry Lee Lewis: "Great Balls Of Fire"

527
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,630
Whoo!

528
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,510
- It's a fuckin' one-way street, George.
- Whoops!

529
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,940
Goodness, gracious, great balls of steel!

530
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,670
- Whoo!
- Fuckin' George!

531
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,710
Shit! There's that Reuters journalist.

532
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,710
Nick! Nick!

533
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,790
He's been bugging me
for weeks for an interview.

534
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,910
- Hey, Nick!
- All right, mate?

535
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,230
Nick, my man. What'll you have?

536
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,830
Oh, a beer, please. You know
George Seow, one of my dealers?

537
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,270
This is Danny
from Intercontinental Trading.

538
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,510
- Just been sent from the London office.
- Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

539
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,220
I hear Barings have almost cornered
the market here, thanks to you.

540
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,750
The rumours have been
greatly exaggerated.

541
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,670
Don't be so modest.

542
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,700
He's king of the exchange! Barings got an
award for all the business he's generated.

543
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,950
- Do you want a beer?
- I'd love a beer.

544
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,190
Aagghh!

545
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,070
(canned laughter)

546
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,150
(shouting, laughter)

547
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,670
(music, drunken shouting)

548
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,230
(Nick) Watch the Drambuie settle.

549
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,750
And it's called depth charge.

550
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,750
It's guaranteed to blow
your fuckin' head off.

551
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,110
Are you ready?

552
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,350
Let's do it. Let's have it.

553
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,750
One!

554
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,630
And two!

555
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,470
And three!

556
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,550
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

557
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,470
Hey! Pretty women!
What are you waiting for?

558
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,150
Come on!

559
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,830
- Come on!
- Tough shit, George.

560
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,300
Your charm's just not working tonight.

561
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,470
Stuck-up bitches!

562
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,830
- I bet they're Singapore air hostesses.
- Flight lieutenants, if you don't mind!

563
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,910
Chocks away!

564
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,710
Flight lieutenants!

565
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,270
Help 'em to decide if they wanna come in
or if they don't wanna come in.

566
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,430
Let's give 'em a hand and moon 'em!

567
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,350
That should help 'em decide.
Come on, don't be shy!

568
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,590
Your mother wasn't!

569
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,550
I love this man.

570
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,390
- On three?
- It worked before.

571
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,230
It could work again. One...

572
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,550
Two! Three!

573
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,830
Bottoms up!

574
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,590
That is disgusting!

575
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,630
Whoo!

576
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,990
(Danny) What'll it be, you old bastard?

577
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,830
Absolutely brilliant, Nick!
Drinks are on me.

578
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,590
Enough depth charges
to sink a battleship!

579
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,950
- Fuck, what time is it?
- I don't know.

580
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,470
Got to phone Lisa.

581
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,350
Oh, you've got to be jokin'!

582
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,470
No laughing matter.

583
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,870
Outraging a lady's modesty...
very serious crime in Singapore.

584
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,870
News of my disgrace reached London.
At the highest level.

585
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,270
It's slightly embarrassing,
but one of our traders got drunk...

586
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,070
...and pulled a moon.

587
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,030
What did you say?

588
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,790
He exposed his bottom.

589
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,430
(laughter)

590
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,110
- Why?
- Playing silly buggers, I expect.

591
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,740
Unfortunately, the law over there
takes rather a dim view.

592
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,750
Maybe we should sack him.

593
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,910
Sacking him would be...
awkward, to say the least.

594
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,190
He generates a significant amount
of our profits in Southeast Asia.

595
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,310
I, er... ought to mention we're getting
stick from the Bank of England...

596
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,270
...about our funding over there.

597
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,710
Technically we're in breach of regulations
on the ratio of lending to capital.

598
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,310
Would you like me to have
a quiet word in their ear?

599
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,350
Oh, we're not quite there yet.

600
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,110
When I spoke to Andy Dixon
at the Bank, he said the matter was...

601
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,270
..."buried reasonably deep in his in-tray".

602
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,110
Just flagging a concern.

603
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,110
Quite right. It's something
we should keep an eye on.

604
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,230
Well... is that it? Any other business?

605
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,870
Well, what about this chap Leeson?
He of the exhibitionist tendencies.

606
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,670
I suppose it's something we should
leave to the Singapore authorities.

607
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,070
I have to say... I'm inclined to agree.

608
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,270
So, it was the profits that saved me.

609
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,270
If they only knew!

610
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,910
Nick!

611
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,790
That guy from Reuters again.
The second time today.

612
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,870
Tell him I've...

613
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,950
Oh, fuck it! Gimme the phone.

614
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,860
Print me up a balance
on the eights account.

615
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,150
Hi, Loy.

616
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,750
Nick! You're a hard man to pin down.

617
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,110
You know how it is.
What can I do you for?

618
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,390
- Quite a position you've been buying.
- We're happy.

619
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,780
I don't know how the client
wants to play it.

620
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,660
Who is this mystery client, Nick?
He must have rather large balls.

621
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,270
I'm sorry, mate.
Client confidentiality and all that.

622
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,350
Is it Pierre Beaumarchais?

623
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,780
Sorry, Loy, I... gotta go.
I'll speak to you later.

624
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,870
Speak to you some other time.

625
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,020
Jesus Christ, Bonnie. It's 7.78 billion yen!

626
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,150
- Do you want the dollar amount? It's...
- Yeah, yeah, $77.8 million.

627
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,510
Book me the following notional trade.

628
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,910
Selling 1,000 December 21,500
put options at a price of... 7778.

629
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,830
Then print me a new report after that
entry so it shows 7.78 billion yen...

630
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,030
...as if it was owing to us from SIMEX.
- Sure, Nick.

631
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,710
Then fax Brenda Granger in London,
asking for more funds.

632
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,990
Say we've had a large margin call
on our client positions.

633
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,390
How much?

634
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,430
A million.

635
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,030
Make it two.

636
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,030
(phone rings)

637
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,390
- Nick!
- Mm?

638
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,630
Nick, it's the phone.

639
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,590
- Hello?
- (Baker) I'm not disturbing you, am I?

640
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,150
It's 2am.

641
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,310
Oh, Christ. Sorry, mate. Had no idea.

642
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,710
The old farts are getting nervous. They
want you to unwind the position a little.

643
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,070
That's easier said than done. Don't want
to send the wrong signal to the market.

644
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,110
Yeah, yeah.

645
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,470
Second, we need another ¡ê2 million profit
by next month to secure our bonuses.

646
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,150
Two million? Ron, what planet
do you live on, mate?

647
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,870
One minute you want me
to unwind the positions...

648
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,910
Failure is not an option, mate.

649
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,030
See you at the junket in London
in three weeks' time.

650
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,470
Who do they think I am, George Soros?

651
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,790
We were close to the end of another year
and I was deeper in the shit than ever.

652
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,870
Barings wanted me to speak at their
annual group conference in London.

653
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,070
I was their star trader, and they wanted
to know the secrets of my success.

654
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,150
It didn't bear thinking about.

655
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,430
(TV on low)

656
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,270
- Is Nan staying with Auntie Karen?
- Yeah.

657
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,150
- It's the best place she could be.
- Aww, poor thing.

658
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,750
(phone rings)

659
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,030
- Has she been crying?
- Mm.

660
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,790
Has she?

661
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,190
Hello?

662
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,030
Nick! It's for you.

663
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,110
Ron Baker.

664
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,070
Ron! Can't believe you
tracked me down already.

665
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,310
Listen, with this conference you'll be
away from the trading floor a long time.

666
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,230
I had to come back a week early
for this funeral.

667
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,270
- I told you, Lisa's granddad passed away.
- I'm sorry about that, mate...

668
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,110
...but I'm fighting for your bonus.
You need to keep up those profits.

669
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,310
- I couldn't miss this funeral.
- No one's asking you to!

670
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,550
I'll issue you a pass so you can come in
on Sunday and trade through the night.

671
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,590
You won't miss a thing!

672
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,830
Get out the fuckin' way!

673
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,950
If he's working this hard
he's going to need his food.

674
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,310
He wants me to go into the office
on Sunday night and trade.

675
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,070
Well... no!

676
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,750
That's completely out of order.
Let someone else make the profits!

677
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,070
She's right, Nick. You're not a machine.

678
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,700
It's bonus time. If I don't deliver,
then everybody loses out.

679
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,230
It's not fair, Nick. You carry on at this rate,
you're gonna be in a right old state.

680
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,950
It's gonna be your funeral next.

681
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,110
For as much as it hath
pleased almighty God...

682
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,760
...of his great mercy to take unto himself...

683
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,550
...the soul of our dear brother
here departed...

684
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,590
...we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

685
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,710
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

686
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,510
...dust to dust.

687
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,950
Good to see you, son.
Sorry occasion, but there you go.

688
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,950
- He had a good innings.
- That's the main thing.

689
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,670
So how's it going over there?

690
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,990
- Can't complain.
- We're all proud of you.

691
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,310
- What you've achieved.
- It's no big deal.

692
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,230
Don't be so bloody modest!

693
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,510
You a plasterer's son!

694
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,630
I just wish your mum
could have been here to see it.

695
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,470
So do I.

696
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,870
(voice breaks)
I'll try not to let you all down, Dad.

697
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,110
- What did you say?
- It's OK, it's just jet lag.

698
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,190
Don't pay any attention to me.

699
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,750
(lift pings)

700
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,870
I felt sick going into the office...

701
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,950
...seeing all the people
I'd been avoiding for months.

702
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,060
It was one thing to con people over the
phone, quite another to do it to their face.

703
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,150
Nick? That's you, isn't it?

704
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,550
Nick Leeson? I heard you were coming
in.

705
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,830
You haven't the vaguest idea
who I am, have you?

706
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,700
Brenda?

707
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,550
- Of course. I'm sorry. How are you?
- So I finally get to put a face to the voice!

708
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,420
- My God, you are so young!
- Well, ageing rapidly, I'm afraid.

709
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,870
Can you come into my office? I really do
need to talk to you about the figures.

710
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,390
I'm meeting Peter Norris in three minutes.

711
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,670
Oh. Well, do come in right after, OK?

712
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,550
Nobody out there can answer
our questions but you.

713
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,830
And they just asked for
another ton of funding.

714
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,910
- All right. This one?
- Yeah.

715
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,710
Brenda was my cash lifeline.

716
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,150
She was the last person I wanted
asking awkward questions.

717
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,900
But first I had to deal with Peter Norris.

718
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,470
He's such a red-hot trader
I'm having him come in overnight!

719
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,190
Are you really?

720
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,710
You can't keep Nick away from the floor.
He's the key man in Singapore.

721
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,310
Sounds like you're the key man in Asia.

722
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,030
He's insane! You should see
how he takes that market on.

723
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,910
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Yes, it's all right.

724
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,990
(both) "All right"?

725
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,950
(they laugh)

726
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,110
Now, we need to talk about merging the
sales areas in Asia. Nick has some views.

727
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,590
If we can replicate his success
in Hong Kong and Tokyo...

728
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,510
What do you think, Nick?

729
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,750
It does make a lot of sense to merge.

730
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,310
There would need to be
controls, of course...

731
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,990
...but the trading books can be used to
supplement a customer's requirements...

732
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,380
...and increase information flows.

733
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,510
Synergetically.

734
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,430
Exactly. Synergy.

735
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,630
So you see, Peter, Nick agrees.

736
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,340
And he's been very successful
with his customers. They love him!

737
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,910
Yes, excellent.
Well, keep up the good work...

738
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,070
...and Ron, you sort out
what you want with this merger.

739
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,230
Now, gentlemen, I really have to...

740
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,070
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Cheers.

741
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,590
I think that went well.
He seemed to go for the merger idea.

742
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,710
- Oh, he did. He really went for it!
- This'll be good for you too, Nick.

743
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,750
They'll give you some kind of
fancy new title! (chuckles)

744
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,830
Uh... Nick!

745
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,310
Nick!

746
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,390
Ron!

747
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,510
Being good...

748
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,980
...is not good enough!

749
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,950
Everyone must be connected to
our strategy, or we will find you...

750
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,110
...and weed you out!

751
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,630
Information arbitrage is our business.

752
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,830
If you don't know what an
information curve is, then find out!

753
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,870
Position yourself in an information curve.

754
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,870
Dominate the curve!

755
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,670
Nick Leeson, who most of you know
and all of you have heard of...

756
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,950
...runs our operation in Singapore...

757
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,710
...which I want all of you to try to emulate.

758
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,830
Now, you'll hear later from Nick
about how he does it...

759
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,270
...but I just want to
drive home to you guys...

760
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,470
...that if you could all think about Nick...

761
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,710
...and perhaps come up with ideas
to follow his footsteps...

762
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,310
...Barings will become...

763
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,790
...one of the most successful operations
in the derivatives business.

764
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,870
(retches)

765
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,830
Oh, fuck!

766
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,310
Oh, we are gonna make so much money!

767
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,590
But more to the point...

768
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,980
...you are gonna make...

769
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,140
...so...

770
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,380
...much...

771
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,620
...money.

772
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,390
Oh, Nick!

773
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,190
Nick... wake up.

774
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,030
- Lisa...
- We're meant to be going to the dinner!

775
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,070
I can't. I can't face it.
I can't take it any more.

776
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,030
I'm not going back after Christmas.
You can't make me.

777
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,230
What?! You're sitting next to
Peter Norris in the seat of honour!

778
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,030
Don't tell me you missed
your presentation too.

779
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,190
- I've been drinkin'.
- I never would have guessed(!)

780
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,390
I think it's downright rude.
You can't let everybody down.

781
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,630
You don't understand, Lisa.

782
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,110
I'm sitting on a fuckin' volcano.
I can't go back!

783
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,390
And what about your bonus?

784
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,940
Now, stop babblin'
and get yourself dressed!

785
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,910
I'll give you volcano, Nick Leeson -
right up your bum!

786
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,350
Lisa... oi!

787
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,390
In you go! You stink!

788
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,350
- Oh, Lisa...
- (cackles)

789
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,030
You bitch!

790
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,070
- I'm gonna kill you now!
- Look at you! What a disgusting sight!

791
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,640
Aagh, no, you're gonna
get me all wet, Nick!

792
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,710
Oh!

793
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,230
(Lisa laughs)

794
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,550
Nick. You've got to get dressed. Stop.

795
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,510
You've got to get dressed! (laughs)

796
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,550
Promise me you'll always love me, Lisa.

797
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,110
That whatever happens,
you'll always love me.

798
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,390
Oh, of course I will!

799
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,470
You're my man, aren't you?

800
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,950
It was crazy going back. I couldn't hope
to survive the end-of-year audit.

801
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,110
There was that little matter
of the 7.78 billion yen...

802
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,870
...which I'd fabricated to plug
the hole in the five eights account.

803
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,670
I should have told Lisa
when I had the chance...

804
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,670
...but this voice kept telling me...

805
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,030
...l'd traded out of losses before -
I could trade out of them again.

806
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,790
What's this letter all about?

807
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,790
Well, it's from SIMEX.

808
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,070
Yes, I know it's from SIMEX.
It came while you were away.

809
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,390
"It appears that you have
financed the trading positions...

810
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,430
...held by sub-account 88888."

811
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,710
"If this is the case
you have violated SIMEX Rule 822...

812
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,070
...which bans members from financing
the trading margins of their customers."

813
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,430
They're just banging on about
our intra-day funding limits.

814
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,590
Well, what is sub-account 88888 anyway?

815
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,030
It's a customer account.
We have umpteen trading accounts.

816
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,190
I'd have to look into it.

817
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,820
We're the number one trader,
and they're tying us up in red tape.

818
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,550
Anyone would think
they didn't want us to trade.

819
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,550
Er... I'll draft an answer for you.

820
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,870
Yeah, do that, will you?
Get it on my desk by the morning.

821
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,340
Of course, Simon.

822
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,430
Lisa?

823
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,390
Lisa?

824
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,470
Lisa, what are you doing?

825
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,710
I'm bleeding, Nick!

826
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,030
(siren)

827
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,150
Why didn't you tell me?

828
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,230
Cos I was waiting till I was sure!

829
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,390
- You're not angry with me, are you?
- Of course I'm not angry, my love.

830
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,630
- You want the baby, don't you?
- I really want the baby.

831
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,180
I want lots and lots of babies. All right?

832
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,990
(whimpers) Yeah.

833
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,110
Your wife is OK...

834
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,190
I'm afraid she's lost the baby.

835
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,590
I'm sorry.

836
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,790
(roar of voices from the floor)

837
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,990
That was the turning point.

838
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,310
That was when I decided
I couldn't stand around any longer...

839
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,110
...hoping the market
would move in my favour.

840
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,990
I was gonna have to make it move.

841
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,340
I didn't care how much money it took.

842
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,510
I was gonna go for broke.

843
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,910
The man is single-handedly generating
a fifth of the group's worldwide profits!

844
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,390
I know. But $30 million in margin
payments? For one day's trading?

845
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,710
You don't seem to understand.
The volumes are enormous!

846
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,150
Nick's guy is the biggest
player on SIMEX!

847
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,670
(phone rings)

848
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,830
- Hello?
- Nick.

849
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,870
It's Brenda.

850
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,270
Listen, buddy. This is putting
a terrible strain on our borrowing.

851
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,190
Tony Hawes is all over me
about your cash calls.

852
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,710
I hear you. But London is
the cash cow for the business here.

853
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,390
We just don't have access
to any other funds.

854
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,990
If you keep hassling me
I've a good mind to stop trading.

855
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,310
No, no, Nick. It's OK. Listen...

856
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,180
Just get back to me with
some meaningful figures, OK?

857
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,030
(whispers) Fuck off.

858
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,350
(phone rings)

859
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,390
Hello?

860
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,070
Thank goodness I caught you.
I know Brenda's giving you a hard time...

861
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,830
I don't think any of you understand
how it works out here.

862
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,590
You may be right, mate.
Anyway, consider it sorted.

863
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,710
But you are gonna have to start
reducing these positions.

864
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,750
Well, Ron, I'll see
what I can do, all right?

865
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,220
While I've got you, about your bonus...

866
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,950
The budget's tight. Though you've been
exceptional there's not much to go round.

867
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,030
I thought we had a record year!

868
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,590
Yeah. That said, I've put in a special plea
to Peter and he's agreed to go up to 350.

869
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,390
350? That's ridiculous!

870
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,150
I'm really pushing out
the boat for you, mate.

871
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,510
I'm busting my balls here.
I made us the top house in SIMEX.

872
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,590
We even got that award
for all the business we're doing!

873
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,980
Yeah, I know that, Nick.

874
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,070
Look, I'll see what I can do.

875
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,910
I'll see if it can't start with a four, eh?

876
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,950
(splashing from bathroom)

877
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,950
That was their opening offer.

878
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,110
He'd have thought something was wrong
if I'd accepted it straight away.

879
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,470
Yeah, it's like winning the lottery.

880
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,550
They must think the world of you.

881
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,350
What's the matter, Lisa?

882
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,150
What do you think's
the bloody matter, Nick?

883
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,230
Everything's changed!

884
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,390
I just wanna go home.
Get the hell out of here and go home.

885
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,550
But... you wanted to come back.
What about the bonus?

886
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,390
Well, can't you get the bonus in London?

887
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,940
Please, Nick! I wanna get on with my life.

888
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,550
I wanna start a family.
I'm going stir-crazy here all on my own!

889
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,790
Calm down. Look, I just need a bit more
time to sort things out, turn things around.

890
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,470
No! You're up at dawn and then you come
back at night and collapse into bed...

891
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,870
How am I meant to get pregnant again
if we never make love?

892
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,870
I know. But this could set us up for life!

893
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,670
- When's bonus day?
- 24th of February. Just five weeks to go.

894
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,320
Right, we're gonna leave on the 25th.

895
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,670
I mean it. I'm calling
the furniture removers tomorrow.

896
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,750
All right.

897
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,590
All right.

898
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,710
With everything else closing in on me,
I'd forgotten about the mooning charge.

899
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,190
When it finally came up,
I was facing a possible jail sentence.

900
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,270
The charge has been reduced
to a misdemeanour.

901
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,510
The maximum penalty is a $200 fine.
I think we should plead guilty.

902
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,550
Thank you very much.

903
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,470
It was uncanny.
I'd got away with it again!

904
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:08,070
To the Singapore legal system,
a shining example to the free world!

905
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,750
We bared our all for Barings.

906
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,710
Bearer bonds takes on
a whole new meaning after this!

907
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,190
(phone rings)

908
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,310
Talk about a bear market!
Hello? Mooners Anonymous.

909
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,310
This is Wei Wei from
Coopers & Lybrand. Is that Nick?

910
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,830
Speaking.

911
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,590
I'm compiling the end-of-year audit. There
seems to be a big hole in the accounts.

912
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,190
I'm missing the 7.78 billion yen...

913
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,270
...receivable from SIMEX.

914
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,630
Nick, can you hear me?

915
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,180
Is everything all right?

916
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,360
It's a little complicated.
What do you need?

917
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,270
I can't find any paperwork.

918
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,350
It was an over-the-counter trade
between Speer, Leads and Kellagg...

919
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,430
...and Barings London.
It fell through the computer system.

920
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,630
I'll have a word with
the systems manager.

921
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,670
I need three bits of paper.

922
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,270
One: Confirmation from SLK
that the 7.78 billion yen will be paid.

923
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,510
Two: Sight of your bank balance
to show it's been received.

924
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,750
And three: A note from Ron Baker saying
he's aware of the deal and approves it.

925
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,830
(line goes dead)

926
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,870
Well?

927
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,750
Oh, it's just a computer glitch.

928
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,400
They're doing their annual audit.

929
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,940
(laughs)

930
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,790
And so, with scissors and paste,
I created $78 million out of thin air.

931
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,460
This was forgery, pure and simple...

932
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,590
...and there was no going back.

933
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,630
- Nick!
- Simon.

934
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,870
Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!

935
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,790
- What's this missing seven billion yen?
- Oh, that's a nightmare.

936
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,440
It's an OTC trade
that was incorrectly booked.

937
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,820
The auditors are really
on my case about it.

938
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,870
It's a pain in the arse,
but we've got to get it sorted.

939
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,230
The point is, we're owed
the money by SLK.

940
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,950
Who the hell are SLK?

941
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,910
Speer, Leads and Kellagg.
It's a brokerage house.

942
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,350
Better send me a memo as soon as.
Get these auditors off my back.

943
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,820
Sure, Simon. Don't worry, I'm onto it.

944
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,950
(phone rings)

945
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,100
Bonnie, it's Nick. Listen.
Listen very carefully.

946
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,790
Transfer 7.78 billion yen from the client
account to the house account tomorrow.

947
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,390
But it won't go!

948
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,270
There isn't enough money.

949
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,750
I know that, but then you can reverse it.
It's just an electronic transaction.

950
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,750
But I want the transfer done.
And I want the bank...

951
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,550
...to send us a fax of the statement,
showing the 7.78 billion yen credit.

952
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,550
All right, Nick. If you say so.

953
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,190
Cheers, Bonnie.

954
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,870
Nick?

955
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,150
What's all this about seven billion yen?

956
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,190
Someone from London, Tony Hawes,
was looking for you.

957
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,820
Jesus Christ, if I hear any more
about this seven billion yen...

958
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,030
It's about $70 million, innit?

959
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,990
What do you reckon? Red or blue?

960
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,870
You think I just walked off
with $70 million?

961
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,350
I didn't say that.

962
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,390
It's a computer error.

963
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,420
You need someone in the back office,
I told you. You're not bloomin' Superman!

964
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,150
Don't start all that again.

965
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,510
It wouldn't have happened
if I'd been there.

966
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,190
Right. I'm goin' out.

967
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,550
- Where are you going?
- To get pissed.

968
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,510
If anyone calls, tell 'em
I've gone to South America.

969
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,160
Well, you can bloody stay there, then!

970
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,230
Twat!

971
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,550
(key in door)

972
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,390
What have you done now, Leeson?

973
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,470
What have you done now?

974
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,790
- (knock on door)
- Come in.

975
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,750
I thought you'd like to know
the audit's been cleared.

976
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,710
- Nick sent the papers. Everyone's happy.
- Thanks, Ron.

977
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,110
Technically we've breached SIMEX rules,
but it was just a non-transaction.

978
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,750
With any luck...

979
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,310
...the auditors won't mention it, or we may
have problems with the local regulator.

980
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,630
Sounds sensible.

981
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:22,710
Do you know, Nick made $10 million
doing arbitrage in a week?

982
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,550
That's about...
half a billion dollars a year.

983
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,710
The guy's a turbo arbitrageur!

984
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,580
If he's doing that amount of business
for that amount of profit...

985
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,300
...why don't we shut down the rest
of the bank? We're just overhead.

986
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,950
Yeah!

987
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,990
(phone rings)

988
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,030
- Hello?
- Nick...

989
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,950
...are you avoiding me?
I've been trying you for days.

990
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,830
Sorry, Tony, it's been chaos.

991
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,300
The audit went through.
I thought you knew.

992
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,390
- It's this SLK thing.
- It's all been cleared up.

993
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,670
I know. What's bothering me is where
you got all the money to actually...

994
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,710
...well, pay SLK in the first place.

995
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,260
I mean, it's the equivalent of $78 million!

996
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,350
It doesn't add up, you know.

997
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:17,420
It's obvious. It's part of the funding we've
had from you over the past few weeks.

998
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,550
Yes.

999
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,030
So, the same figure will flow back to you.

1000
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,350
I see. You're saying that some of
the funding was used to pay SLK?

1001
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,910
That's right, Tony.
So we'll be able to pay it back to you.

1002
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,270
That'll be good. Er...
getting our funding down will be good.

1003
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,590
I'm having to juggle quite a few balls.

1004
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,790
We all are, Tony. Look, I've got to dash.

1005
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,670
I've got company for dinner.

1006
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,550
- Of course. Thanks, Nick.
- (Nick hangs up abruptly)

1007
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,630
Thanks for... clearing that up.

1008
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,790
(phone rings)

1009
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,190
Yes, Ron. What do you want?

1010
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,950
It's me, you wanker! Danny.

1011
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,550
Bubble? What are you doing
calling me in the middle of the night?

1012
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,510
Are you anywhere near a TV?

1013
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,790
I suggest you tune in to CNN.

1014
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,870
The worst damage was in
the seaport of Kobe.

1015
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,260
Road and rail links are shattered...

1016
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,990
Jesus, an earthquake!
That's all we fuckin' need.

1017
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,390
This is gonna kill the market, man.

1018
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,310
The Nikkei's gonna fall
through the fuckin' floor!

1019
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,700
...milling around in search of help.

1020
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,910
Rescue operations are going
to be complicated, long...

1021
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,670
...and expensive. Mike Chinoy,
CNN, reporting live from Tokyo.

1022
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,750
(uproar)

1023
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,070
Market's down 300 points, you stand
there cool as a fuckin' cucumber.

1024
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,230
The way I see it, it's an opportunity.

1025
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,550
I'm gonna buy into the market.
Buy it all the way back up to 19,000.

1026
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,910
Oi!

1027
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,430
Fuckin' true what they say
about your gonads, mate.

1028
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,470
See what I mean?

1029
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,070
Think I'll give Fernando a bell in Tokyo,
see what's shakin'. No pun intended.

1030
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,540
It's Nick. What's the situation in Kobe?

1031
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,710
We've been trying to contact our friends,
but the lines are down.

1032
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,710
Hold it a second. We got movement.

1033
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,030
Holy shit, selling! There's some selling!

1034
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,870
Fuckin' hell, it's in free fall!

1035
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,950
I've never seen it move so fast.

1036
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,990
350! 350!

1037
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,390
350!

1038
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,950
Nick?

1039
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,030
Sure you don't want us to stay?

1040
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,510
No, I... I'm fine. You go.

1041
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,670
You'll make it right, Nick.

1042
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,150
We all believe in you.

1043
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,550
50 million!

1044
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,990
I...

1045
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,380
...Nicholas Leeson...

1046
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,310
...have lost...

1047
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,390
...50 million quid...

1048
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,310
...in one day!

1049
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,270
What does he do, exactly?

1050
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,820
That's what no one seems able to explain.

1051
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,620
It's simple. He switches contracts
between Osaka and SIMEX...

1052
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,990
...exploiting price differentials
between the two markets.

1053
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,910
That's how he offers the best deals
to our customers.

1054
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,750
If it's that easy,
why isn't everybody doing it?

1055
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:27,310
Because he's absolutely in the vortex
of the information curve over there.

1056
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,310
He's discovered a whole
new way of making money.

1057
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,270
Well, he's giving us horrendous
funding problems, that's all I know.

1058
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,510
He doesn't do things by the book, Ron.
He just doesn't respect the rules.

1059
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,300
Is he really the kind of person
we should be employing at Barings?

1060
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:49,340
Oh, fuck the rules. It's barrow boys like
Nick who are turning the City around.

1061
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,830
You can't run a modern financial centre
with a bunch of Hooray Henries.

1062
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,950
Bastard!

1063
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,030
Wakey-wakey!

1064
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,950
- What's the action, mate?
- You tell me.

1065
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,910
The market's up and down
like a tart's knickers.

1066
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,190
- I think the worst is over.
- Who knows? You could be right.

1067
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,230
Well, that's my hunch anyway.

1068
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,910
Listen, I was out last night with that Loy.

1069
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,030
You know, that journo from Reuters.

1070
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,630
He's convinced
there's no mystery customer.

1071
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,340
He reckons it's you. He thinks
you're trading on your own account.

1072
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,390
Without the bank's approval.

1073
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,710
Now, you're not that crazy, are you?

1074
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,670
What do you think?

1075
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,030
Who, then? Beaumarchais?
I thought he'd given you the elbow.

1076
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,270
- I can't tell you.
- Come on. It's me, Danny Boy!

1077
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,670
I could tell you... but I'd
have to shoot you afterwards.

1078
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,430
I know one thing.
If Customer X didn't exist...

1079
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,550
...you'd have to invent him.

1080
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,310
45 million?
You've already had 100 this week.

1081
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,790
Everybody's had an advance margin call
from SIMEX on their client positions.

1082
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,070
They're worried about stability
with these big movements.

1083
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,150
It's an emergency measure(?)

1084
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,270
Isn't everybody squealing out there?

1085
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,350
No, we'll get it back
when the market calms down.

1086
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,390
Nick, when are you gonna
reduce these positions?

1087
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,860
The bean counters are freakin' out!

1088
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,390
Ron! Didn't know you were there.

1089
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,070
For fuck's sake, we've had
the Bank of International Settlements...

1090
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,720
...asking if Barings can
meet its margin payments!

1091
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,500
- It is not good for the image!
- I hear you, Ron. It's a tight market.

1092
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,790
Yeah, well, you've really gotta try.

1093
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,870
Take a hit on it if you have to.

1094
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,230
I know Norris is gonna want to discuss it
with you when he's out there next week.

1095
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,990
Norris?

1096
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,710
- I didn't know he was coming.
- Yeah, with Tony Hawes.

1097
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,110
They want to check the numbers. Iron out
these funding problems once and for all!

1098
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,980
(thunder)

1099
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,670
There was no way I could reduce my
positions without the market collapsing.

1100
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:03,470
By the time they got to Singapore I was in
deeper than ever, faxing Brenda daily...

1101
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,310
...30, 40 million dollars at a time.

1102
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,550
They were gonna kill me.

1103
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,270
Lookin' like shit, Nick.

1104
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,910
Lookin' like fuckin' shit, mate.

1105
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,830
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1106
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,070
(laughter and chat)

1107
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,510
(Hawes) His approach shot
sliced into the woods...

1108
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,910
- Nick. There you are.
- I'm sorry I'm a little bit late.

1109
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,710
- What'll you have?
- A beer would be great, thanks.

1110
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,790
Another Tiger, please.

1111
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,230
Nick...

1112
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,870
- How was the market today?
- It stayed between 18,000 and 18,300.

1113
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,950
It's settled after the earthquake.

1114
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,310
Happy with the positions you're running?

1115
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,790
I'm relaxed. They're March contracts,
so I'll let them expire.

1116
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,590
- Good.
- Thanks.

1117
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,630
Now, we've had a lot of stick...
over funding.

1118
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,990
Brenda Granger tells me we're borrowing
all over Japan to get the funds to you.

1119
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,270
People are beginning to talk, Nick.

1120
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,470
I understand.

1121
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,390
I understand completely.

1122
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,550
Excellent.

1123
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,630
Good man.

1124
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:49,390
And that was it. That was apparently
all he had to say on the subject...

1125
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:54,070
...of my enormous exposure causing
so many ulcers throughout Barings.

1126
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,910
Better than you get in London,
that's for sure!

1127
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,870
You'll enjoy the next course.

1128
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,950
- Lobster, sir?
- No, thanks. I'm not very hungry.

1129
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,670
I should have been able
to relax after that...

1130
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:09,110
...but I couldn't stop thinking about
the losses in the five eights account.

1131
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,710
Shame you can't stay
for the match on Saturday.

1132
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,790
(voices echo)

1133
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,670
(Hawes) You're down for 450, aren't you?

1134
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,750
Your bonus.

1135
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,870
Only a week to go.

1136
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,910
Sorry?

1137
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,510
Have you thought about what you're
going to do with it? Only a week to go!

1138
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,030
Ahem! Excuse me.
I have an announcement to make.

1139
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,630
I know that some of you are worried
about our exposure in the market...

1140
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:51,630
...and you're probably wondering about
the identity of our mystery Customer X.

1141
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,820
Well, the fact is...

1142
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,910
...he doesn't exist.

1143
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,910
We are the customer: Barings.

1144
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,510
Look properly at
the five eights account -

1145
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,870
...which is not a client account,
it's an errors account -

1146
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,510
...and you'll realise it's concealing
losses in the region of ¡ê200 million.

1147
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,150
No, I tell a lie.
It's more like 230 after today!

1148
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,150
What are you going to do
with all that money, Nick?

1149
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,990
Well, I won't spend it
on futures and options!

1150
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,910
- That's very good.
- Very good.

1151
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,830
I was living from day to day,
hoping for a miracle.

1152
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:00,350
I wasn't running a position any more.
The position was running me.

1153
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,070
Man, look at the state you're in.
You got the bloody shakes!

1154
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,790
- You been on the razz all night?
- Nah.

1155
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,030
- I'm just getting killed by the market.
- Tell me about it!

1156
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,110
I've had a shitty week too.

1157
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,630
Penguin? You lucky sod!

1158
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,350
Do you know how rare they are?

1159
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,430
Do you know?

1160
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,670
- It ain't that bloody funny!
- Lucky Leeson(!)

1161
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,510
You have it.
I'm not laughing at you, Bubble.

1162
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,350
Fuck! Sorry.

1163
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,270
'Ey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
You really are in a bad way, ain't ya?

1164
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,910
What's the matter?

1165
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,630
I have an unauthorised position.

1166
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,790
Fuckin' hell.

1167
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,190
How big?

1168
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,270
Big enough to be a problem.

1169
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,470
Poor bastard!

1170
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,390
I can't say it comes as
a complete surprise.

1171
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,710
- Does Lisa know?
- No, she'd kill me.

1172
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,110
She's got enough on her plate. She's just
waiting for my bonus so we can go home!

1173
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,190
So what are you gonna do?

1174
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,230
Well... I just have to keep buying
futures to support the market.

1175
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,470
If it sticks at 18,000, my options are still in
the money - I could get the position back.

1176
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,270
- I may even come out ahead.
- Nick...

1177
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,310
You listen to me now, right.

1178
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,390
You don't fight the market, man.

1179
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,790
Even if you can make the margin calls,
what happens when the contracts expire?

1180
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,500
The way the market's going,
your losses could be catastrophic!

1181
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,390
Five for a thousand,
five for a thousand! Come on!

1182
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,550
George, move this fuckin' market!
If it stays below 18,000 we're dead!

1183
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,950
Come on!

1184
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,980
Nick.

1185
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,820
- Nick!
- Tony.

1186
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,390
Nick, I really need to go over
some of the figures with you.

1187
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,470
Sure, Tony.

1188
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,030
Back in a minute.

1189
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,710
Seven for five! Seven for five!

1190
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,630
I'm sorry. Money!

1191
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,350
I'd thrown away countless more millions,
and it hadn't made a dent.

1192
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,950
I was only one day from bonus day,
but the game was up.

1193
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,510
I was beaten.

1194
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,510
Oh, Nick, you're a bloody fool, aren't you?

1195
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,350
Well, it's not the end of the world.
You've got your health, you've got me...

1196
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,390
Shame about the bonus.

1197
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,470
Sorry.

1198
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,430
Slow down.
The video shop's on the next left.

1199
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,670
- I wanna get our deposit back.
- Right.

1200
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,910
We're gonna need it, darlin'.

1201
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,110
(phone rings)

1202
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,670
- Hello?
- (Baker) The positions have got bigger!

1203
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,110
If they aren't reduced
I'm coming out there to sort you out!

1204
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,310
- You're very faint, Ron.
- And what's this rumour I hear?

1205
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,700
There's a rumour that we're the customer.

1206
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,870
Sorry, you're gonna have to speak up.

1207
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,230
Tell me we're not the customer, Nick.

1208
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,390
- I'm losing you, Ron.
- Nick! Nick, are you there?

1209
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,470
Goodbye, Ron.

1210
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,870
They wouldn't give me the full 200,
but I stood my ground and got 180.

1211
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,950
Good girl.

1212
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,670
Nick!

1213
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,750
(phone rings)

1214
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,390
Excuse me, sir.
There's a phone call for you.

1215
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,470
- Not now.
- It's Peter Norris. He said it's urgent.

1216
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,110
Oh. Thank you.

1217
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,030
Would you excuse me?

1218
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,710
Peter?

1219
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,830
I'm sorry to drag you away
from your dinner party.

1220
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,550
I'm afraid I've got some rather bad news.

1221
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,310
By the time the shit hit the proverbial fan
in London we'd escaped Singapore...

1222
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,350
...to ponder the future
and consider my options.

1223
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,310
If I had any.

1224
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,270
What's gonna happen, Nick?

1225
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,830
They must have got my fax and
closed down all the positions on Friday.

1226
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,030
The market seems to be holding up OK.

1227
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,270
But you're definitely out of a job?

1228
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:26,310
It could have been a lot worse,
but I still lost them a ton of money.

1229
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,580
I'm starving! Think they do burgers here?

1230
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,950
(laughs) No! You're not having a burger.

1231
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,790
- That tummy of yours is driving me nuts.
- Don't stress me, wench!

1232
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,430
(laughs)

1233
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,510
I'll work it off in the gym.

1234
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,310
Better still...

1235
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,270
(kissing)

1236
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,310
- Stop it. People are watching.
- So? I don't care. Come here, girl.

1237
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,990
Jesus Christ, Lisa!

1238
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,190
- Barings has gone bust!
- What?!

1239
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,470
The Chancellor of the Exchequer
is trying to calm fears...

1240
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,340
...sparked by the failure of Barings Bank.
In a statement to Parliament...

1241
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,140
...he denied reports that the British
banking system is about to collapse.

1242
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:23,070
According to him, Barings'
failure is a unique situation...

1243
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,860
...which he blames on the actions
of a rogue trader in Singapore.

1244
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,430
Estimates of potential losses range from
800 million to over one billion pounds.

1245
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,630
There's no way of knowing how markets
will react when they reopen on Monday.

1246
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,110
As the Bank of England tries to
put together a rescue package...

1247
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:44,630
...with the Sultan of Brunei rumoured
as a buyer, time may be running out...

1248
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,230
...for one of Britain's most
venerable financial institutions.

1249
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,590
Charles Samson, CNN, London.

1250
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,670
(whispers) Fuck!

1251
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,510
Oh, Nick!

1252
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,150
How could you not tell me?

1253
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,860
How could you have kept it hidden
for all this time, Nick?

1254
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,150
You must have been through hell!

1255
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,510
You would have marched me
straight into Simon Jones's office.

1256
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,030
- Too bloody right!
- Then I'd have got fired...

1257
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,550
...and I couldn't have made the money
back. That's all I was gonna do.

1258
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,830
No, but you were gambling.

1259
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,350
That's what you were doing.
With other people's money.

1260
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,750
I didn't want to let everyone down.

1261
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,550
You, my dad, the girls in the office...

1262
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,390
Even Ron bloody Baker!

1263
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,550
Do you think they're all
gonna hate me now?

1264
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,550
Well, I don't think you're
gonna be Mr Popular!

1265
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,430
It could easily have been
the other way, you know.

1266
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,470
It so nearly was.

1267
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,030
Then I'd be a hero.

1268
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,950
Oh!

1269
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,110
(whispers) Come here. Come here.

1270
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,110
I still love ya. Mm?

1271
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,670
- (whispers) I love you very much.
- I love you too.

1272
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,070
Shall we see if I can do
something about that belly?

1273
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,150
I see.

1274
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,270
Yes, I understand.

1275
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,470
No, of course.

1276
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,350
Thank you again for your efforts.

1277
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,830
Goodbye.

1278
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,510
That was the Sultan of Brunei's office.
They have decided not to proceed.

1279
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,910
They believe the risks are too great and
the time too short, in view of the need...

1280
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,430
...to have a rescue package ready by the
time markets open again in the Far East.

1281
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,510
Is there really no one else?

1282
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,540
We've tried everyone. It's hopeless.

1283
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:07,750
I therefore have to inform you
that Barings is insolvent...

1284
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,510
...and will go into immediate liquidation.

1285
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,590
(sobs)

1286
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,190
Peter Barings has gone on TV
and said there's been a conspiracy.

1287
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,990
They've lost 800 million quid!

1288
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,540
I lost nowhere near that.
It was more like 300!

1289
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:30,030
But Barings didn't do anything Friday.
Now the word's out, the market's crashed.

1290
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,630
Bloody idiots!

1291
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,710
They think you've run off on your yacht.

1292
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,830
- What?!
- I know. But listen, mate.

1293
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,350
You've got no friends here now,
so just get the fuck out of Asia.

1294
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,190
Get back to London, Australia, anywhere.
Just get out.

1295
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,830
We're tryin'.

1296
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,270
Oi, Nick...
get yourself a good lawyer.

1297
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,350
- Be lucky.
- Cheers, mate.

1298
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,230
(Tannoy) Flight 187 to Hong Kong...

1299
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,310
...leaving from gate two.

1300
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,940
Fuck!

1301
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:09,910
There's a manhunt all over Asia. They
think we're sailing around in our yacht!

1302
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,540
- What bloody yacht?
- I know. What about the flights?

1303
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,750
- There's one to London. Via Singapore.
- That's no good.

1304
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,510
There's a flight to Frankfurt.
Via Abu Dhabi.

1305
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,150
Let's take it.

1306
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,910
And Lisa...

1307
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,990
Pay cash.

1308
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,590
- Newspaper, sir?
- No, thank you.

1309
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,670
- Ma'am?
- Er... no, thanks.

1310
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,150
Nick, take that thing off.

1311
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:26,150
There's a guy over there lookin' at me.

1312
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,700
I'm not surprised, with that bloody hat on!

1313
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,190
Talk about conspicuous! You're
sticking out like a sore bloody thumb.

1314
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,790
Did you say we stop at Abu Dhabi?

1315
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,110
Yeah.

1316
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,230
- That's where they cut your hands off.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous!

1317
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,070
They just stone you.

1318
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,430
What?

1319
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,670
I'm sorry, but you've gotta laugh!

1320
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,630
Poor old Barings, eh? That's what you get
for hiring the wrong sort of person.

1321
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,260
That was when it hit me -

1322
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,350
...the enormity of what I'd done.

1323
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,030
Whatever happened, I knew things
were never gonna be the same again.

1324
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,790
And I've never felt lonelier in all my life.

1325
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,110
I love you, Lisa.

1326
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,190
Whatever happens, I love you.

1327
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,830
I love you too.

1328
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,790
I've got to get back to London.

1329
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:49,830
I couldn't stand being in jail in Singapore.
I couldn't stand it if I couldn't see you.

1330
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,910
Jesus Christ, it's the police!

1331
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,030
They must know I'm on the flight.

1332
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,350
Well... no, not necessarily.

1333
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:07,750
Due to our early arrival, passport control
will take place as you leave the plane.

1334
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,910
Please have your documents ready.

1335
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,510
See?

1336
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,070
I'm scared, Lisa!

1337
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,630
You be strong, OK?

1338
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,190
Danke.

1339
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,990
Pass, bitte.

1340
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,750
Danke. Thank you.

1341
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,630
Please show your passport.

1342
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,670
Where is your man?

1343
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,590
I'm her man.

1344
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,670
(uproar)

1345
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:14,110
250 bid on 100! 250 bid on 100! Come on!

1346
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:18,030
Who wants some of that?
250 bid on 100! 250 bid on 100! Come on!

1347
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,540
Aria from Mozart's "The Magic Flute"

1348
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,350
And that's it, more or less.
That's the end of my story.

1349
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:46,390
Barings was eventually sold to the Dutch
bank ING for the princely sum of ¡ê1.

1350
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,310
Lisa's got a new life as a flight
attendant for Virgin Atlantic.

1351
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,590
I hear she's got herself a new fella.

1352
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:00,100
As for me, I fought unsuccessfully
against extradition...

1353
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:05,190
...from Frankfurt to Singapore on charges
of fraud, forgery and breach of trust.

1354
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,310
I was sentenced to
six and a half years in prison.

1355
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,790
Despite rumours of secret
bank accounts and hidden millions...

1356
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,390
...I did not profit personally
from my unlawful trading.

1357
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,190
To be absolutely honest...

1358
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,270
...sometimes I wish I had.

1359
01:33:56,280 --> 01:34:02,070
I've got something to say

1360
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:12,980
We have come a long way

1361
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:26,030
After all the things
that we have been through

1362
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:33,630
I'm glad still to have you

1363
