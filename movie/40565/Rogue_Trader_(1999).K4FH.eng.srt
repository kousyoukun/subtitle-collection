(newsreader)... denied reports the British
banking system is about to collapse.

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,990
According to him, Barings' failure
is a unique situation...

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,959
...which he blames on the actions
of a rogue trader in Singapore.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,433
Estimates of potential losses range from
800 million to over one billion pounds.

# Leftfield: "Open Up"

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,316
Look at that!

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,391
Will you fuckin' look at that!

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,430
- What, with the black guy?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,714
It's a shame. She looks well spoken for.

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,909
Never know your luck, though. Eh, mate?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,709
- Think I'll give her the treatment!
- No, Steve, no. Don't do that.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,712
- No, you're all right.
- Don't do that. Steve. Steve!

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,554
Hello, love.
I've got something to show ya.

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,717
Are you out of your mind or what?
You fuckin' little prick!

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,756
And I mean little!

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,229
Don't judge a book
by its cover, sweetheart.

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,118
- You're out of your league, arsehole.
- Calm down.

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,952
Fuck off or you're dead!

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,838
- I want you out of here, now.
- He's really sorry.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,038
He's pissed. He meant no disrespect.
That's the last thing on anybody's mind.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,634
Tell him if he doesn't
put that thing away...

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,598
...l'll rip it off and shove it
down his fuckin' throat!

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,229
Do your flies up, you fuckin' animal.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,269
- (cackles)
- Just leave it. It's not worth it!

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,555
He's done it again. I had to pull him off!

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,392
Fuckin' right laugh!

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,071
Aagghh! Aagghh!

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,316
Nick! Nick!

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,391
You all right? Nick!

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,069
It was thanks to Maggie Thatcher
opening up the City of London...

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,632
...that yours truly from Watford came to be
working for a posh outfit like Barings.

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,311
That was me lying on the floor,
if you hadn't guessed. Nick Leeson.

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,391
You've probably heard about me.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,319
Barings was the oldest
private bank in the world.

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,951
They financed the Louisiana Purchase
back in eighteen hundred and something.

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,112
They even had the Queen as a customer!

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,676
I was just a humble clerk.

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,671
But not for long, I hoped.

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,317
Car crash.

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,551
I hit my head on the back
of the seat and broke my nose.

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,792
Everybody else was all right cos they
were wearing their, um... seat belts.

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,871
Poor chap!

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,838
Nick, I know you're keen to get out of the
back office and onto the trading floor...

45
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,912
...but in the meantime
something else has come up.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,514
We've got problems in our Jakarta office.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,672
We need someone to go out there
and sort things out.

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,671
I thought that someone might be...

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,273
...Nick Leeson?

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,032
Indonesia was one of
the new "tiger economies"...

51
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,554
...everyone was getting so excited about.

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,313
"Emerging markets"
they were calling them...

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,676
...and Barings was one of the first
to see their potential.

54
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,313
The rewards were high.
But so were the risks.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,877
One hundred million pounds...

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,632
...in bearer bonds.

57
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,278
As good as cash.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,237
We could pick 'em up, walk out...

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,993
...come to some arrangement
with laughing boy...

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,957
Customers refuse to pay for them.

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,032
They say what's on them
doesn't match the original deal.

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,556
The real reason: the market goes down,
they don't want any more.

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,471
It's a mess.

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,270
You're absolutely 100 per cent right,
Susi. It's one hell of a fuckin' mess.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,355
It was my job to sort out
the certificates...

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,716
...so customers wouldn't have
any more excuses not to pay.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,679
Until then, Barings had this bloody
great hole in their balance sheet.

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,797
It was boring work,
but I knew if I made a success of it...

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,836
...then I could write my own ticket.

70
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,798
All the certificates
are in the right denomination.

71
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,634
I've sorted out all the documentation.
That's all in order now, so...

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,438
...all I need from you...

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,238
...is a cheque!

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,031
Hello. I'm Lisa.

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,996
I'm, um... Nick Leeson. Can I help you?

76
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,594
Barings sent me
to help with the settlements.

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,238
Didn't they tell you?

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,713
Oh, of course! I've been on at them for so
long I never thought they'd get round to it.

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,109
What do we do with that lot?
Build a bonfire?

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,510
I'd never even heard of Barings
before I started working for 'em.

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,909
It's not like there's a Barings in Watford.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,595
You're a hero in London. They think
the sun shines out of your arse.

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,753
Really? I was beginning to feel like
one of those Japanese soldiers.

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,037
Still stuck out in the jungle
20 years after the war!

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,317
What's it like here?
They tell me it's not safe at night.

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,356
Bollocks. The locals are great.

87
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,514
And it's not full of pompous ex-colonials
thinking they were born to rule the world.

88
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,431
That's what I love about Asia.

89
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,550
Anyone can make it.
Doesn't matter which school you went to.

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,235
When they told me I was going to
Jakarta I had to look it up on the map.

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,511
As a matter of fact, so did I.

92
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,632
I really want to be a trader.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,678
If Barings don't let me
on the floor after this, I'm off.

94
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,594
- Not gonna be bloody clerking all my life.
- Ooh! Ambitious, aren't we?

95
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,591
- Is that bad?
- It's great.

96
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,511
I just want to get on in life.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,559
I like to enjoy myself, don't get me wrong.
Work hard, play hard.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,991
Well, I think this is me.

99
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,199
Well, night, Nick. That was fun.

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,549
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
- (door bleeps)

101
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,313
- OK. Night-night!
- See you tomorrow, then.

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,316
Lisa was a stunner all right.

103
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,356
Love at first sight.

104
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,750
Together we made short work
of the rest of those bonds.

105
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,118
Soon we cleared up most of Barings'
losses and it was time to go home.

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,918
See you later, Lisa.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,036
Bye.

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,591
(laughs)

109
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,117
I think you'll agree that in Nick
Lisa has met her prince.

110
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,792
(guests) Hear! Hear!

111
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,316
Join me in wishing them well
in their new life in Singapore...

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,076
...where Nick is to be general manager of
the trading floor. Whatever that means.

113
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,072
- It impressed the hell out of me, but...
- (laughter)

114
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,434
And, um...

115
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,830
To you, Nick, I'm entrusting
the most precious of gifts.

116
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,753
I know you're gonna look after her
and cherish her...

117
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,400
...and all those other things.
And if you don't...

118
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,550
...l'll break your bloody legs, all right?

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,953
(woman) He means it!

120
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,596
I love you so much, Lisa Leeson.

121
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,875
I love you too, Nick.

122
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,951
(cheering)

123
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,837
As a reward for Jakarta I'd been given the
far more important market of Singapore...

124
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,435
...with a brief to set
up my own trading operation.

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,316
I was definitely on my way.

# DJ Rap: "Good To Be Alive"

127
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,717
- And the kitchen...
- This is your department, darling.

128
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,791
Since when? Cheeky!

129
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,271
And the bedroom...

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,953
- If you need anything, call me.
- Right, thanks.

131
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,996
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks. Bye.

132
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,071
- Goodbye.
- (door shuts)

133
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,920
Not bad for a chancer from Watford, eh?

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,356
Well, um... I think we should
test out that mattress, big boy.

135
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,431
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

136
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,071
(Lisa) Whoo!

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,278
I can't see any problem in you
handling both sides of the operation.

138
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
- At least until volumes increase.
- Right.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,798
You shouldn't need more than two
on the trading floor.

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,791
A couple more in the back office.

141
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,711
No need to pay top dollar.

142
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,553
Get them young, get them hungry
and train them up.

143
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,191
- I'm a bottom line kind of guy, Nick.
- Absolutely. That's my philosophy.

144
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,718
I took him at his word.
My team were young, hungry...

145
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,518
...and they didn't have a clue.

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,390
A futures contract allows you to buy or
sell a specified amount of a commodity...

147
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,869
...at a specified price at a future date.

148
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,191
Right. Um...

149
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,796
It's like, if I agree to sell you this cup
of cappuccino, which I don't yet own...

150
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,916
...at 45 cents a month from now...

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,198
If I can buy the cappuccino at,
say, 43 cents, I make a profit.

152
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,590
If the price goes the other way
I have to pay more, and I lose.

153
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,558
It's timing - buying and selling
at the right moment.

154
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,871
Sometimes espresso might be
the best deal, or salt, or pepper.

155
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,030
So, we're running a supermarket?

156
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,595
We're not buying and selling
anything real.

157
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,195
It's just numbers - contracts
based on the value of the Nikkei...

158
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,998
...the Tokyo stock market.

159
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,436
- Er, we do this for the bank?
- No, no, for the customers.

160
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,478
We are not allowed to trade
on behalf of the bank.

161
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,994
Be sure you remember that, all right?

162
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,719
Other dealers wear red jackets. All same.
Red is lucky Chinese colour.

163
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,679
Well, we want to stand out. We're a
new operation. We need to be noticed.

164
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,716
May be bad luck. Different colour.

165
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,711
Bollocks. We make our own luck.

166
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,076
Nick's right.
We're cool dudes, man. Whoo!

167
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,471
(Nick chuckles)

168
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,592
# Barrett Strong:
"Money (That's What I Want)"

169
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,152
(roar of voices)

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,560
Fernando. Anything happening in Tokyo?

171
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,392
Nothin'. How's SIMEX?

172
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,551
Same here. No one's playin'.

173
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,631
590, and trading small.

174
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,517
600, and thin too.

175
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,955
580 here. There's a seller who wants
to trade in size. Shall I low-tick him?

176
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,632
Yeah. Flush him out.

177
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,078
- Squeeze the sucker.
- How many?

178
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,479
200.

179
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,232
Buy them... now.

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,672
- Buy 'em!
- Filled!

181
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,597
We paid 580 for 200.

182
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,069
Way to go, Nick! I sold at 590.

183
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,268
Fuck a duck! Just made 2,000 quid.

184
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,998
Yes!

185
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,071
# "Money" continues

186
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,712
They were a good bunch
and they were keen to learn.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,073
It looked like a madhouse with
all the traders waving and shouting...

188
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,038
...but it all made sense
once you got the hang of it.

189
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,192
There were hiccups,
but that's normal in any operation...

190
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,953
...especially a new one like ours.

191
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,790
The important thing was
we were picking up the business...

192
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,871
...and the future looked rosy.

193
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,996
Nick, what's the difference between
initial margin and variation margin?

194
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,039
Initial margin's a down payment
on each futures contract that we trade.

195
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,395
We don't pay in full
until a contract matures.

196
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,155
But in the meantime the value of
each contract may go up or down.

197
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,391
So SIMEX calculate our positions
on a daily basis.

198
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,712
They'll ask for more money if the market
goes against us. That's variation margin.

199
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,189
Got it. I think!

200
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,955
We need to open an errors account.
We've had a few mistakes.

201
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,157
I need somewhere to put them
till I can write them out.

202
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,834
Sure. What number shall I give it?

203
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,754
- Well, what's your lucky number?
- Eight. It is a very lucky Chinese number.

204
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,274
And how many numbers do we need?

205
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,509
Five.

206
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,718
Then let's give it all the luck it can handle.
Call it the 88888 account.

207
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,316
And now it gives me great pleasure to
welcome the chairman of Barings Bank...

208
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,631
...Peter Baring.

209
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,799
We may be the oldest
merchant bank in the world...

210
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,839
...but that's no excuse for
not keeping up with the times.

211
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,876
When I became chairman...

212
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,351
...I realised we couldn't go on running
Barings like a gentlemen's club.

213
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,718
We had to look beyond
our traditional recruiting grounds...

214
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,870
...the old school tie...

215
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,032
...to seek out a new and hungrier breed.

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,437
We're beginning to see the fruits
of those efforts, and I have to say...

217
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,311
...the recovery in profitability, since
the reorganisation, has been... amazing.

218
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,030
To be frank, I've discovered
it's not actually terribly difficult...

219
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,839
...to make money
in the securities business!

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,228
Filled.

221
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,271
Yeah, you paid 50 for 20.

222
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,274
- (knock on door)
- Come in.

223
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,195
Simon, er... I've got a slight problem.

224
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,717
One of the girls sold 20 contracts
for Fuji Bank instead of buying.

225
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,950
I can't do anything about it till Monday.

226
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,519
What's the damage?

227
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,871
20,000 at the close.

228
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,553
Sack the cow.
She'll never work on SIMEX again.

229
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,111
That's a bit hard, isn't it?

230
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,236
Look, you handle it.

231
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,472
Have a word with London,
but make sure you make that client good.

232
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,350
All right.

233
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,076
Hey! Have a beer, shithead!

234
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,593
Cheers.

235
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,591
Hi, darling.

236
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,875
Anyone seen Kim?

237
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,235
She was here a minute ago.

238
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,551
Kim...

239
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,436
Nick, Nick...

240
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,511
I'm really sorry. I got so confused.

241
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,592
- Everybody was shouting all at once.
- That's the job.

242
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,638
That's what it's all about,
keeping a cool head.

243
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,029
I'm so sorry! I'll pay you back the money.

244
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,830
Sure, Kim. Four years' salary? And if
the market moves it could be even worse.

245
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,358
Come on, come on.

246
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,396
Come on, everyone makes mistakes.

247
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,719
Look, with a bit of luck I can
trade out of it on Monday, all right?

248
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,872
Nick, I've been waiting for you while
everyone else is having a good time.

249
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,951
- I'm going home now.
- Kim!

250
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,590
Kim...!

251
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,154
- Everything all right?
- Never better.

252
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,077
Why don't you let me come in and help?
I can't sit around all day doing nothing.

253
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,151
It's not a problem, Lisa.

254
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,751
I can handle it.

255
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,194
Fernando, how are
March futures looking?

256
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,319
- I need 20 contracts at Friday's price.
- You won't get Friday's price!

257
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,437
I should have closed off the position
and taken the loss.

258
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,750
Instead, I waited for the market to
change.

259
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,274
It changed all right,
but not the way I wanted.

260
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,512
Now I was stuck with a bigger loss than
I could own up to. And it was all my fault.

261
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,592
Nick! I hear your girl handed in her notice.

262
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,148
Never came back.
She couldn't stand the pace.

263
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,878
So much for loyalty!

264
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,919
- Did you make the client good?
- Of course. Made a small profit, actually.

265
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,991
Good man.

266
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,873
(softly) This one's for
the five eights account.

267
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,996
I bought the missing contracts.

268
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,433
60,000?

269
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,636
- Shh!
- It was only 20 before.

270
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,632
And the market went the wrong way.
I had to cut the loss.

271
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,676
What did Simon Jones say?

272
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,716
Are you serious?
He'd shut us down if he knew.

273
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,509
It'll be all right so long as we balance
the books by the end of the month.

274
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,636
- How?
- We trade on our own account...

275
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,793
...until we wipe out the losses, then
we use money from the client account...

276
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,269
...and pay it back with
next month's profits.

277
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,918
You mean, gamble?

278
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,832
(whispers) Relax, Bonnie.
That's all the market is.

279
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,115
One giant casino!

280
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,798
George!

281
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,752
I was counting on nobody looking at
the books until the end of each month.

282
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,833
As long as the five eights account had a
nil balance on the last day of the month...

283
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,718
...no one would suspect
that anything was wrong.

284
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,031
But instead of winning back
the position we made more losses...

285
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,999
...and I had to borrow more money
from the client account to hide them.

286
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,592
Fuckin' hell, George,
what are you playing at? Get fuckin' out!

287
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,671
Get fuckin' out! Now!

288
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,551
What the hell are you playing at?
Out! Get out!

289
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,591
Fuckin' hell!

290
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,192
- Agh.
- God, you're tense. Stiff as a board.

291
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,637
If you only knew! All cos those bastards
won't let me hire proper staff.

292
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,315
- I thought it was going so well.
- It is. It's going brilliant.

293
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,836
I just spend most of my life
covering everybody else's arse.

294
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,832
Well, why don't you let me
help with the back office?

295
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,309
- I'm bored being a lady of leisure.
- No.

296
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,632
Why not? It's ridiculous, you having
to handle trading and settlements.

297
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,631
You'll have a nervous breakdown.

298
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,109
I don't want you interfering.
I can handle it.

299
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,875
All right, keep your pants on!
No one's saying you can't.

300
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,872
I'm not going back to being
a bloody clerk. I'd rather be a plasterer.

301
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,717
My mum always used to say
I could be anything I wanted...

302
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,553
...so long as I took my chances -
and worked like a dog.

303
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,916
Well, you have.
You've worked really hard and it paid off.

304
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,797
She'd have been so proud of you.

305
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,110
Do you really think so?

306
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,318
Yeah.

307
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,197
I know I am!

308
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,872
That was the worst part -
Lisa thinking I was this brilliant success.

309
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,917
If she only knew
what a fuck-up I really was!

310
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,434
When I wanted the market
to go up, it went down.

311
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,590
If I wanted it to go down, it went up.

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,434
It was hard not to take it personally.

313
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,359
Nick?

314
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,796
Nick! I just worked out the balance
in the eights account.

315
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,634
- The losses are over $10 million!
- Keep your fuckin' voice down!

316
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,711
Look, there's no need to panic.

317
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,271
There's not enough in the client account
to make margin payments, Nick.

318
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,072
(softly) Right.

319
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,158
I need dollars. I need dollars
to cover the initial margin payment!

320
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,510
I can get dollars from London to cover all
the client positions for the futures I buy!

321
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,309
Nothing unusual about that.
But I'm gonna need yen.

322
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,437
Gonna need yen to cover
the daily variation columns!

323
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,717
Which'll leave a yen deficit
by the end of the month.

324
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,073
Unless... unless I sell options.

325
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,869
That'll generate commission in yen.

326
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,559
And return the balance sheet
on the five eights account to zero!

327
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,752
As long as London kept sending out
money to finance the client positions...

328
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,310
...l'd have enough cash to stay
on top of the margin payments.

329
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,514
It was like robbing Peter to pay Paul...

330
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,319
...but hopefully I'd end up making enough
to pay Peter back before he found out.

331
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,030
Meanwhile I had to generate more and
more business to justify my cash calls...

332
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,270
...and for that I needed customers.

333
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,551
The bigger the better.

334
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,111
Mm-hm. Oui.

335
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,996
Bon, tres bien.

336
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,798
Mr Leeson.

337
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,314
- I'm Pierre Beaumarchais.
- Nice to meet you.

338
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,631
I work for the Geneva Banking Trust,
based in the Bahamas.

339
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,710
I was speaking with Ang Swee Tian,
president of SIMEX.

340
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,315
He's impressed by the amount of
business you've been generating.

341
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,994
- There's a lot of opportunities here.
- Oh, yes.

342
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,031
I do a lot of business on SIMEX.

343
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,795
With the exception of George Soros...

344
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,792
...I probably trade in the Nikkei
more than anyone.

345
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,952
Sometimes over 5,000 contracts in a day.

346
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,476
That is a lot.
The whole market only does about 20.

347
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,832
Could Barings handle
that amount of business?

348
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,236
You bet we could!

349
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,880
Beaumarchais was
the answer to my prayers.

350
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,520
I'd be able to siphon off
enough commission...

351
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,910
...to square the eights account
once and for all.

352
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,315
- Hello?
- Pierre Beaumarchais.

353
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,914
I want to buy 4,000 June contracts.

354
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,158
I've... got a price of 350,
but this'll move it.

355
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,754
Try not to pay more than 400.

356
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,673
We gotta get them cheap.
Beaumarchais is a big player.

357
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,354
If we pull this off,
we get a shitload of business.

358
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,000
- What's liquidity like?
- Tight as a flea's arse.

359
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,753
We'll get away with 500,
then the price will move up.

360
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,116
OK. But then we'll make the other
traders think we're sellers.

361
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,509
And when the price drops... buy! All right?

362
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,192
OK.

363
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,156
Sell 250!

364
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,958
Sell 250! Sell 250!

365
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,792
Sell 240!

366
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,394
Sell 240! Sell 240!

367
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,955
Sell 200! Sell 200!

368
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,309
- Buy 500 contracts!
- Sell 200!

369
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,118
Buy? Buy?

370
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,158
Buy at 200! Buy at 200! Buy at 210!

371
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,231
Buy at 210! Buy at 220!

372
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,635
Buy at 220! Buy at 230!

373
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,238
Buy at 240!

374
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,311
Buy at 240! Buy at 240!

375
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,598
Filled!

376
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,197
Nobody saw us coming! We swooped
on the first 1500 like a Stealth bomber!

377
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,111
4,000 contracts!

378
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,192
Balls of steel, Fat Boy.
Balls of fuckin' steel!

379
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,150
# Andy Williams:
"Can't Take My Eyes Off You"

380
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,918
At last my luck had changed.
Suddenly I couldn't stop making money.

381
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,792
I was long in the Nikkei - that meant
gambling on it going up - and up it went.

382
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,871
Up and up and up.

383
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,834
That's very good! Very good.

384
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,111
Serves you right, Lisa!

385
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,154
If it went all the way up to 19,000, I stood
to make a killing on the options I'd sold.

386
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,996
Come on, come on!
Come on, baby, you can do it. Come on.

387
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,631
- Yes!
- Yes!

388
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,030
Bonnie, we're on a fuckin' roll!

389
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,111
Yes!

390
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,996
Do you think we'll do it?

391
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,071
(bell rings)

392
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,113
It's amazing!
You've made back all the losses.

393
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,432
- Over $10 million.
- What did I tell you? Oh, ye of little faith!

394
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,239
You keep doubling up,
and sooner or later...

395
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,356
...you're bound to win.

396
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,318
# "Jingle Bells"

397
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,358
The Nikkei has closed up
for the third day in a row...

398
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,876
...and the rally shows little sign
of running out of steam.

399
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,430
Analysts are predicting
additional gains in the days ahead.

400
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,511
(bulletin continues)

401
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,596
- Happy?
- Yeah. Are you?

402
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,511
Never better.

403
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,359
I have been sailing a bit close to the wind.
I didn't want to worry you with it.

404
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,150
- What do you mean?
- No, it's all right.

405
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,755
The market turned round and a whole
load of my positions came good.

406
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,717
I made it all back.

407
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,791
What are you on about, Nick?

408
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,358
Don't get your knickers in a twist, but we
made mistakes and ran up some losses.

409
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,829
I went out on a limb
to get back the position.

410
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,751
How big were the losses?

411
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,354
- It's about a million.
- A million quid?!

412
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,111
For God's sake, Nick!

413
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,471
No, it's all right. It paid off.
I squared it up.

414
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,991
I had to do it to protect the guys.

415
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,754
Promise me that you'll
never do that again.

416
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,400
- It's not worth it, Nick.
- I promise.

417
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,191
You will give me a heart attack.

418
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,992
(they laugh)

419
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,753
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

420
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,751
(cheering)

421
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,551
Fuck off!

422
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,316
I really meant it. I was the number one
trader, and as the new year came in...

423
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,756
...I was determined to kick
my addiction to the eights account.

424
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,717
What will the market do? Long-term?

425
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,473
No one thinks long-term,
they think nanoseconds!

426
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,233
- Long-term's tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow, then.

427
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,074
- That would be telling.
- Leeson speaks, the market moves!

428
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,151
You said it, mate.

429
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,395
Pierre.

430
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,792
I want to sell the 220 call options
and buy the 200 calls in December.

431
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,917
I've got an offer of.138 for size.

432
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,877
Can you do better?

433
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,598
I'll get back to you.

434
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,274
Quick as you can, Nick.
I have to move fast.

435
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,991
Oui, oui, je suis toujours la.

436
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,959
What the hell is he on about,
.138 for size?

437
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,316
The market in 220 calls is down.
He wants to cut his losses.

438
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,073
- Yeah, but why.138?
- It's a ratio.

439
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,435
The 200 calls are trading at 1,400.

440
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,399
Divide 200 by 1,400, you get.143.

441
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,869
All right. But not.138.

442
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,313
Unless someone's offered him a discount.
Probably Societe Generale.

443
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,153
We can't let those wankers
get our biggest client.

444
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,708
- What are you gonna do?
- Just have to leg it.

445
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,349
Buy the contracts from Pierre
and sell them when the market rises?

446
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,432
I thought we were not supposed
to trade for the bank.

447
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,476
Pierre? I can do it. What's the exact size?

448
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,279
6,500? All right, leave it with me.
No problem.

449
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,117
What if the market doesn't rise, uh?
What if it falls?

450
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,590
I've gambled and won before.
I can gamble and win again.

451
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,309
Balls of steel, me old mateys,
and you'd better believe it.

452
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,192
Bonnie, I need you to
reopen the eights account.

453
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,156
We got caned on
Beaumarchais' contracts.

454
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,516
Now the bastard's gone back
to Societe Generale.

455
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,878
Fax Brenda Granger in London. Ask her
for funds to cover the margin payments.

456
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,951
Tell her it's for client positions.

457
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,917
- (internal phone)
- Hello?

458
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,116
It's Simon.
Can you come into my office?

459
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,679
Right away.

460
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,912
Christ, I'd been rumbled!
The only surprise was it'd taken so long.

461
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,072
What was I gonna tell Lisa?
She'd bloody murder me.

462
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,151
- (knock on door)
- Come in.

463
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,752
Congratulations, Nick.

464
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,230
The '93 bonuses are in,
and you're down for 135 grand.

465
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,790
135? That's fantastic!

466
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,591
Your little operation generated profits of
over 10 million last year. You're a star!

467
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,788
In fact, your figures are so high
they're going to check up on you.

468
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,757
Check up on me?

469
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,798
They're sending Ash Lewis out
for the audit.

470
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,958
Don't worry. It's purely routine.

471
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,996
Ash Lewis?

472
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,833
She's meant to be
a right ball-breaker, isn't she?

473
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,431
That's our booth.

474
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,197
Filled! You paid 250.

475
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,111
Hi, Nick.

476
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,191
Ron Baker and Ash Lewis.

477
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,669
Ron is head of Derivatives Trading
in London.

478
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,796
Which I guess makes me your boss, Nick.

479
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,713
- How do you, Mr Leeson?
- Very well, thank you.

480
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,870
OK. Let's see the action!

481
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,109
Henry!

482
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,590
(Baker) Who's doing all the business?
We're the biggest, right?

483
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,592
We do a lot of arbitrage,
so we do have a high volume.

484
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,672
We signal orders in to George
in the pit - this is Henry -

485
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,629
...and at the end of the day the girls in the
office log all the deals on to the computer.

486
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,111
(Lewis) You manage the trading floor
and the settlements office, is that right?

487
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,031
Yes, yes.

488
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,113
That's a little unusual. Whatever
happened to checks and balances?

489
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,113
- That's something we need to talk about.
- I'll be here for three weeks.

490
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,079
This is going to be a thoroughly
comprehensive audit. No stone unturned.

491
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,711
Absolutely. Anything I can do to help,
any stone needs turning, let me know.

492
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,677
Are we filled? Good man, Henry.

493
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,557
Nice to see you, Simon.

494
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,555
Dad's seen this flat in Blackheath.

495
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,916
Needs a bit of work, but him
and my granddad can fix it up.

496
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,310
Think of it like an insurance policy
in case you get sacked...

497
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,188
...have to go back to England
and work as a plasterer! (laughs)

498
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,030
What's up with you, misery-guts?

499
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,353
What would you do, Lise?
What would you do if I did get the elbow?

500
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,318
You've just been given
a ruddy great big bonus.

501
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,359
But what if it all went wrong? What if
I'm not as clever as everyone thinks?

502
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,271
Oh, of course you are!

503
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,151
Anyway, it's you I love.
I don't give a toss about the money.

504
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,950
If it was up to me we'd jack it all in now,
go back to England and start a family.

505
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,070
You're doing brilliantly, Nick.

506
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,997
You're a bloody star.

507
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,791
- Nick!
- (softly) Fuck!

508
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,313
Simon!

509
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,313
- You're looking disgustingly chirpy.
- Haven't you heard? Panic over.

510
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,551
- Ash has been called back to London.
- You're kidding. Why?

511
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,679
Office politics. Some turf battle
between Futures and Securities.

512
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,276
- And what about the audit?
- They'll send Mark Taylor and Chris Carr.

513
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,158
Compared to Ash
they're a couple of pussies.

514
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,553
Pity. I was rather looking forward to
seeing the dreaded Ash Lewis in action!

515
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,071
(whispers) Yes!

516
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,076
No, I'm just leaving now.

517
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,835
I'm gonna jump in the shower.
If you get home first, put the oven on.

518
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,629
- All right, sweetheart. I'll see you then.
- Bye, darling.

519
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,071
(cackles)

520
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,314
- Get in, you bastard!
- What the fuck is that?

521
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,188
Sex on wheels.
It's a Porsche, moron! Get in!

522
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,436
I'll tell you what it is.

523
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,511
It's disgustin'.

524
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,037
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a great big hard-on!

525
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,239
Got to think of something
to do with my bonus.

526
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,914
You keep your eyes on the road,
you flash git!

527
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,034
# Jerry Lee Lewis: "Great Balls Of Fire"

528
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,636
Whoo!

529
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,518
- It's a fuckin' one-way street, George.
- Whoops!

530
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,948
Goodness, gracious, great balls of steel!

531
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,676
- Whoo!
- Fuckin' George!

532
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,710
Shit! There's that Reuters journalist.

533
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,711
Nick! Nick!

534
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,792
He's been bugging me
for weeks for an interview.

535
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,911
- Hey, Nick!
- All right, mate?

536
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,238
Nick, my man. What'll you have?

537
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,835
Oh, a beer, please. You know
George Seow, one of my dealers?

538
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,275
This is Danny
from Intercontinental Trading.

539
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,512
- Just been sent from the London office.
- Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

540
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,229
I hear Barings have almost cornered
the market here, thanks to you.

541
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,754
The rumours have been
greatly exaggerated.

542
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,671
Don't be so modest.

543
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,709
He's king of the exchange! Barings got an
award for all the business he's generated.

544
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,950
- Do you want a beer?
- I'd love a beer.

545
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,193
Aagghh!

546
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,071
(canned laughter)

547
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,151
(shouting, laughter)

548
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,671
(music, drunken shouting)

549
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,235
(Nick) Watch the Drambuie settle.

550
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,756
And it's called depth charge.

551
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,752
It's guaranteed to blow
your fuckin' head off.

552
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,116
Are you ready?

553
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,350
Let's do it. Let's have it.

554
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,759
One!

555
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,637
And two!

556
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,472
And three!

557
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,551
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

558
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,473
Hey! Pretty women!
What are you waiting for?

559
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,152
Come on!

560
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,831
- Come on!
- Tough shit, George.

561
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,309
Your charm's just not working tonight.

562
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,470
Stuck-up bitches!

563
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,839
- I bet they're Singapore air hostesses.
- Flight lieutenants, if you don't mind!

564
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,911
Chocks away!

565
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,711
Flight lieutenants...!

566
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,275
Help 'em to decide if they wanna come in
or if they don't wanna come in.

567
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,430
Let's give 'em a hand and moon 'em!

568
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,352
That should help 'em decide.
Come on, don't be shy!

569
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,590
Your mother wasn't!

570
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,557
I love this man.

571
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,392
- On three?
- It worked before.

572
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,232
It could work again. One...

573
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,557
Two! Three!

574
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,834
Bottoms up!

575
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,592
That is disgusting!

576
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,636
Whoo!

577
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,995
(Danny) What'll it be, you old bastard?

578
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,833
Absolutely brilliant, Nick!
Drinks are on me.

579
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,593
Enough depth charges
to sink a battleship!

580
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,950
- Fuck, what time is it?
- I don't know.

581
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,474
Got to phone Lisa.

582
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,356
Oh, you've got to be jokin'!

583
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,476
No laughing matter.

584
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,872
Outraging a lady's modesty...
very serious crime in Singapore.

585
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,875
News of my disgrace reached London.
At the highest level.

586
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,279
It's slightly embarrassing,
but one of our traders got drunk...

587
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,078
...and pulled a moon.

588
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,037
What did you say?

589
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,792
He exposed his bottom.

590
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,438
(laughter)

591
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,114
- Why?
- Playing silly buggers, I expect.

592
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,749
Unfortunately, the law over there
takes rather a dim view.

593
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,751
Maybe we should sack him.

594
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,913
Sacking him would be...
awkward, to say the least.

595
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,198
He generates a significant amount
of our profits in Southeast Asia.

596
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,319
I, er... ought to mention we're getting
stick from the Bank of England...

597
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,277
...about our funding over there.

598
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,717
Technically we're in breach of regulations
on the ratio of lending to capital.

599
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,315
Would you like me to have
a quiet word in their ear?

600
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,356
Oh, we're not quite there yet.

601
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,115
When I spoke to Andy Dixon
at the Bank, he said the matter was...

602
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,272
..."buried reasonably deep in his in-tray".

603
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,112
Just flagging a concern.

604
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,112
Quite right. It's something
we should keep an eye on.

605
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,236
Well... is that it? Any other business?

606
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,871
Well, what about this chap Leeson?
He of the exhibitionist tendencies.

607
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,673
I suppose it's something we should
leave to the Singapore authorities.

608
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,070
I have to say... I'm inclined to agree.

609
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,279
So, it was the profits that saved me.

610
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,271
If they only knew!

611
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,915
Nick!

612
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,798
That guy from Reuters again.
The second time today.

613
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,871
Tell him I've...

614
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,951
Oh, fuck it! Gimme the phone.

615
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,869
Print me up a balance
on the eights account.

616
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,154
Hi, Loy.

617
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,754
Nick! You're a hard man to pin down.

618
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,115
You know how it is.
What can I do you for?

619
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,397
- Quite a position you've been buying.
- We're happy.

620
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,789
I don't know how the client
wants to play it.

621
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,668
Who is this mystery client, Nick?
He must have rather large balls.

622
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,275
I'm sorry, mate.
Client confidentiality and all that.

623
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,351
Is it Pierre Beaumarchais?

624
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,789
Sorry, Loy, I... gotta go.
I'll speak to you later.

625
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,871
Speak to you some other time.

626
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,029
Jesus Christ, Bonnie. It's 7.78 billion yen!

627
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,159
- Do you want the dollar amount? It's...
- Yeah, yeah, $77.8 million.

628
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,515
Book me the following notional trade.

629
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,913
Selling 1,000 December 21,500
put options at a price of... 7778.

630
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,834
Then print me a new report after that
entry so it shows 7.78 billion yen...

631
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,037
...as if it was owing to us from SIMEX.
- Sure, Nick.

632
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,717
Then fax Brenda Granger in London,
asking for more funds.

633
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,997
Say we've had a large margin call
on our client positions.

634
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,399
How much?

635
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,436
A million.

636
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,033
Make it two.

637
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,031
(phone rings)

638
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,391
- Nick!
- Mm?

639
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,631
Nick, it's the phone.

640
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,597
- Hello?
- (Baker) I'm not disturbing you, am I?

641
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,159
It's 2am.

642
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,310
Oh, Christ. Sorry, mate. Had no idea.

643
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,712
The old farts are getting nervous. They
want you to unwind the position a little.

644
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,078
That's easier said than done. Don't want
to send the wrong signal to the market.

645
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,115
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,478
Second, we need another 2 million profit
by next month to secure our bonuses.

647
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,155
Two million? Ron, what planet
do you live on, mate?

648
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,879
One minute you want me
to unwind the positions...

649
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,916
Failure is not an option, mate.

650
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,037
See you at the junket in London
in three weeks' time.

651
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,315
2 million?

652
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,472
Who do they think I am, George Soros?

653
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,792
We were close to the end of another year
and I was deeper in the shit than ever.

654
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,873
Barings wanted me to speak at their
annual group conference in London.

655
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,078
I was their star trader, and they wanted
to know the secrets of my success.

656
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,151
It didn't bear thinking about.

657
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,435
(TV on low)

658
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,273
- Is Nan staying with Auntie Karen?
- Yeah.

659
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,158
- It's the best place she could be.
- Aww, poor thing.

660
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,753
(phone rings)

661
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,035
- Has she been crying?
- Mm.

662
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,792
Has she?

663
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,192
Hello?

664
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,030
Nick! It's for you.

665
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,111
Ron Baker.

666
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,076
Ron! Can't believe you
tracked me down already.

667
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,312
Listen, with this conference you'll be
away from the trading floor a long time.

668
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,233
I had to come back a week early
for this funeral.

669
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,279
- I told you, Lisa's granddad passed away.
- I'm sorry about that, mate...

670
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,114
...but I'm fighting for your bonus.
You need to keep up those profits.

671
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,317
- I couldn't miss this funeral.
- No one's asking you to!

672
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,552
I'll issue you a pass so you can come in
on Sunday and trade through the night.

673
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,596
You won't miss a thing!

674
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,830
Get out the fuckin' way!

675
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,950
If he's working this hard
he's going to need his food.

676
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,316
He wants me to go into the office
on Sunday night and trade.

677
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,072
Well... no!

678
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,755
That's completely out of order.
Let someone else make the profits!

679
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,070
She's right, Nick. You're not a machine.

680
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,709
It's bonus time. If I don't deliver,
then everybody loses out.

681
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,237
It's not fair, Nick. You carry on at this rate,
you're gonna be in a right old state.

682
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,958
It's gonna be your funeral next.

683
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,112
For as much as it hath
pleased almighty God...

684
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,760
...of his great mercy to take unto himself...

685
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,559
...the soul of our dear brother
here departed...

686
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,598
...we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

687
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,718
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

688
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,511
...dust to dust.

689
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,956
Good to see you, son.
Sorry occasion, but there you go.

690
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,952
- He had a good innings.
- That's the main thing.

691
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,671
So how's it going over there?

692
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,990
- Can't complain.
- We're all proud of you.

693
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,310
- What you've achieved.
- It's no big deal.

694
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,231
Don't be so bloody modest!

695
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,515
You a plasterer's son!

696
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,637
I just wish your mum
could have been here to see it.

697
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,471
So do I.

698
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,878
(voice breaks)
I'll try not to let you all down, Dad.

699
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,111
- What did you say?
- It's OK, it's just jet lag.

700
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,191
Don't pay any attention to me.

701
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,752
(lift pings)

702
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,876
I felt sick going into the office...

703
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,952
...seeing all the people
I'd been avoiding for months.

704
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,068
It was one thing to con people over the
phone, quite another to do it to their face.

705
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,151
Nick? That's you, isn't it?

706
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,554
Nick Leeson? I heard you were coming
in.

707
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,831
You haven't the vaguest idea
who I am, have you?

708
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,708
Brenda?

709
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,555
- Of course. I'm sorry. How are you?
- So I finally get to put a face to the voice!

710
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,428
- My God, you are so young!
- Well, ageing rapidly, I'm afraid.

711
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,877
Can you come into my office? I really do
need to talk to you about the figures.

712
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,394
I'm meeting Peter Norris in three minutes.

713
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,675
Oh. Well, do come in right after, OK?

714
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,558
Nobody out there can answer
our questions but you.

715
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,837
And they just asked for
another ton of funding.

716
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,911
- All right. This one?
- Yeah.

717
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,716
Brenda was my cash lifeline.

718
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,156
She was the last person I wanted
asking awkward questions.

719
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,908
But first I had to deal with Peter Norris.

720
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,470
He's such a red-hot trader
I'm having him come in overnight!

721
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,198
Are you really?

722
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,717
You can't keep Nick away from the floor.
He's the key man in Singapore.

723
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,314
Sounds like you're the key man in Asia.

724
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,039
He's insane! You should see
how he takes that market on.

725
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,918
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Yes, it's all right.

726
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,991
(both) "All right"?

727
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,951
(they laugh)

728
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,114
Now, we need to talk about merging the
sales areas in Asia. Nick has some views.

729
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,590
If we can replicate his success
in Hong Kong and Tokyo...

730
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,516
What do you think, Nick?

731
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,750
It does make a lot of sense to merge.

732
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,319
There would need to be
controls, of course...

733
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,997
...but the trading books can be used to
supplement a customer's requirements...

734
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,389
...and increase information flows.

735
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,516
Synergetically.

736
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,431
Exactly. Synergy.

737
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,636
So you see, Peter, Nick agrees.

738
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,349
And he's been very successful
with his customers. They love him!

739
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,919
Yes, excellent.
Well, keep up the good work...

740
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,072
...and Ron, you sort out
what you want with this merger.

741
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,230
Now, gentlemen, I really have to...

742
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,073
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Cheers.

743
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,597
I think that went well.
He seemed to go for the merger idea.

744
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,719
- Oh, he did. He really went for it!
- This'll be good for you too, Nick.

745
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,759
They'll give you some kind of
fancy new title! (chuckles)

746
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,831
Uh... Nick!

747
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,312
Nick!

748
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,391
Ron!

749
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,513
Being good...

750
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,989
...is not good enough!

751
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,951
Everyone must be connected to
our strategy, or we will find you...

752
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,110
...and weed you out!

753
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,630
Information arbitrage is our business.

754
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,838
If you don't know what an
information curve is, then find out!

755
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,870
Position yourself in an information curve.

756
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,870
Dominate the curve!

757
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,670
Nick Leeson, who most of you know
and all of you have heard of...

758
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,955
...runs our operation in Singapore...

759
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,713
...which I want all of you to try to emulate.

760
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,837
Now, you'll hear later from Nick
about how he does it...

761
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,276
...but I just want to
drive home to you guys...

762
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,477
...that if you could all think about Nick...

763
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,712
...and perhaps come up with ideas
to follow his footsteps...

764
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,314
...Barings will become...

765
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,793
...one of the most successful operations
in the derivatives business.

766
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,871
(retches)

767
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,836
Oh, fuck!

768
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,313
Oh, we are gonna make so much money!

769
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,590
But more to the point...

770
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,989
...you are gonna make...

771
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,149
...so...

772
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,389
...much...

773
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,629
...money.

774
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,391
Oh, Nick!

775
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,191
Nick... wake up.

776
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,033
- Lisa...
- We're meant to be going to the dinner!

777
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,078
I can't. I can't face it.
I can't take it any more.

778
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,038
I'm not going back after Christmas.
You can't make me.

779
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,237
What?! You're sitting next to
Peter Norris in the seat of honour!

780
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,039
Don't tell me you missed
your presentation too.

781
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,192
- I've been drinkin'.
- I never would have guessed(!)

782
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,397
I think it's downright rude.
You can't let everybody down.

783
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,630
You don't understand, Lisa.

784
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,110
I'm sitting on a fuckin' volcano.
I can't go back!

785
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,395
And what about your bonus?

786
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,948
Now, stop babblin'
and get yourself dressed!

787
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,918
I'll give you volcano, Nick Leeson -
right up your bum!

788
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,353
Lisa... oi!

789
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,396
In you go! You stink!

790
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,358
- Oh, Lisa...
- (cackles)

791
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,031
You bitch!

792
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,079
- I'm gonna kill you now!
- Look at you! What a disgusting sight!

793
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,640
Aagh, no, you're gonna
get me all wet, Nick!

794
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,711
Oh!

795
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,231
(Lisa laughs)

796
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,558
Nick. You've got to get dressed. Stop.

797
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,510
You've got to get dressed! (laughs)

798
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,554
Promise me you'll always love me, Lisa.

799
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,119
That whatever happens,
you'll always love me.

800
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,395
Oh, of course I will!

801
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,471
You're my man, aren't you?

802
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,956
It was crazy going back. I couldn't hope
to survive the end-of-year audit.

803
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,112
There was that little matter
of the 7.78 billion yen...

804
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,875
...which I'd fabricated to plug
the hole in the five eights account.

805
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,679
I should have told Lisa
when I had the chance...

806
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,671
...but this voice kept telling me...

807
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,036
...l'd traded out of losses before -
I could trade out of them again.

808
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,795
What's this letter all about?

809
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,797
Well, it's from SIMEX.

810
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,077
Yes, I know it's from SIMEX.
It came while you were away.

811
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,391
"It appears that you have
financed the trading positions...

812
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,436
...held by sub-account 88888."

813
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,717
"If this is the case
you have violated SIMEX Rule 822...

814
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,078
...which bans members from financing
the trading margins of their customers."

815
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,436
They're just banging on about
our intra-day funding limits.

816
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,590
Well, what is sub-account 88888 anyway?

817
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,036
It's a customer account.
We have umpteen trading accounts.

818
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,190
I'd have to look into it.

819
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,829
We're the number one trader,
and they're tying us up in red tape.

820
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,559
Anyone would think
they didn't want us to trade.

821
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,551
Er... I'll draft an answer for you.

822
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,871
Yeah, do that, will you?
Get it on my desk by the morning.

823
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,349
Of course, Simon.

824
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,431
Lisa?

825
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,398
Lisa?

826
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,471
Lisa, what are you doing?

827
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,716
I'm bleeding, Nick!

828
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,030
(siren)

829
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,150
Why didn't you tell me?

830
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,231
Cos I was waiting till I was sure!

831
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,399
- You're not angry with me, are you?
- Of course I'm not angry, my love.

832
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,631
- You want the baby, don't you?
- I really want the baby.

833
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,188
I want lots and lots of babies. All right?

834
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,998
(whimpers) Yeah.

835
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,110
Your wife is OK...

836
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,191
I'm afraid she's lost the baby.

837
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,591
I'm sorry.

838
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,791
(roar of voices from the floor)

839
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,996
That was the turning point.

840
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,311
That was when I decided
I couldn't stand around any longer...

841
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,119
...hoping the market
would move in my favour.

842
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,997
I was gonna have to make it move.

843
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,349
I didn't care how much money it took.

844
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,510
I was gonna go for broke.

845
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,914
The man is single-handedly generating
a fifth of the group's worldwide profits!

846
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,391
I know. But $30 million in margin
payments? For one day's trading?

847
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,711
You don't seem to understand.
The volumes are enormous!

848
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,155
Nick's guy is the biggest
player on SIMEX!

849
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,671
(phone rings)

850
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,838
- Hello?
- Nick.

851
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,876
It's Brenda.

852
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,274
Listen, buddy. This is putting
a terrible strain on our borrowing.

853
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,193
Tony Hawes is all over me
about your cash calls.

854
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,716
I hear you. But London is
the cash cow for the business here.

855
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,394
We just don't have access
to any other funds.

856
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,997
If you keep hassling me
I've a good mind to stop trading.

857
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,317
No, no, Nick. It's OK. Listen...

858
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,188
Just get back to me with
some meaningful figures, OK?

859
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,031
(whispers) Fuck off.

860
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,351
(phone rings)

861
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,393
Hello?

862
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,075
Thank goodness I caught you.
I know Brenda's giving you a hard time...

863
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,832
I don't think any of you understand
how it works out here.

864
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,593
You may be right, mate.
Anyway, consider it sorted.

865
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,717
But you are gonna have to start
reducing these positions.

866
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,758
Well, Ron, I'll see
what I can do, all right?

867
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,229
While I've got you, about your bonus...

868
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,950
The budget's tight. Though you've been
exceptional there's not much to go round.

869
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,031
I thought we had a record year!

870
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,591
Yeah. That said, I've put in a special plea
to Peter and he's agreed to go up to 350.

871
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,398
350? That's ridiculous!

872
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,153
I'm really pushing out
the boat for you, mate.

873
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,516
I'm busting my balls here.
I made us the top house in SIMEX.

874
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,592
We even got that award
for all the business we're doing!

875
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,989
Yeah, I know that, Nick.

876
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,071
Look, I'll see what I can do.

877
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,913
I'll see if it can't start with a four, eh?

878
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,956
(splashing from bathroom)

879
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,951
That was their opening offer.

880
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,113
He'd have thought something was wrong
if I'd accepted it straight away.

881
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,475
Yeah, it's like winning the lottery.

882
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,551
They must think the world of you.

883
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,356
What's the matter, Lisa?

884
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,159
What do you think's
the bloody matter, Nick?

885
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,231
Everything's changed!

886
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,396
I just wanna go home.
Get the hell out of here and go home.

887
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,552
But... you wanted to come back.
What about the bonus?

888
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,393
Well, can't you get the bonus in London?

889
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,948
Please, Nick! I wanna get on with my life.

890
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,555
I wanna start a family.
I'm going stir-crazy here all on my own!

891
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,794
Calm down. Look, I just need a bit more
time to sort things out, turn things around.

892
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,476
No! You're up at dawn and then you come
back at night and collapse into bed...

893
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,870
How am I meant to get pregnant again
if we never make love?

894
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,872
I know. But this could set us up for life!

895
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,676
- When's bonus day?
- 24th of February. Just five weeks to go.

896
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,320
Right, we're gonna leave on the 25th.

897
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,676
I mean it. I'm calling
the furniture removers tomorrow.

898
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,751
All right.

899
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,591
All right.

900
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,718
With everything else closing in on me,
I'd forgotten about the mooning charge.

901
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,190
When it finally came up,
I was facing a possible jail sentence.

902
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,273
The charge has been reduced
to a misdemeanour.

903
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,512
The maximum penalty is a $200 fine.
I think we should plead guilty.

904
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,556
Thank you very much.

905
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,473
It was uncanny.
I'd got away with it again!

906
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:08,076
To the Singapore legal system,
a shining example to the free world!

907
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,754
We bared our all for Barings.

908
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,718
Bearer bonds takes on
a whole new meaning after this!

909
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,199
(phone rings)

910
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,317
Talk about a bear market!
Hello? Mooners Anonymous.

911
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,312
This is Wei Wei from
Coopers & Lybrand. Is that Nick?

912
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,833
Speaking.

913
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,596
I'm compiling the end-of-year audit. There
seems to be a big hole in the accounts.

914
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,194
I'm missing the 7.78 billion yen...

915
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,271
...receivable from SIMEX.

916
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,630
Nick, can you hear me?

917
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,188
Is everything all right?

918
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,360
It's a little complicated.
What do you need?

919
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,271
I can't find any paperwork.

920
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,355
It was an over-the-counter trade
between Speer, Leads and Kellagg...

921
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,432
...and Barings London.
It fell through the computer system.

922
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,636
I'll have a word with
the systems manager.

923
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,676
I need three bits of paper.

924
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,275
One: confirmation from SLK
that the 7.78 billion yen will be paid.

925
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,511
Two: sight of your bank balance
to show it's been received.

926
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,754
And three: a note from Ron Baker saying
he's aware of the deal and approves it.

927
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,831
(line goes dead)

928
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,871
Well?

929
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,757
Oh, it's just a computer glitch.

930
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,400
They're doing their annual audit.

931
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,948
(laughs)

932
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,790
And so, with scissors and paste,
I created $78 million out of thin air.

933
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,469
This was forgery, pure and simple...

934
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,590
...and there was no going back.

935
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,636
- Nick!
- Simon.

936
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,870
Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!

937
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,794
- What's this missing seven billion yen?
- Oh, that's a nightmare.

938
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,440
It's an OTC trade
that was incorrectly booked.

939
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,829
The auditors are really
on my case about it.

940
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,878
It's a pain in the arse,
but we've got to get it sorted.

941
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,235
The point is, we're owed
the money by SLK.

942
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,958
Who the hell are SLK?

943
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,918
Speer, Leads and Kellagg.
It's a brokerage house.

944
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,356
Better send me a memo as soon as.
Get these auditors off my back.

945
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,829
Sure, Simon. Don't worry, I'm onto it.

946
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,951
(phone rings)

947
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,109
Bonnie, it's Nick. Listen.
Listen very carefully.

948
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,797
Transfer 7.78 billion yen from the client
account to the house account tomorrow.

949
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,393
But it won't go!

950
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,277
There isn't enough money.

951
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,751
I know that, but then you can reverse it.
It's just an electronic transaction.

952
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,752
But I want the transfer done.
And I want the bank...

953
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,550
...to send us a fax of the statement,
showing the 7.78 billion yen credit.

954
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,550
All right, Nick. If you say so.

955
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,198
Cheers, Bonnie.

956
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,877
Nick?

957
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,155
What's all this about seven billion yen?

958
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,198
Someone from London, Tony Hawes,
was looking for you.

959
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,829
Jesus Christ, if I hear any more
about this seven billion yen...

960
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,036
It's about $70 million, innit?

961
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,997
What do you reckon? Red or blue?

962
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,878
You think I just walked off
with $70 million?

963
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,359
I didn't say that.

964
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,396
It's a computer error.

965
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,429
You need someone in the back office,
I told you. You're not bloomin' Superman!

966
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,158
Don't start all that again.

967
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,515
It wouldn't have happened
if I'd been there.

968
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,190
Right. I'm goin' out.

969
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,555
- Where are you going?
- To get pissed.

970
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,518
If anyone calls, tell 'em
I've gone to South America.

971
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,160
Well, you can bloody stay there, then!

972
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,231
Twat!

973
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,552
(key in door)

974
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,399
What have you done now, Leeson?

975
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,471
What have you done now?

976
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,793
- (knock on door)
- Come in.

977
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,758
I thought you'd like to know
the audit's been cleared.

978
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,719
- Nick sent the papers. Everyone's happy.
- Thanks, Ron.

979
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,112
Technically we've breached SIMEX rules,
but it was just a non-transaction.

980
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,758
With any luck...

981
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,311
...the auditors won't mention it, or we may
have problems with the local regulator.

982
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,630
Sounds sensible.

983
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:22,714
Do you know, Nick made $10 million
doing arbitrage in a week?

984
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,553
That's about...
half a billion dollars a year.

985
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,710
The guy's a turbo arbitrageur!

986
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,588
If he's doing that amount of business
for that amount of profit...

987
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,309
...why don't we shut down the rest
of the bank? We're just overhead.

988
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,958
Yeah!

989
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,991
(phone rings)

990
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,030
- Hello?
- Nick...

991
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,953
...are you avoiding me?
I've been trying you for days.

992
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,837
Sorry, Tony, it's been chaos.

993
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,309
The audit went through.
I thought you knew.

994
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,392
- It's this SLK thing.
- It's all been cleared up.

995
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,676
I know. What's bothering me is where
you got all the money to actually...

996
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,716
...well, pay SLK in the first place.

997
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,268
I mean, it's the equivalent of $78 million!

998
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,351
It doesn't add up, you know.

999
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:17,429
It's obvious. It's part of the funding we've
had from you over the past few weeks.

1000
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,555
Yes.

1001
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,030
So, the same figure will flow back to you.

1002
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,352
I see. You're saying that some of
the funding was used to pay SLK?

1003
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,910
That's right, Tony.
So we'll be able to pay it back to you.

1004
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,276
That'll be good. Er...
getting our funding down will be good.

1005
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,590
I'm having to juggle quite a few balls.

1006
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,796
We all are, Tony. Look, I've got to dash.

1007
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,677
I've got company for dinner.

1008
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,558
- Of course. Thanks, Nick.
- (Nick hangs up abruptly)

1009
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,631
Thanks for... clearing that up.

1010
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,791
(phone rings)

1011
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,196
Yes, Ron. What do you want?

1012
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,953
It's me, you wanker! Danny.

1013
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,555
Bubble? What are you doing
calling me in the middle of the night?

1014
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,517
Are you anywhere near a TV?

1015
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,795
I suggest you tune in to CNN.

1016
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,877
The worst damage was in
the seaport of Kobe.

1017
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,269
Road and rail links are shattered...

1018
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,992
Jesus, an earthquake!
That's all we fuckin' need.

1019
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,391
This is gonna kill the market, man.

1020
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,313
The Nikkei's gonna fall
through the fuckin' floor!

1021
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,709
...milling around in search of help.

1022
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,917
Rescue operations are going
to be complicated, long...

1023
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,676
...and expensive. Mike Chinoy,
CNN, reporting live from Tokyo.

1024
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,751
(uproar)

1025
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,074
Market's down 300 points, you stand
there cool as a fuckin' cucumber.

1026
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,230
The way I see it, it's an opportunity.

1027
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,552
I'm gonna buy into the market.
Buy it all the way back up to 19,000.

1028
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,914
Oi!

1029
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,437
Fuckin' true what they say
about your gonads, mate.

1030
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,471
See what I mean?

1031
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,076
Think I'll give Fernando a bell in Tokyo,
see what's shakin'. No pun intended.

1032
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,549
It's Nick. What's the situation in Kobe?

1033
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,713
We've been trying to contact our friends,
but the lines are down.

1034
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,711
Hold it a second. We got movement.

1035
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,031
Holy shit, selling! There's some selling!

1036
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,876
Fuckin' hell, it's in free fall!

1037
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,951
I've never seen it move so fast.

1038
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,992
350! 350!

1039
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,399
350!

1040
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,950
Nick?

1041
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,031
Sure you don't want us to stay?

1042
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,516
No, I... I'm fine. You go.

1043
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,670
You'll make it right, Nick.

1044
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,157
We all believe in you.

1045
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,551
50 million!

1046
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,998
I...

1047
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,389
...Nicholas Leeson...

1048
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,311
...have lost...

1049
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,391
...50 million quid...

1050
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,311
...in one day!

1051
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,276
What does he do, exactly?

1052
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,828
That's what no one seems able to explain.

1053
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,629
It's simple. He switches contracts
between Osaka and SIMEX...

1054
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,996
...exploiting price differentials
between the two markets.

1055
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,913
That's how he offers the best deals
to our customers.

1056
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,753
If it's that easy,
why isn't everybody doing it?

1057
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:27,311
Because he's absolutely in the vortex
of the information curve over there.

1058
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,312
He's discovered a whole
new way of making money.

1059
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,272
Well, he's giving us horrendous
funding problems, that's all I know.

1060
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,513
He doesn't do things by the book, Ron.
He just doesn't respect the rules.

1061
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,309
Is he really the kind of person
we should be employing at Barings?

1062
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:49,349
Oh, fuck the rules. It's barrow boys like
Nick who are turning the City around.

1063
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,831
You can't run a modern financial centre
with a bunch of Hooray Henries.

1064
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,959
Bastard!

1065
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,031
Wakey-wakey!

1066
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,955
- What's the action, mate?
- You tell me.

1067
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,918
The market's up and down
like a tart's knickers.

1068
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,197
- I think the worst is over.
- Who knows? You could be right.

1069
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,236
Well, that's my hunch anyway.

1070
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,914
Listen, I was out last night with that Loy.

1071
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,036
You know, that journo from Reuters.

1072
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,634
He's convinced
there's no mystery customer.

1073
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,349
He reckons it's you. He thinks
you're trading on your own account.

1074
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,396
Without the bank's approval.

1075
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,716
Now, you're not that crazy, are you?

1076
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,677
What do you think?

1077
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,036
Who, then? Beaumarchais?
I thought he'd given you the elbow.

1078
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,271
- I can't tell you.
- Come on. It's me, Danny Boy!

1079
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,670
I could tell you... but I'd
have to shoot you afterwards.

1080
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,433
I know one thing.
If Customer X didn't exist...

1081
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,556
...you'd have to invent him.

1082
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,319
45 million?
You've already had 100 this week.

1083
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,791
Everybody's had an advance margin call
from SIMEX on their client positions.

1084
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,077
They're worried about stability
with these big movements.

1085
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,151
It's an emergency measure(?)

1086
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,271
Isn't everybody squealing out there?

1087
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,352
No, we'll get it back
when the market calms down.

1088
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,392
Nick, when are you gonna
reduce these positions?

1089
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,869
The bean counters are freakin' out!

1090
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,394
Ron! Didn't know you were there.

1091
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,075
For fuck's sake, we've had
the Bank of International Settlements...

1092
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,720
...asking if Barings can
meet its margin payments!

1093
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,509
- It is not good for the image!
- I hear you, Ron. It's a tight market.

1094
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,795
Yeah, well, you've really gotta try.

1095
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,871
Take a hit on it if you have to.

1096
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,238
I know Norris is gonna want to discuss it
with you when he's out there next week.

1097
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,992
Norris?

1098
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,718
- I didn't know he was coming.
- Yeah, with Tony Hawes.

1099
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,112
They want to check the numbers. Iron out
these funding problems once and for all!

1100
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,989
(thunder)

1101
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,678
There was no way I could reduce my
positions without the market collapsing.

1102
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:03,470
By the time they got to Singapore I was in
deeper than ever, faxing Brenda daily...

1103
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,313
...30, 40 million dollars at a time.

1104
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,551
They were gonna kill me.

1105
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,271
Lookin' like shit, Nick.

1106
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,910
Lookin' like fuckin' shit, mate.

1107
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,830
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1108
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,071
(laughter and chat)

1109
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,517
(Hawes) His approach shot
sliced into the woods...

1110
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,910
- Nick. There you are.
- I'm sorry I'm a little bit late.

1111
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,719
- What'll you have?
- A beer would be great, thanks.

1112
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,791
Another Tiger, please.

1113
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,231
Nick...

1114
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,876
- How was the market today?
- It stayed between 18,000 and 18,300.

1115
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,951
It's settled after the earthquake.

1116
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,315
Happy with the positions you're running?

1117
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,790
I'm relaxed. They're March contracts,
so I'll let them expire.

1118
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,598
- Good.
- Thanks.

1119
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,637
Now, we've had a lot of stick...
over funding.

1120
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,998
Brenda Granger tells me we're borrowing
all over Japan to get the funds to you.

1121
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,275
People are beginning to talk, Nick.

1122
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,476
I understand.

1123
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,391
I understand completely.

1124
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,552
Excellent.

1125
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,631
Good man.

1126
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:49,399
And that was it. That was apparently
all he had to say on the subject...

1127
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:54,076
...of my enormous exposure causing
so many ulcers throughout Barings.

1128
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,913
Better than you get in London,
that's for sure!

1129
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,877
You'll enjoy the next course.

1130
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,952
- Lobster, sir?
- No, thanks. I'm not very hungry.

1131
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,679
I should have been able
to relax after that...

1132
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:09,117
...but I couldn't stop thinking about
the losses in the five eights account.

1133
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,714
Shame you can't stay
for the match on Saturday.

1134
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,791
(voices echo)

1135
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,671
(Hawes) You're down for 450, aren't you?

1136
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,750
Your bonus.

1137
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,876
Only a week to go.

1138
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,913
Sorry?

1139
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,516
Have you thought about what you're
going to do with it? Only a week to go!

1140
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,032
Ahem! Excuse me.
I have an announcement to make.

1141
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,633
I know that some of you are worried
about our exposure in the market...

1142
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:51,635
...and you're probably wondering about
the identity of our mystery Customer X.

1143
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,829
Well, the fact is...

1144
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,911
...he doesn't exist.

1145
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,910
We are the customer: Barings.

1146
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,514
Look properly at
the five eights account -

1147
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,876
...which is not a client account,
it's an errors account -

1148
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,511
...and you'll realise it's concealing
losses in the region of 200 million.

1149
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,159
No, I tell a lie.
It's more like 230 after today!

1150
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,157
What are you going to do
with all that money, Nick?

1151
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,994
Well, I won't spend it
on futures and options!

1152
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,916
- That's very good.
- Very good.

1153
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,837
I was living from day to day,
hoping for a miracle.

1154
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:00,359
I wasn't running a position any more.
The position was running me.

1155
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,077
Man, look at the state you're in.
You got the bloody shakes!

1156
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,799
- You been on the razz all night?
- Nah.

1157
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,031
- I'm just getting killed by the market.
- Tell me about it!

1158
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,111
I've had a shitty week too.

1159
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,631
Penguin? You lucky sod!

1160
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,356
Do you know how rare they are?

1161
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,431
Do you know?

1162
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,672
- It ain't that bloody funny!
- Lucky Leeson(!)

1163
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,513
You have it.
I'm not laughing at you, Bubble.

1164
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,351
Fuck! Sorry.

1165
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,276
'Ey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
You really are in a bad way, ain't ya?

1166
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,911
What's the matter?

1167
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,630
I have an unauthorised position.

1168
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,791
Fuckin' hell.

1169
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,199
How big?

1170
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,271
Big enough to be a problem.

1171
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,472
Poor bastard!

1172
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,393
I can't say it comes as
a complete surprise.

1173
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,710
- Does Lisa know?
- No, she'd kill me.

1174
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,116
She's got enough on her plate. She's just
waiting for my bonus so we can go home!

1175
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,191
So what are you gonna do?

1176
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,237
Well... I just have to keep buying
futures to support the market.

1177
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,474
If it sticks at 18,000, my options are still in
the money - I could get the position back.

1178
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,279
- I may even come out ahead.
- Nick...

1179
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,316
You listen to me now, right.

1180
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,391
You don't fight the market, man.

1181
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,792
Even if you can make the margin calls,
what happens when the contracts expire?

1182
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,509
The way the market's going,
your losses could be catastrophic!

1183
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,399
Five for a thousand,
five for a thousand! Come on!

1184
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,553
George, move this fuckin' market!
If it stays below 18,000 we're dead!

1185
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,951
Come on!

1186
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,989
Nick.

1187
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,829
- Nick!
- Tony.

1188
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,390
Nick, I really need to go over
some of the figures with you.

1189
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,471
Sure, Tony.

1190
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,038
Back in a minute.

1191
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,711
Seven for five! Seven for five!

1192
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,638
I'm sorry. Money!

1193
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,353
I'd thrown away countless more millions,
and it hadn't made a dent.

1194
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,955
I was only one day from bonus day,
but the game was up.

1195
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,511
I was beaten.

1196
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,513
Oh, Nick, you're a bloody fool, aren't you?

1197
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,351
Well, it's not the end of the world.
You've got your health, you've got me...

1198
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,396
Shame about the bonus.

1199
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,471
Sorry.

1200
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,435
Slow down.
The video shop's on the next left.

1201
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,670
- I wanna get our deposit back.
- Right.

1202
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,910
We're gonna need it, darlin'.

1203
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,111
(phone rings)

1204
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,672
- Hello?
- (Baker) The positions have got bigger!

1205
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,116
If they aren't reduced
I'm coming out there to sort you out!

1206
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,317
- You're very faint, Ron.
- And what's this rumour I hear?

1207
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,709
There's a rumour that we're the customer.

1208
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,870
Sorry, you're gonna have to speak up.

1209
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,235
Tell me we're not the customer, Nick.

1210
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,392
- I'm losing you, Ron.
- Nick! Nick, are you there?

1211
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,471
Goodbye, Ron.

1212
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,871
They wouldn't give me the full 200,
but I stood my ground and got 180.

1213
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,951
Good girl.

1214
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,672
Nick...!

1215
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,751
(phone rings)

1216
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,394
Excuse me, sir.
There's a phone call for you.

1217
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,472
- Not now.
- It's Peter Norris. He said it's urgent.

1218
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,118
Oh. Thank you.

1219
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,031
Would you excuse me?

1220
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,719
Peter?

1221
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,837
I'm sorry to drag you away
from your dinner party.

1222
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,559
I'm afraid I've got some rather bad news.

1223
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,311
By the time the shit hit the proverbial fan
in London we'd escaped Singapore...

1224
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,358
...to ponder the future
and consider my options.

1225
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,317
If I had any.

1226
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,271
What's gonna happen, Nick?

1227
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,834
They must have got my fax and
closed down all the positions on Friday.

1228
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,036
The market seems to be holding up OK.

1229
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,270
But you're definitely out of a job?

1230
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:26,319
It could have been a lot worse,
but I still lost them a ton of money.

1231
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,589
I'm starving! Think they do burgers here?

1232
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,955
(laughs) No! You're not having a burger.

1233
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,794
- That tummy of yours is driving me nuts.
- Don't stress me, wench!

1234
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,438
(laughs)

1235
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,511
I'll work it off in the gym.

1236
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,311
Better still...

1237
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,274
(kissing)

1238
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,319
- Stop it. People are watching.
- So? I don't care. Come here, girl.

1239
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,999
Jesus Christ, Lisa!

1240
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,195
- Barings has gone bust!
- What?!

1241
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,472
The Chancellor of the Exchequer
is trying to calm fears...

1242
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,348
...sparked by the failure of Barings Bank.
In a statement to Parliament...

1243
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,149
...he denied reports that the British
banking system is about to collapse.

1244
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:23,074
According to him, Barings'
failure is a unique situation...

1245
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,869
...which he blames on the actions
of a rogue trader in Singapore.

1246
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,432
Estimates of potential losses range from
800 million to over one billion pounds.

1247
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,638
There's no way of knowing how markets
will react when they reopen on Monday.

1248
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,110
As the Bank of England tries to
put together a rescue package...

1249
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:44,637
...with the Sultan of Brunei rumoured
as a buyer, time may be running out...

1250
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,235
...for one of Britain's most
venerable financial institutions.

1251
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,595
Charles Samson, CNN, London.

1252
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,671
(whispers) Fuck!

1253
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,517
Oh, Nick!

1254
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,156
How could you not tell me?

1255
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,869
How could you have kept it hidden
for all this time, Nick?

1256
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,156
You must have been through hell!

1257
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,516
You would have marched me
straight into Simon Jones's office.

1258
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,034
- Too bloody right!
- Then I'd have got fired...

1259
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,556
...and I couldn't have made the money
back. That's all I was gonna do.

1260
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,835
No, but you were gambling.

1261
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,356
That's what you were doing.
With other people's money.

1262
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,750
I didn't want to let everyone down.

1263
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,557
You, my dad, the girls in the office...

1264
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,391
Even Ron bloody Baker!

1265
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,559
Do you think they're all
gonna hate me now?

1266
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,552
Well, I don't think you're
gonna be Mr Popular!

1267
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,434
It could easily have been
the other way, you know.

1268
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,471
It so nearly was.

1269
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,031
Then I'd be a hero.

1270
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,951
Oh...!

1271
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,110
(whispers) Come here. Come here.

1272
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,111
I still love ya. Mm?

1273
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,677
- (whispers) I love you very much.
- I love you too.

1274
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,075
Shall we see if I can do
something about that belly?

1275
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,151
I see.

1276
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,271
Yes, I understand.

1277
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,476
No, of course.

1278
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,355
Thank you again for your efforts.

1279
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,839
Goodbye.

1280
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,513
That was the Sultan of Brunei's office.
They have decided not to proceed.

1281
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,912
They believe the risks are too great and
the time too short, in view of the need...

1282
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,437
...to have a rescue package ready by the
time markets open again in the Far East.

1283
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,511
Is there really no one else?

1284
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,549
We've tried everyone. It's hopeless.

1285
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:07,759
I therefore have to inform you
that Barings is insolvent...

1286
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,513
...and will go into immediate liquidation.

1287
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,591
(sobs)

1288
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,192
Peter Barings has gone on TV
and said there's been a conspiracy.

1289
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,998
They've lost 800 million quid!

1290
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,548
I lost nowhere near that.
It was more like 300!

1291
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:30,031
But Barings didn't do anything Friday.
Now the word's out, the market's crashed.

1292
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,633
Bloody idiots!

1293
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,711
They think you've run off on your yacht.

1294
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,836
- What?!
- I know. But listen, mate.

1295
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,356
You've got no friends here now,
so just get the fuck out of Asia.

1296
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,193
Get back to London, Australia, anywhere.
Just get out.

1297
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,838
We're tryin'.

1298
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,276
Oi, Nick...
get yourself a good lawyer.

1299
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,351
- Be lucky.
- Cheers, mate.

1300
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,230
(Tannoy) Flight 187 to Hong Kong...

1301
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,311
...leaving from gate two.

1302
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:57,948
Fuck!

1303
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:09,917
There's a manhunt all over Asia. They
think we're sailing around in our yacht!

1304
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,549
- What bloody yacht?
- I know. What about the flights?

1305
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,757
- There's one to London. Via Singapore.
- That's no good.

1306
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,513
There's a flight to Frankfurt.
Via Abu Dhabi.

1307
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,158
Let's take it.

1308
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,912
And Lisa...

1309
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,991
Pay cash.

1310
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,596
- Newspaper, sir?
- No, thank you.

1311
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,671
- Ma'am?
- Er... no, thanks.

1312
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,156
Nick, take that thing off.

1313
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:26,152
There's a guy over there lookin' at me.

1314
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,708
I'm not surprised, with that bloody hat on!

1315
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,191
Talk about conspicuous! You're
sticking out like a sore bloody thumb.

1316
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,795
Did you say we stop at Abu Dhabi?

1317
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,110
Yeah.

1318
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,239
- That's where they cut your hands off.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous!

1319
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,071
They just stone you.

1320
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,430
What?

1321
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,670
I'm sorry, but you've gotta laugh!

1322
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,630
Poor old Barings, eh? That's what you get
for hiring the wrong sort of person.

1323
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,268
That was when it hit me -

1324
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,351
...the enormity of what I'd done.

1325
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,034
Whatever happened, I knew things
were never gonna be the same again.

1326
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,793
And I've never felt lonelier in all my life.

1327
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,110
I love you, Lisa.

1328
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,191
Whatever happens, I love you.

1329
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,831
I love you too.

1330
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,791
I've got to get back to London.

1331
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:49,833
I couldn't stand being in jail in Singapore.
I couldn't stand it if I couldn't see you.

1332
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,911
Jesus Christ, it's the police!

1333
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,036
They must know I'm on the flight.

1334
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,350
Well... no, not necessarily.

1335
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:07,758
Due to our early arrival, passport control
will take place as you leave the plane.

1336
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,910
Please have your documents ready.

1337
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,515
See?

1338
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,071
I'm scared, Lisa!

1339
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,631
You be strong, OK?

1340
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,199
Danke.

1341
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,998
Pass, bitte.

1342
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,753
Danke. Thank you.

1343
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,631
Please show your passport.

1344
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,677
Where is your man?

1345
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,591
I'm her man.

1346
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,671
(uproar)

1347
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:14,117
250 bid on 100! 250 bid on 100! Come on!

1348
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:18,034
Who wants some of that?
250 bid on 100! 250 bid on 100! Come on!

1349
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,549
# Aria from Mozart's "The Magic Flute"

1350
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,356
And that's it, more or less.
That's the end of my story.

1351
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:46,390
Barings was eventually sold to the Dutch
bank ING for the princely sum of 1.

1352
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,315
Lisa's got a new life as a flight
attendant for Virgin Atlantic.

1353
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,595
I hear she's got herself a new fella.

1354
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:00,109
As for me, I fought unsuccessfully
against extradition...

1355
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:05,194
...from Frankfurt to Singapore on charges
of fraud, forgery and breach of trust.

1356
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,312
I was sentenced to
six and a half years in prison.

1357
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,795
Despite rumours of secret
bank accounts and hidden millions...

1358
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,395
...I did not profit personally
from my unlawful trading.

1359
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,195
To be absolutely honest...

1360
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,271
...sometimes I wish I had.

1361
01:33:56,280 --> 01:34:02,071
# I've got something to say

1362
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:12,989
