1
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:17,019
Obsolete.

2
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,509
Irrelevant.

3
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,650
In an age when desire
has become amplified,

4
00:00:22,744 --> 00:00:25,751
but where lust can be
sated electronically,

5
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,723
we need something more
than just a wooden box.

6
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,614
There is a mechanism.

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,109
The house is ready,
we can adapt.

8
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:34,835
Technology may have advanced

9
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:37,382
but sin remains unchanged.

10
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:40,242
Pure. Greed.

11
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,118
Lust. Lies. Betrayal.

12
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:46,366
This new millennium
hurtles forward.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,878
Faith is lost.

14
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:51,565
Mankind has become a
vacuum without morality.

15
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:55,011
So many souls seeking new
and darkened experiences.

16
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:58,581
Degradation upon degradation,
sin after sin.

17
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:03,052
So then those are the souls
we shall seek out first.

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,240
<i>"Mr. Watkins,</i>

19
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,741

00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:41,046

00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:50,077

25
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,533
Ah, Mr. Watkins.

26
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:16,934
So good of you to come.

27
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:18,908
We have such sights
to show you.

28
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,932
Please, step inside.

29
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,314
Mr. Watkins.

30
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,353
The fuck is going on?

31
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:46,379
Who the fuck are you?

32
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:48,201
What are you doing to me?

33
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:50,091
That's all-all valid questions.

34
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,758
What the fuck is going on?!

35
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,372
Mr. Watkins, please.

36
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,241
Please assist your situation.

37
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,737
Look at your environment.

38
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,409
For now, you are merely captive

39
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,195
sitting tied to a chair.

40
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,562
If we wanted you killed,
you would be.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,049
We have simply invited
you here to talk.

42
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,329
To hear your
thoughts and desires.

43
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,053
Furthermore, if they're as
interesting and illuminating

44
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,342
as I believe them to be,

45
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:14,755
then your reward will be
beyond your belief.

46
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,099
A reward?

47
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:20,316
A reward tailored for a man of
your particular tastes and desires.

48
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,629
You know about me?

49
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:24,933
You know the things I've done?

50
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,964
It was that resume of
yours that led us to you

51
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,683
and in turn, you to us.

52
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,849
Who are you?

53
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,572
Yes. Perhaps a
little illumination.

54
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:35,134
Please, try not to be too alarmed.

55
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:42,517
Oh, Jesus Christ!

56
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,054
Heavens, no.

57
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,705
Same city, completely
different zip code.

58
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,787
What is going on here?
What-where am I?

59
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,427
Mr. Watkins, we really
must begin your interview.

60
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,383
So many people for you to see.

61
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,833
So, let's just
dive in, shall we?

62
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,009
August 18th, 2001...

63
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:21,033
you lured little
Courtney Rettison to your car.

64
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:22,254
Why?

65
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:25,022
I-I-I never...how do you know...?

66
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:25,898
Please.

67
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:30,158
Let's save ourself the time
and you the considerable pain

68
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,285
by answering
the questions honestly.

69
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,630
Clearly, this is a place

70
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:36,045
where the rules of your
world do not apply.

71
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,357
And obviously, I am
a man for whom pain

72
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:41,934
is nothing more
than a common currency.

73
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:47,013
I will spend some on you...

74
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:49,554
if you like.

75
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:57,023
I'd...seen her at the uh,
the playground before.

76
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,038
I couldn't help myself.

77
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,930
Oh, I understand.

78
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:05,683
I was just tryin' to help.

79
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:06,762
Yes, yes.

80
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:12,109
She had blonde hair.

81
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,787
Long and... it was in a ponytail.

82
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:21,369
Never seen so much blood
from a little creature.

83
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:33,274
My, my, quite the busy bee
with you, Mr. Watkins?

84
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,531
What about my reward?

85
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:37,392
First of all, you will
meet with the Assessor.

86
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,968
He will look over your pages,

87
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,890
pass on his findings to the Jury,

88
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:42,338
and we'll go from there.

89
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:44,691
The Assessor will be
with you shortly.

90
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:16,722
Tears...

91
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:18,488
 of children.

92
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:08,475
What?

93
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:11,895
What?

94
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,257
Serves you right,
you sick fuck!

95
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:32,278
Ladies, your verdict?

96
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:36,946
Guilty.

97
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,202
The Jury has deliberated,

98
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:44,790
and a guilty verdict
has been given.

99
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,622
What?

100
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,221
You'll be taken from
here to be cleaned

101
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:48,135
and then to the Surgeon.

102
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,404
What about my reward?

103
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,986
Your note said you understood.

104
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,876
It said you were a friend.

105
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:57,947
I do understand.
This is your reward.

106
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:01,691
This is what you're
deserving of, my friend.

107
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,746
No!

108
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,406
Please!

109
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,928
I'll be better!

110
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:15,306
I'll be good!

111
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,023
What? Who is it?
Who is it?

112
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,891
Who is it?

113
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,026
Fuck.

114
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:37,046
Please, help me.
Please, help me, please.

115
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,328
No! Please!

116
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,602
Help! What the fuck are you
doing to me? Stop!

117
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,961
You must be cleaned...

118
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,274
on the inside, too.

119
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:05,523
Help!

120
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:13,489
Uber Black, my ass!

121
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:16,292
You're just a...
piece of shit!

122
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:35,625
What the hell?

123
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,112
Josh?

124
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,565
Are you in my apartment again?

125
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:48,146
I told you that you need
to give me my key back.

126
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:52,475
Okay? This late-night
booty call shit is over.

127
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:57,436
Although, I could...
probably go for...

128
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,372
a quickie for...
old times' sake.

129
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,362
Josh...

130
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:12,618
Okay, I'm drying up
real fast here.

131
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:17,616
This...weirdo-in-the-dark thing
is only a turn on for like

132
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,147
a few minutes.

133
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:21,428
And-And where's my dog?

134
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,575
Baby?

135
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,507
Fuck this.

136
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:30,951
Seriously, what the fuck
have you done with the lights?

137
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:46,653
What do you want?

138
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:49,341
To make a lesson out of you.

139
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:04,136
You look like shit.

140
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:07,323
What'd you do last night?

141
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:11,755
Wonderful. Yeah.

142
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,556
I had a great time last
night, thank you for asking.

143
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:19,531
You're gonna take a left

144
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:22,028
two blocks up the way
on Taylor.

145
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:25,233
Victim is one Crystal Lanning,
21 years old.

146
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:26,675
Building super found
her this afternoon.

147
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:28,446
Went out with a girl
called Crystal.

148
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,246
It speaks!

149
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,840
What was that like?

150
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,673
<i>The Tale of Two Cities.</i>

151
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:35,166
The what?

152
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,876
Charles Dickens.

153
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,249
Right.

154
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:40,171
Like anyone reads
that shit anymore.

155
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:43,157
It's the most popular
fictional book on the planet.

156
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:45,479
So why is this Crystal chick
like the book?

157
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,687
Read it.

158
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:51,711
We're here.

159
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:53,237
Good.

160
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,832
<i>worship this little guy.</i>

161
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,181
The place has been
cleared, locked down.

162
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,745
Everyone's been told to hold
back until we make our pass.

163
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:02,334
In case it's him.

164
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,205
<i>worship this little guy.</i>

165
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:07,345
<i>I worship this little guy.</i>

166
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,377
<i>I worship this little guy.</i>

167
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:11,407
<i>I worship this little guy.</i>

168
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,556
<i>I worship this little guy.</i>

169
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,879
<i>-I worship this little guy.</i>
-Nice.

170
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:17,452
<i>I worship this little guy.</i>

171
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,639
<i>I worship this little guy.</i>

172
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,812
<i>I worship this little guy.</i>

173
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:31,634
It's him.

174
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,287
It's definitely him.

175
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:36,739
You think?

176
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:47,145
Doesn't this seem a bit basic
for the Preceptor?

177
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:48,179
The fuck are you?

178
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:50,469
What are you doing creeping around
a murder scene at night time?

179
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,671
You wanna end up dead?

180
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,484
Detectives Carter and Carter.

181
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,375
Brothers in arms...
literally.

182
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,390
Detective Egerton.

183
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,270
I've been assigned to
this case with you.

184
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:02,129
-You got her?
-I got her.

185
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,293
Detective Christine Egerton.

186
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,192
Do you mind?

187
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,347
Why are you here?

188
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:15,863
Who thinks we need
help with this?

189
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,219
Like I was saying,

190
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:20,320
isn't this just a bit basic
for the Preceptor?

191
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:24,238
I mean, I was under the
impression that he liked to shock,

192
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,307
appall, teach.

193
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:27,368
And that?

194
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,945
"I am a jealous God

195
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
thou shalt have no
others unto me?"

196
00:18:30,897 --> 00:18:32,338
It's one of the
remaining commandments.

197
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,590
and is part of his M-O.

198
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,226
I think that it's just a--

199
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:38,502
-What was that?
-Jesus Christ!

200
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:44,322
What the fuck is that?

201
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,846
Has anyone seen
the dog in the video?

202
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,549
Fuck.

203
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:05,820
It's okay.

204
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:07,525
It's okay.

205
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:10,900
Baby.

206
00:19:11,974 --> 00:19:14,732
The dog was her baby.

207
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:17,650
So he put it into her womb.

208
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:19,090
I'll call it in.

209
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:44,358
Alison's birthday. Shit.

210
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:47,339
Nice.

211
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:51,075
It's a very 1940s
detective agency.

212
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:54,650
Do we still smoke stogies and
have Scotch for breakfast?

213
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:57,359
What we're investigating,
it's very dark.

214
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:59,129
Fluorescents give me a migraine.

215
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:02,232
Look, I know that me coming
in here must be a bit of a shock.

216
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,228
Detective teams are a tight
knit at the best of times

217
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,411
but I do know this job.

218
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:09,282
So, I can help

219
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,713
if you let me.

220
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:12,886
I've gotta go.

221
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,579
It's my wife's birthday
and I'm late.

222
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:15,829
We'll do this tomorrow.

223
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:17,717
Nine a.m.

224
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,090
Uh-huh.

225
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:21,824
He takes it personal.

226
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,104
Well, he shouldn't.
I was assigned.

227
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,130
Not you.

228
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,549
The killings.

229
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,781
That won't last in here.

230
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:31,597
Plastic.

231
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,200
Thrives in all climates.

232
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:05,306
Happy birthday to me.

233
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:11,680
I'll take care of that.

234
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:24,607
I don't even like carnations.

235
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,349
I'm going to bed.

236
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,878
The previous commandment
prior to the Lanning was...

237
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:41,152
"Thou shall not lie".
This is a Catholic family.

238
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:44,550
Jessica and Steven,
both lawyers.

239
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:46,500
The Preceptor cut out
both of their tongues

240
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:48,462
with an electric turkey knife.

241
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:51,827
Let them bleed out in front
of their only son, Michael.

242
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,070
What'd he do with the tongues?

243
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:55,143
Put 'em in a blender,
force-fed 'em to the son

244
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,253
laced with bleach, of course.

245
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,401
Donut?

246
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,870
Now why would he feed
the tongues to the son?

247
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,330
He said they were feeding
lies to everyone,

248
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,330
so he fed their
lies to their son.

249
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:06,490
How you guys know all this?

250
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,819
He's quite the letter writer.

251
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,140
We have copies, obviously.

252
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,816
-I'll get you some.
-Speakin' of which...

253
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:13,222
this came from the M.E.'s
office this morning.

254
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,935
Got it out of Lanning's abdomen.

255
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:19,120
"The irony of this killing

256
00:22:19,182 --> 00:22:21,156
"is that when people
see what I've done,

257
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,345
"their reaction will be...

258
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:26,891
"'Oh, poor dog'
with no consideration for

259
00:22:26,977 --> 00:22:29,367
the vacuous vessel in which
I chose to store it".

260
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,168
Nice.

261
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:31,536
Forensics has been
over the letters?

262
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,031
Local and Langley.
Came up with nothing.

263
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,630
Letter was typed in a
old manual typewriter.

264
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:37,692
Common ink.

265
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:40,581
No prints, oils, residue,

266
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,978
glue, particulates. Nothin'.

267
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:45,720
The name Preceptor.
That's a masonic term.

268
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:47,117
Has that avenue
been checked out?

269
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,469
It's used by Freemasons,
but it's older than that.

270
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,141
A precept is a teacher...

271
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,715
responsible to uphold
law or tradition.

272
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,165
In this case, the
Ten Commandments.

273
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,725
-Shall I?
-Just one second.

274
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:00,049
How many victims are we
talking about in total now?

275
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,156
Fourteen.

276
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:03,334
-Two commandments left.
-"Thou shalt not steal".

277
00:23:03,368 --> 00:23:04,802
"Thou shalt not covet".

278
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,516
Can I ask you, what exactly
is your background?

279
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,645
Why are you on this case?

280
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,667
Of course. You can
ask me anything.

281
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,451
Can we go through the cases
in order, top to bottom?

282
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,940
You worked Forensics two years...

283
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,646
before you became a detective.

284
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:19,738
Did it take a lot
of detective work

285
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,441
to find out about
another detective?

286
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,343
Someone higher up think
we're screwing this up?

287
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:24,853
Someone higher up wants
this guy caught,

288
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:25,926
and it's as simple as that.

289
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,707
Okay. Let's do this.

290
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:32,750
Okay.

291
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:08,768
<i>"And upholds all things
by the word of his power,</i>

292
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,184
<i>"when he had made
purification of sins</i>

293
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:14,783
<i>"and he sat down at the right
hand of the Majesty on high."</i>

294
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,107
<i>"I am speaking in human terms</i>

295
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:18,870
<i>"because of the weakness
of your flesh.</i>

296
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:21,873
<i>"For just as you presented
your members as slaves...</i>

297
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:24,806
<i>"to impurity and to lawlessness,</i>

298
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,701
<i>resulting in further lawlessness,</i>

299
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,228
<i>"so now present your members
as slaves to righteousness,</i>

300
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:32,569
<i>resulting in sanctification."</i>

301
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,257
You all right?

302
00:24:54,812 --> 00:24:55,898
Let her go.

303
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:17,484
Who do you think they are?

304
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:33,405
Uniforms are going door to door
checking CCTVs.

305
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,689
Fuck me.

306
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:55,029
Eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth.

307
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:18,537
Tiffany Nardico, age 12,
Emily Cartwright, 13.

308
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:21,927
Susan Allison, 14,
and Nicole Panna, 15.

309
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:25,157
They all have records,
but it's just like petty theft.

310
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:28,771
You okay?

311
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,860
Yeah.

312
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:34,249
I just got off the
phone with Hodges.

313
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:36,265
The medical examiner.

314
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,094
The preliminary for the
hair, teeth, and eyes

315
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,729
were a match with the hands.

316
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:41,187
Same with the blood in the jar.

317
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,067
So it's just the four victims.

318
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:45,545
The killer injected some
kind of epoxy into the hands

319
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:46,833
to keep them into position.

320
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,500
-Anything else?
-Yes.

321
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:50,736
No coagulation
in the fingertips.

322
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,266
Shit.

323
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,681
What?

324
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:55,831
He cut their hands off while
they were still alive.

325
00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:57,318
Jesus.

326
00:26:58,453 --> 00:26:59,891
-Are those them?
-Yeah.

327
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:01,867
-What name is that?
-Nicole Panna.

328
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:04,749
Does that mean anything to you?

329
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,554
No, why? Should it?

330
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:07,922
Just a second.

331
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:13,289
Carl Watkins.

332
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:15,554
Who?

333
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,286
Local perp.

334
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:19,162
Flasher. Kiddie porn peddler.

335
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:20,185
We picked him up a
couple of times,

336
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,364
but he always pled out...

337
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:23,109
or made a deal informing.

338
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,229
So, what does he have
to do with this?

339
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:26,364
All of these girls went to
Chase Terrace Academy.

340
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:27,877
Terrace put a restraining
order against him

341
00:27:27,908 --> 00:27:29,361
after he was caught
a few times

342
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:31,884
loitering and jerking off
to the girls in gym class.

343
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:34,545
That's a real stretch, David.

344
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:36,764
Guess who also went to
Terrace a few years back?

345
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:37,986
Crystal Lanning.

346
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:39,596
Exactly.

347
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:40,737
Seriously?

348
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,940
Do we have an address on him?

349
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,598
He's not in.

350
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,237
That cocksucker owes
me two months' rent.

351
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:50,885
He hasn't been here
for a couple of days.

352
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,182
Think he'd be
hiding out inside?

353
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:54,910
Well, if he is, he's freezing
his ass off in the dark.

354
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,286
I cut his power yesterday.

355
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:00,789
Seriously?

356
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:02,212
No windows?

357
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,413
Honey, with what those
boys are doing in there,

358
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:07,374
no windows ain't a bad thing.

359
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:11,798
Shut the door when you leave.

360
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,979
"What an incredible smell
you've discovered."

361
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:23,544
This shouldn't take long.

362
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:31,356
This guy seems to have
quite the right arm.

363
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:34,662
Doesn't really seem like
the Preceptor type.

364
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:37,266
Speak of the devil.

365
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:50,921
Looks like it's typed on
an old manual typewriter.

366
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,395
-Let's get that back to the lab.
-Mm-hmm.

367
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,919
Put out an ATL on Watkins.

368
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,303
In the meantime,
let's hit the usual suspects.

369
00:28:57,818 --> 00:28:59,070
You go with David.

370
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,334
Anything?

371
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:12,671
Nope.

372
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,754
You done for the day?

373
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:16,253
Yeah.

374
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:18,984
I'm gonna swing by Watkin's
apartment on the way home.

375
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,009
What's up?

376
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:22,742
Somethin's been
buggin' me about it.

377
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:27,561
Give our regards to that
sweet-mouth landlady for me.

378
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:29,280
I'll give her your number.

379
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,465
Thanks for turning the power on.

380
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:54,643
Excuse me.
Detective Sean Carter.

381
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:07,902
Mr. Carter?

382
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:14,205
Mr. Carter. You're a man
of some interest to us.

383
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,532
-What do you want to know?
-Excuse me?

384
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,445
You obviously have questions.

385
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,900
Why would you say that?

386
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,429
'Cause if you wanted me
dead, I'd be dead already.

387
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:26,203
That's very true. What else?

388
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,388
If I had to guess,
I stumbled into a

389
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:33,060
painful, possibly fatal situation--

390
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:34,938
the agenda of which
you'll soon tell me.

391
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:40,841
What can you tell me
about Carl Watkins?

392
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,674
A man of impeccable
taste, apparently.

393
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:45,846
And what can you tell me
about the Preceptor?

394
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:48,486
I was about to ask you
the same question.

395
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:52,664
What are those?

396
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:58,150
Well, since you've been good
enough not to waste our time

397
00:31:58,175 --> 00:32:00,253
with the usual drudgery of

398
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:03,433
"Who are you" and
"Save me", etcetera,

399
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,258
perhaps a reward is in order.

400
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,534
Dear God.

401
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,409
Where am I?

402
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,473
You wanted to know about these?

403
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:23,956
They are... a linking
mechanism between

404
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:25,697
our world and yours.

405
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:28,687
They are judgment and redemption
to those who open them.

406
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:30,869
They are sensation...

407
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:33,815
rebirth... death...

408
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,049
love... hate...

409
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:38,372
all manner of emotions.

410
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,320
They are a conduit
to the unimaginable.

411
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:47,339
In a wooden box.

412
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:50,595
You'll be amazed what
they can do when opened.

413
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,860
What on Earth is this place?

414
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:54,217
It isn't.

415
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,104
So, now what?

416
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,963
This is the beginning
of a process.

417
00:33:01,182 --> 00:33:02,284
An interview.

418
00:33:02,362 --> 00:33:03,692
An audit of sorts.

419
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,417
And you want honest answers.

420
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:06,355
Absolutely.

421
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:08,077
So, then let's just
get on with it.

422
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,586
Tempus fugit, after all.

423
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,472
Tell me...

424
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,765
when was the first time
you hurt something?

425
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:18,270
Be honest, Mr. Carter.

426
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:21,954
The sooner you tell the truth,
the sooner you will be free.

427
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:24,061
Four.

428
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,789
We had a pet dog.

429
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:36,565
I hit it.

430
00:33:38,135 --> 00:33:39,286
Should I go on?

431
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,474
March 31st... 2004.

432
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,898
I was 25.

433
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:48,937
The bullet hit him in the throat.

434
00:33:49,687 --> 00:33:51,687
I saw a fist-sized chunk...

435
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,725
blown out the back of his neck.

436
00:33:55,882 --> 00:33:58,158
I stood over him
and watched him die.

437
00:33:58,297 --> 00:33:59,686
And after that?

438
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:01,952
Two kids.

439
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:03,643
Grenade.

440
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:07,188
It was the first time I'd ever
seen a body blown to pieces.

441
00:34:07,305 --> 00:34:09,122
Skin stripped from muscle.

442
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:12,280
Flesh stripped from bone.

443
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:16,696
You... were a man
protecting his country.

444
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:20,048
You were permitted
to carry out these acts.

445
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,743
But what were you
permitted to feel?

446
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:27,493
-What did you feel?
-What did I feel?

447
00:34:27,938 --> 00:34:29,569
How the hell was I
supposed to feel?

448
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:31,660
You have killed
a great many people.

449
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:33,491
I was doing my job.

450
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:34,848
"You will have purged
from yourselves

451
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,041
"the guilt of shedding
innocent blood.

452
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:40,139
For you have done what is right
in the eyes of the Lord."

453
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:42,408
Only God can judge me.

454
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:45,818
"And God will judge both the
righteous man and the wicked man."

455
00:34:45,843 --> 00:34:47,361
Ecclesiastes 3:17.

456
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:49,156
Deuteronomy 21:9.

457
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:49,875
Ha!

458
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:53,803
I... would like to
dig a little deeper.

459
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:55,427
What choice do I have?

460
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:57,763
None.

461
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:08,336
During my second tour,
our convoy hit--and I...

462
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:21,983
There is still more.

463
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,484
"It is a terrible,
ponderous chain

464
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:38,487
you are making, Scrooge".

465
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:41,608
Charles Dickens.

466
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,827
Now what?

467
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:46,274
Next you will meet the Assessor.

468
00:35:46,923 --> 00:35:48,017
And my...

469
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:50,470
what a meal he has
ahead of him.

470
00:36:58,773 --> 00:36:59,914
What have you done?

471
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:16,608
You will be taken to be cleaned.

472
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:18,319
And then to the Surgeon.

473
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:23,128
No, it can't be!

474
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,756
I hate this place.

475
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,473
The stench, the decor.

476
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:43,793
The seedy games and indulgences

477
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:46,293
we allow you to play as
part of the arrangement

478
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:48,286
-Why are you here?
-Let him go.

479
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,462
He has no business here.

480
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:51,532
I don't understand.

481
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:54,543
Well... just because
it falls into your web

482
00:37:54,577 --> 00:37:56,598
does not make it
prey for a spider.

483
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,603
Catch and release,
do you understand?

484
00:37:58,654 --> 00:37:59,835
What about the Assessor?

485
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:01,657
Clerical error, quite literally.

486
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,978
-I've never heard of this--
-I don't care.

487
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,668
The Jury never passed
their verdict.

488
00:38:05,746 --> 00:38:07,386
You let him go,
do you understand?

489
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,338
Not really, no.

490
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:10,849
Well, do you understand
who is in charge?

491
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:14,400
Just let him go.

492
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:18,885
Do not give me a reason
to come back here.

493
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:29,532
You must be cleaned...

494
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:32,969
on the inside, too.

495
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:15,084
No!

496
00:40:21,847 --> 00:40:23,682
Uh, a moment of your time.

497
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,624
A candidate...

498
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:28,347
I need your assistance,
with your...guidance.

499
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:29,473
Why?

500
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:31,724
His answers
choked the Assessor.

501
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:33,975
Froze the Jury and...

502
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:36,121
summoned Jophiel.

503
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:39,021
Innocent?

504
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,641
Where is he now?

505
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,040
I sent him to be cleaned.

506
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:03,409
He's gone!

507
00:41:03,414 --> 00:41:05,270
Escaped with one of the boxes.

508
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:06,956
The pages.

509
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:14,175
Take.

510
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:17,160
Eat this in remembrance
of my body.

511
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:21,839
You must go after him.

512
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:24,360
Bring him back.
You must dig deeper.

513
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:27,175
We must find out why
Jophiel wants him released.

514
00:41:30,736 --> 00:41:32,509
There's no need to go after him.

515
00:41:33,569 --> 00:41:35,149
He'll be back.

516
00:42:21,934 --> 00:42:23,389
It's 2:30 in the morning.

517
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:25,672
You got-You got any flashlight?

518
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,234
-Yeah, why?
-I'll drive.

519
00:42:29,148 --> 00:42:30,299
Why, what's up?

520
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:32,918
Huh?

521
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:34,403
What's going on?

522
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:51,670
You wanna call this in?

523
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:55,227
What are we doing here?

524
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,631
Hey.

525
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:00,062
What the fuck
are we doing here?

526
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:23,853
So?

527
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:27,702
Come on, man!

528
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:42,686
It's nice. Nice place.

529
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:44,657
You put an offer in yet?

530
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,586
-Or are you in escrow?
-Fuck.

531
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,446
Hey!

532
00:43:58,439 --> 00:43:59,611
What is going on?

533
00:44:00,094 --> 00:44:02,007
You drag my ass out here in
the middle of the fucking night

534
00:44:02,032 --> 00:44:03,471
with no explanation?

535
00:44:04,285 --> 00:44:06,204
You barely talk to me
anymore, man.

536
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:10,044
Alison is worried about you.

537
00:44:10,086 --> 00:44:11,601
Oh, you'd know that.

538
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:13,633
Man, we're all worried
about you, Sean.

539
00:44:14,072 --> 00:44:15,889
I'll drive you back to your car.

540
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,943
<i>They are a conduit
to the unimaginable.</i>

541
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:52,314
<i>Sensation, rebirth,
death, lust, hate.</i>

542
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:18,879
Hey, hey, hey...

543
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:19,601
It's just a dream.

544
00:46:19,984 --> 00:46:20,998
It's just a dream.
You're okay.

545
00:46:21,632 --> 00:46:22,351
It's okay.

546
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:23,853
Come here, come here.

547
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:24,767
Shh.

548
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:28,648
Shh. It's okay.

549
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,285
I don't know what's
going on anymore.

550
00:46:35,931 --> 00:46:39,282
This case... it's destroying you.

551
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:43,426
I can't get it out of my head.

552
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:44,403
Shh.

553
00:46:44,895 --> 00:46:46,059
Shh.

554
00:47:38,308 --> 00:47:39,308
Sean!

555
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:40,304
What?

556
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:42,332
What is going on?
What are you doing?

557
00:47:43,017 --> 00:47:43,844
What?

558
00:48:26,747 --> 00:48:28,142
Judgment and redemption

559
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,026
to those who open the box.

560
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:44,910
Thank you.

561
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,434
Almond milk.

562
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:52,999
Thanks.

563
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,344
So, what's on your mind?

564
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:01,684
Your brother?

565
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:03,999
I'm just curious.

566
00:49:04,747 --> 00:49:06,614
You've been here
for a couple of days.

567
00:49:07,396 --> 00:49:08,474
What do you see?

568
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:12,523
I see two people mired
in a pretty dark case.

569
00:49:12,934 --> 00:49:14,808
One of whom is
probably internalizing

570
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:16,087
a little bit too much of it.

571
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:20,599
Honestly, I don't know
that I would be any different.

572
00:49:21,612 --> 00:49:23,436
Yeah, he's not running right.

573
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,235
Have you talked to
somebody about that?

574
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:27,358
Not official, but I do
talk to his wife.

575
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:29,074
Alison.

576
00:49:29,573 --> 00:49:30,423
Yeah.

577
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:32,009
How'd you know that?

578
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,378
Did he ever suffer from any
PTSD when he came back?

579
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:37,526
Not that I know of.

580
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,128
But he's never really talked
about what went on over there.

581
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:41,944
Drinking, drugs?

582
00:49:42,745 --> 00:49:43,845
None of that?

583
00:49:46,408 --> 00:49:49,549
He drank for a little while
but he's sober now.

584
00:49:50,127 --> 00:49:51,985
Just lately he's been distant.

585
00:49:52,376 --> 00:49:54,576
I think maybe it's starting
to have an effect on him.

586
00:49:57,818 --> 00:49:58,849
I...

587
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:03,077
What?

588
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:07,554
Look, I was assigned
to this case for two reasons.

589
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:10,358
One of them is to expedite the
catching of the Preceptor...

590
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:11,296
and the other is because

591
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,907
there are some concerns
about Sean's behavior.

592
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,702
So I am here, first and foremost

593
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:18,499
to help you with the case
but also to evaluate.

594
00:50:18,524 --> 00:50:20,499
We've been working our
ass off in this case.

595
00:50:20,524 --> 00:50:21,913
And it's not about that.

596
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:26,170
This is genuine concern for
someone who might be in too deep.

597
00:50:31,702 --> 00:50:32,772
It's Alison.

598
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:34,608
Hey, you.

599
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:37,311
What?

600
00:50:39,142 --> 00:50:40,391
He is?

601
00:50:41,807 --> 00:50:43,221
Don't worry about it.

602
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,369
I'll come by and pick him up.
You take Sara to school.

603
00:50:46,862 --> 00:50:47,869
Okay.

604
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,285
His car broke down.
I have to go pick him up.

605
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,457
He didn't call you?

606
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,753
I gotta go.

607
00:51:15,086 --> 00:51:15,922
Hey.

608
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:17,446
Hey.

609
00:51:17,626 --> 00:51:18,626
Sean!

610
00:51:27,613 --> 00:51:30,027
I'll uh... I'll go take a shower.

611
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:31,684
Ah, wait a second, please.

612
00:51:36,649 --> 00:51:38,032
You gotta straighten up.

613
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:41,337
Just in case, Egerton has...

614
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,665
other motivations
for being with us.

615
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:44,803
Meaning what?

616
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:46,313
Think about it.

617
00:51:47,345 --> 00:51:49,376
How long have you
been drinking again?

618
00:51:49,915 --> 00:51:51,712
Alison and I got
in a bit of a fight.

619
00:51:51,743 --> 00:51:53,399
I had a few drinks,
caught up to me.

620
00:51:53,595 --> 00:51:54,771
I got this.

621
00:51:55,138 --> 00:51:56,395
Go get cleaned up.

622
00:51:58,614 --> 00:51:59,809
Sean...

623
00:52:02,817 --> 00:52:04,708
no one is judging you.

624
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:07,434
Like I told somebody else,

625
00:52:07,552 --> 00:52:08,985
only God can judge me.

626
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:11,865
God will judge both the righteous
man and the wicked man.

627
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:40,946
"It was the best of times,

628
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,425
it was the worst of times".

629
00:52:43,738 --> 00:52:45,605
If I had a relationship
like that...

630
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:21,918
Hello.

631
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:23,465
Hey.

632
00:53:42,447 --> 00:53:43,343
Take a look at this.

633
00:53:43,399 --> 00:53:45,547
This is the first letter
from the Preceptor.

634
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:46,875
Read here.

635
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:49,397
"There is no accountability.

636
00:53:49,446 --> 00:53:52,049
"I will bring back
the wrath of the Almighty.

637
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:54,677
"I will be the plague of retribution.

638
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:57,444
It will be the season of darkness
and winter of despair."

639
00:53:57,491 --> 00:53:58,405
And?

640
00:53:58,498 --> 00:54:00,623
And I just found this
at Sean's house.

641
00:54:00,928 --> 00:54:02,162
Dickens.

642
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,674
He didn't tell you about this?

643
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,791
He mentioned the book,
but he didn't mention this.

644
00:54:05,893 --> 00:54:07,013
Well, maybe he just
put it together.

645
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:07,986
Then why didn't he say anything?

646
00:54:08,064 --> 00:54:09,978
I don't know,
you should've asked him.

647
00:54:10,185 --> 00:54:11,064
Where is he?

648
00:54:11,174 --> 00:54:12,068
He's on his way.

649
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:14,146
I thought he had some
kind of car trouble?

650
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:16,318
He did not have car trouble.

651
00:54:16,677 --> 00:54:18,816
He was drunk
and I had to go help him.

652
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:20,460
You said he was sober.

653
00:54:20,562 --> 00:54:21,825
He was. He is.

654
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:22,731
David, what the
fuck is going on?

655
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:23,763
I don't know.

656
00:54:24,268 --> 00:54:25,480
That's why I came to you.

657
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,151
I'm gonna have to talk to him.

658
00:54:30,104 --> 00:54:31,336
Talk to who?

659
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,440
You--what happened to your face?

660
00:54:33,627 --> 00:54:34,690
About what?

661
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:39,412
Hello.

662
00:54:39,717 --> 00:54:41,067
Yes, this is Carter.

663
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:42,675
Yes, that Carter.

664
00:54:43,539 --> 00:54:44,539
He did.

665
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,638
What exactly?

666
00:54:48,338 --> 00:54:49,338
Phone?

667
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,389
Where?

668
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,140
We'll be there.

669
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:56,559
Medical examiner.

670
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:58,861
Found Crystal Lanning's
cell phone...

671
00:54:59,514 --> 00:55:00,667
wedged down her throat.

672
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,717
-You're kidding me.
-He wants us there.

673
00:55:03,685 --> 00:55:04,623
Okay.

674
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:05,716
You and I go.

675
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:08,182
David stays here and goes
through some of that evidence.

676
00:55:08,341 --> 00:55:10,200
-Okay.
-Okay.

677
00:55:19,979 --> 00:55:20,979
Shit.

678
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,521
Forgot my phone.

679
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:24,040
Just give me a sec.

680
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:33,168
Forgot you cell phone?

681
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:36,457
I need you to do me a favor.

682
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,326
Take a quick look around

683
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:40,066
See if you find
anything unusual.

684
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:42,659
I'm not investigating
my brother.

685
00:55:42,683 --> 00:55:43,883
I'm not asking you to.

686
00:55:44,492 --> 00:55:45,628
Take a look.

687
00:55:45,664 --> 00:55:46,867
For his sake.

688
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,624
-Okay.
-Okay.

689
00:55:59,132 --> 00:56:01,059
Well, it seems to be
running okay now.

690
00:56:01,193 --> 00:56:02,193
What?

691
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:03,271
The car.

692
00:56:03,296 --> 00:56:05,642
David said you had some
car trouble this morning.

693
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:06,985
Marriage trouble.

694
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:10,386
Well, at least you're honest.

695
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:17,530
Can I ask you something?

696
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,311
Honestly?

697
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,680
Do you think you're
too close to this case?

698
00:56:21,944 --> 00:56:23,772
Probably, but it's my work.

699
00:56:23,991 --> 00:56:26,041
Yeah, but if it's tearing
your world apart...

700
00:56:26,075 --> 00:56:27,082
What can I do?

701
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:28,457
There's only one
commandment left.

702
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:30,385
Gotta finish it all the way
to the end, right?

703
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:31,278
I get that.

704
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,872
And I think it's
really admirable, but...

705
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:35,617
this is not a tour of duty.

706
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:36,895
It is for me.

707
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:44,760
Well, I was reading through
the notes from the Preceptor.

708
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:48,558
I notice that a lot of the
turn of phrase is very poetic.

709
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:50,339
Almost reads like literature.

710
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,347
You know, David mentioned
you read a lot, so

711
00:56:53,402 --> 00:56:56,578
I thought I'd ask if anything
struck a chord with you.

712
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:59,001
Not really.

713
00:57:00,746 --> 00:57:02,699
I mean, there were a
couple of lines...

714
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:05,542
lifted from <i>A Tale of
Two Cities</i> by Dickens, but

715
00:57:05,753 --> 00:57:07,430
nothing else comes to mind.

716
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:09,584
Did you bring that up
in the investigation?

717
00:57:10,441 --> 00:57:11,644
It didn't seem relevant.

718
00:57:12,113 --> 00:57:14,730
After all, it is the most
popular book on the planet.

719
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,151
Yeah.

720
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:21,902
I guess it is.

721
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:25,261
Hodges.

722
00:57:27,972 --> 00:57:29,160
-Hodges.
-Hey.

723
00:57:30,772 --> 00:57:31,576
So.

724
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:33,740
Let's see...

725
00:57:34,847 --> 00:57:35,724
Yeah.

726
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,520
I thought you said you
found a cell phone.

727
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,082
Yeah, we did, in her throat.

728
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:44,044
We found that
in her mouth first.

729
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,089
Silver?

730
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:46,801
Born with a silver
spoon in her mouth.

731
00:57:46,835 --> 00:57:48,126
She certainly died that way.

732
00:57:48,755 --> 00:57:51,005
We found this in her esophagus.

733
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:53,200
Way down in there.

734
00:57:54,489 --> 00:57:55,598
Damn shame.

735
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,669
Yeah, she was only 21.

736
00:57:57,793 --> 00:57:59,160
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

737
00:57:59,848 --> 00:58:01,508
I mean that's an iPhone 7.

738
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:02,668
I still got a 4.

739
00:58:04,262 --> 00:58:06,168
Thanks, Hodges.
Thanks for the information.

740
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,462
It still works.

741
00:58:08,871 --> 00:58:10,348
-What?
-The phone.

742
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,819
Yeah, one of the kids
here has the same model,

743
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:14,223
so we managed to
power the thing up.

744
00:58:14,248 --> 00:58:16,749
And we did, turns out she
was using a GPS app.

745
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:18,514
The location on it
wasn't her apartment?

746
00:58:18,584 --> 00:58:19,796
No, we checked.

747
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:22,255
She wasn't killed at
the apartment, either.

748
00:58:22,814 --> 00:58:24,645
What he did took time and uh...

749
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:26,681
would've been quite the mess.

750
00:58:26,993 --> 00:58:28,571
Yeah, especially with the dog.

751
00:58:28,774 --> 00:58:32,578
No, he took her somewhere
alive, prepped her, killed her.

752
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:35,868
Luckily, if you can say that,
her phone died with her.

753
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:37,735
So it stored her last location.

754
00:58:38,336 --> 00:58:40,054
Serial killer caught
by a smartphone.

755
00:58:40,078 --> 00:58:41,602
Do you have the address?

756
00:58:42,765 --> 00:58:44,531
You know, I haven't seen
you around here before.

757
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,529
Yeah, I was just
assigned to the case.

758
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:48,136
Single?

759
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:49,497
You're kidding, right?

760
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:04,878
I'll call it in.

761
00:59:05,895 --> 00:59:07,466
Yeah, this is
Detective Sean Carter.

762
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:09,991
We're on the scene of a
possibly compromised location.

763
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:11,690
Requesting uniform backup.

764
00:59:11,973 --> 00:59:15,553
Address is 12437 Gladstone.

765
00:59:15,687 --> 00:59:18,080
It looks like a fisherman's
warehouse of some kind.

766
00:59:19,562 --> 00:59:20,884
Okay, copy that.

767
00:59:21,718 --> 00:59:23,429
I think this is
pretty locked up.

768
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,678
Yeah.

769
00:59:27,037 --> 00:59:27,901
I guess we'll be waiting.

770
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,063
I don't know, I hear a
struggle of some kind,

771
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:31,598
destruction of evidence.

772
00:59:33,253 --> 00:59:34,057
I don't hear anything.

773
00:59:34,082 --> 00:59:36,218
Well, if you did, we wouldn't
have to wait for a warrant.

774
00:59:36,242 --> 00:59:38,128
-You wanna catch this guy, right?
-Of course, I do.

775
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:39,542
Well, then we hear a struggle.

776
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:22,642
Over here.

777
01:01:13,262 --> 01:01:14,423
Look at this.

778
01:01:22,324 --> 01:01:23,466
It's him.

779
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:00,471
Holy shit!

780
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:53,055
Drop it.

781
01:02:56,614 --> 01:02:57,625
Fuck!

782
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:03,937
Backup's on the way.

783
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:04,951
No, they're not.

784
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:06,960
But someone is.

785
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:09,769
Now move to the fucking
center of the room.

786
01:03:15,514 --> 01:03:16,841
How did you find out?

787
01:03:17,985 --> 01:03:19,012
You told me.

788
01:03:26,117 --> 01:03:28,819
What was it you said?
"Only God can judge me".

789
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:31,101
"God will judge the righteous".

790
01:03:33,172 --> 01:03:34,976
"God will judge both
the righteous man...

791
01:03:35,057 --> 01:03:36,591
"and the wicked man".

792
01:03:40,724 --> 01:03:43,432
"Ecclesiastes is one of
24 books of the Tanakh...

793
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:44,766
"or Hebrew Bible".

794
01:03:44,936 --> 01:03:47,268
"The title Ecclesiastes is
a Latin transliteration

795
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:49,084
"of the Greek translation...

796
01:03:49,169 --> 01:03:51,255
"traditionally translated as 'Teacher'...

797
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:52,459
"or 'Preacher'...

798
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,404
"or 'Preceptor'".

799
01:03:57,023 --> 01:03:58,250
Preceptor.

800
01:04:00,315 --> 01:04:01,315
Shit!

801
01:04:02,709 --> 01:04:03,709
Shit!

802
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:07,251
When I didn't hear
back from Egerton...

803
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:09,342
I called Hodges
to get the address.

804
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,858
Quite the detective.

805
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:13,681
Why are you doing this?

806
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:15,048
Like I've always told you,

807
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:17,339
you should read more,
starting with the Bible.

808
01:04:17,373 --> 01:04:18,373
Sean?

809
01:04:18,837 --> 01:04:21,098
You wouldn't call backup
on you own brother.

810
01:04:21,132 --> 01:04:22,281
Not until you knew for sure.

811
01:04:22,315 --> 01:04:24,235
So I called someone else.

812
01:04:25,524 --> 01:04:26,852
In here.

813
01:04:29,147 --> 01:04:30,694
I came as fast as I could.

814
01:04:31,852 --> 01:04:32,852
Shit!

815
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:36,319
Sean, what are you doing?

816
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:39,813
Sean?

817
01:04:41,092 --> 01:04:42,811
What is this?
What's going on?

818
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:44,234
Come on in, sweetheart.

819
01:04:44,268 --> 01:04:46,123
Come stand next to
my dear brother.

820
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:49,647
No, no, no, no.

821
01:04:50,037 --> 01:04:52,069
Go stand next to David.

822
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:58,037
I didn't say touch her!

823
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:04,239
I have so much more planned
for the two of you!

824
01:05:05,036 --> 01:05:08,186
That Lanning bitch's cell phone
fucked things up!

825
01:05:08,268 --> 01:05:09,740
I don't understand.

826
01:05:10,614 --> 01:05:11,685
You don't?

827
01:05:12,437 --> 01:05:13,525
Look around.

828
01:05:13,906 --> 01:05:14,924
Look at what I've done.

829
01:05:14,932 --> 01:05:19,041
This is the love of God,
that we keep his commandments.

830
01:05:19,072 --> 01:05:22,074
And his commandments
are not burdensome.

831
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:23,502
Where is Egerton?

832
01:05:27,077 --> 01:05:28,093
Oh!

833
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:31,085
-Jesus Christ!
-Oh!

834
01:05:35,361 --> 01:05:36,378
Sean, no, no.

835
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:37,998
Wait, wait.
We... We...

836
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:48,084
This whore cheated on me
with some guy she met online...

837
01:05:48,741 --> 01:05:51,796
two weeks after I left
for my first tour.

838
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:53,031
I'm sorry.

839
01:05:53,147 --> 01:05:55,974
Thou shall not covet
another man's wife.

840
01:05:58,343 --> 01:05:59,538
So I cut his eyelids off

841
01:05:59,563 --> 01:06:01,679
and burned him alive
in his own car.

842
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:06,444
I wasn't surprised with her.

843
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,101
But I expected more of you.

844
01:06:09,446 --> 01:06:10,221
Sean, I'm...

845
01:06:10,388 --> 01:06:14,822
What a plague of
smartphone junkies.

846
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:20,005
I... loathe the modern world.

847
01:06:20,022 --> 01:06:22,389
I loathe the populace.

848
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:26,272
If I had the means and ways,
I would incinerate them all.

849
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:29,848
Rain down fire and sulfur.

850
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,161
Now.

851
01:06:34,395 --> 01:06:37,375
I want you to sit down
in front of each other.

852
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:40,098
Just do it!

853
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:42,682
What are you gonna do?

854
01:06:49,229 --> 01:06:50,372
Open that.

855
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,149
What?

856
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:53,533
What the fuck is this?

857
01:06:53,732 --> 01:06:54,817
Open it, both of you.

858
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:55,907
Now. Together.

859
01:07:09,976 --> 01:07:10,905
What?

860
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,099
What is this?
What's happening?

861
01:07:24,765 --> 01:07:25,991
Judgment.

862
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:36,469
I knew you would find
your way here eventually.

863
01:07:43,578 --> 01:07:45,007
After all...

864
01:07:49,334 --> 01:07:51,753
evil seeks evil.

865
01:07:56,316 --> 01:07:58,241
I knew someone
would come for me.

866
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,941
So I thought I'd save you
the time and offer you a deal.

867
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,219
There is no deal to be made.

868
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:07,026
Them for me.

869
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:08,508
Adulterers.

870
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:09,697
They open the box.

871
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,726
And they will be
dealt with accordingly.

872
01:08:12,476 --> 01:08:15,415
It is a separate faction
who has want of you

873
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:17,459
and there is no
bargaining to be done.

874
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:19,591
Ah, Mr. Carter.

875
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:21,237
So good to see you again.

876
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:22,802
And you brought friends.

877
01:08:22,887 --> 01:08:24,739
I brought them to trade for me.

878
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:27,011
That is not how it works.

879
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,791
I don't want to go
back in that room.

880
01:08:37,925 --> 01:08:39,581
Mr. Carter, please.

881
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:41,894
That won't work for you now.

882
01:08:42,992 --> 01:08:44,121
Mr. Carter, please.

883
01:08:56,651 --> 01:08:59,339
You have been found
guilty by the Jury.

884
01:09:00,147 --> 01:09:02,381
You will be taken to be cleaned.

885
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:03,842
Again.

886
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:05,938
And then to the Surgeon.

887
01:09:05,965 --> 01:09:07,178
Not me!

888
01:09:09,991 --> 01:09:13,061
The pages of your
audit was so rancid,

889
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,155
this clear essence of your guilt,

890
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:17,972
they made even the
Assessor choke.

891
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,823
When the Surgeon and the
Butcher are finished with you,

892
01:09:21,848 --> 01:09:25,796
you will be reborn
in an eternity of agony.

893
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,339
What the fuck is going on?

894
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:28,388
Silence!

895
01:09:28,448 --> 01:09:31,401
Your pitiful adultery
is beneath me.

896
01:09:31,426 --> 01:09:35,683
Bow your head to the catalog
of filth you brother has created.

897
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,259
Amateurs.

898
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:07,845
But still we will afford
them an experience

899
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:10,106
beyond the limits
in your name.

900
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:13,328
Get away from him.

901
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:25,337
Ah, Jophiel. Eden's doorman.

902
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:27,532
Once upon a time.

903
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,037
And then, what was it?

904
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:32,118
Watching over the ark builders'
incestuous offspring.

905
01:10:32,157 --> 01:10:33,361
And now?

906
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,456
Monitoring this
basement's misfits.

907
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,127
He was found guilty.

908
01:10:38,174 --> 01:10:39,534
Let him go.

909
01:10:39,681 --> 01:10:42,385
There are matters at play here
that are part of a bigger plan

910
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:44,104
and he is a part of it.

911
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:47,248
You want him out
there on Earth...

912
01:10:47,889 --> 01:10:50,676
or rather <i>he</i> wants
him out there.

913
01:10:50,865 --> 01:10:52,983
He wants his flock
afraid of the wolf

914
01:10:53,017 --> 01:10:54,918
so that they look
toward the light.

915
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:57,474
You're not as foolish
as you look.

916
01:10:58,005 --> 01:10:59,747
But what about the
things he has done,

917
01:10:59,774 --> 01:11:01,598
the-the innocents he has killed?

918
01:11:01,635 --> 01:11:03,721
Acceptable losses.

919
01:11:04,882 --> 01:11:07,600
Good cannot exist without evil.

920
01:11:07,903 --> 01:11:09,309
When we discovered long ago

921
01:11:09,341 --> 01:11:11,692
that in order to
control the evil,

922
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:14,115
we had to be the ones
implementing it.

923
01:11:14,162 --> 01:11:16,548
Sin ordained by Heaven.

924
01:11:20,505 --> 01:11:22,262
Send him back.

925
01:11:26,096 --> 01:11:28,563
Continue your work,
Preceptor.

926
01:11:30,102 --> 01:11:32,196
With our blessing.

927
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:37,938
And the Lord saw that the sin
of man was great on the earth,

928
01:11:38,847 --> 01:11:42,026
and that all the thoughts
of his heart were evil.

929
01:11:42,627 --> 01:11:44,511
There is process...

930
01:11:44,686 --> 01:11:45,985
order to what we do.

931
01:11:46,019 --> 01:11:48,235
Send him back!

932
01:11:48,269 --> 01:11:49,318
Or?

933
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:53,033
There'll be hell to pay.

934
01:11:53,987 --> 01:11:56,336
Hell. To pay.

935
01:11:57,118 --> 01:11:58,791
Don't test me.

936
01:12:03,885 --> 01:12:05,143
Very well.

937
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:13,429
Now get me the fuck out of here.

938
01:12:14,002 --> 01:12:15,193
I've been forgiven.

939
01:12:15,227 --> 01:12:16,754
Not forgiven.

940
01:12:17,617 --> 01:12:18,539
What?

941
01:12:18,564 --> 01:12:21,361
You're a murderer.
A twisted sadist.

942
01:12:21,395 --> 01:12:23,464
For now, your actions
work in our favor.

943
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:26,597
But there will be judgment
for you eventually.

944
01:12:26,894 --> 01:12:29,294
And we will be waiting.

945
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:30,713
Fuck you!

946
01:12:34,744 --> 01:12:36,190
Send him back.

947
01:12:36,893 --> 01:12:38,305
With pleasure.

948
01:12:46,604 --> 01:12:47,731
I'm back.

949
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:00,642
"It is a far, far--"

950
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:17,939
We have an officer down
at 12437 Gladstone.

951
01:13:18,273 --> 01:13:19,910
Send assistance.

952
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:21,127
This is Egerton.

953
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:23,863
We have the Preceptor.

954
01:13:24,895 --> 01:13:27,183
Get me a fucking ambulance.

955
01:13:27,843 --> 01:13:30,238
You knew that would happen.

956
01:13:31,152 --> 01:13:33,605
You know nothing
of human behavior.

957
01:13:34,867 --> 01:13:36,941
There will be retaliation.

958
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:39,538
You will suffer.

959
01:13:41,382 --> 01:13:42,656
Suffer?

960
01:13:44,869 --> 01:13:45,947
Me?

961
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,463
How dare you use such a word.

962
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:55,674
You know nothing of suffering.

963
01:13:55,943 --> 01:13:57,991
I welcome its warm embrace.

964
01:13:58,031 --> 01:14:01,209
I exist only
to share its meaning.

965
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:05,441
Sin and suffering
are my dominion.

966
01:14:05,839 --> 01:14:08,026
Perhaps it's time
you learned a little

967
01:14:08,136 --> 01:14:10,351
of the matters
you seek to manage.

968
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:17,449
What are you doing?

969
01:14:17,683 --> 01:14:19,845
Do you know who I am?

970
01:14:20,821 --> 01:14:22,514
I care not.

971
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,673
Irony.

972
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:54,635
Are you the way?

973
01:14:58,381 --> 01:15:00,609
Do your worst.

974
01:15:01,077 --> 01:15:05,487
You forget my first
task for Him.

975
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:08,803
That my order's already
been sanctioned.

976
01:15:09,549 --> 01:15:10,851
Look at me.

977
01:15:11,835 --> 01:15:13,558
I'm already in Hell.

978
01:15:14,084 --> 01:15:16,439
Forged in agony and pain.

979
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,637
I welcome an
eternity of anguish.

980
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:22,637
See you, Pinhead...

981
01:15:37,062 --> 01:15:39,421
Here endeth the lesson.

982
01:15:40,562 --> 01:15:43,038
Jesus wept!

983
01:16:03,065 --> 01:16:05,230
Probably should not
have done that.

984
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:07,700
I have nothing to fear.

985
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:09,405
Did you forget?

986
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:12,490
She is the angel who banished
them from the Garden of Eden.

987
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:16,467
Perhaps there is a torture
we cannot endure.

988
01:16:17,102 --> 01:16:18,442
Banishment.

989
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:25,689
Banishment.

990
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:27,722
Exile.

991
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:29,989
Back to the mortal world.

992
01:16:31,455 --> 01:16:32,533
Banishment.

993
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:43,591
The sweet suffering.

994
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:45,903
