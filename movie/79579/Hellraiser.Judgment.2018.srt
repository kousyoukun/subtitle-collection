00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,393
[Pinhead] Obsolete.

2
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:22,231
Irrelevant in an age when
desire has become amplified.

3
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,943
But where lust can be sated
electronically.

4
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,446
We need something more
than just a wooden box.

5
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,656
[The Auditor]
There is a mechanism.

6
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,200
The house is ready.
We can adapt.

7
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,744
[Pinhead] Technology
may have advanced,

8
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:37,455
but sin remains unchanged.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,082
Pure. Greed.

10
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,252
Lust. Lies. Betrayal.

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,338
- This new millennium
hurtles forward.

12
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:47,631
Faith is lost.

13
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:51,427
Mankind have become
a vacuum without morality.

14
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,889
So many souls seeking
new and darker experiences.

15
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:59,018
Degradation upon degradation,
sin after sin.

16
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:03,189
- So then those are the souls
we shall seek out first.

Ah, Mr. Watkins.

So good of you to come.

We have such sights

Please, step inside.

[The Auditor] Mr. Watkins.

[Watkins]
What the fuck is going on?

00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,750
What the fuck are you?

What are you doing to me?

36
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,045
[The Auditor] Asshole!
All valid questions.

37

What the fuck is going on?

38
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,215
- Mr. Watkins, please.

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,009
Please assess your situation.

40
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,927
Look at your environment.

41
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,346
For now,
you are merely captive.

42
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,015
Sitting, tied to a chair.

43
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,434
If we wanted you killed,
then you would be.

44
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,936
We have simply
invited you here to talk.

45
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,606
To hear your thoughts
and desires.

46
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,983
Furthermore, if they're
as interesting and illuminating

47
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,151
as I believe them to be,

48
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,737
then your reward will be
beyond your belief.

49
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,405
- A reward?

50
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,656
- A reward tailored for a man

51
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,825
of your particular
tastes and desires.

52
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,536
- You know about me?

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,705
You know the things I've done?

54
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,749
- It is that resume of yours
that led us to you

55
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,584
and in turn you to us.

56
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,543
- Who are you?

57
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,421
- Yes.
Perhaps a little illumination.

58

Please, try not to be
too alarmed.

59
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,557

begin your interview.

So many people for you to see,
so let's just dive in, shall we?

- August 18, 2001,

00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,970
you lured little
Courtney Rettison to your car.

69
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,304
Why?

70
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,058
- I--I...how do you know?
- Please.

71
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,310
Let's save ourselves the time

72
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,895
and you the considerable pain

73
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,147
by answering the questions
honestly.

74
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,357
Clearly this is a place

75
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,402
where the rules of your world
do not apply.

76
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,487
And obviously,
I'm a man for whom

77
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,573
pain is nothing more
than a common currency.

79
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:49,832

81
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,006
I-I'd seen her at the, uh,
the playground before.

82
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,720
I couldn't help myself.

83
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,013
- [whispers] I understand.

84
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,597
- I was just trying to help.

85
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:06,974
- Yes, yes.

86
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,022
- She had blonde hair.

87
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:16,483
Long, and...
it was in a ponytail.

88
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,864
I've never seen so much blood
from a little creature.

89

90
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,168
- My, my. Quite the busy bee
we've been, Mr. Watkins.

91
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,377
- What about my reward?

92
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,212
- First of all, you will meet
with the assessor.

93
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,630
He will look over your pages,

94
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,758
pass on his findings
to the jury,

95
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,384
and we'll go from there.

96
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,553
The assessor
will be with you shortly.

00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,015
[yelling]
What?

104
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,570
- [yelling] Serves you right,
you sick fuck!

105
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,221
- Ladies, your verdict.

106
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,643
- [in unison]
Guilty.

107
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,856
[The Auditor]
The jury have deliberated,

108
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,525
and a guilty verdict
has been given.

109

[Watkins] What?

110
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,902
- You'll be taken from here
to be cleaned

111
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:47,986
and then to the Surgeon.

112
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,655
- But what about my reward?

113
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,407
Your note said you understood.

114
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,909
It said you were a friend.

115
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,829
- I do understand.
This is your reward.

116
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,792

deserving of, my friend.

Please help me, please.

Ah, no. Please!

00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,505
Help! What the fuck
are you doing to me? Stop!

128
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,011
[lady] You must be clean
on the inside, too.

129
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,976
[Watkins] Help!

It's just this piece of shit!

Josh?

144
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,508
You in my apartment again?

145
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:48,138
I told you that you need to
give me my key back.

146
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:52,934
Okay. This late-night
bootie call shit is over!

147
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:58,398
Although I could
probably go for a quickie...

148
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,234
for old times' sake.

149
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,906
Jo-s-s-h.

150
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,996
Okay.
I'm drying up real fast here.

151
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,416
This weirdo-in-the-dark thing
is only a turn-on

152
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,628
for like a few minutes.

153
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,212
And...and where's my dog?

154
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,214
Baby?

155
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,634
Fuck this!

[flips light switch]

Seriously? What the fuck
have you done with the lights?

00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,236
[coughing]

159
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,113
What do you want?

160
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,324
- [whispers]
To make a lesson out of you.

[sirens wailing]

162

What'd you do last night?

164
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,972
Wonderful. Yeah.

165
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,432
I had a great time last night.
Thank you for asking.

You can take a left

Building super
found her this afternoon.

169
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,655
- I went out with a girl
called Crystal.

170
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,573
- It speaks!

171
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,700
What was that like?

172
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,827
- Like <i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

173
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:34,995
- A what?

174
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,788
- Charles Dickens.

175
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,331
- Right.

176
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,125
Like anyone reads
that shit anymore.

177
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,877
- It's the most popular
fictional book on the planet.

178
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,296
- So why is this Crystal chick
like the book?

179
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,675
- Read it.

180
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,886
We're here.

181
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,263
- Good.

182
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,516
[lady] Worship this little guy.

183
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,018
[David] The place has
been cleared, locked down.

184
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,060
Everyone's been told
to hold back

185
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,855
until we make our pass
in case it's him.

186
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,606
[door opens and closes]

187
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,608
<i>[lady] I worship
this little guy.</i>

188
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,193
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

189
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,070
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

190
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,573
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

191
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,241
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

192
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,326
<i>I worship this little--</i>
- Nice.

193
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,203
<i>[lady] I worship
this little guy.</i>

194
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,622
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

195
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,666
<i>I worship
this little guy.</i>

196
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,760
- It's him.

197
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,388
It's definitely him.

198
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,723
- You think?

199
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,649
- Doesn't this seem a bit basic
for the Preceptor?

200
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,068
- Who the fuck are you?

201
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,027
What are you doing
creeping around

202
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,445
a murder scene
at nighttime?

203
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,613
You want to end up dead?

204
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,406
- Detectives Carter and Carter.

205
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,618
Brothers in arms...
literally.

206
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,161
Detective Egerton.

207
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,163
I've been assigned
to this case with you.

208
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,248
- You got her?
- I got her.

209
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,214
- Detective Christine Egerton.

210
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,093
- Do you mind?

211
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,135
- Why are you here?

212
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,804
Who thinks we need
help with this?

213
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,138
- Like I was saying,

214
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,433
isn't this just a bit basic
for the Preceptor?

215
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,435
I mean,
I was under the impression

216
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,022
that he liked to shock,
appall, teach.

217
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,690
[Sean] And that?

218
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:28,775
"I am a jealous God.

219
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,527
Thou shalt have
no others unto me"?

220
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,986
It's one of the remaining
commandments,

221
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,321
and it's part of his MO.

222
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,240
[Christine] I think
that it's just a stunt.

223
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,409
What was that?
- Jesus Christ!

224
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,457
What the fuck is that?

225
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,628
- Has anyone seen
the dog in the video?

226
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,010
- Fuck!

227
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,354
- [dog cries out]
- It's okay.

228
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,730
- It's okay.

229
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,691
[dog whining]

230
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,860
[Christine] Baby.

231
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,362
The dog was her baby.

232
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,740
- So he put it into her womb.

233
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,450
- I'll call it in.

234
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,718
[phone vibrates]

235
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,184
- Alison's birthday. Shit!

236
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,312
- Nice.

237
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,858
It's uh, very 1940s
detective agency.

238
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,402
Do we still smoke stogies
and have scotch for breakfast?

239
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,363
- What we're investigating
is very dark.

240
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,948
Fluorescents
give me a migraine.

241
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,327
- Look, I know that me coming
here must be a bit of a shock.

242
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,163
Detective teams are tight-knit
at the best of times,

243
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,582
but I do know this job.

244
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,584
So, I can help

245
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,586
if you let me.

246
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,629
- I've gotta go.

247
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,672
It's my wife's birthday
and I'm late.

248
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,466
We'll do this tomorrow.

249
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,592
- 9 a.m.

250
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,177
- Uh-huh.

251
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,055
- He takes it personal.

252
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,932
- Well, he shouldn't.
I was assigned.

253
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,099
- Not you.

254
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,351
The killings.

255
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,811
That won't last in here.

256
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,606
- Plastic.

257
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,524
Thrives in all climates.

258
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,515
- Happy birthday to me.

259
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,183
- Oh...

260
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,228
- [sniffling]

261
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,729
- I'll take care of that.

262
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:16,943
- [sniffling]

263
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,742
I don't even like carnations.

264
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,455
I'm going to bed.

265
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,547
- The previous commandment
prior to Lanning was

266
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:41,050
"Thou shall not lie."
This is a Catholic family.

267
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,595
Jessica and Steven
were both lawyers.

268
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,180
The Preceptor cut out
both of their tongues

269
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,558
with an electric turkey knife.

270
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:51,561
Let them bleed out in front of
their own son, Michael.

271
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,812
- What did he do
with the tongues?

272
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,856
- He put them in a blender
and force-fed them to the son,

273
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,108
laced with bleach, of course.

274
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,484
Donut?

275
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,653
- Now why would he feed
the tongues to the son?

276
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,239
- He said they were
feeding lies to everyone,

277
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,074
so he fed their lies
to their son.

278
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,367
- How do you guys know all this?

279
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,452
- He's quite the letter writer.

280
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,828
We have copies obviously.

281
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,663
I'll get you some.
- Speaking of which...

282
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,875
this came from the ME's office
this morning.

283
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,877
Got it out of Lanning's abdomen.

284
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,713
- "The irony of this killing

285
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,798
"is that when people see
what I've done,

286
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,552
"their reaction will be,
'Oh, poor dog,'

287
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,305
"with no consideration
for the vacuous vessel

288
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,098
in which I chose to store it."

289
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,224
- Nice.

290
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,225
- Forensics has been
over the letters?

291
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,187
- Local and Langley.
Came out with nothing.

292
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,564
Letter was typed
on an old manual typewriter.

293
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,565
Common ink.

294
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,737
No prints, oils, residue,
glue, particulates. Nothin'.

295
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,406
- The name Preceptor.
That's a Masonic term.

296
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,741
Has that avenue
been checked out?

297
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,202
- It's used by freemasons,
but it's older than that.

298
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,245
A precept is a teacher

299
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,373
responsible to uphold
law or tradition.

300
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,250
In this case,
the Ten Commandments.

301
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,585
- Shall I?
- Just one second.

302
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,879
How many victims are we
talking about in total now?

303
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:00,838
- Fourteen.

304
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,924
- Two commandments left.
- "Thou shall not steal."

305
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,592
"Thou shall not covet."

306
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,220
- Can I ask you what exactly
is your background?

307
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:08,388
Why are you on this case?

308
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,890
- Of course.
You can ask me anything.

309
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,184
Can we go through the cases in
order, top to bottom?

310
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:18,272
- You worked forensics two years
before you became a detective.

311
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,399
- Did it take
a lot of detective work

312
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:20,983
to find out about
another detective?

313
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,860
- Someone higher up think
we're screwin' this up?

314
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,445
- Someone higher up
wants this guy caught,

315
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,697
and it's as simple as that.

316
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,908
[phone rings]

317
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,535
- Okay. Let's do this.

318
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:32,870
- Okay.

319
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,860
[strident music playing]

320
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,736
[screams]

321
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,155
[man] At a point,
we're all [indistinct]

322
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,823
by the word
of his power,

323
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,784
when he has made purification
his [indistinct]

324
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,204
at the right hand
of His Majesty on high.

325
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,039
I am speaking in human terms

326
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,875
because of the weakness
of your flesh,

327
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,377
- for just as you presented...
- [saw thuds]

328
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,338
- ...blazed with the impurities
and true lawlessness

329
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,591
resulting in
further lawlessness,

330
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:30,178
so now present your members
as blazed to righteousness,

331
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,847
resulting in sanctification.

332
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,891
[bird cawing]

333
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,527
- You all right?

334
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,120
- Let her go.

335
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,517
- Who do you think they are?

336
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,241
- Uniforms are going
door to door to check the CCTVs.

337
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,675
[Sean] Fuck me!

338
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:55,179
- Eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth.

339
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:18,869
- Tiffany Nardico, age 12,
Emily Cartwright, 13.

340
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:22,081
Susan Allison, 14,
and Nicole Panna, 15.

341
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,042
They all have records,
but it's just like petty theft.

342
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:28,462
- Okay?

343
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,880
- Yeah.

344
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,884
- I just got off the phone
with Hodges.

345
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,554
The medical examiner.

346
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,763
Preliminaries for the hair,
teeth, and eyes

347
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,473
are a match with the hands.

348
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,225
Same with the blood in the jar.

349
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,060
So it's just the four victims.

350
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,229
The killer injected some
kind of epoxy into the hands

351
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,522
to keep them in position.

352
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,733
- Anything else?
- Yes.

353
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,027
No coagulation
in the fingertips.

354
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,403
- Shit!

355
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,654
- What?

356
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,865
- He cut their hands off
while they were still alive.

357
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,241
- Jesus!

358
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,952
- Are those them?
- Yeah.

359
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,538
- What name is that?
- Nicole Panna.

360
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,041
- Hm.
Does that mean anything to you?

361
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,709
- No, why?
Should it?

362
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,342
- Carl Watkins.

363
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,885
[Christine] Who?

364
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,303
- Local perp.

365
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,679
Flasher.
Kiddie porn peddler.

366
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:19,847
We picked him up
a couple times,

367
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,808
but he always pled out
or made a deal informing.

368
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,018
- So what does he
have to do with this?

369
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,103
- All of these girls went to
Chase Terrace Academy.

370
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,688
Terrace put a restraining order
against him

371
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,106
after he was caught
a few times

372
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,526
loitering and jerking off
to the girls in gym class.

373
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,236
- That's a real stretch, David.

374
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,447
- Guess who also went to
Terrace a few years back?

375
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,449
- Crystal Lanning.

376
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,450
- Exactly.

377
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,035
- Seriously?

378
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,037
Do we have
a current address on him?

379
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,832
[landlady] He's not in.

380
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,085
That cocksucker
owes me two months' rent.

381
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,711
He hasn't been here
for a couple of days.

382
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,046
- Think he'd be
hiding out inside?

383
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,882
- If he is, he's freezing
his ass off in the dark.

384
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,218
I cut his power yesterday.
[chuckles]

385
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,971
- Seriously?

386
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,056
No windows?

387
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,643
- Honey, with what those boys
are doin' in there,

388
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,812
no windows
ain't a bad thing.

389
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,149
[landlady] Shut the door
when you leave.

390
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,030
[coughing]

391
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,407
[Christine]
What an incredible smell

392
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,575
you've discovered.

393
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,327
[David]
Oh, this shouldn't take long.

394
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,583
[Christine]
This guy seems to have

395
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,086
quite the right arm.

396
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,338
Doesn't really seem like
the Preceptor type.

397
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,174
[David]
Speak of the devil.

398
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,063
- Looks like it's typed
on an old manual typewriter.

399
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,690
- Let's get that back
to the lab.

400
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,692
- Uh-hm.
- Put out an ATL on Watkins.

401
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,611
In the meantime,
let's hit the usual suspects.

402
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,155
You go with David.

403
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,542
- Anything?

404
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,461
[David] Nope.

405
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,129
Done for the day?

406
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,297
- Yeah.

407
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,966
I'm going to swing by Watkins'
apartment on the way home.

408
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,468
- What's up?

409
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,428
- Somethin's been
buggin' me about it.

410
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:25,598
- Give our regards

411
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,767
to that sweet-mouthed
landlady for me.

412
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,310
- I'll give her your number.

413
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,523
[door opens and closes]

414
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,358
- Thanks for turnin'
the power on.

415
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,995
[computer dings]

416
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,415
[music building to cresendo]

417
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,184
[door opens]

418
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,645
- Excuse me.
Detective Sean Carter.

419
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,815
[piano notes playing]

420
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,867
[The Auditor] Mr. Carter.

421
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,121
Mr. Carter.

422
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,956
You're a man
of some interest to us.

423
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,626
- What do you want to know?

424
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,462
- Excuse me?
- You obviously have questions.

425
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,089
- Why would you say that?

426
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,216
- Because if you wanted me dead,
I'd be dead already.

427
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,093
- That's very true.
What else?

428
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,056
- If I had to guess,
I've stumbled into a painful,

429
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,725
possibly fatal situation,

430
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,561
the agenda of which
you'll soon tell me.

431
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:36,979
- Ha!

432
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,774
- What can you tell me
about Carl Watkins?

433
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,944
- A man of impeccable taste,
apparently.

434
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,738
- What can you tell me
about the Preceptor?

435
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,365
- I was about to ask you
the same question.

436
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,120
- What are those?

437
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,124
- [clears throat] Well,
since you've been good enough

438
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,209
not to waste our time
with the usual drudgery

439
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:03,464
of who are you
and save me, et cetera,

440
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,216
perhaps a reward is in order.

441
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,102
- Dear God! Where am I?

442
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,023
- You wanted to know
about these.

443
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:25,569
They are a linking mechanism
between our world and yours.

444
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,572
They are judgment and redemption
to those who open them.

445
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,866
They are sensation,

446
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,661
rebirth...death,

447
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,372
lust...hate.

448
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,332
All manner of emotions.

449
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,168
They are a conduit
to the unimaginable.

450
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:48,175
- In a wooden box.

451
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,844
- You'd be amazed what
they can do when opened.

452
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,846
- What on earth is this place?

453
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,556
- It isn't.

454
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,560
- So now what?

455
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:02,314
- This is the beginning of
a process, an interview.

456
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,649
An audit of sorts.

457
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:04,984
- And you want honest answers.

458
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,068
- Absolutely.

459
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,653
- So then let's just
get on with it.

460
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,154
- Hmmpf.

461
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,907
Tempus fugit after all.

462
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:16,453
Tell me, when was the first time
you hurt something?

463
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,372
Be honest, Mr. Carter.

464
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,668
The sooner you tell the truth,
the sooner you will be free.

465
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,336
- Four.

466
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:32,636
We had a pet dog.

467
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,598
I hit it.

468
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:38,976
Should I go on?

469
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:44,273
- March 31, 2004.

470
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:45,691
- I was 25.

471
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,486
The bullet hit him
in the throat.

472
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:55,826
I saw a fist-size chunk
blown out the back of his neck.

473
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,037
I stood over him
and watched him die.

474
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,414
- And after that?

475
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,291
- Two kids.

476
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,876
Grenade.

477
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:07,129
It was the first time I'd ever
seen a body blown to pieces.

478
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,507
Skin stripped from muscle.

479
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,260
Flesh stripped from bone.

480
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,264
- You were a man
protecting his country.

481
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,392
You were permitted to
carry out these acts,

482
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:24,063
but what were you
permitted to feel?

483
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:27,900
What did you feel?
- What did I feel?

484
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,276
What the hell
was I supposed to feel?

485
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,945
- You have killed
a great many people.

486
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,197
- I was doing my job.

487
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,531
- You will purge from yourself

488
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,159
the guilt of shedding
innocent blood.

489
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,953
For you have done what is right
in the eyes of the Lord.

490
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,581
- Only God can judge me!

491
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,583
And God will judge
both the righteous man

492
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,626
and the wicked man.

493
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,086
- Ecclesiastes 3:17.

494
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,921
- Deuteronomy 21:9.

495
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,881
- Ha!

496
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,759
I would like to dig
a little deeper.

497
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,512
- What choice do I have?

498
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:57,763
- None.

499
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:01,266
[typewriter keys clacking]

500
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,815
- On my second tour,
the convoy hit, and I...

501
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,817
[voice becomes indistinct].

502
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,578
There are still more.

504
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,428
- "It is a terrible, ponderous
chain you are making, Scrooge."

505
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,516
- Charles Dickens.

506
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,393
Now what?

507
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,895
- Next,
you'll meet the assessor,

508
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,440
and my, what a meal
he has ahead of him.

509
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,204
- Hmmpf, hmmpf.

510
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:13,463

513
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,344
- What have you done?

514
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,652
- You will be taken
to be cleaned

515
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:18,403
and then to the surgeon.
[bell tolls]

516
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,492
[whooshing sound]
Oh. No, it can't be.

517
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,758
[woman] I hate this place.

518
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,301
The stench, the dark hole.

519
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,428
The seedy games
and indulgences

we allow you to play
as part of the arrangement.

521
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,809
- Why are you here?
- Let him go.

522
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,185
He has no business here.

523
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,311
- I don't understand.

524
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,189
- Well, just because
it falls into your web

525
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,316
does not make it prey
for the spider.

526
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,360
Catch and release.
Do you understand?

527
00:37:58,485 --> 00:37:59,486
- What about the assessor?

528
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,197
- Clerical error,
quite literally.

529
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,657
- I've never...
- I don't care!

530
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,534
The jury never passed
their verdict.

531
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:06,994
You'll let him go,

532
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,120
- Not really, no.

533
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,831
- Well, do you understand
who is in charge?

534
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,376
So let him go.

535
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,755
Do not give me a reason
to come back here.

536
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,018
- [screams and groans]

537

540
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:32,871
- You must be cleaned
on the inside too!

541
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,871
- No!

542
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,964
- A moment of your time.

543
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,424
A-- a candidate...

544
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,093
I need your assistance
with your--your guidance.

545
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,177
- What?

546
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,222
- His answers
choked the assessor.

547
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,890
Forced the jury in.

548
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,769
So...what do you feel?

549
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,230
- Innocent?

550
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,065
Where is he now?

551
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,401
- I sent him to be cleaned.

552
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,378
- He's gone!

553
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,672
Escaped
with one of the boxes.

554
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,424
- The pages.

555
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,347
Take.

556
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:17,434
Eat this in remembrance
of my body.

557
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,897
- You must go after him.

558
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,149
Bring him back.
We must dig deeper.

559
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,860
We must find out what you feel
once you've released.

560
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,366
- There's no need
to go after him.

561
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,619
He'll be back.

[car door opens/closes]

564
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,253
- You...you
got your flashlight?

565
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,964
- Yeah, why?
- I'll drive.

566
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:30,173
- Why? What's up?

567
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,009
Huh?

568
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,511

Come on, man!

576
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,162
Nice. Nice place.

577
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,540
Put an offer in yet?

578
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,001
- Or are you in escrow?
- Fuck. [sighs]

579
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,178
- Hey!

580
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,721
What is going on?

581
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,014
You drag my ass out here

582
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,099
in the middle of the fucking
night with no explanation?

583
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:06,102
You barely
talk to me anymore, man.

584
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,731
Alison is worried
about you.

586
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,693
- Man, we're all worried
about you, Sean.

587
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,071
- I'll drive you back
to your car.

622

[Christine]
So what's on your mind?

623
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,357
Your brother?

624
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,484
- Just curious.

625
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:09,155
You been here for a couple
of days, what do you see?

626
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,700
- I see two people
mired in a pretty dark case.

627
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,577
One of whom
is probably internalizing

628
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,913
a little bit too much of it.

629
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:21,209
Honestly, I don't know
that I would be any different.

630
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,336
- Yeah, he's not running right.

631
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,921
- Did you talk to
somebody about that?

632
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,715
- Not official,
but I do talk to his wife.

633
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,342
- Alison.

634
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,677
- Yeah.

635
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:31,928
How did you know that?

636
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,848
- Did he ever suffer from
any PTSD when he came back?

637
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,475
- Not that I know of,

638
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,269
but he's never really talked
about what went on over there.

639
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:42,438
- Drinking, drugs?

640
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,564
None of that?

641
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:49,821
- He drank for a little while,
but he is sober now.

642
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:52,198
Just lately he's been distant.

643
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,283
I think maybe it's starting to
have an effect on him.

644
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:58,538
- I...

[bird squawking]

00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:02,667
- What?

647
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,338
- Look, I was assigned
to this case for two reasons:

648
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,841
One of them is to expedite
the catching of the Preceptor

649
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:11,009
and the other is because

650
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:13,720
there are some concerns
about Sean's behavior.

651
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,221
So, I am here
first and foremost

652
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:18,099
to help you with the case
but also to evaluate.

653
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,101
- We've been working
our ass off on this case.

654
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,061
- And it's not about that!

655
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,855
This is genuine concern
for someone

656
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,356
who might be in too deep.

What?

662
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,163
He is?

663
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,750
Don't worry about it.

664
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:44,709
I'll come by and pick him up.

665
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,711
You take Sara to school.

666
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,254
Okay.

667
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,048
His car broke down.
Have to go pick him up.

668
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,424
- He didn't call you?

669
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:52,425
- I gotta go.

670
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,324

I'll go take a shower.

- Ah, wait a second, please.

675
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,763
You got to straighten up.

676
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:43,392
Just in case Egerton has other
motivations for being with us.

677
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:44,894
- Meaning what?

678
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,063
- Think about it.

679
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,816
How long have you been
drinking again?

680
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:51,317
- Alison and I got
in a bit of a fight.

681
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,444
I had a few drinks.
It caught up with me.

682
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:54,779
I got this.

683
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:56,239
- Go get cleaned up.

684
00:51:58,616 --> 00:51:59,492
Sean...

685
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,705
no one is judging you.

686
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,001
- Like I told somebody else,
only God can judge me.

687
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:10,169
God will judge
both the righteous man

688
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,629
and the wicked man.

689
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,658

690
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:43,494
"It was the worst of times."

691
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,454

like that...

00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,116

Hey.

695
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,262
- Take a look at this.

696
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,556
This is the first letter
from the Preceptor.

697
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,433
Read here.

698
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,268
- "There is no accountability.

"I will bring back
the wrath of the Almighty.

700

"It will be
the season of darkness

703
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,236
And?

704
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:00,613
- And I just found this
at Sean's house.

705
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,198
- Hmmm, Dickens.

706
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,449
He didn't tell you about this?

707
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,409
- He mentioned the book,
but he didn't mention this.

708
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,494
- Well, maybe he just
put it together.

709
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:07,620
- Then why didn't
he say anything?

710
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,956
- I don't know.
You should ask him.

711
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:10,957
Where is he?

712
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:12,083
- He's on his way.

713
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:14,335
- I thought he had
some kind of car trouble.

714
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,462
- He did not have car trouble.

715
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,923
He was drunk,
and I had to go help him.

716
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:20,174
[Christine]
You said he was sober.

717
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,300
- He was. He is.

718
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:22,551
- David, what the fuck
is going on?

719
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:23,803
- I don't know.

720
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,388
That's why I came to you.

721
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:26,806
- We're going to
have to talk to him.

722
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,224
[phone rings]

723
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,934
- [door opens]
- Okay.

724
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,060
[Sean]
Talk to who?

725
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,271
- Who or what
happened to your face?

726
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:35,147
- About what?

727
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:37,942
[phone ringing]

728
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,277
Hello.

729
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:40,945
Yes, this is Carter.

730
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,114
Yes. That Carter.

731
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,074
He did.

732
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,450
What exactly?

733
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,036
Phone?

734
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,246
Where?

735
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,457
We'll be there.

736
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,419
Medical examiner.

737
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:59,255
Found Crystal Lanning's
cell phone.

738
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,673
Wedged down her throat.

739
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,509
- You're kidding me.
- He wants us there.

740
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:04,552
- Okay.

741
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:05,678
You and I go.

742
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,014
David stays here and goes
through some of that evidence.

743
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,015
- Okay.

744
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,266
- Okay.

745
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,027
- Shit!

746
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:22,194
Forgot my phone.

747
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,904
Just give me a sec.

748
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:32,955
- Forget your cell phone?

749
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:36,500
- Need you to do me a favor.

750
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,127
Take a quick look around.

751
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,047
See if you find
anything unusual.

752
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,256
- I'm not investigating
my brother.

753
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,091
- I'm not asking you to.

754
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,217
Take a look.

755
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,553
For his sake.

756
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:48,637
- Okay.

757
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:49,764
- Okay.

758
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,775
- Well, it seems to be
running okay now.

759
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,193
- What?

760
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:05,738
- The car. David said you had
some car trouble this morning.

761
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,782
- Marriage trouble.

762
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:08,866
- Oh.

763
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,493
At least you're honest.

764
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,917
Can I ask you something?

765
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,460
Honestly?

766
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,629
Do you think you're too close
to this case?

767
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:23,672
- Probably, but it's my work.

768
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,925
- Yeah, but if it's tearing
your world apart.

769
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,051
[Sean]
What can I do?

770
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:28,219
There's only
one commandment left.

771
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,929
Got to finish it all the way
to the end, right?

772
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,598
- I get that, and I think
it's really admirable,

773
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,226
but this is not a tour of duty.

774
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:36,644
- It is for me.

775
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,443
- I was reading through some of
the notes from the Preceptor.

776
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:48,114
I noticed a lot of the turn
of phrase is very poetic.

777
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,241
Almost reads like literature.

778
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,493
You know, David mentioned
that you read a lot,

779
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:57,748
so I thought I'd ask if anything
struck a chord with you.

780
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:58,874
- Not really.

781
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,628
I mean, there are
a couple of lines

782
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,755
lifted from <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>
by Dickens,

783
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,591
but nothing else comes to mind.

784
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:10,136
- Did you bring that up
in the investigation?

785
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:11,804
- Didn't seem relevant.

786
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,807
After all, it is the most
popular book on the planet.

787
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,058
- Oh.

788
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,060
Yeah.

789
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,689
I guess it is.

790
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,067
[Sean]
Hodges.

791
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,655
- Hodges.
- [Hodges] Hey.

792
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,742
See...

793
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:36,579
yeah.

794
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,166
- I thought you said
you found a cell phone.

795
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,126
- We did.
In her throat.

796
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,836
We found that
in her mouth first.

797
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:44,837
- Silver?

798
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,505
- Born with a silver spoon
in her mouth.

799
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,507
- She certainly died that way.

800
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:51,469
We found this
in her esophagus.

801
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:54,180
Way down in there.

802
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,347
Damn shame.

803
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:57,391
- Yeah.
She was only 21.

804
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,560
- Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

805
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,270
Nobody has an iPhone 7.

806
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:02,730
I still got a 4.

807
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,858
- Thanks, Hodges.
Thanks for the information.

808
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,109
- It still works.

809
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:10,571
- What?
- The phone.

810
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,490
Yeah. One of the kids here
has the same model,

811
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:14,033
so we managed to
power the thing up.

812
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:16,535
When we did, it turns out
she was using the GPS app.

813
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,245
- The location on it
wasn't her apartment?

814
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,914
[Hodges] No. We checked.

815
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:22,583
She wasn't killed
in the apartment either.

816
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,585
What he did took time, and uh,

817
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,754
would leave quite the mess.

818
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,631
Yeah, especially with the dog.

819
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:32,468
No. He took her somewhere alive,
prepped her, killed her.

820
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:35,679
Luckily, if you can say that,
her phone died with her.

821
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,890
So, it stored
her last location.

822
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,475
- Serial killer
caught by smartphone.

823
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,561
Do you have the address?

824
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,396
- You know, I haven't
seen you around here before.

825
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,899
- Yeah. I was just
assigned to the case.

826
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,025
- Single?

827
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,151
- You're kidding, right?

828
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:04,625
- I'll call it in.

829
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,086
<i>Yeah. This is
Detective Sean Carter.</i>

830
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,505
<i>We're on the scene of
a possibly compromised location.</i>

831
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,715
<i>Requesting uniform backup.</i>

832
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,052
Address is 12437 Gladstone.

833
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,222
<i>Looks like a disused
warehouse of some kind.</i>

834
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:20,641
Okay. Copy that.

835
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:22,935
- I think this is
pretty locked up.

836
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,689
Yeah.

837
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:27,773
- Guess we'll be waiting.
- I don't know.

838
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,608
I think I hear
a struggle of some kind,

839
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,569
destruction of evidence.

840
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,280
- I don't hear anything.

841
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:35,698
- Well, if you did, we wouldn't
have to wait for a warrant.

842
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:36,991
You want to catch
this guy, right?

843
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,033
- Of course I do.

844
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,243
- Then we hear a struggle.

845
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,244
[Sean]
Over here.

846
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:26,749
[door squeaks]

847
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,171
[Sean]
Look at this.

848
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,222
- It's him.

849
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,752
[phone rings]

850
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,384
- Holy shit!

[loud rock music]

855
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:52,895
- Drop it!

856
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:57,733
- Fuck!

857
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,655
Backup's on the way.

858
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,365
- No, they're not.

859
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,284
But someone is.

860
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,495
Now move to the fucking
center of the room.

861
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,752
How did you find out?

862
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:18,879
- You told me.

863
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:28,430
<i>What was it he said?
"Only God can judge me.</i>

864
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,266
<i>"God will judge the righteous.</i>

01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,853
<i>"God will judge

Preceptor.

875
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:01,129
Shit!

876
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,298
Shit!

877
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,135
When I didn't hear back
from Egerton,

878
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,388
I called Hodges
to get the address.

879
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,890
- Quite the detective.

880
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,475
- Why are you doing this?

881
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,768
- Like I've always told you,

882
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,187
you should read more
starting with the Bible.

883
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:18,730
[Alison]
Sean?

884
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,607
- You wouldn't call backup
on your own brother.

885
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:21,733
Not until you knew for sure.

886
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:23,944
So, I called someone else.

887
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:26,697
In here.

888
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:28,907
[door opens and closes]

889
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,410
- I came as fast as I could.

890
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:32,828
- Shit!

891
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,832
- Sean, what are you doing?

892
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:39,501
Sean?

893
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:42,754
What is this?
What's going on?

894
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,881
- Come on in, sweetheart.

895
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:46,008
Come stand
next to my dear brother.

896
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,845
- [Alison gasps]
- No, no.

897
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,180
Go stand next to David.

898
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,769
[yelling]
I didn't say touch her!

899
01:04:57,895 --> 01:05:00,272
[Alison sobs]

900
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:04,860
- I have so much more
planned for the two of you.

901
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:07,863
That Lanning bitch's cell phone
fucked things up!

902
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:09,031
- I don't understand.

903
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,200
- You don't?

904
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:13,660
Look around.

905
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:14,995
Look at what I've done.

906
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,707
This is the love of God
that we keep his commandments,

907
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,627
and his commandments
are not burdensome.

908
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,337
- Where is Egerton?

909
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,508
[Alison]
Oh!

910
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:29,635
[David]
Jesus Christ!

911
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,137
[Alison sobs]

912
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:36,058
- Sean, no, no.

913
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:38,185
Wait, wait. We...we...

914
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:48,362
- This whore cheated on me
with some guy she met online

915
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:51,823
two weeks after I left
for my first tour.

916
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:52,991
- I'm sorry.

917
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,953
- Thou shall not covet
another man's wife.

918
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,122
So I cut his eyelids off

919
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,667
and burned him alive
in his own car.

920
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:09,299
I wasn't surprised with her,
but I expected more of you.

921
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:10,300
- Sean, I am...

922
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:14,721
- A plague of
smartphone junkies.

923
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:19,685
I...loathe the modern world.

924
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,145
I loathe the populace.

925
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:26,149
If I had the means and ways,
I would incinerate them all.

926
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:29,653
Rain down fire
and sulphur.

927
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,032
Now.

928
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:37,369
I want you to sit down
in front of each other.

929
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:40,038
[yelling]
Just do it!

930
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:41,915
[David]
What are you going to do?

931
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,001
[Alison sobs]

932
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:50,799
[Sean]
Open that.

933
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,050
- What?

934
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,593
[David]
What the fuck is this?

935
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:54,678
- Open it.
Both of you.

936
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,263
Now. Together.

937
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:02,686
[Alison gasps]

938
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,609
[thunder and lightning]

939
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:16,158
[chains clanging]

940
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,660
- What is this?
What's happening?

941
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:24,541
[Alison sobs]

942
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:25,667
- Judgment!

943
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,758
[Alison sobs]

944
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:36,303
[Pinhead] I knew you would
find your way here eventually.

945
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:44,728
After all...

946
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:51,443
evil seeks evil.

947
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,784
- I knew someone
would come for me.

948
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:00,452
So, I thought
I'd save you the time

949
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:01,870
and offer you a deal.

950
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,332
- There is no deal
to be made.

951
01:08:05,457 --> 01:08:06,958
- Them for me.

952
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:08,126
Adulterers.

953
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:09,377
They opened the box.

954
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:11,463
- And they will be
dealt with accordingly.

955
01:08:12,631 --> 01:08:15,008
It is a separate faction
who has want of you,

956
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,803
and there is no bargaining
to be done.

957
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:19,513
- Ah, Mr. Carter.

958
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:21,556
So good to see you again.

959
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,641
And you brought friends.

960
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,684
- I brought them
to trade for me.

961
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:26,645
- That is not how it works.

962
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,526
- I won't go back
in that room.

963
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:41,785
- Mr. Carter, please.
That won't work for you now.

964
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:43,787
Mr. Carter.

965
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,831
[screams]

966
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:47,833
[groans]

967
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,794
[screams]

968
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,009
[Pinhead]
You have been found guilty

969
01:08:58,135 --> 01:08:59,261
by the jury.

970
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:00,178
[sobs]

971
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,306
You'll be taken to be
cleaned...again.

972
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,767
- [screams]
- And then to the Surgeon.

973
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,269
- Not me!

974
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,358
- The pages of your audit
were so rancid

975
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,818
with the essence
of your guilt,

976
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:18,655
they made
even the Assessor choke.

977
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,366
When the Surgeon and the Butcher
are finished with you,

978
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:25,787
you will be reborn
into an eternity of agony.

979
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,038
- What the fuck is going on?

980
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:28,206
- Silence!

981
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,959
Your pitiful adultery
is beneath me.

982
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:35,547
Bow your head to the catalog of
filth your brother has created.

983
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:43,638
[screams]

984
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:46,683
[groans]

985
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,576
- Amateurs.

986
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:07,412
But still we will afford them
an experience

987
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,332
beyond the limits
in your name.

988
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,710
[woman]
Get away from him.

989
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:25,931
- How do you feel,
Eden's doorman?

990
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,182
- Once upon a time.

991
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,767
- And then what was it?

992
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:33,563
Watching over the ark-builder's
incestuous offspring until now.

993
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:36,274
- I want to turn
this basement into misfits.

994
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,901
- He was found guilty.

995
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:39,444
- Let him go!

996
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,113
There are matters at play here
that are part of a bigger plan.

997
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,282
And he is a part of it.

998
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:47,452
- You want him now
to remain on Earth...

999
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:50,497
or rather He wants him
out of there.

1000
01:10:50,622 --> 01:10:52,582
He wants his flock
afraid of the horse

1001
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,168
so that they look
toward the light.

1002
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,671
- You're not as foolish
as you look.

1003
01:10:57,796 --> 01:10:59,297
- But what about the things
he has done,

1004
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,299
the innocents he has killed?

1005
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,385
- Acceptable losses.

1006
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,806
Good cannot exist without evil.

1007
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:11,434
And we discovered long ago that
in order to control the evil,

1008
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:14,020
we had to be the ones
implementing it.

1009
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:16,648
- Sin ordained by Heaven.

1010
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:21,987
- Send him back.

1011
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:28,451
- Continue with your work,
Preceptor.

1012
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:31,913
With our blessing.

1013
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:36,126
- And the Lord saw
that the sin of man

1014
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:38,628
was great on the Earth,

1015
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,339
and that all the thoughts
of his heart were evil.

1016
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,342
[Pinhead]
There is process...

1017
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,844
order to what we do.

1018
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,013
- Send him back!

1019
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:49,848
- Or?

1020
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:53,268
- There will be hell to pay.

1021
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:56,896
- Hell...to...pay.

1022
01:11:57,022 --> 01:11:58,440
- Don't test me!

1023
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,738
- Very well.

1024
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,700
[screams]

1025
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,872
[Sean] Now get me
the fuck outta here!

1026
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:14,873
I've been forgiven.

1027
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,375
- Not forgiven.

1028
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,586
- What?
[woman] You're a murderer!

1029
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,087
A twisted sadist.

1030
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,214
For now, your actions
work in our favor.

1031
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,801
But there will be judgment
for you eventually.

1032
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,137
- And, we will be waiting.

1033
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:30,263
- Fuck you!

1034
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:34,434
[rapid gunshots]

1035
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,977
- Now send him back.

1036
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:37,979
- With pleasure.

1037
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:47,572
- I'm back.

1038
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:59,167
[choking]

1039
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,378
- "Tis a far, far..."
- [gunshots]

1040
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:03,671
[gasps]

1041
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,597
[heavy breathing]

1042
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:18,061
We have an officer down
at 12437 Gladstone.

1043
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:19,729
Send assistance.

1044
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,940
This is Egerton.

1045
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:23,775
We have the Preceptor.

1046
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,609
[sighs]

1047
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,903
Get me a fucking ambulance!

1048
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:30,782
- You knew that would happen.

1049
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,951
- You know nothing
of human behavior.

1050
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,619
[sobs]

1051
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,372
<i>[woman]
There will be retaliation.</i>

1052
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:40,041
<i>You will suffer.</i>

1053
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,377
- Suffer?

1054
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:45,713
Me?

1055
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:53,471
How dare you use such a word?

1056
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,598
You know nothing of suffering.

1057
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:58,059
I welcome its warm embrace.

1058
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:01,229
I exist only to
share its meaning.

1059
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:05,650
Sin and suffering
are my dominion.

1060
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,735
Perhaps it's time
you learned a little

1061
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:10,029
of the matters
you seek to manage.

1062
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:15,994
[screams]

1063
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:17,328
[woman]
What are you doing?

1064
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:20,665
Do you know who I am?

1065
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:21,958
- I care not.

1066
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:27,714
Irony.

1067
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:30,508
[heavy breathing]

1068
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:36,097
[sobs]

1069
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:54,616
- Are you the way?

1070
01:14:58,286 --> 01:15:00,830
- Do your worst!

1071
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:06,002
You forget
my first tasks for Him.

1072
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:09,339
And my order
has already been sanctioned.

1073
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:10,548
- Look at me.

1074
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:13,635
I'm all you know.

1075
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,096
Forged in agony and pain.

1076
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:19,933
I welcome
the eternity of anguish.

1077
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:22,477
- So, Pinhead....

1078
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:27,232
[snickers]

1079
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:28,733
[screams]

1080
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,202
- Here endeth the lesson.

1081
01:15:40,495 --> 01:15:43,039
- Jesus wept!

1082
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:46,000
[snickers]

1083
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:05,603
- Probably should not
have done that.

1084
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,855
- I have nothing to fear.

1085
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,190
- Did you forget?

1086
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:12,652
She is the angel who banished
them from the Garden of Eden.

1087
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:16,864
Perhaps there is a torture
we cannot endure.

1088
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:18,533
Banishment.

1089
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:24,247
[church bells toll]

1090
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,248
<i>Banishment.</i>

1091
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,584
<i>Exile.</i>

1092
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:29,794
<i>Back to the mortal world.</i>

1093
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:32,255
<i>Banishment.</i>

1094
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,973
[screams]

1095
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:44,142
- Sweet suffering.

1096
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,602
The sweet suffering.

1097
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:51,065
[screams] No!

1098
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,240
[screams] No!

1099
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:12,086
[♪♪♪]

1100
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:32,995
[knock on door]

1101
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,957
[speaking foreign language]

1102
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:47,260
- Two, and it isn't even
a Tuesday.

1103
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:48,928
[door slams shut]

1104
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:53,850
