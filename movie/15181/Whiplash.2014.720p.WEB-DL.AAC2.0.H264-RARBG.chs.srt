不管你是谁 这是你最后的机会  
Whoever it is, this is your last chance.

140

好吧你错过了  
And there it went.

141
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:28,152
要么你是故意跑调拖乐队后腿    
Now either you are deliberately playing out-of-tone and sabotaging my band

142
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:31,234
要么你自己都不知道自己跑调了  
Or you don't know you are out-of-tone 

143
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,621
那恐怕就更糟了  
which I'm afraid is even worse.

144
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,856

你觉得自己跑调了么   
Do you think you are out of tone?

151

你看什... 地上又没巧克力你看什么看    
What're you... There's no fucking Mars bar down there, what are you looking at?

抬起头 看着我   
Look up here, look at me.

跑了   
Yes.

155
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:56,997
那你他妈的不吭声？！   
Then why the fuck didn't you say so?!

156
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,000
梅茨你这死胖子在这待太久了    
I carried your fat ass for too long Metz

157
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,137
我不能让一每天就知道惦记着儿童套餐不顾音调的傻逼毁了比赛   
I'm not gonna have you cost us a competition because your mind's on a fucking Happy Meal instead of on pitch.

158
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:08,493
恭喜杰克逊 你是四席了   
Jackson congratulations, you are fourth chair.

159

Mets why are you still sitting there, get the fuck out!

160
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:31,800
说明下 梅茨没跑调    
For the record, Mets wasn't out of tone

161
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,000
跑调的是你 埃里克森    
You were, Ericson

162
00:21:34,268 --> 00:21:35,225
但是他自己都不知道    
But he didn't know. 

163
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:37,200
那已经够糟了 
And that's bad enough.

164
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:43,827
休息10分钟 回来后小毛孩上   
Alright take 10, when we get back the squeaker is on.

我爸是个作家  
My dad's a writer. 

170
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:16,292

Oh what's he written

171
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:19,259
主要还是当老师了  
I guess he's more of a teacher. Really.

172
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,058
大学？

What about your mother? What does she do?

175
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:29,000
我不知道 很小时候她就离开了 
I don't know. She left when I was a baby.

176
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,318
所以家里没有做音乐的？ 
So no musicians in the family?

You know Charlie Parker became Bird because Jo threw a cymbal at his head

180
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,053
懂我意思么？

关键在于放松

316
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:30,315
还不知道呢    
I don't know yet.

317
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:34,150
所以说福特汉姆就是随手挑的？   
So Fordham was just like a random school?

No I've applied a bunch of schools, Fordham let me in.

那你为什么去谢尔佛？ 
Why do you go to Shaffer?

那..  福特汉姆就是福特汉姆而已了   
Well Fordham is Fordham.

I don't know... I guess it's just people there don't like me very much.

00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,146
我觉得人都会... 变得嘛  
I think it's just... it changes.

332
00:33:22,352 --> 00:33:25,247
人变了... 也就没事了    
You know people change, things work out.

333

00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,677
-视觉提示物？  -有这种健康问题   
-Visual cues?  -It's a medical condition..

409
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:43,810
健康问题？你他妈以为自己是舟舟啊？给我打鼓去!  
Medical condition? What are you, fucking Sunjay Gupta? Play the goddamn music!

410
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,090
-我真不行 -我行    
-I can't -I can.

411
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
你背过Whiplash的谱子了？  
You know Whiplash by heart?

412
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:53,969
背过了 每个拍子都记得   
Yes sir, every measure.

413
00:38:56,565 --> 00:39:00,203
好吧 你最好祈祷你记得够清楚   
Alright. You better fucking hope your memory doesn't fail you

414
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,500
并且比上次排练的时候打的好很多  
And and you can play a whole lot better than you did last month at the rehearsal

415
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,574
我可不准备现在就卷铺盖回家  
Because I do not intend start losing now.

416
00:39:05,574 --> 00:39:07,700
拿好槌子滚上台去  
Get your stick and get your fucking ass on the stage.

417
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:08,650
上台！  
On stage!

418
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
第一名   
And first place

419
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:34,500
谢尔佛音乐学院

420
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,645
别碰我谱子啊    
Don't touch my folder man.

421
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,000
别碰我鼓架   
Do not touch this kit.

422
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:07,460
好了开工吧女士们    
Alright let's get to work ladies.

423
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:11,367
坦纳你来干嘛了 今天是核心排练 没时间调教替补   
Tanner what are you doing? It's core only today, I don't have time for alternates. 

424
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:16,610
Cherokee 从头开始  
Cherokee, from the top. 

425
00:41:25,578 --> 00:41:28,000
你他妈是雕像么 动啊    
Tanner are you a fucking statue? Let's go!

426
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
别傻坐着  
Get off the stool.

427
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:38,098
别忘了给内曼翻乐谱  
Don't forget to turn Neyman's pages.

428
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,166

妮可：回来以后给我电话，我过去找你？

430
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,272
音乐室乐队怎么样了？  
So how's everything going with the Studio Band?

431
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:12,135
挺好的 我觉得他越来越喜欢我了  
Good. I think he likes me more now.

432
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,300
他的看法对你很重要是吧   
And his opinion means a lot to you, doesn't it?

433
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:18,713
嗯  
Yeah

434
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,800
帮我端下菜

435
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:26,816
这菜快糊了哎   
overcooked.

436
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
嚼不动嘛
can barely chew this

437
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:31,407
他刚走  
He just left.

438
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:33,300
安迪 鼓打的怎么样啦   
So how's drumming going Andy?

439
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,666
嗯特好 我是新核心鼓手了  
Yeah it's going really well. I'm the new core drummer...

440
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:44,717
-你听说了么？ -没 怎么了？  
-Did you hear yet?  -No, what happened?

441
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,610
特拉维斯拿了最有价值球员   
Travis just got MVP

442
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,900
牛逼啊！ 
That's fantastic!

443
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:53,646
达斯汀进模拟联合国了 很快就能拿罗德学者奖学金啦  
Dustin is heading up Model UN, soon-to-be-Rhodes-Scholar and who knows what

444
00:42:54,165 --> 00:42:55,981
吉姆还是年度教师 
And Jim, teacher of the year

445
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:59,978
真的 这一家子都是天赋异禀啊   
I mean, come on, the talent of this table, that is stunning.

446
00:43:01,598 --> 00:43:03,142
哦还有安迪 打鼓  
And Andy, with your drumming.

447
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:04,641
还行吧安迪?  
It's going ok, Andy?

448
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:06,598
嗯特别 特别好   
Yeah I mean it's going really, really well.

449
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,647
我进了谢尔佛学院最好的爵士乐团    
Actually I'm part of Shaffer's top Jazz orchestra

450
00:43:09,813 --> 00:43:12,200
也就是是全国最顶尖的  
Which means I'm.. it's the best in the country.

451
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:16,085
我还是核心乐手 跟着乐队到处比赛  
And.. I'm a core member, so I just started playing competitions 

452
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,627
前两天发现自己还是全乐队最小的  
Actually I just found out I'm the youngest person in the entire band.

453
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:23,320
音乐比赛怎么算赢？应该都是主观感受吧  
How do you know wins or not.. a music competition? Isn't it subjective?

454
00:43:24,422 --> 00:43:25,233
不是 
No.

455
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:26,722
音乐室给你工作么？  
Does the studio get you a job?

456
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:29,500
不是那种音乐室 “音乐室”只是乐队的名字  
No it's not an actual studio, it's just the name of the ensemble

457
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,300
但这对我的职业生涯帮助很大 
but yeah it's a big step for my career.

458
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:34,874
嗯干得不错就好 我们都知道这行很乱  
Well I'm so glad you figured it out, it's a nasty business I am sure.

459
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,743
哦对了 赶快给我们讲讲这礼拜的球赛！
Oh are you gonna tell them about your game this week?

460
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:39,394
什么叫名副其实！  
Lived up to your title

461
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:41,363
我推了93码达阵     
I scored 93 yard touchdown

462
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:42,833
学校新纪录啊   
School record, school record!

463
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:46,200
那是三区的球队   
It's division III.

464
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:52,500
卡尔顿的校队么 三区的 连二区都没进呢  
It's Carleton football, it's not even division II, it's division III

465
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:55,100
你有朋友么安迪 
You got any friends Andy? 

466
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:56,552
-没有  -为什么？ 
-No. -Why's that?

467
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:58,780
不知道 没觉得朋友有什么用  
I don't know, I just never really saw the use.

468
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:00,800
那你平时都跟谁玩啊 
Well, who are you going to play with otherwise? 

469
00:44:00,844 --> 00:44:03,016
列侬和麦卡尼在学校就是好哥们儿 对吧 
Lennon and McCartney, they were school friends, am I right? 

470
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:06,437
乔.琼斯拿钵砸查理.帕克之前 查理也没有朋友  
Charlie Parker didn't know anybody 'til Joe Jones threw a cymbal at his head. 

471
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,822
所以在你看来那就算成功？
So that's your idea of success, huh? 

472
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:11,409
我觉得成为20世纪最伟大的音乐家在谁看来都算成功 
I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody's idea of success. 

473
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:16,369
酗酒吸毒34岁就家破人亡在我看来可不算成功 
Dying broke and drunk and full of heroin at the age of 34 is not exactly my idea of success.

474
00:44:16,438 --> 00:44:19,705
我宁愿酗酒吸毒 34岁就家破人亡 成为人们晚餐桌上的话题 
I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me 

475
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:23,578
也不愿意腰缠万贯满面红光的活到90岁 但是没人记得我 
than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was. 

476
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:26,178
但是你的朋友记得你 那才是重点 
Ah, but your friends will remember you, that's the point. 

477
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
我们谁都不是查理.帕克的朋友 那才是重点 
None of us were friends with Charlie Parker. That's the point. 

478
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,382
特拉维斯和达斯汀 朋友很多 目标也很多 
Travis and Dustin? They have plenty of friends and plenty of purpose. 

479
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:34,678
嗯当学生会主席在合适不过了 
I'm sure they'll make great school board presidents someday. 

480
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,916
原来你就是跟这个过不去么？你觉得你比我们强？
Oh, that's what this is all about? You think you're better than us? 

481
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,595
反应挺快的啊 模联出来的？ 
You catch on quick. Are you in Model UN? 

482
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:41,220
听好了安德鲁 你觉得卡尔顿橄榄球队是个笑话？ 
I got a reply for you, Andrew. You think Carleton football's a joke?

483
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:42,600
跟我们来一场 
Come play with us. 

484
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,000
4个字 你下辈子都进不了NFL  
Four words you will never hear from the NFL. 

485
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,200
谁想吃甜点？  
Who wants dessert?

486
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,900
进林肯中心呢？  
And from Lincoln Center?

487
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:20,561
好了今天就到这了  
Alright guys, get out of here.

488
00:45:20,696 --> 00:45:22,685
走前别玩了拿新谱子   
Pick up the new chart by the door on your way out.

489
00:45:22,782 --> 00:45:27,843
今晚9点整排练 在那之前练好了来   
Rehearsal 9PM sharp tonight, that's how long you have till then to learn it.

490
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:34,335
内曼 过来下  
Neyman, just come over here.

491
00:45:39,818 --> 00:45:41,164
看到标的节奏了么？ 
See the tempo marking on there?

492
00:45:42,688 --> 00:45:44,396
四分音符速度330  
Quarter note equals 330

493
00:45:45,657 --> 00:45:47,102
双倍摇摆  
That is a double-time swing.

494
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:49,357
你就是靠这个进来的对吧 
That's what got you in here right?

495
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:50,605
是啊 
Oh yeah.

496
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:56,741
和你一样 我最近碰到了另外一个小孩 
I recently stumbled across another kid

497
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:59,200
在排练室练双倍摇摆 
In the practice room working on his double time swing.

498
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:02,000
所以我想给他个机会 
So I'm gonna give him another shot.

499
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:03,178
我来晚了？  
Am I late?

500
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:05,061
来的刚好  
Perfect timing.

501
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,498
进来吧康纳利  
Come on in Connelly 

502
00:46:07,928 --> 00:46:08,827
你俩认识吧？ 
You two know each other right?

503
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:10,377
嗯嗯 拿苏乐队  
Yeah, yeah, Nassau band.  

504
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:11,860
你好啊安德鲁  
Hey, what's up Andrew.

505
00:46:12,385 --> 00:46:15,380
嗯 康纳利 我刚让内曼当临时核心 
Now Connelly I've made Neyman a temporary core.

506
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:19,771
但是马上就要比赛了 我只想保证一切都达到最高水准 
But with this competition coming up I just wannna make very sure this chart's in the best shape it can be.

507
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,868
是这个吧？
Yeah it's the one right here right?

508
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,659
我今天早上给他的谱子  
I gave Connelly the chart this morning.

509
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:29,300
现在给你俩个机会一起试试吧  
All you need to do now is to just give both of you a crack at it, alright?

510
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,728
内曼你先上吧 从头开始   
So Neyman go ahead jump on the kit we'll take it from the top.

511
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:33,330
好吧 
Ok.

512
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:39,003
别担心鼓点 把住节奏就好  
I don't want you to worry about the hits right now, just tempo.

513
00:46:39,104 --> 00:46:40,142
好 
Ok?

514
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,900
准别好了？ 
All set?

515
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:56,352
节奏有点问题  
Not quite my tempo.

516
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:59,387
-康纳利 -没事让我再试一遍  
-Connelly? -Ok, I'll take.. from the top.

517
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:02,500
-我能...  -不用了 让康纳利来吧  
-I can do... -No, we'll go with Connelly now.

518
00:47:08,945 --> 00:47:09,947
借用下？ 
Hey do you mind?

519
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:18,250
-准备好了？ -嗯  
-Ok? -Yeah

520
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:28,731
漂亮！  
Perfect Connelly

521
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,903
这就是我喜欢音乐室乐队的原因之一  
See this to me is the beauty of Studio Band.

522
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,325
一个替补走进来 谁能想到马上就成新核心了？   
You walk in here an alternate, who knows you could be the new core.

523
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:37,266
靠你是逗我呢么 
Oh my god, are you serious?

524
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:39,014
就这玩意儿？ 
That shit?

525
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:44,232
弗莱彻	
Fletcher.

526
00:47:46,224 --> 00:47:46,879
谢了哥们  
Thanks man.  

527
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,300
别理弗莱彻 他光打雷不下雨 
Don't worry about Fletcher, he's more bark than bite.

528
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:01,835
-Hey 我能打好这曲子  -现在不是时候  
-Hey look, I can play these charts.  -Now's not the time.

529
00:48:02,062 --> 00:48:05,000
-我能打  -我说了不是时候！
-I can play. -I said not now!

530
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:08,000
你要真他妈想当核心 靠本事挣去 
If you want the fucking part, earn it.

531
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:27,609
我直说了吧   
I'm just gonna lay it out there.

532
00:48:28,052 --> 00:48:29,671
我觉得我们不应该再在一起了  
This is why I don't think that we shouldn't be together.

533
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:32,957
我想了很久 
And I thought about it a lot.

534
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:35,041
接下来会是这样的：
 And this is what's gonna happen, ok?

535
00:48:35,114 --> 00:48:36,661
我会一直追求我所追求的   
I'm gonna keep pursuing what I'm pursuing

536
00:48:36,772 --> 00:48:40,224
所以在练鼓上花的时间会越来越多  
And because I'm doing that it's gonna take more and more of my time

537
00:48:40,305 --> 00:48:42,150
能陪你的时间只会越来越少 
And I'm not gonna be able to spend so much time with you.

538
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:44,523
而当我陪你的时候满脑子全是练鼓 
And when I do spend time with you, I'll be thinking about drumming.

539
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,008
爵士和乐谱 
I'll be thinking about Jazz and my charts and all that.

540
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:49,068
所以你迟早会讨厌我 
And because of that you're gonna start to resent me.

541
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:51,763
之后你会抱怨让我腾出更多时间来陪你  
And you're gonna tell me to ease up drumming, spend more time with you

542
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,081
因为你会越来越没安全感 
because you're not feeling importrant

543
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:55,020
但我做不到 
And I'm not gonna be able to do that.

544
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:57,575
而且只要你一开始说“少打点鼓”我肯定会开始烦你  
And I'll just start to resent you for even asking me to stop drumming.

545
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:59,437
再然后就只能彼此憎恶了 
And we'll just start to hate each other.

546
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:01,297
那就不好看了  
And it's gonna get very... it's gonna be ugly.

547
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:05,167
所以说长痛不如短痛 还是现在就分手吧  
And so... for those reasons, I'd rather just break it off clean.

548
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,297
因为我想更优秀 
Cuz I wanna be great.

549
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:19,051
你还不优秀么？ 
And you're not?

550
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,501
我想成为最伟大的之一  
I wanna be one of the greats.

551
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,586
但有我你就成不了？  
And I'll stop you from doing that?

552
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:29,196
嗯 
Yeah.

553
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,425
你知道有我你就成不了 你就这么确定这是既定事实么？ 
You know I'll stop you from doing that. You know that for a fact.

554
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:37,514
是的  
Yes.

555
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,000
即使我几乎没怎么见到过你  
And I barely see you anyway

556
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:47,713
-嗯  -好不容易见到了你也爱理不理的 
-Yeah -And when I did see you you treated me like shit

557
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:49,980
因为我是个不知道自己要什么的女孩 
because I'm just some girl who doesn't know what she wants

558
00:49:50,096 --> 00:49:54,000
你有理想 你能成功 我只会被人遗忘 
And you have a path, and you're going to be great, and I'm gonna be forgotten

559
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,762
所以你不可能有空陪我 
And therefore, you won't be able to give me the time and day

560
00:49:56,849 --> 00:49:59,200
因为你有更宏远的追求 
because you have bigger things to pursue.

561
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:02,935
跟我想说的一模一样  
That's exactly my point.

562
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:04,842
你他妈的有病么？ 
What the fuck is wrong with you?

563
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,000
你说的对 我们不该再在一起了 
You're right, we should not be dating.

564
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:18,798
不用了谢谢  
I'm ok, thanks.

565
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,336
操！操！ 
Fuck! Fuck!  

566
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,381
操你妈的傻逼！ 
Fucking piece of shit!

567
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:56,399
操你妈的！操！ 
Fuck you! Fuck!

568
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:16,013
抱歉 新来了个鼓手  
Sorry we have a new player  

569
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:17,620
瑞安.康纳利  
Ryan Connelly

570
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:23,436
不好意思 
I'm sorry.

571
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:26,659
先把乐器放一边吧 
Can you just... put your instruments down, for a minute?

572
00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:41,632
听一分钟 
Just listen for a minute.

573
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,766
六年前  
Six years ago

574
00:51:50,382 --> 00:51:54,076
我在练琴室碰到了一个正在调音阶的孩子  
I came across a kid in the practice room working on his scales

575
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:56,331
刚上大二 
He was early second year

576
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,125
怀揣着希望来到谢尔佛 
and he started in Shaffer with a lot of hope

577
00:52:02,015 --> 00:52:03,238
和你们一样 
Like all you guys.

578
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,439
但事实是... 他差点都没能进来 
but the truth was... He barely squeezed in to begin with and..

579
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,500
那段日子对他很痛苦  
He was really struggling.

580
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:22,206
老师们都劝他 或许你真的不是搞音乐的料  
The faculty were all telling him, maybe this isn't for you.

581
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,469
但他们没有看到我所看到的 
But they didn't see what I saw.

582
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:29,073
那个瘦小的、担惊受怕的男孩 
That scared, skinny kid, 

583
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,645
因为音阶对不准而咒骂自己  
cursing himself because he couldn't get the scales right.

584
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:36,200
我看到的 是他内心无法遏制的冲劲   
I saw a drive in him.

585
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:37,802
于是我把他招进了音乐室乐队 
And I put him in Studio Band.

586
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,950
等到毕业时 
When he graduated

587
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:43,334
成了林肯中心的三席号手 
made him the third trumpet in Lincoln Center.

588
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,000
一年之后他已经是首席了 
A year later he was the first.

589
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:49,000
你们现在听到的就是他 
And that's what you're listening to now.

590
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:51,956
他的名字叫肖恩.凯西  
His name was Sean Casey.  

591
00:53:00,546 --> 00:53:04,080
今天早上我得知 肖恩... 
I found out this morning that... Sean  

592
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,505
昨天出车祸... 
died yesterday. 

593
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:13,110
死了  
in a car accident.

594
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:18,278
我只想...  
And I just...

595
00:53:20,478 --> 00:53:24,000
让你们知道 他是一个动人出色的乐手 
want you guys to know he was a beautiful player.

596
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,300
我只是觉得应该让你们知道  
I just thought you should know.

597
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,050
抱歉 
I'm sorry.

598
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,325
好了 
Ok.

599
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:50,854
开工吧 
Let's get to work, how about... 

600
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,527
Caravan  105小节  
Caravan, bar 105

601
00:54:03,062 --> 00:54:04,000
一 二 走  
One and two and

602
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:11,462
康纳利 你那有点问题  
It's not... not quite right Connelly

603
00:54:13,154 --> 00:54:14,373
让内曼试试吧 
I'd like to try Neyman on this.

604
00:54:19,788 --> 00:54:21,971
或许现在是内曼挣回核心的时候了 
Maybe now is the time for Neyman to earn the part

605
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:26,895
一 二 走 
One and two and

606
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:31,439
嗯 还是算了吧 
No, I guess not.

607
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:33,141
坦纳 
Tanner

608
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:44,874
一 二 走 
One and two and

609
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:46,996
操你妈的！ 
Motherfucker!

610
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:51,500
康纳利给我滚上去！ 
Connelly get your ass back on the kit  

611
00:54:58,688 --> 00:55:01,933
今晚你们仨娘炮里出不了一个能按节奏打的咱就不回家了
We'll stay here for as long as it takes till one of faggots can play in time.

612
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:04,036
一 二 走 
One and two and

613
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:09,000
看来得通宵了 内曼 
looks like it'll be all night. Neyman.

614
00:55:10,837 --> 00:55:12,427
一 二 走 
One and two and

615
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:15,432
妈逼节奏不对！ 
Not my fucking tempo!

616
00:55:18,578 --> 00:55:20,078
对不住了大家 要让你们这么等着 
Sorry guys, hate to put you through this

617
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:26,500
如果你要上大号喝咖啡什么的 
If you need to fucking take a dump or get a coffee whatever

618
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:27,445
最好现在去 
now might be a good time

619
00:55:27,605 --> 00:55:30,426
找不到能按节奏打的鼓手前谁都别想回家 
because we're gonna stay here until I find a drummer who can fucking play in time

620
00:55:31,424 --> 00:55:33,500
先给你们道个歉 
I apologize to the musicians.

621
00:55:33,976 --> 00:55:36,363
真的 休息10分钟 20分钟 1个小时 
Seriously, take ten, twenty, a fucking hour 

622
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,212
听见了么小逼崽子？
You hear me cocksuckers?

623
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,460
你们最好趁早给我打出完美的400拍 
You better start shitting me perfect 400

624
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:42,321
康纳利给我滚到鼓架上
Connelly get your fucking ass back on the kit

625
00:55:57,614 --> 00:56:01,234
你就只能打这么快了么 屁用没有的犹太逼 
This is really the fastest you can play, you worthless himey fuck?

626
00:56:01,668 --> 00:56:04,605
怪不得你妈不要你了 滚一边去 
No wonder mommy ran out on you. Get off the fucking kit.

627
00:56:07,987 --> 00:56:12,389
有请上西区的基佬先生 
And here comes Mr. Gay pride of the Upper Western side himself

628
00:56:13,224 --> 00:56:17,328
可惜这不是贝蒂.米勒的演唱会 我们不送火焰冰激凌和大都会鸡尾酒  
Unfortunately this is not a Bette Midler Concert, we'll not be serving Cosmopolitan and Baked Alaska

629
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:20,500
所以撸你男朋友的时候有多快你就给我打多快   
So just play faster than you give fucking hand jobs, will you please?

630
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:21,937
一 二 一 二  
One two one two

631
00:56:25,612 --> 00:56:26,600
差的太他妈远了 
Not even fucking close

632
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:29,127
轮到爱尔兰猪登场了 
Let's go with the Irish mick fucking paddy-cracker now

633
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:31,903
你真他妈太像小妖精了  
You... you actually do look quite a bit like a leprechaun 

634
00:56:32,796 --> 00:56:35,200
现在开始我就叫你爱尔兰妞吧  
I'll start calling you Flannery

635
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:55,493
滚！ 
Get off!

636
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:01,846
你他妈看屁呢 地上又没金子  
What the fuck you looking... there's not a pot of gold down there

637
00:57:01,957 --> 00:57:03,383
哦调座位啊 你逗我？ 
Oh adjusting the seat, really?!

638
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,714
折腾半天问题就是座位高度是么 
That's been your fucking problem the whole time? The seat height?

639
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,500
那现在你能打好了对吧？
So now you have it right?

640
00:57:08,296 --> 00:57:08,880
走 
Go.

641
00:57:15,004 --> 00:57:16,263
扯你妈蛋！傻逼！ 
Bullshit! Fuck you!

642
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:17,965
内曼  
Neyman.

643
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:26,472
或许 终于是时候画上个句号了 你说呢 
Maybe, it's time to finally bring this home, what do you say?

644
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,000
给我看看 
Show me.

645
00:57:33,063 --> 00:57:34,150

00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:38,275

别停！ 
Keep playing! 

653
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:28,866
别停！ 
Keep playing!

654
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,300
内曼   
Neyman

655
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:52,751
你挣回核心了 
You earned the part.

656
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:59,000
替补们 给我把鼓架上的血擦干净 
Alternates, you wanna clean the blood off my drum set?

Give yourself at least two hours to get there from the city this time alright?

660
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,556
记得留大巴收据  
Save your travel receipts.

661
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:36,665
或者扔了 关我屁事 
Or no, I don't give a shit.

662
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Dunellen比赛日

663
01:00:40,444 --> 01:00:42,125
抱歉打扰下 您知道出租车在哪儿么？
Excuse me, do you know where the cabs are?

664
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:44,549
-你得打电话叫  -他们说出租车在这接人？ 
-You have to call the cabs. -I konw, they say the cabs suppose to be right here?

665
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:46,462
没有啊 你得打电话叫才行 要等很久 
No you gotta call them, it'll take forever.

666
01:00:46,536 --> 01:00:48,200

-Fletcher got Connelly warming up... -God fucking damnit!

You just tell that little fucking redhead I'm gonna be there ok?

674
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:29,395

哦亲爱的 难得你挤出时间过来了 
Glad you finished on your busy schedule, darling.

677
01:01:36,434 --> 01:01:38,508
我知道 对不起 我来了准备上场吧 
I know. Look, I'm sorry, but I'm here man, ready to go.

678
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,000
今天康纳利是核心  
Connelly's playing the part.

679
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,100
去他妈的康纳利核心 
Like fucking hell he's playing my part.

680
01:01:41,106 --> 01:01:43,500
你他妈再给我说一遍？ 
What the fuck did you just say to me?

681
01:01:45,423 --> 01:01:46,571
我是核心  
It's my part.

682
01:01:47,327 --> 01:01:49,539
核心是我的 我想给谁就给谁  
It's my part, and I decide who to lend it to.

683
01:01:50,689 --> 01:01:52,493
一般会给带鼓槌的人 
Usually to somebody that has fucking sticks.

684
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,265
我忘车里了 马上回来 
I left in the car, I'll be right back

685
01:01:56,406 --> 01:01:59,300
-5分钟  -已经开始热身了  
-Take me 5 minutes. -I'm warming up the band now.

686
01:01:59,388 --> 01:02:02,379
-我就不能用下瑞安的鼓槌么.. -内曼 核心不是你了  
-Look I can use Ryan's sticks -Neyman you lost the fucking part

687
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:04,453
操怎么就不是我了 你不能这么干！ 
No I didn't, look you can't fucking do this to me!

688
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,388
-不能？！ -不能！  
-Can't?! -Yeah!

689
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,112
什么时候轮到你他妈来教育我能干什么不能干什么了？ 
When did you become a fucking expert on what I can or cannot do?

690
01:02:08,169 --> 01:02:09,856
平胸柴火妞 
You fucking weepy-willow shit sack?

691
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:11,022
核心是我挣来的 
I earned that part.

692
01:02:11,142 --> 01:02:13,764
你什么都没挣过 我操你他妈真是个自以为是的贱逼 
You never earned anything. God you're a self-righteous prick

693
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:17,396
你当上核心全是因为你弄丢了谱子 
The only reason you are a fucking core is because you misplaced folder.

694
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,000
你能进音乐室乐队全是以为你在拿苏的时候 
The only reason you're in Studio Band to begin with is because I told you

695
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
我就清清楚楚告诉你我要找的是什么 
exactly what I'd be asking for in Nassau 

696
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,500
-我错了么？ -没  
-Am I wrong?  -Yeah

697
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,000
-我能进音乐室乐队 是因为... -你就认了不行么  
-I'm in Studio Band, cause I'm the.. -Why don't you just back off?!

698
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
滚你妈的 老老实实给我翻乐谱去小婊子  
Hey you, fuck off Johnny Utah, turn my pages bitch!

699
01:02:30,419 --> 01:02:32,536
Hey 我他妈想什么时候让你滚你就得滚 
Hey, I can cut you any fucking time I want.

700
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,797
你离不开我 
You wouldn't cut me by now.

701
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,700
你试试看啊软逼！ 
Try me you fucking weasel!  

702
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:41,300
5点半 还剩整整11分钟 我的乐队就要上台了 
At 5.30, that's exactly 11 minutes, my band is on stage.

703
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:44,213
那之前要是你没有带着鼓槌回来 
If your ass is not on that stool with your own fucking sticks in hand

704
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:46,328
或者你他妈敢给我打错一拍 
Or you make one fucking mistake

705
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:47,487
错一拍 
One

706
01:02:47,609 --> 01:02:52,900
我立马送你回拿苏给人翻谱子翻到毕业或者退学！ 
I'll drum your ass back to Nassau where you can turn pages untill you graduate or fucking drop off.

707
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:56,726
等你从谢尔佛滚蛋的时候你爸看着都比你成功 
By the time you are done at Shaffer, you're gonna make daddy look like a fucking successful story

708
01:02:56,832 --> 01:02:57,567
懂？
Got it?

709
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,599
或者 让康纳利做核心 你选 
Or, we can let Johnny Utah play the part. You choose.

710
01:03:01,169 --> 01:03:02,563
那是我的核心 我会上台的 
It's my part, I'll be on your stage.

711
01:03:02,865 --> 01:03:07,188
操... 十分钟！他妈的娘炮臭基佬
Fuck... you got ten minutes you fucking pathetic pansy-ass fruit-fuck

712
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:19,782
-给弗莱彻说我马上到  -怎么这么久啊你 要上台了都 
-Hey tell Fletcher I'm coming. -What took you so long man, we're moving on stage right now.

713
01:03:19,892 --> 01:03:22,992
我知道 车锁出了点问题 
I know I got locked in my car. It's fine, I'm coming.

714
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:24,848
“200尺后左转”  
"Left turn, 200 feet"

715
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:26,108
你开车呢？
Are you driving man?

716
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:28,137
-没 -那那是什么声音？ 
-No -What the hell is that noise?

717
01:03:28,482 --> 01:03:33,000
靠你就告诉弗莱彻 我他妈马上到了!  
Ok look why don't you just tell Fletcher, that I am coming you motherfucker!

718
01:04:16,736 --> 01:04:17,463
你还好么？ 
Are you ok?

719
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:20,421
-你还好么？ -嗯我的鼓槌... 
-Are you ok? -Yeah I gotta get my sticks. 

720
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,025
别别别离车远点  
No no no no, stay away from the car.

721
01:04:23,182 --> 01:04:25,022
-我马上打911  -就几条街 
-I'm calling 911, it's ok. -Just a couple more blocks.

722
01:04:25,187 --> 01:04:26,533
先生，你不用... 
Sir, you don't have to...

723
01:05:07,472 --> 01:05:09,341
谢尔佛音乐学院 音乐室乐队

内曼你他妈想什么呢？ 
Neyman, what the fuck?

725
01:06:46,483 --> 01:06:47,307
内曼  
Neyman

726
01:06:50,744 --> 01:06:52,027
你玩完了  
You're done.

727
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:07,416
女士们先生们 我代表谢尔佛音乐学院表示歉意  
Gentlemen and ladies, I apologize on behalf of Shaffer Conservatory.

728
01:07:12,831 --> 01:07:14,371
我他妈弄死你！  
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

729
01:07:15,528 --> 01:07:17,000
别碰我！
Get off me!

730
01:07:24,114 --> 01:07:24,952
Fuck you!

731
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:27,217
Fuck you Fletcher Fuck you!

732
01:07:27,741 --> 01:07:30,218
操你妈的傻逼！ 
You fuck... piece of shit!

733
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:31,561
Fuck you!

734
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:48,414
你什么时候找到她的  
When did you start talking to her?

735
01:07:48,555 --> 01:07:50,506
我们是这周联系到你父亲的  
Your father got contacted this week.

736
01:07:51,263 --> 01:07:53,368
你知道肖恩.凯西么？ 
Does the name Sean Casey mean anything to you?

737
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:55,922
你知道他的死讯么？ 
Do you know about his death?

738
01:07:57,005 --> 01:07:59,500
上个月他在公寓里上吊自尽了 
Last month he hung himself in his apartment.

739
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:05,773
这和我有什么关系？ 
What's that have to do with me?

740
01:08:06,177 --> 01:08:08,379
肖恩患有长期焦虑抑郁症  
Sean suffered from anxiety and depression.

741
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:11,900
他母亲说这是在跟了弗莱彻之后开始的  
His mother claimed this started during his time as Fletcher's student.

742
01:08:12,741 --> 01:08:15,800
肖恩家里条件不是很好 他们也不打算提出诉讼 
Now Caseys aren't wealthy, they don't wanna file suit

743
01:08:18,215 --> 01:08:20,905
那...他们想要什么 
So... what do they want?

744
01:08:21,595 --> 01:08:25,365
确保不会再有学生遭到弗莱彻的虐待 
To make sure that Terrance Fletcher's never allowed to do this to another student

745
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
...从谢尔佛开除...

746
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,677
他什么都没做 
He didn't do anything.

747
01:08:57,677 --> 01:09:00,164
你怎么了？都结束了好么 
What's wrong with you? It's over ok?

748
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,721
他不会再出现在你生命中了 你为什么要放过他？ 
He's out of your life, why would you let him get away with what he did to you?

749
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,350
你觉得他的教学方式是否太过极端？
Would you characterize his conduct as extreme Andrew?

750
01:09:06,218 --> 01:09:09,685
他是否有在精神上蓄意折磨你？
Did he ever intentionally inflict emotional distress?

751
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:20,902
这案子不会有公开听证会  
This will not be a public hearing, you know?

752
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:23,454
弗莱彻永远不会知道是你说的 
Fletcher will never know it was you who spoke up.

753
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,277
你为什么要逼我  
Why would you do this to me?

754
01:09:32,373 --> 01:09:36,407
你真以为我会让他这样折磨完我儿子后  
Do you think that I would let him put my son through hell

755
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:38,647
大摇大摆走人么？
And just walk away scot-free?

756
01:09:38,793 --> 01:09:40,885
你不知道这是我绝对无法容忍的么？
Don't you know I would never let that happen?

757
01:09:41,355 --> 01:09:45,037
这世界上没有什么对我比你更重要的了  
That there is nothing in the world more important to me than you?

758
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,500
你还不知道么？
Don't you know that?

759
01:09:58,346 --> 01:09:59,267
安德鲁？ 
Andrew?

760
01:10:45,147 --> 01:10:46,068
安德鲁？ 
Andrew?

761
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,151
告诉我该怎么说吧 
Just tell me what to say.

762
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
夏

763
01:11:44,061 --> 01:11:47,716
-Hey 我给你壁橱里留了点零食  -我看到了  
-Hi, and... I loaded your pantry with Gushers. -I saw that.

764
01:11:52,222 --> 01:11:53,311
谢谢 
Thanks

765
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:43,511
爵士现场... 特邀嘉宾：泰伦斯.弗莱彻

安德鲁 
Andrew

767
01:14:34,277 --> 01:14:35,395
Hey

768
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:43,552
不知道你听说了没 
Don't know if you heard...

769
01:14:45,124 --> 01:14:46,850
我不在谢尔佛了 
I'm not in Shaffer any more.

770
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:49,520
嗯... 我听说了 
Yeah I did hear that.

771
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:51,843
你辞职了？ 
Did you quit?

772
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:55,286
不是 
Not exactly.

773
01:14:57,418 --> 01:15:00,845
有和肖恩一届的学生家长... 
Some parents got a kid from Sean Casey's year I think

774
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,590
说了些关于我的话 
to say somethings about me.

775
01:15:04,426 --> 01:15:09,500
我以为除了阿谀奉承意外 大家最多也就会说我比较神秘吧 
Although why anybody would have anything other than peaches and cream to say about me is a mystery.

776
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:14,897
很好笑吧 
That's a good laugh right?

777
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,633
-不好意思  -别 我懂  
-I'm sorry. -No I get it.

778
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:19,381
我知道我树了不少敌  
I know I've made enemies.

779
01:15:20,968 --> 01:15:22,277
不过我还在指挥  
I'm conducting though

780
01:15:24,418 --> 01:15:26,779
今年的JVC音乐节请我回去了 
They brought back JVC fest this year

781
01:15:27,503 --> 01:15:30,500
过两周会带一支专业乐队去做开场表演 
They got me opening in a couple of weeks with a pro band.

782
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:32,501
挺好的啊 
That's great.

783
01:15:34,598 --> 01:15:35,809
还行吧 
It's alright.

784
01:15:38,405 --> 01:15:40,087
说实话 我觉得人们... 
Truth is, I don't think people...

785
01:15:40,909 --> 01:15:45,802
根本不知道我在谢尔佛做的是什么 
understood what it was I was doing at Shaffer.

786
01:15:45,905 --> 01:15:46,897
我不是去指挥的 
I wasn't there to conduct.

787
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,808
弱智也会摇摇胳膊控制节奏 
Any fucking moron can wave his arms and keep people in tempo.

788
01:15:51,228 --> 01:15:54,995
我是去逼他们突破自己的极限的 
I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them

789
01:15:57,557 --> 01:15:59,711
我相信... 
I believe that is... 

790
01:16:00,838 --> 01:16:03,139
这是绝对不可或缺的
an absolute necessity.

791
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:08,000
不然只会浪费掉下一个路易.阿姆斯特朗 
otherwise we're depriving the world the next Louie Armstrong

792
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,502
下一个查理.帕克 
the next Charlie Parker.

793
01:16:11,553 --> 01:16:15,060
我给你讲过那个查理.帕克怎样成为查理.帕克的故事吧 
I told that story about how Charlie Parker became Charlie Parker

794
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:17,334
-乔.琼斯朝他脑袋上砸了个钵  -就是这样  
-Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head. -Exactly.

795
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:20,424
当时帕克还年轻 萨克斯吹的很好  
Parker was a young kid. Pretty good on the sax.

796
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,386
一路拼到淘汰赛 
Gets up to play in the cutting session 

797
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:24,387
然后玩砸了 
And he fucks it up.

798
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:28,036
乔.琼斯差点没把他脑袋削下来 
And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

799
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:30,939
回到后台受尽奚落 
and he's laughed off-stage 

800
01:16:31,874 --> 01:16:36,000
那晚上哭着入睡 但第二天起来 他做了什么？ 
crie himself to sleep that night, but the next moring, what does he do?

801
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,500
练琴 
he practices.

802
01:16:37,815 --> 01:16:41,093
练琴 还是练琴 心中只有一个目标 
and he practices and he practices, with one goal in mind

803
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:43,483
再也不能被任何人嘲笑 
never to be laughed at again.

804
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:47,200
一年后他回到舞台上 
And a year later he goes back to the Reno.

805
01:16:47,664 --> 01:16:53,000
吹出了有史以来最他妈牛逼的独奏 
And he steps up on that stage and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard.

806
01:16:56,097 --> 01:16:58,344
所以你想一下 如果琼斯只是说 
So imagine if Jones just said.

807
01:16:58,717 --> 01:17:00,284
“还可以查理” 
"Well that's ok Charlie"

808
01:17:00,463 --> 01:17:02,612
“挺好的 不错” 
"That was alright, good job."

809
01:17:04,388 --> 01:17:05,495
然后查理回去想 
and Charlie thinks to himself

810
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:07,979
“操 老子吹的不错啊” 
"Well, shit, I did a pretty good job."

811
01:17:09,206 --> 01:17:10,472
再就没有后续了 
End of story.

812
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:11,639
没有大鸟了
No bird.

813
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:17,229
对我来说那简直就是悲剧 
That to me is an absolute tragedy.

814
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,500
但是现在大家就只想要这样 
But that's just what the world wants now.

815
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:23,177
还都纳闷为什么爵士将死 
People wonder why Jazz is dying

816
01:17:28,153 --> 01:17:29,035
给你说吧哥们儿 
I tell you man

817
01:17:29,147 --> 01:17:33,873
你去看看每家星巴克里摆的爵士专辑就懂我意思了 
Every Starbucks' Jazz album just proved my point, really.

818
01:17:35,201 --> 01:17:37,841
英语里再没有哪两个字
There are no two words in English language

819
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:41,853
比“不错”更害人的了 
more harmful than "good job".

820
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,172
那就没有个界限了么？
But is there a line?

821
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:54,630
比如... 你逼的太狠 下一个查理.帕克反而气馁退出了 
You know maybe... you go to far, you discourage next Charlie Parker from ever becoming Charlie Parker?

822
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:56,933
不会的 怎么会？ 
No man, no.

823
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,173
因为下一个查理.帕克永远不会气馁 
Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged.

824
01:18:00,453 --> 01:18:01,389
嗯 
Yeah.

825
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:08,256
事实是 
The truth is, Andrew

826
01:18:10,822 --> 01:18:13,086
我从来没有过自己的查理.帕克 
I never really had a Charlie Parker.

827
01:18:16,538 --> 01:18:17,601
但我努力了  
But I tried.

828
01:18:19,007 --> 01:18:22,000
我他妈的是真努力了 
I actually fucking tried.

829
01:18:22,027 --> 01:18:24,000
这一点就已经比多数人走的远多了 
And that's  more than most people ever do.

830
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:29,000
而我永远不会为自己怎样努力过而道歉 
and I'll never apologize for how I tried.

831
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,193
嗯 回见了  
Alright, see you later.

832
01:18:45,209 --> 01:18:46,793
Hey 安德鲁  
Hey Andrew

833
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:50,121
我不知道你会怎么想 但是... 
Listen I have no idea how you gonna take this, but...

834
01:18:51,475 --> 01:18:53,415
我带去JVC的这支乐队 
the band I'm leading for JVC

835
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:55,721
鼓手还是差口气 
The drummer's not cutting it.

836
01:18:57,318 --> 01:18:58,748
懂我意思么？ 
You understand what I'm saying?

837
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:04,400
-不懂  -我用的都是音乐室乐队的曲目 
-No. -I'm using the Studio Band playlist.

838
01:19:04,789 --> 01:19:07,136
Caravan Whiplash 
Caravan Whiplash 

839
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:11,200
我得找个把谱子吃透的 
I need somebody who really knows these charts.

840
01:19:14,145 --> 01:19:16,085
瑞安.康纳利呢  
What about Ryan Connelly?

841
01:19:17,287 --> 01:19:20,132
他一直都是我用来激发你动力的而已 
Ryan Connelly ever was to me is an incentive for you.

842
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:22,159
坦纳？ 
Tanner?

843
01:19:22,295 --> 01:19:23,798
坦纳转学医了 
Tanner switched to premed

844
01:19:24,849 --> 01:19:27,000
应该是气馁了吧 
Guess he got discouraged.

845
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:33,009
周末回去考虑考虑吧 
Hey, take the weekend, think about it.

846
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,526
-你好？ -你好妮可 是安德鲁 
-Hello? -Hey Nicole, it's Andrew.

Been a while since...

849
01:20:06,346 --> 01:20:07,702
没跟你聊天了  
I talked to you

850
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:09,174
嗯... 我就是想说...

851
01:20:10,635 --> 01:20:12,231
真的对不起  
I'm really sorry

852
01:20:13,043 --> 01:20:17,083

It's a... JVC thing, I don't know maybe if you wanna go	

856
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,520
在卡耐基剧院 演出完可以一起去吃个匹萨 
it's in Carnegie Hall and.. we.. maybe get some like.. pizza afterwards

857
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:43,500
抱怨下学校里那点事... 什么的

858
01:20:44,315 --> 01:20:46,402
那是... JV？  
What... is that JV?

859
01:20:46,645 --> 01:20:52,080
不是 是JVC 那个... 是爵士乐...啦  
No it's JVC, it's like a.. it's Jazz... thing.

860
01:20:59,129 --> 01:21:01,206
嗯... 我不知道哎  
Ugh... I don't know if I can come.

861
01:21:01,316 --> 01:21:04,642
我得问下我男朋友 
I have to check with my boyfriend.

862
01:21:08,754 --> 01:21:10,134
好吧 
Ok

863
01:21:10,281 --> 01:21:11,589
行 
Yeah

864
01:21:12,973 --> 01:21:17,737
我会问他的 但是我觉得他... 估计对爵士没什么兴趣 
I'll check, but I don't know that... he's into Jazz, so...

865
01:21:17,836 --> 01:21:19,678
嗯对 不是人人都喜欢的 
Yeah I mean, not for everybody.

866
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:26,349
好吧 那就到时候见吧 
Ok, well I guess maybe I'll see you guys there.

底下的观众一个电话

就考虑换行吧 
you might be looking for a new line of work because

879
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:17,239
因为这些人的另一个特点 
the other thing about these cats is

880
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,042
是过目不忘
