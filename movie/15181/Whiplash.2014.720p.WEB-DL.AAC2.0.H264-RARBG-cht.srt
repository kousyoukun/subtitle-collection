00:48:35,114 --> 00:48:36,661
我壹直追求我所追求的   
I'm gonna keep pursuing what I'm pursuing

536
00:48:36,772 --> 00:48:40,224
所以在鼓上花的rg越碓蕉  
And because I'm doing that it's gonna take more and more of my time

537
00:48:40,305 --> 00:48:42,150
能陪的rg只越碓缴 
And I'm not gonna be able to spend so much time with you.

538
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:44,523
而我陪的r候MX子全是鼓 
And when I do spend time with you, I'll be thinking about drumming.

539
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,008
爵士和纷V 
I'll be thinking about Jazz and my charts and all that.

540
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:49,068
所以t早我 
And because of that you're gonna start to resent me.

541
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:51,763
之後抱怨我v出更多rg砼  
And you're gonna tell me to ease up drumming, spend more time with you

542
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,081
因越碓]安全感 
because you're not feeling importrant

543
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:55,020
但我做不到 
And I'm not gonna be able to do that.

544
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:57,575
而且只要壹_始f“少打c鼓”我肯定_始  
And I'll just start to resent you for even asking me to stop drumming.

545
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:59,437
再然後就只能彼此憎毫 
And we'll just start to hate each other.

546
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:01,297
那就不好看了  
And it's gonna get very... it's gonna be ugly.

547
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:05,167
所以fL痛不如短痛 是F在就分手吧  
And so... for those reasons, I'd rather just break it off clean.

548
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,297
因槲蚁敫秀 
Cuz I wanna be great.

549
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:19,051
不秀麽？ 
And you're not?

550
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,501
我想成樽ゴ蟮闹壹  
I wanna be one of the greats.

551
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,586
但有我就成不了？  
And I'll stop you from doing that?

552
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:29,196
嗯 
Yeah.

553
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,425
知道有我就成不了 就@麽_定@是既定事麽？ 
You know I'll stop you from doing that. You know that for a fact.

554
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:37,514
是的  
Yes.

555
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,000
即使我缀]怎麽到^  
And I barely see you anyway

556
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:47,713
-嗯  -好不容易到了也劾聿焕淼 
-Yeah -And when I did see you you treated me like shit

557
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:49,980
因槲沂不知道自己要什麽的女孩 
because I'm just some girl who doesn't know what she wants

558
00:49:50,096 --> 00:49:54,000
有理想 能成功 我只被人z忘 
And you have a path, and you're going to be great, and I'm gonna be forgotten

559
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,762
所以不可能有空陪我 
And therefore, you won't be able to give me the time and day

560
00:49:56,849 --> 00:49:59,200
因有更宏h的追求 
because you have bigger things to pursue.

561
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:02,935
跟我想f的壹模壹  
That's exactly my point.

562
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:04,842
他的有病麽？ 
What the fuck is wrong with you?

563
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,000
f的 我不再在壹起了 
You're right, we should not be dating.

564
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:18,798
不用了xx  
I'm ok, thanks.

565
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,336
操！操！ 
Fuck! Fuck!  

566
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,381

567
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:56,399
操的！操！ 
Fuck you! Fuck!

568
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:16,013
抱歉 新砹鼓手  
Sorry we have a new player  

569
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:17,620
瑞安.康{利  
Ryan Connelly

570
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:23,436
不好意思 
I'm sorry.

571
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:26,659
先把菲鞣乓歼吧 
Can you just... put your instruments down, for a minute?

572
00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:41,632
壹分 
Just listen for a minute.

573
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,766
六年前  
Six years ago

574
00:51:50,382 --> 00:51:54,076
我在琴室碰到了壹正在{音A的孩子  
I came across a kid in the practice room working on his scales

575
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:56,331
上大二 
He was early second year

576
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,125
汛е希望淼街x佛 
and he started in Shaffer with a lot of hope

577
00:52:02,015 --> 00:52:03,238
和壹 
Like all you guys.

578
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,439
但事是... 他差c都]能M 
but the truth was... He barely squeezed in to begin with and..

579
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,500
那段日子λ很痛苦  
He was really struggling.

580
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:22,206
老都袼 或S真的不是搞音返牧  
The faculty were all telling him, maybe this isn't for you.

581
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,469
但他]有看到我所看到的 
But they didn't see what I saw.

582
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:29,073
那瘦小的、@受怕的男孩 
That scared, skinny kid, 

583
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,645
因橐綦AΣ识咒R自己  
cursing himself because he couldn't get the scales right.

584
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:36,200
我看到的 是他刃o法遏制的_   
I saw a drive in him.

585
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:37,802
於是我把他招M了音肥逢 
And I put him in Studio Band.

586
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,950
等到Ir

壹年之後他已是首席了 
A year later he was the first.

589
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:49,000

And he fucks it up.

798
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:28,036
.斯差c]把他X袋削下 
And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

799
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:30,939
回到後_受M奚落 
and he's laughed off-stage 

800
01:16:31,874 --> 01:16:36,000
那晚上哭著入睡 但第二天起 他做了什麽？ 
crie himself to sleep that night, but the next moring, what does he do?

801
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,500
琴 
he practices.

802
01:16:37,815 --> 01:16:41,093
琴 是琴 心中只有壹目 
and he practices and he practices, with one goal in mind

803
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:43,483
再也不能被任何人嘲笑 
never to be laughed at again.

804
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:47,200
壹年後他回到舞_上 
And a year later he goes back to the Reno.

805
01:16:47,664 --> 01:16:53,000
吹出了有史以碜钏牛逼的奏 
And he steps up on that stage and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard.

806
01:16:56,097 --> 01:16:58,344
所以想壹下 如果斯只是f 
So imagine if Jones just said.

807
01:16:58,717 --> 01:17:00,284
“可以查理” 
"Well that's ok Charlie"

808
01:17:00,463 --> 01:17:02,612
“挺好的 不e” 
"That was alright, good job."

809
01:17:04,388 --> 01:17:05,495
然後查理回去想 
and Charlie thinks to himself

810
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:07,979
“操 老子吹的不e啊” 
"Well, shit, I did a pretty good job."

811
01:17:09,206 --> 01:17:10,472
再就]有後m了

That to me is an absolute tragedy.

814
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,500
但是F在大家就只想要@ 
But that's just what the world wants now.

英ZY再]有哪字
There are no two words in English language

819
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:41,853
比“不e”更害人的了 
more harmful than "good job".

820
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,172
那就]有界限了麽？
But is there a line?

821
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:54,630
比如... 逼的太狠 下壹查理.帕克反而怵H退出了 
You know maybe... you go to far, you discourage next Charlie Parker from ever becoming Charlie Parker?

822
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:56,933
不的 怎麽？ 
No man, no.

823
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,173
因橄乱查理.帕克永h不怵H
