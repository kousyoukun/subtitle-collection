00:00:31,482 --> 00:00:33,415
<i>Die, scum!</i>

2
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,928
Rico, what's the matter with these guys?

3
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,999
Come on, get the works going.

4
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,267
We gotta get the hell out of here.

5
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:34,771
Yes.

6
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:37,772
You know, you're late, Tommy.

7
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,006
Rico. Relax.

8
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:41,207
Okay, Benny. Okay.

9
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,042
You're the boss.
Come on.

10
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:44,576
That's Hugo porto's mob?

11
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:46,611
Yeah. They tried to move in
on big sep's territory

12
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,245
down in Atlantic city.

13
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:50,547
Killed Victor viking's mom in the process.

14
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,415
Wow! What a bunch
of scumbags?

15
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,949
Whatever.

16
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:55,083
And there's proof for big sep

17
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:56,651
and a ticket on the redeye.

18
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:58,719
The heads are nice and clean
and ready to go, okay?

19
00:01:58,721 --> 00:01:59,721
Okay.

20
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,354
Hey, Tommy,

21
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:02,822
big sep's hot.

22
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:05,024
I'm two weeks late delivering the meat.

23
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:07,259
If he doesn't get that by noon tomorrow,

24
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,160
more heads are gonna roll,
you know what I mean?

25
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,361
No problem.

26
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,598
<i>¶ Do you love me?</i>

You take care.
You have a good trip now.

36
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:37,182
Hi.
Hi. Checking that one?

37
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,583
Yeah.
All right. Ticket, sir?

38
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:39,784
Here you go.

39
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,185
All right.
Where you headed?

40
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:42,419
San Diego?

41
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,787
Mexico. Eventually.

42
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:44,988
You have a good flight.

43
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,122
Thanks a lot.
All right.

44

51
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:02,466
hey, how're you doing?

52
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:07,069
That goes way... on top.

53
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,103
Come here.

54
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,671
Up, up..

55
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:11,539
That's not going to fit.

56
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:13,807
Here.

57
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:15,408
It's just that this thing...

58
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,542
There.

59
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:17,643
Thank you. Thanks.

60
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,490
Ma'am, will you step over here, please?

61
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:34,624
Got to check your pockets...

62
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,258
Got a gun!
She got a gun?

63
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,826
Get it away from her!

64
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:39,594
Get her hand!
Get her hand! Over here!

65
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:41,128
Ouch! Please!

66
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:45,564
I don't own a gun!

67
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,599
Ma'am, stop struggling. Be a lot easier.

68
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,774
Yes...

69
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:06,748
Hey, kid, is this yours?

70
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,015
Yeah.

71
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,016
Yeah. Do me a favor,
will you?

72
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:10,384
Put that right under the seat,

73
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:12,085
and see maybe if you can keep that with you.

74
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,520
Because I got some important
stuff in this bag.

75
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:16,121
I'd like to keep it close by me.

76
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,488
You know what I mean?

77
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,291
Thanks.

78
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,592
That's really nice of you.

79
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:25,127
Good kid. Thank you.

80
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:26,929
Okay.

81
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,233
Attaboy. It fits
right under there.

82
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:35,635
No, it doesn't fit right under there.

83
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:37,103
Maybe you'll get a little
spot in another bin.

84
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,205
Thanks. I appreciate that.
It's nice of you.

85
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:04,661
Excuse me.

86
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,496
Careful. Careful.

87
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:13,767
I almost didn't make it.

88
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,535
I'm sure someone's glad you did.

89
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:17,136
Let's see. 49-c.

90
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:18,437
It's right down this way.

91
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,871
Okay. Thanks.

92
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,641
49-c, sir.
It's right here.

93
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:28,877
Baby stuff.

94
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,045
Let me see...

95
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,447
Excuse me, sir.
Is this yours?

96
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,748
Yeah.

97
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,783
I'm sorry. We'll need
to use this compartment.

98
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:39,384
Would you mind using another one?

99
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:42,453
Because I have valuable
family heirlooms in there.

100
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,221
Okay... Sir, as you can plainly see,

101
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:45,789
this is an emergency situation.

102
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,791
Maybe you can use somebody else's bin.

103
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:50,059
I mean, this kid's not using all of his.
Would you mind if...

104
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,061
Hey, excuse me, but screw you.

105
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:54,129
Hey, hey, come on, be nice.

106
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,597
Be a gentleman, will you?

107
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,432
We're trying to help over here.
Let me help you.

108
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,000
Look, pal, this goes right under here.

109
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,801
Wait.
No, this is small.

110
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:02,369
That's okay. Thanks.
Don't... don't...

111
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:03,837
What... wait, don't kick it!

112
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,072
For God's sake!
Those are live human organs!

113
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,273
Excuse me, sir!

114
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:09,475
Trust me, pal.
They don't feel it.

115
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:12,744
Would you sit down, please?

116
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,313
Here you go, sir.
I'm really sorry about that.

117
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:17,914
Sir, we're gonna have to use your bin.

118
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,649
Excuse me. But...

119
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:21,984
And actually, sir, I think your
bag is over the size limit.

120
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,285
Well, no, because, see,

121
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:24,953
the guy outside measured this,

122
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:26,321
and he said that it was okay.

123
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,222
Sir, it's clearly over the size limit.

124
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:29,923
It will have to go in cargo.

125
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,491
Listen, wait a minute, wait a minute.

126
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,526
Hold on. Hold on a second.
Listen.

127
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,296
Maybe we could just leave
my bag where it is,

128
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:38,730
all right?

129
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,098
Are you trying to bribe me, sir?

130
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,467
No. I'm trying to purchase
a place for my bag...

131
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,136
The place for your bag is in cargo, sir.

132
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,272
Excuse me. Maybe I'll
just take another flight.

133
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,174
Fine. The next flight to San
Diego leaves in 7 hours, sir.

134
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,708
Well, let me make a phone call.

135
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,243
Sir, do you actually think that
we're gonna hold the plane

136
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,811
while you use the phone?

137
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,845
Now, are you flying with us tonight or not?

138
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:02,447
All right, miss Burke.
Yes?

139
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,815
That's your name, right?
Yes.

140
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:05,550
This bag better be in San Diego.

141
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:07,351
You're gonna be in a lot
of trouble if it's not.

142
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,553
Yes, sir. It will be
the very first off the plane.

143
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,021
Does that make you happy?

144
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,956
When it's there, then I'll be happy. Okay.

145
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,691
Have a seat, please.
Thank you.

146
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,795
Happy?

147
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,263
Happy? Yeah, I'm happy.

148
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,564
I'm thrilled.

149
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:23,665
Happy.

150
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:26,400
What are you looking at?

151
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,902
You started all this
with those frigging organs.

152
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:31,004
You're happy, right?
Happy!

153
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,839
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

154
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,140
<i>Or should I say good morning?</i>

155
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:36,108
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

156
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,076
<i>We're sorry for the delay,</i>

157
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:40,411
<i>but we should be moving
away from the gate...</i>

158
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,712
Look...

159
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,814
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

160
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:45,148
I'm Charlie.

161
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,822
So...
Where you headed?

162
00:07:53,824 --> 00:07:56,191
I'm going to meet my girlfriend's parents.

163
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:58,993
Yes.

164
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,694
She races these cars.

165
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:05,798
She's great.
She's just great.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,399
I wish her parents thought the same of me.

167
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm on my way to meet
them for the first time.

168
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:11,669
I haven't seen her in,
like, six months, and...

169
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:12,936
I'm gonna go to sleep.

170
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,604
Think about what you're
gonna say to them, okay?

171
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:17,006
Yeah. I don't know, because, I
mean, I haven't even met them,

172
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:19,441
already the father, he
doesn't like me, I know.

173
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:22,277
I could understand that. I just met
you, and I don't like you either.

174
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,479
I gotta sleep. Didn't you hear me? Come on.

175
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:26,681
I'm just trying to make conversation.

176
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:28,449
Good. Make it
in sign language.

177
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:44,397
Laurie?

178
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:53,038
Is something wrong?
No.

179
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,239
You look great.

180
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,406
Thanks.

181
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,975
What is the matter?

182
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:01,276
Nothing.
Let's talk about it later.

183
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,046
Okay.

184
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
No.

185
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,974
No, Jesus, please, no.

186
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:46,281
"Charlie pritchett"? Shoot!

187
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,548
What do you have in there?

188
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,383
It looks like you packed for a month.

189
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:51,485
You know me.
Ready for anything.

190
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,253
Boy.
Look at this loser.

191
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:56,456
Wooly... Be nice, now. Come on.

192
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,057
Charlie, these are my parents.

193
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:59,625
Annette and dick.

194
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,627
Annette. Charlie, it's a real pleasure.

195
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,762
Dick, very nice to meet you.

196
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:05,830
This is for you.

197
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:09,533
These wrappings
are beautiful. Thank you.

198
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,601
My God, dick.
I left yours on the plane.

199
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,669
No, no, no. Why don't you call the airline?

200
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:16,505
We got a long ride. We
gotta make tracks. Sorry.

201
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:19,140
Wudji, why don't you ride
shotgun with your dad?

202
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:20,307
"Wudji"?

203
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,676
Wudji like me to drive?

204
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:28,212
I think I can handle it.

205
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,216
No.

206
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:33,550
No. Jesus...

207
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:49,928
House of pain.

208
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,462
Yeah, hello, who's this?

209
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:54,398
This is qaddafi.
Who's this?

210
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,733
Qaddafi?
Listen...

211
00:10:56,735 --> 00:10:59,902
This is bill. I'm an old
friend of Charlie pritchett's.

212
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:02,304
I was wondering if you
could help me find him.

213
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:03,638
Yeah. He's gone
on spring break

214
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,072
with the rest of America.

215
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:06,540
Did you try looking in Mexico?

216
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,542
That's very funny.

217
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,577
Look, this is really important.

218
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,413
Do you think you could be a
little more specific, qaddafi?

219
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:15,047
<i>Not unless it's for a grade.</i>

220
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,615
Hey, bill, is it?

221
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:18,984
Tell me if this sounds
like a phone hanging up.

222
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:21,086
Yeah... shoot!

223
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:28,758
I need a flight to...

224
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,993
Bethesda university.

225
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:34,463
I'm not sure the university
has their own airport,

226
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:37,466
but we can fly you to Baltimore.
Will that do?

227
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:39,069
Hey, don't get cute with me, asshole?

228
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,085
Wake up, people, we're here.

229
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:00,352
Made it in record time.

230
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm famished.

231
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,921
Me, too.

232
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:07,223
Boy, could I use a Margarita.
What time is it?

233
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,658
1350 hours.

234
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,192
Bear,

235
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:13,427
remember what we agreed about your drinking?

236
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:15,295
You be a good bear.

237
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:16,396
Take one of your new pills.

238
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:18,264
They make me woozy, wooly.

239
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,698
Besides, I said I could use a drink.

240
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,067
I didn't say I'm having one.

241
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,570
Listen, there is absolutely
nothing in this whole world

242
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:26,971
that could ever,

243
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:29,373
ever make me take a drink again.

244
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,841
So relax, okay?

245
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:35,044
<i>Bienvenidos.</i>
Welcome back, <i>senor.</i>

246
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,112
<i>Hola,</i> Juan. You catch the big one this time.

247
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:45,751
<i>Benny? I ran
into a little delay here.</i>

248
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:46,918
What do you mean, a delay?

249
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,486
Excuse me, are you gonna be long?

250
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:50,421
A day, maybe two.
On the phone?

251
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:53,390
What? What the hell's
happened, Tommy?

252
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:55,925
<i>Hey, Benny, I can't go into it
right now, but it's gonna be okay.</i>

253
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:58,127
All right? I mean, can't
you talk to big sep?

254
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,895
<i>Big sep is riding me like a racehorse.</i>

255
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,096
<i>I told you we was late.</i>

256
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:02,597
Hey, listen, the job is finished.

257
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,398
What's the big deal with the delivery?

258
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,234
Tommy, you didn't lose nothing, did you?

259
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:09,970
Hey, Benny, you know how many
years I did this for your father?

260
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,172
How could you even ask me
something like that? Mister...

261
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,474
Hey, lady, you interrupt me one more time,

262
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,709
you're gonna swallow this phone.
Now get out of here.

263
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,143
Go ahead!
Take it on the heels!

264
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,446
One day.
You got one day, Tommy.

265
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:25,316
If big sep doesn't get those heads
in his hands by noon tomorrow,

266
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:27,551
you might as well chop off your own head

267
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:29,553
and put it in with the others. <i>Capisce?</i>

268
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:32,088
Don't worry about it, all right? He'll
have 'em before they start stinking.

269
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,256
Please.
Or you'll be stinking.

270
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:36,191
Yeah, yeah.
I know what you mean.

271
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:37,492
Well, it's about time.

272
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:39,894
Yeah, I know. Here.

273
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:41,095
It's all yours.

274
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:44,231
We've done a lot of redecorating...

275
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,498
Pepe.

276
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,932
Since you've been here, <i>senor.</i>

277
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:49,801
It's quite lovely.
We hope you enjoy it.

278
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:51,169
It's beautiful, isn't it, bear?

279
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,437
<i>Senor</i> pritchett, your room.

280
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:58,575
Thank you.
Minibar.

281
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,009
<i>El bano,</i> the bathroom.

282
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:01,977
If you need anything, please call me.

283
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,778
Everybody, unpack later.

284
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,547
They're only serving lunch
downstairs for 10 more minutes.

285
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,148
Yes, sir. No problem.
Good.

286
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,318
<i>Senor,</i> this is yours.
Come on, bear.

287
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,053
I'm coming, wooly.

288
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,988
It's 206.

289
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,657
Aw, can we keep the puppy, wooly?

290
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,696
Okay, Laurie, what's going on?

291
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,199
Nothing. Let's just talk
about it later, okay?

292
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:32,500
No. Let's talk
about it now.

293
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:36,837
Look, Charlie,

294
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,174
I don't know quite how to put this, but...

295
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:44,676
I think I want a divorce.

296
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:47,244
What?

297
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,178
A divorce?

298
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,580
We're not even married.
We're not even engaged.

299
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:53,281
You know what I mean.

300
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,416
That's why you invited me
here, to tell me this?

301
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:56,884
Why'd you invite me to meet your parents?

302
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:59,419
Well, I didn't really...
Actually invite you.

303
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:01,954
Excuse me, but...

304
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,989
You invited me to your parents' house,

305
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:06,858
and then you called and said
we're coming to Mexico instead.

306
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,559
When I said we were going to Mexico,

307
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,260
I didn't actually mean you.

308
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:12,028
What?

309
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,830
It was just supposed to be me and
my parents for my dad's birthday,

310
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,598
and you got so excited, I didn't...

311
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I didn't know how to break it to you.

312
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:23,905
Laurie, what's happened to you?

313
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:27,074
Six months at home and you've mutated

314
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,476
from a fun-loving
free spirit into...

315
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:32,611
Nancy Reagan.

316
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,714
Look, I just want stability
in my life, Charlie.

317
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:37,015
I need to be with someone

318
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,883
who really knows who they are,

319
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:41,886
and knows what they want in life.

320
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:43,654
You know what this is all about?

321
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:45,088
Your folks.

322
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,556
They don't like me,

323
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:48,824
and it's affecting the way
that you feel about me,

324
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:51,026
but just wait, Laurie.

325
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:52,660
My being here will turn out to be

326
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:54,228
a blessing in disguise.

327
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:57,730
I'm not giving up on you, Laurie.

328
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,766
Is my hair all right?
I'm open-minded.

329
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:03,367
It's just that he's such a dip!

330
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:05,836
Do you think he's a dip?
I think he's really cute,

331
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,537
and he seems funny, and he seems smart...

332
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,505
And, I mean, what do you want for, wooly?

333
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:11,807
I want what I was when I was his age.

334
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,442
I was charismatic...

335
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:16,043
Ambitious.

336
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:18,145
That's right. I was clearly
headed to the top.

337
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,346
Clearly, darling.

338
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:21,881
The very, very top.

339
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:25,384
I mean, we can be honest with each other

340
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:27,185
when we're alone, can't we?

341
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,853
I think that's a good idea, wooly.

342
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,855
I mean, I've always wanted to be...

343
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,623
I forgot something!

344
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,224
Will you go down and get us a table?

345
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,526
What's the problem? No problem.
I just forgot something,

346
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,327
and I'll be there in just a second, okay?

347
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:39,428
I'm running.

348
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:22,190
<i>Senorita,</i>
no, no. Listen.

349
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:24,492
Decoration.
Not for sale. Sorry.

350
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,400
I better go check on bear.

351
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,669
Mrs. Bennett.

352
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:38,736
There you are, bear.

353
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:40,104
We ordered you an enchilada.

354
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:50,513
Bear, are you all right?

355
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:51,647
Mrs. Bennett...

356
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:52,748
Jesus.

357
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,382
Mom, are you okay?

358
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,084
Would you like to sit?

359
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,919
Mom, what are you doing?

360
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:05,058
Good God, bear, don't tell me
you've been drinking again.

361
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,159
Now, remember what the doctor said.

362
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,294
Take nice, deep breaths.

363
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:09,928
I have some pills
if you're not feeling well.

364
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,896
That's a good idea.
Why don't you take them...

365
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,400
It's...

366
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:18,567
All right, folks.

367
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:21,135
She's just a little hungry.

368
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:24,271
She's hungry, and her blood sugar's dropped.

369
00:19:24,273 --> 00:19:25,705
Are you hungry, bear?

370
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,139
Mom, for God's sake!

371
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:29,840
Would you like an enchilada?

372
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:38,380
It's all right, folks.
No harm done.

373
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:40,448
They're just...
Happy to see each other.

374
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:11,144
You little son of a bitch.

375
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:13,746
I should've known.

376
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,493
Wake up, qaddafi.

377
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:06,027
We're gonna play college bowl.

378
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:08,362
For 10 points or your life...

379
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:09,663
Hey, Stevie...
Where's Charlie?

380
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,097
You got any notes from last night?

381
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:12,264
I don't need 'em.

382
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,698
Hey!

383
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,633
No, no, I've got it.
Thank you very much.

384
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:22,438
<i>Senorita,</i> your mother is going to be fine.

385
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:24,973
Take this, please.

386
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:26,874
<i>Senor,</i> I gave her a sedative.

387
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:29,042
<i>Es muy, muy</i> strong.
Let her rest?

388
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:30,476
Thank you, doctor.

389
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:33,878
We've only been back here an hour,

390
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,279
and already she's on the booze.

391
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:36,613
Would you go easy on her, dad?

392
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:39,081
She's obviously under a lot of stress.

393
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,316
Okay.

394
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:42,684
When she wakes up,

395
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,786
we won't mention a thing, okay, Laurie?

396
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:47,921
Why don't you watch her

397
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,523
while Charlie and I go
rent a boat for tomorrow?

398
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:51,857
Okay, Charlie?

399
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:53,291
Yeah. Great.

400
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:55,826
Is my hair okay?

401
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:04,499
Do you mind if I change
my shirt before we go?

402
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:07,001
No. I'll use the phone
in your room

403
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:08,302
so I won't disturb her.

404
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,873
All right. We're gonna play a game called

405
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,507
"be honest with me."

406
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:17,709
Now, the rules are very simple.

407
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:20,544
I ask you a question,

408
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:23,480
and you have to be honest with me, okay?

409
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,949
Now, where'd Charlie
pritchett go on vacation?

410
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,018
Second rule.

411
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,886
You have to answer, qaddafi.

412
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,755
Why does he keep calling me qaddafi?

413
00:22:34,757 --> 00:22:35,822
I don't know.

414
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:37,657
Now, look,

415
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:40,326
I don't want to have to
put you kids through hell.

416
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:43,094
So...

417
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:45,563
Let me tell you what's gonna happen here.

418
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,598
First, I'm gonna hurt you.

419
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,833
Then you're gonna try to be brave.

420
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,434
Then I'm gonna hurt you again.

421
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,601
Then you're gonna tell me everything.

422
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:53,935
We don't know anything.

423
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,102
We don't know.

424
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:56,369
That's not being honest.

425
00:22:56,371 --> 00:22:59,338
That's not honest.
That's not honest.

426
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:02,674
Now, look.

427
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:04,676
This is not gonna get any easier.

428
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:06,744
It's only gonna get harder.

429
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:08,645
So I don't know why you're
protecting this kid,

430
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:10,346
'cause I'm gonna find him.

431
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:13,815
Here we go. Here we go.
Attaboy.

432
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:15,750
I swear to God, we don't know where he is.

433
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:17,152
All he said was Mexico, and he's...

434
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,187
Come on! We're not trying to protect him!

435
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,855
We're not...!

436
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:24,189
I won't repeat myself.

437
00:23:29,562 --> 00:23:32,162
Mom, if you want to come down,
you're certainly welcome.

438
00:23:32,164 --> 00:23:33,997
It's just that the weather is terrible.

439
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,365
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

440
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:36,499
It's rained since we got here, mom.

441
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:38,067
There's storms everywhere.

442
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:40,302
I mean, more storms are on the way.

443
00:23:40,304 --> 00:23:42,570
Mom, I'm just thinking about you.

444
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:45,039
Mom... of course
we'd love to have

445
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,840
your company, mom.

446
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,642
Well, I know you're young enough to travel.

447
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:49,909
It has nothing to do with that.

448
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,577
<i>I know.
It has to do with her.</i>

449
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,446
Mom, please. Please, mom,
don't dredge that up.

450
00:23:57,717 --> 00:23:59,049
What's the matter?

451
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,784
You okay?

452
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:02,452
Ants! Ants everywhere!

453
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:05,755
Ants? I don't see any ants.
What you talking about?

454
00:24:05,757 --> 00:24:09,225
Mom, there are ants down here.
Ants everywhere.

455
00:24:09,227 --> 00:24:11,260
Mom, please don't dredge that up.

456
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:13,729
Because it's got nothing to do with her!

457
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:16,897
What is it?
What is it?

458
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:18,098
What is it?

459
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,400
I have a cramp in my leg.

460
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:21,534
A cramp?

461
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,270
Well, pull yourself together.
Stop screaming!

462
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:27,238
Mom? Mom, sorry. I'm...

463
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,106
No, mom, I'm not arguing with my wife.

464
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:31,508
I'm arguing with you!
I mean, mom...

465
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,376
Please, I'll have to call you back.

466
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:35,845
Mom, I'll call you back.
I'll call you right back.

467
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:37,546
Will you keep it down?

468
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:39,981
Why don't I meet you downstairs in
the lobby in, say, five minutes?

469
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:41,115
Five minutes!
All right?

470
00:24:41,117 --> 00:24:42,249
Five <i>minutos!</i>

471
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:43,683
And don't send this laundry out.

472
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:45,351
It's gonna cost me an arm and a leg.

473
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:53,157
God.

474
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:00,195
Obviously this is...

475
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:01,563
This isn't real.

476
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:06,100
It's...

477
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:07,401
It's...

478
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:08,635
It's a fake.

479
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:09,969
It's a fake.

480
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:18,977
<i>Senor! Senor!</i>

481
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:21,578
Are you okay?

482
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,646
I'm fine.

483
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,248
I ate a hot pepper.

484
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,316
Hot! Hot pepper!

485
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:31,218
No, no, no. Bad dog.

486
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:33,186
Charlie, are you okay?

487
00:25:33,188 --> 00:25:36,155
I'm fine. I just
ate a killer pepper.

488
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:38,357
A killer pepper.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

489
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,958
There's some water in the minibar, sir...

490
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
No! No, no.

491
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:44,062
I like the sensation.

492
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:45,897
Yee-hah!

493
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:47,598
Yee-hah!

494
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,067
Enchilada!

495
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:53,236
Okay. Well, you call me
if you need anything?

496
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:54,804
Will do. Thank you, paco.

497
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:57,138
Pepe!

498
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,842
God!
What's going on?

499
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:03,443
The police! This has got
to be a setup. God...

500
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:04,510
What's the matter?

501
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:06,078
There's got to be a camera or something.

502
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,647
We're in Mexico. Why would
there be a camera in Mexico?

503
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:11,182
Mexican <i>candid camera.</i>
Still on the air!

504
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:12,516
Charlie!

505
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:14,084
You're acting insane.

506
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:16,219
I'm okay.
Would you get it together?

507
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,421
Okay?
I'm okay. I'm okay.

508
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:19,889
What the hell's going on?

509
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:22,157
Look, Laurie,

510
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,592
you got to promise you won't freak, okay?

511
00:26:24,594 --> 00:26:25,859
Okay.

512
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:28,961
I found something in my duffel bag.

513
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:31,797
Something...

514
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,766
I mean... look, it's a...

515
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:36,800
What?

516
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:39,134
Forget it. It's nothing.

517
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:42,937
Charlie pritchett, this is sweet!

518
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:44,038
No!

519
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,639
You got me a present!

520
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:47,607
No! I didn't think you'd got me...

521
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:48,841
It's not a present, Laurie!

522
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:51,043
Laurie, don't open it.
It's a head!

523
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:56,947
Laurie?

524
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:58,982
Laurie!

525
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,450
Are you okay?

526
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,185
Honey.
Yeah.

527
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:14,728
<i>Senora,</i> are you all right?

528
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,630
She's fine.
Everything's fine.

529
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,898
She had a pepper, too.
She loves them, actually.

530
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,699
Are you sure, <i>senorita?</i>

531
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:43,584
You call me if you need anything?

532
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:44,818
Will do.

533
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,853
Thank you, paco.
Bye-bye.

534
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,792
Laurie, are you okay?

535
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:55,426
Can you stop screaming?

536
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:59,996
Good God, Charlie, what are you
doing with a head in your bag?

537
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:02,098
I don't know.
You think I know?

538
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,599
Yes, I think you'd know!

539
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,801
If I had a head in my bag, I think I'd know!

540
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,769
Laurie, don't get upset,

541
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,370
but there's more than one.

542
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:11,037
What?

543
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,639
Charlie, there's two?

544
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,474
No.

545
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,208
Three? Four? How many?

546
00:28:19,178 --> 00:28:20,277
Eight.

547
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:24,212
Laurie! Laurie! Wait!

548
00:28:28,684 --> 00:28:30,283
Laurie!

549
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,851
You're not in the hall.
You're in the closet.

550
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:33,586
Don't you think I realize that?

551
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:34,787
Laurie.

552
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,355
I'm not coming out.

553
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:37,823
Laurie...
I'm not!

554
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,492
You have to come out.
No.

555
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:42,693
The bodies are in there.

556
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:47,230
I was kidding.
I was kidding.

557
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,967
Kidding? You're kidding
at a time like this?

558
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:53,735
I had to calm you down.

559
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:55,937
For God's sake, try and stay calm, okay?

560
00:28:55,939 --> 00:28:58,439
Calm? You expect me
to remain calm

561
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:00,507
when you have eight human
heads in your luggage?

562
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:06,445
Laurie, there may be two people
in China who didn't hear you.

563
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,880
Well, then, what the hell's going on?

564
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:11,215
I wish I knew.

565
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:16,620
Could it be Steve or Ernie playing some
sort of sick, hideous medical prank?

566
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:18,421
I don't think so.

567
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,989
The thought of blood bothers Steve,

568
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,824
and this isn't Ernie's style.

569
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,759
They're my best friends.

570
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,962
But come on, they're dull
guys with dull lives.

571
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:28,930
You're psycho!
Jeez, Louise!

572
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:30,097
You're psycho!

573
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:32,466
We don't know anything, all right?

574
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:33,767
I don't know shit!

575
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:36,135
You're right.

576
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,871
Besides, the only heads we
have access to are cadavers.

577
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:41,206
These heads are fresh.
Charlie.

578
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,107
I'm sorry, but it's true.
Check it out for yourself.

579
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:46,276
No. Let's just
call the police.

580
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:48,044
No. No. No.

581
00:29:48,046 --> 00:29:49,178
Why?

582
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,713
Because we're in Mexico, Laurie.

583
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:53,014
A third-world country.

584
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:55,416
You don't just call the police
in a third-world country

585
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,951
and tell them you found eight
human heads in your luggage!

586
00:29:57,953 --> 00:30:00,920
Why not? Because they have no laws here.

587
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:02,288
They'll turn me into a taco.

588
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,690
All right.
What do you suggest, then?

589
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:10,027
We have to think this thing
through rationally, okay?

590
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:12,229
My God, Charlie.

591
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:13,930
What if they have your bag?

592
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:15,231
What?
Your bag.

593
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:18,167
What if the person who owns
this bag has your bag?

594
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:19,968
They're gonna come looking for you.

595
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:26,673
Laurie, I just took a
mental inventory of my bag.

596
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:29,877
There's nothing in that bag that
could possibly lead them here.

597
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:31,845
His family lives in cleary, Vermont.

598
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:33,413
They're in the furniture business.

599
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,481
Laurie's from Denver, last name Bennett.

600
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:39,083
B-e-n-n-e-t-t.

601
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:41,952
On vacation in Mexico.

602
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:43,687
Okay, that's reassuring.

603
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:46,556
What do we do?

604
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,591
Simple.

605
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:51,260
All we have to do is throw them away.

606
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:08,643
They lock the garbage.

607
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:13,647
<i>Senor</i> pritchett?

608
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,250
Paco.

609
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:19,384
Can I help you?

610
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:20,818
No, no.

611
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,588
Just putting the trash in the garbage.

612
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,556
Putting the garbage in the trash, you know?

613
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:28,890
Well, I'll take it for you.

614
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:30,391
No, no. I got it.
What is it?

615
00:31:30,393 --> 00:31:33,026
It's... it's none
of your business.

616
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:35,228
No, <i>senor.</i> I meant, what
kind of garbage is it,

617
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,863
aluminum, plastic?
We recycle here.

618
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:41,066
It's really
not recyclable. It's...

619
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:43,000
It's perishable.

620
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:45,402
Well, you...
Perishables, we compost.

621
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,970
It's really not compostable.

622
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,338
Sure, it is.

623
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,174
Everything perishable is compostable.

624
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,642
Jesus Christ!

625
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,511
I mean, come on.

626
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,313
Sorry, <i>senor.</i>

627
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,081
Go ahead and put it in.

628
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:05,319
I'll take care of it later.

629
00:32:06,455 --> 00:32:09,255
Actually, you know what?
It's fine.

630
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:11,323
I'll just take it back.

631
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:13,758
It's really not that bad, and...

632
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,628
I just need a little oil
and formaldehyde and vinegar,

633
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,297
and it'll be just as good as...

634
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,365
Are you sure, <i>senor?</i>

635
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,734
Yes. Thank you, paco.

636
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:30,572
Mom, why are you bringing
my inheritance into this?

637
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,439
<i>It's my money.</i>

638
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:33,007
Excuse me.

639
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,542
You still haven't changed?
What are you doing?

640
00:32:35,544 --> 00:32:36,910
Well, I...

641
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:38,478
No, not you, mom.

642
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,380
I found a rat in my room.

643
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:43,181
And it had a ball of yarn...

644
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:46,050
I don't want to be rude, but are you coming,

645
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:48,819
or am I gonna spend the entire day
waiting in the lobby for you?

646
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:51,688
You're so right. I'm so sorry.
I'll be right down.

647
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:55,958
<i>You've sided with her all along.</i>

648
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,231
What am I gonna do, flush them?

649
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:08,000
Nothing

650
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:08,967

651
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:10,301
around.

652
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:12,002
Here.

653
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,171
No, no, no.

654
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:16,739
<i>Por favor,</i> no clean.

655
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:19,441
No clean. No clean.
No clean.

656
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:22,677
No clean.
No clean. <i>Gracias.</i>

657
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,079
I mean, I'm asking you to come, mom,

658
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:27,581
but there's really no need for you to come.

659
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,649
It's 200 degrees here.

660
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:31,517
And you go in here.

661
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,287
Like that.

662
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:38,290
Mom, if we're cut off, it's the lightning.

663
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:39,391
<i>What?</i>

664
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:45,062
Okay.

665
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,300
Gotta go rent a boat.

666
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:51,801
I've got eight human heads in my room,

667
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:53,736
and I gotta go rent a boat.

668
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,336
Okay.

669
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,986
Mrs. pritchett?

670
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:18,421
Hi. This is
Ernie lipscomb,

671
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,122
Charlie's friend from medical school...

672
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,290
Great. In acapulco,
please, then.

673
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:25,626
The numbers for as many hotels
as you can give me.

674
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,694
I know. I know.
It is late.

675
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:30,830
It's just we've run into a little
bit of a situation up here...

676
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:32,398
All right. Okay.
The Mayan.

677
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:36,368
No, no, no. Relax.
Everything's fine,

678
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,770
but I do need to get a hold of Charlie.

679
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,705
Did he by any chance tell you

680
00:34:40,707 --> 00:34:43,074
what hotel he was staying at Mexico?

681
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,144
He didn't.

682
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,613
Right. No. I know
how sons can be.

683
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,581
All right.
That's the last one, right?

684
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:56,815
I'm good.

685
00:34:56,817 --> 00:34:58,783
School's a little crazy.

686
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,818
You know how that goes.

687
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,187
You sure he's only going away for a week?

688
00:35:03,189 --> 00:35:05,122
He packed enough stuff here for a year.

689
00:35:05,124 --> 00:35:06,990
Charlie's a compulsive packer.

690
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,193
<i>"Sleight of mind"</i> by
Charlie pritchett again.

691
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:14,162
He's writing a detective novel.

692
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:16,330
Yeah. It sounds like
his autobiography.

693
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,965
It's a pun on slight-of-hand
and dim-witted.

694
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:21,167
You know, a pun.
Play on words. Get it?

695
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:26,171
No, no, no. Relax.
Everything's fine.

696
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:31,942
I don't know.
We got midterms.

697
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:40,048
I'll talk to you soon.
Gotta go. Bye.

698
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,549
Shit.

699
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:48,954
I popped the last guy who
tried to pun me, asshole.

700
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:50,055
Get it?

701
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,723
You get it?

702
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:54,057
Yeah, I can get it, too.

703
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,758
Make some more calls.

704
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,459
You, too, asshole.

705
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:04,298
Charlie, this is none of my business,
hopefully, but let's review.

706
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,466
You've been pre-law,
pre-architect,

707
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:07,700
pre-vet, pre-med.

708
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:08,867
No. Real med.

709
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,535
And now Laurie tells me this week

710
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:12,669
you're thinking about
becoming a headshrinker.

711
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,671
Charlie.

712
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,006
What?

713
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:20,441
Shrink. Headshrinker.
Psychoanalyst.

714
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:22,943
Whatever you call an overpaid
hand-holder these days.

715
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:26,413
Actually, sir, I was thinking about that,

716
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:29,015
but I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

717
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:30,383
I'm certainly aware of that.

718
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:31,550
Dad, enough.

719
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,040
Annette?

720
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:02,945
Bear?

721
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:05,314
Wooly, are we alone?

722
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:07,115
Yeah, we're alone, but where are you?

723
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:09,216
Wooly.

724
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:11,083
What are you doing there?

725
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:13,518
Wooly, wooly, thank God.

726
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,152
Thank God you're alive.

727
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:16,653
Still alive?
Of course I'm still alive.

728
00:37:16,655 --> 00:37:17,954
Where's Laurie?

729
00:37:17,956 --> 00:37:19,822
Where's Laurie?
Not with him.

730
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:21,790
My God, not with that maniac.

731
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,892
Honey, calm down and tell me
what you're talking about.

732
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:28,062
What I'm talking about? Our
daughter is dating a mass murderer.

733
00:37:28,064 --> 00:37:31,265
I went into his room to take
a gift to put in his bag,

734
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:34,134
and in his bag, he's got body parts.

735
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:26,083
<i>Senora</i> Bennett.
I'm sorry to scare you.

736
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:27,551
I just fixing the gutter.

737
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:37,092
Dick, I am not crazy.
I know what I saw.

738
00:38:37,094 --> 00:38:38,493
Ann, I believe you.
No, you don't believe me.

739
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:40,027
Yes, I do believe you.

740
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:42,095
But you remember what the doctor
said about your drinking.

741
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:45,731
I did not hallucinate it. I had
the drink after I saw them.

742
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:47,799
What about the pills?
Please, wooly.

743
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:50,534
I saw you take them. You said
yourself they made you woozy.

744
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,102
Right.

745
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:58,406
But then what about the bag?
Okay, where's his bag?

746
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:01,242
I don't know, but I was in
his room when he unpacked.

747
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:03,811
He unpacked right in front of me.
Would a maniac do that?

748
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:17,654
No.

749
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:18,855
No.

750
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:19,989
No.

751
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,459
No, no, no.

752
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:25,460
No.

753
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:34,202
No!

754
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:37,670
It's not my room.

755
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:39,437
It's not my room!

756
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,473
It is my room.

757
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:45,774
Okay.

758
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:51,044
<i>Senor.</i>
What?

759
00:39:51,746 --> 00:39:54,012
We clean room.
What?

760
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:55,947
Room clean.
No.

761
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:07,724
Marco?

762
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:09,157
No, I'm...

763
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:12,927
Blind.

764
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:15,428
I'm blind.

765
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,396
I mean, you're blind.

766
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:19,764
I mean, I'm a guest

767
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,933
and I forgot something.

768
00:41:23,423 --> 00:41:25,222
I draw the line on mass graves.

769
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:27,791
Mass graves?

770
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:30,693
You know, maybe we should just do
individual seven of them, you know?

771
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:32,494
We don't have time.

772
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:35,330
You know what? This reminds
me of when I was a kid.

773
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:37,365
I was 13 years old,

774
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:41,869
and me and my friends used to
rip the heads off Barbie dolls

775
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:45,405
and bury them in the mud in the backyard.

776
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:47,373
Really? You used
to rip the heads...

777
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:53,678
Find any buried treasures, gringos?

778
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,779
Shit.

779
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:57,982
We have laws about these deserts.

780
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:01,151
They're environmentally
protected now, you know?

781
00:42:01,153 --> 00:42:02,619
Actually, no, we didn't know.

782
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,089
We got to protect the snakes,

783
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:09,392
protect the lizards, protect the toads.

784
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:13,028
Are you familiar with the
Mexican horny toad, <i>chiquita?</i>

785
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,295
No.

786
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:16,830
Yeah.
The Mexican horny toad

787
00:42:16,832 --> 00:42:19,499
is a very special species.

788
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:22,268
It's against the law to hurt
a horny toad in any way.

789
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:26,070
You just hurt a horny toad!

790
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:30,840
Laurie!

791
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:39,780

Yeah.

00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:44,017
No!

I want you to stay here at your hotel.

00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:00,161
You're much safer here.

798
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:01,562
Okay.

Fedex.

806

What?
Fedex 'em to Steve.

807
00:43:25,915 --> 00:43:29,716
Fedex. Laurie, we're in Mexico.
There is no fedex.

Well, then, mexex them.
I don't care.

809

810
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:37,155
And just let Steve innocently
open a package full of heads?

811
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:38,756
Of course not.
We'll call him.

but, I mean, I'm sorry.

814
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:48,097
I don't know what else to do, you know.

815
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:50,632
I think it's time that I got rid
of you two and moved along.

816
00:43:50,634 --> 00:43:52,367
Come on.
Come over here.

817
00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:54,402
What? You can't
just kill us.

818
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:55,569
We're trying, all right.

819
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:57,237
Trying? What are
you talking about?

820
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,005
What's this look like, the special Olympics?

821
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:00,606
I need the bag.
Get over here!

822
00:44:00,608 --> 00:44:01,840
Wait. I...

823
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:03,541
Trying?
You should get down.

824
00:44:03,543 --> 00:44:05,876
Listen, we can call more people.

825
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:07,310
Get down.

826
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,647
Can I answer that?
It might be Charlie.

827
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:15,849
Put it on speaker phone.

828
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:19,151
Hello?
Steve.

829
00:44:19,153 --> 00:44:21,419
Charlie, thank God.

830
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:22,987
Listen to me, you asshole.

831
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:25,222
You got my heads, and I want
'em back, you understand?

832
00:44:25,224 --> 00:44:26,323
Who is this?

833
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:27,657
<i>Never mind who this is.</i>

834
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:29,225
I want those heads.

835
00:44:29,227 --> 00:44:31,527
Jesus Christ! You're the
guy from the airplane.

836
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:33,328
Charlie, listen.
Listen. We...!

837
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,050
What does this look like, a family reunion?

838
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:40,234
Steve. What are you
doing to Steve?

839
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:42,469
I'm killing him unless you
shut up and listen to me.

840
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,103
Where are ya?

841
00:44:44,105 --> 00:44:45,571
I'm in Baja,

842
00:44:45,573 --> 00:44:46,838
<i>6 hours South of San Diego.</i>

843
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,072
Listen to me.

844
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:49,807
You meet me at the San Diego airport

845
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:51,475
and bring all eight heads with ya.

846
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:54,678
San Diego airport? I'm on vacation
with my girlfriend's parents.

847
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:59,015
Okay. Okay. San Diego.

848
00:44:59,017 --> 00:45:01,017
You make sure
you're there by 6:00.

849
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:03,719
If you ain't there, your buddies
here are history, you got it?

850
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:07,255
But what if I don't have all eight heads?

851
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:08,690
What?

852
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:12,725
I... I lost one.

853
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:15,061
You lost one?
You lost one?

854
00:45:15,063 --> 00:45:17,163
How the hell could you lose one?

855
00:45:17,165 --> 00:45:18,864
The maid got it.

856
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:20,799
What do you mean a maid?
How the hell did a maid...

857
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,668
What do you mean?
Which one did you lose?

858
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,236
I don't know.

859
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:27,404
Jeez! What a creep! This shit!

860
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:29,272
I can't believe this shit!

861
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:30,774
Damn it!

862
00:45:31,608 --> 00:45:33,608
What's happening?

863
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,010
I don't know. I don't think
he's taking it too well.

864
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:40,447
He's freakin' out.

865
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:43,283
Charlie, this guy is serious.
He's not screwin' around.

866
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:45,551
<i>He's a psycho.
You gotta do what he says.</i>

867
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:49,087
'Cause if you don't...

868
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:50,421
- Are you there?
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

869
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:52,156
Listen to this.

870
00:45:52,158 --> 00:45:54,191
<i>All right. Bring the rest
and make sure you're there.</i>

871
00:45:54,193 --> 00:45:56,059
Remember what I'm telling you. You got it?

872
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:58,461
Got it. Before you
hang up, though...

873
00:45:58,463 --> 00:45:59,762
What?

874
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:02,464
If you hurt my friends,
you'll never get them.

875
00:46:02,466 --> 00:46:04,866
What are you trying to do?
You threatening me?

876
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:08,169
No. I'm just
telling you a fact.

877
00:46:09,272 --> 00:46:11,505
And don't lose my book, either.

878
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:13,506
<i>It's my only copy.</i>

879
00:46:13,508 --> 00:46:14,640
Charlie.

880
00:46:16,644 --> 00:46:19,177
All right. All right.
Forget the book.

881
00:46:20,046 --> 00:46:21,445
I'll be there.

882
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:22,746
Yeah, you better.

883
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,184
What's happening?

884
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,721
We have to go back to San Diego.

885
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,456
San Diego?

886
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,825
My dad will shoot himself.

887
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,426
What are we gonna tell him?

888
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,695
What do you mean he forgot
to turn in his lab report?

889
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:42,762
I know it sounds flaky...

890
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:44,296
Flaky? It's ridiculous.

891
00:46:44,298 --> 00:46:45,930
You mean he came all the way to Mexico

892
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:47,298
without turning in a report,

893
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,033
and for that, we have to go home?

894
00:46:49,035 --> 00:46:50,801
Mom's sick, and anyway, it's your fault.

895
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:52,035
My fault?

896
00:46:52,037 --> 00:46:54,037
He took your advice.
He's decided on something.

897
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,973
He's decided he'll never be
a member of this family.

898
00:46:56,975 --> 00:46:57,975
That's for sure.

899
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:02,710
We're leaving.

900
00:47:02,712 --> 00:47:04,478
How did he take it?

901
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,482
Well, it's gonna have to fall into the
category of blessing in disguise.

902
00:47:08,484 --> 00:47:11,785
I'll make it up to him. I'll give
him a year of free analysis.

903
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,052
Cute. Here.

904
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:15,020
What's this?

905
00:47:15,022 --> 00:47:17,022
It's a surprise for his birthday.

906
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:18,790
He likes this macho stuff.

907
00:47:19,893 --> 00:47:21,726
Can you pack it in your bag?

908
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:23,160
I don't want him to see it.

909
00:47:23,162 --> 00:47:26,029
Where exactly would you
suggest that I put it?

910
00:47:26,031 --> 00:47:28,131
If we're going, let's get going.

911
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:29,332
Right, dad.

912
00:47:31,336 --> 00:47:33,401
The shirt's for you.
Get packing.

913
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:57,219
Laundry.

914
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:02,055
I didn't...

915
00:48:06,694 --> 00:48:07,793
Hello.

916
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,128
Thank you.

917
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:46,862
Hey, who's this guy?
He might do.

918
00:48:47,397 --> 00:48:48,562
Do for what?

919
00:48:48,564 --> 00:48:49,596
Hugo.

920
00:48:50,332 --> 00:48:51,864
Wait a minute.

921
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:53,565
Are you telling us you're
trying to find a look-alike

922
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:55,400
for the head Charlie lost?

923
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:58,836
Yeah. We got some time to kill
before we go to the airport.

924
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:00,404
My God.

925
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:02,606
But these are college professors.

926
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:05,741
You know, innocent people.

927
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,676
You can't just kill innocent people

928
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,477
because they look like someone else.

929
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,313
Let me tell you something,
college boy, nobody's innocent.

930
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:13,747
Now, who is he?

931
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,016
He was my anatomy Professor.

932
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:18,851
He almost flunked me.

933
00:49:18,853 --> 00:49:21,119
Good. Here's your chance to get even
with the prick. Get me his address.

934
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:22,420
All right.

935
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:24,889
Wait a minute. I just thought of something.

936
00:49:24,891 --> 00:49:26,023
What?

937
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:27,657
Cryonics.

938
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:28,891
Cry what?
Cryonics.

939
00:49:29,393 --> 00:49:31,159
Frozen bodies.

940
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:34,828
This university has the biggest
cryonics foundation in the country.

941
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,095
So what?

942
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:39,498
So it could save you
a lot of trouble is so what.

943
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
I mean, look, you go on
a killing spree here,

944
00:49:41,502 --> 00:49:43,768
big sep's gonna hear about it.

945
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,403
I mean, a couple of gangsters
die, nobody cares.

946
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:47,771
But you blow away professors,

947
00:49:47,773 --> 00:49:50,073
big sep's gonna read about that.

948
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:52,408
Big sep don't read.

949
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:55,411
Yeah, well, still, this cryonics facility

950
00:49:55,413 --> 00:49:57,312
has hundreds of frozen heads.

951
00:49:58,948 --> 00:50:01,048
Why they got hundreds of frozen heads?

952
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,083
I think for situations like this.

953
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:04,951
Hey, don't be a little smart ass, you.

954
00:50:04,953 --> 00:50:06,619
Look, they have 'em

955
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:09,788
because people are hoping that
in a couple of hundred years,

956
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,956
maybe they can bring 'em back to life,

957
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,223
clone 'em a healthy body.

958
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:15,225
Are you jerkin' me around?

959
00:50:15,227 --> 00:50:19,462
My God. You just put welts and
bruises over 90% of my body.

960
00:50:19,464 --> 00:50:22,698
Now you're talking about having me
help you decapitate some Professor.

961
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,933
Would I be jerking you around?

962
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:26,768
Calm down, tough guy. What
are you trying to tell me?

963
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,604
I'm trying to tell you
that right across campus

964
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:32,839
is a gold mine of heads.

965
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:36,008
Heads "r" us.
Night of a thousand heads.

966
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:38,977
If I was a guy in desperate need of a head,

967
00:50:38,979 --> 00:50:40,445
as you are,

968
00:50:40,447 --> 00:50:42,013
I'd at least check it out.

969
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,853
<i>Senor,</i> I can't find your jeep anywhere.

970
00:50:49,855 --> 00:50:52,655
What do you mean you can't find it?
It's red. <i>Rojo.</i>

971
00:50:52,657 --> 00:50:54,757
My God. I forgot.

972
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:56,658
We went for a drive last night,

973
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,559
and it got stolen.

974
00:51:00,629 --> 00:51:02,996
You forgot it was stolen?

975
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:04,797
Well, we...

976
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:07,366
This is ridiculous! How the hell
are we gonna get out of here?

977
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:09,267
It's not a problem,
<i>senor.</i> Take a plane.

978
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:11,836
A plane. A plane. Where
would we take a plane from?

979
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:14,572
Here. Since you've
been away, <i>senor,</i>

980
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:16,941
this has become a very important city.

981
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:19,410
We have built our own airport.

982
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:21,812
A plane comes every day.

983
00:51:21,814 --> 00:51:23,413
Well, aren't we lucky?

984
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,522
Now, that's a Hugo.

985
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,958
This one's good?

986
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,893
For Hugo porto, it's unbelievable.

987
00:51:39,895 --> 00:51:41,694
All right.
We got a keeper.

988
00:51:49,135 --> 00:51:50,868
What was that?

989
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,402
Thawing it out.

990
00:52:01,312 --> 00:52:02,511
No way.

991
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:06,114
Good God, look at that.

992
00:52:06,116 --> 00:52:08,082
Lassie, sit, girl. Stay.

993
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:10,751
My God.

994
00:52:13,489 --> 00:52:15,021
My God.

995
00:52:15,023 --> 00:52:16,789
Guys. Ernie.

996
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:17,990
What?

997
00:52:17,992 --> 00:52:20,025
I'm not very comfortable perhaps.

998
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:22,027
Why is that?

999
00:52:22,029 --> 00:52:24,129
We're messing with
people's immortality here.

1000
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:25,263
It's murder.

1001
00:52:26,399 --> 00:52:28,132
Technically, it's not murder, Steve,

1002
00:52:28,134 --> 00:52:29,600
because they're already dead.

1003
00:52:29,602 --> 00:52:33,503
No. These people believed
in this freezing thing.

1004
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,371
This is like grave robbing.

1005
00:52:36,474 --> 00:52:38,607
Grave robbing or worse.

1006
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:40,742
I don't see any graves.

1007
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,010
Do you see any graves?

1008
00:52:43,012 --> 00:52:44,945
There's gonna be two fresh ones right now

1009
00:52:44,947 --> 00:52:47,113
if you two don't start
looking for heads. Come on.

1010
00:52:55,556 --> 00:52:56,922
All right.

1011
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,456
Sir, I'm really sorry about the jeep.

1012
00:52:58,458 --> 00:52:59,857
It's open seating.

1013
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:03,060
Take these tickets and you
check in the big stuff.

1014
00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:05,896
We'll take the little stuff,
and we'll go get the seats.

1015
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:07,597
Do you think you can handle that?

1016
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,131
Yes. I really appreciate...

1017
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:10,465
Come on, bear. Come here.

1018
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:18,003
Do you have anything to declare?

1019
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:20,205
Any fruits? Vegetables?
Native plants?

1020
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:21,739
Are you kidding?

1021
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:30,446
Anything to declare?
Fruits? Vegetables?

1022
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:35,283
Sobrino! Sobrino!

1023
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:37,385
I'll get it.

1024
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:44,257
Excuse me. Could you
hand me my bag, please?

1025
00:53:45,627 --> 00:53:47,193
I don't have <i>un momento.</i>

1026
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:49,895
I have un plane-o
to catch-o. Got it?

1027
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,999
Excuse me. It's right there. I can see it.

1028
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:58,134
I'll just reach in and get it myself, okay?

1029
00:53:58,136 --> 00:53:59,902
<i>Senor,</i> no. No, <i>senor.</i>

1030
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:02,471
Halt!

1031
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,111
What? Is it dad?

1032
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:13,713
Is it dad?

1033
00:54:14,882 --> 00:54:15,914
What?

1034
00:54:17,717 --> 00:54:20,016
They found two heads
in dad's carry-on.

1035
00:54:21,052 --> 00:54:22,618
No.

1036
00:54:25,856 --> 00:54:27,388
Put me down.
Put me down.

1037
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,522
My God.

1038
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,724
Help me. Help me.

1039
00:54:36,096 --> 00:54:37,195
My God.

1040
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:46,403
Decent. Hold this one.

1041
00:54:46,405 --> 00:54:47,704
Yeah? Wait.

1042
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,540
Do you need a Helen?

1043
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:52,842
No. You can play with her when I leave.
Get over there.

1044
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:58,213
This guy do anything for you?

1045
00:55:01,284 --> 00:55:03,350
He's not bad either.
COD be a st...

1046
00:55:04,586 --> 00:55:07,420
Yeah? We could beat
him up a little bit,

1047
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:08,654
give him a few cuts.

1048
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:10,522
Random disfigurement.

1049
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:14,092
Yeah, definitely a st...

1050
00:55:14,094 --> 00:55:16,360
It's worth a try anyway. I'll
take him, and I'll take him.

1051
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:17,527
Great.
I'll wrap them up.

1052
00:55:17,529 --> 00:55:21,129
What do you mean, "take,".

1053
00:55:21,764 --> 00:55:23,063
You know,

1054
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:26,065
for a future doctor,

1055
00:55:26,067 --> 00:55:28,233
you're a pretty stupid kid.

1056
00:55:28,235 --> 00:55:30,501
I mean take the heads.

1057
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,708
No. No. No. No way.

1058
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,578
You do it. This was
your crazy idea, okay?

1059
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,147
It's my idea that you should do it.

1060
00:55:45,149 --> 00:55:46,481
But he's the neurologist.

1061
00:55:46,483 --> 00:55:48,416
I'm only going into dermatology.

1062
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:51,351
So don't screw up the skin.

1063
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08,065
Now there's a pleasant sound.

1064
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,206
Mr. escobedo,
this is my mother Annette,

1065
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:19,075
Charlie, and fern Bennett, dad's mom.

1066
00:56:19,077 --> 00:56:21,610
She flew down to help us out with bail.

1067
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:23,912
Nana, this is dad's Mexican lawyer.

1068
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,313
Delighted.

1069
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,415
Charmed.
Now cut the crap

1070
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,083
and tell us what the hell's going on.

1071
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,217
Certainly.

1072
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:36,188
<i>Amigos,</i> in your country,
you have what you call

1073
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,224
the good news and the bad news.

1074
00:56:39,226 --> 00:56:43,293
The good news is that Mr. Bennett
underwent only very mild torture.

1075
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:46,296
Jesus.
My God.

1076
00:56:46,298 --> 00:56:48,898
Shut up, you poodle.
What's the bad news?

1077
00:56:50,234 --> 00:56:52,167
He confessed and was sentenced to death.

1078
00:56:53,336 --> 00:56:54,635
My God!

1079
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:56,235
That little weakling.

1080
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:00,005
Mom!

1081
00:57:00,007 --> 00:57:01,906
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Don't get upset yet.

1082
00:57:01,908 --> 00:57:03,908
Not get upset?

1083
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,609
Let the man speak, damn it.

1084
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:07,010
There are remedies here.

1085
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:08,444
This is a civilized country.

1086
00:57:08,446 --> 00:57:09,912
Surely there's going to be a trial,

1087
00:57:09,914 --> 00:57:11,179
some sort of hearing.

1088
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:13,047
Of course.
When my partner arrives,

1089
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:14,915
we will formulate our strategy.

1090
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:16,750
Until then, try to relax.

1091
00:57:16,752 --> 00:57:18,384
It's a beautiful day.

1092
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:19,885
Enjoy Mexico.

1093
00:57:19,887 --> 00:57:21,753
I can't believe it.

1094
00:57:21,755 --> 00:57:23,988
Things get a little rough, he cracks.

1095
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,823
Nana, they tortured him.

1096
00:57:25,825 --> 00:57:28,125
What? A little castor oil
down his gullet?

1097
00:57:29,328 --> 00:57:31,494
A little electricity on his dillywacker?

1098
00:57:33,064 --> 00:57:34,296
Cat piss.

1099
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:47,640
I am spent.

1100
00:57:50,444 --> 00:57:52,977
Chopping off heads just takes it out of you?

1101
00:57:56,749 --> 00:57:58,715
Shit!

1102
00:57:58,717 --> 00:58:01,517
Time to go. I got four heads. I'm screwed.

1103
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:04,019
But you got a good start.

1104
00:58:04,021 --> 00:58:07,322
I'm sure one of those heads in there
will do for the one Charlie lost.

1105
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:09,390
I doubt it, the way my
luck's running today, kid.

1106
00:58:10,593 --> 00:58:12,192
Well, let's take a second

1107
00:58:12,194 --> 00:58:14,994
and take stock of where we are so far.

1108
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:17,196
Let me tell you something, kid, okay?

1109
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:18,764
Just so you know.

1110
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:20,198
I gotta kill the both of you,

1111
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,099
so don't think by helping me,

1112
00:58:22,101 --> 00:58:23,667
it's gonna change that, all right?

1113
00:58:23,669 --> 00:58:25,001
Yeah, I know. I sure.

1114
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:27,436
I'm just saying that you're doing all right.

1115
00:58:27,438 --> 00:58:28,937
You might be better off than you think.

1116
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,838
Okay, but I'm just saying, too,

1117
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,372
I want you to know.

1118
00:58:33,007 --> 00:58:34,706
Okay, let's see.

1119
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:37,575
I got a Hugo, a Marty,

1120
00:58:37,577 --> 00:58:40,210
a so-so stu,
and a bad Frank.

1121
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:41,544
Right. And then
at the morgue,

1122
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:43,312
you said something about little Joey.

1123
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:46,181
Right. All right,
so I got little Joey,

1124
00:58:46,183 --> 00:58:48,850
a Hugo, a Marty, and a bad Frank.

1125
00:58:48,852 --> 00:58:50,017
Now, where's stu?

1126
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:52,019
I said stu. So-so st...

1127
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:53,987
No. Just a second ago,
you said little Joey.

1128
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,555
I know I said little Joey,

1129
00:58:55,557 --> 00:58:56,923
but I also said st...

1130
00:58:56,925 --> 00:58:58,457
Right. But then
where's Frank?

1131
00:58:59,593 --> 00:59:01,059
All right.
Look, start over.

1132
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:02,760
You got a Hugo...
Yeah.

1133
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:04,595
A little Joey...
Yeah.

1134
00:59:04,597 --> 00:59:06,096
A Frank...
Yeah.

1135
00:59:06,098 --> 00:59:10,032
A bad stu...
No. Frank. Bad Frank.

1136
00:59:10,034 --> 00:59:11,666
That's what I said.

1137
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:13,834
No, you didn't. You said bad stu.
Stu was just so-so.

1138
00:59:13,836 --> 00:59:16,169
No, sir.
I said a so-so st...

1139
00:59:16,171 --> 00:59:17,503
You did not.
You said bad st...

1140
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:19,204
Yes, I did.
Everyone heard.

1141
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:20,806
I said a so-so st...

1142
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,274
You said bad st...

1143
00:59:22,276 --> 00:59:23,942
I know the names, and you don't!

1144
00:59:23,944 --> 00:59:27,011
You two stop it, damn it!

1145
00:59:28,981 --> 00:59:32,282
These are not baseball cards
we're talking about here,

1146
00:59:32,284 --> 00:59:33,483
all right?

1147
00:59:33,485 --> 00:59:36,519
These are heads, human beings' heads.

1148
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:42,423
Where were we?

1149
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:43,557
I said... okay.

1150
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:46,126
I got a Hugo, a...
Yes.

1151
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:48,461
Ho, ho, ho. Wait a minute. Just a second.

1152
00:59:51,998 --> 00:59:54,031
I can't believe I didn't notice this before.

1153
00:59:54,033 --> 00:59:55,198
What?

1154
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,266
With some black hair and a busted nose,

1155
00:59:57,268 --> 00:59:58,967
this kid makes a decent Frank.

1156
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:00,168
What?
Yeah.

1157
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:04,004
I mean, I know you're a little young,

1158
01:00:04,006 --> 01:00:06,106
but with that stubble,
a couple of missing teeth...

1159
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:07,640
But you have a Frank.

1160
01:00:07,642 --> 01:00:09,408
I got a bad Frank.
You make a better one.

1161
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,177
But you don't even know if you need a Frank.

1162
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:13,211
I might.

1163
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:14,745
Please, please, no.

1164
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:17,114
Listen, please, no. Listen,
I don't want any trouble.

1165
01:00:17,116 --> 01:00:18,949
I fly. I fly.

1166
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:20,350
What are you, a fairy?

1167
01:00:20,352 --> 01:00:23,319
No, no, no, no.
He has a pilot's license.

1168
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:24,920
You don't want to fly a commercial airline

1169
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,655
to San Diego with all these heads.

1170
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:28,490
That's how you got in this
mess in the first place.

1171
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:30,191
He can fly us.
It's smarter.

1172
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,193
Fly.

1173
01:00:32,094 --> 01:00:33,193
All right, grab all those heads.

1174
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:34,727
Just leave the top one.

1175
01:00:34,729 --> 01:00:36,228
Why?

1176
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,697
Because the top one
doesn't look like anybody,

1177
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:40,432
and big sep will never buy it. Let's go.

1178
01:00:40,434 --> 01:00:43,401
Wait a minute. Wait.
Just a minute.

1179
01:00:43,403 --> 01:00:46,837
I sawed this off, and you're
not even gonna use it.

1180
01:00:46,839 --> 01:00:47,938
Steve, chill.

1181
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,139
No, you chill.

1182
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:51,574
It's not fair, all right?

1183
01:00:51,576 --> 01:00:53,809
I spent a lot of time on this head.

1184
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:56,878
Don't you think that you could
have at least told me this

1185
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,446
before I cut it off?

1186
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:00,514
I saw that coming.

1187
01:01:00,516 --> 01:01:02,949
Don't ever fuck with a
guy looking for heads.

1188
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,650
Good advice.

1189
01:01:04,652 --> 01:01:06,852
Now take all the heads, and let's go.

1190
01:01:06,854 --> 01:01:07,854
Okay?
Okay.

1191
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:10,521
<i>Big sep, it's Benny.</i>

1192
01:01:11,557 --> 01:01:13,323
Where the hell are my heads?

1193
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:14,991
I just talked to Tommy a while ago.

1194
01:01:14,993 --> 01:01:16,192
He'll be there tomorrow.

1195
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:18,294
First it was two weeks ago,

1196
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:20,329
then three days ago.

1197
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:22,664
I gave them to Tommy.
It's Tommy's deal now.

1198
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:24,899
Don't you talk to me about Tommy.
I trust Tommy.

1199
01:01:25,801 --> 01:01:27,534
This is your job.

1200
01:01:27,536 --> 01:01:29,202
<i>Big sep, what are we talking about here?</i>

1201
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:30,736
Heads.

1202
01:01:30,738 --> 01:01:32,904
It's not like they got any
value on the open market.

1203
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:34,405
It's not like we're talking
God damn diamonds here.

1204
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:36,507
You know, that's what's bothering me, Ben.

1205
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:40,077
A guy pays 80 grand and doesn't see proof,

1206
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,612
he starts thinking maybe,

1207
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:45,781
just maybe, he's been
double-crossed.

1208
01:01:45,783 --> 01:01:46,982
You know what I mean?

1209
01:01:46,984 --> 01:01:48,550
Big sep,

1210
01:01:48,552 --> 01:01:51,853
I swear on the soul of my dead mother,

1211
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:53,821
I offed them myself.

1212
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:56,557
Me and Rico.
I give you my word.

1213
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,127
Your word ain't what I paid you
80 fuckin' grand for, Ben.

1214
01:02:00,129 --> 01:02:04,297
I paid you 80 fuckin' grand
to see their fuckin' heads.

1215
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,133
Now, you bring me their heads.

1216
01:02:10,737 --> 01:02:12,336
Benny!

1217
01:02:12,338 --> 01:02:14,171
Benny! Benny! Come in here! Hurry up!

1218
01:02:16,008 --> 01:02:18,241
Benny, you're not gonna believe this.
Look at this.

1219
01:02:19,677 --> 01:02:20,909
My God, that's...

1220
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:22,477
That's Hugo and st...

1221
01:02:22,479 --> 01:02:24,779
Didn't I tell you they'd show up, Benny?
Didn't I tell you?

1222
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:26,380
This is not good.

1223
01:02:26,382 --> 01:02:27,981
Not good? What the hell's
big sep gonna say, Benny?

1224
01:02:27,983 --> 01:02:29,115
Shut up!

1225
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:38,090
<i>Ernie lipscomb, please pick
up the courtesy phone.</i>

1226
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:40,826
<i>Ernie lipscomb, please pick
up the courtesy phone.</i>

1227
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:44,562
Yes, Janice.
Make sure you check...

1228
01:02:44,564 --> 01:02:46,130
This is Ernie lipscomb.

1229
01:02:46,132 --> 01:02:48,832
Ernie, it's Charlie.
Let me talk to him.

1230
01:02:50,302 --> 01:02:51,934
Sure. It's for you.

1231
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,672
Yeah?
Hi. It's Charlie. I...

1232
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,242
What? How could you
lose two more heads?

1233
01:03:02,244 --> 01:03:04,043
<i>Well, the police got them.</i>

1234
01:03:04,045 --> 01:03:05,677
How could the police get them?

1235
01:03:07,647 --> 01:03:10,213
<i>The one I lost earlier, I got it back...</i>

1236
01:03:14,117 --> 01:03:15,615
What are you looking at?

1237
01:03:17,986 --> 01:03:21,654
He's talking about potheads.

1238
01:03:21,656 --> 01:03:24,556
We're deprogrammers
with marijuana anonymous.

1239
01:03:25,592 --> 01:03:27,558
He hates to lose a client.

1240
01:03:29,094 --> 01:03:31,961
Listen to me, you little
incompetent piece of shit, you.

1241
01:03:31,963 --> 01:03:33,395
Where are you exactly?

1242
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:35,196
The LA purisima hotel.

1243
01:03:35,198 --> 01:03:37,598
Don't move. Don't leave
your room for anything.

1244
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,333
I'm coming down there.

1245
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:41,902
If there's any more heads missing
by the time I get there,

1246
01:03:41,904 --> 01:03:43,803
I'm gonna replace them with
your family and your friends.

1247
01:03:43,805 --> 01:03:44,870
<i>You hear me?</i>

1248
01:03:49,142 --> 01:03:51,008
He really cares,

1249
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,575
and that's what makes him the best.

1250
01:03:55,112 --> 01:03:56,112
What?

1251
01:03:59,215 --> 01:04:01,114
I'm thinking that once he gets
these heads away from us,

1252
01:04:01,116 --> 01:04:03,015
your dad's a goner.

1253
01:04:03,017 --> 01:04:04,783
We gotta move.

1254
01:04:04,785 --> 01:04:06,751
I saw a place just outside of here.

1255
01:04:06,753 --> 01:04:09,987
You gotta check into the hotel.
Come on. Get up.

1256
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:12,055
I'll take these...

1257
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,890
I had nowhere else to put them.

1258
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,558
I'll take these to the American border.

1259
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,959
I'll give them to the police.

1260
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:18,694
I'll rent a car.
I'll drive all night.

1261
01:04:18,696 --> 01:04:19,728
What am I gonna tell my mother?

1262
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,730
Tell her anything.
Tell her we had a fight.

1263
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:24,833
Tell her I called you fat. It
doesn't matter what she thinks.

1264
01:04:24,835 --> 01:04:26,701
The important thing is to save your dad.

1265
01:04:27,136 --> 01:04:28,136
Fat?

1266
01:04:29,037 --> 01:04:30,770
Look, Laurie,

1267
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:32,371
maybe your dad was right about me.

1268
01:04:32,373 --> 01:04:34,973
Maybe I'm a total nimrod who can't
follow through on anything.

1269
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:36,808
But I got him into this.

1270
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:38,976
I promise you

1271
01:04:39,678 --> 01:04:41,243
I'm gonna get him out.

1272
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,948
Get your hands off her, you maniac.

1273
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,349
You may want me to think I'm crazy,

1274
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:51,818
but I'm not crazy, and I'm not stupid.

1275
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,653
You had those heads hid in your room,

1276
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:55,588
and then you pinned them on my dick!

1277
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,456
Mom, what are you saying?
What am I saying?

1278
01:04:57,458 --> 01:05:00,725
I'm saying I'm calling the police on him.
I'm gonna do it right now.

1279
01:05:03,896 --> 01:05:05,379
No!
No!

1280
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,863
Mom, calling the police
is a bad idea. No. No.

1281
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:09,465
Laurie, I love you. Take
your hand off the phone.

1282
01:05:09,467 --> 01:05:11,800
You back off. I know
exactly what I am doing.

1283
01:05:11,802 --> 01:05:13,368
You're not thinking clearly.

1284
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,703
I'm thinking perfectly! I
know exactly what I'm doing.

1285
01:05:15,705 --> 01:05:17,404
I told you to back off!

1286
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:19,305
Operator? Yes. No,
I wasn't yelling at you.

1287
01:05:19,307 --> 01:05:21,206
Could you get me the police, please?

1288
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:25,176
Yes. Operator, I need you
to get the police for me.

1289
01:05:25,178 --> 01:05:26,544
Can you... <i>Policia?</i>

1290
01:05:29,548 --> 01:05:31,214
I'm trying to reach the police.

1291
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:32,548
The <i>policia?</i>

1292
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:35,017
<i>Gracias.</i> Yes. <i>Si.</i>

1293
01:05:36,286 --> 01:05:37,485
<i>Will you hold, please?</i>

1294
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:39,887
Yes. Of course I'll hold.
I'm happy to hold.

1295
01:05:39,889 --> 01:05:42,121
For Christ's sake, keep it down.

1296
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:46,624
Yes. Hello, police.
Yes, I have...

1297
01:05:53,265 --> 01:05:55,131
Go. Charlie, hurry.

1298
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:56,232
Go.

1299
01:05:56,234 --> 01:05:57,234
Just go.

1300
01:06:00,537 --> 01:06:01,935
I need to rent a car.

1301
01:06:04,205 --> 01:06:06,071
Sure. That's no problem.

1302
01:06:07,007 --> 01:06:08,573
We got chevys,

1303
01:06:09,242 --> 01:06:10,441
jeeps,

1304
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:12,309
chevys.

1305
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:14,110
Hey.

1306
01:06:14,112 --> 01:06:15,544
That looks like our jeep.

1307
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,414
Well...

1308
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:21,349
There's a lot of jeeps, you know, <i>senor?</i>

1309
01:06:21,351 --> 01:06:23,584
With this magazine in them?
I don't think so.

1310
01:06:23,586 --> 01:06:25,619
This jeep was stolen from us.

1311
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:28,221
I don't know, <i>senor.</i> A lot
of people read magazines.

1312
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,689
On grand mal seizures?
You gotta be kidding me!

1313
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:34,259
You really like that magazine?

1314
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:35,660
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

1315
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:37,795
You rent this jeep,

1316
01:06:37,797 --> 01:06:40,097
I'm gonna throw in that magazine for <i>nada.</i>

1317
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:47,903
Unbelievable.

1318
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,891
Excuse me.
Where can we rent a car?

1319
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,692
All right, make sure it has ac.

1320
01:07:12,694 --> 01:07:13,826
Hold on, champ.

1321
01:07:17,063 --> 01:07:19,329
Are you just telling me I just passed out?

1322
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:20,697
No, no. Drink up. You're
a little dehydrated.

1323
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:21,898
You're such a mother.

1324
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:24,867
All right, I'm gonna get us packed.

1325
01:07:24,869 --> 01:07:26,802
My butt's staying right here.

1326
01:07:26,804 --> 01:07:28,904
Why? I hear the tropicana's wonderful.

1327
01:07:28,906 --> 01:07:31,139
It's a waste of money, honey.

1328
01:07:31,141 --> 01:07:34,275
Give me the 2 cs. A cot
and a crapper, I'm set.

1329
01:07:34,277 --> 01:07:35,976
But...

1330
01:07:35,978 --> 01:07:37,544
Laurie, Charlie, it's Ernie.

1331
01:07:37,546 --> 01:07:38,678
Jesus.

1332
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,713
Who's Ernie?
Nobody, grandma.

1333
01:07:40,715 --> 01:07:42,581
Well, he sure as hell seems to know you.

1334
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:45,150
No, grandma. Is this some
guy boffing on the side?

1335
01:07:45,152 --> 01:07:46,317
Grandma!

1336
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,652
What the hell are you doing, honey?

1337
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:50,687
Where's Charlie?

1338
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:51,921
Who are you?

1339
01:07:51,923 --> 01:07:53,055
I asked you a question.

1340
01:07:53,057 --> 01:07:54,990
Where the fuck is Charlie?

1341
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,224
And I asked you a question.

1342
01:07:56,226 --> 01:07:58,025
Who the fuck are you?

1343
01:08:00,863 --> 01:08:04,130
Well, now that we're in this friggin'
LA purisima, what do we do now?

1344
01:08:04,132 --> 01:08:07,599
We find the cop station,
and we get our heads.

1345
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:09,467
All right.

1346
01:08:09,469 --> 01:08:11,836
Benny, look, look. It's him.
It's him. It's Tommy.

1347
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,704
Come on.
All of you, get in there.

1348
01:08:13,706 --> 01:08:15,172
What do you think he's doing?

1349
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,073
Think he got the heads back already or what?

1350
01:08:17,075 --> 01:08:20,076
I don't know, but why don't
we follow him? Come on.

1351
01:08:37,928 --> 01:08:39,794
Where the hell's he going?

1352
01:08:40,563 --> 01:08:41,695
Keep following him.

1353
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:45,031
I told Charlie to stay put.

1354
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:47,433
I told that little son
of a bitch to stay put.

1355
01:08:47,435 --> 01:08:50,969
So, who are you? God? Why the
hell should he listen to you?

1356
01:08:50,971 --> 01:08:53,204
I am so groggy.

1357
01:08:53,206 --> 01:08:55,940
Do you mind if I lie down in the back?

1358
01:08:55,942 --> 01:08:58,375
I don't give a shit what you do, lady.
Just keep quiet.

1359
01:08:58,377 --> 01:09:00,110
Watch your language.

1360
01:09:00,879 --> 01:09:03,479
Fern, stop it!

1361
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:16,357
My God!

1362
01:09:19,294 --> 01:09:20,760
Another head!

1363
01:09:20,762 --> 01:09:22,461
My God!

1364
01:09:22,463 --> 01:09:26,231
Help! Help!
Lady, lady, shut up!

1365
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:27,665
I can't stand it!

1366
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,199
I'm losing my mind!

1367
01:09:29,201 --> 01:09:31,301
Everywhere I look, there are heads!

1368
01:09:32,737 --> 01:09:33,936
Shut up, lady!

1369
01:09:33,938 --> 01:09:35,671
Jesus Christ!

1370
01:09:35,673 --> 01:09:38,940
You're not the only person on the
planet with problems, okay? Shut it!

1371
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:41,575
Jesus! What a head case!

1372
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,843
Is that supposed to be a joke?

1373
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:45,177
Killer humor?

1374
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,046
Looked like this guy I dated in high school,

1375
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:51,515
this Hugo, Hugo porto.

1376
01:09:57,755 --> 01:09:59,321
Hey, I think we better pull over,

1377
01:09:59,323 --> 01:10:01,423
'cause we need some gas soon.

1378
01:10:01,425 --> 01:10:03,158
Keep fuckin' driving.
Okay.

1379
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,626
Didn't I tell you to watch
your fuckin' language?

1380
01:10:07,229 --> 01:10:09,262
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1381
01:10:10,265 --> 01:10:12,298
Get your hands off me, you goon.

1382
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,999
Don't fuck with me...

1383
01:10:14,401 --> 01:10:15,767
Grandma!

1384
01:10:23,775 --> 01:10:25,608
My money says he ain't got the heads.

1385
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:27,009
Mine, too.

1386
01:10:27,011 --> 01:10:29,344
Man.
How could you do that?

1387
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:31,412
How could I what?
Throw her off the cliff.

1388
01:10:32,748 --> 01:10:34,280
A man can only take so much, kid.

1389
01:10:36,384 --> 01:10:37,716
My God.

1390
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:41,352
I can't believe this.

1391
01:10:41,354 --> 01:10:43,053
I can't believe it.

1392
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:47,090
I thought the old battle-ax
would never die.

1393
01:10:47,092 --> 01:10:48,092
Mom.

1394
01:10:59,203 --> 01:11:00,302
He...

1395
01:11:08,678 --> 01:11:10,911
So what do you wanna do now?

1396
01:11:10,913 --> 01:11:13,113
Keep following them. But I
don't like the smell of this.

1397
01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:26,124
Well, well, well,

1398
01:11:26,126 --> 01:11:27,959
if it isn't our old <i>amigo.</i>

1399
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:29,426
No, not again.

1400
01:11:31,463 --> 01:11:33,329
Isn't once enough?

1401
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,230
Can't you give a guy a break?

1402
01:11:35,232 --> 01:11:37,198
One human being
to another. Come on.

1403
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,667
That's very moving, gringo,

1404
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:41,535
but the real question is,

1405
01:11:41,537 --> 01:11:44,371
are we going to cut off your
<i>cohonies</i> or leave them on?

1406
01:11:44,373 --> 01:11:45,672
You don't have to do this.

1407
01:11:45,674 --> 01:11:47,206
Come on, guys.
Come on.

1408
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:49,474
Can't we flip for it?

1409
01:11:51,277 --> 01:11:53,677
What? A coin, you know? Flip a coin.

1410
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,045
I win, you let me go.

1411
01:11:55,047 --> 01:11:57,280
You win, you mangle me.

1412
01:12:04,488 --> 01:12:06,187
You're a crazy man, gringo.

1413
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,195
Call it.
Heads.

1414
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,030
You sure?

1415
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:18,564
You don't even want to think about it?

1416
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:21,533
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

1417
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:52,558
Juan!

1418
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:54,826
Don't take the keys!

1419
01:12:55,361 --> 01:12:57,159
God!

1420
01:13:03,966 --> 01:13:06,399
This has not been a very good vacation.

1421
01:13:13,907 --> 01:13:14,907
Hello?

1422
01:13:18,111 --> 01:13:19,176
Hello?

1423
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:22,145
Who's there?

1424
01:13:24,048 --> 01:13:25,514
Hey! Hey!

1425
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:27,716
Stop!

1426
01:13:29,386 --> 01:13:31,586
<i>¶ Bum-bum-bum-bum
bum-bum-bum-bum</i>

1427
01:13:31,588 --> 01:13:33,154
<i>¶ bum-bum-bum-bum-bum</i>

1428
01:13:33,156 --> 01:13:34,889
<i>¶ Mr. sandman... ¶</i>

1429
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:38,579
Not your kind of music? I hate that shit.

1430
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:42,428
Are you talking to me?

1431
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:47,965
I said,
"are you talking to me?"

1432
01:13:51,269 --> 01:13:54,636
I said, "are you
talking to me?"

1433
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,540
I don't know who you're talking to.

1434
01:13:59,542 --> 01:14:01,909
I'm the only one here.

1435
01:14:01,911 --> 01:14:04,111
Shut the fuck up!

1436
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:05,412
Are you talking to me?

1437
01:14:05,414 --> 01:14:06,980
Yeah, I'm talking to you!

1438
01:14:06,982 --> 01:14:08,147
Shut up!

1439
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:09,781
Shut it!

1440
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:12,383
Screwball.

1441
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:17,086
What's that?

1442
01:14:17,088 --> 01:14:18,287
What's what?

1443
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:19,921
Stop. Stop.

1444
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:21,088
No.

1445
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,825
Hold on, now.
Hold on. Hold on.

1446
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:27,193
Just... okay,
okay, okay. Okay.

1447
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:28,627
Stop!

1448
01:14:29,196 --> 01:14:30,962
Okay. Don't shoot.

1449
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:41,137
I thought I told you to stay put.

1450
01:14:41,139 --> 01:14:43,439
Where's my heads?
Where's my heads?

1451
01:14:43,441 --> 01:14:45,307
They're in the jeep.
They're in the coolers.

1452
01:14:45,309 --> 01:14:46,541
Good. Come on.

1453
01:14:46,543 --> 01:14:48,075
But I lost another one.

1454
01:14:48,077 --> 01:14:49,077
What?

1455
01:14:49,812 --> 01:14:51,411
Here, coyote.

1456
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,180
What's he doing?

1457
01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:57,148
Well, the kid ain't dead.
That's for sure.

1458
01:14:58,484 --> 01:14:59,583
Here, coyote.

1459
01:15:05,823 --> 01:15:07,789
Come. Shit!

1460
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:10,258
What? What is it?

1461
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,360
Shit. I'm dead.

1462
01:15:12,362 --> 01:15:14,929
Well, whoever they are, it doesn't
look like they're coming after us.

1463
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:16,630
Not yet.

1464
01:15:16,632 --> 01:15:19,265
Just the fact that they're
here means I'm dead, though.

1465
01:15:19,267 --> 01:15:21,533
When? As soon as I
give you the heads?

1466
01:15:21,535 --> 01:15:24,636
Or as soon as I get them
across to the states.

1467
01:15:24,638 --> 01:15:27,271
Knowing them, they're gonna
let me take that risk, too.

1468
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,006
Who are the heads, anyway?

1469
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:31,240
What?

1470
01:15:31,242 --> 01:15:34,109
None of your business.
What the hell do you care?

1471
01:15:34,111 --> 01:15:35,743
You spend your vacation
with a bunch of heads,

1472
01:15:35,745 --> 01:15:38,278
you kind of want to know, you know?

1473
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,913
You think about their
hopes and their dreams,

1474
01:15:41,582 --> 01:15:43,348
their lives cut short.

1475
01:15:44,351 --> 01:15:46,217
Hopes, dreams.

1476
01:15:46,219 --> 01:15:47,585
Those bums.

1477
01:15:47,587 --> 01:15:49,053
You have to feel something.

1478
01:15:49,055 --> 01:15:50,287
You don't just kill eight people

1479
01:15:50,289 --> 01:15:51,688
and not feel anything.

1480
01:15:53,391 --> 01:15:55,224
Look, it don't really matter,

1481
01:15:55,226 --> 01:15:57,793
but let's just set
the record straight, okay?

1482
01:15:57,795 --> 01:16:00,428
First of all, I didn't whack 'em.
Those guys did.

1483
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,730
Second,
Mr. phi beta craphead,

1484
01:16:02,732 --> 01:16:05,832
if I hadn't fucked up,
I'd be retiring after this.

1485
01:16:08,336 --> 01:16:09,802
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, look.

1486
01:16:13,673 --> 01:16:15,139
What the hell's he doing?

1487
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:17,021
It looks like he's chasing
aunt philomena's dog.

1488
01:16:19,377 --> 01:16:21,243
Hey, what if we can help
each other out here?

1489
01:16:21,245 --> 01:16:22,944
Impossible.
Why?

1490
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:24,779
Because you're too stupid,

1491
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:26,213
and, besides, I'm not gonna take the chance

1492
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:28,014
of going across that border.

1493
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:29,482
Well, if you know it all,

1494
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,317
then how come you're in
this mess to begin with?

1495
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:32,718
Because of bad luck.

1496
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,987
It's not my fault that the bag
was too big to go in carry-on.

1497
01:16:35,989 --> 01:16:38,923
There was a gift shop
right next to the gate.

1498
01:16:38,925 --> 01:16:40,691
Didn't you ever think of taking two bags?

1499
01:16:41,827 --> 01:16:43,126
Shit.

1500
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:49,897
So I'll repeat the question.

1501
01:16:49,899 --> 01:16:53,332
What if there were a way we
could help each other out here?

1502
01:16:53,334 --> 01:16:54,499
What way?

1503
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:10,247
I'm not into mass murder if
I'm not getting paid for it,

1504
01:17:10,249 --> 01:17:14,217
but I'm warning you, anybody
gets in my way is dead.

1505
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:16,118
Thank you again for getting rid of fern.

1506
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,586
Mom!

1507
01:17:17,588 --> 01:17:20,689
The going rate is five thou,
but you could owe me, lady.

1508
01:17:31,467 --> 01:17:33,166
Where the hell's he going?

1509
01:17:33,168 --> 01:17:35,608
I don't know. Do I look like a mind reader?
Come on! Let's go!

1510
01:17:36,871 --> 01:17:39,037
So now what do we do?
Drive for the border?

1511
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:41,738
Hell, no. We gotta get those
heads back and save your dad.

1512
01:17:42,607 --> 01:17:44,039
Hey!

1513
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:45,740
Come back here!

1514
01:17:45,742 --> 01:17:47,441
I'll kick your ass!

1515
01:18:14,936 --> 01:18:16,201
Come on, Benny.
Let's take him now.

1516
01:18:16,203 --> 01:18:19,003
I expect that's exactly what he wants.

1517
01:18:20,673 --> 01:18:23,273
Let's see how lucky we got here.

1518
01:18:24,876 --> 01:18:26,642
Well, we got Marty.

1519
01:18:31,214 --> 01:18:32,980
We got Benito.

1520
01:18:38,686 --> 01:18:40,018
Little Joey.

1521
01:18:42,022 --> 01:18:43,421
What is he doing?

1522
01:18:43,423 --> 01:18:44,522
I don't know. It's like he's teasing us.

1523
01:18:44,524 --> 01:18:46,457
Wait a minute.
It's caught on my neck.

1524
01:18:48,294 --> 01:18:50,760
Ouch. Jamal,
you wanna bite?

1525
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,696
Jamal, Jamal.

1526
01:18:54,698 --> 01:18:57,098
Let's see. What do I need?

1527
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,833
I need a stu,

1528
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:00,467
Frank, and a Hugo.

1529
01:19:07,108 --> 01:19:08,574
There's Hugo.

1530
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:10,842
Who is it? I can't tell.
It looks like stu or Hugo.

1531
01:19:12,145 --> 01:19:13,577
Frankie.

1532
01:19:13,579 --> 01:19:14,678
You suck.

1533
01:19:16,814 --> 01:19:19,147
But you're gonna have to do, buddy.

1534
01:19:19,149 --> 01:19:20,414
How many has he got now?

1535
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:22,449
He's got one...

1536
01:19:22,451 --> 01:19:24,350
Seven, eight.
He's got all eight.

1537
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:25,818
I want to make him the ninth head.

1538
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:27,019
You...

1539
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:30,555
You, I definitely don't need.

1540
01:19:32,425 --> 01:19:34,358
What a bunch of douche bags.

1541
01:19:37,162 --> 01:19:38,561
The lost dreams.

1542
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,062
What a crock.

1543
01:19:44,934 --> 01:19:48,168
Hey, this coyote won't be
doing any more running away.

1544
01:19:48,803 --> 01:19:50,569
I got him trained.

1545
01:20:10,186 --> 01:20:13,053
That is disgusting.

1546
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,422
I can't leave it outside for the coyotes.

1547
01:20:15,424 --> 01:20:17,424
All right.

1548
01:20:17,426 --> 01:20:20,059
Everybody be still.
This is the last match.

1549
01:20:24,999 --> 01:20:28,133
Good work, Steve.
You ass.

1550
01:20:28,135 --> 01:20:30,935
That's it. Just gonna
have to wait till dawn.

1551
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:40,743
Steve, shut up.

1552
01:20:42,113 --> 01:20:43,378
Heads up!

1553
01:20:43,913 --> 01:20:45,379
Stop ahead.

1554
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:46,880
Anybody need to use the head?

1555
01:20:51,052 --> 01:20:53,018
Steve, shut up and go to sleep.

1556
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,220
Don't let it go to your head.

1557
01:20:55,222 --> 01:20:57,288
You're way ahead of me.

1558
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:58,822
Steve!

1559
01:20:58,824 --> 01:21:01,224
Hey, don't bite my head off, all right?

1560
01:21:03,094 --> 01:21:05,694
That's it. I'm sleeping outside, guys.
Me, too.

1561
01:21:05,696 --> 01:21:08,129
Steve. Get a grip.

1562
01:21:08,898 --> 01:21:09,997
Go to sleep.

1563
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,631
Or what?

1564
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:13,432
You'll have my head?

1565
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:16,535
Enough.

1566
01:21:38,056 --> 01:21:41,023

Benny, Benny,
wake up. Wake up.

1590
01:22:37,936 --> 01:22:39,368
He's up. He's up.
He's up.

1591
01:22:41,772 --> 01:22:43,238
Damn it.

1592
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,240
This always works on a Camaro.

1593
01:22:45,242 --> 01:22:46,774
You can do it.

1594
01:22:46,776 --> 01:22:48,242
All right.

1595
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:22,908
Can I get some breakfast here?

1596
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:25,276
<i>Si, senor.</i> Please sit
anywhere you'd like.

1597
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,712
Benny, what the hell's he doing?

1598
01:23:28,714 --> 01:23:31,380
I don't know. Let's go find out, shall we?

1599
01:23:32,316 --> 01:23:33,682
Coffee, <i>senor?</i>

1600
01:23:33,684 --> 01:23:35,216
Yeah.

1601
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:36,784
Juice?
Sure.

1602
01:23:53,669 --> 01:23:56,102
Wow. Look at this surprise.

1603
01:23:56,104 --> 01:23:57,970
Benny, Rico.

1604
01:23:57,972 --> 01:24:00,205
You boys decide to take a vacation?

1605
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,941
Yeah, Tommy. You know, we never seen Mexico.

1606
01:24:02,943 --> 01:24:05,410
We kind of figured this would be a
good time to check it out, you know.

1607
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:08,546
Good, good.
It's nice down here.

1608
01:24:08,548 --> 01:24:11,582
Look, I know you're waiting for
me to cross over to the states.

1609
01:24:11,584 --> 01:24:13,016
I gotta tell you now.

1610
01:24:13,018 --> 01:24:16,386
When I do, you get that bag

1611
01:24:16,388 --> 01:24:18,421
over my dead body.

1612
01:24:18,423 --> 01:24:21,757
Funny. We was thinking that
exact same thing, Rico?

1613
01:24:21,759 --> 01:24:22,759
Yeah.

1614
01:24:28,198 --> 01:24:30,031
That's his van.

1615
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:35,368
Hey! The guy with the van, where is he?

1616
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,269
He's in the hotel, <i>senor.</i>

1617
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:39,137
You're not going in there
after him, are you?

1618
01:24:39,139 --> 01:24:40,304
We need those heads.

1619
01:24:40,306 --> 01:24:42,906
Yes, I'm going in there.

1620
01:24:42,908 --> 01:24:44,841
I can't believe you're actually doing this.

1621
01:25:06,363 --> 01:25:08,363
Give me your guns.

1622
01:25:08,365 --> 01:25:10,231
Jesus, Charlie, where'd you get that?

1623
01:25:10,233 --> 01:25:11,599
Looks like mine's.

1624
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:13,334
It was yours. You dropped it in the desert.

1625
01:25:13,336 --> 01:25:15,002
Now it's mine.

1626
01:25:15,004 --> 01:25:17,037
Now both of you put your guns on the table,

1627
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:19,004
or I'm gonna blow your heads off.

1628
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:21,839
Right now!

1629
01:25:27,178 --> 01:25:28,877
Laurie, get the guns.

1630
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:33,981
Ernie, get the duffel bag.

1631
01:25:33,983 --> 01:25:36,450
Wait a minute. Easy, kid. You don't
want to mess with these guys.

1632
01:25:36,452 --> 01:25:39,786
He's right, Charlie. What do you
want those heads for, anyway?

1633
01:25:39,788 --> 01:25:41,320
He's gonna take them to the border

1634
01:25:41,322 --> 01:25:42,954
and turn them in, right, Charlie?

1635
01:25:42,956 --> 01:25:44,355
He'll be a hero with her old man.

1636
01:25:44,357 --> 01:25:45,489
Something like that.

1637
01:25:45,491 --> 01:25:46,890
Forget about it.

1638
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,658
You do that, and big sep kills us all.

1639
01:25:51,294 --> 01:25:52,693
Fuck big sep.

1640
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:58,998
Miss Bennett, <i>senor</i> pritchett.

1641
01:25:59,633 --> 01:26:00,665
Paco.

1642
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:05,769
We're FBI.

1643
01:26:06,571 --> 01:26:08,403
He's the unabellman.

1644
01:26:12,274 --> 01:26:13,706
<i>Senora</i> Bennett.

1645
01:26:17,577 --> 01:26:18,943
Back off.

1646
01:26:22,714 --> 01:26:24,313
Come on!

1647
01:26:24,315 --> 01:26:25,480
He's getting away. Big sep's
gonna kill us, Benny.

1648
01:26:25,482 --> 01:26:26,881
Come on! Let's go!

1649
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:29,716
Come on, Laurie.
Drive faster.

1650
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:31,451
Why do you have a gun?

1651
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:33,719
Laurie, why do you have a gun? What? What?

1652
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:35,887
What's happening?
What's this all about?

1653
01:26:35,889 --> 01:26:37,588
It's about heads.

1654
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:39,256
Hey, Steve, leave him alone.

1655
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:43,192
Look, look, look, look, look, look.

1656
01:26:49,999 --> 01:26:51,965
I told you it wasn't recyclable.

1657
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:54,467
Paco, it's okay.
It's okay, paco. <i>Si.</i>

1658
01:27:03,377 --> 01:27:05,510
Charlie, what are we gonna do?

1659
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,011
Charlie?

1660
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:08,973
What are you doing? Ernie,
give me the duffel bag.

1661
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,281
Everybody stay in the car.

1662
01:27:13,283 --> 01:27:15,249
Steve, stay in the car!

1663
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,585
Move, please. Move!

1664
01:27:18,587 --> 01:27:20,887
I need to get through.

1665
01:27:20,889 --> 01:27:22,455
Laurie!

1666
01:27:24,692 --> 01:27:27,325
Hey, does this mean anything to anybody?

1667
01:27:29,262 --> 01:27:30,928
I have something to declare.

1668
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:33,397
Hey, hey, hey.
It's a mistake.

1669
01:27:33,399 --> 01:27:34,531
He doesn't have anything.

1670
01:27:34,533 --> 01:27:37,167
Arrest them!
Arrest them!

1671
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,502
That's his bag.
Arrest them.

1672
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,070
Charlie!

1673
01:27:42,072 --> 01:27:44,305
All right!
Everybody freeze.

1674
01:27:44,307 --> 01:27:45,706
Don't do anything stupid,

1675
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,140
and nothing stupid will happen.

1676
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:49,142
Get to the plane.
Shit.

1677
01:27:53,348 --> 01:27:55,247
No need to be excited.

1678
01:27:55,249 --> 01:27:57,515
We're just...
We're gonna get in the plane

1679
01:27:57,517 --> 01:27:59,817
and fly away. Bye-bye.

1680
01:27:59,819 --> 01:28:01,351
Have a nice day.

1681
01:28:02,487 --> 01:28:03,819
Arrest them!

1682
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:05,020
Drop your guns, or I'm gonna shoot him.

1683
01:28:05,022 --> 01:28:06,755
Move in, God damn it!
Move in!

1684
01:28:06,757 --> 01:28:08,356
No!

1685
01:28:08,358 --> 01:28:10,691
Charlie, no!

1686
01:28:11,894 --> 01:28:13,093
Arrest them!

1687
01:28:13,095 --> 01:28:15,028
Check their bag.
Open the bag.

1688
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:16,295
There's...

1689
01:28:16,297 --> 01:28:17,629
There's a human head in the bag.

1690
01:28:24,237 --> 01:28:26,136
The man you arrested yesterday is in jail

1691
01:28:26,138 --> 01:28:27,737
for the murders these guys committed.

1692
01:28:27,739 --> 01:28:29,605
Her father's innocent.

1693
01:28:29,607 --> 01:28:31,606
These are the guys that did it.

1694
01:28:33,242 --> 01:28:34,574
Right there.

1695
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:38,043
Wait a minute.
That's not ours.

1696
01:28:38,045 --> 01:28:40,111
You arrested us for the
wrong head here. Rico!

1697
01:28:40,113 --> 01:28:41,879
All our heads had hair.
Shut up.

1698
01:28:41,881 --> 01:28:44,381
Where are our heads, asshole?
Shut up, Rico!

1699
01:28:44,383 --> 01:28:45,615
I said shut up.

1700
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:47,583
I told you.
They set us up, Benny.

1701
01:29:03,332 --> 01:29:04,964
You knew it?
You planned it?

1702
01:29:20,714 --> 01:29:22,180
You got a future, kid.

1703
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:24,682
Thanks.

1704
01:29:45,804 --> 01:29:48,171
Sleight of bag by Charlie pritchett.

Show me the law about bringing
a head out of the country!

1706
01:29:56,514 --> 01:29:57,813
Shut up, Rico!

1707
01:29:57,815 --> 01:29:59,581
It ain't a fruit, it ain't a vegetable!

1708
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:01,983
It ain't a native plant, God damn it!

1709
01:30:13,394 --> 01:30:15,761
You can't have it!
It's mine!

1710
01:30:15,763 --> 01:30:18,363
I spent a long time on this head!

1711
01:30:18,365 --> 01:30:20,198
