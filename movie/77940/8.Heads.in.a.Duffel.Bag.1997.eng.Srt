1
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,204
Die, scumbags

2
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:34,892
You know, you're late, Tommy

3
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:36,685
Rico, relax

4
00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:39,897
Okay, then, okay,
you're the boss, come on

5
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:41,732
That's Hugo Porto's mob, huh?

6
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:44,860
He tried to move in on Big
Sep's territory down in Atlantic City

7
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,571
Killed Victor Viking's
mom in the process

8
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:49,489
Wow, what a bunch of scumbags, huh?

9
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:53,577
Whatever, and there's proof for Big
Sep, you got a ticket on the red-eye

10
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:56,079
The heads are nice and
clean and ready to go, okay?

11
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:57,456
Okay

12
00:01:57,623 --> 00:01:59,833
Tommy, Big Sep's hot

13
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,294
I'm two weeks
late delivering the meat

14
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,047
If he doesn't get that by noon
tomorrow, more heads are gonna roll

15
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:07,174
- You know what I mean?
- No problem

16
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:14,765
Do you love me?

17
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:40,290
- Where you headed? San Diego?
- Mexico

18
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,668
- You have a good flight
- Thanks a lot

19
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:47,213
Do you love me? Do you love me?

20
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,049
Do you love me? Do you love me?

21
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,893
How you doing?

22
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:15,366
Thank you, thanks

23
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,839
Step over here please

24
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,885
Gun! She's got a gun!

25
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,310
I don't even own a gun!

26
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:04,874
- Hey, kid, is this yours?
- Yeah

27
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,751
Do me a favor, will you?
Put that right under the seat

28
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,837
And see maybe if you
can keep that right near you

29
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,714
I got some
important stuff in this bag

30
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:14,633
I'd like to keep it close by
me, you know what I mean?

31
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,972
Thanks, that's really nice of you

32
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:24,268
- Good kid, thank you
- Okay

33
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,190
Atta boy, fits right under there

34
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,568
No, it doesn't fit right under there

35
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:35,654
Maybe you can get a spot in
another bin, thanks, I appreciate that

36
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:37,239
It's nice of you

37
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,097
Excuse me

38
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,141
Careful, careful

39
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:10,814
I almost didn't make it

40
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:12,983
Well, I'm sure that
someone is glad you did

41
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:15,360
Let's see, 49C, right down this way

42
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,945
Thanks

43
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,252
- Excuse me, sir, is this yours?
- Yeah

44
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,713
I'm sorry, we'll need
to use this compartment

45
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:36,423
Would you mind using another one?

46
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:39,134
Because I have
valuable family heirlooms in there

47
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:42,929
Sir, as you can plainly see,
this is an emergency situation

48
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:44,889
Well, maybe you can
use somebody else's bin

49
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,266
I mean, this kid's not using all of his

50
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,559
Would you mind if
they used some of yours?

51
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,227
Hey, excuse me, but screw you

52
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:52,272
Hey, hey, come on,
be nice, be a gentleman, will you?

53
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:54,607
We're trying to help over here,
here, let me help you

54
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,444
This goes right
over here, it's small

55
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,863
That's okay, thanks, don't... don't?

56
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,447
Wait! Wait! Don't kick it!

57
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,825
For God's sake,
those are live human organs!

58
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:06,494
Trust me, pal, they don't feel it

59
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:10,039
Would you sit down please?

60
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,293
Sir, I'm really sorry about that

61
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:16,671
- Sir, we're gonna have to use your bin
- Excuse me? but?

62
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:19,382
And actually, sir, I think
your bag is over the size limit

63
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:23,428
Well, no, because see, the guy outside
measured this and he said that it was okay

64
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:26,681
Sir, it's clearly over the size
limit, it will have to go in cargo

65
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:28,558
Listen, wait a minute, wait a minute?

66
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,810
Hold on, hold on a second, listen

67
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,481
Maybe we could just leave
my bag where it is, all right?

68
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,525
Are you trying to bribe me, sir?

69
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:40,153
No. I'm trying to purchase
a place for my bag, which I already...

70
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:42,446
The place for your bag is in cargo, sir

71
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:45,116
Excuse me, maybe
I'll just take another flight

72
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:48,244
Fine, the next flight to
San Diego leaves in seven hours, sir

73
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:49,620
All right, let me make a phone call

74
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:53,666
Sir, do you actually think that we're gonna
hold the plane while you use the phone

75
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,751
Now, are you flying with us tonight or not?

76
00:06:57,712 --> 00:06:59,422
- All right, Miss Burke?
- Yes

77
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:01,007
- That's your name, right?
- Yes

78
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:04,176
This bag better be in San Diego,
you'll be in a lot of trouble if it's not

79
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,303
Yes, sir, it will be the very first off the plane

80
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:07,930
Does that make you happy?

81
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,974
- When it's there, then I'll be happy
- Okay

82
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,976
Have a seat, sir, thank you

83
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:19,024
Happy? Yeah, I'm happy, I'm thrilled

84
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,235
Happy

85
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:23,779
What are you looking at?

86
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:26,156
You started all this with those friggin' organs

87
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,285
You're happy, right?
Happy, who's happy?

88
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:41,588
Look, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, I'm Charlie

89
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:50,055
So, where you headed?

90
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:53,016
I'm gonna meet my girlfriend's parents

91
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:57,896
She races these cars

92
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:02,109
She's great, she's great!

93
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,862
I wish her parents thought the same of me,
I'm on my way to meet them for the first time

94
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:08,532
I haven't seen her in like six months, and...

95
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:09,741
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go to sleep

96
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,618
Think about what
you're gonna say to them, okay?

97
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:13,745
Yeah, I don't know, because
I mean I haven't even met them

98
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,581
Already the father,
he doesn't like me, I know

99
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:19,251
I could understand that,
I just met you and I don't like you either

100
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,503
I got to sleep, didn't
you hear me? Come on

101
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:23,755
I'm just trying to make conversation, but...

102
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,590
Good, make it in sign language

103
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:42,023
Laurie?

104
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,489
- Something wrong?
- No

105
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,991
- You look great
- Thanks

106
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,789
- What is the matter?
- Nothing, let's talk about it later

107
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,876
Okay

108
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:35,368
Oh, no. No, Jesus, please, no!

109
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:42,375
Charlie Pritchett! Shit!

110
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,837
What do you have in there?
It looks like you packed for a month

111
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,214
You know me, ready for anything

112
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:52,843
- Oh, boy, look at this loser
- Honey! Be nice now, come on

113
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,013
Charlie, these are my parents,
Annette and Dick

114
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,557
- Annette
- Charlie, it's a real pleasure

115
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:02,436
Dick, very nice to meet you, this is for you

116
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,856
Oh, these wrappings
are beautiful, thank you

117
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,818
Oh, my God! Dick, I left yours on the plane...

118
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:10,528
No, no, no, why don't you call the airlines?

119
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,696
We got a long ride,
we've got to make tracks

120
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,823
Sorry

121
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,325
Woodgy, why don't
you ride shotgun with your dad?

122
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:20,371
Wudji? Wudji like me to drive?

123
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,584
I think I can handle it

124
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,383
No... no... Jesus

125
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,231
House of pain

126
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,110
- Yeah, hello, who's this?
- This is Qaddafi, who's this?

127
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:56,532
Qaddafi, huh? Listen, this is Bill,
I'm an old friend of Charlie Pritchett's

128
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,368
I was wondering
if you could help me find him

129
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,912
Yeah, he's gone on spring
break with the rest of America

130
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,374
- Did you try looking in Mexico?
- That's very funny

131
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,709
Look, this is really important

132
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,087
You think you could be
a little more specific, Qaddafi?

133
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,172
Not unless it's for a grade

134
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,258
Hey, Bill, is it? Tell me if
this sounds like a phone hanging up

135
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,262
Yeah! Shit! Shit!

136
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,604
I need a flight to Bethesda University

137
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,358
I'm not sure the University
has their own airport

138
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,944
But we can fly you to Baltimore, will that do?

139
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,029
Hey, don't get cute with me, asshole, huh?

140
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,342
Wake up, people, we're here!
Made it in record time

141
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,304
- I'm famished
- Oh, me too

142
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,182
Boy, could I use a Margarita, what time is it?

143
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,684
Thirteen fifty hours

144
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,230
Bear, remember what
we agreed about your drinking?

145
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,566
You be a good bear,
take one of your new pills

146
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,360
They make me woozy, Wooly

147
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,196
Besides, I said I could use a drink,
I didn't say I'm having one

148
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,742
Listen, there is absolutely
nothing in this whole world

149
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,745
That could ever, ever make
me take a drink again

150
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,790
So, relax, okay?

151
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,627
- Bienvenidos! Welcome back, senior
- Hola, Juan

152
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,295
Hope you catch some big ones this time

153
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,676
Gracias, gracias

154
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,930
- Manny, I ran into a little delay here
- What do you mean, a delay?

155
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,389
Excuse me, are you going to be long?

156
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,558
- A day, maybe two
- On the phone?

157
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,144
What? What the hell's happened, Tommy?

158
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,897
Manny, I can't go into it
right now but it's going to be okay

159
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,066
All right? I mean, can't you talk to Big Sep?

160
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,319
Big Sep is riding me like a
race horse, I told you if it was late...

161
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,280
Listen, the job is finished,
so what's the big deal with the delivery?

162
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,033
Tommy, you didn't lose nothing, did you?

163
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,036
Manny, you know how many
years I did this for your father?

164
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,954
How could you even ask
me something like that?

165
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,122
Mister?

166
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,666
Hey, lady, you interrupt me one
more time, you're gonna swallow this phone

167
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,876
Now get out of here

168
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,544
Go ahead, take it on the heels

169
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,172
One day, you got one day, Tommy

170
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,301
If big Sep doesn't get those
heads in his hands by noon tomorrow

171
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,138
You might as well chop off your own
head and put it in with the others, capish?

172
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,974
Don't worry about it, all right?
He'll have them before they start stinking

173
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,728
- Please or you'll be stinking
- Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean

174
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,522
- About time
- Yeah, I know

175
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,025
Here, it's all yours

176
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:44,114
We've done a lot of redecorating
since you've been here, senor

177
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,492
It's quite lovely, we hope you enjoy it

178
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,329
- It's beautiful
- Senor Pritchett... your room

179
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,917
Thank you

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,169
The mini-bar, el bano, the bathroom

181
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,046
If you need anything, please call me

182
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:00,881
Everybody unpack later

183
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:03,550
They're only serving lunch
downstairs for ten more minutes

184
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,469
- Yes sir, no problem
- Good

185
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,013
Pepe, venga! Pepe, venga!

186
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,683
- Come on, Bear
- I'm coming, Wooly

187
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,269
It's 206, room 206

188
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,987
Okay, Laurie, what's going on?

189
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,282
Not now, let' just talk about it later, okay?

190
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,993
No, let's talk about it now

191
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,501
Look, Charlie,
I don't know quite how to put this

192
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:41,630
But... I think I want a divorce

193
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:48,595
What? A divorce? We're not
even married, we're not even engaged

194
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,430
You know what I mean

195
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,557
That's why you invited me here?
To tell me this?

196
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,100
I thought you invited me to meet your parents

197
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,311
I didn't really actually invite you

198
00:14:56,728 --> 00:15:00,940
Excuse me, but you
invited me to your parents' house

199
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:04,027
And then you called and said
we were coming to Mexico instead

200
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,988
When I said we were going to Mexico,
I didn't actually mean you

201
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:08,948
What?!

202
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,701
It was just supposed to be me
and my parents for my dad's birthday

203
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,914
And you got so excited;
I didn't know how to break it to you

204
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,085
Laurie, what's happened to you?

205
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,838
Six months at home and you've mutated

206
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,760
From a fun-loving free spirit
into... Nancy Reagan

207
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:32,639
Look, I just want stability in my life, Charlie

208
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:35,725
I need to be with someone
who really knows who they are

209
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,478
And knows what they want in life

210
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,939
You know what this is all about? Your folks

211
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:46,027
They don't like me, and it's
affecting the way that you feel about me

212
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:47,820
But just wait, Laurie

213
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:51,032
My being here will turn
out to be a blessing in disguise

214
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:55,411
I'm not giving up on you, Laurie

215
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:58,789
- Is my hair all right?
- I am open-minded

216
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,499
It's just that he's such a dip!

217
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,543
Do you think he's a dip?
I think he's really cute

218
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,629
And he seems funny, and he seems smart

219
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:06,589
I mean, what do you want for Laurie?

220
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:09,425
I want what I was when I was his age

221
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,596
- I was charismatic, ambitious...
- That's right

222
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,474
- I was clearly headed to the top
- Clearly, darling

223
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,267
The very, very top

224
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:23,939
I mean, we can be honest with
each other when we're alone, can't we?

225
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,858
Oh, I think that's a good idea, Wooly

226
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,777
I've always wanted to be...

227
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:30,863
Oh, I forgot something,
will you go down and get us a table?

228
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,281
- What's the problem?
- No problem, no problem

229
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:34,992
I just forgot something and
I'll be there in just a second

230
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,702
Okay? I'm running

231
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:21,097
Senorita, no, no, it's for decoration,
not for sale, sorry

232
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:31,649
I better go check on Bear

233
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,862
- Ah, Mrs. Bennett
- There you are, Bear

234
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,739
We ordered you an enchilada

235
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:48,875
- Bear, are you all right?
- Mrs. Bennett?

236
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,753
Jesus! Ma, are you okay?

237
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:56,340
- Would you, would you like to... to sit?
- Mom, what are you doing?

238
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:02,013
Good God, Bear, don't tell
me you've been drinking again

239
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,849
Now, remember what the
doctor said, take nice deep breaths

240
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:08,853
- I have some pills if you're not feeling well
- Yeah, why don't you take some?

241
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:15,776
It's, it's, it's... all right, folks

242
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:19,864
She's just a little hungry, she's
hungry and her blood sugar's dropped

243
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:22,700
Are you hungry, Bear?

244
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:27,288
- Mom, for God's sake?
- Would you like an enchilada?

245
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:35,504
It's all right, folks! No harm done

246
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,423
They're just happy to see each other

247
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:10,247
You little son of a bitch, I should have known

248
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:02,924
Wake up, Qaddafi,
we're gonna play College Bowl

249
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,719
For ten points of your life...

250
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:09,055
Hey Stevie, you got any notes
from last night? I don't need them

251
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,099
Hey!

252
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:14,352
No, no, I've got it, thank you very much

253
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:19,190
Seniorita, your mother is going to be fine

254
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,985
Take this please

255
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,280
Senor, I gave her a sedative,
it's muy, muy strong

256
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:27,657
- Let her rest, huh?
- Thank you, doctor

257
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:32,370
We've only been back here
an hour and already she's on the booze

258
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:35,540
Would you go easy on her, dad?
She's obviously under a lot of stress

259
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,626
Okay

260
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,255
When she wakes up, we
won't mention a thing, okay, Laurie?

261
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:47,427
Why don't you watch her, while Charlie
and I go rent a boat for tomorrow?

262
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:50,179
- Okay, Charlie?
- Yeah, great

263
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,141
Is my hair okay?

264
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:01,899
Uh, do, do you mind if
l change my shirt before we go?

265
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,903
No, I'll use the phone in
your room so I don't disturb her

266
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:12,618
All right, we're gonna play
a game called Be Honest With Me?

267
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:15,454
Now, the rules are very simple

268
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:20,209
l ask you a question and you
have to be honest with me, okay?

269
00:22:20,668 --> 00:22:23,879
Now, where did
Charlie Pritchett go on vacation?

270
00:22:24,547 --> 00:22:28,175
Second rule, you have to answer, Qaddafi

271
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,596
- Why does he keep calling you Qaddafi?
- I don't know

272
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,268
Now, look, I don't want to have
to put you kids through hell

273
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,356
So let me tell you
what's going to happen here

274
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:46,402
First, I'm gonna hurt you,
then you're gonna try to be brave

275
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:50,072
Then I'm gonna hurt you again,
and you're gonna tell me everything

276
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:55,119
That's not being honest, that's not honest

277
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:57,079
That's not honest!

278
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:02,751
Now, look, this is not gonna get
any easier, it's only gonna get harder

279
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:07,047
So, I don't know why you're protecting
this kid, because I'm gonna find him

280
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:10,509
There we go, atta boy

281
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:14,513
l swear to God, we don't know where he is
all he said was Mexico and he's ...

282
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,181
Come on!

283
00:23:16,306 --> 00:23:18,433
We're not trying to protect him!

284
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,311
I'm not going to repeat myself!

285
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:29,152
Mom, if you want to come down,
you're certainly welcome

286
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:31,238
It's just that the weather is terrible

287
00:23:32,197 --> 00:23:35,200
Well, it's rained since we got here,
mom, there are storms everywhere

288
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:37,494
l mean more storms are on the way

289
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:39,413
Mom, I'm just thinking about you

290
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:43,709
Mom, l... we..., of course we'd
love to have your company, mom

291
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:47,045
Well, I know you're young enough
to travel, it has nothing to do with that

292
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:51,716
Mom... mom, please, please,
mom, please don't dredge that up

293
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:57,180
What's the matter? Are you okay?

294
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,516
l, uh, uh, ants, ants everywhere

295
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:02,727
Ants' I don't see any ants,
what are you talking about?

296
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:05,105
Mom, there are ants
down here, ants everywhere

297
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:08,233
Mom, please don't dredge that up

298
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:10,568
Because it's got nothing to do with her

299
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,072
What is it? What is it?

300
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:18,618
- I have a cramp in my leg
- A cramp?

301
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:20,412
Ay, ah!

302
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:22,288
Well, pull yourself together, stop screaming

303
00:24:22,414 --> 00:24:24,457
I'm, I'm sorry, I'm...

304
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,210
No, mom, I'm not arguing with my wife,
I'm arguing with you

305
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:30,213
l mean, mom, mom, please,
I'll have to call you back

306
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:32,382
Mom, I'll call you back, I'll call you right back

307
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:34,425
Can you keep it down?

308
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:37,053
Now, why don't I meet you downstairs
in the lobby in say, five minutes?

309
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,263
- Five minutes?
- All right?

310
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,514
Five minutos!

311
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:42,517
And don't send this laundry out,
it's gonna cost me an arm and a leg!

312
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:50,692
yeah!

313
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:58,908
Oh, yeah! Obviously, this is, this isn't real

314
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:07,375
It's a, it's, it's a fake, it's a fake

315
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:12,255
God! God!

316
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,467
Senor! Senor!

317
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:20,805
- Are you okay?
- I am fine

318
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:23,266
l just, I ate a hot pepper

319
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:26,519
- Oh, ah, hot pepper
- Venga, Pepe

320
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:28,145
No, no, no

321
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:30,398
Charlie, are you okay?

322
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:32,817
I'm fine, I just ate a killer pepper

323
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:35,236
A chili pepper, I'm fine

324
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,196
There's some water in the mini-bar, senor

325
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,908
No, no, no
l like the sensation

326
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,161
I' yee haw! Yee haw!

327
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:46,372
Enchilada!

328
00:25:47,498 --> 00:25:50,793
Okay, well you call me
if you need anything, eh?

329
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:53,754
- Will do, thank you, Paco
- Pepe, venga!

330
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:55,923
Pepe, come on! Pepe!

331
00:25:57,007 --> 00:25:58,968
- God!
- Charlie, what's going on?

332
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:01,679
The police, this has
got to be a setup! Oh, God!

333
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,138
There's got to be a camera or something

334
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:05,432
We're in Mexico, why would
there be a camera in Mexico?

335
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:07,851
Mexican Candid Camera, still on the air!

336
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:11,188
Charlie! You're acting insane!

337
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,107
- I'm okay
- Would you get it together?

338
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:15,067
- Okay?
- I'm okay

339
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:17,319
What the hell is going on?

340
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:21,448
Look, Laurie, you gotta
promise you won't freak, okay?

341
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,117
Okay

342
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,286
I found something in my duffel bag

343
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:32,417
Something, oh... I mean, look, it's a...

344
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:36,672
- What?
- Forget it, it's nothing, it's nothing

345
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:41,343
- Charlie Pritchett, you're such a sneak
- No!

346
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:43,720
You got me a present,
I didn't know you got me one

347
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,973
No! No! It's not a present Laurie!

348
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:47,933
Laurie, don't open it, it's a head

349
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:54,439
Laurie

350
00:26:55,023 --> 00:26:56,483
Laurie!

351
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:59,069
Are you okay? Honey, are you all right?

352
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:00,403
Yeah

353
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,708
- Senora, are you all right?
- She's fine, everything's fine

354
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:17,504
She had a pepper too,
she loves them, actually, she'll be fine

355
00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:19,089
Are you sure, senorita?

356
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:25,762
Pepe, Pepe, venga

357
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,014
Pepe, venga!

358
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,143
Pepe!

359
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,104
Pepe, andale! Vamos

360
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:36,106
Pepe!

361
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:40,777
You call me if you need anything, eh?

362
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,030
Will do, thank you, Paco, bye-bye

363
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:46,824
All right

364
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:52,372
Laurie, are you okay?
Can you stop screaming?

365
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,960
Good God, Charlie, what are
you doing with a head in your bag?

366
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,753
I don't know, you think I know?

367
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:03,091
Yes, I think you'd know
If I had a head in my bag, I think I'd know

368
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:07,178
Laurie, Laurie, don't get
upset but there's more than one

369
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,556
What? Charlie, there's two?

370
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:14,560
- No
- Three? Four? How many?

371
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,147
Eight?

372
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:25,821
It's those gringos, son locos

373
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:28,866
Laurie, you're not in the hall,
you're in the closet

374
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,618
Don't you think I realize that?

375
00:28:30,785 --> 00:28:33,079
- Laurie
- I'm not coming out

376
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,247
- Laurie!
- I'm not!

377
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:38,793
- You have to come out!
- No!

378
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,294
The bodies are in there

379
00:28:42,838 --> 00:28:45,883
I was... I was kidding, I was kidding

380
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:49,136
Kidding? You're kidding at a time like this?

381
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:51,180
Well, I had to calm you down

382
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,265
For God's sake, Laurie,
try to stay calm, okay?

383
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:55,392
Calm? You expect me to remain calm

384
00:28:55,476 --> 00:28:57,561
When you have eight human
heads in your luggage?

385
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:02,775
Laurie, there may be two people
in China who didn't hear you

386
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:07,571
- Then what the hell is going on?
- I wish I knew

387
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:13,869
Could it be Steve or Ernie playing
some sort of sick, hideous, medical prank?

388
00:29:13,994 --> 00:29:16,914
I don't think so,
the thought of blood bothers Steve

389
00:29:16,997 --> 00:29:18,957
And this isn't Ernie's style

390
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:23,796
They're my best friends, but
come on, they're dull guys with dull lives

391
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:27,132
You psycho! You psycho!

392
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:29,009
We don't know anything!

393
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:31,136
I don't know shit!

394
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,888
You're right

395
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:35,682
Besides, the only heads we
have access to are cadavers

396
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:38,101
- And these heads are fresh
- Charlie!

397
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:40,270
I'm sorry, but it's true,
check it out for yourself

398
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:41,438
No!

399
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:45,192
- Let's call the police
- No! No! No!

400
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,445
- Why?
- Because we're in Mexico, Laurie

401
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:52,407
A third world country. You don't just
call the police in a third world country

402
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:54,534
And tell them you found
eight human heads in your luggage

403
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:57,746
- Why not?
- Because they have no laws here!

404
00:29:58,205 --> 00:30:01,541
- They'll turn me into a taco!
- All right, what do you suggest then?

405
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,546
We have to think this thing through rationally

406
00:30:06,755 --> 00:30:09,132
- Okay?
- Oh, my God, Charlie

407
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:11,593
- What if they have your bag?
- What?

408
00:30:11,718 --> 00:30:15,138
Your bag! What if the person
who owns this bag has your bag?

409
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:17,140
They're going to come looking for you

410
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,730
Laurie, I just took
a mental inventory of my bag

411
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:26,775
There's no... there's nothing in that
bag that could possibly lead them here

412
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,487
His family lives in Clarion, Vermont!
They're in the furniture business

413
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,655
Laurie is from Denver! Last name, Bennett

414
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:36,159
B-e-n-n-e-t-t!

415
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:38,787
On vacation in Mexico

416
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,833
Okay, that's reassuring
What do we do?

417
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:49,088
Simple! All we have
to do is throw them away

418
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,772
They lock the garbage

419
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,361
Senor Pritchett?

420
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:16,074
- Ah, Paco
- Can I help you?

421
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:22,038
No, no, I was just putting the,
the, the trash in the garbage

422
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,957
Putting the garbage in the trash, you know?

423
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,542
- I'll take it for you
- No, no, I got it

424
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:29,420
- What is it?
- It's? it's none of your business

425
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,466
No, Senor, I meant what kind
of garbage is it? Aluminum? Plastic?

426
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,009
We recycle here

427
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:39,597
It's, it's really not recyclable,
it's, it's perishable

428
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:43,934
- Oh, well, perishables we compost
- It's really not compostable

429
00:31:44,143 --> 00:31:47,772
Sure it is!
Everything perishable is compostable

430
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:50,316
Jesus Christ!

431
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,735
I mean, come on!

432
00:31:52,902 --> 00:31:56,906
I'm sorry, senor!
Go ahead and put it in

433
00:31:58,073 --> 00:32:01,994
- Thank you
- I'll take care of it later

434
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:07,791
Actually, you know what? It's fine
I'll just take it back

435
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:14,715
It's really not that bad. I just need
some oil and formaldehyde and vinegar

436
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,551
And it'll be just as good as...

437
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:21,805
- Are you sure, senor?
- Yes, thank you, Paco

438
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,103
Mom, why are you bringing
my inheritance into this?

439
00:32:28,604 --> 00:32:30,022
Excuse me!

440
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:32,775
You still haven't changed?
What are you doing?

441
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,110
- Well, l...
- No, not you, mom

442
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:38,489
I found a roa... roa... a rat in my room

443
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:40,449
And it had a ball of...

444
00:32:40,616 --> 00:32:43,118
I don't wanna be rude, but are you coming?

445
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:46,079
Or am I going to spend the entire
day waiting in the lobby for you?

446
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:48,290
I am so sorry, I'll be right down

447
00:33:00,177 --> 00:33:02,512
What am I going to do? Flush them?

448
00:33:04,056 --> 00:33:07,809
Nothing fits around here

449
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:13,815
No, no, no, por favor , no clean

450
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:16,860
No clean, room clean, no clean

451
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,404
- No clean
- No clean, gracias

452
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:22,240
No, I mean, I'm, I'm
asking you to come, mom

453
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:26,077
But there's really no need for you to come
Mom, it's two hundred degrees here

454
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:32,125
You go in here! Like that!

455
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:35,295
Mom, if we're cut off, it's the lightning

456
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,713
What?

457
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:49,726
Let's go rent a boat! I got 8 human heads
in my room and I gotta go rent a boat!

458
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,271
Okay

459
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:12,832
Mrs. Pritshett?

460
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:17,295
Hi, this is Ernie Lipscomb,
Charlie's friend from medical school

461
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,175
Oh! Great! Great! The number
of as many hotels as you can give me

462
00:34:22,508 --> 00:34:24,469
No, I know, it is, it is late

463
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,263
It's just that we've run into
a little bit of a situation up here

464
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:29,640
All right, okay, the Mayan

465
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:32,977
- That sounds great
- No, no, no, relax, everything's fine

466
00:34:33,227 --> 00:34:39,775
But I do need to get a hold of Charlie. Did
he tell you what hotel he was staying at?

467
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,324
He didn't...

468
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:50,161
Right, no, I know how sons can be

469
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:53,998
- All right, and that's the last one, right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good

470
00:34:54,123 --> 00:34:56,792
- School's a little crazy
- Well, thank you

471
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:58,419
You know how that goes

472
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:00,421
You sure he's only going away for a week?

473
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:04,049
- He packed enough stuff here for a year
- Charlie is a compulsive packer

474
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:08,095
"Sleight of Mind" by
Charlie Pritchett again

475
00:35:08,262 --> 00:35:10,514
He's writing a detective novel

476
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:13,225
Yeah, it sounds like
his autobiography

477
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:18,355
It's a pun on sleight on hand and dim-witted.
You know, a pun, play on words, get it?

478
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:23,235
No, no, no, relax. Everything's fine

479
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:30,159
No, I don't know
we got midterms

480
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:37,750
I'll talk to you soon, Mrs. Pritshett
gotta go, bye

481
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:47,134
I popped the last guy
who tried to pun me, asshole. Get it?

482
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:53,098
Yeah, I get it too.
Make some more calls

483
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:54,641
You too, asshole

484
00:35:57,394 --> 00:36:01,940
Charlie, this is none of my business,
hopefully... but, let's review

485
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:04,985
You've been pre-law,
pre-architect, pre-vet, pre-med...

486
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,070
- No, I'm in Med.
- He's an intern

487
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:09,281
And now Laurie tells me you've been
thinking about becoming a head-shrinker

488
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,953
- Charlie
- A... a what?

489
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:16,746
Shrink, headshrinker, psychoanalyst

490
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:20,208
Whatever you call an
overpaid hand-holder these days

491
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:26,214
Actually, sir, I was thinking about that...
but I don't know what I'm doing anymore

492
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:28,508
- I'm certainly aware of that
- Dad, enough...

493
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:54,826
Annette?

494
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:00,456
Bear?

495
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,211
- Wooly, are we alone?
- Yeah, we're alone, but where are you?

496
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,046
Wooly!

497
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:12,343
- What are you doing there?
- Wooly! Thank God Thank God you're alive!

498
00:37:12,427 --> 00:37:14,304
Still alive? Of course I'm still alive

499
00:37:14,554 --> 00:37:18,725
Where's Laurie? Not with him,
oh my God! Not with that maniac!

500
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:21,019
Calm down and tell me what
you're talking about

501
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:24,772
What I'm talking about?
Our daughter is dating a mass murderer

502
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:28,568
I went into his room
to take a gift to put it in his bag

503
00:37:28,735 --> 00:37:32,405
In his bag he's got body parts!

504
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:24,748
Senora Bennett, I sorry to scare you
I was fixing the gutter

505
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:34,049
Dick, I am not crazy!
I know what I saw!

506
00:38:34,216 --> 00:38:35,843
- I believe you
- No, you don't believe me

507
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,263
Yes, I do believe you, but remember
what the doctor said about your drinking

508
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,432
- I did not hallucinate
- Bear

509
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:43,934
I had the drink after I saw them
Please, Wooly

510
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:45,436
Bear, what about the pills?

511
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:48,689
I saw you take them, you said yourself
they made you woosy

512
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:54,987
Right, but then what about the bag?
Okay... where's the bag?

513
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:58,323
I don't know, but I was in his room
when he unpacked

514
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:01,326
He unpacked right in front of me
would a maniac do that?

515
00:39:13,714 --> 00:39:16,425
Oh, no! Oh, no!

516
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:21,179
No, no, no, no

517
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,486
It's not my room!
It's not my room!

518
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:40,949
It is my room, okay

519
00:39:47,122 --> 00:39:48,540
- Senor?
- What?

520
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:51,000
- We clean room
- What?

521
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,211
- Room clean
- Oh no!

522
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,513
Hola

523
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:05,515
- Oh! I am...
- Paco?

524
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:14,566
No... I'm... blind... I'm blind
I mean, I mean, you're blind...

525
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:19,737
I'm a guest and I forgot something

526
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:40,133
- Adios
- Adios

527
00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:24,843
- I draw the line on mass graves
- Mass graves?

528
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,390
You know, maybe we should just do
individuals, seven of them, you know?

529
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:33,477
This reminds me of when
I was a kid, I was thirteen years old

530
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:39,066
Me and my friends used to
rip the heads off Barbie dolls...

531
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,945
and burry them
in the mud in the backyard

532
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:45,906
- You used to rip the...
- Hola, amigos

533
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:51,286
Find any buried treasures, gringos?

534
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:54,581
We have laws about these deserts

535
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,460
They are environmentally protected now
you know

536
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:00,546
- Actually, no, we didn't know
- Si, si

537
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:04,466
We got protected snakes,
protected lizards

538
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:06,510
protected toads

539
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,972
Are you familiar with the
Mexican horny toad, chiquita?

540
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:12,683
- Oh, no
- Oh, yeah!

541
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:16,645
Mexican horny toad is a very special species

542
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:19,981
It's against the law
to hurt a horny toad in any way...

543
00:42:20,732 --> 00:42:23,902
Oh! You just hurt a horny toad!

544
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,573
Laurie

545
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:32,410
Whoa, come on, amigos. Vamanos!

546
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:37,749
- Are you all right?
- Yeah

547
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:45,423
No, shit! They stole my car!
Go get them!

548
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,845
- Senor
- Dick is going to kill me

549
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:55,850
I want you to stay here at your hotel

550
00:42:56,226 --> 00:42:57,769
- Okay
- You're much safer here

551
00:42:58,144 --> 00:43:01,064
- Okay, thank you
- Thank you

552
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:02,482
Thank you, sir

553
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:09,405
- Senor , you forgot your bag
- Thank you, thank you, sir

554
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:13,076
Thank you, good night

555
00:43:15,578 --> 00:43:17,330
Well, that went well

556
00:43:17,455 --> 00:43:20,541
- Charlie! I got it! Fed Ex it!
- What?

557
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,835
Fed Ex them to Steve!

558
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:26,005
Fed Ex them? Laurie, we're in Mexico
there is no Fed Ex

559
00:43:26,923 --> 00:43:30,635
Well, then, Mex Ex them, I don't care
the point is just ship them!

560
00:43:30,802 --> 00:43:33,513
And just let Steve innocently
open a package full of heads?

561
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:36,307
Of course not, we'll call him

562
00:43:37,642 --> 00:43:42,313
All right boys, I'd like
to do this forever but...

563
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:45,233
I'm sorry, I don't know what else to do
You know?

564
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:49,654
I think it's time that I got rid of you two and
moved along. Come on, come over here

565
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:53,324
What? you, you can't just kill us
We're trying, all right? We're trying...

566
00:43:53,407 --> 00:43:56,327
Trying? What are you talking about? What
does this look like the Special Olympics?

567
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,287
I need the bag! Get over here

568
00:43:58,412 --> 00:44:00,790
- Well, wait...
- Trying, shit, get down!

569
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:03,250
Listen, we can call more people or...

570
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:04,669
Yes, we can help, man

571
00:44:04,877 --> 00:44:06,879
I don't know what to do
I can go through friends

572
00:44:07,505 --> 00:44:09,965
Can I answer that?
It might be Charlie, all right?

573
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:12,885
Put it on speaker phone

574
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:16,597
- Hello?
- Steve

575
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:18,974
- Oh God!
- Oh, Charlie, thank God. Jesus!

576
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:21,894
Listen to me, you asshole, you got my heads
and I want them back, you understand?

577
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:23,646
Who is this?

578
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:26,190
Never mind who this is
I want those heads!

579
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:28,776
Jesus Christ!
You're the guy from the airplane!

580
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:30,152
Charlie, listen, listen...

581
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:32,655
What does this look like, a family reunion?

582
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,201
Steve? What are you doing to Steve?

583
00:44:37,576 --> 00:44:41,038
I'm killing him unless you
shut up and listen to me! Where are you?

584
00:44:41,288 --> 00:44:44,249
I'm in Baja
I'm six hours south of San Diego

585
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:48,462
Listen to me. You meet me at the San Diego
airport and bring all 8 heads with you

586
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:52,091
San Diego airport? I'm
on vacation with my girlfriend's parents

587
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:56,011
Okay, okay, San Diego

588
00:44:56,261 --> 00:45:00,933
You make sure you're there by six o'clock
if you ain't there, your buddies are history

589
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,854
- But what if I don't have all eight heads?
- What?

590
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:10,901
- I lost one
- You lost one?

591
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:13,904
You lost one?
How the hell could you lose one?

592
00:45:14,404 --> 00:45:16,073
The maid got it

593
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,117
What do you mean a maid got it?
How the hell did a maid...

594
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,161
What, what do you mean?
What, which one did you lose?

595
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:22,621
I don't know!

596
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:26,208
Oh Jesus! I can't
believe this shit! I can't believe this shit!

597
00:45:27,209 --> 00:45:29,002
Damn it!

598
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:30,837
What's happening?

599
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:33,298
I don't know
I don't think he's taking it too well

600
00:45:37,344 --> 00:45:40,096
Charlie, listen. The guy is serious
he's not screwing around

601
00:45:40,222 --> 00:45:42,641
He's a psycho, all right?
You gotta do what he says, all right?

602
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:47,604
- Are you there?
- Yes, yes

603
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:49,022
Yeah, listen to this

604
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:51,608
All right, bring the rest
and make sure you're there

605
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:53,193
Remember what I'm telling you now
you got it?

606
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:56,112
- Got it. Before you hang up though...
- What?

607
00:45:56,404 --> 00:45:59,699
If you hurt my friends
you'll never get them

608
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:01,993
Charlie, what are you trying to do?
Are you threatening me?

609
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,291
No, I'm just telling you a fact...
and don't lose my book either

610
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,710
It's my only copy

611
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:12,045
Charlie

612
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,843
All right! All right! All right!
Forget the book, I'll be there

613
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:20,845
Yeah, you better

614
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:24,974
What's happening?

615
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,187
We have to go back to San Diego

616
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:35,109
San Diego? My dad will shit himself!
What are we going to tell him?

617
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:38,571
What to you mean he
forgot to turn in his lap report?

618
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,574
- I know it sounds flaky and...
- Flaky? It's ridiculous!

619
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:44,202
You mean he came all the way
to Mexico without turning in a report

620
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:46,162
and for that we have to go home?

621
00:46:46,245 --> 00:46:47,872
Mom is sick
and anyway it's your fault

622
00:46:47,955 --> 00:46:49,290
My fault?

623
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,459
He took your advice
He's decided on something

624
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:55,254
Well, he's decided that he'll never be
a member of this family, that's for sure

625
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:00,968
- We're leaving
- How did he take it?

626
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,013
It's gonna have to fall under
the category of blessing in disguise

627
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:08,851
I'll make it up to him
I'll give him a year of free analysis

628
00:47:09,143 --> 00:47:11,729
- Cute. Here
- What's this?

629
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:15,816
It's a surprise for his birthday
He likes his macho stuff

630
00:47:17,777 --> 00:47:20,154
Can you pack it in your bag?
I don't want him to see it

631
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:23,365
Where exactly would you suggest I put it?

632
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:26,076
- If we're going, let's get going
- Right, dad

633
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:31,165
The shirt's for you. Get packing

634
00:47:46,555 --> 00:47:49,850
And the macho
statue with all the disgusting...

635
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,772
Laundry

636
00:47:58,484 --> 00:47:59,860
I didn't...

637
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:07,868
Thank you

638
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:44,237
Who's this guy? He might do

639
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:47,616
- Do for what?
- Hugo

640
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:48,992
Wait a minute

641
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:52,537
Are you telling us you're trying to
find a look alike for the head Charlie lost?

642
00:48:52,704 --> 00:48:56,082
Yeah. We got some time to kill
before we go to the airport

643
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:57,584
Oh, my God!

644
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:02,339
But these are college professors!
You know, innocent people!

645
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:06,968
You can't just kill innocent people
because they look like someone else

646
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:09,554
Let me tell you something, college boy
nobody's innocent

647
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,056
Now, who is he?

648
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:15,727
He was my anatomy professor.
He almost flunked me

649
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,772
Good, here's your chance to get even
with the prick. Get me his address

650
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,691
Wait a minute! I just thought of something!

651
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:24,485
- What?
- Cryonics!

652
00:49:24,652 --> 00:49:26,696
- Cry- what?
- Cryonics!

653
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:30,199
Frozen bodies! This university
has the biggest Cryonics Foundation

654
00:49:30,283 --> 00:49:32,243
in the country

655
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:33,620
So what?

656
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:36,414
So it could save you
a lot of troubles is so what!

657
00:49:36,623 --> 00:49:40,418
You go on a killing spree here,
Big Sep's gonna hear about it

658
00:49:40,626 --> 00:49:43,171
When a couple of gangsters die
nobody cares

659
00:49:43,379 --> 00:49:46,549
But you blow away professors
Big Sep's gonna read about that

660
00:49:47,592 --> 00:49:49,135
Big Sep don't read

661
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:54,557
Still, this cryonics facility
has hundreds of frozen bodies

662
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:57,810
Why they got hundreds of frozen bodies?

663
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:01,689
- I think for situations like this
- Don't be a little smart ass

664
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:06,402
They have them because people are hoping
that in a couple hundred years...

665
00:50:06,694 --> 00:50:10,406
...maybe they can bring them back to life,
clone them a healthy body

666
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:12,408
- Are you jerking me around?
- What?

667
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:18,539
Oh, my God, he just put welts and bruises
over 90% of my body, now you're talking...

668
00:50:18,622 --> 00:50:21,709
...about having me help you decapitate some
professors. Would I be jerking you around?

669
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:24,086
Calm down, tough guy.
What are you trying to tell me?

670
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:29,425
I'm trying to tell you that right across campus
is a gold mine of heads

671
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,928
Heads R Us. Night of a Thousand Heads.

672
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:39,226
If I was a guy in desperate need of a head,
as you are, I'd at least check it out

673
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:46,984
Senor, I can't find your jeep anywhere

674
00:50:47,067 --> 00:50:49,903
What do you mean you can't find it?
It's red, rojo

675
00:50:49,945 --> 00:50:53,907
Oh, my God. I forgot.
We, we went for a drive last night

676
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:56,577
and... it got stolen

677
00:50:58,037 --> 00:51:00,164
You forgot it was stolen?

678
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,166
Well, we...

679
00:51:02,249 --> 00:51:04,501
This is ridiculous! How the hell
are we going to get out of here?

680
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:06,628
It's not a problem, senor
take a plane

681
00:51:06,754 --> 00:51:09,131
Oh, a plane! A plane!
And where would we take a plane from?

682
00:51:09,214 --> 00:51:14,052
Here. Since you've been away, senor,
this has become a very important city

683
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:16,638
I mean we have built our own airport

684
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:20,517
- A plane comes every day
- Well, aren't we lucky?

685
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:31,987
Now, that's a Hugo

686
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:37,075
- This one's good?
- For Hugo Porter, unbelievable!

687
00:51:37,284 --> 00:51:39,036
All right, we got a keeper!

688
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:49,254
- What was that?
- Thawing it out

689
00:51:58,388 --> 00:52:00,056
No way

690
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:02,851
Good God! Look at that!

691
00:52:03,226 --> 00:52:05,687
Lassie, sit girl! Stay!

692
00:52:06,479 --> 00:52:08,398
Oh my God!

693
00:52:10,817 --> 00:52:14,112
Oh my God!
Guys! Ernie!

694
00:52:14,195 --> 00:52:16,781
- What?
- I'm not very comfortable, perhaps

695
00:52:16,906 --> 00:52:18,658
Why is that?

696
00:52:19,242 --> 00:52:22,162
We're messing with
people's immortality here. It's murder!

697
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:26,458
Technically, it's not murder, Steve
because they're already dead

698
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:30,336
No, these people,
they believed in the freezing thing

699
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:35,091
All right, this is like grave robbing,
grave robbing, or worse

700
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:39,012
I don't see any graves.
Do you see any graves?

701
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:45,810
There's gonna be two fresh ones, if you
two don't start looking for heads, come on

702
00:52:52,775 --> 00:52:54,068
All right

703
00:52:54,277 --> 00:52:56,988
- Sir, I'm really sorry about the Jeep
- It's open seating

704
00:52:57,113 --> 00:53:00,032
Now you take these tickets
and you check in the big stuff

705
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:02,994
We'll take the little stuff,
and we'll go get the seats

706
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,412
Do you think you can handle that?

707
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:06,330
Yes, I really appreciate you...

708
00:53:06,414 --> 00:53:07,707
Come on, Bear. Come here

709
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:10,710
God!

710
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:14,839
Permiso, senor ,
do you have anything to declare?

711
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:17,508
Any fruits, vegetables, native plants?

712
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:18,843
Are you kidding?

713
00:53:30,896 --> 00:53:32,398
Sobrino! Sobrino!

714
00:53:34,483 --> 00:53:37,236
Mira!
Mira! Que es eso?

715
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:39,029
No se, mira como esta aqui

716
00:53:39,572 --> 00:53:41,699
Excuse me, could you
handle me my bag, please?

717
00:53:41,866 --> 00:53:44,201
- Un momento, senor
- I don't have un momento!

718
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:47,121
I have a plane-o to catch-o, got it?

719
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:51,166
- Machete?
- No, sera una pistola?

720
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:54,920
Excuse me, it's right there, I can see it
I'll just reach in and get it myself, okay?

721
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,881
Senor... no. No, Senor!

722
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:08,976
What? Is it dad?

723
00:54:11,854 --> 00:54:13,480
What?

724
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:17,109
They found two heads in Dad's carry-on

725
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:19,570
Oh, no!

726
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:24,908
Put me down! Put me down!

727
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:26,493
Oh, my God!

728
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,537
Help me! Help me!

729
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,626
Oh, my God!

730
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:47,139
- Decent, hold this one
- Yeah, wait. Do you need a Helen?

731
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:49,891
No, you can play with her when I leave
Get over there

732
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:59,442
- This guy do anything for you?
- He's not bad either

733
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,444
Could be a Stu

734
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:03,154
- Yeah?
- Yeah

735
00:55:03,238 --> 00:55:05,615
We could beat him a little bit
give him a few cuts

736
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:07,659
Random disfigurement

737
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:10,620
Yeah, definitely a Stu

738
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:13,832
Worth a try anyway.
I'll take him and I'll take him

739
00:55:13,915 --> 00:55:17,585
- Great, I'll wrap them up
- What do you mean take? Huh?

740
00:55:19,504 --> 00:55:24,759
You know, for a future doctor
you're a pretty stupid kid

741
00:55:25,552 --> 00:55:28,054
I mean take the heads

742
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:34,018
No, No

743
00:55:34,102 --> 00:55:39,232
No, no way! You do it!
This is your crazy idea, okay?

744
00:55:39,357 --> 00:55:42,318
It's my idea that you should do it

745
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:45,321
But, he's a neurologist,
I'm only going into dermatology

746
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:48,616
So don't screw up the skin

747
00:56:03,423 --> 00:56:05,466
Now there's a pleasant sound

748
00:56:11,097 --> 00:56:15,601
Mr. Escobedo, this is my mother,
Annette, Charlie and Fran Bennett

749
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:18,437
Dad's mom. She flew down to help us out

750
00:56:18,688 --> 00:56:20,982
Nona, this is Dad's Mexican lawyer

751
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:23,401
- Delighted
- Charmed

752
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:25,987
Now, cut the crap and
tell us what the hell's going on!

753
00:56:26,112 --> 00:56:27,530
Certainly

754
00:56:30,741 --> 00:56:32,993
Miamigos, in your country

755
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,871
you have what you call
the good news and the bad news

756
00:56:36,205 --> 00:56:40,626
The good news is that Mr. Bennet
underwent only very mild torture

757
00:56:40,709 --> 00:56:43,587
- Jesus!
- Oh my God!

758
00:56:43,712 --> 00:56:47,216
Shut up, you poodle. What's the bad news?

759
00:56:47,424 --> 00:56:49,385
He confessed and was sentenced to death

760
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:53,222
- Oh my God!
- That little weakling!

761
00:56:56,183 --> 00:56:57,601
Oh, Mom!

762
00:56:57,643 --> 00:57:01,021
- Wait a minute. Don't get upset yet
- Not get upset?

763
00:57:01,146 --> 00:57:02,815
Let the man speak, damn it!

764
00:57:02,982 --> 00:57:05,693
There are remedies here.
This is a civilized country

765
00:57:05,776 --> 00:57:08,696
There's going to be a trial
some sort of hearing

766
00:57:08,779 --> 00:57:11,824
Of course. When my partner arrives,
we will formulate our strategy

767
00:57:12,116 --> 00:57:13,951
Until then, try to relax

768
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:16,662
It's a beautiful day. Enjoy Mexico

769
00:57:17,371 --> 00:57:18,747
I can't belive it

770
00:57:18,997 --> 00:57:21,250
Things get a little rough and he cracks

771
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:23,794
- Nona, they tortured him
- Oh, what?

772
00:57:23,919 --> 00:57:25,629
A little castor oil down his gullet?

773
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:28,841
A little electricity on his dillywacker?

774
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:31,718
Cat piss!

775
00:57:43,939 --> 00:57:45,774
I am spent!

776
00:57:47,859 --> 00:57:50,570
Chopping off heads just takes it out of you

777
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:56,034
Shit!

778
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:58,620
Time to go, I got four heads
I'm screwed

779
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:00,872
But you got a good start

780
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:04,334
I'm sure one of those heads
in there will do for the one Charlie lost

781
00:58:04,543 --> 00:58:07,087
I doubt it, the way
my luck's running today, kid

782
00:58:08,004 --> 00:58:12,384
Let's take a second and
take stock of where we are so far

783
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,636
Let me tell you something, kid, okay?

784
00:58:14,803 --> 00:58:17,847
Just so you know,
I gotta kill the both of you

785
00:58:17,973 --> 00:58:21,142
So don't think by helping me
it's gonna change that, all right?

786
00:58:21,226 --> 00:58:25,063
Yeah, I know, sure, I'm just
saying that you're doing all right

787
00:58:25,146 --> 00:58:26,815
you might be better off than you think

788
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,776
Okay, but I'm just saying too
I want you to know

789
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:36,616
Okay, let's see. I got a Hugo, a Marty,
a so-so Stu, and a bad Frank

790
00:58:37,575 --> 00:58:40,578
Right, and then at the morgue,
you said something about Little Joey

791
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:42,121
- Right
- Okay

792
00:58:42,247 --> 00:58:45,583
All right, so I got Little Joey,
a Hugo, a Marty, and a bad Frank

793
00:58:46,668 --> 00:58:49,629
- No, where's Stu?
- I said Stu, so-so Stu

794
00:58:49,712 --> 00:58:51,673
No, just a second ago, you said Little Joey

795
00:58:51,714 --> 00:58:54,509
I know I said little Joey
but I also said Stu

796
00:58:54,592 --> 00:58:55,885
But then where's Frank?

797
00:58:57,428 --> 00:59:01,474
All right, let's start over
You got a Hugo... a Little Joey...

798
00:59:01,808 --> 00:59:03,476
- ... a Frank...
- Yeah

799
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:07,438
- A bad Stu...
- No... Frank... bad Frank

800
00:59:07,897 --> 00:59:09,148
That's what I said

801
00:59:09,524 --> 00:59:11,526
No, you didn't, you said bad Stu,
Stu was just so-so

802
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:15,112
No, sir, I said a so-so Stu
You did not. You said bad Stu

803
00:59:15,196 --> 00:59:17,031
Yes, I said. Everyone heard

804
00:59:17,114 --> 00:59:18,366
I said so-so Stu

805
00:59:18,616 --> 00:59:21,327
You said bad Stu!
I know their names and you don't

806
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:24,705
Will you two stop it! Goddamnit!

807
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:30,503
These are not baseball cards
we're talking about here, all right?

808
00:59:30,962 --> 00:59:33,839
These are heads, human beings' heads

809
00:59:38,302 --> 00:59:39,762
Where were we?

810
00:59:40,054 --> 00:59:43,641
- I said we have a Hugo
- Yes

811
00:59:43,682 --> 00:59:46,352
Ho, ho, wait a minute, just a sec.

812
00:59:49,271 --> 00:59:51,315
I can't believe I didn't notice this before

813
00:59:51,398 --> 00:59:52,691
What?

814
00:59:52,817 --> 00:59:55,903
With some black hair and a busted
nose, this kid makes a decent Frank

815
00:59:56,028 --> 00:59:57,988
- What?
- Yeah

816
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:02,493
I mean I know you're a little young,
but with that stubble

817
01:00:02,576 --> 01:00:04,954
- a couple of missing teeth
- But you have a Frank

818
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,830
I got a bad Frank,
you make a better one

819
01:00:06,956 --> 01:00:09,208
But you don't even know
if you need a Frank!

820
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,835
- I might
- Please no, please, no

821
01:00:11,919 --> 01:00:14,630
Listen, please, no, listen
I don't want any trouble

822
01:00:14,713 --> 01:00:16,298
Look, I fly, I fly

823
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:19,968
- What are you? A fairy?
- No, no, he has a pilot's license

824
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:23,889
You don't wanna fly commercial
airlines with all these heads

825
01:00:24,014 --> 01:00:27,726
That's how you got in this whole mess.
He can fly us. It's smarter

826
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,228
I fly

827
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,189
All right, grab all those heads.
Just leave the top one

828
01:00:32,314 --> 01:00:33,565
Why?

829
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:37,778
Because the top one doesn't look like
anybody and Big Sep will never buy it

830
01:00:37,945 --> 01:00:44,201
Wait just a minute! I sawed this off
and you re not even gonna use it?

831
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:46,244
- Steve, chill
- No, you chill

832
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:50,999
It s not fair. I spent a lot of time on this head

833
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:55,045
Don't you think that you could've at
least told me this before I cut it off?

834
01:00:55,295 --> 01:00:57,547
I saw that coming

835
01:00:58,048 --> 01:01:01,301
- Don't fuck with a guy looking for heads
- Good advice

836
01:01:02,052 --> 01:01:05,013
Now take all the heads and let's go, okay?

837
01:01:06,473 --> 01:01:10,352
- Big Sep, it's Benny
- Where the hell are my heads?

838
01:01:10,602 --> 01:01:13,396
I just talked to Tommy a while ago.
He'll be there tomorrow

839
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:17,943
First it was two weeks ago,
then three days ago

840
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:20,153
I gave them to Tommy.
It's Tommy's deal now

841
01:01:20,236 --> 01:01:22,364
Don't you talk to me about Tommy.
I trust Tommy

842
01:01:23,323 --> 01:01:24,908
This is your job

843
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:26,493
Big Sep, what are we talking about here

844
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:30,372
Heads! It's not like they got any
value on the open market

845
01:01:30,497 --> 01:01:31,748
It's not like we re talking diamonds here

846
01:01:31,915 --> 01:01:33,750
now that's what's bothering me Ben

847
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,420
A guy pays 80 grand
and doesn't see proof ...

848
01:01:37,629 --> 01:01:44,260
He starts thinking maybe, just maybe he's
been double-crossed, you know what I mean?

849
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:50,725
Big Sep, I swear on the soul of my dead
mother, I off them myself

850
01:01:50,934 --> 01:01:53,770
me, and Rico, I give you my word!

851
01:01:53,853 --> 01:01:56,814
Your word ain't what
I paid you 80 fucking grand for, Ben

852
01:01:57,482 --> 01:02:01,611
I paid you 80 fucking grand
to see their fucking heads

853
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:05,657
Now you bring me their heads

854
01:02:08,242 --> 01:02:11,329
Bennie! Bennie, Bennie,
come in here, hurry up!

855
01:02:13,372 --> 01:02:15,249
Bennie, you re not gonna believe
this! look, look at this!

856
01:02:17,627 --> 01:02:19,962
- My God! That's Hugo!
- That s Hugo and Stu, I mean...

857
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:22,006
didn't I tell you he'd screw up,
Bennie, didn't I tell you?

858
01:02:22,215 --> 01:02:24,967
- This ain' t good
- What the hell's Big Sep gonna say, Bennie

859
01:02:25,384 --> 01:02:26,844
Shut up!

860
01:02:32,266 --> 01:02:34,810
Ernie Lipscomb,
Please pick up a courtesy phone

861
01:02:42,068 --> 01:02:43,486
This is Ernie Lipscomb

862
01:02:43,611 --> 01:02:46,489
Ernie, it's Charlie. Let me talk to him

863
01:02:47,823 --> 01:02:52,912
- Sure. It's for you
- Yeah?

864
01:02:53,412 --> 01:02:57,041
Hi, it s Charlie, l...
I lost two more heads

865
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,793
What? how could you
lose two more heads?

866
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:03,839
- The police got them
- How could the police get them?

867
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:07,885
The one I lost earlier,
I got it back

868
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,015
What are you looking at?

869
01:03:16,268 --> 01:03:18,520
He's talking about potheads

870
01:03:19,104 --> 01:03:22,399
We re de-programmers
with marijuana anonymous

871
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:24,735
He hates to lose a client

872
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:30,532
Listen to me, you little incompetent
piece of shit! Where are you exactly?

873
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,493
The La Purisima Hotel

874
01:03:32,659 --> 01:03:36,497
Don't move. Don't leave your room
for anything. I coming down there

875
01:03:36,705 --> 01:03:39,249
If there s any more heads
missing by the time I get there

876
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:41,960
I'm gonna replace them with your
family and your friends, you hear me, huh?

877
01:03:46,715 --> 01:03:49,760
He really cares, and
that's what makes him the best

878
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,972
What?

879
01:03:56,683 --> 01:03:59,936
I'm thinking that once he gets
these away from us your dad's a goner

880
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:01,897
We gotta move

881
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:06,318
I, I saw a place just outside of here, we gotta
check into another hotel, come on, get up!

882
01:04:07,694 --> 01:04:11,239
Uhm, I'll take these
I had nowhere else to put them

883
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,367
I'll take these to the
American border, I'll give them to the police

884
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:16,203
I'll rent a car
I'll drive all night

885
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:17,579
- What am I gonna tell my mother?
- Tell her anything

886
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,999
Tell her we had a fight,
tell her I called you fat

887
01:04:21,082 --> 01:04:23,960
It doesn't matter what she thinks
the important thing is to save your dad

888
01:04:24,586 --> 01:04:26,421
I'm not fat

889
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:29,633
Look Laurie, maybe your dad
was right about me

890
01:04:29,758 --> 01:04:32,552
Maybe, I'm a total nimrod
who can't follow through on anything

891
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:34,804
But I got him into this

892
01:04:34,929 --> 01:04:38,433
I promise you, I'm gonna get him out

893
01:04:42,937 --> 01:04:44,856
Get your hands off her Maniac!

894
01:04:44,939 --> 01:04:46,274
Hold on!

895
01:04:46,399 --> 01:04:49,152
You may want me to think I'm crazy
but I'm not crazy and I'm not stupid

896
01:04:49,277 --> 01:04:53,031
you had those heads hidden in your room,
and then you pinned them on my Dick

897
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:54,407
Mom, what are you saying?

898
01:04:54,532 --> 01:04:57,410
I'm calling the police on him,
I'm gonna do it right now

899
01:04:58,244 --> 01:04:59,495
- No
- No

900
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:04,334
Mom, calling the police
is a bad idea. No, no

901
01:05:04,459 --> 01:05:09,422
Laurie, I love you. Take your hand off the phone
you, back off, I know exactly what I am doing

902
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,965
No, you, you're not thinking clearly

903
01:05:11,049 --> 01:05:14,969
I am thinking perfectly. I know exactly
what I am doing. I told you to back off!

904
01:05:15,053 --> 01:05:18,639
Operator? No, I wasn't yelling at you.
Could you get me the police please?

905
01:05:20,266 --> 01:05:24,270
Oh yes, operator, I need you
to get the police for me, policia?

906
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:31,277
Si, si, si, I'm trying to reach
the police, the policia, si, gracias...

907
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,115
Yes, Si, Si!

908
01:05:36,407 --> 01:05:38,034
Yes, of course, I'll hold,
I'm happy to hold

909
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:40,494
For Christ s sake, keep it down!

910
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:45,082
Yes, oh, hello, police, yes, I have...

911
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:53,174
Charlie, hurry! Go!

912
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:03,517
- I need to rent a car
- Sure, that's no problem

913
01:06:04,477 --> 01:06:09,273
We got chevys,
jeep, chevys...

914
01:06:09,773 --> 01:06:12,776
Hey, that looks like our jeep

915
01:06:14,945 --> 01:06:18,532
Well, uh, there's a lot
of jeeps, you know, senor

916
01:06:18,616 --> 01:06:22,286
With this magazine in them? I don't
think so. This jeep was stolen from us

917
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,539
I don't know, senor
a lot of people read magazines

918
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:28,417
On seizures? You gotta be kidding me!

919
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,671
You really like that magazine, huh?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

920
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:37,551
You rent this jeep,
I'm gonna throw in magazine for Nada

921
01:06:43,974 --> 01:06:45,517
Unbelievable!

922
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:09,040
Excuse me.
where can we rent a car? Thanks!

923
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:11,877
All right, make sure it has A.C
Hold on, champ. Thanks

924
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:16,548
Are you telling me I just passed out?

925
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:18,967
Come on, drink up, you're a little dehydrated

926
01:07:20,677 --> 01:07:23,889
- I'm gonna get us packed
- My butt's staying right here

927
01:07:24,055 --> 01:07:26,224
Why? I hear
the Tropicana s wonderful

928
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:31,771
It's a waste of money, honey! Give me
the two c's, a cot and a crapper, I'm set

929
01:07:31,855 --> 01:07:33,148
But...

930
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:35,442
Laurie, Charlie, it's Ernie

931
01:07:35,525 --> 01:07:37,235
- Jesus!
- Who the hell is Ernie?

932
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,779
- Nobody, grandma
- Well, he sure as hell seems to know you

933
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:42,449
- No, grandma
- Is this some guy you're boffing on the side?

934
01:07:42,574 --> 01:07:44,993
- Grandma!
- What the hell are you doing?

935
01:07:46,995 --> 01:07:48,997
- Where's Charlie?
- Who are you?

936
01:07:49,372 --> 01:07:52,167
I asked you a question
where the fuck is Charlie?

937
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:55,044
And I asked you a question,
who the fuck are you?

938
01:07:58,715 --> 01:08:01,342
Now that we're in this frigging
La Purisima, what do we do now?

939
01:08:01,467 --> 01:08:05,179
We find a cop station and we get our heads

940
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:06,723
All right

941
01:08:07,056 --> 01:08:08,975
Benny! Look! It's him! It's Tommy!

942
01:08:11,185 --> 01:08:14,439
What the hell do you think he's doing?
Do you think he got the heads back already?

943
01:08:14,605 --> 01:08:17,400
I don't know, but why
don't we follow him? Come no!

944
01:08:35,585 --> 01:08:37,128
Where the hell is he going?

945
01:08:38,212 --> 01:08:39,589
Keep following him

946
01:08:40,256 --> 01:08:42,008
I told Charlie to stay put

947
01:08:42,341 --> 01:08:44,719
I told that son-of-bitch to stay put

948
01:08:44,885 --> 01:08:47,513
So who are you? God?
Why the hell should he listen to you?

949
01:08:48,472 --> 01:08:52,893
Oh! I am so groggy!
Do you mind if I lie down in the back?

950
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:56,022
I don't give a shit what
you do lady, just keep quiet

951
01:08:56,105 --> 01:08:57,523
Watch your language

952
01:08:58,566 --> 01:09:00,609
Ow! Fern, stop it! Ugh!

953
01:09:11,704 --> 01:09:13,289
Oh! My God!

954
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:19,128
Another head? Oh! My God!

955
01:09:21,338 --> 01:09:23,632
Lady, lady, shut up!

956
01:09:25,134 --> 01:09:30,222
I can't stand it! I'm losing my mind!
Everywhere I look are heads!

957
01:09:30,472 --> 01:09:32,599
Shut up, lady! Jesus Christ!

958
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:35,394
You're not the only person
on this planet with problems

959
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:37,146
Shut it!

960
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:38,856
Jesus! What a head case!

961
01:09:39,148 --> 01:09:42,317
Is that supposed to be a joke? Killer humour!

962
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,363
looks like this guy
I dated in High School

963
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,657
Hugo Porto

964
01:09:55,622 --> 01:09:58,584
Hey, I think we're gonna pull over
because we need some gas soon

965
01:09:58,667 --> 01:10:02,629
- Keep fucking driving
- Didn't I tell you to watch your language?

966
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:06,800
What are you doing? Where are you going?

967
01:10:07,843 --> 01:10:11,346
Get your hands off me, you goon!
Don't fuck with me!

968
01:10:12,472 --> 01:10:14,057
Grandma!

969
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:24,109
- My money says he ain't got the head
- Mine, too

970
01:10:24,609 --> 01:10:26,695
Man, how could you do that?

971
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:29,155
- How could I what?
- Throw her off the cliff?

972
01:10:30,156 --> 01:10:32,033
A man can only take so much, Kid

973
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:37,831
Oh! My God! I can't believe it!

974
01:10:38,832 --> 01:10:40,458
I can't believe he...

975
01:10:41,793 --> 01:10:45,380
- I thought the old battle-ax would never die!
- Mom!

976
01:11:06,276 --> 01:11:07,610
What do you wanna do now?

977
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:10,905
Keep following him,
but I don't like the smell of this

978
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:27,422
- Well, well, well, if it isn't our old amingo
- Oh! No! not again!

979
01:11:29,382 --> 01:11:32,301
Isn't once enough, huh?
Can't you give a guy a break?

980
01:11:32,718 --> 01:11:34,387
From one human being to another

981
01:11:34,846 --> 01:11:36,556
That's, that's very moving, gringo

982
01:11:37,348 --> 01:11:42,061
But the real question is, are we gonna
cut off your conjones? Or live them on?

983
01:11:43,271 --> 01:11:46,148
You don't have to do this, come on guys,
you can't kill me, can't we flip for it

984
01:11:46,274 --> 01:11:48,109
You think you should kill me, flip for it?

985
01:11:48,693 --> 01:11:50,820
- What?
- A coin, you know?

986
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:54,615
Flip a coin, I win you let me go,
you win you mangle me

987
01:12:02,248 --> 01:12:03,666
you're a crazy man, gringo

988
01:12:10,923 --> 01:12:12,424
- Call it
- Heads

989
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:15,845
Oh, you sure? you don't even wanna
you sure you don't wanna think about it?

990
01:12:15,928 --> 01:12:18,305
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life

991
01:12:49,086 --> 01:12:52,214
Juan! Don't take the keys!
Don't take the keys!

992
01:12:54,007 --> 01:12:55,384
Oh, God!

993
01:13:01,306 --> 01:13:03,809
Oh, this has not been a very good vacation

994
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:12,943
Hello? Hello!

995
01:13:18,323 --> 01:13:19,616
Who's there?

996
01:13:23,787 --> 01:13:25,956
Stop! Stop!

997
01:13:33,255 --> 01:13:35,715
- Not your kind of music
- I hate that shit

998
01:13:38,218 --> 01:13:44,849
Are you talking to me?

999
01:13:48,853 --> 01:13:51,356
I said, are you talking to me?

1000
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:56,986
I don't know who you're talking to

1001
01:13:57,112 --> 01:14:01,324
- I'm the only one here
- Shut the fuck up!

1002
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:05,286
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, I'm talking to you, shut up!

1003
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:09,749
Shut up... Screwball!

1004
01:14:13,419 --> 01:14:15,255
- What's that?
- What's what?

1005
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:16,673
Stop! stop!

1006
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:18,758
Oh! No!

1007
01:14:22,011 --> 01:14:24,222
Whoa, hold on now!
Hold on, hold on, just okay, okay

1008
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,682
Hey, come here, stop

1009
01:14:26,474 --> 01:14:28,518
okay, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1010
01:14:36,526 --> 01:14:37,985
I thought I told you to stay put?

1011
01:14:38,152 --> 01:14:40,696
Where's my heads? Where's my heads?

1012
01:14:40,822 --> 01:14:42,615
They're in the jeep
They're in the coolers

1013
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:45,535
- Good
- But I lost another one

1014
01:14:45,618 --> 01:14:46,911
What?

1015
01:14:47,411 --> 01:14:50,456
Here, coyote

1016
01:14:50,873 --> 01:14:54,001
- What's he doing?
- The kid ain't dead, that's for sure

1017
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:57,380
Here coyote!

1018
01:15:03,427 --> 01:15:05,888
- Shut!
- What?

1019
01:15:06,097 --> 01:15:07,556
- Shut up!
- What? What is it?

1020
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:10,059
I'm dead, shit, I'm dead

1021
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:12,019
Who, uh, whoever they are, it
doesn't look like they're coming after us

1022
01:15:12,353 --> 01:15:15,898
Not yet. Just the fact that
they're here means I'm dead though

1023
01:15:16,774 --> 01:15:18,359
When? As soon as I give you the heads?

1024
01:15:18,859 --> 01:15:20,945
Or as soon as I get them across to the States

1025
01:15:21,946 --> 01:15:24,114
Knowing them,
they're gonna let me take that risk too

1026
01:15:25,908 --> 01:15:27,368
Who are the heads anyway?

1027
01:15:27,493 --> 01:15:30,496
What? Non of your business
What the hell do you care?

1028
01:15:31,622 --> 01:15:34,375
You spend your vacation with a bunch
of heads, you kind of want to know

1029
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:38,045
You think about their hopes and their dreams

1030
01:15:39,046 --> 01:15:41,090
Their lives cut short

1031
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,718
Hopes? Dreams? Those bums?

1032
01:15:45,135 --> 01:15:46,720
You have to feel something!

1033
01:15:46,845 --> 01:15:49,014
You don't just kill eight
people and not feel anything!

1034
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:54,561
It don't really matter, but let's
just set the record straight, okay?

1035
01:15:54,937 --> 01:15:57,648
First of all, I didn't
whack them, those guys did

1036
01:15:57,773 --> 01:16:00,150
Second, Mister Phi Beta Craphead

1037
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:03,195
If I hadn't fucked up,
I'd be retiring after this

1038
01:16:05,697 --> 01:16:07,366
Hey! Hey! look! look!

1039
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:13,622
What is he doing? It looks like
he's chasing after a dog?

1040
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:19,378
- What if we could help each other out here?
- Impossible

1041
01:16:19,503 --> 01:16:20,796
Why?

1042
01:16:20,879 --> 01:16:24,800
Because you're stupid besides I'm not gonna
take the chance of going across that border

1043
01:16:25,592 --> 01:16:28,428
Well, if you know it all then how come
you're in this mess to begin with?

1044
01:16:28,929 --> 01:16:30,347
Because of bad luck

1045
01:16:30,597 --> 01:16:33,266
It's not my fault that the bag
was to big to go in carry-on

1046
01:16:33,433 --> 01:16:36,061
There was a gift shop right next to the gate

1047
01:16:36,228 --> 01:16:38,271
Didn't you ever think of taking two bags?

1048
01:16:39,523 --> 01:16:41,274
Oh! Shit!

1049
01:16:45,237 --> 01:16:49,658
So I'll repeat the question, what if there's
where a way we could help each other out?

1050
01:16:50,825 --> 01:16:52,452
What way?

1051
01:17:04,714 --> 01:17:07,342
I'm not into mass murder
if I'm not getting paid for it

1052
01:17:07,717 --> 01:17:10,845
But I'm warning you,
anybody gets in my way is dead

1053
01:17:11,638 --> 01:17:14,766
- Thank you again for getting rid of fern
- Mom!

1054
01:17:14,974 --> 01:17:18,478
The going rate five thousand
dollars, but you can owe me lady

1055
01:17:27,946 --> 01:17:29,530
Where's he going?

1056
01:17:29,781 --> 01:17:32,492
I don't know,
Do I look a mind reader? Let's go, come on

1057
01:17:34,243 --> 01:17:36,412
So now what do we do?
Drive to the border?

1058
01:17:36,537 --> 01:17:39,290
Hello no! We gotta get those
heads back and save your dad

1059
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:44,754
Hey! Come back here! I'll kick your ass!

1060
01:18:12,281 --> 01:18:16,535
- Come on Bennie let's take him now
- I expect that's exactly what he wants

1061
01:18:18,579 --> 01:18:20,706
Uh, let's see, how lucky

1062
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,376

01:18:28,589 --> 01:18:30,466
Ah, we got Benito

1064
01:18:35,221 --> 01:18:37,348
Little Joey

1065
01:18:38,557 --> 01:18:40,309
What is he doing?

1066
01:18:40,351 --> 01:18:43,187
I don't know, it s like he's teasing us
wait a minute it's caught on my neck!

1067
01:18:46,815 --> 01:18:48,609
Ouch, Jamal, you wanna bite, huh?

1068
01:18:50,361 --> 01:18:51,779
Jamal! Jamal!

1069
01:18:52,446 --> 01:18:54,281
Let's see, what do I need?

1070
01:18:54,823 --> 01:18:58,077
I need a Stu,
a Frank and a Hugo

1071
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,251
There's a Hugo

1072
01:19:06,335 --> 01:19:08,212
- Who is it?
- It looks like Stu or Hugo

1073
01:19:09,671 --> 01:19:15,761
Frankie you suck...
but you're gonna have to do, buddy

1074
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:17,763
How many has he got now?

1075
01:19:17,846 --> 01:19:21,058
He's got one, two seven, eight .

1076
01:19:21,224 --> 01:19:23,393
- He's got all eight heads
- I'm gonna make him the ninth head

1077
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:27,689
And you, you I definitely don't need

1078
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,693
what a bunch of douchebags!

1079
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:38,408
Lost dreams! What a crock!

1080
01:19:42,454 --> 01:19:47,792
This coyote won't
be doing anymore running away

1081
01:20:08,688 --> 01:20:10,356
I got him trained!

1082
01:20:10,523 --> 01:20:12,567
That is disgusting
I can't leave it outside for the coyotes

1083
01:20:14,694 --> 01:20:17,238
Everybody be still,
this is our last match

1084
01:20:22,577 --> 01:20:24,412
Good work Steve, you asshole!

1085
01:20:25,663 --> 01:20:28,249
That's it,
we're just gonna have to wait till dawn

1086
01:20:36,716 --> 01:20:38,009
Steve, shut up!

1087
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:43,222
Heads up!
Stop ahead!

1088
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:45,224
Anybody need to use the head!

1089
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:50,104
Steve, shut up and go to sleep

1090
01:20:50,396 --> 01:20:54,734
Oh, don't let it go to your head
whoa, whoa, whoa, you're way ahead of me

1091
01:20:54,775 --> 01:20:56,235
Steve!

1092
01:20:57,069 --> 01:20:59,197
Hey, don't bite my head off, all right?

1093
01:21:00,406 --> 01:21:03,242
- That's it, I m sleeping outside guys
- Me too

1094
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:07,163
Steve! Get a grip, go to sleep

1095
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:10,249
Or what, huh? You'll have my head?

1096
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:14,211
Enough!

1097
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:44,158
Mr. Hitman

1098
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:46,118
I'm so alone

1099
01:21:46,744 --> 01:21:50,372
Ain't got no body to call my own

1100
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:54,001
Ain't got no legs for walking all over

1101
01:21:54,293 --> 01:21:57,963
Can't hold my liquor
so I gotta stay sober

1102
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:01,467
Mr. hitman, give me a break

1103
01:22:01,759 --> 01:22:05,137
Tell Mr. Pizza that I ain't no steak

1104
01:22:05,512 --> 01:22:08,432
Please put on your magic sheen

1105
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,268
Mr. Hitman bring me a dream

1106
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:24,656
Jesus!

1107
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:37,002
- Bennie! Wake up! He's up! He's up!
- I'm up! I'm up! Relax!

1108
01:22:39,129 --> 01:22:42,299
Damn it! This always works on the Camaro

1109
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:45,802
- You can do it
- I Know. All right!

1110
01:23:18,668 --> 01:23:20,086
Can I get some breakfast here?

1111
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:22,547
Si, Senior, please, sit anywhere you like

1112
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:28,720
- Bennie, what the hell is he doing?
- I don't know, let's go find out, shall we?

1113
01:23:29,888 --> 01:23:32,223
- Coffee, Senor?
- Uh, yeah, good

1114
01:23:32,724 --> 01:23:34,350
- Juice?
- Sure

1115
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,369
Wow, look at this surprise!

1116
01:23:53,619 --> 01:23:56,873
Bennie, Rico, you boys decide
to take a vacation?

1117
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:00,209
Yeah, Tommy, you know
we never seen Mexico

1118
01:24:00,418 --> 01:24:02,795
We figured this is a good time to check it out

1119
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,964
Good, good... it's nice down here

1120
01:24:05,756 --> 01:24:08,885
l know you re waiting for me
to cross over to the States

1121
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:11,512
But I gotta tell you now, when I do

1122
01:24:11,721 --> 01:24:14,974
You'll get that bag
over my dead body

1123
01:24:15,808 --> 01:24:19,478
Funny. We was thinking
exact same thing, huh, Rico?

1124
01:24:25,651 --> 01:24:26,944
That's his Van

1125
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:32,742
The guy with the van, where is he?

1126
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,368
Uh, he's in the hotel, Senior

1127
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:36,704
You're not going in there
after him , are you?

1128
01:24:36,787 --> 01:24:38,914
We need those heads, yes,
I'm going in there

1129
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:42,459
l can't believe you're actually doing this

1130
01:25:03,814 --> 01:25:05,107
Give me your guns

1131
01:25:05,858 --> 01:25:07,651
Jesus! Charlie, where'd you get that?

1132
01:25:07,776 --> 01:25:09,820
- It looks like mine
- It was yours

1133
01:25:09,945 --> 01:25:11,989
You dropped it in the dessert,
now it's mine

1134
01:25:12,114 --> 01:25:14,032
now both of you, put your guns on the table

1135
01:25:14,199 --> 01:25:15,993
Or I'm gonna blow your heads off

1136
01:25:18,036 --> 01:25:19,454
Right now!

1137
01:25:24,626 --> 01:25:26,461
Laurie, get the guns

1138
01:25:29,881 --> 01:25:31,341
Ernie, get the duffel bag

1139

- Wait a minute!
- Easy, kids

1140
01:25:32,968 --> 01:25:34,261
You don't wanna mess with these guys

1141
01:25:34,386 --> 01:25:37,055
He's right, Charlie, what do you
want those heads for anyway?

1142
01:25:37,139 --> 01:25:39,725
He's gonna take them to the border,
and turn in, right, Charlie?

1143
01:25:40,225 --> 01:25:43,061
- You'll be a hero with her old man
- Something like that

1144
01:25:43,145 --> 01:25:47,441
Forget about it, you do that
and Big Sep kills us all

1145
01:25:48,733 --> 01:25:50,152
Fuck Big Sep!

1146
01:25:54,156 --> 01:25:57,868
- Mrs. Bennett, Senor Prit-Shit
- Paco

1147
01:26:02,455 --> 01:26:06,001
We're F.B.l!
He's the Unibell man

1148
01:26:09,796 --> 01:26:11,131
Senora Bennett?

1149
01:26:15,218 --> 01:26:16,636
Back off

1150
01:26:25,979 --> 01:26:27,272
Come on, Laurie, drive faster

1151
01:26:27,355 --> 01:26:30,108
What have you done?
Laurie, why do you have guns?

1152
01:26:30,275 --> 01:26:31,568
What... what...

1153
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,903
Senor Pritchit, senor Bennett,
what's happening? What's this all about?

1154
01:26:34,028 --> 01:26:35,363
It's about heads

1155
01:26:35,488 --> 01:26:37,907
- Steve, leave him alone
- Why does she have guns?

1156
01:26:38,032 --> 01:26:42,954
Look! See? Heads ! All right?

1157
01:26:43,371 --> 01:26:45,623
I know, but it's okay, Paco, Paco

1158
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:49,544
I told you it wasn't recyclable

1159
01:26:50,545 --> 01:26:52,672
Paco, it's okay, Paco

1160
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,516
Charlie, what are we gonna do? Charlie?

1161
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:06,477
- What are you doing?
- Ernie, give me the duffel bag

1162
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:10,189
Everybody stay in the car!

1163
01:27:10,815 --> 01:27:12,149
Steve, stay in the car!

1164
01:27:14,443 --> 01:27:16,404
Move, please! Move!

1165
01:27:22,285 --> 01:27:24,495
Hola! Hola!

1166
01:27:27,164 --> 01:27:28,457
I have something to declare!

1167
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:32,044
His mistake, he doesn't have anything

1168
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:33,629
Arrest them! Arrest them!

1169
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,382
That's his bag! Arrest them

1170
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:41,637
All right, everybody freeze!

1171
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,431
Don't do anything stupid
and nothing stupid will happen

1172
01:27:44,682 --> 01:27:46,433
- Get to the plane, Rico
- Oh! Shit!

1173
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:52,523
No need to be excited!

1174
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:54,692
Charlie!

1175
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:58,445
We're just getting in the plane and
fly away, bye-bye, have a nice day

1176
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:01,365
Arrest them!

1177
01:28:01,532 --> 01:28:02,866
Drop your guns or I'm gonna shoot him

1178
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:04,868
- Move in, goddamnit!
- No!

1179
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:07,746
Charlie! No!

1180
01:28:09,331 --> 01:28:12,376
Arrest them!
Check their bag! Open their bag!

1181
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:15,087
There's a human head in the bag!

1182
01:28:21,844 --> 01:28:23,428
The man you arrested
yesterday is in jail

1183
01:28:23,512 --> 01:28:25,138
for the murders these guys committed

1184
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:26,807
He father is innocent

1185
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:29,017
These are the guys who did it

1186
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:32,145
Right there!

1187
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:35,440
Wait a minute!
That's not ours!

1188
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:38,193
- You arrested us for the wrong head!
- Rico

1189
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,820
- Our heads are not here!
- Shut up!

1190
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:42,197
- Where are our heads, asshole?
- Shut up, Rico

1191
01:28:44,991 --> 01:28:46,284
Al suelo!

1192
01:29:00,757 --> 01:29:02,926
You knew it? You planned it?

1193
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:21,528
- You got a future, kid!
- Thanks

1194

"Slight of Bag by Charlie Pritchett"

1195
01:29:52,141 --> 01:29:54,394
Show me the law about
bringing a head out of the country

1196
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:58,272
It ain't a fruit, it ain't a vegetable
it ain't a native plant, goddamnit!

1197
01:30:08,908 --> 01:30:10,326
Alto! Alto!

1198
01:30:11,244 --> 01:30:13,246
You can't have it!
It's mine!

1199
01:30:13,538 --> 01:30:17,291
I spent a lot of time on this head
It's my best friend!
