00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,617
We gotta get the hell
out of here.

Yes.

You're the boss.
Come on.

That's Hugo porto's mob, huh?

14
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:46,961
Yeah. They tried to move in
on big sep's territory

15
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:48,595
down in Atlantic city.

16
00:01:48,597 --> 00:01:50,897
Killed Victor viking's mom
in the process.

17
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,765
Wow! What a bunch
of scumbags, huh?

18
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:54,299
Whatever.

19
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,433

Okay.

23
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:01,704
Hey, Tommy,

24
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,172
big sep's hot.

25
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:05,374
I'm two weeks late
delivering the meat.

If he doesn't get that
by noon tomorrow,

more heads are gonna roll,
you know what I mean?

over here, please?

66
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:34,974
Got to check your pockets...

67
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:36,608
Got a gun!
She got a gun?

68
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,176
Get it away from her!

I don't own a gun!

stop struggling.
Be a lot easier.

76
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:07,098
Hey, kid, is this yours?

77
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,365
Yeah.

78
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,366
Yeah. Do me a favor,
will you?

79
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:10,734
Put that right under the seat,

80
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:12,435
and see maybe if you can
keep that with you.

81
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,870
Because I got
some important stuff
in this bag.

82
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:16,471
I'd like to keep it
close by me.

83
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:17,838
You know what I mean?

84
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,641
(Grunts) Thanks.

85
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:22,942
That's really nice of you.

86
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:25,477
Good kid. Thank you.

87
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,278
Okay.

88
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,583
Attaboy. It fits
right under there.

89
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:35,985
No, it doesn't fit
right under there.

90
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:37,453
Maybe you'll
get a little spot
in another bin.

91
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,555
Thanks. I appreciate that.
It's nice of you.

92
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,011
Excuse me.

93
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:07,846
Careful. Careful.

94
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:14,117
I almost didn't make it.

95
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,885
I'm sure someone's
glad you did.

96
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:17,486
Let's see. 49-c.

97
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,787
It's right down this way.

98
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,221
Okay. Thanks.

99
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,991
49-c, sir.
It's right here.

100
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,227
Hmm, baby stuff.

101
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,395
Let me see...

102
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,797
Excuse me, sir.
Is this yours?

103
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,098
Yeah.

104
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,133
I'm sorry. We'll need
to use this compartment.

105
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:39,734
Would you mind
using another one?

106
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:42,803
Because I have valuable
family heirlooms in there.

107
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,571
Okay...
Sir, as you
can plainly see,

108
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:46,139
this is an emergency situation.

109
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,141
Maybe you can use
somebody else's bin.

110
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:50,409
I mean, this kid's
not using all of his.
Would you mind if...

111
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,411
Hey, excuse me, but screw you.

112
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:54,479
Hey, hey, come on, be nice.

113
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:55,947
Be a gentleman, will you?

114
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,782
We're trying to
help over here.
Let me help you.

115
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,350
Look, pal, this goes
right under here.

116
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:01,151
Wait.
No, this is small.

117
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,719
Man: That's okay. Thanks.
Don't... don't...

118
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:04,187
What... wait, don't kick it!

119
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,422
For God's sake!
Those are live human organs!

120
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:07,623
Excuse me, sir!

121
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,825
Trust me, pal.
They don't feel it.

122
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:13,094
Would you sit down, please?

123
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,663
Here you go, sir.
I'm really sorry about that.

124
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,264
Sir, we're gonna
have to use your bin.

125
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,999
Excuse me. But...

126
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,334
And actually, sir,
I think your bag is
over the size limit.

127
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:23,635
Well, no, because, see,

128
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,303
the guy outside measured this,

129
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:26,671
and he said that it was okay.

130
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:28,572
Sir, it's clearly
over the size limit.

131
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:30,273
It will have to go in cargo.

132
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:31,841
Listen,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

133
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:33,876
Hold on. Hold on a second.
Listen.

134
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:37,646
Maybe we could
just leave my bag
where it is,

135
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,080
all right?

136
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,448
Are you trying
to bribe me, sir?

137
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,817
No. I'm trying to purchase
a place for my bag...

138
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,486
The place for your bag
is in cargo, sir.

139
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,622
Excuse me.
Maybe I'll just take
another flight.

140
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:51,524
Fine. The next flight
to San Diego leaves
in 7 hours, sir.

141
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:53,058
Well, let me make a phone call.

142
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,593
Sir, do you actually
think that we're
gonna hold the plane

143
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,161
while you use the phone?

144
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,195
Now, are you flying
with us tonight or not?

145
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,797
All right, miss Burke.
Yes?

146
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,165
That's your name, right?
Yes.

147
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,900
This bag better be
in San Diego.

148
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:07,701
You're gonna be in a lot
of trouble if it's not.

149
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,903
Yes, sir. It will be
the very first off the plane.

150
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,371
Does that make you happy?

151
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:13,306
When it's there,
then I'll be happy.
Okay.

152
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,041
Have a seat, please.
Thank you.

153
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:20,145
Happy?

154
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,613
Happy? Yeah, I'm happy.

155
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:22,914
I'm thrilled.

156
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,015
Happy.

157
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:26,750
What are you looking at?

158
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:29,252
You started all this
with those frigging organs.

159
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:31,354
You're happy, right?
Happy!

160

I'm going to meet
my girlfriend's parents.

Yes.

171

She's great.
She's just great.

the same of me.

gonna say to them, okay?

178
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:17,356
Yeah. I don't know,
because, I mean,
I haven't even met them,

already the father,
he doesn't like me,
I know.

180
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,627
I could understand that.
I just met you,
and I don't like you either.

181

183
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,799
Good. Make it

No.

00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:02,304
Excuse me, but...

321
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:04,339
You invited me
to your parents' house,

322
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:07,208
and then you called
and said we're coming
to Mexico instead.

323
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,909
When I said we were
going to Mexico,

324
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:10,610
I didn't actually mean you.

325
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:12,378
What?

326
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,180
It was just supposed
to be me and my parents
for my dad's birthday,

327
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,948
and you got so excited,
I didn't...

328
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,950
I didn't know
how to break it to you.

329
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,255
Laurie, what's happened to you?

330
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,424
Six months at home
and you've mutated

331
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,826
from a fun-loving
free spirit into...

332
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,961
Nancy Reagan.

333
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:36,064
Look, I just want stability
in my life, Charlie.

334
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,365
I need to be with someone

335
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,233
who really knows who they are,

336
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:42,236
and knows
what they want in life.

337
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:44,004
You know what
this is all about?

338
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:45,438
Your folks.

339
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,906
They don't like me,

340
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:49,174
and it's affecting the way
that you feel about me,

341
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,376
but just wait, Laurie.

342
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:53,010
My being here
will turn out to be

343
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:54,578
a blessing in disguise.

344
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm not giving up
on you, Laurie.

345
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,116
Is my hair all right?
I'm open-minded.

346
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:03,717
It's just that he's such a dip!

347
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:06,186
Do you think he's a dip?
I think he's really cute,

348
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,887
and he seems funny,
and he seems smart...

349
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,855
And, I mean,
what do you want for, wooly?

350
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:12,157
I want what I was
when I was his age.

351
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,191
Mmm.

352
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:14,792
I was charismatic...

353
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:16,393
Mmm-hmm.
Ambitious.

354
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:18,495
That's right.
I was clearly
headed to the top.

355
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:19,696
Clearly, darling.

356
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:22,231
The very, very top.

357
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:25,734
I mean, we can be
honest with each other

358
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,535
when we're alone, can't we?

359
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:29,203
Oh, I think
that's a good idea, wooly.

360
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,205
I mean, I've always
wanted to be...

361
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,973
Oh, I forgot something!

362
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:34,574
Will you go down
and get us a table?

363
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,876
What's the problem?
No problem.
I just forgot something,

364
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:38,677
and I'll be there
in just a second, okay?

365
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,778
I'm running.

366
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,112
(Bell rings)

367
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:48,050
(Knocking on door)

368
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:37,164
(Gasping for breath)

369
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,426
<i>(Mariachi music playing)</i>

370
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,540
Oh... <i> Senorita,</i>
no, no. Listen.

371
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,842
Decoration.
Not for sale. Sorry.

372
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,750
I better go check on bear.

373
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:38,019
Ah, Mrs. Bennett.

374
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,086
Dick:
Oh, there you are, bear.

375
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:40,454
We ordered you an enchilada.

376
00:18:49,464 --> 00:18:50,863
Bear, are you all right?

377
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:51,997
Mrs. Bennett...

378
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:53,098
Laurie: Oh, Jesus.

379
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,732
Mom, are you okay?

380
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,434
Would you like to sit?

381
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,269
Mom, what are you doing?

382
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,408
Good God, bear,
don't tell me you've
been drinking again.

383
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,509
Now, remember
what the doctor said.

384
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,644
Take nice, deep breaths.

385
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,278
I have some pills
if you're not feeling well.

386
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,246
That's a good idea.
Why don't you take them...

387
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:16,750
(Stuttering) It's...

388
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:18,917
All right, folks.

389
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,485
She's just a little hungry.

390
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:24,621
She's hungry,
and her blood sugar's
dropped.

391
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,055
Are you hungry, bear?

392
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:27,489
Laurie:
Mom, for God's sake!

393
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:30,190
Would you like an enchilada?

394
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,391
(Screaming)

395
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:38,730
It's all right, folks.
No harm done.

396
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,798
They're just...
Happy to see each other.

397
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:11,494
You little son of a bitch.

398
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:14,096
I should've known. Huh!

399
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:25,739
(Snoring)

400
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:01,307
Huh?

401
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,843
Wake up, qaddafi.

402
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:06,377
We're gonna play college bowl.

403
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:08,712
For 10 points or your life...

404
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,013
Hey, Stevie...
Where's Charlie?

405
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,447
You got any notes
from last night?

406
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:12,614
I don't need 'em.

407
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,048
Hey!

408
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,983
No, no, I've got it.
Thank you very much.

409
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,788
<i>Senorita,</i> your mother
is going to be fine.

410
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:25,323
Take this, please.

411
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,224
<i>Senor,</i> I gave her a sedative.

412
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:29,392
<i>Es muy, muy</i> strong.
Let her rest, huh?

413
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:30,826
Thank you, doctor.

414
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:34,228
We've only been
back here an hour,

415
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,629
and already she's on the booze.

416
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:36,963
Would you go easy on her, dad?

417
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:39,431
She's obviously
under a lot of stress.

418
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,666
Okay.

419
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,034
When she wakes up,

420
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,136
we won't mention
a thing, okay, Laurie?

421
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,271
Why don't you watch her

422
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,873
while Charlie and I go
rent a boat for tomorrow?

423
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,207
Okay, Charlie?

424
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:53,641
Yeah. Great.

425
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:54,775
(Gasps)

426
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:56,176
Is my hair okay?

427
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:04,849
(Stammers)
Do you mind if I change
my shirt before we go?

428
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:07,351
No. I'll use the phone
in your room

429
00:22:07,353 --> 00:22:08,652
so I won't disturb her.

430
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,223
Tommy: All right.
We're gonna play
a game called

431
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:15,857
"be honest with me."

432
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,059
Now, the rules are very simple.

433
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:20,894
I ask you a question,

434
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:23,830
and you have to be
honest with me, okay?

435
00:22:23,832 --> 00:22:26,299
Now, where'd
Charlie pritchett
go on vacation?

436
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,667
(Muffled speech)

437
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,368
Second rule.

438
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,236
You have to answer, qaddafi.

439
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:35,105
(Muffled)
Why does he keep
calling me qaddafi?

440
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:36,172
(Muffled) I don't know.

441
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:38,007
Now, look,

442
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:40,676
I don't want to have to
put you kids through hell.

443
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,444
So...

444
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,913
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen here.

445
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:47,948
First, I'm gonna hurt you.

446
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,183
Then you're gonna
try to be brave.

447
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:51,784
Then I'm gonna hurt you again.

448
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:52,951
Then you're gonna
tell me everything.

449
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:54,285
(Muffled)
We don't know anything.

450
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:55,452
(Muffled) We don't know.

451
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:56,719
That's not being honest.

452
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:59,688
That's not honest.
That's not honest.

453
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,822
(Muffled screaming)

454
00:23:01,658 --> 00:23:03,024
Now, look.

455
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:05,026
This is not gonna
get any easier.

456
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:07,094
It's only gonna get harder.

457
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:08,995
So I don't know
why you're protecting
this kid,

458
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:10,696
'cause I'm gonna find him.

459
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:14,165
Here we go. Here we go.
Attaboy.

460
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:16,100
I swear to God,
we don't know where he is.

461
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:17,434
All he said was Mexico,
and he's...

462
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:18,768
(Screams)

463
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,537
Come on!
We're not trying
to protect him!

464
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,205
We're not... ow!

465
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:24,539
I won't repeat myself.

466
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,740
Ow!
Hmm?

467
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:32,512
Mom, if you want to come down,
you're certainly welcome.

468
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:34,347
It's just that
the weather is terrible.

469
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:35,715
<i>Mom: What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

470
00:23:35,717 --> 00:23:36,849
It's rained
since we got here, mom.

471
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,417
There's storms everywhere.

472
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,652
I mean, more storms
are on the way.

473
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:42,920
Mom, I'm just
thinking about you.

474
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,389
Mom... of course
we'd love to have

475
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,190
your company, mom.

476
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,992
Well, I know you're
young enough to travel.

477
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,259
It has nothing to do with that.

478
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:51,927
<i>I know.</i>
<i>It has to do with her.</i>

479
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:54,796
Mom, please. Please, mom,
don't dredge that up.

480
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:55,863
(Yells)

481
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:58,065
(Charlie yells)

482
00:23:58,067 --> 00:23:59,399
What's the matter?

483
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:01,134
(Stuttering) You okay?

484
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:02,802
Ants! Ants everywhere!

485
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:06,105
Ants? I don't see any ants.
What you talking about?

486
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:09,575
Mom, there are
ants down here.
Ants everywhere.

487
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:11,610
Mom, please don't
dredge that up.

488
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:14,079
Because it's got
nothing to do with her!

489
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:15,846
(Yells)

490
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:17,247
What is it?
What is it?

491
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,448
Dick: What is it?

492
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,750
I have a cramp in my leg.

493
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:21,884
A cramp?

494
00:24:21,886 --> 00:24:23,185
(Groans)

495
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:25,620
Well, pull yourself together.
Stop screaming!

496
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:27,588
Mom? Mom, sorry. I'm...

497
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,456
No, mom, I'm not
arguing with my wife.

498
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,858
I'm arguing with you!
I mean, mom...

499
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,726
Please, I'll have
to call you back.

500
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:36,195
Mom, I'll call you back.
I'll call you right back.

501
00:24:36,197 --> 00:24:37,896
Will you keep it down?

502
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:40,331
Why don't I meet you
downstairs in the lobby in,
say, five minutes?

503
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,465
Five minutes!
All right?

504
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:42,599
Five <i> minutos!</i>

505
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:44,033
And don't send this
laundry out.

506
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:45,701
It's gonna cost me
an arm and a leg.

507
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:53,507
God.

508
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:58,610
(Mumbling)

509
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:00,545
Obviously this is...

510
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:01,913
This isn't real.

511
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:06,450
It's...

512
00:25:06,452 --> 00:25:07,751
It's...

513
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:08,985
It's a fake.

514
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:10,319
It's a fake.

515
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,756
(Yells)

516
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:19,327
<i>Senor! Senor!</i>

517
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:21,928
Are you okay?

518
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,996
(Stammers) I'm fine.

519
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:26,598
I ate a hot pepper.

520
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,666
Oh! Hot! Hot pepper!

521
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:29,767
(Speaking Spanish)

522
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,568
No, no, no. Bad dog.

523
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:33,536
Charlie, are you okay?

524
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:36,505
I'm fine. I just
ate a killer pepper.

525
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:38,707
A killer pepper.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

526
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,308
There's some water
in the minibar, sir...

527
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,310
No! No, no.

528
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:44,412
I like the sensation.

529
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:46,247
Yee-hah!

530
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:47,948
Yee-hah!

531
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,417
Enchilada!

532
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:53,586
Okay. Well, you call me
if you need anything, eh?

533
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:55,154
Will do. Thank you, paco.

534
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:56,421
(Speaking Spanish)

535
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:57,488
Pepe!

536
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,956
(Speaking Spanish)

537
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,192
God!
What's going on?

538
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,793
The police! This has got
to be a setup. Oh, God...

539
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,860
What's the matter?

540
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,428
There's got to be
a camera or something.

541
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,997
We're in Mexico.
Why would there be
a camera in Mexico?

542
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,532
Mexican <i> candid camera.</i>
Still on the air!

543
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:12,866
Charlie!

544
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:14,434
You're acting insane.

545
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,569
I'm okay.
Would you get it together?

546
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:18,771
Okay?
I'm okay. I'm okay.

547
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,239
What the hell's going on?

548
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,507
Look, Laurie,

549
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:24,942
you got to promise
you won't freak, okay?

550
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:26,209
Okay.

551
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:29,311
I found something
in my duffel bag.

552
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:32,147
Something...

553
00:26:33,483 --> 00:26:36,116
I mean... look, it's a...

554
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:37,150
What?

555
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,484
Forget it. It's nothing.

556
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:43,287
Charlie pritchett,
this is sweet!

557
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:44,388
No!

558
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,989
You got me a present!

559
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:47,957
No!
I didn't think
you'd got me...

560
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,191
It's not a present, Laurie!

561
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,393
Laurie, don't open it.
It's a head!

562
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,297
Laurie?

563
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,332
Laurie!

564
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:00,800
Are you okay?

565
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:02,535
Honey.
Yeah.

566
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:06,939
(Screaming)

567
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:09,174
(Muffled screaming)

568
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:10,675
(Knocking on door)

569
00:27:13,646 --> 00:27:15,078
<i>Senora,</i> are you all right?

570
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,980
She's fine.
Everything's fine.

571
00:27:17,982 --> 00:27:20,248
She had a pepper, too.
She loves them, actually.

572
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,049
Are you sure, <i> senorita?</i>

573
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:25,585
(Pepe growling)

574
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,420
(Paco speaking Spanish)

575
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,934
You call me
if you need anything, eh?

576
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:45,168
Will do.

577
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,203
Thank you, paco.
Bye-bye.

578
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:54,142
Laurie, are you okay?

579
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:55,776
Can you stop screaming?

580
00:27:57,546 --> 00:28:00,346
Good God, Charlie,
what are you doing
with a head in your bag?

581
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:02,448
I don't know.
You think I know?

582
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,949
Yes, I think you'd know!

583
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:06,151
If I had a head
in my bag,
I think I'd know!

584
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,119
Laurie, don't get upset,

585
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,720
but there's more than one.

586
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,387
What?

587
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:13,989
Charlie, there's two?

588
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,824
Uh-uh. No.

589
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:17,558
Three? Four? How many?

590
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:20,627
Eight.

591
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:22,694
(Screaming)

592
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:24,562
Laurie! Laurie! Wait!

593
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:28,399
(Speaking Spanish)

594
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:30,633
Laurie!

595
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:32,201
You're not in the hall.
You're in the closet.

596
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:33,936
Laurie: Don't you think
I realize that?

597
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:35,137
Laurie.

598
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,705
I'm not coming out.

599
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:38,173
Laurie...
I'm not!

600
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:41,842
You have to come out.
No.

601
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:43,043
The bodies are in there.

602
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:44,244
(Screaming)

603
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:47,580
I was kidding.
I was kidding.

604
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:52,317
Kidding? You're kidding
at a time like this?

605
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,085
I had to calm you down.

606
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:56,287
For God's sake,
try and stay calm, okay?

607
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:58,789
Calm? You expect me
to remain calm

608
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,857
when you have
eight human heads
in your luggage?

609
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:06,795
Laurie, there may
be two people in China
who didn't hear you.

610
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:09,230
Well, then,
what the hell's
going on?

611
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:11,565
I wish I knew.

612
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:16,970
Could it be Steve or Ernie
playing some sort of sick,
hideous medical prank?

613
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,771
I don't think so.

614
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,339
The thought of blood
bothers Steve,

615
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,174
and this isn't Ernie's style.

616
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,109
They're my best friends.

617
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:27,312
But come on,
they're dull guys
with dull lives.

618
00:29:27,314 --> 00:29:29,280
You're psycho!
Oh, jeez, Louise!

619
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:30,447
You're psycho!

620
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,816
We don't know
anything, all right?

621
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:34,117
I don't know shit!

622
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:36,485
You're right.

623
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:39,221
Besides,
the only heads we have
access to are cadavers.

624
00:29:39,223 --> 00:29:41,556
These heads are fresh.
Charlie.

625
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:43,457
I'm sorry, but it's true.
Check it out for yourself.

626
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:46,626
No. Let's just
call the police.

627
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:48,394
No. No. No.

628
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:49,528
Why?

629
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,063
Because we're
in Mexico, Laurie.

630
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:53,364
A third-world country.

631
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:55,766
You don't just call the police
in a third-world country

632
00:29:55,768 --> 00:29:58,301
and tell them you found
eight human heads
in your luggage!

633
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:01,270
Why not?
Because they have
no laws here.

634
00:30:01,272 --> 00:30:02,638
They'll turn me into a taco.

635
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,040
All right.
What do you suggest, then?

636
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:10,377
We have to think this thing
through rationally, okay?

637
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,579
Oh, my God, Charlie.

638
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:14,280
What if they have your bag?

639
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:15,581
What?
Your bag.

640
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,517
What if the person
who owns this bag
has your bag?

641
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,318
They're gonna come
looking for you.

642
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,954
Uh...

643
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:27,023
(Stammers) Laurie,
I just took a mental
inventory of my bag.

644
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:30,227
There's nothing in that bag
that could possibly
lead them here.

645
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,195
His family lives
in cleary, Vermont.

646
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,763
They're in
the furniture business.

647
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,831
Laurie's from Denver,
last name Bennett.

648
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:39,433
B-e-n-n-e-t-t.

649
00:30:39,435 --> 00:30:42,302
On vacation in Mexico.

650
00:30:42,304 --> 00:30:44,037
Okay, that's reassuring.

651
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:46,906
What do we do?

652
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:48,941
Simple.

653
00:30:48,943 --> 00:30:51,610
All we have to do
is throw them away.

654
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:08,993
They lock the garbage.

655
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:13,997
Paco: <i> Senor</i> pritchett?

656
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:18,600
Paco.

657
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:19,734
Can I help you?

658
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:21,168
No, no.

659
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,938
(Stammers) Just putting
the trash in the garbage.

660
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,906
Putting the garbage
in the trash, you know?

661
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:29,240
Well, I'll take it for you.

662
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:30,741
No, no. I got it.
What is it?

663
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:33,376
It's... it's none
of your business.

664
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:35,578
No, <i> senor.</i> I meant,
what kind
of garbage is it,

665
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,213
aluminum, plastic?
We recycle here.

666
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:41,416
(Stuttering) It's really
not recyclable. It's...

667
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:43,350
It's perishable.

668
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:45,752
Oh. Well, you...
Perishables, we compost.

669
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,320
It's really not compostable.

670
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,688
Sure, it is.

671
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,524
Everything perishable
is compostable.

672
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:52,992
Jesus Christ!

673
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,293
(Barks)

674
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:55,861
I mean, come on.

675
00:31:56,897 --> 00:31:58,663
Sorry, <i> senor.</i>

676
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:00,431
Go ahead and put it in.

677
00:32:03,903 --> 00:32:05,669
I'll take care of it later.

678
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:09,605
Actually, you know what?
It's fine.

679
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:11,673
I'll just take it back.

680
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:14,108
It's really not that bad,
and...

681
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,978
I just need a little oil
and formaldehyde and vinegar,

682
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,647
and it'll be just as good as...

683
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:22,715
Are you sure, <i> senor?</i>

684
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:25,084
Yes. Thank you, paco.

685
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:30,922
Dick: Mom, why are you
bringing my inheritance
into this?

686
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:31,789
<i>Mom: (On phone)</i>
<i>It's my money.</i>

687
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,357
Excuse me.

688
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,892
You still haven't changed?
What are you doing?

689
00:32:35,894 --> 00:32:37,260
Well, I...

690
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:38,828
No, not you, mom.

691
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,730
(Stuttering)
I found a rat in my room.

692
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:43,531
And it had a ball of yarn...

693
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:46,400
I don't want to be rude,
but are you coming,

694
00:32:46,402 --> 00:32:49,169
or am I gonna spend
the entire day waiting
in the lobby for you?

695
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:52,038
You're so right.
I'm so sorry.
I'll be right down.

696
00:32:54,175 --> 00:32:56,308
<i>Mom: You've sided</i>
<i>with her all along.</i>

697
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,581
What am I gonna do, flush them?

698
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,350
Nothing

699
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,317

702
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,521
No, no, no.

00:33:20,727 --> 00:33:23,027
No clean.
No clean. <i> Gracias.</i>

706
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:25,429
I mean,
I'm asking you
to come, mom,

707
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:27,931
but there's really
no need for you to come.

708
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:29,999
It's 200 degrees here.
<i>Mom: Uh-huh.</i>

709
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:31,867
And you go in here.

710
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,637
Like that.

711
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,640
Mom, if we're cut off,
it's the lightning.

712
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,741
<i>What?</i>

713
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,412
Okay.

714
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,650
Gotta go rent a boat.

715
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:52,151
I've got eight
human heads in my room,

716
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:54,086
and I gotta go rent a boat.

717
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:55,686
Okay.

718
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:12,034
(Sliding)

719
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:13,101
(Thumping)

720
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,336
Ernie: Mrs. pritchett?

721
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:18,771
Hi. This is
Ernie lipscomb,

722
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:20,472
Charlie's friend
from medical school...

723
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,640
Great. In acapulco,
please, then.

724
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:25,976
The numbers for as many hotels
as you can give me.

725
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:28,044
I know. I know.
It is late.

726
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:31,180
It's just we've run
into a little bit of
a situation up here...

727
00:34:31,182 --> 00:34:32,748
All right. Okay.
The Mayan.

728
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:36,718
No, no, no. Relax.
Everything's fine,

729
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,120
but I do need to get
a hold of Charlie.

730
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:41,055
Did he by any chance tell you

731
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:43,424
what hotel he was
staying at Mexico?

732
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:45,258
Uh-huh.

733
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:46,826
Uh-huh.

734
00:34:48,229 --> 00:34:49,494
He didn't.

735
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,963
Right. No. I know
how sons can be.

736
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:55,931
All right.
That's the last one, right?

737
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,165
I'm good.

738
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,133
School's a little crazy.

739
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:01,168
You know how that goes.

740
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,537
You sure he's only
going away for a week?

741
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:05,472
He packed enough
stuff here for a year.

742
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:07,340
Charlie's a compulsive packer.

743
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,543
<i>"Sleight of mind"</i>
by Charlie pritchett
again.

744
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:14,512
He's writing a detective novel.

745
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:16,680
Yeah. It sounds like
his autobiography.

746
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,315
It's a pun on slight-of-hand
and dim-witted.

747
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,517
You know, a pun.
Play on words. Get it?

748
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,521
No, no, no. Relax.
Everything's fine.

749
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:29,957
Mmm-hmm.

750
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:32,292
Oh, I don't know.
We got midterms.

751
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:33,693
(Gun firing)

752
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:40,398
I'll talk to you soon.
Gotta go. Bye.

753
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,899
(Shuddering) Shit.

754
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:49,304
I popped the last guy
who tried
to pun me, asshole.

755
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:50,405
Get it?

756
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:53,073
You get it?

757
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:54,407
Yeah, I can get it, too.

758
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:56,108
Make some more calls.

759
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,809
You, too, asshole.

760
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:04,648
Charlie, this is none
of my business, hopefully,
but let's review.

761
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,816
You've been pre-law,
pre-architect,

762
00:36:06,818 --> 00:36:08,050
pre-vet, pre-med.

763
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:09,217
No. Real med.

764
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:10,885
And now Laurie
tells me this week

765
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,019
you're thinking about
becoming a headshrinker.

766
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:16,021
Charlie.

767
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:18,356
(Stammers) What?

768
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,791
Shrink. Headshrinker.
Psychoanalyst.

769
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:23,293
Whatever you call
an overpaid hand-holder
these days.

770
00:36:23,295 --> 00:36:26,763
Actually, sir,
I was thinking about that,

771
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:29,365
but I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

772
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:30,733
I'm certainly aware of that.

773
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:31,900
Dad, enough.

774
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:45,079

775
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:57,390
Annette?

776
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,295
Bear?

777
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:05,664
Annette:
Wooly, are we alone?

778
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,465
Yeah, we're alone,
but where are you?

779
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:09,566
Oh, wooly.

780
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:11,433
What are you doing there?

781
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:13,868
Wooly, wooly, thank God.

782
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,502
Thank God you're alive.

783
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:17,003
Still alive?
Of course I'm still alive.

784
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:18,304
Where's Laurie?

785
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:20,172
Where's Laurie?
Not with him.

786
00:37:20,174 --> 00:37:22,140
Oh, my God,
not with that maniac.

787
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:24,242
Honey, calm down
and tell me what
you're talking about.

788
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:28,412
What I'm talking about?
Our daughter
is dating a mass murderer.

789
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:31,615
I went into his room
to take a gift
to put in his bag,

790
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:34,484
and in his bag,
he's got body parts.

791
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,259

792
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:26,433

No, you don't believe me.

797

Yes, I do believe you.

798
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:42,445
But you remember
what the doctor said
about your drinking.

799
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:46,081
I did not hallucinate it.
I had the drink

What about the pills?

00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:50,884
I saw you take them.
You said yourself
they made you woozy.

802
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,452
Right.

803
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:58,756
But then what about the bag?
Okay, where's his bag?

804
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:01,592
I don't know,
but I was in his room
when he unpacked.

805
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:04,161
He unpacked
right in front of me.
Would a maniac do that?

806
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,699
(Grunting)

807
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:18,004
Oh, no.

808

Oh, no.

00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:20,339
Oh, no.

810

No, no, no.

No.

812

No!

813
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,020
It's not my room.

814
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:39,787
It's not my room!

815
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:40,721
(Laughs)

816
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,823
It is my room.

817
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,124
Okay.

818

<i>Senor.</i>
What?

819
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:54,362
We clean room.
What?

820
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:56,297
Room clean.
Oh, no.

821

I'm blind.

826
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,746
I mean, you're blind.

827
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,114
I mean, I'm a guest

828
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,283

I draw the line on mass graves.

834
00:41:26,408 --> 00:41:28,141
Mass graves?

835
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:31,043
You know, maybe we should
just do individual
seven of them, you know?

836
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:32,844
We don't have time.

837
00:41:32,846 --> 00:41:35,680
You know what?
This reminds me
of when I was a kid.

838
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:37,715
I was 13 years old,

839
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:42,219
and me and my friends
used to rip the heads
off Barbie dolls

840
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:45,755
and bury them in the mud
in the backyard.

841
00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:47,723
Really? You used
to rip the heads...

(Greeting in Spanish)

843

Find any buried treasures,
gringos?

844
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,129
(Softly) Shit.

845
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:58,332
We have laws
about these deserts.

846
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:01,501
They're environmentally
protected now, you know?

847
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:02,969
Actually, no, we didn't know.

848
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:04,437
(Speaking Spanish)

849
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,439
We got to protect the snakes,

850
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,742
protect the lizards,
protect the toads.

851
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:13,378
Are you familiar with
the Mexican horny toad,
<i>chiquita?</i>

852
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,645
Oh, no.

853
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:17,180
Oh, yeah.
The Mexican horny toad

854
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:19,849
is a very special species.

855
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:22,618
It's against the law
to hurt a horny toad
in any way.

856
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,885
(Grunts)

857

No!

Shit!

864
00:42:45,937 --> 00:42:47,970
They stole my car.

(Speaking Spanish)
Dick is gonna kill me.

868
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,110
Officer: I want you to stay
here at your hotel.

869
00:42:59,112 --> 00:43:00,511
You're much safer here.

870
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:01,912
Okay.

875
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:15,954
Thank you. Good night.

876
00:43:18,992 --> 00:43:20,358
That went well.

877
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,260
Charlie, I got it.
Fedex.

878

What?
Fedex 'em to Steve.

879
00:43:26,265 --> 00:43:30,066
Fedex.
Laurie, we're in Mexico.
There is no fedex.

880

Well, then, mexex them.
I don't care.

881
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:33,835
The point is, just ship 'em.

882
00:43:33,837 --> 00:43:37,505
And just let Steve innocently
open a package full of heads?

883
00:43:37,507 --> 00:43:39,106
Of course not.
We'll call him.

884
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:43,743
All right, boys, I would
like to do this forever,

I don't know
what else to do,
you know.

887
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:50,982
I think it's time
that I got rid of you two
and moved along.

888

Come on.
Come over here.

889
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:54,752
What? You can't
just kill us.

890

We're trying, all right.

891
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:57,587
Trying? What are
you talking about?

892

What's this look like,

I need the bag.
Get over here!

Wait. I...

895
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:03,891
Trying?
You should get down.

896
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:06,226

It might be Charlie.

00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:37,175
My dad will shoot himself.

964
00:46:37,177 --> 00:46:38,776
What are we gonna tell him?

965
00:46:38,778 --> 00:46:42,045
Dick: What do you mean
he forgot to turn in
his lab report?

966
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:43,112
Laurie:
I know it sounds flaky...

967
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:44,646
Flaky? It's ridiculous.

968
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:46,280
You mean he came
all the way to Mexico

969
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:47,648
without turning in a report,

970
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,383
and for that,
we have to go home?

971
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:51,151
Mom's sick, and anyway,
it's your fault.

972
00:46:51,153 --> 00:46:52,385
My fault?

973
00:46:52,387 --> 00:46:54,387
He took your advice.
He's decided on something.

974
00:46:54,389 --> 00:46:57,323
He's decided
he'll never be
a member of this family.

975
00:46:57,325 --> 00:46:58,257
That's for sure.

976
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:01,893
(Knock on door)

977
00:47:01,895 --> 00:47:03,060
We're leaving.

978
00:47:03,062 --> 00:47:04,828
How did he take it?

979
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,832
Well, it's gonna have to
fall into the category
of blessing in disguise.

980
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:12,135
I'll make it up to him.
I'll give him a year
of free analysis.

981
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:13,402
Cute. Here.

982
00:47:13,871 --> 00:47:15,370
What's this?

983
00:47:15,372 --> 00:47:17,372
It's a surprise
for his birthday.

984
00:47:17,374 --> 00:47:19,140
He likes this macho stuff.

985
00:47:20,243 --> 00:47:22,076
Can you pack it in your bag?

986
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:23,510
I don't want him to see it.

987
00:47:23,512 --> 00:47:26,379
Where exactly
would you suggest
that I put it?

988
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:28,481
If we're going,
let's get going.

989
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:29,682
Right, dad.

990
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:33,751
The shirt's for you.
Get packing.

991
00:47:36,288 --> 00:47:37,620
(Door closes)

992
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,397
(Muttering)

993
00:47:54,902 --> 00:47:56,201
(Knock on door)

994
00:47:56,203 --> 00:47:57,569
Maid: Laundry.

995
00:48:01,273 --> 00:48:02,405
I didn't...

996
00:48:07,044 --> 00:48:08,143
Hello.

997
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:10,478
Thank you.

998
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:20,787
(Yells)

999
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:47,212
Hey, who's this guy?
He might do.

1000
00:48:47,747 --> 00:48:48,912
Do for what?

1001
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:49,946
Hugo.

1002
00:48:50,682 --> 00:48:52,214
Ernie: Wait a minute.

1003
00:48:52,216 --> 00:48:53,915
Are you telling us
you're trying to find
a look-alike

1004
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:55,750
for the head Charlie lost?

1005
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:59,186
Yeah. We got some time
to kill before we go
to the airport.

1006
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:00,754
Oh, my God.

1007
00:49:00,756 --> 00:49:02,956
But these are
college professors.

1008
00:49:03,758 --> 00:49:06,091
You know, innocent people.

1009
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:08,026
You can't just kill
innocent people

1010
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,827
because they look like
someone else.

1011
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:12,663
Let me tell you something,
college boy,
nobody's innocent.

1012
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:14,097
Now, who is he?

1013
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,366
He was my anatomy Professor.

1014
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:19,201
He almost flunked me.

1015
00:49:19,203 --> 00:49:21,469
Good. Here's your chance
to get even with the prick.
Get me his address.

1016
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:22,770
All right.

1017
00:49:22,772 --> 00:49:25,239
Wait a minute.
I just thought
of something.

1018
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:26,373
What?

1019
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:28,007
Cryonics.

1020
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:29,241
Cry what?
Cryonics.

1021
00:49:29,743 --> 00:49:31,509
Frozen bodies.

1022
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:35,178
This university has
the biggest cryonics
foundation in the country.

1023
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,445
So what?

1024
00:49:36,447 --> 00:49:39,848
So it could save you
a lot of trouble is so what.

1025
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,850
I mean, look, you go on
a killing spree here,

1026
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:44,118
big sep's gonna hear about it.

1027
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,753
I mean, a couple of
gangsters die,
nobody cares.

1028
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:48,121
But you blow away professors,

1029
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:50,423
big sep's gonna
read about that.

1030
00:49:50,425 --> 00:49:52,758
Mmm-hmm.
Big sep don't read.

1031
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,761
Yeah, well, still,
this cryonics facility

1032
00:49:55,763 --> 00:49:57,662
has hundreds of frozen heads.

1033
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:01,398
Why they got hundreds
of frozen heads?

1034
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,433
I think for situations
like this.

1035
00:50:03,435 --> 00:50:05,301
Hey, don't be a little
smart ass, you.

1036
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:06,969
Look, they have 'em

1037
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:10,138
because people are hoping that
in a couple of hundred years,

1038
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,306
maybe they can bring 'em
back to life,

1039
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:13,573
clone 'em a healthy body.

1040
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:15,575
Are you jerkin' me around?

1041
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:19,812
Oh, my God. You just
put welts and bruises
over 90% of my body.

1042
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:23,048
Now you're talking
about having me help you
decapitate some Professor.

1043
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,283
Would I be jerking you around?

1044
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:27,118
Calm down, tough guy.
What are you trying
to tell me?

1045
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,954
I'm trying to tell you
that right across campus

1046
00:50:30,956 --> 00:50:33,189
is a gold mine of heads.

1047
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:36,358
Heads "r" us.
Night of a thousand heads.

1048
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,327
If I was a guy
in desperate need
of a head,

1049
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:40,795
as you are,

1050
00:50:40,797 --> 00:50:42,363
I'd at least check it out.

1051
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,203
<i>Senor,</i> I can't find
your jeep anywhere.

1052
00:50:50,205 --> 00:50:53,005
What do you mean
you can't find it?
It's red. <i> Rojo.</i>

1053
00:50:53,007 --> 00:50:55,107
Oh, my God. I forgot.

1054
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:57,008
We went for a drive last night,

1055
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,909
and it got stolen.

1056
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:03,346
You forgot it was stolen?

1057
00:51:03,348 --> 00:51:05,147
Well, we...

1058
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,716
This is ridiculous!
How the hell are
we gonna get out of here?

1059
00:51:07,718 --> 00:51:09,617
It's not a problem,
<i>senor.</i> Take a plane.

1060
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:12,186
Oh, a plane. A plane.
Where would we take
a plane from?

1061
00:51:12,188 --> 00:51:14,922
Here. Since you've
been away, <i> senor,</i>

1062
00:51:14,924 --> 00:51:17,291
this has become
a very important city.

1063
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:19,760
We have built our own airport.

1064
00:51:19,762 --> 00:51:22,162
A plane comes every day.

1065
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:23,763
Well, aren't we lucky?

1066
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,872
Now, that's a Hugo.

1067
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:38,308
This one's good?

1068
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,243
For Hugo porto,
it's unbelievable.

1069
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:42,044
All right.
We got a keeper.

1070
00:51:42,713 --> 00:51:44,212
(Screeching)

1071
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:51,218
What was that?

1072
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,752
Thawing it out.

1073
00:51:52,754 --> 00:51:53,753
Huh.

1074
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:02,861
No way.

1075
00:52:04,231 --> 00:52:06,464
Good God, look at that.

1076
00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:08,432
Lassie, sit, girl. Stay.

1077
00:52:09,535 --> 00:52:11,101
Steve: Oh, my God.

1078
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,371
Oh, my God.

1079
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:17,139
Guys. Ernie.

1080
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:18,340
What?

1081
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:20,375
I'm not very comfortable
perhaps.

1082
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:22,377
Why is that?

1083
00:52:22,379 --> 00:52:24,479
We're messing with
people's immortality here.

1084
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:25,613
It's murder.

1085
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:28,482
Technically,
it's not murder, Steve,

1086
00:52:28,484 --> 00:52:29,950
because they're already dead.

1087
00:52:29,952 --> 00:52:33,853
No. These people believed
in this freezing thing.

1088
00:52:33,855 --> 00:52:35,721
This is like grave robbing.

1089
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:38,957
Grave robbing or worse.

1090
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:41,092
I don't see any graves.

1091
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:43,360
Do you see any graves?

1092
00:52:43,362 --> 00:52:45,295
There's gonna be
two fresh ones right now

1093
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:47,463
if you two don't start
looking for heads. Come on.

1094
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,272
All right.

1095
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,806
Sir, I'm really sorry
about the jeep.

1096
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,207
It's open seating.

1097
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:03,410
Take these tickets
and you check in
the big stuff.

1098
00:53:03,412 --> 00:53:06,246
We'll take the little stuff,
and we'll go get the seats.

1099
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:07,947
Do you think
you can handle that?

1100
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:09,481
Yes. I really appreciate...

1101
00:53:09,483 --> 00:53:10,815
Come on, bear. Come here.

1102
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:13,617
(Dick speaking Spanish)

1103
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,919
(Speaking Spanish)

1104
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:18,353
Do you have anything
to declare?

1105
00:53:18,355 --> 00:53:20,555
Any fruits? Vegetables?
Native plants?

1106
00:53:20,557 --> 00:53:22,089
Are you kidding?

1107
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,796
Anything to declare?
Fruits? Vegetables?

1108
00:53:34,101 --> 00:53:35,633
Sobrino! Sobrino!

1109
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:37,735
I'll get it.

1110
00:53:37,737 --> 00:53:40,437
(Men speaking Spanish)

1111
00:53:42,674 --> 00:53:44,607
Excuse me. Could you
hand me my bag, please?

1112
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:45,975
(Speaking Spanish)

1113
00:53:45,977 --> 00:53:47,543
I don't have <i> un momento.</i>

1114
00:53:47,545 --> 00:53:50,245
I have un plane-o
to catch-o. Got it?

1115
00:53:50,247 --> 00:53:51,412
(Speaking Spanish)

1116
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,349
Excuse me.
It's right there.
I can see it.

1117
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,484
I'll just reach in
and get it myself, okay?

1118
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:00,252
<i>Senor,</i> no. No, <i> senor.</i>

1119
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:01,453
(Yells)

1120
00:54:01,455 --> 00:54:02,821
Halt!

1121
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:03,988
(Annette screams)

1122
00:54:09,862 --> 00:54:11,461
What? Is it dad?

1123
00:54:11,463 --> 00:54:12,595
(Babbles)

1124
00:54:12,597 --> 00:54:14,063
Is it dad?

1125
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:16,264
What?

1126
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:20,366
They found two heads
in dad's carry-on.

1127
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:22,968
Oh, no.

1128
00:54:26,206 --> 00:54:27,738
Dick: Put me down.
Put me down.

1129
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,872
Oh, my God.

1130
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,074
Help me. Help me.

1131
00:54:36,446 --> 00:54:37,545
Oh, my God.

1132
00:54:45,588 --> 00:54:46,753
Decent. Hold this one.

1133
00:54:46,755 --> 00:54:48,054
Yeah? Wait.

1134
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,890
Do you need a Helen?

1135
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:53,192
No. You can play
with her when I leave.
Get over there.

1136
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:58,563
This guy do anything for you?

1137
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:03,700
He's not bad either.
COD be a stu.

1138
00:55:04,936 --> 00:55:07,770
Ernie: Yeah? We could beat
him up a little bit,

1139
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:09,004
give him a few cuts.

1140
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:10,872
Random disfigurement.

1141
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:14,442
Yeah, definitely a stu.

1142
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,710
It's worth a try anyway.
I'll take him,
and I'll take him.

1143
00:55:16,712 --> 00:55:17,877
Ernie: Great.
I'll wrap them up.

1144
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:21,479
What do you mean, "take," huh?

1145
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:23,413
You know,

1146
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:26,415
for a future doctor,

1147
00:55:26,417 --> 00:55:28,583
you're a pretty stupid kid.

1148
00:55:28,585 --> 00:55:30,851
I mean take the heads.

1149
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:39,058
No. No. No. No way.

1150
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:42,928
You do it. This was
your crazy idea, okay?

1151
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,497
It's my idea that
you should do it.

1152
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:46,831
But he's the neurologist.

1153
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,766
I'm only going
into dermatology.

1154
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:51,701
So don't screw up the skin.

1155
00:56:01,311 --> 00:56:03,144
(Saw buzzing loudly)

1156
00:56:06,516 --> 00:56:08,415
Now there's a pleasant sound.

1157
00:56:14,189 --> 00:56:16,556
Mr. escobedo,
this is my mother Annette,

1158
00:56:16,558 --> 00:56:19,425
Charlie, and fern Bennett,
dad's mom.

1159
00:56:19,427 --> 00:56:21,960
She flew down to
help us out with bail.

1160
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,262
Nana, this is
dad's Mexican lawyer.

1161
00:56:24,264 --> 00:56:25,663
Delighted.

1162
00:56:25,665 --> 00:56:27,765
Charmed.
Now cut the crap

1163
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:29,433
and tell us
what the hell's
going on.

1164
00:56:29,435 --> 00:56:30,567
Certainly.

1165
00:56:30,569 --> 00:56:31,601
(Clears throat)

1166
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:36,538
<i>Amigos,</i> in your country,
you have what you call

1167
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,574
the good news and the bad news.

1168
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:43,643
The good news is that
Mr. Bennett underwent
only very mild torture.

1169
00:56:43,645 --> 00:56:46,646
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, my God.

1170
00:56:46,648 --> 00:56:49,248
Shut up, you poodle.
What's the bad news?

1171
00:56:50,584 --> 00:56:52,517
He confessed
and was sentenced to death.

1172
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:53,684
(Gasps)

1173
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:54,985
Oh, my God!

1174
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:56,585
That little weakling.

1175
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:00,355
Laurie: Mom!

1176
00:57:00,357 --> 00:57:02,256
Escobedo: Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Don't get upset yet.

1177
00:57:02,258 --> 00:57:04,258
Not get upset?

1178
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,959
Let the man speak, damn it.

1179
00:57:05,961 --> 00:57:07,360
There are remedies here.

1180
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:08,794
This is a civilized country.

1181
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:10,262
Surely there's
going to be a trial,

1182
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:11,529
some sort of hearing.

1183
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,397
Of course.
When my partner arrives,

1184
00:57:13,399 --> 00:57:15,265
we will formulate our strategy.

1185
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:17,100
Until then, try to relax.

1186
00:57:17,102 --> 00:57:18,734
It's a beautiful day.

1187
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:20,235
Enjoy Mexico.

1188
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,103
I can't believe it.

1189
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,338
Things get a little rough,
he cracks.

1190
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,173
Nana, they tortured him.

1191
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:28,475
What? A little castor oil
down his gullet?

1192
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:29,676
Oh!

1193
00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:31,844
A little electricity
on his dillywacker?

1194
00:57:31,846 --> 00:57:33,412
(Groans)

1195
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:34,646
Cat piss.

1196
00:57:40,486 --> 00:57:42,219
(Glass crunching)

1197
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:47,990
Whew! I am spent.

1198
00:57:50,794 --> 00:57:53,327
Chopping off heads just
takes it out of you, huh?

1199
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,065
Ernie: Shit!

1200
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:01,867
Time to go.
I got four heads.
I'm screwed.

1201
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:04,369
But you got a good start.

1202
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:07,672
I'm sure one of those
heads in there will do
for the one Charlie lost.

1203
00:58:07,674 --> 00:58:09,740
I doubt it,
the way my luck's
running today, kid.

1204
00:58:10,943 --> 00:58:12,542
Well, let's take a second

1205
00:58:12,544 --> 00:58:15,344
and take stock
of where we are so far.

1206
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:17,546
Let me tell you
something, kid, okay?

1207
00:58:17,548 --> 00:58:19,114
Just so you know.

1208
00:58:19,116 --> 00:58:20,548
I gotta kill the both of you,

1209
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,449
so don't think by helping me,

1210
00:58:22,451 --> 00:58:24,017
it's gonna change
that, all right?

1211
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:25,351
Yeah, I know. I sure.

1212
00:58:25,353 --> 00:58:27,786
I'm just saying that
you're doing all right.

1213
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:29,287
You might be better off
than you think.

1214
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:31,188
Okay, but I'm just saying, too,

1215
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,722
I want you to know.

1216
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:35,056
Okay, let's see.

1217
00:58:35,058 --> 00:58:37,925
I got a Hugo, a Marty,

1218
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:40,560
a so-so stu,
and a bad Frank.

1219
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:41,894
Right. And then
at the morgue,

1220
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:43,662
you said something
about little Joey.

1221
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:46,531
Right. All right,
so I got little Joey,

1222
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:49,200
a Hugo, a Marty,
and a bad Frank.

1223
00:58:49,202 --> 00:58:50,367
Now, where's stu?

1224
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:52,369
I said stu. So-so stu.

1225
00:58:52,371 --> 00:58:54,337
No. Just a second ago,
you said little Joey.

1226
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:55,905
I know I said little Joey,

1227
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,273
but I also said stu.

1228
00:58:57,275 --> 00:58:58,807
Right. But then
where's Frank?

1229
00:58:59,943 --> 00:59:01,409
All right.
Look, start over.

1230
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:03,110
You got a Hugo...
Yeah.

1231
00:59:03,112 --> 00:59:04,945
A little Joey...
Yeah.

1232
00:59:04,947 --> 00:59:06,446
A Frank...
Yeah.

1233
00:59:06,448 --> 00:59:10,382
A bad stu...
No. Frank. Bad Frank.

1234
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,016
That's what I said.

1235
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:14,184
No, you didn't.
You said bad stu.
Stu was just so-so.

1236
00:59:14,186 --> 00:59:16,519
No, sir.
I said a so-so stu.

1237
00:59:16,521 --> 00:59:17,853
You did not.
You said bad stu.

1238
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,554
Yes, I did.
Everyone heard.

1239
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,156
I said a so-so stu.

1240
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:22,624
You said bad stu.

1241
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:24,292
I know the names,
and you don't!

1242
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:27,361
You two stop it, damn it!

1243
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:32,632
These are not baseball cards
we're talking about here,

1244
00:59:32,634 --> 00:59:33,833
all right?

1245
00:59:33,835 --> 00:59:36,869
These are heads,
human beings' heads.

1246
00:59:41,241 --> 00:59:42,773
Where were we?

1247
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:43,907
I said... okay.

1248
00:59:43,909 --> 00:59:46,476
I got a Hugo, a...
Yes.

1249
00:59:46,478 --> 00:59:48,811
Ho, ho, ho.
Wait a minute.
Just a second.

1250
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,945
Huh.

1251
00:59:52,348 --> 00:59:54,381
I can't believe
I didn't notice
this before.

1252
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:55,548
What?

1253
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,616
With some black hair
and a busted nose,

1254
00:59:57,618 --> 00:59:59,317
this kid makes a decent Frank.

1255
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:00,518
What?
Yeah.

1256
01:00:02,321 --> 01:00:04,354
I mean, I know
you're a little young,

1257
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:06,456
but with that stubble,
a couple of missing teeth...

1258
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,990
But you have a Frank.

1259
01:00:07,992 --> 01:00:09,758
I got a bad Frank.
You make a better one.

1260
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,527
But you don't even know
if you need a Frank.

1261
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:13,561
I might.

1262
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:15,095
Please, please, no.

1263
01:00:15,097 --> 01:00:17,464
Listen, please, no.
Listen, I don't want
any trouble.

1264
01:00:17,466 --> 01:00:19,299
I fly. I fly.

1265
01:00:19,301 --> 01:00:20,700
What are you, a fairy?

1266
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:23,669
No, no, no, no.
He has a pilot's license.

1267
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:25,270
You don't want to fly
a commercial airline

1268
01:00:25,272 --> 01:00:27,005
to San Diego
with all these heads.

1269
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,840
That's how you got
in this mess
in the first place.

1270
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:30,541
He can fly us.
It's smarter.

1271
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,508
Fly.

1272
01:00:32,444 --> 01:00:33,543
All right,
grab all those heads.

1273
01:00:33,545 --> 01:00:35,077
Just leave the top one.

1274
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:36,578
Ernie: Why?

1275
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,047
Because the top one
doesn't look like anybody,

1276
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:40,782
and big sep
will never buy it.
Let's go.

1277
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:43,751
Wait a minute. Wait.
Just a minute.

1278
01:00:43,753 --> 01:00:47,187
I sawed this off,
and you're not even

01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:19,679
Annette:
Are you just telling me
I just passed out?

1434
01:07:19,681 --> 01:07:21,047
No, no. Drink up.
You're a little
dehydrated.

1435
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:22,248
You're such a mother.

1436
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:25,217
All right, I'm gonna
get us packed.

1437
01:07:25,219 --> 01:07:27,152
My butt's staying right here.

1438
01:07:27,154 --> 01:07:29,254
Why? I hear
the tropicana's
wonderful.

1439
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:31,489
It's a waste of money, honey.

1440
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:34,625
Give me the 2 cs.
A cot and a crapper,
I'm set.

1441
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:36,326
(Knock on door) But...

1442
01:07:36,328 --> 01:07:37,894
Ernie: Laurie,
Charlie, it's Ernie.

1443
01:07:37,896 --> 01:07:39,028
Jesus.

1444
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:41,063
Who's Ernie?
(Whispers) Nobody, grandma.

1445
01:07:41,065 --> 01:07:42,931
Well, he sure as hell
seems to know you.

1446
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,500
No, grandma.
Is this some guy
boffing on the side?

1447
01:07:45,502 --> 01:07:46,667
Grandma!

1448
01:07:46,669 --> 01:07:49,002
What the hell
are you doing,
honey?

1449
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:51,037
Where's Charlie?

1450
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,271
Who are you?

1451
01:07:52,273 --> 01:07:53,405
I asked you a question.

1452
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,340
Where the fuck is Charlie?

1453
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:56,574
And I asked you a question.

1454
01:07:56,576 --> 01:07:58,375
Who the fuck are you?

1455
01:08:01,213 --> 01:08:04,480
Well, now that we're in
this friggin' LA purisima,
what do we do now?

1456
01:08:04,482 --> 01:08:07,949
We find the cop station,
and we get our heads.

1457
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:09,817
All right.

1458
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,186
Benny, look, look.
It's him. It's him.
It's Tommy.

1459
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,054
Tommy: Come on.
All of you, get in there.

1460
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:15,522
What do you think he's doing?

1461
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,423
Think he got the heads
back already or what?

1462
01:08:17,425 --> 01:08:20,426
I don't know,
but why don't we follow him?
Come on.

1463
01:08:38,278 --> 01:08:40,144
Rico: Where the hell's
he going, huh?

1464
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:42,045
Keep following him.

1465
01:08:43,148 --> 01:08:45,381
Tommy:
I told Charlie to stay put.

1466
01:08:45,383 --> 01:08:47,783
I told that
little son of a bitch
to stay put.

1467
01:08:47,785 --> 01:08:51,319
So, who are you? God?
Why the hell
should he listen to you?

1468
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:53,554
I am so groggy.

1469
01:08:53,556 --> 01:08:56,290
Ugh! Do you mind
if I lie down
in the back?

1470
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:58,725
I don't give a shit
what you do, lady.
Just keep quiet.

1471
01:08:58,727 --> 01:09:00,460
Watch your language.

1472
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:03,829
Ow! Fern, stop it!

1473
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:04,763
(Grunts)

1474
01:09:14,674 --> 01:09:16,707
Oh, my God!

1475
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:17,774
(Screaming)

1476
01:09:19,644 --> 01:09:21,110
Another head!

1477
01:09:21,112 --> 01:09:22,811
Oh, my God!

1478
01:09:22,813 --> 01:09:26,581
Help! Help!
Lady, lady, shut up!

1479
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,015
I can't stand it!

1480
01:09:28,017 --> 01:09:29,549
I'm losing my mind!

1481
01:09:29,551 --> 01:09:31,651
Everywhere I look,
there are heads!

1482
01:09:31,653 --> 01:09:33,085
(Screaming)

1483
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:34,286
Shut up, lady!

1484
01:09:34,288 --> 01:09:36,021
Jesus Christ!

1485
01:09:36,023 --> 01:09:39,290
You're not the only person
on the planet with problems,
okay? Shut it!

1486
01:09:40,293 --> 01:09:41,925
Jesus! What a head case!

1487
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,193
Is that supposed to be a joke?

1488
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:45,527
Killer humor?

1489
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,396
Looked like this guy
I dated in high school,

1490
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:51,865
this Hugo, Hugo porto.

1491
01:09:58,105 --> 01:09:59,671
Hey, I think
we better pull over,

1492
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:01,773
'cause we need some gas soon.

1493
01:10:01,775 --> 01:10:03,508
Keep fuckin' driving.
Okay.

1494
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,976
Didn't I tell you
to watch your
fuckin' language?

1495
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:09,612
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1496
01:10:10,615 --> 01:10:12,648
Get your hands
off me, you goon.

1497
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,349
Don't fuck with me...

1498
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:16,117
Grandma!

1499
01:10:19,755 --> 01:10:20,653
Oh!

1500
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,958
My money says
he ain't got the heads.

1501
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,359
Mine, too.

1502
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:29,694
Whoa, man.
How could you do that?

1503
01:10:29,696 --> 01:10:31,762
How could I what?
Throw her off the cliff.

1504
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:34,630
A man can only take
so much, kid.

1505
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:38,066
Oh, my God.

1506
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,702
I can't believe this.

1507
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,403
I can't believe it.

1508
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:47,440
I thought the old battle-ax
would never die.

1509
01:10:47,442 --> 01:10:48,441
Mom.

1510

(Steve laughing)

1511
01:10:59,553 --> 01:11:00,652
He...

1512
01:11:09,028 --> 01:11:11,261
So what do you wanna do now?

1513
01:11:11,263 --> 01:11:13,424
Keep following them.
But I don't like
the smell of this.

1514
01:11:16,668 --> 01:11:18,134
(Tires squeal)

(Laughing)

1516
01:11:24,441 --> 01:11:26,474
Well, well, well,

1517
01:11:26,476 --> 01:11:28,309
if it isn't our old <i> amigo.</i>

1518
01:11:28,311 --> 01:11:29,776
No, not again.

1519
01:11:31,813 --> 01:11:33,679
Isn't once enough?

1520
01:11:33,681 --> 01:11:35,580
Can't you give a guy a break?

1521
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:37,548
One human being
to another. Come on.

1522
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:40,017
That's very moving, gringo,

1523
01:11:40,019 --> 01:11:41,885
but the real question is,

1524
01:11:41,887 --> 01:11:44,721
are we going to
cut off your <i> cohonies</i>
or leave them on?

1525
01:11:44,723 --> 01:11:46,022
Whoa. You don't
have to do this.

1526
01:11:46,024 --> 01:11:47,556
Come on, guys.
Come on.

1527
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:49,824
(Stammers)
Can't we flip for it?

1528
01:11:51,627 --> 01:11:54,027
What?
A coin, you know?
Flip a coin.

1529
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:55,395
I win, you let me go.

1530
01:11:55,397 --> 01:11:57,630
You win, you mangle me.

1531
01:12:04,838 --> 01:12:06,537
You're a crazy man, gringo.

1532
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:15,545
Call it.
Heads.

1533
01:12:15,547 --> 01:12:17,380
Whoa. You sure?

1534
01:12:17,382 --> 01:12:18,914
You don't even want
to think about it?

1535
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:21,883
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

What? What is it?

1593
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:12,710
Shit. I'm dead.

1594
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:15,279
Well, whoever they are,
it doesn't look like
they're coming after us.

1595
01:15:15,281 --> 01:15:16,980
Not yet.

1596
01:15:16,982 --> 01:15:19,615
Just the fact that
they're here means
I'm dead, though.

1597
01:15:19,617 --> 01:15:21,883
When? As soon as I
give you the heads?

1598
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:24,986
Or as soon as I get them
across to the states.

1599
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:27,621
Knowing them, they're gonna
let me take that risk, too.

1600
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,356
Who are the heads, anyway?

1601
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:31,590
What?

1602
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:34,459
None of your business.
What the hell do you care?

1603
01:15:34,461 --> 01:15:36,093
You spend your vacation
with a bunch of heads,

1604
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:38,628
you kind of want
to know, you know?

1605
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:41,263
You think
about their hopes
and their dreams,

1606
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:43,698
their lives cut short.

1607
01:15:44,701 --> 01:15:46,567
Hopes, dreams.

1608
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:47,935
Those bums.

1609
01:15:47,937 --> 01:15:49,403
You have to feel something.

1610
01:15:49,405 --> 01:15:50,637
You don't just
kill eight people

1611
01:15:50,639 --> 01:15:52,038
and not feel anything.

1612
01:15:53,741 --> 01:15:55,574
Look, it don't really matter,

1613
01:15:55,576 --> 01:15:58,143
but let's just set
the record straight, okay?

1614
01:15:58,145 --> 01:16:00,778
First of all,
I didn't whack 'em.
Those guys did.

1615
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,080
Second,
Mr. phi beta craphead,

1616
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:06,182
if I hadn't fucked up,
I'd be retiring after this.

1617
01:16:08,686 --> 01:16:10,152
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, look.

1618
01:16:14,023 --> 01:16:15,489
What the hell's he doing?

1619
01:16:15,491 --> 01:16:17,332
It looks like
he's chasing
aunt philomena's dog.

1620
01:16:19,727 --> 01:16:21,593
Hey, what if we can help
each other out here?

1621
01:16:21,595 --> 01:16:23,294
Impossible.
Why?

1622
01:16:23,296 --> 01:16:25,129
Because you're too stupid,

1623
01:16:25,131 --> 01:16:26,563
and, besides, I'm not
gonna take the chance

1624
01:16:26,565 --> 01:16:28,364
of going across that border.

1625
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:29,832
Well, if you know it all,

1626
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:31,667
then how come
you're in this mess
to begin with?

1627
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:33,068
Because of bad luck.

1628
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:36,337
It's not my fault that
the bag was too big
to go in carry-on.

1629
01:16:36,339 --> 01:16:39,273
There was a gift shop
right next to the gate.

1630
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:41,041
Didn't you ever
think of taking
two bags?

1631
01:16:42,177 --> 01:16:43,476
Oh, shit.

1632
01:16:48,181 --> 01:16:50,247
So I'll repeat the question.

1633
01:16:50,249 --> 01:16:53,682
What if there were
a way we could help
each other out here?

1634
01:16:53,684 --> 01:16:54,849
What way?

1635
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:10,597
I'm not into mass murder if
I'm not getting paid for it,

1636
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:14,567
but I'm warning you,
anybody gets in my way
is dead.

1637
01:17:14,569 --> 01:17:16,468
Thank you again for
getting rid of fern.

1638
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,936
Mom!

1639
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:21,039
The going rate is five thou,
but you could owe me, lady.

1640
01:17:31,817 --> 01:17:33,516
Where the hell's he going?

1641
01:17:33,518 --> 01:17:35,918
I don't know. Do I look
like a mind reader?
Come on! Let's go!

1642
01:17:37,221 --> 01:17:39,387
So now what do we do?
Drive for the border?

1643
01:17:39,389 --> 01:17:42,088
Hell, no. We gotta
get those heads back
and save your dad.

1644
01:17:42,957 --> 01:17:44,389
Hey!

1645
01:17:44,391 --> 01:17:46,090
Come back here!

1646
01:17:46,092 --> 01:17:47,791
I'll kick your ass!

1647
01:18:15,286 --> 01:18:16,551
Rico: Come on, Benny.
Let's take him now.

1648
01:18:16,553 --> 01:18:19,353
Benny: I expect that's
exactly what he wants.

1649
01:18:21,023 --> 01:18:23,623
Oh, let's see
how lucky we got here.

1650
01:18:25,226 --> 01:18:26,992
Well, we got Marty.

1651
01:18:31,564 --> 01:18:33,330
We got Benito.

1652
01:18:37,502 --> 01:18:39,034
(Laughs)

1653
01:18:39,036 --> 01:18:40,368
Little Joey.

1654
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:43,771
What is he doing?

1655
01:18:43,773 --> 01:18:44,872
I don't know.
It's like
he's teasing us.

1656
01:18:44,874 --> 01:18:46,807
Wait a minute.
It's caught on my neck.

1657
01:18:48,644 --> 01:18:51,110
Ouch. Jamal,
you wanna bite, huh?

1658
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,046
Jamal, Jamal.

1659
01:18:55,048 --> 01:18:57,448
Let's see. What do I need?

1660
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:59,183
I need a stu,

1661
01:18:59,185 --> 01:19:00,817
Frank, and a Hugo.

1662
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:08,924
There's Hugo.

1663
01:19:08,926 --> 01:19:11,192
Who is it?
I can't tell. It looks
like stu or Hugo.

1664
01:19:12,495 --> 01:19:13,927
Frankie.

1665
01:19:13,929 --> 01:19:15,028
You suck.

1666
01:19:15,897 --> 01:19:17,162
(Groans)

1667
01:19:17,164 --> 01:19:19,497
But you're gonna
have to do, buddy.

1668
01:19:19,499 --> 01:19:20,764
Rico: How many
has he got now?

1669
01:19:20,766 --> 01:19:22,799
He's got one...

1670
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:24,700
Seven, eight.
He's got all eight.

1671
01:19:24,702 --> 01:19:26,168
I want to make him
the ninth head.

1672
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:27,369
You...

1673
01:19:28,839 --> 01:19:30,905
You, I definitely don't need.

1674
01:19:32,775 --> 01:19:34,708
What a bunch of douche bags.

1675
01:19:37,512 --> 01:19:38,911
The lost dreams.

1676
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,412
What a crock.

1677
01:19:45,284 --> 01:19:48,518
Hey, this coyote
won't be doing
any more running away.

1678
01:19:49,153 --> 01:19:50,919
I got him trained.

1679
01:19:56,826 --> 01:19:58,158
(Mimics coyote howling)

1680
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:01,128
(Coyote howls)

1681
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,764
(Coyotes barking)

1682
01:20:09,102 --> 01:20:10,534
Oh.

1683
01:20:10,536 --> 01:20:13,403
Oh! That is disgusting.

1684
01:20:13,405 --> 01:20:15,772
I can't leave it outside
for the coyotes.

1685
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:17,774
All right.

1686
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:20,409
Everybody be still.
This is the last match.

1687
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:25,347
(Coughs)

1688
01:20:25,349 --> 01:20:28,483
Ernie: Good work, Steve.
You ass.

1689
01:20:28,485 --> 01:20:31,285
That's it.
Just gonna have to
wait till dawn.

1690
01:20:38,093 --> 01:20:39,625
(Steve chuckling)

1691
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:41,093
Steve, shut up.

1692
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:43,728
Heads up!

1693
01:20:44,263 --> 01:20:45,729
Stop ahead.

1694
01:20:45,731 --> 01:20:47,230
Anybody need to use the head?

1695
01:20:51,402 --> 01:20:53,368
Steve, shut up and go to sleep.

1696
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,570
Don't let it
go to your head.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1697
01:20:55,572 --> 01:20:57,638
You're way ahead of me.

1698
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,172
Steve!

1699
01:20:59,174 --> 01:21:01,574
Hey, don't bite
my head off, all right?

1700
01:21:03,444 --> 01:21:06,044
That's it. I'm sleeping
outside, guys.
Annette: Me, too.

1701
01:21:06,046 --> 01:21:08,479
Steve. Get a grip.

1702
01:21:09,248 --> 01:21:10,347
Go to sleep.

1703
01:21:10,349 --> 01:21:11,981
Or what, huh?

1704
01:21:11,983 --> 01:21:13,782
You'll have my head?

1705
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:16,885
Enough.

1706
01:21:25,728 --> 01:21:26,960

Can I get some breakfast here?

<i>Si, senor.</i> Please sit
anywhere you'd like.

he doing?

I don't know.
Let's go find out,
shall we?

1741
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:34,032
Coffee, <i> senor?</i>

1742
01:23:34,034 --> 01:23:35,566
Yeah.

1743
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:37,134
Juice?
Sure.

1744
01:23:54,019 --> 01:23:56,452
Wow. Look at this surprise.

1745
01:23:56,454 --> 01:23:58,320
Benny, Rico.

1746
01:23:58,322 --> 01:24:00,555
You boys decide
to take a vacation?

1747
01:24:00,557 --> 01:24:03,291
Yeah, Tommy.
You know,
we never seen Mexico.

1748
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:05,760
We kind of figured
this would be a good time
to check it out, you know.

1749
01:24:05,762 --> 01:24:08,896
Good, good.
It's nice down here.

1750
01:24:08,898 --> 01:24:11,932
Look, I know you're waiting
for me to cross
over to the states.

1751
01:24:11,934 --> 01:24:13,366
I gotta tell you now.

1752
01:24:13,368 --> 01:24:16,736
When I do, you get that bag

1753
01:24:16,738 --> 01:24:18,771
over my dead body.

1754
01:24:18,773 --> 01:24:22,107
Funny. We was thinking
that exact same thing,
huh, Rico?

1755
01:24:22,109 --> 01:24:23,041
Yeah.

1756
01:24:28,548 --> 01:24:30,381
That's his van.

1757
01:24:30,383 --> 01:24:32,816
(Speaking Spanish)

1758
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,718
Hey! The guy
with the van,
where is he?

1759
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,619
He's in the hotel, <i> senor.</i>

1760
01:24:37,621 --> 01:24:39,487
You're not going
in there after him,
are you?

1761
01:24:39,489 --> 01:24:40,654
We need those heads.

1762
01:24:40,656 --> 01:24:43,256
Yes, I'm going in there.

1763
01:24:43,258 --> 01:24:45,191
I can't believe
you're actually doing this.

1764
01:25:06,713 --> 01:25:08,713
Charlie:
Give me your guns.

1765
01:25:08,715 --> 01:25:10,581
Jesus, Charlie,
where'd you get that?

1766
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:11,949
Looks like mine's.

1767
01:25:11,951 --> 01:25:13,684
It was yours.
You dropped it
in the desert.

1768
01:25:13,686 --> 01:25:15,352
Now it's mine.

1769
01:25:15,354 --> 01:25:17,387
Now both of you
put your guns
on the table,

1770
01:25:17,389 --> 01:25:19,354
or I'm gonna
blow your heads off.

1771
01:25:20,924 --> 01:25:22,189
Right now!

1772
01:25:27,528 --> 01:25:29,227
Laurie, get the guns.

1773
01:25:32,732 --> 01:25:34,331
Ernie, get the duffel bag.

1774
01:25:34,333 --> 01:25:36,800
Wait a minute.
Easy, kid. You don't want
to mess with these guys.

1775
01:25:36,802 --> 01:25:40,136
He's right, Charlie.
What do you want
those heads for, anyway?

1776
01:25:40,138 --> 01:25:41,670
He's gonna take them
to the border

1777
01:25:41,672 --> 01:25:43,304
and turn them in,
right, Charlie?

1778
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:44,705
He'll be a hero
with her old man.

1779
01:25:44,707 --> 01:25:45,839
Something like that.

1780
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:47,240
Forget about it.

1781
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:50,008
You do that,
and big sep kills us all.

1782
01:25:51,644 --> 01:25:53,043
Fuck big sep.

1783
01:25:56,981 --> 01:25:59,348
Miss Bennett, <i>senor</i> pritchett.

1784

Paco.

1785
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:06,119
We're FBI.

1786
01:26:06,921 --> 01:26:08,753
He's the unabellman.

1787
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:12,622
(Yells)

1788
01:26:12,624 --> 01:26:14,056
<i>Senora</i> Bennett.

1789
01:26:17,927 --> 01:26:19,293
Back off.

1790
01:26:23,064 --> 01:26:24,663
Come on!

1791
01:26:24,665 --> 01:26:25,830
Rico: He's getting away.
Big sep's gonna
kill us, Benny.

1792
01:26:25,832 --> 01:26:27,231
Come on! Let's go!

1793
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:30,066
Come on, Laurie.
Drive faster.

1794
01:26:30,068 --> 01:26:31,801
Why do you have a gun?

1795
01:26:31,803 --> 01:26:34,069
Laurie, why do
you have a gun?
What? What?

1796
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:36,237
What's happening?
What's this all about?

1797
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:37,938
It's about heads.

1798
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:39,606
Ernie: Hey, Steve,
leave him alone.

1799
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:41,307
(Speaking Spanish)

1800
01:26:41,309 --> 01:26:43,542

1803
01:26:50,349 --> 01:26:52,315
I told you
it wasn't recyclable.

1804
01:26:52,317 --> 01:26:54,817
Paco, it's okay.
It's okay, paco. <i> Si.</i>

1805
01:27:03,727 --> 01:27:05,860
Charlie, what are we gonna do?

1806
01:27:05,862 --> 01:27:07,361
Charlie?

1807
01:27:07,363 --> 01:27:09,295
What are you doing?
Ernie, give me
the duffel bag.

1808
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:13,631
Everybody stay in the car.

1809
01:27:13,633 --> 01:27:15,599

01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:27,675
Hey, does this mean anything
to anybody?

1814
01:27:27,677 --> 01:27:29,610
(All screaming)

1815
01:27:29,612 --> 01:27:31,278
I have something to declare.

1816
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,747
Hey, hey, hey.
It's a mistake.

1817
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:34,881
He doesn't have anything.

1818
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:37,517
Arrest them!
Arrest them!

1819
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:39,852
That's his bag.
Arrest them.

1820
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:41,186
(All screaming)

1821
01:27:41,188 --> 01:27:42,420

1822
01:27:42,422 --> 01:27:44,655
All right!
Everybody freeze.

1823
01:27:44,657 --> 01:27:46,056
Don't do anything stupid,

1824
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:47,490
and nothing stupid will happen.

1825
01:27:47,492 --> 01:27:49,492
Get to the plane.
Oh, shit.

1827
01:27:53,698 --> 01:27:55,597
No need to be excited.

1828
01:27:55,599 --> 01:27:57,865
We're just...
We're gonna get in the plane

and fly away. Bye-bye.

Have a nice day.

1831
01:28:02,837 --> 01:28:04,169
Arrest them!

1832
01:28:04,171 --> 01:28:05,370
Drop your guns,
or I'm gonna shoot him.

1833
01:28:05,372 --> 01:28:07,105
Move in, God damn it!
Move in!

1834
01:28:07,107 --> 01:28:08,706
No!

1835
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:11,041
(Clicking)
Laurie: Charlie, no!

1836
01:28:12,244 --> 01:28:13,443
Arrest them!

1837
01:28:13,445 --> 01:28:15,378
Check their bag.
Open the bag.

1838
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:16,645
(Stutters) There's...

1839
01:28:16,647 --> 01:28:17,979
There's a human head
in the bag.

1840
01:28:24,587 --> 01:28:26,486
The man you arrested
yesterday is in jail

1841
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:28,087
for the murders
these guys committed.

1842
01:28:28,089 --> 01:28:29,955
Her father's innocent.

1843
01:28:29,957 --> 01:28:31,956
These are the guys that did it.

1844
01:28:33,592 --> 01:28:34,924
Right there.

1845
01:28:35,259 --> 01:28:36,625
Oh!

1846
01:28:36,627 --> 01:28:38,393
(Stuttering)
Wait a minute.
That's not ours.

1847
01:28:38,395 --> 01:28:40,461
You arrested us for
the wrong head here.
Rico!

1848
01:28:40,463 --> 01:28:42,229
All our heads had hair.
Shut up.

1849
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:44,731
Where are our heads, asshole?
Shut up, Rico!

1850
01:28:44,733 --> 01:28:45,965
I said shut up.

1851
01:28:45,967 --> 01:28:47,933
I told you.
They set us up, Benny.

1852

(Security officer
ordering in Spanish)

1853
01:29:03,682 --> 01:29:05,314
You knew it?
You planned it?

1854
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,530
You got a future, kid.

1855
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,032
Thanks.

1856
01:29:46,154 --> 01:29:48,521
Sleight of bag
by Charlie pritchett.

1857
01:29:54,562 --> 01:29:56,862
Show me the law about bringing
a head out of the country!

1858
01:29:56,864 --> 01:29:58,163
Shut up, Rico!

1859
01:29:58,165 --> 01:29:59,931
It ain't a fruit,
it ain't a vegetable!

1860
01:29:59,933 --> 01:30:02,333
It ain't a native plant,
