1
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,031
Die, scumbags

2
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:37,755
You know, you're late, Tommy

3
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:39,545
Rico, relax

4
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:42,754
Okay, then, okay,
you're the boss, come on

5
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:44,595
That's Hugo Porto's mob, huh?

6
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:47,724
He tried to move in on Big
Sep's territory down in Atlantic City

7
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:50,394
Killed Victor Viking's
mom in the process

8
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:52,353
Wow, what a bunch of scumbags, huh?

9
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:56,433
Whatever, and there's proof for Big
Sep, you got a ticket on the red-eye

10
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:58,941
The heads are nice and
clean and ready to go, okay?

11
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,311
Okay

12
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:02,694
Tommy, Big Sep's hot

13
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:05,151
I'm two weeks
late delivering the meat

14
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:07,902
If he doesn't get that by noon
tomorrow, more heads are gonna roll

15
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:10,031
- You know what I mean?
- No problem

16
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,621
Do you love me?

17
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,150
- Where you headed? San Diego?
- Mexico

18
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,527
- You have a good flight
- Thanks a lot

19
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:50,067
Do you love me? Do you love me?

20
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,908
Do you love me? Do you love me?

21
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,706
How you doing?

22
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,215
Thank you, thanks

23
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,694
Step over here please

24
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:36,732
Gun! She's got a gun!

25
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,162
I don't even own a gun!

26
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,719
- Hey, kid, is this yours?
- Yeah

27
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:10,599
Do me a favor, will you?
Put that right under the seat

28
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,678
And see maybe if you
can keep that right near you

29
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,559
I got some
important stuff in this bag

30
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:17,478
I'd like to keep it close by
me, you know what I mean?

31
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:22,818
Thanks, that's really nice of you

32
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:27,117
- Good kid, thank you
- Okay

33
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:33,037
Atta boy, fits right under there

34
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:35,417
No, it doesn't fit right under there

35
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:38,496
Maybe you can get a spot in
another bin, thanks, I appreciate that

36
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,087
It's nice of you

37
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:04,943
Excuse me

38
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:06,944
Careful, careful

39
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:13,654
I almost didn't make it

40
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:15,824
Well, I'm sure that
someone is glad you did

41
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:18,203
Let's see, 49C, right down this way

42
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:19,781
Thanks

43
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:35,090
- Excuse me, sir, is this yours?
- Yeah

44
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,511
I'm sorry, we'll need
to use this compartment

45
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,259
Would you mind using another one?

46
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,971
Because I have
valuable family heirlooms in there

47
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:45,771
Sir, as you can plainly see,
this is an emergency situation

48
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:47,691
Well, maybe you can
use somebody else's bin

49
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,098
I mean, this kid's not using all of his

50
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,400
Would you mind if
they used some of yours?

51
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,071
Hey, excuse me, but screw you

52
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,109
Hey, hey, come on,
be nice, be a gentleman, will you?

53
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,448
We're trying to help over here,
here, let me help you

54
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,279
This goes right
over here, it's small

55
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,698
That's okay, thanks, don't... don't?

56
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,288
Wait! Wait! Don't kick it!

57
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:06,657
For God's sake,
those are live human organs!

58
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:09,327
Trust me, pal, they don't feel it

59
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,876
Would you sit down please?

60
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,126
Sir, I'm really sorry about that

61
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:19,507
- Sir, we're gonna have to use your bin
- Excuse me? but?

62
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:22,217
And actually, sir, I think
your bag is over the size limit

63
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:26,265
Well, no, because see, the guy outside
measured this and he said that it was okay

64
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:29,517
Sir, it's clearly over the size
limit, it will have to go in cargo

65
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,397
Listen, wait a minute, wait a minute?

66
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:33,645
Hold on, hold on a second, listen

67
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:38,314
Maybe we could just leave
my bag where it is, all right?

68
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,355
Are you trying to bribe me, sir?

69
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,984
No. I'm trying to purchase
a place for my bag, which I already...

70
00:06:43,024 --> 00:06:45,284
The place for your bag is in cargo, sir

71
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,953
Excuse me, maybe
I'll just take another flight

72
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:51,074
Fine, the next flight to
San Diego leaves in seven hours, sir

73
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:52,453
All right, let me make a phone call

74
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:56,502
Sir, do you actually think that we're gonna
hold the plane while you use the phone

75
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,583
Now, are you flying with us tonight or not?

76
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,253
- All right, Miss Burke?
- Yes

77
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:03,843
- That's your name, right?
- Yes

78
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:07,012
This bag better be in San Diego,
you'll be in a lot of trouble if it's not

79
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,091
Yes, sir, it will be the very first off the plane

80
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:10,760
Does that make you happy?

81
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:12,802
- When it's there, then I'll be happy
- Okay

82
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,812
Have a seat, sir, thank you

83
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:21,851
Happy? Yeah, I'm happy, I'm thrilled

84
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,061
Happy

85
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,610
What are you looking at?

86
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,988
You started all this with those friggin' organs

87
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,110
You're happy, right?
Happy, who's happy?

88
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,418
Look, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, I'm Charlie

89
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:52,838
So, where you headed?

90
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:55,847
I'm gonna meet my girlfriend's parents

91
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,726
She races these cars

92
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:04,936
She's great, she's great!

93
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,684
I wish her parents thought the same of me,
I'm on my way to meet them for the first time

94
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:11,355
I haven't seen her in like six months, and...

95
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:12,565
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go to sleep

96
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:14,445
Think about what
you're gonna say to them, okay?

97
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:16,574
Yeah, I don't know, because
I mean I haven't even met them

98
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:19,365
Already the father,
he doesn't like me, I know

99
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:22,075
I could understand that,
I just met you and I don't like you either

100
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,325
I got to sleep, didn't
you hear me? Come on

101
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,583
I'm just trying to make conversation, but...

102
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:28,413
Good, make it in sign language

103
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:44,803
Laurie?

104
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:52,310
- Something wrong?
- No

105
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,812
- You look great
- Thanks

106
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:00,610
- What is the matter?
- Nothing, let's talk about it later

107
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,699
Okay

108
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:38,187
Oh, no. No, Jesus, please, no!

109
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:45,196
Charlie Pritchett! Shit!

110
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,654
What do you have in there?
It looks like you packed for a month

111
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:50,986
You know me, ready for anything

112
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:55,653
- Oh, boy, look at this loser
- Honey! Be nice now, come on

113
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:58,825
Charlie, these are my parents,
Annette and Dick

114
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,375
- Annette
- Charlie, it's a real pleasure

115
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:05,215
Dick, very nice to meet you, this is for you

116
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:08,673
Oh, these wrappings
are beautiful, thank you

117
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:11,633
Oh, my God! Dick, I left yours on the plane...

118
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,342
No, no, no, why don't you call the airlines?

119
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:15,473
We got a long ride,
we've got to make tracks

120
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:16,631
Sorry

121
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:19,141
Woodgy, why don't
you ride shotgun with your dad?

122
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:23,183
Wudji? Wudji like me to drive?

123
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:28,401
I think I can handle it

124
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:35,192
No... no... Jesus

125
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,999
House of pain

126
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,919
- Yeah, hello, who's this?
- This is Qaddafi, who's this?

127
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:59,338
Qaddafi, huh? Listen, this is Bill,
I'm an old friend of Charlie Pritchett's

128
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:02,179
I was wondering
if you could help me find him

129
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:04,718
Yeah, he's gone on spring
break with the rest of America

130
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:08,187
- Did you try looking in Mexico?
- That's very funny

131
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,477
Look, this is really important

132
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:12,896
You think you could be
a little more specific, Qaddafi?

133
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:14,977
Not unless it's for a grade

134
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:18,065
Hey, Bill, is it? Tell me if
this sounds like a phone hanging up

135
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:22,065
Yeah! Shit! Shit!

136
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:30,417
I need a flight to Bethesda University

137
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:34,165
I'm not sure the University
has their own airport

138
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:36,756
But we can fly you to Baltimore, will that do?

139
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,835
Hey, don't get cute with me, asshole, huh?

140
00:11:57,563 --> 00:12:00,143
Wake up, people, we're here!
Made it in record time

141
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:04,110
- I'm famished
- Oh, me too

142
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:06,982
Boy, could I use a Margarita, what time is it?

143
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:09,451
Thirteen fifty hours

144
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:13,031
Bear, remember what
we agreed about your drinking?

145
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:16,369
You be a good bear,
take one of your new pills

146
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:18,161
They make me woozy, Wooly

147
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,998
Besides, I said I could use a drink,
I didn't say I'm having one

148
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,538
Listen, there is absolutely
nothing in this whole world

149
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,549
That could ever, ever make
me take a drink again

150
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,589
So, relax, okay?

151
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:35,428
- Bienvenidos! Welcome back, senior
- Hola, Juan

152
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,097
Hope you catch some big ones this time

153
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:43,478
Gracias, gracias

154
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,728
- Manny, I ran into a little delay here
- What do you mean, a delay?

155
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:48,147
Excuse me, are you going to be long?

156
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,357
- A day, maybe two
- On the phone?

157
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,947
What? What the hell's happened, Tommy?

158
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:55,696
Manny, I can't go into it
right now but it's going to be okay

159
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:57,866
All right? I mean, can't you talk to Big Sep?

160
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:01,116
Big Sep is riding me like a
race horse, I told you if it was late...

161
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,076
Listen, the job is finished,
so what's the big deal with the delivery?

162
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,837
Tommy, you didn't lose nothing, did you?

163
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,836
Manny, you know how many
years I did this for your father?

164
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,756
How could you even ask
me something like that?

165
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:12,924
Mister?

166
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,464
Hey, lady, you interrupt me one
more time, you're gonna swallow this phone

167
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:16,633
Now get out of here

168
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:18,344
Go ahead, take it on the heels

169
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,964
One day, you got one day, Tommy

170
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,093
If big Sep doesn't get those
heads in his hands by noon tomorrow

171
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,892
You might as well chop off your own
head and put it in with the others, capish?

172
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,773
Don't worry about it, all right?
He'll have them before they start stinking

173
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:35,524
- Please or you'll be stinking
- Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean

174
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:38,323
- About time
- Yeah, I know

175
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,822
Here, it's all yours

176
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:46,910
We've done a lot of redecorating
since you've been here, senor

177
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:49,242
It's quite lovely, we hope you enjoy it

178
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:53,121
- It's beautiful
- Senor Pritchett... your room

179
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,709
Thank you

180
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,961
The mini-bar, el bano, the bathroom

181
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:01,840
If you need anything, please call me

182
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,670
Everybody unpack later

183
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,338
They're only serving lunch
downstairs for ten more minutes

184
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,260
- Yes sir, no problem
- Good

185
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,809
Pepe, venga! Pepe, venga!

186
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,479
- Come on, Bear
- I'm coming, Wooly

187
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:17,057
It's 206, room 206

188
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:26,777
Okay, Laurie, what's going on?

189
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:30,027
Not now, let' just talk about it later, okay?

190
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,786
No, let's talk about it now

191
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:40,245
Look, Charlie,
I don't know quite how to put this

192
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,416
But... I think I want a divorce

193
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:51,346
What? A divorce? We're not
even married, we're not even engaged

194
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:53,214
You know what I mean

195
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:55,345
That's why you invited me here?
To tell me this?

196
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:56,883
I thought you invited me to meet your parents

197
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:59,095
I didn't really actually invite you

198
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:03,682
Excuse me, but you
invited me to your parents' house

199
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:06,774
And then you called and said
we were coming to Mexico instead

200
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:09,732
When I said we were going to Mexico,
I didn't actually mean you

201
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,693
What?!

202
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:14,491
It was just supposed to be me
and my parents for my dad's birthday

203
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:18,703
And you got so excited;
I didn't know how to break it to you

204
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,872
Laurie, what's happened to you?

205
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,622
Six months at home and you've mutated

206
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:31,541
From a fun-loving free spirit
into... Nancy Reagan

207
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:35,420
Look, I just want stability in my life, Charlie

208
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:38,511
I need to be with someone
who really knows who they are

209
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,220
And knows what they want in life

210
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,720
You know what this is all about? Your folks

211
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,809
They don't like me, and it's
affecting the way that you feel about me

212
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,597
But just wait, Laurie

213
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:53,818
My being here will turn
out to be a blessing in disguise

214
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:58,198
I'm not giving up on you, Laurie

215
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,569
- Is my hair all right?
- I am open-minded

216
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,276
It's just that he's such a dip!

217
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,327
Do you think he's a dip?
I think he's really cute

218
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,406
And he seems funny, and he seems smart

219
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,367
I mean, what do you want for Laurie?

220
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,206
I want what I was when I was his age

221
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:16,377
- I was charismatic, ambitious...
- That's right

222
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,256
- I was clearly headed to the top
- Clearly, darling

223
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:21,006
The very, very top

224
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:26,715
I mean, we can be honest with
each other when we're alone, can't we?

225
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:28,634
Oh, I think that's a good idea, Wooly

226
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:30,556
I've always wanted to be...

227
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,645
Oh, I forgot something,
will you go down and get us a table?

228
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:35,063
- What's the problem?
- No problem, no problem

229
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,774
I just forgot something and
I'll be there in just a second

230
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:39,444
Okay? I'm running

231
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:23,863
Senorita, no, no, it's for decoration,
not for sale, sorry

232
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,372
I better go check on Bear

233
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,632
- Ah, Mrs. Bennett
- There you are, Bear

234
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,460
We ordered you an enchilada

235
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:51,602
- Bear, are you all right?
- Mrs. Bennett?

236
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,521
Jesus! Ma, are you okay?

237
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:59,110
- Would you, would you like to... to sit?
- Mom, what are you doing?

238
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,778
Good God, Bear, don't tell
me you've been drinking again

239
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,609
Now, remember what the
doctor said, take nice deep breaths

240
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:11,618
- I have some pills if you're not feeling well
- Yeah, why don't you take some?

241
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:18,536
It's, it's, it's... all right, folks

242
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:22,628
She's just a little hungry, she's
hungry and her blood sugar's dropped

243
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:25,418
Are you hungry, Bear?

244
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:30,047
- Mom, for God's sake?
- Would you like an enchilada?

245
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:38,266
It's all right, folks! No harm done

246
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,186
They're just happy to see each other

247
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:13,002
You little son of a bitch, I should have known

248
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:05,676
Wake up, Qaddafi,
we're gonna play College Bowl

249
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,476
For ten points of your life...

250
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:11,805
Hey Stevie, you got any notes
from last night? I don't need them

251
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:13,857
Hey!

252
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,105
No, no, I've got it, thank you very much

253
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,946
Seniorita, your mother is going to be fine

254
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,735
Take this please

255
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:28,036
Senor, I gave her a sedative,
it's muy, muy strong

256
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:30,405
- Let her rest, huh?
- Thank you, doctor

257
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:35,124
We've only been back here
an hour and already she's on the booze

258
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:38,292
Would you go easy on her, dad?
She's obviously under a lot of stress

259
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,373
Okay

260
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:45,003
When she wakes up, we
won't mention a thing, okay, Laurie?

261
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:50,172
Why don't you watch her, while Charlie
and I go rent a boat for tomorrow?

262
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:52,892
- Okay, Charlie?
- Yeah, great

263
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,891
Is my hair okay?

264
00:22:01,642 --> 00:22:04,651
Uh, do, do you mind if
l change my shirt before we go?

265
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:08,651
No, I'll use the phone in
your room so I don't disturb her

266
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:15,319
All right, we're gonna play
a game called Be Honest With Me?

267
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:18,201
Now, the rules are very simple

268
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,958
l ask you a question and you
have to be honest with me, okay?

269
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,588
Now, where did
Charlie Pritchett go on vacation?

270
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:30,918
Second rule, you have to answer, Qaddafi

271
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:35,338
- Why does he keep calling you Qaddafi?
- I don't know

272
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:39,968
Now, look, I don't want to have
to put you kids through hell

273
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:45,098
So let me tell you
what's going to happen here

274
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,108
First, I'm gonna hurt you,
then you're gonna try to be brave

275
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:52,816
Then I'm gonna hurt you again,
and you're gonna tell me everything

276
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:57,867
That's not being honest, that's not honest

277
00:22:58,195 --> 00:22:59,825
That's not honest!

278
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:05,495
Now, look, this is not gonna get
any easier, it's only gonna get harder

279
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:09,794
So, I don't know why you're protecting
this kid, because I'm gonna find him

280
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:13,254
There we go, atta boy

281
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:17,254
l swear to God, we don't know where he is
all he said was Mexico and he's ...

282
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:18,922
Come on!

283
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:21,173
We're not trying to protect him!

284
00:23:21,424 --> 00:23:24,053
I'm not going to repeat myself!

285
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:31,853
Mom, if you want to come down,
you're certainly welcome

286
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:33,982
It's just that the weather is terrible

287
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:37,901
Well, it's rained since we got here,
mom, there are storms everywhere

288
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:40,232
l mean more storms are on the way

289
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:42,150
Mom, I'm just thinking about you

290
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:46,450
Mom, l... we..., of course we'd
love to have your company, mom

291
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:49,780
Well, I know you're young enough
to travel, it has nothing to do with that

292
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,458
Mom... mom, please, please,
mom, please don't dredge that up

293
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,921
What's the matter? Are you okay?

294
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,209
l, uh, uh, ants, ants everywhere

295
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,418
Ants' I don't see any ants,
what are you talking about?

296
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,837
Mom, there are ants
down here, ants everywhere

297
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:10,968
Mom, please don't dredge that up

298
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:13,307
Because it's got nothing to do with her

299
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,808
What is it? What is it?

300
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,358
- I have a cramp in my leg
- A cramp?

301
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:23,148
Ay, ah!

302
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,027
Well, pull yourself together, stop screaming

303
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:27,195
I'm, I'm sorry, I'm...

304
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:29,905
No, mom, I'm not arguing with my wife,
I'm arguing with you

305
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:32,905
l mean, mom, mom, please,
I'll have to call you back

306
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:35,116
Mom, I'll call you back, I'll call you right back

307
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,155
Can you keep it down?

308
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:39,785
Now, why don't I meet you downstairs
in the lobby in say, five minutes?

309
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:40,955
- Five minutes?
- All right?

310
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:42,245
Five minutos!

311
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:45,255
And don't send this laundry out,
it's gonna cost me an arm and a leg!

312
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,423
yeah!

313
00:24:56,845 --> 00:25:01,644
Oh, yeah! Obviously, this is, this isn't real

314
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:10,102
It's a, it's, it's a fake, it's a fake

315
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:14,982
God! God!

316
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:19,201
Senor! Senor!

317
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:23,531
- Are you okay?
- I am fine

318
00:25:23,742 --> 00:25:25,952
l just, I ate a hot pepper

319
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:29,251
- Oh, ah, hot pepper
- Venga, Pepe

320
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:30,831
No, no, no

321
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,129
Charlie, are you okay?

322
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:35,549
I'm fine, I just ate a killer pepper

323
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,919
A chili pepper, I'm fine

324
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:39,879
There's some water in the mini-bar, senor

325
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:43,638
No, no, no
l like the sensation

326
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:46,889
I' yee haw! Yee haw!

327
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,059
Enchilada!

328
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:53,517
Okay, well you call me
if you need anything, eh?

329
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:56,438
- Will do, thank you, Paco
- Pepe, venga!

330
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:58,647
Pepe, come on! Pepe!

331
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:01,696
- God!
- Charlie, what's going on?

332
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:04,366
The police, this has
got to be a setup! Oh, God!

333
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:05,866
There's got to be a camera or something

334
00:26:05,907 --> 00:26:08,157
We're in Mexico, why would
there be a camera in Mexico?

335
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:10,536
Mexican Candid Camera, still on the air!

336
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:13,916
Charlie! You're acting insane!

337
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,786
- I'm okay
- Would you get it together?

338
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:17,756
- Okay?
- I'm okay

339
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,044
What the hell is going on?

340
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:24,175
Look, Laurie, you gotta
promise you won't freak, okay?

341
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:25,793
Okay

342
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:28,964
I found something in my duffel bag

343
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:35,104
Something, oh... I mean, look, it's a...

344
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:39,392
- What?
- Forget it, it's nothing, it's nothing

345
00:26:41,103 --> 00:26:44,022
- Charlie Pritchett, you're such a sneak
- No!

346
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:46,441
You got me a present,
I didn't know you got me one

347
00:26:46,484 --> 00:26:48,693
No! No! It's not a present Laurie!

348
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,653
Laurie, don't open it, it's a head

349
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,160
Laurie

350
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,202
Laurie!

351
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:01,791
Are you okay? Honey, are you all right?

352
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:03,121
Yeah

353
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,429
- Senora, are you all right?
- She's fine, everything's fine

354
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:20,220
She had a pepper too,
she loves them, actually, she'll be fine

355
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,770
Are you sure, senorita?

356
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,477
Pepe, Pepe, venga

357
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,727
Pepe, venga!

358
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,859
Pepe!

359
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:36,819
Pepe, andale! Vamos

360
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:38,828
Pepe!

361
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,497
You call me if you need anything, eh?

362
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,746
Will do, thank you, Paco, bye-bye

363
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:49,495
All right

364
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:55,085
Laurie, are you okay?
Can you stop screaming?

365
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:59,636
Good God, Charlie, what are
you doing with a head in your bag?

366
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:01,425
I don't know, you think I know?

367
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,766
Yes, I think you'd know
If I had a head in my bag, I think I'd know

368
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:09,854
Laurie, Laurie, don't get
upset but there's more than one

369
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:13,272
What? Charlie, there's two?

370
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:17,273
- No
- Three? Four? How many?

371
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:20,822
Eight?

372
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:28,531
It's those gringos, son locos

373
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:31,582
Laurie, you're not in the hall,
you're in the closet

374
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,291
Don't you think I realize that?

375
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:35,791
- Laurie
- I'm not coming out

376
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,961
- Laurie!
- I'm not!

377
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,502
- You have to come out!
- No!

378
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:43,009
The bodies are in there

379
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,549
I was... I was kidding, I was kidding

380
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:51,850
Kidding? You're kidding at a time like this?

381
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,890
Well, I had to calm you down

382
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,978
For God's sake, Laurie,
try to stay calm, okay?

383
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,099
Calm? You expect me to remain calm

384
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:00,269
When you have eight human
heads in your luggage?

385
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,488
Laurie, there may be two people
in China who didn't hear you

386
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:10,279
- Then what the hell is going on?
- I wish I knew

387
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:16,577
Could it be Steve or Ernie playing
some sort of sick, hideous, medical prank?

388
00:29:16,657 --> 00:29:19,626
I don't think so,
the thought of blood bothers Steve

389
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:21,667
And this isn't Ernie's style

390
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:26,507
They're my best friends, but
come on, they're dull guys with dull lives

391
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:29,835
You psycho! You psycho!

392
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,715
We don't know anything!

393
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:33,845
I don't know shit!

394
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,596
You're right

395
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,346
Besides, the only heads we
have access to are cadavers

396
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,804
- And these heads are fresh
- Charlie!

397
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,976
I'm sorry, but it's true,
check it out for yourself

398
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,144
No!

399
00:29:44,226 --> 00:29:47,894
- Let's call the police
- No! No! No!

400
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:51,154
- Why?
- Because we're in Mexico, Laurie

401
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:55,113
A third world country. You don't just
call the police in a third world country

402
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:57,243
And tell them you found
eight human heads in your luggage

403
00:29:57,403 --> 00:30:00,452
- Why not?
- Because they have no laws here!

404
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:04,244
- They'll turn me into a taco!
- All right, what do you suggest then?

405
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:09,250
We have to think this thing through rationally

406
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:11,790
- Okay?
- Oh, my God, Charlie

407
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:14,291
- What if they have your bag?
- What?

408
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:17,842
Your bag! What if the person
who owns this bag has your bag?

409
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:19,840
They're going to come looking for you

410
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:26,391
Laurie, I just took
a mental inventory of my bag

411
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:29,439
There's no... there's nothing in that
bag that could possibly lead them here

412
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,148
His family lives in Clarion, Vermont!
They're in the furniture business

413
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,320
Laurie is from Denver! Last name, Bennett

414
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,859
B-e-n-n-e-t-t!

415
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,449
On vacation in Mexico

416
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,488
Okay, that's reassuring
What do we do?

417
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:51,747
Simple! All we have
to do is throw them away

418
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:08,466
They lock the garbage

419
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:14,014
Senor Pritchett?

420
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:18,775
- Ah, Paco
- Can I help you?

421
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:24,734
No, no, I was just putting the,
the, the trash in the garbage

422
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,654
Putting the garbage in the trash, you know?

423
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:29,195
- I'll take it for you
- No, no, I got it

424
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:32,115
- What is it?
- It's? it's none of your business

425
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:36,164
No, Senor, I meant what kind
of garbage is it? Aluminum? Plastic?

426
00:31:36,283 --> 00:31:37,662
We recycle here

427
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:42,292
It's, it's really not recyclable,
it's, it's perishable

428
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:46,592
- Oh, well, perishables we compost
- It's really not compostable

429
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:50,460
Sure it is!
Everything perishable is compostable

430
00:31:50,672 --> 00:31:53,010
Jesus Christ!

431
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,431
I mean, come on!

432
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:59,600
I'm sorry, senor!
Go ahead and put it in

433
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:04,690
- Thank you
- I'll take care of it later

434
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:10,480
Actually, you know what? It's fine
I'll just take it back

435
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:17,368
It's really not that bad. I just need
some oil and formaldehyde and vinegar

436
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,198
And it'll be just as good as...

437
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,460
- Are you sure, senor?
- Yes, thank you, Paco

438
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:30,796
Mom, why are you bringing
my inheritance into this?

439
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:32,717
Excuse me!

440
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:35,427
You still haven't changed?
What are you doing?

441
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:37,757
- Well, l...
- No, not you, mom

442
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:41,176
I found a roa... roa... a rat in my room

443
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:43,137
And it had a ball of...

444
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,766
I don't wanna be rude, but are you coming?

445
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:48,727
Or am I going to spend the entire
day waiting in the lobby for you?

446
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:50,935
I am so sorry, I'll be right down

447
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:05,153
What am I going to do? Flush them?

448
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:10,494
Nothing fits around here

449
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:16,504
No, no, no, por favor , no clean

450
00:33:16,543 --> 00:33:19,502
No clean, room clean, no clean

451
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:22,093
- No clean
- No clean, gracias

452
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:24,922
No, I mean, I'm, I'm
asking you to come, mom

453
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:28,762
But there's really no need for you to come
Mom, it's two hundred degrees here

454
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:34,812
You go in here! Like that!

455
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:37,981
Mom, if we're cut off, it's the lightning

456
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:39,400
What?

457
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,408
Let's go rent a boat! I got 8 human heads
in my room and I gotta go rent a boat!

458
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:55,908
Okay

459
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:15,467
Mrs. Pritshett?

460
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:19,977
Hi, this is Ernie Lipscomb,
Charlie's friend from medical school

461
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:24,856
Oh! Great! Great! The number
of as many hotels as you can give me

462
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,145
No, I know, it is, it is late

463
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,945
It's just that we've run into
a little bit of a situation up here

464
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,315
All right, okay, the Mayan

465
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:35,615
- That sounds great
- No, no, no, relax, everything's fine

466
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:42,453
But I do need to get a hold of Charlie. Did
he tell you what hotel he was staying at?

467
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:48,962
He didn't...

468
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:52,793
Right, no, I know how sons can be

469
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,672
- All right, and that's the last one, right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good

470
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:59,472
- School's a little crazy
- Well, thank you

471
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:01,051
You know how that goes

472
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:03,051
You sure he's only going away for a week?

473
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:06,723
- He packed enough stuff here for a year
- Charlie is a compulsive packer

474
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,772
"Sleight of Mind" by
Charlie Pritchett again

475
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:13,152
He's writing a detective novel

476
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,901
Yeah, it sounds like
his autobiography

477
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:21,031
It's a pun on sleight on hand and dim-witted.
You know, a pun, play on words, get it?

478
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:25,910
No, no, no, relax. Everything's fine

479
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,789
No, I don't know
we got midterms

480
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:40,417
I'll talk to you soon, Mrs. Pritshett
gotta go, bye

481
00:35:44,678 --> 00:35:49,767
I popped the last guy
who tried to pun me, asshole. Get it?

482
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:55,768
Yeah, I get it too.
Make some more calls

483
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:57,266
You too, asshole

484
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:04,615
Charlie, this is none of my business,
hopefully... but, let's review

485
00:36:04,657 --> 00:36:07,656
You've been pre-law,
pre-architect, pre-vet, pre-med...

486
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:09,744
- No, I'm in Med.
- He's an intern

487
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:11,957
And now Laurie tells me you've been
thinking about becoming a head-shrinker

488
00:36:14,535 --> 00:36:17,584
- Charlie
- A... a what?

489
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,375
Shrink, headshrinker, psychoanalyst

490
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:22,874
Whatever you call an
overpaid hand-holder these days

491
00:36:23,924 --> 00:36:28,843
Actually, sir, I was thinking about that...
but I don't know what I'm doing anymore

492
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:31,174
- I'm certainly aware of that
- Dad, enough...

493
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,451
Annette?

494
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,080
Bear?

495
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,880
- Wooly, are we alone?
- Yeah, we're alone, but where are you?

496
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,669
Wooly!

497
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:15,009
- What are you doing there?
- Wooly! Thank God Thank God you're alive!

498
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:16,968
Still alive? Of course I'm still alive

499
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,389
Where's Laurie? Not with him,
oh my God! Not with that maniac!

500
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:23,637
Calm down and tell me what
you're talking about

501
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:27,437
What I'm talking about?
Our daughter is dating a mass murderer

502
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:31,227
I went into his room
to take a gift to put it in his bag

503
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:35,026
In his bag he's got body parts!

504
00:38:22,522 --> 00:38:27,401
Senora Bennett, I sorry to scare you
I was fixing the gutter

505
00:38:33,622 --> 00:38:36,711
Dick, I am not crazy!
I know what I saw!

506
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,499
- I believe you
- No, you don't believe me

507
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:41,880
Yes, I do believe you, but remember
what the doctor said about your drinking

508
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,049
- I did not hallucinate
- Bear

509
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:46,591
I had the drink after I saw them
Please, Wooly

510
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:48,049
Bear, what about the pills?

511
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:51,299
I saw you take them, you said yourself
they made you woosy

512
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:57,638
Right, but then what about the bag?
Okay... where's the bag?

513
00:38:58,188 --> 00:39:00,978
I don't know, but I was in his room
when he unpacked

514
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:03,978
He unpacked right in front of me
would a maniac do that?

515
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:19,076
Oh, no! Oh, no!

516
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:23,785
No, no, no, no

517
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:39,094
It's not my room!
It's not my room!

518
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:43,604
It is my room, okay

519
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:51,152
- Senor?
- What?

520
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:53,612
- We clean room
- What?

521
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:55,862
- Room clean
- Oh no!

522
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:06,161
Hola

523
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:08,162
- Oh! I am...
- Paco?

524
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:17,210
No... I'm... blind... I'm blind
I mean, I mean, you're blind...

525
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,379
I'm a guest and I forgot something

526
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:42,777
- Adios
- Adios

527
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:27,483
- I draw the line on mass graves
- Mass graves?

528
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:31,992
You know, maybe we should just do
individuals, seven of them, you know?

529
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,072
This reminds me of when
I was a kid, I was thirteen years old

530
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:41,701
Me and my friends used to
rip the heads off Barbie dolls...

531
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,541
and burry them
in the mud in the backyard

532
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:48,501
- You used to rip the...
- Hola, amigos

533
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:53,920
Find any buried treasures, gringos?

534
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,220
We have laws about these deserts

535
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:01,100
They are environmentally protected now
you know

536
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,179
- Actually, no, we didn't know
- Si, si

537
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:07,100
We got protected snakes,
protected lizards

538
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,150
protected toads

539
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,610
Are you familiar with the
Mexican horny toad, chiquita?

540
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,319
- Oh, no
- Oh, yeah!

541
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:19,238
Mexican horny toad is a very special species

542
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:22,618
It's against the law
to hurt a horny toad in any way...

543
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:26,537
Oh! You just hurt a horny toad!

544
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:31,166
Laurie

545
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:35,007
Whoa, come on, amigos. Vamanos!

546
00:42:38,507 --> 00:42:40,347
- Are you all right?
- Yeah

547
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:48,054
No, shit! They stole my car!
Go get them!

548
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,434
- Senor
- Dick is going to kill me

549
00:42:56,144 --> 00:42:58,443
I want you to stay here at your hotel

550
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:00,403
- Okay
- You're much safer here

551
00:43:00,694 --> 00:43:03,653
- Okay, thank you
- Thank you

552
00:43:03,694 --> 00:43:05,113
Thank you, sir

553
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:11,992
- Senor , you forgot your bag
- Thank you, thank you, sir

554
00:43:13,913 --> 00:43:15,702
Thank you, good night

555
00:43:18,123 --> 00:43:19,923
Well, that went well

556
00:43:20,002 --> 00:43:23,132
- Charlie! I got it! Fed Ex it!
- What?

557
00:43:23,552 --> 00:43:25,461
Fed Ex them to Steve!

558
00:43:26,013 --> 00:43:28,631
Fed Ex them? Laurie, we're in Mexico
there is no Fed Ex

559
00:43:29,512 --> 00:43:33,220
Well, then, Mex Ex them, I don't care
the point is just ship them!

560
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:36,100
And just let Steve innocently
open a package full of heads?

561
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:38,939
Of course not, we'll call him

562
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,939
All right boys, I'd like
to do this forever but...

563
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:47,820
I'm sorry, I don't know what else to do
You know?

564
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,278
I think it's time that I got rid of you two and
moved along. Come on, come over here

565
00:43:52,408 --> 00:43:55,908
What? you, you can't just kill us
We're trying, all right? We're trying...

566
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:58,908
Trying? What are you talking about? What
does this look like the Special Olympics?

567
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,868
I need the bag! Get over here

568
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,417
- Well, wait...
- Trying, shit, get down!

569
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:05,836
Listen, we can call more people or...

570
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:07,298
Yes, we can help, man

571
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:09,506
I don't know what to do
I can go through friends

572
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,596
Can I answer that?
It might be Charlie, all right?

573
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:15,506
Put it on speaker phone

574
00:44:17,596 --> 00:44:19,176
- Hello?
- Steve

575
00:44:19,267 --> 00:44:21,596
- Oh God!
- Oh, Charlie, thank God. Jesus!

576
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:24,474
Listen to me, you asshole, you got my heads
and I want them back, you understand?

577
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:26,225
Who is this?

578
00:44:26,355 --> 00:44:28,815
Never mind who this is
I want those heads!

579
00:44:28,935 --> 00:44:31,354
Jesus Christ!
You're the guy from the airplane!

580
00:44:31,445 --> 00:44:32,775
Charlie, listen, listen...

581
00:44:32,814 --> 00:44:35,233
What does this look like, a family reunion?

582
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,783
Steve? What are you doing to Steve?

583
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:43,624
I'm killing him unless you
shut up and listen to me! Where are you?

584
00:44:43,873 --> 00:44:46,832
I'm in Baja
I'm six hours south of San Diego

585
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:51,084
Listen to me. You meet me at the San Diego
airport and bring all 8 heads with you

586
00:44:51,173 --> 00:44:54,674
San Diego airport? I'm
on vacation with my girlfriend's parents

587
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:58,591
Okay, okay, San Diego

588
00:44:58,802 --> 00:45:03,551
You make sure you're there by six o'clock
if you ain't there, your buddies are history

589
00:45:03,642 --> 00:45:08,472
- But what if I don't have all eight heads?
- What?

590
00:45:09,351 --> 00:45:13,521
- I lost one
- You lost one?

591
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:16,520
You lost one?
How the hell could you lose one?

592
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:18,690
The maid got it

593
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:21,741
What do you mean a maid got it?
How the hell did a maid...

594
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,780
What, what do you mean?
What, which one did you lose?

595
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,199
I don't know!

596
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,828
Oh Jesus! I can't
believe this shit! I can't believe this shit!

597
00:45:29,788 --> 00:45:31,578
Damn it!

598
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,420
What's happening?

599
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:35,918
I don't know
I don't think he's taking it too well

600
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:42,676
Charlie, listen. The guy is serious
he's not screwing around

601
00:45:42,757 --> 00:45:45,258
He's a psycho, all right?
You gotta do what he says, all right?

602
00:45:48,808 --> 00:45:50,217
- Are you there?
- Yes, yes

603
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:51,596
Yeah, listen to this

604
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:54,226
All right, bring the rest
and make sure you're there

605
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:55,766
Remember what I'm telling you now
you got it?

606
00:45:55,846 --> 00:45:58,686
- Got it. Before you hang up though...
- What?

607
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:02,276
If you hurt my friends
you'll never get them

608
00:46:02,316 --> 00:46:04,604
Charlie, what are you trying to do?
Are you threatening me?

609
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:10,865
No, I'm just telling you a fact...
and don't lose my book either

610
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:13,285
It's my only copy

611
00:46:13,325 --> 00:46:14,664
Charlie

612
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:21,413
All right! All right! All right!
Forget the book, I'll be there

613
00:46:21,504 --> 00:46:23,414
Yeah, you better

614
00:46:25,964 --> 00:46:27,543
What's happening?

615
00:46:30,093 --> 00:46:31,762
We have to go back to San Diego

616
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:37,682
San Diego? My dad will shit himself!
What are we going to tell him?

617
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:41,181
What to you mean he
forgot to turn in his lap report?

618
00:46:41,352 --> 00:46:44,181
- I know it sounds flaky and...
- Flaky? It's ridiculous!

619
00:46:44,232 --> 00:46:46,772
You mean he came all the way
to Mexico without turning in a report

620
00:46:46,812 --> 00:46:48,732
and for that we have to go home?

621
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,481
Mom is sick
and anyway it's your fault

622
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,859
My fault?

623
00:46:51,902 --> 00:46:54,031
He took your advice
He's decided on something

624
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:57,820
Well, he's decided that he'll never be
a member of this family, that's for sure

625
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:03,579
- We're leaving
- How did he take it?

626
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,619
It's gonna have to fall under
the category of blessing in disguise

627
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,419
I'll make it up to him
I'll give him a year of free analysis

628
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,298
- Cute. Here
- What's this?

629
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:18,389
It's a surprise for his birthday
He likes his macho stuff

630
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:22,717
Can you pack it in your bag?
I don't want him to see it

631
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:25,977
Where exactly would you suggest I put it?

632
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:28,646
- If we're going, let's get going
- Right, dad

633
00:47:31,186 --> 00:47:33,726
The shirt's for you. Get packing

634
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:52,453
And the macho
statue with all the disgusting...

635
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,335
Laundry

636
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:02,463
I didn't...

637
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,433
Thank you

638
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,800
Who's this guy? He might do

639
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:50,178
- Do for what?
- Hugo

640
00:48:50,258 --> 00:48:51,588
Wait a minute

641
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:55,098
Are you telling us you're trying to
find a look alike for the head Charlie lost?

642
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:58,677
Yeah. We got some time to kill
before we go to the airport

643
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:00,137
Oh, my God!

644
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:04,937
But these are college professors!
You know, innocent people!

645
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:09,526
You can't just kill innocent people
because they look like someone else

646
00:49:09,648 --> 00:49:12,107
Let me tell you something, college boy
nobody's innocent

647
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:13,616
Now, who is he?

648
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:18,285
He was my anatomy professor.
He almost flunked me

649
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:21,325
Good, here's your chance to get even
with the prick. Get me his address

650
00:49:21,746 --> 00:49:24,286
Wait a minute! I just thought of something!

651
00:49:24,785 --> 00:49:27,084
- What?
- Cryonics!

652
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:29,294
- Cry- what?
- Cryonics!

653
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:32,754
Frozen bodies! This university
has the biggest Cryonics Foundation

654
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:34,794
in the country

655
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:36,213
So what?

656
00:49:36,254 --> 00:49:38,962
So it could save you
a lot of troubles is so what!

657
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:42,973
You go on a killing spree here,
Big Sep's gonna hear about it

658
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:45,724
When a couple of gangsters die
nobody cares

659
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:49,103
But you blow away professors
Big Sep's gonna read about that

660
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:51,731
Big Sep don't read

661
00:49:52,063 --> 00:49:57,112
Still, this cryonics facility
has hundreds of frozen bodies

662
00:49:58,572 --> 00:50:00,361
Why they got hundreds of frozen bodies?

663
00:50:00,742 --> 00:50:04,242
- I think for situations like this
- Don't be a little smart ass

664
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:08,990
They have them because people are hoping
that in a couple hundred years...

665
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:13,001
...maybe they can bring them back to life,
clone them a healthy body

666
00:50:13,121 --> 00:50:15,001
- Are you jerking me around?
- What?

667
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:21,131
Oh, my God, he just put welts and bruises
over 90% of my body, now you're talking...

668
00:50:21,169 --> 00:50:24,299
...about having me help you decapitate some
professors. Would I be jerking you around?

669
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:26,638
Calm down, tough guy.
What are you trying to tell me?

670
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,978
I'm trying to tell you that right across campus
is a gold mine of heads

671
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,516
Heads R Us. Night of a Thousand Heads.

672
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:41,777
If I was a guy in desperate need of a head,
as you are, I'd at least check it out

673
00:50:46,776 --> 00:50:49,577
Senor, I can't find your jeep anywhere

674
00:50:49,618 --> 00:50:52,447
What do you mean you can't find it?
It's red, rojo

675
00:50:52,497 --> 00:50:56,456
Oh, my God. I forgot.
We, we went for a drive last night

676
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:59,124
and... it got stolen

677
00:51:00,545 --> 00:51:02,755
You forgot it was stolen?

678
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:04,716
Well, we...

679
00:51:04,796 --> 00:51:07,084
This is ridiculous! How the hell
are we going to get out of here?

680
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,175
It's not a problem, senor
take a plane

681
00:51:09,254 --> 00:51:11,673
Oh, a plane! A plane!
And where would we take a plane from?

682
00:51:11,716 --> 00:51:16,595
Here. Since you've been away, senor,
this has become a very important city

683
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:19,223
I mean we have built our own airport

684
00:51:19,264 --> 00:51:23,064
- A plane comes every day
- Well, aren't we lucky?

685
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:34,572
Now, that's a Hugo

686
00:51:36,823 --> 00:51:39,663
- This one's good?
- For Hugo Porter, unbelievable!

687
00:51:39,781 --> 00:51:41,622
All right, we got a keeper!

688
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:51,840
- What was that?
- Thawing it out

689
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:02,599
No way

690
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,388
Good God! Look at that!

691
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,230
Lassie, sit girl! Stay!

692
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:10,978
Oh my God!

693
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:16,647
Oh my God!
Guys! Ernie!

694
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:19,366
- What?
- I'm not very comfortable, perhaps

695
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:21,238
Why is that?

696
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,697
We're messing with
people's immortality here. It's murder!

697
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:28,998
Technically, it's not murder, Steve
because they're already dead

698
00:52:29,036 --> 00:52:32,876
No, these people,
they believed in the freezing thing

699
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:37,675
All right, this is like grave robbing,
grave robbing, or worse

700
00:52:38,045 --> 00:52:41,595
I don't see any graves.
Do you see any graves?

701
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:48,345
There's gonna be two fresh ones, if you
two don't start looking for heads, come on

702
00:52:55,274 --> 00:52:56,604
All right

703
00:52:56,814 --> 00:52:59,523
- Sir, I'm really sorry about the Jeep
- It's open seating

704
00:52:59,603 --> 00:53:02,571
Now you take these tickets
and you check in the big stuff

705
00:53:02,654 --> 00:53:05,534
We'll take the little stuff,
and we'll go get the seats

706
00:53:05,614 --> 00:53:06,942
Do you think you can handle that?

707
00:53:06,993 --> 00:53:08,864
Yes, I really appreciate you...

708
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,283
Come on, Bear. Come here

709
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:13,283
God!

710
00:53:14,622 --> 00:53:17,412
Permiso, senor ,
do you have anything to declare?

711
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,042
Any fruits, vegetables, native plants?

712
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:21,420
Are you kidding?

713
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:34,930
Sobrino! Sobrino!

714
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:39,809
Mira!
Mira! Que es eso?

715
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,599
No se, mira como esta aqui

716
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,230
Excuse me, could you
handle me my bag, please?

717
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,779
- Un momento, senor
- I don't have un momento!

718
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,648
I have a plane-o to catch-o, got it?

719
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:53,697
- Machete?
- No, sera una pistola?

720
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:57,448
Excuse me, it's right there, I can see it
I'll just reach in and get it myself, okay?

721
00:53:57,659 --> 00:54:00,407
Senor... no. No, Senor!

722
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:11,506
What? Is it dad?

723
00:54:14,386 --> 00:54:16,005
What?

724
00:54:17,305 --> 00:54:19,635
They found two heads in Dad's carry-on

725
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,095
Oh, no!

726
00:54:25,645 --> 00:54:27,475
Put me down! Put me down!

727
00:54:27,524 --> 00:54:29,024
Oh, my God!

728
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,064
Help me! Help me!

729
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,153
Oh, my God!

730
00:54:44,954 --> 00:54:49,663
- Decent, hold this one
- Yeah, wait. Do you need a Helen?

731
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:52,412
No, you can play with her when I leave
Get over there

732
00:54:56,212 --> 00:55:01,972
- This guy do anything for you?
- He's not bad either

733
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,970
Could be a Stu

734
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,679
- Yeah?
- Yeah

735
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,141
We could beat him a little bit
give him a few cuts

736
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,220
Random disfigurement

737
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:13,141
Yeah, definitely a Stu

738
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:16,398
Worth a try anyway.
I'll take him and I'll take him

739
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:20,109
- Great, I'll wrap them up
- What do you mean take? Huh?

740
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:27,279
You know, for a future doctor
you're a pretty stupid kid

741
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:30,618
I mean take the heads

742
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:36,536
No, No

743
00:55:36,629 --> 00:55:41,798
No, no way! You do it!
This is your crazy idea, okay?

744
00:55:41,878 --> 00:55:44,877
It's my idea that you should do it

745
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,846
But, he's a neurologist,
I'm only going into dermatology

746
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:51,175
So don't screw up the skin

747
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,984
Now there's a pleasant sound

748
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:18,123
Mr. Escobedo, this is my mother,
Annette, Charlie and Fran Bennett

749
00:56:18,163 --> 00:56:20,953
Dad's mom. She flew down to help us out

750
00:56:21,164 --> 00:56:23,543
Nona, this is Dad's Mexican lawyer

751
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:25,922
- Delighted
- Charmed

752
00:56:26,043 --> 00:56:28,503
Now, cut the crap and
tell us what the hell's going on!

753
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,042
Certainly

754
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:35,512
Miamigos, in your country

755
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,393
you have what you call
the good news and the bad news

756
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:43,141
The good news is that Mr. Bennet
underwent only very mild torture

757
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,139
- Jesus!
- Oh my God!

758
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,730
Shut up, you poodle. What's the bad news?

759
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:51,900
He confessed and was sentenced to death

760
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:55,739
- Oh my God!
- That little weakling!

761
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,119
Oh, Mom!

762
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,538
- Wait a minute. Don't get upset yet
- Not get upset?

763
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:05,368
Let the man speak, damn it!

764
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:08,208
There are remedies here.
This is a civilized country

765
00:57:08,288 --> 00:57:11,207
There's going to be a trial
some sort of hearing

766
00:57:11,248 --> 00:57:14,336
Of course. When my partner arrives,
we will formulate our strategy

767
00:57:14,628 --> 00:57:16,508
Until then, try to relax

768
00:57:16,588 --> 00:57:19,178
It's a beautiful day. Enjoy Mexico

769
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:21,257
I can't belive it

770
00:57:21,507 --> 00:57:23,806
Things get a little rough and he cracks

771
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:26,305
- Nona, they tortured him
- Oh, what?

772
00:57:26,388 --> 00:57:28,136
A little castor oil down his gullet?

773
00:57:28,268 --> 00:57:31,356
A little electricity on his dillywacker?

774
00:57:32,897 --> 00:57:34,225
Cat piss!

775
00:57:46,405 --> 00:57:48,285
I am spent!

776
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:53,084
Chopping off heads just takes it out of you

777
00:57:56,664 --> 00:57:58,544
Shit!

778
00:57:58,584 --> 00:58:01,134
Time to go, I got four heads
I'm screwed

779
00:58:01,464 --> 00:58:03,422
But you got a good start

780
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:06,842
I'm sure one of those heads
in there will do for the one Charlie lost

781
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:09,632
I doubt it, the way
my luck's running today, kid

782
00:58:10,513 --> 00:58:14,892
Let's take a second and
take stock of where we are so far

783
00:58:15,012 --> 00:58:17,141
Let me tell you something, kid, okay?

784
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:20,350
Just so you know,
I gotta kill the both of you

785
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:23,690
So don't think by helping me
it's gonna change that, all right?

786
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:27,570
Yeah, I know, sure, I'm just
saying that you're doing all right

787
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:29,319
you might be better off than you think

788
00:58:29,401 --> 00:58:32,280
Okay, but I'm just saying too
I want you to know

789
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:39,159
Okay, let's see. I got a Hugo, a Marty,
a so-so Stu, and a bad Frank

790
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,128
Right, and then at the morgue,
you said something about Little Joey

791
00:58:43,288 --> 00:58:44,627
- Right
- Okay

792
00:58:44,709 --> 00:58:48,088
All right, so I got Little Joey,
a Hugo, a Marty, and a bad Frank

793
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:52,126
- No, where's Stu?
- I said Stu, so-so Stu

794
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:54,177
No, just a second ago, you said Little Joey

795
00:58:54,219 --> 00:58:57,008
I know I said little Joey
but I also said Stu

796
00:58:57,058 --> 00:58:58,427
But then where's Frank?

797
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:03,977
All right, let's start over
You got a Hugo... a Little Joey...

798
00:59:04,267 --> 00:59:05,976
- ... a Frank...
- Yeah

799
00:59:06,066 --> 00:59:09,936
- A bad Stu...
- No... Frank... bad Frank

800
00:59:10,356 --> 00:59:11,695
That's what I said

801
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:14,024
No, you didn't, you said bad Stu,
Stu was just so-so

802
00:59:14,156 --> 00:59:17,615
No, sir, I said a so-so Stu
You did not. You said bad Stu

803
00:59:17,696 --> 00:59:19,535
Yes, I said. Everyone heard

804
00:59:19,576 --> 00:59:20,904
I said so-so Stu

805
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:23,864
You said bad Stu!
I know their names and you don't

806
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:27,204
Will you two stop it! Goddamnit!

807
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:33,043
These are not baseball cards
we're talking about here, all right?

808
00:59:33,424 --> 00:59:36,343
These are heads, human beings' heads

809
00:59:40,764 --> 00:59:42,304
Where were we?

810
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:46,142
- I said we have a Hugo
- Yes

811
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,851
Ho, ho, wait a minute, just a sec.

812
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:53,811
I can't believe I didn't notice this before

813
00:59:53,852 --> 00:59:55,190
What?

814
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:58,441
With some black hair and a busted
nose, this kid makes a decent Frank

815
00:59:58,521 --> 01:00:00,530
- What?
- Yeah

816
01:00:01,781 --> 01:00:04,990
I mean I know you're a little young,
but with that stubble

817
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,449
- a couple of missing teeth
- But you have a Frank

818
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,329
I got a bad Frank,
you make a better one

819
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,750
But you don't even know
if you need a Frank!

820
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:14,329
- I might
- Please no, please, no

821
01:00:14,369 --> 01:00:17,128
Listen, please, no, listen
I don't want any trouble

822
01:00:17,171 --> 01:00:18,839
Look, I fly, I fly

823
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,469
- What are you? A fairy?
- No, no, he has a pilot's license

824
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:26,388
You don't wanna fly commercial
airlines with all these heads

825
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:30,218
That's how you got in this whole mess.
He can fly us. It's smarter

826
01:00:30,258 --> 01:00:31,718
I fly

827
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:34,688
All right, grab all those heads.
Just leave the top one

828
01:00:34,769 --> 01:00:36,097
Why?

829
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:40,316
Because the top one doesn't look like
anybody and Big Sep will never buy it

830
01:00:40,397 --> 01:00:46,695
Wait just a minute! I sawed this off
and you re not even gonna use it?

831
01:00:46,737 --> 01:00:48,735
- Steve, chill
- No, you chill

832
01:00:48,866 --> 01:00:53,534
It s not fair. I spent a lot of time on this head

833
01:00:53,656 --> 01:00:57,575
Don't you think that you could've at
least told me this before I cut it off?

834
01:00:57,744 --> 01:01:00,034
I saw that coming

835
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:03,795
- Don't fuck with a guy looking for heads
- Good advice

836
01:01:04,505 --> 01:01:07,503
Now take all the heads and let's go, okay?

837
01:01:08,924 --> 01:01:12,883
- Big Sep, it's Benny
- Where the hell are my heads?

838
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:15,933
I just talked to Tommy a while ago.
He'll be there tomorrow

839
01:01:16,094 --> 01:01:20,433
First it was two weeks ago,
then three days ago

840
01:01:20,513 --> 01:01:22,643
I gave them to Tommy.
It's Tommy's deal now

841
01:01:22,684 --> 01:01:24,853
Don't you talk to me about Tommy.
I trust Tommy

842
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:27,392
This is your job

843
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,023
Big Sep, what are we talking about here

844
01:01:29,232 --> 01:01:32,860
Heads! It's not like they got any
value on the open market

845
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:34,281
It's not like we re talking diamonds here

846
01:01:34,362 --> 01:01:36,282
now that's what's bothering me Ben

847
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:39,911
A guy pays 80 grand
and doesn't see proof ...

848
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:46,750
He starts thinking maybe, just maybe he's
been double-crossed, you know what I mean?

849
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:53,208
Big Sep, I swear on the soul of my dead
mother, I off them myself

850
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,259
me, and Rico, I give you my word!

851
01:01:56,299 --> 01:01:59,298
Your word ain't what
I paid you 80 fucking grand for, Ben

852
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:04,098
I paid you 80 fucking grand
to see their fucking heads

853
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,139
Now you bring me their heads

854
01:02:10,729 --> 01:02:13,817
Bennie! Bennie, Bennie,
come in here, hurry up!

855
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:17,737
Bennie, you re not gonna believe
this! look, look at this!

856
01:02:20,107 --> 01:02:22,446
- My God! That's Hugo!
- That s Hugo and Stu, I mean...

857
01:02:22,527 --> 01:02:24,486
didn't I tell you he'd screw up,
Bennie, didn't I tell you?

858
01:02:24,656 --> 01:02:27,456
- This ain' t good
- What the hell's Big Sep gonna say, Bennie

859
01:02:27,825 --> 01:02:29,326
Shut up!

860
01:02:34,706 --> 01:02:37,334
Ernie Lipscomb,
Please pick up a courtesy phone

861
01:02:44,555 --> 01:02:45,964
This is Ernie Lipscomb

862
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:48,974
Ernie, it's Charlie. Let me talk to him

863
01:02:50,263 --> 01:02:55,393
- Sure. It's for you
- Yeah?

864
01:02:55,853 --> 01:02:59,522
Hi, it s Charlie, l...
I lost two more heads

865
01:02:59,604 --> 01:03:02,272
What? how could you
lose two more heads?

866
01:03:02,523 --> 01:03:06,323
- The police got them
- How could the police get them?

867
01:03:07,232 --> 01:03:10,362
The one I lost earlier,
I got it back

868
01:03:14,162 --> 01:03:15,491
What are you looking at?

869
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,999
He's talking about potheads

870
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,879
We re de-programmers
with marijuana anonymous

871
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:27,251
He hates to lose a client

872
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:33,008
Listen to me, you little incompetent
piece of shit! Where are you exactly?

873
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,969
The La Purisima Hotel

874
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:38,970
Don't move. Don't leave your room
for anything. I coming down there

875
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:41,728
If there s any more heads
missing by the time I get there

876
01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:44,437
I'm gonna replace them with your
family and your friends, you hear me, huh?

877
01:03:49,149 --> 01:03:52,238
He really cares, and
that's what makes him the best

878
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,446
What?

879
01:03:59,118 --> 01:04:02,406
I'm thinking that once he gets
these away from us your dad's a goner

880
01:04:03,037 --> 01:04:04,376
We gotta move

881
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:08,794
I, I saw a place just outside of here, we gotta
check into another hotel, come on, get up!

882
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:13,714
Uhm, I'll take these
I had nowhere else to put them

883
01:04:13,925 --> 01:04:16,844
I'll take these to the
American border, I'll give them to the police

884
01:04:17,006 --> 01:04:18,675
I'll rent a car
I'll drive all night

885
01:04:18,716 --> 01:04:20,054
- What am I gonna tell my mother?
- Tell her anything

886
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:23,473
Tell her we had a fight,
tell her I called you fat

887
01:04:23,515 --> 01:04:26,435
It doesn't matter what she thinks
the important thing is to save your dad

888
01:04:27,014 --> 01:04:28,894
I'm not fat

889
01:04:29,184 --> 01:04:32,103
Look Laurie, maybe your dad
was right about me

890
01:04:32,183 --> 01:04:35,023
Maybe, I'm a total nimrod
who can't follow through on anything

891
01:04:35,153 --> 01:04:37,273
But I got him into this

892
01:04:37,402 --> 01:04:40,902
I promise you, I'm gonna get him out

893
01:04:45,363 --> 01:04:47,322
Get your hands off her Maniac!

894
01:04:47,373 --> 01:04:48,781
Hold on!

895
01:04:48,831 --> 01:04:51,621
You may want me to think I'm crazy
but I'm not crazy and I'm not stupid

896
01:04:51,752 --> 01:04:55,501
you had those heads hidden in your room,
and then you pinned them on my Dick

897
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:56,920
Mom, what are you saying?

898
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:59,919
I'm calling the police on him,
I'm gonna do it right now

899
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,010
- No
- No

900
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:06,800
Mom, calling the police
is a bad idea. No, no

901
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:11,890
Laurie, I love you. Take your hand off the phone
you, back off, I know exactly what I am doing

902
01:05:11,929 --> 01:05:13,430
No, you, you're not thinking clearly

903
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,437
I am thinking perfectly. I know exactly
what I am doing. I told you to back off!

904
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:21,107
Operator? No, I wasn't yelling at you.
Could you get me the police please?

905
01:05:22,688 --> 01:05:26,736
Oh yes, operator, I need you
to get the police for me, policia?

906
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:33,748
Si, si, si, I'm trying to reach
the police, the policia, si, gracias...

907
01:05:37,286 --> 01:05:38,625
Yes, Si, Si!

908
01:05:38,827 --> 01:05:40,497
Yes, of course, I'll hold,
I'm happy to hold

909
01:05:40,627 --> 01:05:42,956
For Christ s sake, keep it down!

910
01:05:44,217 --> 01:05:47,546
Yes, oh, hello, police, yes, I have...

911
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:55,635
Charlie, hurry! Go!

912
01:06:00,765 --> 01:06:06,023
- I need to rent a car
- Sure, that's no problem

913
01:06:06,893 --> 01:06:11,733
We got chevys,
jeep, chevys...

914
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:15,283
Hey, that looks like our jeep

915
01:06:17,363 --> 01:06:20,991
Well, uh, there's a lot
of jeeps, you know, senor

916
01:06:21,033 --> 01:06:24,752
With this magazine in them? I don't
think so. This jeep was stolen from us

917
01:06:25,162 --> 01:06:28,002
I don't know, senor
a lot of people read magazines

918
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:30,881
On seizures? You gotta be kidding me!

919
01:06:31,882 --> 01:06:35,132
You really like that magazine, huh?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

920
01:06:35,342 --> 01:06:40,010
You rent this jeep,
I'm gonna throw in magazine for Nada

921
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,980
Unbelievable!

922
01:07:07,869 --> 01:07:11,497
Excuse me.
where can we rent a car? Thanks!

923
01:07:11,578 --> 01:07:14,378
All right, make sure it has A.C
Hold on, champ. Thanks

924
01:07:16,587 --> 01:07:19,005
Are you telling me I just passed out?

925
01:07:19,086 --> 01:07:21,465
Come on, drink up, you're a little dehydrated

926
01:07:23,096 --> 01:07:26,346
- I'm gonna get us packed
- My butt's staying right here

927
01:07:26,517 --> 01:07:28,676
Why? I hear
the Tropicana s wonderful

928
01:07:28,726 --> 01:07:34,226
It's a waste of money, honey! Give me
the two c's, a cot and a crapper, I'm set

929
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:35,604
But...

930
01:07:35,896 --> 01:07:37,895
Laurie, Charlie, it's Ernie

931
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:39,735
- Jesus!
- Who the hell is Ernie?

932
01:07:39,815 --> 01:07:42,234
- Nobody, grandma
- Well, he sure as hell seems to know you

933
01:07:42,274 --> 01:07:44,943
- No, grandma
- Is this some guy you're boffing on the side?

934
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:47,444
- Grandma!
- What the hell are you doing?

935
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:51,452
- Where's Charlie?
- Who are you?

936
01:07:51,783 --> 01:07:54,622
I asked you a question
where the fuck is Charlie?

937
01:07:54,743 --> 01:07:57,502
And I asked you a question,
who the fuck are you?

938
01:08:01,172 --> 01:08:03,791
Now that we're in this frigging
La Purisima, what do we do now?

939
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:07,632
We find a cop station and we get our heads

940
01:08:07,843 --> 01:08:09,171
All right

941
01:08:09,472 --> 01:08:11,431
Benny! Look! It's him! It's Tommy!

942
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:16,890
What the hell do you think he's doing?
Do you think he got the heads back already?

943
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,850
I don't know, but why
don't we follow him? Come no!

944
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:39,578
Where the hell is he going?

945
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:42,038
Keep following him

946
01:08:42,669 --> 01:08:44,458
I told Charlie to stay put

947
01:08:44,748 --> 01:08:47,166
I told that son-of-bitch to stay put

948
01:08:47,287 --> 01:08:50,007
So who are you? God?
Why the hell should he listen to you?

949
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:55,336
Oh! I am so groggy!
Do you mind if I lie down in the back?

950
01:08:55,967 --> 01:08:58,467
I don't give a shit what
you do lady, just keep quiet

951
01:08:58,507 --> 01:08:59,967
Watch your language

952
01:09:00,976 --> 01:09:03,055
Ow! Fern, stop it! Ugh!

953
01:09:14,104 --> 01:09:15,734
Oh! My God!

954
01:09:18,156 --> 01:09:21,615
Another head? Oh! My God!

955
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:26,072
Lady, lady, shut up!

956
01:09:27,534 --> 01:09:32,664
I can't stand it! I'm losing my mind!
Everywhere I look are heads!

957
01:09:32,873 --> 01:09:35,043
Shut up, lady! Jesus Christ!

958
01:09:35,294 --> 01:09:37,843
You're not the only person
on this planet with problems

959
01:09:38,253 --> 01:09:39,592
Shut it!

960
01:09:39,923 --> 01:09:41,302
Jesus! What a head case!

961
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:44,763
Is that supposed to be a joke? Killer humour!

962
01:09:46,722 --> 01:09:48,801
looks like this guy
I dated in High School

963
01:09:49,182 --> 01:09:51,140
Hugo Porto

964
01:09:58,021 --> 01:10:01,029
Hey, I think we're gonna pull over
because we need some gas soon

965
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:05,070
- Keep fucking driving
- Didn't I tell you to watch your language?

966
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:09,238
What are you doing? Where are you going?

967
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,790
Get your hands off me, you goon!
Don't fuck with me!

968
01:10:14,868 --> 01:10:16,537
Grandma!

969
01:10:23,628 --> 01:10:26,547
- My money says he ain't got the head
- Mine, too

970
01:10:27,007 --> 01:10:29,137
Man, how could you do that?

971
01:10:29,468 --> 01:10:31,598
- How could I what?
- Throw her off the cliff?

972
01:10:32,557 --> 01:10:34,476
A man can only take so much, Kid

973
01:10:36,518 --> 01:10:40,267
Oh! My God! I can't believe it!

974
01:10:41,226 --> 01:10:42,894
I can't believe he...

975
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:47,815
- I thought the old battle-ax would never die!
- Mom!

976
01:11:08,673 --> 01:11:10,042
What do you wanna do now?

977
01:11:10,754 --> 01:11:13,344
Keep following him,
but I don't like the smell of this

978
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:29,900
- Well, well, well, if it isn't our old amingo
- Oh! No! not again!

979
01:11:31,771 --> 01:11:34,730
Isn't once enough, huh?
Can't you give a guy a break?

980
01:11:35,111 --> 01:11:36,820
From one human being to another

981
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,989
That's, that's very moving, gringo

982
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:44,490
But the real question is, are we gonna
cut off your conjones? Or live them on?

983
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:48,580
You don't have to do this, come on guys,
you can't kill me, can't we flip for it

984
01:11:48,659 --> 01:11:50,539
You think you should kill me, flip for it?

985
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,249
- What?
- A coin, you know?

986
01:11:53,459 --> 01:11:57,048
Flip a coin, I win you let me go,
you win you mangle me

987
01:12:04,638 --> 01:12:06,096
you're a crazy man, gringo

988
01:12:13,307 --> 01:12:14,856
- Call it
- Heads

989
01:12:15,857 --> 01:12:18,276
Oh, you sure? you don't even wanna
you sure you don't wanna think about it?

990
01:12:18,316 --> 01:12:20,734
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life

991
01:12:51,473 --> 01:12:54,642
Juan! Don't take the keys!
Don't take the keys!

992
01:12:56,433 --> 01:12:57,813
Oh, God!

993
01:13:03,693 --> 01:13:06,233
Oh, this has not been a very good vacation

994
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,371
Hello? Hello!

995
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,039
Who's there?

996
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,380
Stop! Stop!

997
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:38,179
- Not your kind of music
- I hate that shit

998
01:13:40,598 --> 01:13:47,266
Are you talking to me?

999
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:53,778
I said, are you talking to me?

1000
01:13:57,446 --> 01:13:59,404
I don't know who you're talking to

1001
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:03,746
- I'm the only one here
- Shut the fuck up!

1002
01:14:04,075 --> 01:14:07,704
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, I'm talking to you, shut up!

1003
01:14:08,496 --> 01:14:12,165
Shut up... Screwball!

1004
01:14:15,794 --> 01:14:17,674
- What's that?
- What's what?

1005
01:14:17,754 --> 01:14:19,093
Stop! stop!

1006
01:14:19,845 --> 01:14:21,174
Oh! No!

1007
01:14:24,384 --> 01:14:26,645
Whoa, hold on now!
Hold on, hold on, just okay, okay

1008
01:14:26,803 --> 01:14:28,142
Hey, come here, stop

1009
01:14:28,853 --> 01:14:30,932
okay, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1010
01:14:38,901 --> 01:14:40,402
I thought I told you to stay put?

1011
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:43,111
Where's my heads? Where's my heads?

1012
01:14:43,193 --> 01:14:45,032
They're in the jeep
They're in the coolers

1013
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:47,952
- Good
- But I lost another one

1014
01:14:47,991 --> 01:14:49,330
What?

1015
01:14:49,782 --> 01:14:52,870
Here, coyote

1016
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:56,420
- What's he doing?
- The kid ain't dead, that's for sure

1017
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,789
Here coyote!

1018
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,299
- Shut!
- What?

1019
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:09,969
- Shut up!
- What? What is it?

1020
01:15:10,178 --> 01:15:12,467
I'm dead, shit, I'm dead

1021
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,429
Who, uh, whoever they are, it
doesn't look like they're coming after us

1022
01:15:14,728 --> 01:15:18,308
Not yet. Just the fact that
they're here means I'm dead though

1023
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:20,767
When? As soon as I give you the heads?

1024
01:15:21,228 --> 01:15:23,357
Or as soon as I get them across to the States

1025
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:26,528
Knowing them,
they're gonna let me take that risk too

1026
01:15:28,277 --> 01:15:29,776
Who are the heads anyway?

1027
01:15:29,868 --> 01:15:32,906
What? Non of your business
What the hell do you care?

1028
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:36,787
You spend your vacation with a bunch
of heads, you kind of want to know

1029
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:40,457
You think about their hopes and their dreams

1030
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,494
Their lives cut short

1031
01:15:44,205 --> 01:15:47,125
Hopes? Dreams? Those bums?

1032
01:15:47,505 --> 01:15:49,133
You have to feel something!

1033
01:15:49,215 --> 01:15:51,425
You don't just kill eight
people and not feel anything!

1034
01:15:53,135 --> 01:15:56,974
It don't really matter, but let's
just set the record straight, okay?

1035
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,052
First of all, I didn't
whack them, those guys did

1036
01:16:00,144 --> 01:16:02,563
Second, Mister Phi Beta Craphead

1037
01:16:02,644 --> 01:16:05,603
If I hadn't fucked up,
I'd be retiring after this

1038
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,772
Hey! Hey! look! look!

1039
01:16:13,773 --> 01:16:16,072
What is he doing? It looks like
he's chasing after a dog?

1040
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:21,782
- What if we could help each other out here?
- Impossible

1041
01:16:21,872 --> 01:16:23,201
Why?

1042
01:16:23,242 --> 01:16:27,201
Because you're stupid besides I'm not gonna
take the chance of going across that border

1043
01:16:27,961 --> 01:16:30,830
Well, if you know it all then how come
you're in this mess to begin with?

1044
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:32,751
Because of bad luck

1045
01:16:32,961 --> 01:16:35,670
It's not my fault that the bag
was to big to go in carry-on

1046
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:38,469
There was a gift shop right next to the gate

1047
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,679
Didn't you ever think of taking two bags?

1048
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,678
Oh! Shit!

1049
01:16:47,599 --> 01:16:52,060
So I'll repeat the question, what if there's
where a way we could help each other out?

1050
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:54,858
What way?

1051
01:17:07,078 --> 01:17:09,746
I'm not into mass murder
if I'm not getting paid for it

1052
01:17:10,078 --> 01:17:13,247
But I'm warning you,
anybody gets in my way is dead

1053
01:17:14,037 --> 01:17:17,166
- Thank you again for getting rid of fern
- Mom!

1054
01:17:17,336 --> 01:17:20,875
The going rate five thousand
dollars, but you can owe me lady

1055
01:17:30,344 --> 01:17:31,934
Where's he going?

1056
01:17:32,135 --> 01:17:34,894
I don't know,
Do I look a mind reader? Let's go, come on

1057
01:17:36,604 --> 01:17:38,814
So now what do we do?
Drive to the border?

1058
01:17:38,893 --> 01:17:41,694
Hello no! We gotta get those
heads back and save your dad

1059
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:47,154
Hey! Come back here! I'll kick your ass!

1060
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,928
- Come on Bennie let's take him now
- I expect that's exactly what he wants

1061
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,100
Uh, let's see, how lucky

1062
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:26,770

1063
01:18:30,938 --> 01:18:32,859
Ah, we got Benito

1064
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:39,739
Little Joey

1065
01:18:40,909 --> 01:18:42,657
What is he doing?

1066
01:18:42,707 --> 01:18:45,577
I don't know, it s like he's teasing us
wait a minute it's caught on my neck!

1067
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:51,006
Ouch, Jamal, you wanna bite, huh?

1068
01:18:52,716 --> 01:18:54,175
Jamal! Jamal!

1069
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:56,677
Let's see, what do I need?

1070
01:18:57,176 --> 01:19:00,466
I need a Stu,
a Frank and a Hugo

1071
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:08,645
There's a Hugo

1072
01:19:08,685 --> 01:19:10,604
- Who is it?
- It looks like Stu or Hugo

1073
01:19:12,025 --> 01:19:18,155
Frankie you suck...
but you're gonna have to do, buddy

1074
01:19:18,813 --> 01:19:20,152
How many has he got now?

1075
01:19:20,195 --> 01:19:23,444
He's got one, two seven, eight .

1076
01:19:23,573 --> 01:19:25,783
- He's got all eight heads
- I'm gonna make him the ninth head

1077
01:19:25,913 --> 01:19:30,082
And you, you I definitely don't need

1078
01:19:32,243 --> 01:19:34,083
what a bunch of douchebags!

1079
01:19:36,173 --> 01:19:40,801
Lost dreams! What a crock!

1080
01:19:44,801 --> 01:19:50,180
This coyote won't
be doing anymore running away

1081
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:12,738
I got him trained!

1082
01:20:12,868 --> 01:20:14,947
That is disgusting
I can't leave it outside for the coyotes

1083
01:20:17,038 --> 01:20:19,628
Everybody be still,
this is our last match

1084
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:26,797
Good work Steve, you asshole!

1085
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:30,586
That's it,
we're just gonna have to wait till dawn

1086
01:20:39,056 --> 01:20:40,395
Steve, shut up!

1087
01:20:41,976 --> 01:20:45,605
Heads up!
Stop ahead!

1088
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:47,604
Anybody need to use the head!

1089
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,484
Steve, shut up and go to sleep

1090
01:20:52,735 --> 01:20:57,074
Oh, don't let it go to your head
whoa, whoa, whoa, you're way ahead of me

1091
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:58,614
Steve!

1092
01:20:59,413 --> 01:21:01,574
Hey, don't bite my head off, all right?

1093
01:21:02,744 --> 01:21:05,624
- That's it, I m sleeping outside guys
- Me too

1094
01:21:05,753 --> 01:21:09,543
Steve! Get a grip, go to sleep

1095
01:21:09,753 --> 01:21:12,632
Or what, huh? You'll have my head?

1096
01:21:15,173 --> 01:21:16,591
Enough!

1097
01:21:44,829 --> 01:21:46,538
Mr. Hitman

1098
01:21:46,829 --> 01:21:48,497
I'm so alone

1099
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:52,747
Ain't got no body to call my own

1100
01:21:52,919 --> 01:21:56,379
Ain't got no legs for walking all over

1101
01:21:56,627 --> 01:22:00,336
Can't hold my liquor
so I gotta stay sober

1102
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:03,836
Mr. hitman, give me a break

1103
01:22:04,096 --> 01:22:07,516
Tell Mr. Pizza that I ain't no steak

1104
01:22:07,848 --> 01:22:10,807
Please put on your magic sheen

1105
01:22:10,977 --> 01:22:13,645
Mr. Hitman bring me a dream

1106
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:27,023
Jesus!

1107
01:22:35,915 --> 01:22:39,374
- Bennie! Wake up! He's up! He's up!
- I'm up! I'm up! Relax!

1108
01:22:41,463 --> 01:22:44,672
Damn it! This always works on the Camaro

1109
01:22:45,004 --> 01:22:48,174
- You can do it
- I Know. All right!

1110
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,459
Can I get some breakfast here?

1111
01:23:22,499 --> 01:23:24,918
Si, Senior, please, sit anywhere you like

1112
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:31,089
- Bennie, what the hell is he doing?
- I don't know, let's go find out, shall we?

1113
01:23:32,209 --> 01:23:34,588
- Coffee, Senor?
- Uh, yeah, good

1114
01:23:35,049 --> 01:23:36,717
- Juice?
- Sure

1115
01:23:53,526 --> 01:23:55,735
Wow, look at this surprise!

1116
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:59,235
Bennie, Rico, you boys decide
to take a vacation?

1117
01:23:59,866 --> 01:24:02,575
Yeah, Tommy, you know
we never seen Mexico

1118
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:05,154
We figured this is a good time to check it out

1119
01:24:05,245 --> 01:24:07,324
Good, good... it's nice down here

1120
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:11,244
l know you re waiting for me
to cross over to the States

1121
01:24:11,374 --> 01:24:13,873
But I gotta tell you now, when I do

1122
01:24:14,044 --> 01:24:17,333
You'll get that bag
over my dead body

1123
01:24:18,134 --> 01:24:21,842
Funny. We was thinking
exact same thing, huh, Rico?

1124
01:24:27,973 --> 01:24:29,301
That's his Van

1125
01:24:32,603 --> 01:24:35,103
The guy with the van, where is he?

1126
01:24:35,181 --> 01:24:36,732
Uh, he's in the hotel, Senior

1127
01:24:36,983 --> 01:24:39,021
You're not going in there
after him , are you?

1128
01:24:39,061 --> 01:24:41,271
We need those heads, yes,
I'm going in there

1129
01:24:42,901 --> 01:24:44,821
l can't believe you're actually doing this

1130
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:07,469
Give me your guns

1131
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:10,009
Jesus! Charlie, where'd you get that?

1132
01:25:10,089 --> 01:25:12,178
- It looks like mine
- It was yours

1133
01:25:12,258 --> 01:25:14,347
You dropped it in the dessert,
now it's mine

1134
01:25:14,428 --> 01:25:16,386
now both of you, put your guns on the table

1135
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:18,347
Or I'm gonna blow your heads off

1136
01:25:20,347 --> 01:25:21,766
Right now!

1137
01:25:26,896 --> 01:25:28,816
Laurie, get the guns

1138
01:25:32,197 --> 01:25:33,696
Ernie, get the duffel bag

1139
01:25:33,736 --> 01:25:35,195
- Wait a minute!
- Easy, kids

1140
01:25:35,285 --> 01:25:36,615
You don't wanna mess with these guys

1141
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:39,414
He's right, Charlie, what do you
want those heads for anyway?

1142
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,075
He's gonna take them to the border,
and turn in, right, Charlie?

1143
01:25:42,534 --> 01:25:45,414
- You'll be a hero with her old man
- Something like that

1144
01:25:45,455 --> 01:25:49,793
Forget about it, you do that
and Big Sep kills us all

1145
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:52,504
Fuck Big Sep!

1146
01:25:56,464 --> 01:26:00,223
- Mrs. Bennett, Senor Prit-Shit
- Paco

1147
01:26:04,764 --> 01:26:08,352
We're F.B.l!
He's the Unibell man

1148
01:26:12,102 --> 01:26:13,481
Senora Bennett?

1149
01:26:17,533 --> 01:26:18,991
Back off

1150
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,619
Come on, Laurie, drive faster

1151
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:32,460
What have you done?
Laurie, why do you have guns?

1152
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:33,918
What... what...

1153
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:36,250
Senor Pritchit, senor Bennett,
what's happening? What's this all about?

1154
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,709
It's about heads

1155
01:26:37,799 --> 01:26:40,218
- Steve, leave him alone
- Why does she have guns?

1156
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:45,259
Look! See? Heads ! All right?

1157
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,967
I know, but it's okay, Paco, Paco

1158
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:51,888
I told you it wasn't recyclable

1159
01:26:52,848 --> 01:26:55,017
Paco, it's okay, Paco

1160
01:27:02,988 --> 01:27:05,868
Charlie, what are we gonna do? Charlie?

1161
01:27:06,486 --> 01:27:08,785
- What are you doing?
- Ernie, give me the duffel bag

1162
01:27:11,036 --> 01:27:12,535
Everybody stay in the car!

1163
01:27:13,117 --> 01:27:14,495
Steve, stay in the car!

1164
01:27:16,746 --> 01:27:18,745
Move, please! Move!

1165
01:27:24,586 --> 01:27:26,845
Hola! Hola!

1166
01:27:29,465 --> 01:27:30,804
I have something to declare!

1167
01:27:31,015 --> 01:27:34,393
His mistake, he doesn't have anything

1168
01:27:34,474 --> 01:27:35,973
Arrest them! Arrest them!

1169
01:27:37,144 --> 01:27:38,724
That's his bag! Arrest them

1170
01:27:42,484 --> 01:27:43,983
All right, everybody freeze!

1171
01:27:44,024 --> 01:27:46,772
Don't do anything stupid
and nothing stupid will happen

1172
01:27:46,983 --> 01:27:48,772
- Get to the plane, Rico
- Oh! Shit!

1173
01:27:53,243 --> 01:27:54,863
No need to be excited!

1174
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:57,031
Charlie!

1175
01:27:57,201 --> 01:28:00,750
We're just getting in the plane and
fly away, bye-bye, have a nice day

1176
01:28:02,332 --> 01:28:03,660
Arrest them!

1177
01:28:03,831 --> 01:28:05,211
Drop your guns or I'm gonna shoot him

1178
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,210
- Move in, goddamnit!
- No!

1179
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:10,089
Charlie! No!

1180
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:14,718
Arrest them!
Check their bag! Open their bag!

1181
01:28:14,799 --> 01:28:17,428
There's a human head in the bag!

1182
01:28:24,139 --> 01:28:25,769
The man you arrested
yesterday is in jail

1183
01:28:25,808 --> 01:28:27,478
for the murders these guys committed

1184
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:29,108
He father is innocent

1185
01:28:29,398 --> 01:28:31,357
These are the guys who did it

1186
01:28:33,148 --> 01:28:34,487
Right there!

1187
01:28:35,657 --> 01:28:37,777
Wait a minute!
That's not ours!

1188
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:40,527
- You arrested us for the wrong head!
- Rico

1189
01:28:40,658 --> 01:28:42,157
- Our heads are not here!
- Shut up!

1190
01:28:42,327 --> 01:28:44,497
- Where are our heads, asshole?
- Shut up, Rico

1191
01:28:47,286 --> 01:28:48,625
Al suelo!

1192
01:29:03,054 --> 01:29:05,265
You knew it? You planned it?

1193
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:23,862
- You got a future, kid!
- Thanks

1194

"Slight of Bag by Charlie Pritchett"

1195
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,679
Show me the law about
bringing a head out of the country

1196
01:29:56,810 --> 01:30:00,600
It ain't a fruit, it ain't a vegetable
it ain't a native plant, goddamnit!

1197
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:12,657
Alto! Alto!

1198
01:30:13,527 --> 01:30:15,576
You can't have it!
It's mine!

1199
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:19,617
I spent a lot of time on this head
It's my best friend!
