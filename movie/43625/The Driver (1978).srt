I haven't seen them.

492
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:48,331
You better stay out of sight for a while.

493
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:50,931
There's a cop trying to put this one on me.

494
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:54,411
The money's hot. I wanna trade it in.

495
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:56,731
The exchange rate's 4-to-1 at best.

496
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:01,011
I'll take it. The train station, 9:00.

I don't like it.

I didn't think you would.

500
00:58:14,131 --> 00:58:15,971
I'll set it up...

but they won't do it if you're there.

I'll get somebody.

504

Keep your eye out for those other two.

505
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:32,211
They'll know I have their money.

506

I told you, I'm not
gonna get killed for you.

Just tell me what you want.

00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:59,571
I just set things up.

511
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:03,171
It's his business what happens after that.

512
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:08,891
If it was jewelry or bonds,
he might come to me.

513
01:00:08,931 --> 01:00:10,851
But with cash, he doesn't need me.

514
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:20,411
I won't see him till the next one.

The money's in a locker
at the train station.

518
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,771
9:00 he's trading for smaller bills.

519
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:16,411
That's all.

520
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:28,291
I warned him.

521
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:33,131
I told him I wouldn't get killed for him.

522
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:38,651
Sure.

No.

You go to jail.

I'd tell you to go ahead.
