1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
We open now at two draw.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,710
I'm number three buy-in.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,130
On the 10 draw,
G-V-U, please.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,130
G-V-U.
J-R-C.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,680
We open now at two draw.
Two and four draw seen.

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,980
Five and 10 draw.
She opens five runs.

7
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,330
Sorry.

8
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,340
Give me a 5 draw,
please.

9
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,470
Take the seat
right here, sir.

10
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,970
Starting a new game now.
Playing blind fives and 10s.

11
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,510
The game... five-blind, lowball.

12
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,910
We got a 211 in progress.

13
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,040
All right.

14
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,160
South side, near Lincoln.

15
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,830
Casino.

16
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,380
You called it.

17
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,980
Suspects are described
as two males wearing dark...

18
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,310
Four units on their way.

19
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,110
...male Caucasian, late 20s,
sandy, wavy hair.

20
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,940
That's him.
Yeah.

21
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,700
Same goddamn stunt
he pulled six weeks ago.

22
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,160
You two wanna tell me
who we're talking about?

23
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,030
Shut up.
I want to hear this.

24
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,070
Look out!

25
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,050
Look out!

26
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,640
Look out.

27
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,530
God! Turn it! Look out!

28
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,550
All units in the vicinity,

29
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,220
3849 reports that
the police units pursuing
suspects' vehicle...

30
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,010
were involved
in a traffic accident...

31
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,060
at Pruitt and 34th Street.

32
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,480
Poker Palace first.
You call in.

33
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,570
1 -Y-10. Code 6.
813 North Cleveland.

34
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,030
$23,500.

35
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,200
Are you sure
none of those people
got a good look at you?

36
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,040
See, we wanna keep you healthy
for next time.

37
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,710
There isn't going to be any next time.

38
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,290
You were late.

39
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,410
Well, well, well.
Lookee here.

40
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,830
Cowboy.
No shit.

41
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,140
Well?

42
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,600
It kind of looks like him to me.

43
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,310
You sure?

44
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Can't say for sure.

45
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,030
What about you?

46
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,280
You know, I just didn't
get that good a look at him.

47
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,790
You?

48
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,750
She saw him
better than I did.

49
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,130
Who?
She did.

50
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,340
What do you mean, "she"?
On the end.

51
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,470
In the black?

52
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,110
Is that him?

53
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,410
You can take your time,
because there's no way
he can ever get to you...

54
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,490
absolutely no way.

55
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,790
It wasn't him.

56
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,410
You sure?

57
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,880
Yeah.

58
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
You're positive?

59
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,260
It wasn't him.

60
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
How about the rest of you?

61
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,900
Guide dogs for everyone,
is that it? Huh?

62
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,740
Planning on looking for work soon?

63
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,330
My line of work
is kinda hard to come by.

64
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,410
Depends on where you look.

65
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,290
Depends on who you are.

66
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,710
I don't know.

67
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,060
Some of
the criminal types
these days,

68
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,640
they, uh, think that
they're real cowboys.

69
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,690
Think that they can
just, uh, drive around,

70
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,820
do whatever they want to do...

71
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,070
whenever they wanna do it.

72
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,200
Mmm.

73
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,920
I respect a man that's good
at what he does.

74
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,880
I'll tell you
something else.

75
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,970
I'm very good at what I do.

76
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,060
Now, last night...

77
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Oh, I forgot.

78
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,730
His memory's not too good
about last night.

79
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,070
I remember everything.
Alone in your room?

80
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,030
Yeah.

81
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,160
You can do better than that.

82
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,950
I don't have to.

83
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,760
Go ahead throw it!
It'll cost you two years.

84
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,510
Go on.

85
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,930
You wanna throw it?
Go on. Go on.

86
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,520
Go on.

87
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,850
You know what I'm gonna do?

88
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,190
I'm gonna catch the cowboy
that's never been caught.

89
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,070
Cowboy desperado.

90
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,200
Now get out of here.

91
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,420
You all set?
Yeah.

92
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,340
How about you?

93
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,930
Yeah.

94
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,600
You sure?
Sure.

95
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,200
Open the door!

96
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,710
Can't you open
the goddamn door?

97
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,040
You asshole!
Can't you even open the door?

98
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,260
Drive, you son of a bitch!
Drive!

99
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,140
Watch it!
Watch that damn truck!

100
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,480
Watch it! Jesus!

101
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,100
Well, well, well.

102
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,680
Look what
the old van drug in.

103
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,520
What kind of piece did he have?

104
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,280
Wow! .45.

105
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,660
Very nice gun.

106
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,330
You know, that supermarket's
gonna cost you 10 years.

107
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,620
I don't know about any supermarket.

108
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,210
Yeah, you do.
Why don'tcha come on inside?

109
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,140
How about a beer?

110
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,010
Rather not, if that's okay by you.

111
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,720
Well, it's fine by me.

112
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,980
Today's your lucky day.

113
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm feeling generous.

114
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,730
I'm gonna give you a choice.

115
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,530
You and your bunch are
gonna do one more job...

116
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,240
a bank, nice big one...

117
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,990
for free.

118
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,710
You're gonna hire
a new driver, that's all.

119
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,290
A good one.

120
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,340
I don't work with cops.

121
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,180
Oh, gosh.

122
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
I wish you hadn't said that.

123
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Ow! Goddamn you!

124
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,690
Now, about this bank.

125
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,780
Cash on hand: 200,000.

126
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,780
That's bait for the man
you're gonna hire.

127
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,950
He does know banks.

128
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,620
You set it up in a week
or you're...

129
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,830
Yeah, I know all about 10 years.

130
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,040
Well, that's the choice.

131
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,460
Do 10 years
wearing a number...

132
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,380
or trust me...

133
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,090
and walk away... free.

134
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,060
You're getting in pretty deep
on this one, aren't you?
That's my business.

135
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,890
Setting up bank jobs?
I don't remember that being
part of taking the oath.

136
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,230
We're getting
the money back, jerk-off.

137
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,400
And we're catching somebody
that's never been caught.

138
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
That's a public service.

139
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,410
How many banks
in this city...

140
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,410
get hit every month?

141
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,990
Oh, 15, on the average.

142
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,000
How many end up
with a collar?

143
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,000
On the average?
About eight or nine.

144
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,330
See there?
We're raising the average.

145
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,750
Brilliant.
Try to sell that downtown.

146
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,670
I sold it to myself.
That's enough.

147
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,510
I want the cowboy.

148
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,180
You wanna play this your way?
Fine. You're the boss.

149
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,680
But I'm telling you something:
I'm in this for the win.

150
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,100
You blow this thing
then you can say good-bye
to your badge.

151
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,480
You know something?
Maybe I oughta investigate
in your background, huh?

152
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,690
Did you ever think of that?
Some little item there?

153
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,320
Maybe there's something
we should know about.
Maybe you're a fruiter.

154
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,320
Yeah.
Or maybe you
took a bribe.

155
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,320
I wonder
how much it was.
Investigate all you want.

156
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,360
You'd just be disappointed.
I'm not gonna take your word
for it. How's that?

157
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,950
I got a wife and I got a kid
and I got 12 years' service
toward a pension.

158
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,120
Now, if you think I'm gonna
let you blow that for me,
you're crazy.

159
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,960
Think about it.
I already have,

160
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,380
asshole.

161
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,200
I didn't think
you'd be the one to pay me.

162
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,580
Kind of taking a chance,
aren't you?

163
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,750
I'll pay you here
if you want.

164
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,920
Come on up.

165
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,160
I've been paid to do
a few things before,

166
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,120
but I was never paid
to be an alibi.

167
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,750
You're going to ask me
why I did it?

168
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,340
I have a friend
that pays the rent...

169
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,420
lives out of town,

170
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,090
visits me
once or twice a month.

171
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,850
Lately the checks
haven't been so regular.

172
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,270
I need the money.

173
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,360
Hello.

174
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,700
No, I don't think...

175
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,790
He's on his way up to see me.

176
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,630
The cop.

177
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,240
Guess that means
I can come in.

178
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,030
Nice place.

179
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,950
Terrific view. Ah.

180
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,460
You didn't come by
to tell me that.

181
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,090
You saw the man
who was driving the car.

182
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,810
And you saw the man
up against the brick wall.

183
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,690
And you know
it's the same man,

184
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,900
yet you didn't identify him.

185
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,110
Are you afraid of him?

186
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,490
No.

187
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,660
Are you afraid of me?

188
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,580
No.

189
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,790
I just don't like you.

190
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,210
You got a reason?

191
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,470
Must be because
I'm such a good cop.

192
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,930
How old are you?

193
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,150
Twenty-two.

194
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
I did a little checking.

195
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,780
What else did you check?

196
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,830
Well, a young girl like yourself,

197
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,040
you sure have been
around the track
a few times, honey.

198
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,380
Hmm.

199
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,210
Led a real active life.

200
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,800
Get out.

201
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,180
No.

202
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,800
We're gonna do
a little business, you and I.

203
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,480
Look at it!

204
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,150
You sure that's not him?

205
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,830
It's not him.

206
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,660
Really?

207
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,500
Maybe you oughta
be afraid of me.

208
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,840
I ran a make on you.

209
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,350
You're clean.
No problem.

210
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,270
Of course,
there was that, uh,

211
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,270
one little scrape.

212
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,030
You remember?

213
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,820
The kinda nasty one.

214
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,910
The one that got
swept under the rug.

215
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,660
Now, when your
memory improves, honey,

216
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,540
give me a call.

217
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,240
No guarantees.

218
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,160
Never has been.
He might still be down there.

219
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,130
How'd the new girl work out?
She did her job.

220
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,220
Who did you have
pay her off?

221
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,270
I did it myself.

222
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,140
That's not like you.

223
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,060
Why am I here?

224
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,400
Some people wanna meet.

225
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,530
They're from downtown.
They've done a few jobs.

226
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,780
Shooters.
Yeah.

227
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,910
I told you I don't like guns.

228
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,870
I know. But they're
looking to move up.

229
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,870
They got their eyes set
on something special.

230
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,580
They know my price?

231
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,790
Everybody knows your price.

232
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,170
Even paid me $300
just to get to you.

233
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,170
You did.

234
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,300
How you been?

235
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,260
I'm okay.

236
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,350
You two know each other?

237
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,560
Couple of years ago,
we worked a two-car job.

238
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,650
You already have a driver.

239
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,400
He don't have the balls
for driving anymore.

240
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
You work for a piece, right?

241
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,910
$10,000 up front...

242
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,210
against 15%.

243
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,420
How do we know
you're that good?

244
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,920
Get in.

245
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,290
All right! Enough, lunatic.
Enough of this shit!

246
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,480
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

247
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,320
We believe you!
We believe you!

248
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,290
Enough! That's enough!
Stop, will you?

249
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,850
I mean,
for Christ's sake!

250
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,690
For Christ's sakes!

251
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,290
Jesus!

252
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
Easy, easy.

253
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,570
Better get new plates
if you plan on taking it out again.

254
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,200
People might be looking for you.

255
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,700
You're crazy.

256
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,380
We'll make you a deal.

257
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,100
I don't work
with people like you.

258
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,770
Or him.

259
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,410
This plan of yours
for our friend...

260
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,330
taking a little long to set up, isn't it?

261
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,790
Gotta be patient, pal.

262
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,500
Ah, I see.
Every job has its problems.

263
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,920
Couldn't be you just
figured it wrong?

264
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,130
You know something?

265
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,600
I think I'm gonna have to
help you with your education.

266
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,190
This is the quiet part
of the hunt.

267
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,900
Trap's all set.

268
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,400
Cowboy's out there somewhere.

269
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,400
It wouldn't be any fun if the cowboy
just walked right into it, would it?

270
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,990
That'd be no fun.

271
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,360
You know the best part
of our job is?

272
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,120
It's just a game.
It's either them or us.

273
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,750
Maybe me and you.
Oh, no way, Jose.

274
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,210
You're not even in my league.

275
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,880
I tell you what, though.
I'm a very generous man.

276
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,430
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna help you be
a better cop.

277
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,550
You know how?

278
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,890
You know what you do
first thing every morning?

279
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,220
Read the sports page.

280
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,180
You know why?

281
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,230
Best part of the newspaper.

282
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,690
Winners, losers,
how it happened, score.

283
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,570
Now, we've got a better game
than the one they give
the players.

284
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,240
They don't retire us
after 10 years.

285
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,240
Just one thing.

286
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,910
You gotta be a player,

287
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,080
a real player,

288
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,330
not just filling out a position.

289
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,920
I guess you figure you're a winner.

290
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,680
That's it.
And you're a loser.

291
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,550
But I think you'd like
to be a winner.

292
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,470
And you're gonna
show me the way, huh?

293
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,770
Unless, of course, you turn into
a complete asshole first.

294
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,770
Let's move.

295
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,000
I just wanna talk.

296
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,630
We need you.

297
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,260
You're valuable.

298
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,600
I already gave you guys an answer.

299
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,480
We don't like that answer.

300
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,980
Be friendly.
Do things our way.

301
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,900
Go ahead and pull the trigger.

302
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,960
You... You do anything else,

303
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,380
I'll come back.

304
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,680
I'll kill you.

305
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,400
I'm just trying to do my job.

306
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,990
So am I.

307
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,990
Go home.

308
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,500
I just wanted to talk.

309
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,830
You did.

310
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,360
Let's talk, okay?
Go ahead.

311
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,120
I'm having
a very big problem
with your boy.

312
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,120
He's not too thrilled
in working with us.

313
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,080
I can understand that.

314
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,210
Look, I don't know what to do.
I'm doing the best I can,
you know?

315
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,130
You know what to do.
You just did it.

316
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,720
You came in here
and asked me to save your ass.

317
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
That's what I'm gonna do...

318
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,810
save your ass.

319
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,670
Guess I can't
leave you alone, can I?

320
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,100
Guess I'm just
a real friendly guy.

321
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,190
A friend of yours told me
where I could find you
in the middle of the day.

322
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,190
I don't have any friends.

323
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,320
That's right.

324
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,320
No friends.

325
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,490
No steady job.

326
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,620
No girlfriend.

327
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,780
You live real cheap.

328
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,960
You don't ask any questions.

329
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,380
Boy, you got it down real tight.

330
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,800
So tight there's no room
for anything else.

331
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,260
That's a real sad song.

332
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,220
Only trouble is,
sad songs ain't selling this year.

333
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,280
Maybe I'm your friend.

334
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,620
Present.
I brought it for you.

335
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,580
Found it on the floorboard
of some Ford a cowboy boosted.

336
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,590
Go ahead, take it.

337
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,960
Save you the trouble
of making another one.

338
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,350
I really like chasing you.

339
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,990
Sounds like you got a problem.

340
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,950
Oh, ho.

341
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,830
I'm much better at this game
than you are.

342
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,080
You play against me, pal,
you're gonna lose.

343
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,210
You win, you make some money.

344
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,920
I win, you're gonna do 15 years.

345
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,510
How about it, driver?

346
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,500
My price has doubled.

347
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,340
Come on. Who do you think
you're dealing with?
That's 30% of the take.

348
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,260
That's right.
Special price because I'm
working with second-raters.

349
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,720
We'll make your deal.

350
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,350
I want him to say it.

351
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,770
Yeah.

352
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,850
One more thing.
You're not coming.

353
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:01,190
You don't give many choices,
do you, pal?

354
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,070
That's right.

355
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,290
It's a two-man job inside.
Uh, you'll get your cut later.

356
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,000
I don't like it.

357
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,630
That's the whole idea.

358
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,840
Boy, it's tough
to like that man, I tell you.

359
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
We got him.
He's doing the job.

360
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,950
Look, I gotta
tell you something.

361
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,330
It's very important
for you to get this.

362
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,540
Hold up your end of this deal.

363
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,210
'Cause if I should see any cops at all
in front of that bank... any at all...

364
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,260
there's gonna be
a lot of shooting going on.

365
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,270
Now listen to me!
I don't want any shooting.

366
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,850
Got that?

367
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,190
Got it?
Yeah, I got it.

368
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,900
I just need one thing
out of you,

369
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,110
and that's the drop point.

370
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:28,200
Understand?

371
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,120
That way, I get my man,
I get the money,

372
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,200
and the money gets back
to the people it belongs to.

373
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,880
Straighten up
your little corduroy jacket.

374
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,130
Now piss off.
I'm sick of lookin' at you.

375
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,470
You really do like to lean,
don't ya?
It's part of the job, pal.

376
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,640
Yeah? It doesn't
make things too easy,
lemme tell you.

377
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,060
The man's afraid of heights.

378
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,820
Goddamn it!
You set the alarm off!

379
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,370
Come on!
Now move!

380
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,830
Move, move, move,
move, move!

381
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,000
Let's go.

382
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:28,010
No!
You triggered
the alarm!

383
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,930
You're starting
to scare the shit
out of me!

384
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,450
All right, let's move.

385
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,490
I covered him out the back.
He's okay.

386
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,080
Let's move, all right?

387
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,690
I never thought
I'd be standing around,
waiting for this cowboy to make it.

388
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,400
Well, you are,

389
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,320
and he will.

390
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,910
You don't have
any doubts, huh?

391
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,700
About our desperado?

392
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,790
About your badge.

393
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,340
Boy. You are
really an asshole,
you know that?

394
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:29,040
Can't get over
the mistake you made.

395
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,880
You've been set up, you know.

396
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,220
By a cop.

397
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,050
That's right.

398
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,350
He's waiting for you right now
at the wrong place.

399
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,890
Me and my friend
don't want to show up.

400
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:48,690
You two hotshots
have both been set up,
haven't you?

401
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,650
You know what always
amazed me about you?

402
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:56,110
A guy with your attitude
never carries a gun.

403
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,030
That's stupid.

404
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,910
Very stupid.

405
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,170
I want a room.
One night, maybe two.

406
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,250
Five bucks a night.

407
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:47,090
I'm expecting someone.
If she shows, send her right up.

408
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,560
Hey, you want a TV?
It's a dollar extra.

409
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,190
Get on over and keep your eye
on our little lady.

410
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,520
Right.

411
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,990
Forget it. I'll put an A.P.B. Out
on all of them.

412
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,900
No, you won't.

413
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,490
What the hell
are you talking about?

414
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,080
It's tough doing business
with lowlifes.

415
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,660
They're unreliable.

416
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,710
But we got a few moves left.

417
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,670
Just, uh, makes the game
a little more interesting, that's all.

418
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,010
Yeah, well, I've been
watching your moves.

419
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,670
I gotta tell you,
I'm not all that impressed.

420
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,760
No shit?

421
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,180
No shit.

422
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,890
We got a mutiny
with this man here.

423
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,770
Shit.
Wait a second.

424
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,020
Now you're still on my team,

425
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,190
and I am your manager.

426
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,610
You do exactly
what I tell you to do, got it?

427
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,950
Suit yourself.

428
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,030
Now you're talking.

429
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,840
What about the other two?

430
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,090
I haven't seen them.

431
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,720
You better stay
out of sight for a while.

432
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,430
There's a cop trying
to put this one on me.

433
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,060
The money's hot.
I wanna trade it in.

434
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,520
Exchange rate's four-to-one at best.

435
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,190
I'll take it.

436
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,900
The train station, 9:00.

437
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,610
That sandwich counter
by the lockers.

438
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,870
I don't like it.

439
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,580
I didn't think you would.

440
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,540
I'll set it up,

441
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,960
but they won't do it
if you're there.

442
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,970
Tonight you'll be hotter
than the cash.

443
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,720
I'll get somebody.

444
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,720
Keep your eye out
for those other two.

445
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,480
They'll know
I have their money.

446
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,730
I told you, I'm not gonna
get killed for you.

447
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,010
Room 3004.

448
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,840
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him.

449
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,980
Just tell me what you want.

450
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,230
I just set things up.

451
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,490
It's his business
what happens after that.

452
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,330
If it was jewelry or bonds,
he might come to me.

453
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,330
But with cash,
he doesn't need me.

454
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,510
I won't see him till the next one.

455
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,630
In a hotel downtown.

456
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,840
The Doran.

457
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,220
The money's in a locker
at the train station.

458
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,230
9:00 he's trading
for smaller bills.

459
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,480
That's all.

460
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,580
I warned him.

461
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,120
I told him I wouldn't
get killed for him.

462
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,380
Sure.

463
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,600
You don't have to play.

464
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:58,770
Everything goes all right,
I'll have your money
by tomorrow morning.

465
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,860
I'll see it through.

466
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,080
I think you're crazy.

467
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,170
Put the key
in a safe-deposit box
for six months,

468
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,290
then go get the money.

469
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:22,050
I'm on a streak.
I'm gonna play it out.

470
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:24,130
I'm gonna get it tonight.

471
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,720
I know all about streaks.

472
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,930
Every player says,
"This time is different."

473
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,560
Maybe we are alike.

474
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,190
No.

475
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,190
When I lose, I just go broke.

476
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,320
You go to jail.

477
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,120
If it wasn't for that cop,
I'd tell you to go ahead.

478
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,120
He's the reason
I've got the rush on.

479
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:58,250
You don't care about the money.

480
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:00,920
Might even send it to him.

481
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,130
Sucker's game.

482
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:12,010
You think... maybe...

483
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,810
you could wait for a while?

484
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,690
Coffee.

485
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,800
I'll be right back
for my change.

486
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,580
Ah, he's about 27, 28 years old.
He's a punk.

487
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,520
Looks like they just switched keys.

488
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,230
Yeah. He's going back
to the lockers right now.

489
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,860
He's wearing
one of those cowboy suits.

490
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,190
He's got a beard...
a real sleaze-O.

491
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,690
He's exchanging the bag.

492
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,700
Black attaché case.

493
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,030
Yeah, dirty money for clean.

494
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,530
Yeah. He's moving...
headed for the platform.

495
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:40,410
He's coming your way.
Right. I'll stick with him.

496
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,910
Shit!

497
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:53,280
Look at your bag, pal?
All right. There's
just some papers in it.

498
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,860
We'll see.

499
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:06,210
How about you, bub?
Yeah. Go ahead.
Take a look.

500
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:15,570
Yeah?
Police.

501
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:18,190
We're checking
all the luggage.
Just a minute.

502
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,280
Not just a minute. Now!

503
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:48,390
Hey. What the hell
are you trying to...

504
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,480
Is that yours?
It's not mine.

505
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,060
Yours?

506
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,190
Is that yours?
Look, man, I'm cool.

507
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,780
Is it yours?
No!

508
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,360
Do you have one?
Yeah. It's up here.

509
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:03,620
Where is it? Where?
It's gone!

510
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:06,160
Was it light brown?
Yeah, that's right, man.

511
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,180
You okay, lady?

512
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,280
A man took my purse.

513
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,070
He's got the key.

514
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,080
He ran to the other side
of the station.

515
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,430
There!

516
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:58,480
All right.
We got trouble. Go!

517
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,520
Go, go!

518
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:26,230
Aaah!

519
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:29,700
Let's get out of here!

520
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,640
- Look out! Look out!
- Aaah!

521
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,560
Give up.

522
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:52,220
I just did the driving.

523
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,430
I ain't got no part in anything else.

524
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,130
Go home.

525
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,970
You okay?

526
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,770
Yeah.

527
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:29,310
I'll see you in a couple of minutes.

528
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:41,840
Gotcha.

529
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,570
What happened?

530
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:00,700
Looks like
we both got swindled.

531
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:05,200
Looks like we both got ripped off
by the exchange man.

532
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,290
Lot of crooks
around these days.

533
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:28,270
Driver?

534
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,480
Sure you don't wanna keep this?

535
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,830
Here.
