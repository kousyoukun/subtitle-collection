Hello, Peter. What's happening?

33
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,189
Uh, we have sort of a problem here.

34
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:30,278
Yeah, you apparently didn't put one of the new cover sheets on your T.P.S. reports.

35
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:34,031
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. I-I forgot.

36
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:36,075
Mmm, yeah.

37
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:40,621
You see, we're putting the cover sheets on all T.P.S. reports now before they go out.

38
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:43,416
Did you see the memo about this?

39
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,421
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I have the memo right here. I just, uh, forgot.

40
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:52,300
But it's not shipping out till tomorrow, so there's no problem.

41
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:54,135
Yeah.

42
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:58,931
if you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that would be great.

43
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:02,101
And, uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo.

44
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,353
- Mm-kay? bye-bye, Peter. - Yeah, no, I have the memo.

00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,355

[ Lumbergh ] Hello, Phil. What's happening?

- [ Mumbling ] - Milton?

49
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:23,664
Hi. Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit?

50
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:26,667
Well, I-I was told that I could listen to the radio...

51
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:28,669
at a reasonable volume from 9:00 to 1 1 :00.

52
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:32,006
Yeah, no, no, I know you're allowed to. I, uh--

53
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,717
I was just thinking maybe like, you know, a personal favor, you--

54
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:40,222
Well, I-I told Bill that if-if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones...

55
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:43,142
while she's-- while she's filing, then I should be able to listen...

56
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,102
- to the radio while I'm collating. - Uh-huh.

57
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:47,271
So, I don't see why I should have to turn down the radio.

58
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:49,857
- Yeah, all right. Okay. - Because I enjoy listening...

59
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:52,860
- at a reasonable volume from 9:00 to 1 1 :00. - Thanks, Milton.

60
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:54,653
Hi, Peter.

61
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:59,241
What's happening? We need to talk about your T.P.S. reports.

62
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,786
Yeah, the cover sheet. I know. I know.

63
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,205
- Uh, Bill talked to me about it. - Yeah.

64
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,499
- Did you get that memo? - Yeah, I got the memo.

65
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:11,837
And I understand the policy and the problem is just that I forgot the one time.

66
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:14,298
I've already taken care of it, so it's not really a problem anymore.

67
00:06:14,383 --> 00:06:18,803
Ah, yeah. It's just we're putting new cover sheets...

68
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:21,389
on all the T.P.S. reports before they go out now.

69
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:26,310
So, if you could go ahead and try to remember to do that from now on, that'd be great.

70
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,479
All right!

- Peter Gibbons. - [ Man ] Yeah. Peter?

72
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:44,203
- Yes. - Did you get the memo about the T.P.S. reports?

73
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,163
I have the memo.

74
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:50,042
- [ Whirring, Beeping ] - No, not again.

- Bolton? - That's me.

83
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,489
Wow. Is that your real name?

84
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:24,910
- Yeah. [ Clears Throat ] - So, are you related to that singer guy?

85
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:27,830
- No, it's just a coincidence. - Oh.

86
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,249
[ Mutters ] Yeah, you fuckin' cow.

87
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,960
No one in this country can ever pronounce my name right.

88
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:37,047
I-It's not that hard-- Nagheenanajar. Nagheenanajar.

89
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:40,217
Yeah, well, at least your name isn't Michael Bolton.

90
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,303
You know, there's nothing wrong with that name.

91
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:45,806
There was nothing wrong with it, until I was about 1 2 years old...

92
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:49,643
and that no-talent ass clown became famous and started winning Grammys.

93
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:54,690
Hmm. Why don't-- Why don't you just, uh, go by Mike instead of Michael?

94
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,901
No way. Why should I change? He's the one who sucks.

95
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,904
- Hey, guys. - What's up, G.?

96
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:03,449
- Wanna go to Chotchkie's, get some cof fee? - Oh, it's a little early.

97
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,826
I gotta get out of here. I think I'm gonna lose it.

98
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:09,997
Uh-oh. Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.

99
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:17,546
Boy, I tell you. Some days.

100
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,299

[ Imitates Machine Gun, Laughs ]

102
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:26,305
So, can I get you gentlemen something more to drink, or maybe something to nibble on?

103
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,891
Some pizza shooters, shrimp poppers or extreme fajitas?

104
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,976
Just cof fee.

105
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,938
Okay. Sounds like a case of the Mondays. [ Chuckles ]

106
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:41,779
What ifwe're still doing this when we're 50?

107
00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:44,448
It would be nice to have that kind of job security.

108
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:48,702
Lumbergh's gonna have me work on Saturday. I-I can tell already.

109
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:52,873
I'm gonna end up doing it because, uh-- because I'm a big pussy.

110
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,917
Which is why I work at Initech to begin with.

111
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:59,213
Yeah, well, I work at Initech, and I don't consider myself a pussy. Okay?

112
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:01,674
Yes, I am also not a pussy.

113
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,717
They're gonna find out the hard way I'm not a pussy...

114
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:06,720
- if they don't start treating their software people better. - That's right.

115
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:10,516
I don't understand. I could program a virus that would rip that place of f big-time.

116
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,477
- Yeah. - Big-time.

117
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,566
- Whoa. - There she is.

118
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,986
Peter, you know, you always talk about this girl.

119
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,405
if you're so obsessed with her, why don't you just ask her out?

120
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,866
No, I can't do that. I'm just another asshole customer.

121
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:31,036
You can'tjust walk up to a waitress and ask her out.

122
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,414
Besides, I'm still trying to work it out with Anne.

123
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:36,417
Uh, that reminds me. I'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday.

124
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,920
- Why not? - I'm gonna see this, uh...

125
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,880
occupational hypnotherapist with Anne.

126
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:45,342
- Dude, an occupational hypnotherapist? - Yeah, I know.

127
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:50,848
Anne wants me to go. She thinks it might help. I'm--

128
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:53,183
You know,
sometimes I think Ia”

129
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:55,936
I get thinking that she's cheating on me.

130
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:58,480
- Yeah, I know what you mean. - Yeah.

131
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,359
What is that supposed to mean?

132
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,862
Nothing.

133
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:08,157
Look. Just tell Anne that you're not into hypnosis and you wanna play poker.

134
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,993
No, I can't do that. She'll get all pissed of f.

135
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,996
And, besides, I think that the guy might actually be able to help.

136
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,998
I mean, he did help Anne lose weight.

137
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,250
Peter, she's anorexic.

138
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,503
Yeah, I know. The guy's really good.

139
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,506
Yeah, well, I don't think any occupational hypnotherapist...

140
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,967
is gonna help you solve any of your problems.

141
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:28,761
Okay? Hey, and speaking of problems...

142
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,180
what's this I hear about you having problems with your T.P.S. reports?

143
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,308
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

144
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,980
- Hey! Hey, guys! Peter! - Is that Smykowski?

145
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:42,024
- Samir! - [ Samir ] What's he doing?

146
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,068
Oh, probably working on another heart attack.

147
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:46,987
I've been looking all over for you guys. Have you seen this?

148
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:50,199
- I knew it. I knew it. - What? It's a staff meeting. So what?

149
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:54,620
So what? We're all screwed, that's what. They're gonna downsize Initech.

150
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,747
What are you talking about, Tom? How do you know that?

151
00:10:56,831 --> 00:11:00,042
How do I know? They're bringing in a consultant, that's how I know.

152
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,044
That's what this staff meeting is all about.

153
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,213
It happened at Initrode last year.

154
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,800
You have to interview with this consultant. They call them "efficiency experts."

155
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,177
But what you're really doing is interviewing for your own job.

156
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:12,805
[ Michael ] Every week you say you're going to lose your job, and you're still here.

157
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,474
[ Tom ] Not this time. I bet I'm the first one laid of f.

158
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:19,728
The thought of having to go to the state unemployment of fice, to stand in line with scumbags!

159
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,648
Shit.

160
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:26,694
You know, there are people in this world that don't have to put up with all this shit.

161
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:29,697
Like that guy that invented the Pet Rock?

162
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:32,950
You see, that's what you have to do.

163
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,952
You have to use your mind...

164
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,788
and come up with some really great idea like that.

165
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:39,873
And you can make millions. Never have to work again.

166
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,875
You think the Pet Rock was a really great idea?

167
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,338
Sure it was. The guy made a million dollars.

168
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:53,512
You know, I had an idea like that once, a long time ago.

169
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,514
Really? What was it, Tom?

170
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:58,183
Well, all right.

171
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:02,146
It was a "jump to conclusions" mat.

172
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:06,108
You see, it would be this mat...

173
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,360
that you would put on the floor...

174
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:13,198
and it would have different conclusions written on it...

175
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:15,617
that you could jump to.

176
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,291
That is the worst idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

177
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,044
Yes. Yes, it's horrible, this idea.

178
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,467
Uh, look, I gotta get outta here.

179
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,719
I'll see you guys later...

180
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:37,347
- if I still have a job. - Yeah.

181
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:40,726
Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do...

182
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,770
if you had a million dollars, didn't have to work.

183
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:46,106
And, invariably, whatever you'd say, that was supposed to be your career.

184
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:49,526
if you wanted to fix old cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.

185
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:53,280
- So what did you say? - I never had an answer.

186
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,282
I guess that's why I'm working at Initech.

187
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,827
No. You're working at Initech 'cause that question is bullshit to begin with.

188
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,871
If everyone listened to her, there'd be no janitors...

189
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:04,124
because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars.

190
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,210
You know what I would do if I had million dollars?

191
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:09,171
I would invest half of it in low-risk mutual funds...

192
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,633
and then take the other half of it to my friend Asadulah, who works in securities--

193
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:15,344
Samir. Samir, you're missing the point. The point of the exercise...

194
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,973
- is that you're supposed to figure out what you would want to do if-- - [ Beeps ]

195
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,851
"P.C. load letter"? What the fuck does that mean?

196
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,686
What the--

197
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,668
[ Man ] Hey, Peter, man! Check out channel 9!

198
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:50,671
- Check out this chick! - Damn it, Lawrence.

199
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:53,674
Can't you just pretend like we can't hear each other through the wall?

200
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,175
Oh, sorry, man! Anne over there or somethin'?

201
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,764
No, but... if you wanna talk to me, just come over.

202
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,145
Hey, man. Check this out, dude.

203
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:13,193
[ Woman ] The key is early detection. Tumors that are detected--

204
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,030
- Aw, geez, Lawrence. - I'm sorry, man. I thought you'd want to see this.

205
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:19,616
Doesn't that chick look like Anne?

206
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:22,536
Yeah. A little bit. Ia”

207
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,873
Hey, she hasn't been over here in a while. You two still goin' out?

208
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:29,126
Yeah. I guess. I-I don't know.

209
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,545
Sometimes I get the feeling like she's cheating on me.

210
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,755
Yeah. I get that feeling too, man.

211
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,717
What do you mean by that?

212
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:39,177
I don't know, man.

213
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,430
I just get that feeling lookin' at her, like...

214
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,807
she's the type of chick that would just--

215
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,356
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Look, I-Ia”

216
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:54,026
You know, I'm talkin' outta my ass. I don't know nothin'.

217
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,029
Forget it. Don't worry. It's all right. Just-- I had a rough day.

218
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,657
Tell me about it, man. [ Groans ]

219
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:05,787
I gotta wake my ass up at 6:00 a.m. every day this week...

220
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,789
drag up to Las Clindas.

221
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,626
Yeah. I'm doin' the drywall up there at the new McDonald's.

222
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,712
Let me ask you something.

223
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:16,089
When you come in on Monday and you're not feelin' real well...

224
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:19,843
does anyone ever say to you, "Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays"?

225
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,639
No.

226
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,641
No, man.

227
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,517
Shit, no, man.

228
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:30,228
I believe you'd get your ass kicked, sayin' somethin' like that, man.

229
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:33,523
- Huh. - We still goin' fishin' this weekend?

230
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:36,443
Nah, Lumbergh's gonna have me come in on Saturday. I just know it.

231
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,445
Well, you can get out of that easily.

232
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:40,405
Yeah? How?

233
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,240
Well...

234
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:44,785
when a boss wants you to work on a Saturday...

235
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:48,163
- he generally asks you at the end of the day, right? - Yeah.

236
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,832
So all you gotta do is avoid him-- That's all right. I got it--

237
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,628
on the last dew hours on Friday, duck out early...

238
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:58,548
turn of fyour answering machine, you should be home free, man.

239
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:02,094
That's a really good idea.

240
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,137
Fuckin'-A, man.

241
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:09,768
Lawrence, what would you do if you had a million dollars?

242
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:13,021
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

243
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,065
Two chicks at the same time, man.

244
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,654
That's it?

245
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:24,408
if you had a million dollars, y-you'd do two chicks at the same time?

246
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:27,369
Damn straight. I've always wanted to do that, man.

247
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,122
I think if I were a millionaire, I could hook that up too.

248
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:33,375
- 'Cause chicks dig dudes with money. - Well, not all chicks.

249
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,211
Well, the type of chicks that would double up on a dude like me do.

250
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,296
- Good point. - Well, what about you now

251
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:40,882
- What would you do? - Besides two chicks at the same time?

252
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,760
- Well, yeah. - Nothing.

253
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,887
Nothin', huh?

254
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,181
I would relax.

255
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,685
I would sit on my ass all day.

256
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,645
I would do nothing.

257
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,398
Well, you don't nEED a million dollars to do nothin', man.

258
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,901
Take a look at my cousin. He's broke, don't do shit.

259
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:07,367
[ Nina's Voice ] Crporate Accounts Payable. Nina speaking. Just a moment.

260
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:09,703
Crporate Accounts Payable. Nina speaking.

261
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:11,872
Just a moment.

262
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:14,416
Crporate Accounts Payable. Nina speaking.

263
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,626
Just a moment.

264
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:19,838
[ Lumbergh ] So, you should ask your self:

265
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:23,050
With every decision you make, is this good for the company?

266
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:26,470
- Am I helping with-- - Is that the guy?

267
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:28,805
Yeah. We're screwed.

268
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,309
Okay, then, um--

269
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:37,397
I'd like to go ahead and welcome, uh, a new member to our team here.

270
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:41,651
This is, uh, Bob Slydell.

271
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:45,238
Yeah. Uh--

272
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:47,407
Bob is a consultant.

273
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:52,704
Yeah. He's gonna be sort of , uh...

274
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:55,373
helping us out a little here...

275
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,376
asking some questions, maybe seeing ifthere are some ways...

276
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:02,214
we can make things run a little more smoothly around here.

277
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,635
Yeah. Oh, and remember...

278
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,888
next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day.

279
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:15,519
So, you know, if you want to, go ahead and, uh...

280
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:18,355
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

281
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:21,233
And I said I don't care if they lay me of f, either.

282
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:25,028
Because I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time...

283
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:27,739
then I'm-- I'm quitting-- I'm going to quit.

284
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:32,786
And I told Dom too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year.

285
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,955
And I used to be over by the window...

286
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,291
and I could see the squirrels, and they were married.

287
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:41,670
But then they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler.

288
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,798
But I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much...

289
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:47,509
and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler.

290
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,803
- Okay, Milton. - [ Milton On Phone ] And, oh, no, it's not okay...

291
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:53,014
because if they make me-- if they take my stapler...

292
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,977
then I'll-- I'll have to-- I'll set the building on fire.

293
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,020
Okay, well, that sounds, uh-- that sounds great.

294
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,107
- Uh, I'll talk to you later, all right? Bye. - [ Milton Stammering ]

295
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,109
Oh.

296
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,113
Yeah.

297
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:20,250
Good-bye.

298
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:43,106
Come on.

299
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,444
Oh, for cryin'--

300
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,551
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

301
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:15,263
Um... I'm gonna nEED you...

302
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,225
to go ahead and come in tomorrow.

303
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,728
So if you could be here around...

304
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:23,939
9:00, that would be great.

305
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,941
Mm-kay?

306
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:28,902
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

307
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:33,573
Uh, I'm also gonna need you to go ahead and come in...

308
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:36,243
on Sunday too, 'kay?

309
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:39,788
We, um, lost some people this week...

310
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:43,333
and, uh, we nEED to sort of play catch-up.

311
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,335
Thanks.

312
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:52,467
[ Peter ] So I was sitting in my cubicle today, and I realized...

313
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:56,137
ever since I started working, um...

314
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:59,140
every single day of my life has been worse than...

315
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,726
the day before it.

316
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:05,981
So that means that every single day that you see me...

317
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,024
that's on the worst day of my life.

318
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,569
What about today? Is today the worst day of your life?

319
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:14,322
- Yeah. - Wow. That's messed up.

320
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,995
I'm sorry. Go on.

321
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,832
Is there any way that you could sort of ...

322
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:28,962
just zonk me out so that, like, I don't know that I'm at work... in here?

323
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:33,008
Culd I come home and think that I've been fishing all day, or something?

324
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:36,761
That's... really not what I do, Peter.

325
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:39,347
[ Chuckles ] However...

326
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:43,727
the good news is, I think I can help you.

327
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:46,313
I want you to do something for me, Peter.

328
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:50,734
I want you to try and relax.

329
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:56,448
I want you to relax every muscle in your body...

330
00:21:56,532 --> 00:22:01,077
beginning with your toes to your fingertips.

331
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,042
Now, I want you to relax your legs.

332
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,462
You're beginning to feel your eyelids getting heavy...

333
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:13,340
as you slip deeper and deeper...

334
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:16,468
into a state of complete relaxation.

335
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:20,722
All your cares and concerns are disappearing.

336
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,309
Deeper and deeper. Way down.

337
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:27,354
your concern about your job...

338
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:29,606
melts away...

339
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,485
way, way down.

340
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:38,990
Now, when I count backwards from three...

341
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:42,494
you'll be in a state of complete relaxation.

342
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:45,830
your worries, cares and inhibitions will be gone...

343
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:48,917
and you will remain in that state...

344
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,753
until I snap my fingers.

345
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:55,090
Three. Deeper and deeper.

346
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:58,343
Way, way down.

347
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:02,472
Two. Deeper and deeper.

348
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:05,350
W-W-Way down.

349
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:11,022
[ Labored Breathing ] Whu-- Whu-- One.

350
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,735
[ Gasps ] Oh, my God! Doctor Swanson!

351
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,488
- Ex! Ex! - [ Woman ] Is he breathing?

352
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:21,658
- Call 91 1 ! - Oh! Where's the phone? Where's the goddamn phone?

353
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:23,660
[ Man ] Hurry!

354
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:25,745
- [ Anne ] Peter! - Hurry!

355
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:59,988
Yeah, hi. It's Bill Lumbergh.

356
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,907
It's about... 1 0:00.

357
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:06,619
Yeah. Just, uh, wondering where you are.

358
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,958
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lumbergh again.

359
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,461
Uh, I just wanted to make sure you knew...

360
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:19,966
that we did start at the, uh, usual time this morning.

361
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,052
Yeah. It isn't a half day or anything like that.

362
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:25,054
So, if you could just go ahead...

363
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:29,225
and get here as soon as possible, that would be terrific.

364
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,414
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lum--

365
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:54,792
- Yeah. It's-- - Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lumbergh--

366
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:58,796
Yeah. It's me again. Uh, I was away from my desk for a minute.

367
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:02,050
- [ Phone Rings ] - Just checking in, in case you called while I was gone.

368
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:06,304
- Hello? - [ Anne ] Peter, what's going on?

369
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:11,184
- Huh? - It's 3:30. Why aren't you at work?

370
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:14,395
Because Ia” Ia” I didn't feel like it.

371
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,689
[ Scof fs ] Peter, what's gotten into you?

372
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,983
First, you just sit there while Dr. Swanson dies.

373
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:21,653
Then you just walk out of the car and embarrass me in front of my friends.

374
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:25,240
- Don't blame this on hypnosis, either. That's total bull-- - [ Beeps ]

375
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:31,204
- [ Phone Rings ] - [ Answering Machine Beeps ]

376
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:33,373
[ Anne ] Listen, asshole. Nobody hangs up on me.

377
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:36,918
We're through. Oh, and one more thing.

378
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,087
I've been cheating on you!

379
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:47,262
So, from now on, only use the new time sheets...

380
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:51,641
if you've worked on two or more job codes in one day...

381
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:54,769
and you need the extra columns to fit it all in.

382
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,313
- Otherwise, use the old time sheets-- - Where's Peter?

383
00:25:57,398 --> 00:25:59,315
I heard he didn't show up this weekend.

384
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,068
- Uh, I don't know. - I think this new system will really, really help us out.

385
00:26:02,152 --> 00:26:07,115
- Who the hell is that guy? - So, uh, any questions?

386
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,298
- Hi. I'm Peter. - Hi. Can I help you?

387
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,633
What are you doin' for lunch today?

388
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,511
Uh, well, our specials today are blackened chicken.

389
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,555
And-- It's actually right there on the board. Excuse me.

390
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:35,059
Hey, look who's back!

391
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:38,396
Table for three to--

392
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,649
I was askin' what you were doin' for lunch.

393
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,319
Would you like to have lunch with me?

394
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,404
[ Scof fs ] Are you-- Are you serious?

395
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,406
Yeah.

396
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,618
Yeah. Um, I don't-- I don't think I'm supposed to do that.

397
00:26:51,702 --> 00:26:53,745
Oh. Okay.

398
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:56,289
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'm gonna go next door and get a table.

399
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:59,167
And if you'd like to join me, uh, no big deal, all right?

400
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,169
And if not, that's cool too. Okay?

401
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,756
- Okay. - All right.

402
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,343
When you say, "next door," do you mean Chili's or Flinger's?

403
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,345
Flinger's.

404
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,555
Okay.

405
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:18,269
What you do at Initech is you take the specifications from the customers...

406
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:20,271
and you bring them down to the software engineers.

407
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,315
Yes. Y-Yes. That's-- That's right.

408
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,275
Well, then I just have to ask...

409
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,197
why couldn't the customers just take them directly to the software people, huh?

410
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,742
Well, I'll tell you why.

411
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:37,580
Uh, because... engineers are not good at dealing with customers.

412
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,582
Uh-huh.

413
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:45,004
So, you physically take the specs from the customer?

414
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:47,215
Well--

415
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,844
No. My secretary does that, or they're faxed.

416
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:53,513
Huh.

417
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:56,474
So then you must physically bring them to the software people.

418
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,103
Well... no.

419
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:02,855
I mean, sometimes.

420
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,399
Ah.

421
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:08,403
What would you say you do here?

422
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,114
Well, look, I already told you.

423
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:15,243
I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to.

424
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,955
I have people skills. I am good at dealing with people!

425
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,917
Can't you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you people?

- Bolton? - Yeah.

430
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:44,021
- Is that your real name? - Yeah.

431
00:28:46,483 --> 00:28:48,359
Are you any relation to the pop singer?

432
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:52,071
- No, it's-- it's just a coincidence. - I'll be honest with you.

433
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:55,742
- I love his music. I do. I'm a Michael Bolton fan. - Me too.

434
00:28:55,826 --> 00:29:00,204
I don't know if it gets any better than when he sings "When a Man Loves a Woman."

435
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,206
But you must really love his music, huh?

437
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:07,086
Yeah, he's-- he's-- he's pretty--

438
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:09,922
- He's pretty good, I guess. - You're goddamn right, he is.

439
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,966
- [ Men Laugh ] - Right.

440
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,886
So, tell me. What's your favorite song of his?

441
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,305
Mmm--

442
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:21,058
[ Clears Throat ] I don't-- I don't know.

443
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:24,479
[ Chuckles ] I mean, I guess I sort of like them all.

444
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:27,690
That's a riot. I'm the exact same way.

445
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:30,526
But it must be twice as hard for you, being having the same name as him.

446
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:33,488
I celebrate the guy's entire catalog.

447
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:36,073
Anyway, let's get down to business, Michael.

00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:38,326
You know, you can just call me Mike.

- Hi. - Hey.

00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:51,047
I wonder if I'm allowed to, uh, wear this in here.

451
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:56,010
I think it'll be okay. Would you like to sit down?

452
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,513
Okay.

Yeah. Is it?

Yeah, my God, compared to Chotchkie's!

I like the uniforms better, anyway.

00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:31,838
Ohh! Yeah. That's-- That's, uh--

464
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:35,842
- That's one of my-- my pieces of flair. - What's a piece of flair?

465
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:39,428
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know, like these suspenders...

466
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:42,265
and, uh, the buttons are all sort of --

467
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:46,894
We're actually required to wear, um, 1 5 pieces of flair.

468
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,188
It's really stupid, actually.

469
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:51,983
- Do you get to pick 'em your self? - Yeah, yeah, we do.

470
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,235
Although I didn't actually choose these.

471
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,572
I just sort of grabbed, you know, 1 5 buttons and just--

472
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:00,283
I don't even know what they say. You know, I don't really care.

473
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,660
I don't really like talking about my flair.

474
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,745
- Okay. - So...

475
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,499
- where do you, uh, work, Peter? - Initech.

476
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:10,626
And, yeah, what-- what do you do there?

477
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,754
I sit in a cubicle...

478
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,465
and I update bank software for the 2000 switch.

479
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:21,304
- What's that? - Well, see, they wrote all this bank software...

480
00:31:21,388 --> 00:31:25,308
and, uh, to save space, they used two digits for the date instead of four.

481
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:28,144
So, like, 98 instead of 1 998.

482
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:32,064
Uh, so I go through these thousands of lines of code and, uh--

483
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,609
It doesn't really matter.

484
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,486
I, uh-- I don't like my job, and, uh...

485
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:39,614
I don't think I'm gonna go anymore.

486
00:31:40,908 --> 00:31:43,534
- You're just not gonna go? - Yeah.

487
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:47,121
- Won't you get fired? - I don't know.

488
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,583
But I really don't like it and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

489
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,877
What, so you're gonna quit?

490
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:57,715
Nuh-uh. Not really. Uh-- I'm just gonna stop going.

491
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,429
Uh, when did you decide all of that?

492
00:32:03,513 --> 00:32:05,431
- About an hour ago. - Oh, really.

493
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:08,100
- Yeah. - About an hour ago.

494
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:10,061
So you're gonna get another job?

495
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:12,271
I don't think I'd like another job.

496
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:16,192
Well, what are you going to do about money and bills and--

497
00:32:16,276 --> 00:32:18,903
You know, I've never really liked paying bills.

498
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:21,322
I don't think I'm gonna do that, either.

499
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:25,701
Uh, well, so what do you wanna do?

500
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:27,828
I wanna take you out to dinner...

501
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:30,164
and then I want to go back to my apartment and watch Kung Fu

502
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,500
Do you ever watch Kung Fu?

503
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:36,295
- I love Kung Fu. - Channel 39.

504
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,674
- Totally. - You should come over and watch KungFu tonight.

505
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,676
- Okay. - Great.

506
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,678
Okay. Can we order lunch first?

507
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,388
- Yeah. - Okay.

508
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,234
Not working out.

509
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:03,072
Took a stapler of f my desk--

510
00:33:09,746 --> 00:33:12,665
Anyway, sounds great, Bob. See you in a few.

511
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:17,586
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

512
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:20,715
- I'm sorry? - Um, I'm going to have to ask you...

513
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,009
to go ahead and move your desk again.

514
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:25,553
- Eh-- What? No. - So, if you could go ahead...

515
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,264
and get it as far back against that wall as possible...

516
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:31,183
- that would be great. - No, no, because I was--

517
00:33:31,268 --> 00:33:33,269
- I was told I no longer-- - That way, we'll have some room...

518
00:33:33,353 --> 00:33:35,688
for some of these boxes and things we nEED to put in here.

519
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:37,898
- There's no room. - And, uh--

520
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,776
Oh. Oh, there it is.

521
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:44,196
- What? - Here, let me just go ahead and get that from you.

522
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:47,575
- [ Moans ] - Great.

523
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,745
- [ Whimpering ] - So if you could just get to that...

524
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:54,874
as soon as possible, that would be terrific. Mm-kay?

525
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:57,668
- Thanks a bunch, Milton. Good-bye. - But--

526
00:33:57,753 --> 00:34:00,796
Well, okay, but...

527
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:03,299
I could set the building on fire.

528
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,387
- Peter. - Michael.

529
00:34:08,472 --> 00:34:11,766
What the hell's going on, man? I thought you were gonna come in here and start shooting.

530
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,186
No. I just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay.

531
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,938
- I got a phone number, Mike, that I don't wanna lose. - What?

532
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,483
Peter, you're in deep shit. You were supposed to come in on Saturday.

533
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:24,945
- What were you doing? - Michael, I did nothing.

534
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,408
I did absolutely nothing, and it was everything that I thought it could be.

535
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:32,119
I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh.

536
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,747
You're supposed to be having your interview right now with the consultants.

537
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:37,166
- The who? - The consultants.

538
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,168
What has gotten into you?

539
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:44,423
Oh, yeah. Right.

540
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:46,759
Wait, Peter. Peter. You gotta postpone it, man.

541
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:48,761
Tell 'em you've been sick. Make something up.

542
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:50,846
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

543
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:53,182
It's the best day of my life.

544
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:57,311
Next batter looks like a Peter Gibbons.

545
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,939
- Uh-huh. - Ah, there you are.

546
00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:02,441
We were just talking about you. You must be Peter Gibbons.

547
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:06,112
Uh-huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell. This is my associate Bob Porter.

548
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:08,114
Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

549
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:12,118
Why don't you go ahead and grab a seat and join us for a minute or two.

550
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:15,704
You see, what we're actually trying to do here is we're just--

551
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:19,291
We're trying to get a feel for how people spend their day at work.

552
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:24,713
So, if you would, would you walk us through a typical day for you?

553
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:27,633
- Yeah. - Great.

554
00:35:27,717 --> 00:35:31,137
Well, I generally come in at least 1 5 minutes late.

555
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:34,140
Uh, I use the side door.

556
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:36,559
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

557
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:38,602
And, uh-- And after that...

558
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:40,855
I just sort of space out for about an hour.

559
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:44,650
- Uh, "space out"? - Yeah.

560
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:48,070
I just stare at my desk, but it looks like I'm working.

561
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:52,241
I do that for, uh, probably another hour after lunch too.

562
00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:55,828
I'd say in a given week, I probably only do about 1 5 minutes...

563
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:58,622
of real, actual work.

564
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,169
Uh, Peter, would you be a good sport...

565
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:06,547
and indulge us and just... tell us a little more?

566
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:11,719
Oh, yeah. Let me tell you something about T.P.S. reports.

567
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,721
[ Chuckles ]

568
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:18,851
The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's that I just don't care.

569
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:20,853
Don't-- Don't care?

570
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:23,564
It's a problem of motivation, all right?

571
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:27,067
Now, if I work my ass of f and Initech ships a dew extra units...

572
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:30,571
I don't see another dime, so where's the motivation?

573
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,282
And here's something else, Bob.

574
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:35,284
I have eight different bosees right now.

575
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:37,620
- I beg your pardon? Eight? - Eight bosses Eight, Bob.

576
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:41,040
So that means that when I make a mistake...

577
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:44,126
I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it.

578
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:47,504
That's my only real morivation is not to be hassled.

579
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,506
That and the fear of losing my job.

580
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:53,636
But you know, Bob, that'll only make someone workjust hard enough not to get fired.

581
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,513
Would you bear with me forjust a second, please?

582
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:58,641
Okay.

583
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:01,644
What if-- and believe me...

584
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:04,730
this is so hypothetical--

585
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:08,567
but what if you were of fered some kind of a stock oprion...

586
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:10,569
equity-sharing program?

587
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:12,821
- Would that do anything for you? - I don't know. I guess.

588
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:17,368
Listen, I'm gonna go. Uh, it's been really nice talking to both of you guys.

589
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:21,247
Absolutely. The pleasure's all on this side of the table, trust me.

590
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,750
Good luck with your layof fs, all right? I hope your firings go really well.

591
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:27,711
- Okay. Great. Wow. - Thanks a lot.

592
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,596
So, Peter, what's happening?

593
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:39,723
Listen, uh--

594
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:48,941
Joanna, would you come here a minute, please?

595
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,943
Yeah.

596
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:55,030
I'm sorry I was late, but I was having lunch and I, uh--

597
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:57,449
We need to talk about your flair.

598
00:37:57,534 --> 00:38:01,829
Really? I-I have 1 5 pieces on. I also--

599
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:06,375
- Well, 1 5 is the minimum, okay? - Oh. Okay.

600
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:09,003
Now, you know, it's up to you whether or not...

601
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,463
you wanna just do the bare minimum or, uh--

602
00:38:11,548 --> 00:38:16,176
Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair on today.

603
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:19,930
- And a terrific smile. - Okay, so you want me to wear more?

604
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:23,851
- Look, Joanna-- - Yeah?

605
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,978
People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, okay?

606
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:28,939
They come to Chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attitude.

607
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:31,734
Okay? That's what the flair's about. It's about fun.

608
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:35,070
Yeah. Okay, so more then, yeah?

609
00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:40,034
Look, we want you to express yourself. Okay?

610
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:44,496
Now, if you feel that the bare minimum is enough, then okay.

611
00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:49,376
But some people choose to wear more and we encourage that. Okay?

612
00:38:50,754 --> 00:38:52,713
You do wanna express yourself, don't you?

613
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:56,342
- Y-Yeah. - Okay, great, great.

614
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:58,427
That's all I ask.

615
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,095
Okay.

616
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:05,017
Right, so there's three more people we can easily lose.

617
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:08,270
And then there's Tom Smykowski.

618
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:10,314
He's useless.

619
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:13,609
- Gone. - Sounds good to me.

620
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:17,363
Here's a peculiar-- Uh, Milton Waddams.

621
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:19,323
- Who's he? - You know, squirrely-looking guy.

622
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,408
- Mumbles a lot. - Oh, yeah.

623
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:25,954
Yeah, we-- we can't actually find a record of him being a current employee here.

624
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,792
I looked into it more deeply, and I found that apparently what happened...

625
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:33,712
is that he was laid of f five years ago, and no one ever told him about it.

626
00:39:33,797 --> 00:39:37,633
But through some kind of glitch in the payroll department, he still gets a paycheck.

627
00:39:37,717 --> 00:39:40,552
So we just went ahead and fixed the glitch.

628
00:39:40,637 --> 00:39:43,138
- Great. - So, uh, Milton has been let go.

629
00:39:43,223 --> 00:39:45,391
Well, just a second there, prof essor.

630
00:39:45,475 --> 00:39:49,269
We, uh-- We fixed the glitch...

631
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,397
so he won't be receiving a paycheck anymore...

632
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:53,899
so it'll just work itself out naturally.

633
00:39:53,983 --> 00:39:56,318
We always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible.

634
00:39:56,403 --> 00:39:58,320
The problem is solved from your end.

635
00:39:58,405 --> 00:40:03,033
Um, I'd like to move us right along to a Peter Gibbons.

636
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:05,911
Now, we had a chance to meet this young man...

637
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:08,122
and, boy, that's just a straight shooter...

638
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,124
with upper management written all over him.

639
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,960
[ Inhales ] Ooh.

640
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,921
Yeah. Um--

641
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:19,508
I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with you there.

642
00:40:19,592 --> 00:40:22,136
Yeah, uh, he's been real flaky lately...

643
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,306
and I'm just not sure that he's the caliber person...

644
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,308
that we would want for upper management.

645
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:33,021
He's also been having some problems with his T.P.S. reports.

646
00:40:34,023 --> 00:40:36,483
I'll handle this.

647
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,944
We feel...

648
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:40,946
that the problem isn't with Peter.

649
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,948
Mm-mmm.

650
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:46,702
It's that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really motivated.

651
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:48,996
There it is.

652
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,665
Yeah, uh, well...

653
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,001
I'm just not sure about that right now.

654
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,171
Yeah, Bill, let me ask you a real quick question here.

655
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,215
How much time would you say you spend each week...

656
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,718
dealing with these T.P.S. reports?

657
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:10,017

So, Peter, what's happening?

693
00:43:31,326 --> 00:43:34,620
Uh, now, are you going to go ahead...

694
00:43:34,704 --> 00:43:38,582
and have those T.P.S. reports for us this afternoon?

00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:40,917
No.

Ah, yeah.

697
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:48,717
So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk, hmm?

698
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:51,803
Not right now, Lumbergh. I'm-- I'm kinda busy.

699
00:43:51,888 --> 00:43:56,892
In fact, I'm going to have to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time.

700
00:43:56,976 --> 00:43:59,519
I got a meeting with the Bobs in a couple minutes.

701
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,649
Uh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.

702
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:05,901
Yeah, they called me at home.

703

That sounds good, Peter.

And, uh, we'll go ahead and get this all fixed up for you.

705
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:17,412
Great.

my paycheck this week.
I was-- I-Ia” I didn't receive

Uh, you're going to have to talk to Payroll about that.

709
00:44:33,513 --> 00:44:35,472
I did and they said--

710
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:40,477
Milt, we're going to need to go ahead and move you downstairs into storage "B."

711
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:44,022
- No, I-I was told I could not-- - We have some new people coming in...

712
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:46,483
- No. There's-- - and we nEED all the space we can get.

713
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:49,236
- But there's no space-- - So if you could just go ahead...

714
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,490
- and pack up yourstuff, and move it down there... - [ Stammering ]

00:44:56,577 --> 00:44:58,620
Excuse me.

717
00:44:58,705 --> 00:45:04,251
I believe you have my stapler, please. Mmm.

718
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,628
Looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.

719
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:10,215
- I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob. - [ Laughing ]

720
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:13,385
- Good one. - Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

721
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:16,555
I-I'm sure you've-- you've heard some of the rumors...

722
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,891
circulating around the hallways about how we're going to be doing...

723
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:22,602
a little "housecleaning" with some of the software people.

724
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:25,856
Well, Bob, I have heard that, and you gotta do what you gotta do.

725
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,941
We're gonna be getting rid of these people here.

726
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,403
First, Mr. Samir Naga--

727

- He-- He-- - Naga--

728
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:37,367
- Naga-- Not gonna work here anymore anyway. - [ Laughing ]

729
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:40,871
And Mr. Mike Bolton. Nobody's gonna miss him.

730
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:42,622
You're gonna lay of f Samir and Michael?

731
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,459
Ah, yeah, we're gonna bring in some entry-level graduates.

732
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,461
Farm some work out to Singapore. That's the usual deal.

733
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:50,922
- It's standard operating procedure. - Do they know this yet?

734
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:53,341
No. No, of course not.

735
00:45:53,426 --> 00:45:56,303
We find it's always better to fire people on a Friday.

736
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:59,222
Studies have statistically shown that there's less chance of an incident...

737
00:45:59,307 --> 00:46:01,892
if you do it at the end of the week.

738
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:05,228
Peter, what we'd like to do is put you into position...

739
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:10,192
to have as many as four people working right underneath you.

740
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:13,445
- This is a big promotion, Pete. - Iy's huge.

741
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:17,032
So you're going to fire Michael and Samir and you're going to give me more money?

742
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:22,996
- Hmm? - Wow!

743
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:27,125
Hmm. Yeah. That's it.

744
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,128
That's exactly what I need. Uh-huh. Give it to me.

745
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:32,631
Cme on, you little fucker. Let's go. That's what I need.

746
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:35,842
Let's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little fuck--

747
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,220
- Michael. - Hey.

748
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:40,889
Listen to me.

749
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:44,309
What are you doing tonight?

750
00:46:44,393 --> 00:46:48,021
Michael, there comes a point in a man's life...

751
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,733
and maybe that time for you is now...

752
00:46:51,818 --> 00:46:55,320
when it doesn't hurt to start thinking about the future.

753
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:59,616
Uh, no of fense there, Peter, but speak for yourself there, sport.

754
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,577
I'm not the one who's been flakin' out at work.

755
00:47:02,662 --> 00:47:06,498
I know you had this religious experience or whatever the hell that was...

756
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:10,252
but you'd better snap out of it and get yourshit together, or you're gonna get canned.

757
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:13,839
Yeah, and, uh-- and l-- Listen.

758
00:47:13,923 --> 00:47:16,007
That virus you're always talking about, right?

759
00:47:16,092 --> 00:47:19,469
The one that could rip of fthe company for a bunch of money.

760
00:47:19,554 --> 00:47:22,472
- Yeah, what about it? - Well, how does it work?

761
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:25,183
It's pretty brilliant.

762
00:47:25,268 --> 00:47:28,144
What it does is, every time there's a bank transaction where interest is computed...

763
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:30,397
you know, thousands a day, the computer ends up...

764
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:33,024
with these fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds of f.

765
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:37,487
What this does is, it takes those little remainders and puts it into an account.

766
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:40,240
- This sounds familiar. - Yeah, they did it in Superman III.

767
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,243
- Right, uh-- - An underrated movie, actually.

768
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,705
And a bunch of hackers that did it in the '70s as well. One of them got busted.

769
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:49,291
- Well, so they check for this now. - No, here's the thing.

770
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:52,377
Initech's so backed up with all the software we're updating for the year 2000...

771
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:54,337
they'd never notice.

772
00:47:54,422 --> 00:47:56,464
You're right.

773
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:59,384
And even if they wanted to, they couldn't check all that code.

774
00:47:59,468 --> 00:48:01,970
Thumbs up their asses. Thumbs up their asses.

775
00:48:02,054 --> 00:48:05,849
So, Michael, whay's to stop you from doing this?

776
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:08,435
It's not worth the risk. I got a good job.

777
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:12,939
What if you didn't have a good job?

778
00:48:13,149 --> 00:48:15,025
Cock-gobblers!

779
00:48:18,112 --> 00:48:21,489
Samir and I are the best programmers they got at that place.

780
00:48:21,574 --> 00:48:24,492
And you, you haven't been showin' up, and you get to keep your job.

781
00:48:24,577 --> 00:48:27,495
- Actually, I'm being promoted. - What?

782
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,416
I know, Michael. It's completely unfair.

783
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,377
And I realized someyhing today.

784
00:48:34,462 --> 00:48:37,255
It's notjust about me and my dream of doing nothing.

785
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,092
It's about all of us together.

786
00:48:41,177 --> 00:48:43,470
I don't know what happened to me at that hypnoyherapist...

787
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:46,932
and, I don't know, maybe it was just shock and it's wearing of f now...

788
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:49,601
but when I saw that fat man keel over and die--

789
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:52,896
Michael, we don't have a lot of time on this earth.

790
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,649
We weren't meant to spend it this way.

791
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,902
Human beings were not meant to sit in little cubicles...

792
00:48:58,986 --> 00:49:02,364
staring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms...

793
00:49:02,448 --> 00:49:06,952
and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.

794
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:09,454
I told those fudge-packers I liked Michael Bolton's music.

795
00:49:09,538 --> 00:49:13,166
Oh. That is not right, Michael.

796
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,169
For five years now, you've worked your ass of f at Initech...

797
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:20,256
hoping for a promotion or some kind of prof it-sharing or something.

798
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:24,552
Five years of your mid-20s now gone.

799
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:28,390
And you're gonna go in tomorrow, they're gonna throw you out on the street.

800
00:49:28,474 --> 00:49:30,433
You know why?

801
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:34,896
So that Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point.

802
00:49:34,981 --> 00:49:36,648
Ugh.

803
00:49:36,732 --> 00:49:38,817
Michael, let's make that stock go down...

804
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:41,152
and let's take enough money out of that place...

805
00:49:41,237 --> 00:49:44,114
so that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again.

806
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,534
yoursoftware works, right?

807
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,036
of course it works. That's not the point.

808
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:52,914
Look, even if I wanted to, I wouldn't know how to install it.

809
00:49:52,999 --> 00:49:55,500
I don't know the credit union's software well enough. Okay?

810
00:49:55,584 --> 00:49:57,043
Yeah.

811
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,212
But Samir does.

812
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,215
- But, Peter, that's not much money. - That's the beauty of it.

813
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,719
Each withdrawal, that's a fraction of a cent. That's too small to notice.

814
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:10,015
But a dew thousand withdrawals a day, you space it out over a couple of years...

815
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:12,517
that's a few hundred thousand dollars.

816
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:15,687
- It'slike Superman I II. - Superman IIl-- What--

817
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:17,689
Look, I have to leave now, okay?

818
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:19,691
I have to get my aesumae ready.

819
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:23,778
Get your raesumae ready? For what? For another job where they can just fire you for no reason?

820
00:50:23,863 --> 00:50:25,530
That's right! If I'm lucky!

821
00:50:25,614 --> 00:50:30,744
I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed around. Aren't you?

822
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:33,580
Yes, Peter! But I'm not going to do anything illegal.

823
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:36,124
Illegal? Samir, this is America!

824
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:38,793
Come on. Sit down.

825
00:50:38,878 --> 00:50:41,379
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

826
00:50:41,464 --> 00:50:44,382
They're not gonna saw your hands of f here, all right?

827
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:47,385
The worst they would ever do is, they would put you, for a couple of months...

828
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,305
into a white-collar, minimum-security resort.

829
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:52,307
Shit, we should be so lucky!

830
00:50:52,391 --> 00:50:54,726
- Do you know they have conjugal visits there? - Really?

831
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,145
- Yes. - [ Michael ] Shit.

832
00:50:57,229 --> 00:50:59,898
I'm a free man, I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.

833
00:50:59,982 --> 00:51:04,319
- So, what do you think? - This thing is actually pretty fail-safe, Samir.

834
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:07,072
Samir...

835
00:51:07,156 --> 00:51:10,075
you came here looking for a land of opportunity...

836
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,286
and this is the knock of that opportunity.

837
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,705
Tomorrow's your last day at Initech.

838
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:19,417
You have two options: unemployment or early retirement.

839
00:51:19,502 --> 00:51:21,377
What's it gonna be?

840
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:23,880
- I have a question. - Yes?

841
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:27,634
In-- In these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?

842
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:30,345
Yep. You sure can.

843
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:35,141
Okay, I'll do it.

844
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:38,144
- That's what I'm talking about when I talk about Amer-- - Peter?

845
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:41,314
- How about we discuss the plan? - Okay, yeah. Good. Right.

846
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,316
It works like a computer virus.

847
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,319
All we have to do is load it into the credit union mainframe, and it'll do the rest.

848
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:49,322
Okay. You guys gey me that disk, and I'll take care of it from there.

849
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,158
But listen, before we go any further, all right...

850
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:54,702
we have to swear to God, Allah...

851
00:51:54,787 --> 00:51:56,788
that nobody knows about this but us.

852
00:51:56,872 --> 00:52:00,416
All right? No family members, no girlfriends, nobody.

853
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,460
- of course. - Agreed.

854
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:04,879
[ Lawrence ] Don't worry, man! I won't tell anyone either!

855
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:07,882
- What the fuck is that? - No, don't worry about him. He's cool. All right.

856
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,425
Here's how I see it all going down.

857
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:12,887
Peter, congratulations. This is one heck of a promotion.

858
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:16,224
- Thank you, Bob. - We'll get some people under you right away.

859
00:52:20,563 --> 00:52:22,647
[ Man ] *It makes me wanna creep *

860
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:32,740
*I got somethin' for your mind your body and yoursoul *

861
00:52:32,825 --> 00:52:34,868
*Yeah *

862
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:38,204
*Damn, I'm such a "G" It's pathetic *

863

*Here comes the big-headed nigga that's dippin' *

864
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:44,377

865

*Goddamn I must have to floss today *

866
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:50,884
*Now, pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary *

867
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:54,512
*So I'm chasin' bitches like Tom chased Jerry *

868
00:52:54,597 --> 00:52:57,056
*I put the pedal to the !flo-ah" *

869
00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:00,476
*In my two-toned Ford Explorer *

870
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:02,353
*You know how it's done *

871
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:05,523
*Sounds bumpin' Ain't that somethin' *

872
00:53:05,608 --> 00:53:07,442
*Jumped on the 1 1 0 *

873

*She's flyin' in the Blazer *

874
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:11,905
- [ Voice Slowed Down ] Hey, how's it goin'? - *Like "Go, Speed Racer" *

875
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:15,950
*But I ain't gon' chase her like Racer "X" *

876
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:20,622
*But I won't flex till it's time to have sex *

877
00:53:20,706 --> 00:53:22,832
*So when you wanna get together *

878
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:25,418
*'Cause you know a nigga like me *

879
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,795
*Is down for whatever *

880
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,797
- [ Cell Door Slams ] - *Damn *

881
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:36,221
[ Skipping ] *Ye-e-e-e-a-a-a-h *

882
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,227
*Ye-e-e-e-a-a-a-h **

883
00:53:42,311 --> 00:53:45,355
- Well, that was easy. - Yeah, I guess it was.

884
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:46,981
What'd you do with the c--

885
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:48,149
Hey, man.

886
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:50,610
Oh, hey, Drew.

887
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,613
- You guys hear about Tom Smykowski? - What, that he got laid of f?

888
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,907
No, man. Check it out.

889
00:53:55,991 --> 00:53:58,660
[ Drew ] Last week, right after he found out he was getting laid of f...

890
00:53:58,744 --> 00:54:01,829
he goes home and tries to kill himself by running the car in the garage.

891
00:54:01,914 --> 00:54:03,831
- [ Michael ] Is he dead? - [ Drew ] No, man. Check it out.

892
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,584
That wife of his comes home early from work and catches him.

893
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:09,587
- [ Coughs ] - So he tries to play it of f like nothing happened.

894
00:54:09,672 --> 00:54:12,590
I was-- [ Coughs ] having some trouble with the shifter here.

895
00:54:12,675 --> 00:54:16,135
It's jammed, and I couldn't get it into drive.

896
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,472
- I-I-I mean, reverse. - You okay, Tom?

897
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,849
- [ Drew ] Then, as he's looking at her... - Yeah.

898
00:54:21,934 --> 00:54:24,936
- he decides he wants to live. [ Snickers ] - Yeah, I think I'm okay.

899
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,648
- Right. - Seems to be working now. [ Chuckling ]

900
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,151
See ya later, honey!

901
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,654
Love ya!

902
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:38,157
[ Drew ] But then, as soon as he backs out of his driveway--

903
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:41,661
Bam! He gets slammed big-time by a drunk driver!

904
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,663
- Is he okay? - Sort of .

905
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:47,542
He broke both his wrists, legs, couple of ribs, his back.

906
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:50,086
But he's gonna get a huge settlement out of this, like, seven figures.

907
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,630
He's getting out of the hospital tomorrow.

908
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:56,134
He's gonna throw a party this weekend to celebrate. We're all invited.

909
00:54:56,218 --> 00:54:59,053
I'm thinkin' I might take that new chick from Logistics.

910
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:02,056
Things go well, I might be showin' her my "O" face.

911
00:55:02,141 --> 00:55:04,976
"Oh! Oh! Oh!" You know what I'm talkin' about.

912
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,978
"Oh!" [ Chuckles ]

913
00:55:07,062 --> 00:55:10,315
Yeah. Right. See you guys there.

914
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:15,069
Wow. Our last day at Initech.

915
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:19,407
I can't believe they had Security escort us out.

916
00:55:19,491 --> 00:55:21,993
Like we're going to steal something.

917
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:25,997

Hey, what were you guys celebrating last night?

I really can't

968
00:57:55,397 --> 00:57:58,232
All right, so when the subroutine compounds the interest...

969
00:57:58,317 --> 00:58:01,903
it uses all these extra decimal places that just get rounded of f.

970
00:58:01,987 --> 00:58:03,905
So we simplified the whole thing...

971
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:07,575
and we just-- we round 'em all down and drop the remainder...

1225
01:11:47,562 --> 01:11:50,480
No, we're not asking you about money laundering.

1226
01:11:50,565 --> 01:11:53,483
- We need you to hook us up with-- - Michael, he doesn't know anybody.

1227
01:11:53,568 --> 01:11:56,153
No, wait-- wait a minute. Look.

1228
01:11:56,237 --> 01:11:59,281
You just give us the name of one drug dealer. I could talk to him.

1229
01:11:59,365 --> 01:12:02,576
- I have good networking skill-- - [ Normal Voice ] I lied.

1230
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:06,246
All that stuff I said about being a crackhead just helps me sell magazines.

1231
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:09,875
I'm actually an unemployed software engineer.

1232
01:12:14,005 --> 01:12:16,715
- You're a software engineer? - Yep.

1233
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,343
Things, uh, must be very rough for you.

1234
01:12:19,427 --> 01:12:22,679
Actually, man, I make more money selling magazine subscriptions...

1235
01:12:22,764 --> 01:12:24,681
than I ever did at Initrode.

1236
01:12:24,766 --> 01:12:26,892
At Initrode?

1237
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:30,812
Wait a minute. You're not gonna tell anybody about this stuffwe told you.

1238
01:12:30,897 --> 01:12:33,607
I mean, we knoW a lot of the same people. That's--

1239
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:38,195
[ Clears Throat ] Actually, um, that all depends.

1240
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:40,614
Wh--

1241
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:46,536
What am I gonna do with 40 subscriptions to Vibe?

1242
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:50,374
We never should have done this. What were we thinking?

1243
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:53,251
You know what I can't figure out?

1244
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:57,255
How is it that all these stupid, Neanderthal mafia guys can be so good at crime...

1245
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,716
and smart guys like us can suck so badly at it?

1246
01:12:59,801 --> 01:13:01,718
We're new to it, though.

1247
01:13:01,803 --> 01:13:03,929
Ifwe had more experience--

1248
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:07,391
No, you know what I think? I think we're screwed.

1249
01:13:07,475 --> 01:13:11,019
There's enough evidence all over that building to link us to thiS.

1250
01:13:11,104 --> 01:13:14,856
Even ifwe could launder money, I wouldn't want to. What we've done is bad enough.

1251
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:18,235
We get caught laundering money, we're not going to white-collar resort prison.

1252
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:21,279
No, no, no, we're going to federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison.

1253
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:24,282
I-I-I don't want to go to any prison!

1254
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:26,284
Why the hell did I do this?

1255
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:28,912
I've never done anything wrong in my whole life.

1256
01:13:28,996 --> 01:13:32,040
We weren't thinking clearly because you told us we were losing ourjobs.

1257
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:34,459
And now we're worried about going in a prison.

1258
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:36,753
Don't worry about it. I'll think of something.

1259
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,716
- I'm going home. - Me too.

1260
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:47,514
You are a very bad person, Peter.

1262
01:14:09,829 --> 01:14:11,746
Yeah.

You wanna come over?

No, thanks, man. I don't want you fuckin' up my life too.

Goddamn.

And in light of the senselessness of these heinous crimes...

Peter Gibbons...

1274
01:14:47,575 --> 01:14:50,285
you've led a trite and meaningless life.

1275
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:55,290
And you're a very bad person.

1276

Hey.

1277
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,749
You're not working at Chotchkie's anymore, huh?

1278
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,960
No. No, I got fired.

1279
01:15:40,044 --> 01:15:41,962
What happened?

1280
01:15:42,046 --> 01:15:43,964
I flipped of f my boss...

Actually, a line cook, but he just happened to be standing there, so--

1283
01:15:50,263 --> 01:15:52,722
I might be going away for a while...

1284
01:15:52,807 --> 01:15:55,850
uh, to jail.

1285
01:15:55,935 --> 01:15:59,229
You were right about that computer scam. That was a bad idea.

1286
01:15:59,313 --> 01:16:01,815
I'm gonna take the blame for it, I decided.

1287
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:06,611
I'm on my way now to return the money and leave a confession...

1288
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:08,655
under Lumbergh's door.

1289
01:16:10,074 --> 01:16:11,992
Joanna, I want to apologize.

1290
01:16:12,076 --> 01:16:15,787
I had no right to get pissed of f at you about Lumbergh. Lumbergh is not my problem.

1291
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,789
Wasn't even the right Lumbergh.

1292
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:21,793
I don't know why I can't just go to work and be happy...

1293
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,421
like I'm supposed to, like everybody else.

1294
01:16:24,505 --> 01:16:26,548
Peter, most people don't like theirjobs.

1295
01:16:26,632 --> 01:16:30,594
But you go out there and you find something that makes you happy.

1296
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:32,679
Yeah, well...

1297
01:16:34,015 --> 01:16:36,266
I may never be happy at my job...

1298
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:39,269
but I think that if I could be with you...

1299
01:16:39,353 --> 01:16:41,313
that I could be happy with my life.

1300
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:43,356
I've been a real asshole.

1301
01:16:43,441 --> 01:16:46,443
But if you could give it another shot, I promise--

1302
01:16:46,527 --> 01:16:48,528
Okay, shut up.

1303
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:55,076
Whoa! Hey! What's going on here?

1304
01:16:55,161 --> 01:16:57,579
Get a room, you two! [ Cackles ]

I hate that guy.

1307

Then Mr. Lumbergh told me to talk to Payroll...

1308
01:17:57,098 --> 01:17:59,766
and then Payroll told me to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

1309
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:02,769
I still haven't received my paycheck, and he took my stapler.

1310
01:18:02,853 --> 01:18:04,771
He never brought it back.

Then they moved by desk to storage room "B" and there was garbage on it--

-Mr. Lumbergh should be here any minute. -I want to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.
