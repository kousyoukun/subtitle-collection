00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,760
which is why I work
at lnitech to begin with.

164
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,500
MICHAEL: Uh, yeah, well,
I work at lnitech...

165
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,600
and I don't consider myself
a pussy, OK?

166
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,980
SAMIR:
Yes. I am also not a pussy.

167
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,170
MICHAEL: They're gonna find out
the hard way I'm not a pussy...

168
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,910
if they don't start treating
their software people better.

169
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,510
SAMIR: That's right.

170
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,210
MICHAEL: They don't understand.

171
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,380
I could program a virus that'd
rip that place off big time.

172
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,010
PETER: Yeah.

173
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,220
MICHAEL: Big time.

174
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,260
STAN: Whoa!

175
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,450
There she is.

176
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,120
SAMIR: Peter, you know,
you always talk about this girl.

177
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,270
If you're so obsessed with her,
why don't you just ask her out?

178
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,460
Oh, I can't do that.

179
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm just another
asshole customer.

180
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,370
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

181
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,430
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

182
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,280
Oh, that reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

183
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,680
Why not?

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,740
I'm gonna see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

185
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,190
Dude,
an occupational hypnotherapist?

186
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,660
PETER:
I know. Anne wants me to go.

187
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,950
She thinks it might help.

188
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,730
Um...

189
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,200
You know,
sometimes I think that...

190
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,790
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

191
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,270
Yeah. I know what you mean.

192
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,790
Yeah.

193
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,200
What is that supposed to mean?

194
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,700
Nothing.

195
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,970
Why don't you just tell Anne
that you're not into hypnosis...

196
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,140
and you wanna play poker
with us?

197
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,770
I can't do that.
She'll get all pissed off...

198
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,220
and, besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

199
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,840
I mean,
he did help Anne lose weight.

200
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,120
Peter, she's anorexic.

201
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,990
Yeah, I know.

202
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,360
The guy's really good.

203
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,050
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

204
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,830
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

205
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,630
Hey, and speaking of problems...

206
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,190
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

207
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,530
with your T.P.S. reports?

208
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,940
SAMIR:
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

209
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,160
TOM: Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

210
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,790
SAMIR: ls that Smykowski?

211
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,860
-Samir!
-What's he doing?

212
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,600
MICHAEL: Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

213
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,470
TOM: I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

214
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,270
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

215
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,000
PETER: What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

216
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,600
TOM: So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

217
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,340
They're gonna downsize lnitech.

218
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,610
SAMIR: What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

219
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,880
TOM: How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

220
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,040
That's how I know.

221
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,850
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

222
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,750
It happened
at lnitrode last year.

223
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,590
You have to interview
with this consultant.

224
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,390
They call them
efficiency experts...

225
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,620
but what you're really doing...

226
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,060
is interviewing
for your own job.

227
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,460
MICHAEL: Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

228
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,730
and you're still here.

229
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,200
TOM: Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

230
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,400
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

231
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,530
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

232
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,940
SAMIR: Shit.

233
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,000
TOM: You know there are people
in this world...

234
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,510
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

235
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,710
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

236
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,980
You see,
that's what you have to do.

237
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,910
You have to use your mind...

238
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,080
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

239
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,490
and you can make millions--
never have to work again.

240
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,690
MICHAEL: You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

241
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,590
Sure it was.

242
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,760
The guy made a million dollars.

243
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,170
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

244
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,640
a long time ago.

245
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,340
PETER: Really? What was it, Tom?

246
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,940
Well, all right.

247
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,910
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

248
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,850
You see, it would be this mat...

249
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,110
that you would
put on the floor...

250
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,390
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

251
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,720
that you could jump to.

252
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,100
MICHAEL: That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

253
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,830
SAMIR: Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

254
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,930
Uh, look...

255
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,270
I gotta get outta here.

256
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,170
I'll see you guys later...

257
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,180
if I still have a job.

258
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,140
MICHAEL: Yeah.

259
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,010
Our high school
guidance counselor...

260
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,420
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

261
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,580
didn't have to work...

262
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,890
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

263
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,410
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

264
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,290
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

265
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,450
SAMIR: So what did you say?

266
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,360
I never had an answer.

267
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,100
I guess that's why
I'm working at lnitech.

268
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,660
No. You're working at lnitech...

269
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,760
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

270
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,470
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

271
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,870
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

272
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,340
SAMIR: You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

273
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,570
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

274
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,050
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

275
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,210
who works in securities--

276
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,450
MICHAEL: Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

277
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,150
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

278
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,660
what you would want to do if--

279
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,660
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

280
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,770
[Turns on television]

281
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,650
LAWRENCE: Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

282
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,910
Check out this chick!

283
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,420
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

284
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,480
Iike we can't hear
each other through the wall?

285
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,820
LAWRENCE: Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

286
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,020
No, but...

287
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,520
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

288
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,960
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

289

ANNOUNCER:
The key is early detection.

290
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,000
Tumors that are detected--

291
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,040
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

292
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,840
LAWRENCE: Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

293
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,420
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

294
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,040
Yeah.

295
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,350
A little bit. I...

296
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,220
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

297
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,690
You two still goin' out?

298
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,420
Yeah.

299
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,980
I guess. I--I don't know.

300
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,360
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

301
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,560
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

302
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,520
What do you mean by that?

303
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,090
I don't know, man.

304
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,240
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

305
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,610
she's the type of chick
that just...

306
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,800
Uhh.

307
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,910
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, l--I--

308
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,040
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

309
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,480
PETER: Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

310
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,250
Just--I had a rough day.

311
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,980
LAWRENCE: Tell me about it, man.

312
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,420
Ohh...

313
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,290
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

314
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,390
at six a.m.
every day this week...

drag up to Las Golindas.

316
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,430
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

317
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,200
Let me ask you something.

318
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,840
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

319
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,070
does anyone ever say to you...

320
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,600
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

321
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,410
No.

322
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,680
No, man.

323
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,380
Shit, no, man.

324
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,050
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

325
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,720
PETER: Huh.

326
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,220
LAWRENCE: We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

327
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,390
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

328
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,550
I just know it.

329
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,060
LAWRENCE: Well, you can
get out of that easily.

330
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,190
PETER: Yeah? How?

331
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,390
Well...

332
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,930
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

333
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,960
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

334
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,130
PETER: Yeah.

335
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,200
LAWRENCE: So all you gotta do is
avoid him--that's all right...

336
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,510
I got it--on the last few hours
on Friday...

337
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,410
duck out early...

338
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,070
turn off
your answering machine...

339
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,780
you should be home free, man.

340
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,910
That's a really good idea.

341
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,950
Fuckin' "A," man.

342
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,590
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

343
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,530
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

344
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,860
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

345
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,830
That's it?

346
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,100
If you had a million dollars...

347
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,200
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

348
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,040
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

349
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,910
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

350
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,710
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

351
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,180
Well, not all chicks.

352
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,020
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

353
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,210
Good point.

354
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,250
LAWRENCE: What about you, now?
What would you do?

355
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,690
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

356
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,950
Well, yeah.

357
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,550
Nothing.

358
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,680
Nothin', huh?

359
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,900
I would relax.

360
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,110
I would sit on my ass all day.

361
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,410
I would do nothing.

362
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,080
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

363
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,610
Take a look at my cousin.

364
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,650
He's broke, don't do shit.

365
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,520
NINA: Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

366
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,030
Just a moment.

367
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,530
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

368
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,470
Just a moment.

369
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,800
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

370
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,430
Just a moment.

371
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,140
BILL:
So, you should ask yourself...

372
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,770
with every decision you make...

373
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,970
"ls this good for the company?

374
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,740
"Am I helping with..."

375
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,310
PETER: ls that the guy?

376
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,540
TOM: Yeah. We're screwed.

377
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,140
BILL: OK, then, um...

378
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,700
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

379
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,110
a new member to our team here.

380
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,480
This is, uh...

381
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,080
Bob Slydell.

382
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,690
Yeah. Uh...

383
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,120
Bob is a consultant.

384
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,790
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

385
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,450
helping us out...

386
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,960
a little here...

387
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,460
asking some questions...

388
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,020
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

389
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,760
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

390
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,960
around here.

391
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,830
Yeah.

392
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,240
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

393
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,610
is Hawaiian shirt day.

394
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,250
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh....

395
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,880
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

396
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,820
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

397
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,080
Because I told Bill...

398
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,590
that if they move my desk
one more time...

399
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,460
then I'm--I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

400
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,990
and I told Dom, too...

401
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,300
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

402
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,530
and I used to be over
by the window...

403
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,830
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

404
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,100
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

405
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,610
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

406
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,610
because it didn't
bind up as much...

407
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,270
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

408
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,440
PETER: OK, Milton.

409
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,640
MILTON: No, it's not OK,
because if they make me--

410
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,120
If they take my stapler,
then I'll--I'll--I'll--

411
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,450
I'll set the building on fire.

412
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,720
PETER:
OK, well, that sounds great.

413
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,560
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

414
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,790
MILTON: Peter--

415
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,940
BILL: Good-bye.

416
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,800
Come on.

417
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,930
Oh, for cryin'--

418
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,250
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

419
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,960
Um...

420
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,970
I'm gonna need you...

421
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,900
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

422
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,100
so if you could be here
around...

423
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,630
nine, that would be great.

424
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,910
OK?

425
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,640
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

426
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,480
Um...

427
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,320
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

428
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,950
on Sunday, too, OK?

429
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,650
We, um...

430
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,520
Iost some people this week...

431
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,650
and, uh...

432
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,760
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

433
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,030
Thanks.

434
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,660
PETER: So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

435
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,700
and I realized, ever since
I started working, um...

436
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,500
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

437
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,210
the day before it.

438
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,880
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

439
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,720
that's on the worst day
of my life.

440
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,950
What about today?

441
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,290
Is today
the worst day of your life?

442
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,950
-Yeah.
-Wow. That's messed up.

443
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,390
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,690
Go on.

445
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,300
PETER: ls there any way
that you could sort of...

446
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,140
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

447
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,660
that I'm at work...in here?

448
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,180
Could I come home...

449
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,700
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

450
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,480
That's...really not what I do,
Peter.

451
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,850
Heh.

452
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,050
However...

453
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,580
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

454
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,720
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

455
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,590
I want you to try and relax.

456
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,160
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

457
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,470
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

458
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,410
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

459
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,410
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

460
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,780
as you slip deeper and deeper...

461
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,190
into a state
of complete relaxation.

462
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,420
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

463
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,020
Deeper and deeper.

464
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,030
Way down.

465
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,260
Your concern about your job...

466
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,300
melts away...

467
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,300
way...

468
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,810
way down.

469
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,210
Unh.

470
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,710
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

471
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,210
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

472
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,220
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

473
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,920
and you will remain
in that state...

474
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,460
until I snap my fingers.

475
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,980
Three.

476
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,790
Deeper and deeper.

477
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,520
Way...

478
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,050
way down.

479
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,070
Two.

480
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,160

to make sure you knew...

that we did start

Peter, what's gotten into you?

527
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,360
First, you just sit there
while Dr. Swanson dies...

528
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,270
then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

529
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,040
and don't blame this
on hypnosis, either.

use the old time sheets--

is you take the specifications
from the customers...

00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,960
and you bring them down
to the software engineers?

Well, then I just have to ask...

575
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,290
why couldn't the customers...

576
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,890
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

TOM: Well, I'll tell you why.

578
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,930
Uh, because...

at dealing with customers.

00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,710
you physically take the specs
from the customer?

Well...

583
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,450
no. My secretary does that
or the fax.

to the software people.

sometimes.

say you do here?

592
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,240
Well, look,
I already told you.

593
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,580
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

594
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,480
so the engineers don't have to.

595
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,570
I have people skills.

596
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,640
I am good at dealing
with people!

with you people?!

SLYDELL: Are you any relation
to the pop singer?

607
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,110
MICHAEL: No, it's--it's
just a coincidence.

608
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,740
SLYDELL: Ha ha.
To be honest with you...

609
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,450
I love his music. I do.

-I'm a Michael Bolton fan.
-Me, too.

SLYDELL: For my money, I don't
know if it gets any better...

612
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,890
than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

613
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,900
But you must really
love his music, huh?

00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,900
he's pretty--
he's pretty good, I guess.

617
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,600
You're goddamn right, he is.

your favorite song of his?

620
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,980
Mmm...

621

[Michael clears throat]

622
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,770
I don't--I don't know.
Heh heh.

623
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,180
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

624
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,380
SLYDELL: That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

625
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,720
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

626
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,220
being you have
the same name as him.

627
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,190
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalog.

628
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,750
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

629
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,990
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

630
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,560
Hi.

631
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,900
Hey.

632
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,740
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

633
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,910
I think it would be OK.

634
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,710
Would you like to sit down?

635
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,980
OK.

Ahh.

This place is really...nice.

639
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,190
Yeah. Is it?

640
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,460
JOANNA: Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

641
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,830
I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

642
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,830
I like yours.

643
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,030
JOANNA: Ugh!

644
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,900
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

645
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,030
JOANNA: Yeah.

646
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,510
Really. Ha ha.

647
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,940
It's on your...

648
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,510
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

649
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,520
That's, uh...

650
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,540
That's one of my--
my pieces of flair.

651
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,710
PETER:
What's a "piece of flair"?

652
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,780
JOANNA:
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

653
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,420
Iike these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

654
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,550
We're actually required
to wear...

655
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,590
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

656
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,860
It's really stupid, actually.

657
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,130
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

658
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,660
JOANNA: Yeah, yeah, we do.

659
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,900
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

660
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,270
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

661
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,970
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

662
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,340
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

663
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,820
OK.

664
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,880
JOANNA:
So, where do you, work, Peter?

665
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,440
PETER: lnitech.

666
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,290
JOANNA: And--Yeah?
What--what do you do there?

667
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,150
I sit in a cubicle...

668
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,160
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

669
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,760
What's that?

670
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,990
PETER: Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

671
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,000
and, uh, to save space...

672
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,830
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

673
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,840
So like 98 instead of 1998.

674
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,110
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

675
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,980
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

676
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,950
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

677
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,280
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

678
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,820
You're just not gonna go?

679
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,080
PETER: Yeah.

680
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,280
Won't you get fired?

681
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,450
I don't know.

682
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,290
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

683
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,560
So you're gonna quit?

684
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,800
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

685
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,430
I'm just gonna stop going.

686
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,800
PETER: What?

687
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,930
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

688
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,100
PETER: About an hour ago.

689
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,610
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

690
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,810
JOANNA: An hour ago.

691
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,740
So you're gonna get another job?

692
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,940
I don't think I'd like
another job.

693
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,890
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and--

694
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,480
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

695
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,990
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

696
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,220
Ahh...

697
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,390
well, so what do you want to do?

698
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,420
I want to take you
out to dinner...

699
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,830
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

700
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,170
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

701
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,070
I love "Kung Fu."

702
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,410
-Channel 39.
-Totally.

703
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,240
PETER: You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

704
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,270
-OK.
-Great.

705
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,510
OK. Can we order lunch first?

706
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,110
-Yeah.
-OK.

707
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,210
[Mumbles]

708
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,490
[Inaudible conversation]

709
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,760
BILL:
Took a stapler off my desk...

710
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,340
[Laughter]

711
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,070
BILL: Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

712
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,290
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

713
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,910
MILTON: Nothing.

714
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,920
BILL: I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

715
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,250
and move your desk
again, so...

716
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,090
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

717
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,030
against that wall as possible...

718
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,360
that would be great.

719
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,920
MILTON: No, because I was--

720
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,490
BILL: That way,
we'll have some room...

721
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,370
for some of these boxes
and things...

722
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,570
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

723
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,060
Oh. Oh, there it is.

724
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,840
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

725
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,900
[Milton moans]

726
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,240
Great.

727
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,720
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

728
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,520
that would be terrific, OK?

729
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,320
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

730
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,590
[Mumbles] OK.

731
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,030
I could set the building
on fire.

732
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,330
-Peter.
-Michael.

733
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,500
What the hell's going on, man?

734
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,400
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

735
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,530
No. I just came to get
my address book.

736
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,770
I'm not gonna stay.

737
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,140
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

738
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,940
MICHAEL: What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

739
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,970
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

740
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,720
PETER: Michael, I did nothing.

741
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,240
I did absolutely nothing...

742
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,260
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

743
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,950
MICHAEL: I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

744
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,590
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

745
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,820
PETER: The who?

746
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,200
MICHAEL: The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

747
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,430
PETER: Oh, yeah...right.

748
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,240
MICHAEL: Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

749
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,400
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

750
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,640
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

751
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,510
It's the best day of my life.

752
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,150
SLYDELL: Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

753
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,350
PORTER: Uh-huh.

754
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,650
SLYDELL: Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

755
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,350
You must be Peter Gibbons.

756
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,790
Uh-huh. Terrific.

757
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,260
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

758
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,760
PETER: Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

759
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,320
SLYDELL: Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

760
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,630
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

761
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,640
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

762
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,570
for how people spend their day
at work.

763
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,340
So if you would...

764
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,940
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

765
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,450
-Yeah.
-Great.

766
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,970
PETER: Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

767
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,490
Uh, I use the side door.

768
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,510
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

769
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,520
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

770
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,120
PORTER: Uh, "space out"?

771
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,290
PETER: Yeah.

772
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,200
I just stare at my desk.

773
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,720
But it looks like I'm working.

774
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,640
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

775
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,500
I'd say in a given week...

776
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,410
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

777
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,310
of real, actual work.

778
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,080
SLYDELL: Peter,
would you be a good sport...

779
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,110
and indulge us and just...

780
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,210
tell us a little more?

781
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,780
Oh, yeah.

782
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,520
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. reports.

783
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,720
Ahh...

784
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,200
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

785
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,260
It's that I just don't care.

786
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,490
PORTER: Don't...don't care?

787
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,100
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

788
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,760
Now, if I work my ass off...

789
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,710
and lnitech
ships a few extra units...

790
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,610
I don't see another dime.

791
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,240
So where's the motivation?

792
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,950
And here's something else,
Bob...

793
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,950
I have eight different bosses
right now.

794
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,110
-I beg your pardon?
-Eight bosses.

795
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,280
-Eight?
-Eight, Bob.

796
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,080
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

797
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,780
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

798
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,160
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

799
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,460
That and the fear
of losing my job.

800
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,360
But you know, Bob...

801
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,090
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

802
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,290
not to get fired.

803
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,960
SLYDELL: Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

804
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,300
PETER: OK.

805
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,300
SLYDELL: What if--
and believe me...

806
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,330
this is strictly hypothetical--

807
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,440
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

808
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,210
equity-sharing program?

809
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,550
Would that do anything for you?

810
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,850
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

811
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,910
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

812
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,220
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

813
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,890
SLYDELL: Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

814
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,520
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

815
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,390
I hope your firings
go really well.

816
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,630
-OK.
-Thanks a lot.

817
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,400
SLYDELL: Great. Wow.

818
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
BILL:
So, Peter, what's happening?

819
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,840
Listen, uh...

820
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,620
STAN: Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

821
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,560
JOANNA: Yeah.

822
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,820
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and l, uh...

823
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,450
STAN: We need to talk about
your flair.

824
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,200
JOANNA: Really?
l--I have fifteen pieces on.

825
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,760
I also...

826
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,000
STAN: Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

827
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,170
JOANNA: Oh. OK.

828
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,180
STAN: Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

829
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,110
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

830
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,370
Well, like Brian, for example...

831
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,850
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

832
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,250
And a terrific smile.

833
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,580
OK, so you want me to wear more?

834
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,350
Look, Joanna...

835
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,520
Yeah?

836
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,460
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

837
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,620
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

838
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,760
OK? that's what
the flair's about.

839
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,490
-It's about fun.
-Yeah.

840
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,690
OK, so more then, yeah?

841
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,700
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

842
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,200
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

843
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,110
but some people choose
to wear more...

844
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,010
and we encourage that, OK?

845
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,340
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

846
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,580
Y-yeah.

847
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,090
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

848
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,680
OK.

849
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,590
SLYDELL: Right, so there's
three more people...

850
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,660
we can easily lose.

851
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,930
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

852
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,960
He's useless.

853
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
Gone.

854
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,270
DOM: Sounds good to me.

855
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,710
SLYDELL: Here's a peculiar...

856
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,080
-Uh, Milton Waddams.
-Who's he?

857
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,140
PORTER: You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

858
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,310
DOM: Oh, yeah.

859
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,040
SLYDELL: We--we can't actually
find a record...

860
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,420
of him being
a current employee here.

861
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,320
PORTER: I looked into it
more deeply...

862
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,320
and I found that
apparently what happened...

863
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,120
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

864
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,350
and no one ever
told him about it...

865
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,890
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

866
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,300
he still gets a paycheck.

867
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,200
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

868
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,360
BILL: Great.

869
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,130
DOM:
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

870
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,300
SLYDELL: Just a second there,
professor.

871
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,930
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

872
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,140
So he won't be receiving
a paycheck anymore.

873
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,670
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

874
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,810
PORTER: We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

875
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,980
The problem is solved
from your end.

876
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,150
[Laughter]

877
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,680
SLYDELL: I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

878
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,320
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

879
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,990
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

880
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,790
with upper management
written all over him.

881
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,230
Eech. Ooh.

882
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,600
Yeah. Um...

883
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,930
I'm going to have to go ahead...

884
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,170
and sort of disagree
with you there.

885
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,800
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

886
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,640
and I'm just not sure
that he's the caliber person...

887
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,980
that we would want
for upper management.

888
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,710
He's also been having
some problems...

889
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,650
with his T.P.S. reports.

890
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,690
PORTER: I'll handle this.

891
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,820
We feel...

892
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,990
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

893
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,830
SLYDELL: Mm-mmm.

894
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,990
PORTER: It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

895
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,160
to get him really motivated.

896
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,360
SLYDELL: There it is.

897
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,330
Yeah...Ah, well...

898
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,670
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

899
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,440
SLYDELL: Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

900
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,780
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

901
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,780
dealing with
these T.P.S. reports?

902
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,180
Yeah...

903
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,170
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

904
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,480
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

905
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,150
A real gangsta ass nigger
plays his cards right

906
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,780
A real gangsta ass nigger
never runs his mouth

907
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,890
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers don't start fights

908
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,420
And niggers always
gotta hide here

909
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,300
Showin' all his boys
how we shot 'em

910

Real gangsta ass niggers
don't flex nuts

911
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,300
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers know they got 'em

912
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,370
And everything is cool
in the mind of a gangsta

913
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,880
'Cause gangsta ass niggers
think deep

GETO BOYS RAPPING:
Although I was born in Jamaica

926
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,720
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals

00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,970
Some got killed in the past

933
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,640
But this gangsta here
was a smart one

934
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,610
Started living for the Lord

941
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,860
what's happening?

942
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,240
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

943
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,210
and have those T.P.S. reports
for us this afternoon?

944
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,610

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,410
Ahh...yeah...

946
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,390
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

947
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,360
and have a little talk, hmm?

948
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,420

I'm--I'm kinda busy.

949
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,290
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,430
Just come back another time.

951
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,830
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

952
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,100
BILL: Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

953
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,330
PETER:
Yeah, they called me at home.

954
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,270
BILL: That sounds good, Peter.

955
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,510
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

956
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,880
get this all fixed up for you.

957
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,040
Great.

958
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,580
[Mumbles]

959
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,790
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

960
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:21,990
[Mumbles]

961
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,390
I--I didn't receive
my paycheck this week.

962
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:29,060
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

963
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,400
I did and they said--

964
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,300
BILL:
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

965
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,100
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

966
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,870
No, l--I...

967
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:41,900
BILL: New people are coming,
and we need the space.

968
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,280
MILTON: But there's no space--

969
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,910
BILL: So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

970
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,680
and move it down there...

971
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,750
that would be terrific.

972
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,150
OK?

973
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,250
MILTON: Uh, excuse me...

974
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:59,890
I believe you have my stapler,
please. Hmm.

975
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,200
PORTER: You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

976
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,400
PETER: I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

977
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,170
PORTER: Good one.

978
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,040
SLYDELL:
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

979
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:12,270
I'm sure you've--you've heard
some of the rumors...

980
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,070
circulating
around the hallways...

981
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,910
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning..."

982
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,250
with some software people.

983
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,480
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

984
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,550
PORTER: We'll be getting rid
of these people.

985
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:28,460
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

986
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,690
SLYDELL: Naga...

987
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,990
PORTER: Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

988
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,490
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

989
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,260
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

990
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,830
PORTER: Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

991
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,100
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

992
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,400
SLYDELL: It's standard
operating procedure.

993
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,670
PETER: Do they know this yet?

994
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,910
SLYDELL: No. No, of course not.

995
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,820
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

996
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,110
Studies have
statistically shown...

997
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,780
there's less chance
of an incident...

998
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,520
if you do it at the end
of the week.

999
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,720
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

1000
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,460
to have as many
as four people...

1001
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,830
working right underneath you.

1002
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,030
This is a big promotion, Pete.

1003
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,760
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

1004
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,630
and give me more money?

1005
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,340
SLYDELL: Uh-huh.

1006
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,640
Wow!

1007
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,670
MICHAEL: Hmm. Yeah.

1008
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,550
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

1009
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,910
Give it to me.

1010
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,440
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

1011
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,080
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

1012
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,680
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck--

1013
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,590
-Michael.
-Hey.

1014
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,990
PETER: Listen to me.

1015
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,090
What are you doing tonight?

1016
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,570
PETER: Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

1017
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,130
and maybe that time for you
is now...

1018
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,940
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

1019
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,070
Uh, no offense there, Peter...

1020
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,840
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

1021
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,150
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

1022
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,240
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

1023
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:05,020
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

1024
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,520
Yeah, and, uh, and l--Listen...

1025
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,360
That virus
you're always talking about...

1026
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,590
the one that could
rip off the company...

1027
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,100
for a bunch of money.

1028
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,430
Yeah, what about it?

1029
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,130
Well, how does it work?

1030
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,340
It's pretty brilliant.

1031
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,530
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

1032
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,070
where interest is computed--
there are thousands a day--

1033
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,100
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

1034
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,670
which it usually rounds off.

1035
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,110
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

1036
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,120
and puts it into an account.

1037
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,880
-This sounds familiar.
-They did it in "Superman Ill."

1038
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,120
PETER: Right, uh...

1039
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,890
MICHAEL:
An underrated movie, actually.

1040
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,330
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

1041
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,420
-So they check for this now.
-No, here's the thing.

1042
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,760
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

1043
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,960
they'd never notice.

1044
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,030
You're right.

1045
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,470
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

1046
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,480
MICHAEL: Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

1047
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,470
PETER: So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

1048
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,040
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

1049
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,750
What if you didn't have
a good job?

1050
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,420
MICHAEL: Cock gobblers!

1051
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:17,860
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

1052
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,130
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

1053
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,030
Actually, I'm being promoted.

1054
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,760
-What?!
-I know, Michael.

1055
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,330
It's completely unfair.

1056
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,900
And I realized something today.

1057
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,910
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

1058
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,910
It's about all of us together.

1059
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,980
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

1060
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,540
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

1061
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,320
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

1062
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,350
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

1063
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:51,360
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

1064
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,660
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

1065
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,670
staring at computer screens
all day...

1066
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,860
filling out useless forms...

1067
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,560
and listening
to eight different bosses...

1068
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,100
drone on
about mission statements.

1069
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,080
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

1070
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:08,810
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

1071
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,750
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

1072
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,880
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

1073
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,320
Five years...

1074
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,190
of your mid-twenties now gone.

1075
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,520
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

1076
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,220
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

1077
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,060
You know why?

1078
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,540
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

1079
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,230
Ugh.

1080
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,400
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

1081
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,430
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

1082
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,770
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

1083
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,180
Your software works, right?

1084
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,940
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

1085
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,510
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

1086
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,110
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

1087
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,860
Yeah. But Samir does.

1088
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,390
SAMIR:
But that's not much money.

1089
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,660
PETER: That's the beauty of it.

1090
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,790
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

1091
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:04,100
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

1092
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,600
you space it out
over a couple of years...

1093
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,930
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

1094
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,230
It's like "Superman Ill."

1095
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,330
SAMIR: "Superman Ill"?

1096
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,110
I have to leave now.
I have to get my rsum ready.

1097
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,380
PETER: For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

1098
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,150
SAMIR:
That's right. If I'm lucky.

1099
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:26,350
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

1100
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,190
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

1101
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,720
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

1102
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,790
Come on. Sit down.

1103
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,000
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

1104
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,000
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

1105
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,470
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

1106
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,910
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

1107
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,640
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

1108
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,340
-Really?
-Yes.

1109
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,750
MICHAEL: Shit!

1110
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,510
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

1111
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,350
So what do you think?

1112
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,910
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

1113
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,150
PETER: Samir?

1114
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,690
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

1115
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,890
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

1116
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,330
Tomorrow is your last day
at lnitech.

1117
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,930
You have two options--

1118
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,400
unemployment
or early retirement.

1119
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,000
What's it gonna be?

1120
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,440
-I have a question.
-Yes?

1121
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,240
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

1122
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,980
Yep, you sure can.

1123
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,750
OK, I'll do it.

1124
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:33,720
PETER: That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

1125
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,160
Can we discuss the plan?

1126
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:36,920
OK, yeah, good, right.

1127
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,450
It works like a computer virus.

1128
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,120
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

1129
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,390
It'll do the rest.

1130
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,800
PETER: Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

1131
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,740
Before we go any further,
all right?

1132
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,300
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

1133
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,870
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

1134
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,000
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

1135
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,280
-Of course.
-Agreed.

1136
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,550
LAWRENCE: Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

1137
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,810
-What the fuck is that?
-Don't worry. He's cool.

1138
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,290
PETER: All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

1139
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,220
SLYDELL: Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

1140
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,520
PETER: Thank you, Bob.

1141
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,820
PORTER: We'll get some people
under you right away.

1142
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,530
ICE CUBE RAPPING:
I got something for your mind

1143
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,230
Your body and your soul

1144
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,040
I got something for your mind

1145
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,600
Your body and your soul

1146
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,880
[Bang bang]

1147
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,840
ICE CUBE RAPPING: Here comes
the big-headed naked ass dippin'

1148
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,080
Sippin' on Crevassier

1149
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,150
Goddamn,
I must have the floss today

1150
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:44,790
Now, pimpin' ain't easy

1151
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,350
But it's necessary

1152
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,920
So I'm chasin' bitches
like Tom chases Jerry

1153
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:52,530
I put the pedal to the floor

1154
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,470
In my two-tone Ford Explorer

1155
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,800
You know how it's done

1156
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,400
Slammin', bumpin'

1157
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,040
Make that somethin' jump
on the one-ten

1158
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,550
She's flyin' in the Blazer

1159
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,710
Like no Speed Racer

1160
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,150
But I ain't gonna chase her

1161
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,590
Like Racer X

1162
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,450
But I won't flex

1163
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,220
Till it's time to have sex

1164
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,490
So when you want
to get together?

1165
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:23,360
'Cause you know a nigger like me
is down for whatever

1166
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,430
[Bang]

1167
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,850
MICHAEL: That was easy.

1168
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,940
Yeah, I guess it was.

1169
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,610
What'd you do with the--

1170
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,590
DREW: Hey, man.

1171
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,320
PETER: Oh, hey, Drew.

1172
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,020
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

1173
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,220
That he got laid off?

1174
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,780
No, man, check it out.

1175
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:53,420
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

1176
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,830
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

1177
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,030
PETER: ls he dead?

1178
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,660
DREW: No, man, check it out.

1179
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,870
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

1180
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,810
DREW: He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

1181
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,810
TOM: I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

1182
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,210
It's jammed.

1183
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,740
I--I couldn't get it
into drive.

1184
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,550
-I--I--I mean, reverse.
-You OK, Tom?

1185
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,920
DREW:
Then as he's lookin' at her...

1186
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,980
he decides he wants to live.

1187
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,550
TOM: Yeah, I think I'm OK.

1188
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,990
Right.

1189
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,220
Seems to be working now.

1190
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,760
See you later, honey.

1191
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,030
Love ya.

1192
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:34,570
DREW: But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway...Bam !

1193
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:37,270
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

1194
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,300
-Is he OK?
-Sort of.

1195
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,540
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

1196
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,780
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

1197
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,040
Like seven figures.

1198
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,610
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

1199
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,620
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

1200
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,680
We're all invited.

1201
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,450
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

1202
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,020
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

1203
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,460
Oh, oh, oh...

1204
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,590
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

1205
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,830
Yeah. Right.

1206
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,200
See you guys there.

1207
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,740
MICHAEL:
Wow, our last day at lnitech.

1208
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,070
SAMIR: I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

1209
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,340
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

1210
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,780
I stole something.

1211
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,880
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

1212
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,580
PETER:
No, I stole something else.

1213
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,090
What did you steal?

1214
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,960
Call it a going-away present.

1215
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,340
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Back up in
your ass with the resurrection

1216
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,810
Is the group
harder than an erection

1217
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,650
That shows no affection

1218
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,480
They want to ban us
on Capitol Hill

1219
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,950
'Cause it's die, motherfuckers

1220
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,850
Die, motherfuckers

1221
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,980
Nothing but the ghetto

1222
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,820
Taking drugs, step slow

1223
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,330
Kept my head low

1224
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,620
And never let go

1225
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,490
'Cause if I let go,
then I'd be spineless

1226
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,400
I'm going insane

1227
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,800
My mind, yes,
goes out of control

1228
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,630
On some subjects
motherfuckers read on

1229
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,370
I done the shit
that they believe in

1230
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:17,170
I see this motherfucker's
nine smokin'

1231
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,330
I seen this

1232
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,040
I bet you motherfuckers
will, too

1233
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,700
Because it's die, motherfucker

1234
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,270
Die, motherfucker

1235
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,180
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1236
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:28,190
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1237
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,660
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1238
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,160
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1239
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,180
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1240
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,960
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1241
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,330
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1242
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,960
I think it's something
in the water

1243
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,330
I think it's something
in the water

1244
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,300
So good to be free again

1245
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,970
With unity for men

1246
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,640
I walk around town
with a frown on my face

1247
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,940
The whole world
gonna catch a murder case

1248
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,280
The murder rate may decrease

1249
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,280
If you're caught up
in the world while it's dying

1250
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,680
I guarantee you'll fry,
'cause I am

1251
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,050
On the verge of knocking
motherfuckers out

1252
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,060
For no reason

1253
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,150
Once I get down,
there'll be no breathin'

1254
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,680
MICHAEL: Who's got my keys?

1255
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,130
SAMIR: I'm driving.

1256
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,890
PETER:
Everything is gonna be OK.

1257
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,830
All right? OK?

1258
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,490
It's fun, and it's exciting.

1259
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:19,090
I gotta--I gotta go. All right?

1260
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,360
Joanna's coming over.

1261
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,600
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

1262
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,840
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

1263
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,000
Everything will be OK.

1264
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,210
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

1265
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,980
All right? Good night!

1266
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,710
[Rapping] Back up in your ass
with the resurrection

1267
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,450
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

1268
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:43,260
Oh, um...l'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

1269
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,090
I really can't.

1270
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,900
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

1271
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,100
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

1272
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,070
that just get rounded off.

1273
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,700
So we simplified
the whole thing...

1274
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,040
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

1275
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,070
into an account that we opened.

1276
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,620
So you're stealing?

1277
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,550
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

1278
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:14,390
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

1279
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:17,490
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

1280
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,900
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

1281
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,700
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

1282
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,070
-Yeah.
-Right.

1283
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,230
It's not yours?

1284
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,500
Uh...well, it becomes ours.

1285
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,340
How is that not stealing?

1286
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,280
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

1287
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,440
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

1288
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,780
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

1289
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,120
From the crippled children?

1290
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,350
No, that's the jar.

1291
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:48,920
I'm talking about the tray--
the pennies for everybody.

1292
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,360
Oh, for everybody. OK.

1293
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,490
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

1294
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:56,430
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

1295
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,300
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

1296
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,430
and we do it
a couple of million times.

1297
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,000
So what's wrong with that?

1298
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,700
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

1299
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,940
PETER: It's not wrong.

1300
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,200
Initech is wrong.

1301
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,800
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

1302
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,940
Chotchkie's is wrong.

1303
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,950
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

1304
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,040
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

1305
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,520
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

1306
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,250
taking money from the register.

1307
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,520
Well, maybe you should.

1308
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:25,630
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

1309
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,930
What?

1310
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:30,330
Look, we don't...l'm--

1311
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,030
We don't have
to talk about this now.

1312
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,560
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

1313
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,330
TOM: Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

1314
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,530
-Hey, Tom.
-Hello, Tom.

1315
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,700
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

1316
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,500
Rob, Michael. Samir.

1317
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,030
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

1318
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,100
PETER: Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1319
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:57,050
-This is, uh, Joanna.
-Hi.

1320
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,480
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

[Coughing]
Ooh, ooh.

1323
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:11,490
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1324
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,530
Well...what do you think?
It's a prototype.

1325
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,370
PETER: Huh...that's...

1326
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,960
that's exactly as you
described it.

1327
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,570
Uh, listen, I heard about
your--your settlement.

1328
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,840
Congratulations.

1329
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,040
Well, thanks, Peter.

1330
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,020
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

1331
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,420
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

1332
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,150
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

1333
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,920
I used to be the same way.

1334
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,980
-Really?
-Sure.

1335
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,720
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

1336
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,630
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

1337
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:48,000
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

1338
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,400
Wow.

1339
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,030
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

1340
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,270
good things can happen
in this world.

1341
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,400
I mean, look at me.

1342
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,840
Thanks, Tom.

1343
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,780
TOM: Ah, sure.

1344
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,310
[Music playing]

ROB: Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

1346
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,150
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

1347
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:17,360
I have a client in there
right now.

1348
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,060
He says the trick is...

1349
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,000
kick someone's ass
the first day...

1350
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:22,520
or become someone's bitch.

1351
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:25,200
Then everything
will be all right.

1352
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,900
Why do you ask, anyway?

1353

MICHAEL: Oh, no, we just--

1354
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,470
SAMIR: It's a...

1355
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,810
-Hey, Peter.
-Drew.

1356
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:41,080
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

1357
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,920
-Yeah.
-Lucky bastard.

1358

DREW: Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

1359
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:49,190
PETER: Yep.

1360
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,860
Who's she here with?

1361
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,160
She's with me.

1362
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,130
-Really?
-Yep.

1363
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:59,600
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

1364
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,770
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

1365
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,240
Why's that, Drew?

1366
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,970
Are you kidding me?

1367
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,070
She gets around. All right?

1368
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,610
She does, does she?

1369
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,780
Oh, yeah, like a record.

1370
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,160
PETER: Like with who?

1371
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,160
Oh, let's see, uh...

1372
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,320
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1373
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,160
Uh, let me see, who else?

1374
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,460
Lumbergh?

1375
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,240
JOANNA: What if you get caught?

1376
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,540
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

1377
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,670
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

1378
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,080
What?

1379
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,310
What are you--

1380
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,510
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

1381
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,040
Aah!

1382
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:53,250
Oh...God...Lumbergh!

1383
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,280
Peter, what is wrong with you?

1384
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:57,060
That was, like, two years ago.

1385
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,530
What? Did you know him?

1386
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,190
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

1387
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,560
He's my boss.

1388
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,060
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

1389
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,200
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

1390
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,540
PETER: He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

1391
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,340
and you slept with him.

1392
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,810
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

1393
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:18,720
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

1394
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:19,980
I don't care.

1395
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,110
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

1396
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,380
Listen to you.

1397
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,910
Who do you think you are?

1398
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,520
How dare you judge me?

1399
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,390
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

1400
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:34,190
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

1401
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:36,930
wannabe criminal man.

1402
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,700
Yeah, well, that may be.

1403
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,230
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

1404
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,590
OK, that's...l'm done.

1405
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,880
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

1406
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,790
Call me when you grow up.

1407
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:50,020
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

1408
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,290
So don't call me, OK?

1409
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:53,530
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

1410
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,240
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1411
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:03,830
Lumbergh fucked her.

1412
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,110
Lumbergh fucked her.

1413
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,110
That is great.

1414
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:11,240
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

1415
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,080
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

1416
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,750
Ooh.

1417
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:19,450
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

1418
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,930
That's it. Great.

1419
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,120
Peter, what's happening?

1420
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,070
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. reports ASAP, OK?

1421
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,300
Oh!

1422
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,080
-Joanna.
-Yeah.

1423
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,530
We need to talk.

1424
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,460
Do you know what this is about?

1425
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:56,000
My, uh, flair?

1426
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,200
Yeah.

1427
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,070
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

1428
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:04,540
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

1429
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,910
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

1430
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:11,040
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

1431
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:15,350
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

1432
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,680
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

1433
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:22,090
Iike your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

1434
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,760
why don't you just
make the minimum...

1435
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,790
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

1436
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:28,460
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

1437
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,770
that you wanted
to express yourself.

1438
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:32,800
JOANNA: Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

1439
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,330
I do want to express myself.

1440
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,210
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

1441
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,410
All right? There's my flair. OK?

1442
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:46,780
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

1443
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,550
There it is.

1444
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,180
I hate this job.

1445
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,890
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

1446
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,800
Oh, shit.

1447
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,470
-Shit.
-Shit.

1448
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:14,070
-Shit.
-Son of a bitch.

1449
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,850
-Shit.
-This is a fuck.

1450
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,010
SAMIR: l--I...Shit.

1451
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:19,540
MICHAEL: What happened?

1452
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,780
PETER: You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

1453
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,410
SAMIR: Yes, it's your software.

1454
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,650
PETER: Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

1455
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,420
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred....

1456
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:31,730
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

1457
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:33,130
SAMIR: Oh, shit.

1458
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,190
MICHAEL: They probably
won't know it's gone...

1459
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,030
for another three or four days.

1460
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:40,670
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

1461
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,230
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

1462
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,570
MICHAEL:
Technically, it did work.

1463
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,940
No, it didn't!

1464
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,920
SAMIR:
It did not work, Michael, OK?

1465
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:50,540
MICHAEL: OK.

1466
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,780
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

1467
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,350
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

1468
01:06:56,390 --> 01:07:00,450
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

1469
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,050
MICHAEL:
Quit getting pissed at me.

1470
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,000
This was all your idea, asshole.

1471
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:07,260
All right. OK.

1472
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,830
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

1473
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,430
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

1474
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:16,200
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

1475
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,480
WORKERS SINGING:
Happy birthday to you

1476
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:25,510
Happy birthday to you

01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:31,220
Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

1478
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,350
Happy birthday to you

01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,070
BILL: Looks terrific.

1480
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,260
Mmm.

1481
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,000
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

1482
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,470
Mmm.

1483
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:50,940
Oh, that is terrific.

1484
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,310
Just terrific.

1485
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:56,110
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

1486
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:57,520
It's very special.

1487
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,850
NINA:
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

1488
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:03,190
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

1489
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,350
MILTON: But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told--

1490
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:07,920
Just pass.

1491
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:13,160
OK, here. But this...

1492
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:18,260
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

1493
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,300
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

1494
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,390
[Mumbles] I could set
the building on fire.

1495
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:46,560
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

1496
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,430
Hand them a check for the exact
amount they're missing?

1497
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:52,440
I--I think
they'd figure that out.

1498
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,700
Well, we have to do something.

1499
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,730
Maybe we could launder
the money.

1500
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,070
That's a great idea.

1501
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:01,210
OK, how do we do that?

1502
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,980
I don't know.

1503
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,750
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

1504
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:06,550
I think coke dealers do it.

1505
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:09,150
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

1506
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:11,520
My cousin's a cokehead.

1507
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,620
Fuck.

1508
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:19,960
We're in deep shit.

1509
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,730
Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

-Milton.
-Yes.

1511
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:31,940
BILL: What's happening?

1512
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,500
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

1513
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:35,670
MILTON: But...no.

1514
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,550
BILL: Since you're down here...

1515
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,820
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

1516
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,650
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

1517
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:46,750
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheck...

1518
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,630
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

1519
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,060
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

1520
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,290
and crawl down--

1521

DOM: Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

1522
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,700
We got a big problem--big.

1523
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:00,670
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

OK...but that's
the last straw.

help us, Michael.

PETER: I can't believe
what a bunch of nerds we are.

1535
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,910
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,350
I can't believe Joanna
slept with Lumbergh.

-Yeah. You didn't know that?
-Yeah, you didn't know that?

01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:51,720
MICHAEL: A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

1541
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:58,030
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the lnitrode guy? The young guy?

1542
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,590
Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

would have hooves.

Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

I come from a rough area.

Yeah. Um...

about any money laundering.

the name of one drug dealer.

magazine subscriptions...

1573
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,170
than I ever did at lnitrode.

1574
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,380
Heh. At lnitrode?

1575
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,440
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell anybody...

about all this stuff
we told you.

1577

I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

1578
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,620
Actually, um,
that all depends.

1579
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,560
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

1580

MICHAEL:
We never should have done this.

1581
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,870
What were we thinking?

1582
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:47,930
You know what I can't
figure out?

1583
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:51,210
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

1584
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,680
can be so good at crime...

1585
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:55,200
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,810
SAMIR: We're new to it, though.

1587
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:59,410
If we had more experience...

1588
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:02,890
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

1589
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,410
I think
there's enough evidence...

all over that building
to link us to this.

1591
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,690
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

1592
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,360
What we've done is bad enough.

1593
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,690
We get caught
laundering money...

1594
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:13,760
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

SAMIR: I don't want to go
to any prison.

1597
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,240
Why the hell did I do this?

1598
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,970
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

1599
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,270
We weren't thinking clearly...

1600
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:27,510
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

1601
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:29,950
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

1602
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:32,250
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

you've led a trite

-I flipped off my boss.

Actually, a line cook...

to be standing there, so...

about that computer scam.

That was a bad idea.

I'm gonna take the blame for it,

I'm on my way now
to return the money...

I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

Lumbergh is not my problem.

It wasn't even
the right Lumbergh.

Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

I may never be happy
at my job...

that I could be happy
with my life.

told me to talk to payroll...

to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,780
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a pia colada.

1729
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:11,190
And I said no salt, no salt...

1730
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,950
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

1731
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:15,620
Lo siento mucho, seor.
Pinche gringo.

1732
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:19,320
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

1733
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,230
I could shut
this whole resort down.

1734
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:22,860
Sir?

1735
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:27,340
I'll take my traveler's checks
to a competing resort.

1736
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,830
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

1737
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,140
I could have this place
condemned.

1738
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:39,010
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

1739
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,840
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1740
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,530
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1741
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:58,440
DREW: Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

1742
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:00,510
Aaaah!

1743
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,960
CANIBUS RAPPING:
Yeah

1744
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:06,390
Yo, 6:00 every morning,
you're waking up yawnin'

1745
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:08,490
To the sound
of your alarm clock alarmin'

1746
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:09,830
About an hour from now

1747
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,960
You should be
at your place of employment

1748
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,900
Which is annoyin'
'cause it's so borin'

1749
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,100
You coworkers are talking

1750
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,800
LAWRENCE: Don't come back
in a dress, man.

1751
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,070
Ha ha ha. You big fag.

1752
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:21,510
CANIBUS RAPPING: You wonder
why your workload is so enormous

1753
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:24,810
'Cause your boss just laid
off 3/4 of the whole office

1754
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,010
People get depressed,
they get ulcers

1755
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:29,740
From the stress that
the corporate environment causes

1756
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:32,510
Regardless of how
you ultimately wanna solve this

1757
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:35,080
Seems to me like you've
got one of four choices

1758
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,560
You can take a new job offer
for more chips

1759
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:40,250
Stick it out a little longer
or forfeit

1760
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:41,780
But my advice to anybody--

1761
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:43,090
JOANNA: I'm working
at Hooters now, you know...

1762
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:45,190
and it's very cool.

1763
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:47,860
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1764
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,840
I ain't working here no more

1765
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:53,070
Take this job and shove it

1766
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:56,170
I ain't working here no more

1767
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:58,340
Take this job and shove it

1768
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:01,280
CANIBUS RAPPING: Just shove it,
take this job and shove it

1769
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,050
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job, take this job

1770
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:06,050
take this job and shove it,
shove it

1771
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:08,280
CANIBUS RAPPING:
Yo, if your boss is a S.O.B.

1772
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,420
Tell him to s-h-o-v-e the j-o-b

1773
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,830
Put your middle finger
up slowly

1774
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:17,190
Put it close enough to his face
so he can examine it closely

1775
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:18,990
Say "l ain't working here
no more

1776
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,300
"Who do you think you are?"

1777
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:22,060
Whip the apron off,
throw it on the floor

1778
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:25,440
Run to the door, to the pay
phone, make a toll-free call

1779
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,570
Tell your stocks what happened
and where you are

1780
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:30,040
So they can come
and get you in the car later on

1781
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,710
And help you search
for a new nine-to-five job

1782
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:35,180
If the unemployment line
ain't that long

1783
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,950
You can take your time
filling out W-9 forms

1784
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:40,890
Eventually, you'll get on
if you try hard enough

1785
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,550
And you get money if you keep
punching your time card enough

1786
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:45,250
Maybe you hate it,
maybe you love it

1787
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,190
But if you hate it,
all you gotta do

1788
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:48,790
Is get mad
and tell your boss to

1789
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:50,730
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1790
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:54,100
I ain't working here no more

1791
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,040
Take this job and shove it

1792
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:59,300
I ain't working here no more

1793
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,640
Take this job and shove it

1794
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,540
I ain't working here no more

1795
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:09,350
Take this job, take this job,
take this job and shove it

1796
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:12,010
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, so mind
your patience or like slave gigs

1797
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:14,520
The boss' favorite to get
placed in something spacious

1798
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,110
While the most hated get placed

1799
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,780
In some small cubicle spaces

1800
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,450
Or get thrown down
in the basement

1801
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:22,220
Get your stapler confiscated,
you constantly waitin'

1802
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,490
For a paycheck,
twelve months pass by

1803
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:25,830
And you still ain't get paid yet

1804
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,360
Here's an optimistic motto

1805
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,060
If you ever late for today

1806
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,970
You can stay early for tomorrow

1807
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:32,700
Most nine-to-fives are hard

1808
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,170
'Cause the description
of the job

1809
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:35,940
Ain't no picnic in the park

1810
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:38,840
People get hired,
drink coffee to stay wired

1811
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,370
So they don't get tired,
sleep late, and get fired

1812
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,850
BIZ MARKIE RAPPING: You came in
late, you already ate

1813
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,480
Now, you want
to take a lunch break?

1814
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,250
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, bust it,
ain't no need to discuss it

1815
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:52,260
Just take this job and shove it
right between your buttocks

Ay-ya ya-ya-ya,

CANIBUS RAPPING: Just shove it

Canibus and the Biz

From, from Canibus
