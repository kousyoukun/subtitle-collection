1
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:40,595
Well boys, I hate to break up a good party...

2
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:43,315
...but you can't keep
a woman waiting, can you?

3
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,675
You know how it is, boys.
- Yes we do, Mr. Hogarth.

4
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:48,795
That's right, JJ.
- I'll say you can't, JJ.

5
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:52,295
I see you can all understand, all right.

6
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:57,195
Well believe you me, boys,
I've had the time of my life tonight.

7
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:00,355
And speaking of time, I have here...

8
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:03,492
...a 14-karat 17-jewel timepiece.

9
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:06,950
And that's only right, because...

10
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,555
...the man I'm giving it to
is a 14-karat 17-jewel cashier.

11
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:12,655
Hear hear.
- Hear hear.

12
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:14,355
Pass it along to him, boys.

13
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:18,365
That's a beautiful watch, JJ.
- It's wonderful.

14
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,775
Chris.

15
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,390
Read what's engraved inside, Chris.

16
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:35,940
To my friend Christopher Cross...

17
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:41,290
...in token of 25 years of faithful service,...

18
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:46,644
...from JJ Hogarth, 1909-1934.

19
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,755
Speech. Speech.

20
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,555
Speak up, Chris, speak up.
- Come on, Chris, speech.

21
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:55,655
Well I...

22
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:58,475
...I hardly know what to say, JJ.

23
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:01,612
This... why, it's beautiful.

24
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:06,555
I never expected to own a watch like this.

25
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,655
No sir, I...

26
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:11,315
Well... all I can say is that...

27
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:14,730
...we've got the best boss in New York.

28
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Good going, friend.

29
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:30,875
Congratulations, old boy,
congratulations.

30
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:32,975
Good boy, good boy.

31
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:36,835
Thank you, Chris.
Thank you, my old friend.

32
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,145
God bless you.
- Thank you.

33
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:42,795
Have a smoke before I go.
- Well, I... don't usually, JJ.

34
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:44,595
Go ahead and try it.

35
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:47,195
It's made special for me.
A dollar apiece.

36
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,684
Here, Charlie.
- Oh, thanks.

37
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,635
Thank you.

38
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,755
You're not supersticious,
are you, Chris?

39
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,855
No, no, no sir, no sir.

40
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:08,300
Now don't break up a good party,
just because I've got to go.

41
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,248
Everything is charged to JJ.

42
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:14,075
That's very nice of you, boss.

43
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,475
You can drink all you want...

44
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:20,420
...only don't come in late Monday
morning with a hangover.

45
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,955
Good night, boys.

46
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,055
Good night.

47
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,700
Aren't you a lucky dog. - I'll
treasure this for the rest of my life.

48
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
I'll bet you will.

49
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:40,020
Hey fellas, look.
Look, come here.

50
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,335
Hurry.

51
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:52,455
Get a load of that dame.

52
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,135
That's JJ's wife?

53
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,980
The boss is stepping out.

54
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,455
If I had his dough, I'd step out too.
- Must be a load of laundry tonight.

55
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,595
There's nothing like the smell of spring.

56
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:17,595
Which way do you go, Chris?

57
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,595
I guess I'll take the East Side subway.

58
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:23,095
It gets me to Brooklyn a little quicker.

59
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:27,835
Hey, you haven't got an umbrella.
No, I'll take you to your bus.

60
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:30,635
No, it's out of your way.
- I don't mind walking.

61
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,945
The fresh air, the spring.

62
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,615
I'm a little drunk.

63
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,835
Never mind, I'll catch the next one.

64
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:57,235
You go on over to the subway.

65
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:02,010
No, I don't mind waiting,
I feel kind of lonely tonight.

66
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,415
Say, Charlie...

67
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:10,155
You suppose JJ is running around
with that young lady?

68
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,255
It looks that way.

69
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:18,005
I wonder what it's like.
- What, Chris?

70
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,451
To be loved by a young girl like that.

71
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,315
You know, nobody ever looked at me
like that, not even when I was young.

72
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,915
Yes, when we're young we have
dreams that never pan out...

73
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,210
...but we go on dreaming.

74
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:33,915
When I was young,
I wanted to be an artist.

75
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:36,995
I dreamt I was going to be a
great painter someday.

76
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,095
So I'm a cashier.

77
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,675
Do you still paint?
- Yes, every Sunday.

78
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,755
That's one way to kill time.

79
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:46,035
You know, Sunday is the one day
of the week I don't like.

80
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:47,235
I never know what to do with myself.

81
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:53,625
Why don't you come over tomorrow and
see me? - Thanks, Chris, I'll do that.

82
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:56,635
Good night, Chris.
- Good night, Charlie. See you tomorrow.

83
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,735
Good night.

84
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,275
It stopped raining.
- Yeah, half an hour ago.

85
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,235
Which way is it to the East Side subway?

86
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:20,955
Around the corner, past the 'L',

87
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:23,435
four blocks.
- Thank you, Officer.

88
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,515
I guess I got turned around.

89
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:29,630
These streets are all mixed up
in Greenwich Village. - Yeah.

90
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:15,275
Is he hurt?

91
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,695
I'll go call a policeman.
- No, wait... wait.

92
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:31,015
Officer.

93
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,115
Officer.

94
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:50,215
Where did they go?
- In that direction.

95
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:51,855
What does he look like?
- I don't know.

96
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:54,055
I didn't see his face.
- He took 15 dollars.

97
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:56,415
He didn't believe it was all
I had, so he began pushing me around...

98
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:58,495
...and this gentleman ran in
and knocked him down.

99
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,135
That's right, Officer,
he was right there.

100
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:02,255
I couldn't hold him, he got up and ran.

101
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:04,355
Wait here.

102
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:07,015
Come on, let's get out of here.

103
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:08,495
But we have to wait for the officer.

104
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:10,615
I don't want to get my name
in the newspaper, do you?

105
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:11,855
The newspaper?
- Sure.

106
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,535
We'll have to go down to the
station house and make a complaint.

107
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:15,015
And every time they make an arrest,
they send a detective to your house...

108
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,005
...for weeks. Oh, it's a nuisance.

109
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:21,535
Won't you take me home?
- Why, yes...

110
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:26,575
Well, sure... that is...
if you think that...

111
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:29,285
Well, here's where I live.

112
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:36,135
I'm sorry I can't ask you to come up.

113
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:40,145
I share my apartment
with another girl, Millie.

114
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:43,625
Good night, and thanks for everything.

115
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:46,135
Don't you...

116
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:49,125
...don't you want a cup of coffee?

117
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,635
All right.

118
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:09,010
Hello, Kitty.
- Hello, Tiny.

119
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,360
Oh, this is Mr...
- Cross.

120
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:15,535
Glad to know you, Mr. Cross.
- How do you do.

121
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:17,795
You seen Johnny?

122
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:21,050
No, not since he left here.

123
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:23,895
Two coffees, please.
- I think I changed my mind.

124
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:25,695
I could stand a drink-a Rum Collins.

125
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:28,229
One Rum Collins?
- Yes, yes.

126
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,935
Oh come on, keep me company.

127
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:35,095
Well, you see I've already had
a good deal of champagne...

128
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,745
You want champagne?
- No, no...

129
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:40,635
Make mine the same.

130
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:46,135
You know, ever since I first saw you
I was wondering what your name was.

131
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:48,351
Kitty.
- It's really-

132
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:53,065
Katherine, Katherine March.

133
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:55,825
My friends call me Kitty.

134
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,855
What do your friends call you?

135
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,375
Chris.

136
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:03,475
Chris Cross.

137
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:06,295
Chris Cross.

138
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,695
Yes, the boys tease me about it, but

139
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,795
I don't mind.

140
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,845
Why are you looking at me?

141
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:26,075
Is my face dirty?

142
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,095
It's beautiful.

143
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,195
I'll bet it is.

144
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,875
Gee, I'm a sight.

145
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,555
Thank you, sir.

146
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:45,635
Cheers, Chris.

147
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:49,235
Miss March...

148
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:50,655
Kitty.

149
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:52,755
Yes, Miss-I mean...

150
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,775
Kitty...

151
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,514
Well, look... Kitty,...

152
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,775
...since I'm old enough to be your father...

153
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,875
You're not so old.

154
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:03,975
You don't think so?

155
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,795
You're not a boy, you're just...

156
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,355
...mature.

157
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:11,675
I like mature people.

158
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:14,920
Well, what I wanted to say was...

159
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:18,855
...you shouldn't be alone in the
street so late at night.

160
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,015
I was coming home from work.

161
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:23,115
You work this late?

162
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,275
What do you do?

163
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,355
Guess.

164
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:35,590
You're an actress.
- Oh, you are clever.

165
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:38,375
Now that you know all about me,
tell me about yourself.

166
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,475
What do you do?
- I?

167
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,075
Well, you see...
- Don't tell me.

168
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:47,555
You work in a bank?
- No.

169
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:51,095
Well let's see, Greenwich Village
is full of artists...

170
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,775
I meet you in Greenwich Village...

171
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,815
You must be an artist. Right?

172
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:57,915
Well, I...

173
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:01,175
Yes, yes, I paint.
- Of course, you're a painter.

174
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,695
I love paintings.

175
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,135
To think I took you for a cashier.

176
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,375
Well...

177
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:08,615
You know those art galleries
on Fifth Avenue?

178
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,855
The prices they charge.

179
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:13,535
I saw one little picture
that cost 50,000 dollars.

180
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,635
They called it a...

181
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,935
Seesan.
- Cezanne.

182
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:20,585
He was a great French painter.

183
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:23,095
I'd like to own that painting.

184
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,195
You would?

185
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:28,145
For 50,000 dollars?

186
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:31,900
Well, you can't put any price
on masterpieces like that.

187
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,855
They're worth... well...

188
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,815
Whatever you can afford to pay for them.

189
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:39,900
You know what, I bet I saw some of
your pictures there and didn't know it.

190
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,975
Next time I'll look for your name.

191
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,075
No, no, no...

192
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,440
I don't sell my pictures.

193
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,535
Not in New York, you mean?

194
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,495
No, I...
- I know.

195
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:54,055
I bet you sell your pictures in Europe,
France or some place like that.

196
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,415
You can tell I don't know
much about painting.

197
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:59,295
I bet you get as much for
your pictures in France...

198
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:02,175
...as those Frenchmen get right
here in New York.

199
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:04,575
You're never appreciated
in your own country.

200
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:07,655
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

201
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:11,455
But you know, when I paint
I don't think of money.

202
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:14,069
I just paint for fun.
- Fun?

203
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:17,775
Yes, I think it's the
most fun I know, painting.

204
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,135
I wish I had all the time to paint.

205
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,975
But don't you have time?
- No, I... well... yes...

206
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,191
You see, I...

207
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,075
Well, you know...

208
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:30,300
Business takes a lot of time.

209
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,935
No wonder, when you get all that money.

210
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:35,415
What play are you acting in?

211
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,895
It closed tonight.
- Which one?

212
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:40,885
The one I was in. What time is it?

213
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,794
It's only ten past two.
- Only?

214
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,520
It's time for Kitty to be in bed.

215
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,715
So you won't forget me.

216
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,355
Thank you.

217
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:04,335
Can I see you again?
- Sure, sometime.

218
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:06,615
Well, if you give me your telephone
number... - I haven't got a phone.

219
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,855
May I write you?

220
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,935
That's the address. Good night, Chris.

221
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,035
Kitty, who is Johnny?

222
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:15,135
Why do you ask that?

223
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:18,210
I just heard you ask the bartender.

224
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:21,335
Oh sure, he's just a fella I know,
he's Millie's boyfriend.

225
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:24,295
You know, the girl I live with?
Good night, Chris.

226
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:26,395
Good night, Kitty.

227
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,155
Christopher.

228
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,155
Christopher.

229
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,155
Yes, Adele.

230
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,275
This is a pleasure. I didn't expect to
see you, Charlie. - But you asked me.

231
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:36,675
My wife...

232
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,890
Well, it's good to see you anyway.

233
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:42,255
That was a swell party last night,
wasn't it, Charlie?

234
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,905
Say, what time did we go home?

235
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:47,165
After midnight, wasn't it?

236
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,375
You know, I haven't been to bed yet.

237
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:52,335
You haven't?

238
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:54,535
I guess I might as well act as drunk
as I thought I was, eh Charlie?

239
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:56,055
No, no...

240
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:58,855
Oh, I've got to do the dishes for Adele.

241
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:03,800
You don't mind, Charlie, do you?
- No, no, go right ahead.

242
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,155
Say, did you paint this?

243
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:15,895
Great Scott, no. That isn't painting,
that's mud.

244
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,970
Done by a photographer.
- Who is it?

245
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,435
The late departed...

246
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,855
Oh... your wife's former husband.

247
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:28,743
Detective Sargeant Higgins,
Homer Higgins.

248
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:31,900
Say, that's a real medal, isn't it?

249
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,868
Yeah, Adele got it.

250
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,915
Your wife?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:41,470
After he was drowned in the East River.

252
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,365
Jumped in to save a woman.

253
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:46,595
Neither body was found.

254
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,309
Oh... too bad.

255
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,515
Yeah, too bad.

256
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:03,495
Oh, thank you, Charlie.
- Not at all.

257
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:07,945
How long have you been married, Chris?

258
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:09,995
Five years...

259
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:12,335
Well...

260
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:16,095
She didn't want to spend his
insurance money, so she...

261
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:18,490
...rented out a spare room.

262
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:21,375
24 dollars a week.

263
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:24,335
Well, I was trying to save money to
buy paints,

264
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:26,435
so I moved in.

265
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:28,635
Oh, she was sweet...

266
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,725
Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.

267
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:34,195
And...

268
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:38,255
Well, you know how these things go.

269
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:40,135
Smoke?

270
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:42,235
Oh...

271
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:44,235
...guess I better not.

272
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:50,415
Where are your paintings, Chris?

273
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:52,335
They're out in the hall.

274
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:57,365
Would you like to see what
I did today? - Yes, I'd like to.

275
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:12,745
Where did you find a flower like that?

276
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:19,910
You mean you see this
when you look at... that?

277
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,069
Well, yes... that is, I sort of feel it.

278
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:28,255
You see, when I look at that
flower, I see someone...

279
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:31,755
Is there anything private in this house?

280
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,275
I'm sorry, Adele.

281
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:37,805
We better get out of here.

282
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:46,355
All right, Adele...

283
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:34,695
Can't you get those lazy legs
off that couch, maybe?

284
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,795
Come here.

285
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:40,655
Can't you do any better than that?

286
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:42,815
That's all you think about,
Lazy Legs, hmm?

287
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,975
What else is there to think about...

288
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,095
If you want more heat
in this apartment, Miss...

289
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:56,175
...you'll have to call a janitor.
- You idiot.

290
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,095
How come you're holding out on me, Baby?

291
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:00,775
Oh, stop talking about Saturday night.

292
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:06,145
I'm not talking about Saturday night...
I'm talking about this.

293
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:09,415
It sounds like a schoolboy
trying to make a date.

294
00:22:09,515 --> 00:22:11,855
You must be robbing the cradle.

295
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,695
What's so funny?
- You are.

296
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:15,655
He's old enough to be my father.

297
00:22:15,755 --> 00:22:20,295
That's the old fellow who came
to my rescue Saturday night... My hero.

298
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:22,135
No kidding.

299
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:25,255
See? You were too tight
to remember anything.

300
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:27,975
If I hadn't told the cop to go in the
wrong direction he'd have picked you up.

301
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:30,375
This the old fellow who butted in?

302
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,175
The painter?

303
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:35,935
He's rich and famous and
very sweet too, Johnny.

304
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:38,375
He doesn't pull any rough stuff like you.

305
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,695
Why, I had a chance
to clean up in a crap game.

306
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,655
All I needed was 50 bucks...

307
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:45,695
And what did you show up with?
15, for cat's sake.

308
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:47,295
That's all I had.

309
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:50,375
Besides, you kept me waiting
two hours in the rain.

310
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:53,775
And then you gave me a dirty look.
- I didn't give you a dirty look.

311
00:22:53,875 --> 00:23:00,505
Any girl who waits 2 hours in the rain
for a guy is gonna give him a dirty look

312
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:05,095
Trouble with you, baby, is
you have no imagination.

313
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:09,695
What do you expect me to do?
- I expect you to use your brains.

314
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:12,175
For cat's sake this chump
is crazy about you.

315
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:15,295
This is a set-up. He's in
the big money, isn't he?

316
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,135
You said 50,000 a picture, didn't you?

317
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:21,495
And here I am, knocking my brains out,
trying to raise a little capital...

318
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:23,695
...and this is right in your lap.

319
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:25,935
You don't have to call what's-his-name...

320
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:27,895
...and get a measly 50.

321
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:29,975
This bird is goofy about you.

322
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,075
Write him, date him up.

323
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:35,895
I can't take money off an old man like that.

324
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,975
For cat's sake, get big-hearted...

325
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:42,748
...and smart, Lazy Legs.

326
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:45,975
Why, I see fellas in the big dough
without half my brains...

327
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,815
...but ability isn't enough.

328
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:50,655
You gotta have money to make money.
Capital.

329
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:52,375
But the boys at the Acme Garage would...

330
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:54,815
...cut me in on a half-interest if I
can put up the money.

331
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:57,895
How much do they want?
- Three or four thousand.

332
00:23:57,995 --> 00:23:59,095
Yipe.

333
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:00,800
For cat's sake, I'm not talking
about chicken feed.

334
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,434
Use your imagination.

335
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:06,375
You get an interest in a business like that...

336
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:09,255
...and it's a cinch to squeeze out
your partners.

337
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,095
Then you're on easy street.

338
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:14,085
Jeepers, the pipe dreams you have.

339
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:15,655
Now what about the letter?

340
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,455
Oh, I can get 50 or a hundred perhaps,
but I can't get...

341
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:23,295
...the kind of money you're talking about,
I wouldn't know how.

342
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,095
Johnny.

343
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:27,895
Johnny, where are you going?
- Where I won't be wasting my time.

344
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:30,031
Johnny, Johnny...

345
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,875
I don't know why I'm so crazy about you.

346
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:39,975
Oh, yes you do...

347
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:43,125
Now what about my proposition?

348
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:46,115
You don't have to tap the old
chump for much...

349
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:47,435
...not at first.

350
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,035
We'll get you a decent apartment.

351
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:52,635
Someplace where I'll like to come and
see you, not a dump like this.

352
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:54,735
Well, Lazy Legs?

353
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,515
May I come in to my own apartment?
- Hello, Funny Face.

354
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:01,075
Why don't you just move in, Johnny?

355
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:02,915
Then I can move out.
- Now, Millie...

356
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:06,235
Stop picking on my fiancé.
- How do you spell that word?

357
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:08,835
With an 'F', like in 'Funny Face'.

358
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,595
She pays half the rent, doesn't she?

359
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:13,235
That was the general idea, Big Shot,
when we signed the lease.

360
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:16,115
I don't mind if you want
this place to yourself.

361
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,215
To you, Baby.

362
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:26,075
What's he mean by that?
- Oh, nothing. You know Johnny.

363
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:28,075
Yeah, I know Johnny all right.

364
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:30,315
Has he bought you
that engagement ring yet?

365
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:33,985
You seem to worry more about it than I do.

366
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:42,595
The new 45-dollar model.

367
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:45,675
Only Roger let me have it for 18.
He said he made a profit at that.

368
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:48,195
I thought you said you were
modeling girdles for the catalog?

369
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:50,295
I have been.

370
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,375
I ache like a dog.

371
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:58,120
If corsets ever come back,
I swear I'll quit modeling.

372
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:01,995
Why don't you go back to work?

373
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:05,195
With that figure, if you
weren't so darn lazy...

374
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:08,950
Who do you think you are,
my guardian angel?

375
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:12,835
Not me, honey. I lost those
wings a long time ago.

376
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:14,755
That's what I thought.

377
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:17,195
No wonder you got fired,
you're so darn snippy.

378
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:18,955
You never could get to work on time...

379
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:21,520
...after you met that Johnny.

380
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,355
Honey, what's happened to you?

381
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:26,715
Don't you wish it could happen to you.

382
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:28,915
I'm in love, crazy in love.

383
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:31,115
With a man who pushes you around
the way I wouldn't push a cat around.

384
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,235
You leave Johnny out of this.

385
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:34,075
With your looks and figure
you could get any man you want.

386
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,292
Sure, but there's only one I want.

387
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:39,075
Yeah, and he's making a tramp out of you.

388
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:41,355
You wouldn't know love if it
hit you in the face.

389
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:45,365
If that's where it hits you,
you ought to know.

390
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:34,385
That robin sings just like I feel.

391
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:40,585
Look, there's a pair of them up there,
they're building their nest.

392
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:46,315
Say, where'd you learn that?

393
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:49,615
When I was a kid.

394
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:52,755
But I haven't done that in 40 years.

395
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:55,450
I feel like a kid myself today.

396
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:00,155
Sold any pictures lately?

397
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:01,275
No.

398
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,475
Why don't you paint my picture?

399
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:05,315
I'd like to.

400
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,395
Could I bring my easel to your apartment?

401
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:09,715
I'm afraid my girlfriend wouldn't like that.

402
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:12,435
How long does it take you
to paint a picture?

403
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:15,235
Sometimes a day, sometimes a year.

404
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:17,595
You can't tell, it has to grow.

405
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,715
I never knew paint could grow.

406
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:21,275
Feeling grows.

407
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,555
You know,
that's the important thing... feeling.

408
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:26,955
Now you take me, nobody ever
taught me how to draw,

409
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:30,115
so I just put a line around what
I feel when I look at things.

410
00:28:30,215 --> 00:28:31,435
Yeah, I see.

411
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,535
It's like...

412
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:37,075
...it's like falling in love, I guess.

413
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:38,675
You know...

414
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:42,755
First you see someone, and
then it keeps growing...

415
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,955
...until you can't think of anyone else.

416
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,055
That's interesting.

417
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:49,755
The way I look at things,
that's all art is.

418
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:53,875
Every painting, if it's
any good, is a love affair.

419
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:57,275
I never heard anyone talk like that before.

420
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,995
Well...

421
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:02,555
...there aren't many people
you can talk to this way.

422
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:04,635
So you keep it to yourself.

423
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:07,195
You walk around
with everything bottled up.

424
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:09,295
Yeah, that's right.

425
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:12,180
That's the way it is with me too.

426
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:16,615
I'm sort of keeping things
bottled up too, Chris.

427
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:19,395
The truth is, I'm in a jam.

428
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:21,355
You, Kitty?
- You probably guessed it...

429
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:22,515
I'm broke.

430
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:27,205
Even this dress belongs to Millie,
I can't pay my rent.

431
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:30,235
How much is it?
- Oh, forget it.

432
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,545
I shouldn't have told you.

433
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:37,035
It'll spoil your day.
- Oh, but Kitty...

434
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:38,115
I'll get out of it somehow.

435
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:40,355
I couldn't take anything from you, Chris.

436
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:43,715
Well, no... yes... I mean...
- No, no, I couldn't.

437
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,595
I've never taken money from a man
and I'm not going to now.

438
00:29:46,695 --> 00:29:49,035
And I'm not going to spoil our friendship.

439
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,555
Oh, but Kitty...

440
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,695
I couldn't pay you back.

441
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:57,095
Chris.

442
00:29:57,215 --> 00:29:58,755
Maybe I could pay you back.

443
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:00,515
If you put up the money
for a studio apartment,

444
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:05,595
then I'd have a place to live, and you
could paint there. Don't you see?

445
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:08,075
You could paint my portrait.

446
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:13,975
What's the matter?

447
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:16,035
Don't you want to paint my picture?

448
00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:18,675
There's something I've got
to tell you, Kitty. - What?

449
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,775
I deceived you.

450
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:23,175
I lied.

451
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:27,260
I'm a married man, Kitty.

452
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,845
Why didn't you tell me, Chris?

453
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:37,515
You know I'm not the kind to run
around with a married man, don't you?

454
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:40,955
You know what you said
about meeting someone?

455
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:43,155
How you begin to like them, and...

456
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:46,715
...and you can't think about anybody else?

457
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:49,555
You should have told me
you had a wife, Chris.

458
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:52,395
Yes, but I'm not in love with her,
Kitty. - Well, you married her.

459
00:30:52,495 --> 00:30:56,235
I was lonely,
I couldn't stand my loneliness.

460
00:30:57,695 --> 00:30:59,695
Poor Chris.

461
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:01,675
Then you're not angry with me?

462
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:05,260
Why, I suppose I ought to be,
but I'm not.

463
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:08,095
Not with you, Chris.

464
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:09,715
I'm going to let you help me.

465
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:12,790
How much do you need?
- 500 dollars.

466
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:20,095
500...

467
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:05,970
I need 500 dollars.

468
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:08,635
I could pay it back 10 dollars a week.

469
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:10,675
That's all right, Mr. Cross.

470
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:12,635
But you'll have to have a co-signer.

471
00:32:12,735 --> 00:32:15,235
Thank you, no.
- Property owner.

472
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:18,225
Property owner?
- Just a formality.

473
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:24,725
Thank you very much.
- Anytime.

474
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,515
Well, write to that old skin-flint Hogarth...

475
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:29,395
...to give you a raise.

476
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:31,995
You don't even make enough
money to buy me a radio.

477
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:35,555
I have to run downstairs every
night to listen to the radio.

478
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:37,155
The way I have to scrimp and save...

479
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,075
...and you wasting money on paints.

480
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,355
I'd like to know what you'd do without me...

481
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:43,955
Poor dear Homer.

482
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:47,075
If only he had a grave where
I could put some flowers.

483
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,155
Why, you couldn't ask me to marry you.

484
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:53,555
I had to put the words into your mouth.
I'd have been better off a widow.

485
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:56,075
The only reason I put up with you
is because I'm married to you...

486
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:59,150
I'm stuck.
- Yes, and I'm stuck too.

487
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:01,935
Have you been drinking?

488
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:03,475
No, I haven't.

489
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:05,700
Let me smell your breath.

490
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:11,275
Then what's the matter with you?
Why are you shouting at me?

491
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,435
You keep blaming me for not
buying you a radio.

492
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,195
You think I like running downstairs
every night to listen to the radio?

493
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:19,675
Why don't you buy a radio? You have
money. - His insurance money?

494
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:21,435
Well, I don't want a radio,
you want it.

495
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:25,435
I'll never touch those bonds.
They're for my old age.

496
00:33:25,535 --> 00:33:27,515
If Homer were alive I'd have a radio.

497
00:33:27,615 --> 00:33:30,875
He made a good salary.
He gave me a good home.

498
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,800
Well, you're living in the
same apartment, aren't you?

499
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,960
Yes... but it didn't smell of paint.

500
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,595
I can't sleep for the smell of paint.

501
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:40,675
And all your silly pictures
cluttering up the hall...

502
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:42,035
If you don't get rid of that trash...

503
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:45,195
I swear I'll give it to the junkman.

504
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:48,455
Adele.
- I will.

505
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:50,855
I swear I will.

506
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:53,355
And the things you paint...

507
00:33:53,455 --> 00:33:56,275
It was bad enough when you used to
copy picture postcards.

508
00:33:56,375 --> 00:34:00,355
Well, Utrillo copies postcards,
and he's considered a great painter.

509
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:04,315
And now I suppose you're copying
Utrillo or whatever his name is?

510
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:07,475
And you're getting
crazier all the time... Oh, yes.

511
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:09,275
I saw what you're doing.

512
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,445
Girls... snakes...

513
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:14,195
Next thing you'll be painting
women without clothes.

514
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:16,155
I never saw a woman without any clothes.

515
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,255
I should hope not.

516
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:27,715
The Happy Household Hour's
just coming on, dear.

517
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:32,065
I'll be right down, Dora.
Mr. Cross came home late.

518
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:36,755
Go ahead and eat...

519
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,065
...and then do the dishes.

520
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:40,795
'This is The Happy Household Hour...

521
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:43,300
...brought to you at this time
by Happy Hour Bubble Suds.

522
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,900
No soap gives you more happiness,

523
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,811
more washings and more
suds per package,

524
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:53,700
than Happy Hour Bubble Suds.

525
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,835
Ask your nearest grocer for the large
economy-size package today.

526
00:34:56,935 --> 00:35:01,195
And now for the next episode of
'Hilda's Hope for Happiness'.

527
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:03,395
As you remember,
we left Hilda in the laundry...

528
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:04,835
...Bubble Suds...

529
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:07,130
...Hilda...

530
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,135
Christopher.

531
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,575
Christopher.

532
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:07,315
What are you doing?

533
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,835
I was...
I was looking for the paper.

534
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:11,935
Are you blind?

535
00:36:12,415 --> 00:36:15,675
No. Didn't you...
didn't you like the radio?

536
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:22,065
It went off right in the middle of
a program. I wouldn't have such a radio.

537
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:24,915
Say, did you read this?
- Read what?

538
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:27,015
This murder in Queens.

539
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:29,555
A man killed his wife
with a window weight...

540
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:31,755
...put her body in a trunk and
shipped it to California.

541
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:34,755
It says here...
- I read the paper, thank you.

542
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:36,555
He didn't get away with it, did he?

543
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:39,075
He'll go to the chair, as he should.

544
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:42,755
Yeah, a man hasn't got a chance
with these New York detectives.

545
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:46,850
Can't you put that paper down
and do the dishes?

546
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:04,775
Adele...

547
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:06,635
...you didn't mean what you said...

548
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,435
...about giving my paintings away
to the junkman?

549
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:10,535
You'll find out...

550
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,330
Well, you won't have to.

551
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:22,955
A friend of mine is taking an apartment...

552
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:25,395
...in Greenwich Village,
I'll move everything there.

553
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:28,595
Well, if he's fool enough to let you do it...

554
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:31,925
Go ahead. The sooner the better.
- Yes.

555
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:38,795
Top floor. You'll get plenty of light.
Lots of privacy.

556
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:41,835
You heard of Tony Rivera,
the illustrator?

557
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:44,355
He had this apartment
on a three-year lease.

558
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:46,835
Couldn't work anywhere else.

559
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,245
This was his studio.

560
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:52,795
The sketches on the wall are Rivera's.

561
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,595
He'd do that with his models sometimes...

562
00:37:54,695 --> 00:37:57,275
...when he was working
on a magazine cover.

563
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,995
Some people would pay
a lot of money for those.

564
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:02,645
Are you an artist, Miss March?

565
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,335
Where's the bedroom?
- This way.

566
00:38:09,775 --> 00:38:11,755
What's the rent, Mr. Jones?

567
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:15,355
150. There are some things that Rivera
left here stored in the basement.

568
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:18,475
They go with the apartment if you care
to use them.

569
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:20,955
Here you are... the bedroom.

570
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:27,190
I don't like the wallpaper.

571
00:38:27,215 --> 00:38:29,115
Will they change the paper?

572
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:31,515
I guess so, on a year's lease.

573
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:33,655
I'll pick it out myself.

574
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,190
Well, don't break the bank.

575
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:29,155
Hello, Lazy Legs.

576
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:31,890
I thought I heard the doorbell.

577
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:35,015
I didn't hear anything.

578
00:39:39,815 --> 00:39:41,635
Say, is this all you've got?

579
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:46,355
I'm lucky I have that left, the way you
were throwing it around last night.

580
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:48,275
You even bought me a book, Honey.

581
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:51,155
You're supposed to be an actress,
aren't you?

582
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,720
Shakespeare, for Pete's sake.

583
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:02,755
Say, that's all I have left.

584
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:06,675
You know where to get more,
don't you, Lazy Legs?

585
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:10,715
Told me he hadn't sold any pictures
for a long time...

586
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:13,620
And now I'm in hock for all this.

587
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:30,015
Look, Kitty...

588
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,520
I need at least 1000 dollars.

589
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,875
Ouch.
- Well, you've got him softened up...

590
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:39,835
Now, push him around a bit.

591
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:42,955
He seems to get scared
when I talk about money.

592
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:45,155
Listen Baby, you've got him
right where you want him.

593
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:47,595
He's on the hook and can't get off.

594
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,795
He can walk out, can't he?
- He's got a wife, hasn't he?

595
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:53,275
Just drop a hint that his wife might
find out about this apartment...

596
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,035
...and he'll shell out fast.

597
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:56,555
That's blackmail...

598
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:59,772
It's only blackmail, Baby...

599
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:03,340
...when you're dumb enough to get caught.

600
00:41:05,575 --> 00:41:08,275
Is that him?
- Told you I heard the doorbell.

601
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:11,265
For cat's sake.... Get rid of him.

602
00:41:42,615 --> 00:41:44,615
Why...

603
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:46,355
Don't you answer doorbells?

604
00:41:46,455 --> 00:41:48,915
I thought you were mad at me.
- Peace offering...

605
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:51,015
Scotch.
- Thanks, Honey.

606
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:53,875
I didn't think you were out,
it's only 10 past 12.

607
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:57,275
I rang and rang downstairs
and then I found the door was open.

608
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,375
Well, well, well.

609
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:03,435
You're doing all right for a working girl.

610
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:05,830
Now don't start that again.

611
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:13,115
Don't tell me he's under the sofa, too.

612
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:15,215
No, Bright Eyes.

613
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:18,540
You can come out, Johnny.

614
00:42:18,775 --> 00:42:22,090
All you have to do is call, Funny Face.

615
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:26,435
You must have made a killing in
Wall Street, Mr. Prince...

616
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:28,535
Could be.

617
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:31,115
The last time I saw Johnny he was
talking about going to Hollywood.

618
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,835
I might try it yet.

619
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:36,515
I read in a movie magazine about a fella
who landed in Hollywood stone broke...

620
00:42:36,615 --> 00:42:39,115
...and cleaned up a million.
No experience, either.

621
00:42:39,215 --> 00:42:42,715
All he had was looks, and he
worked in a drugstore.

622
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,995
If he worked, Johnny,
he didn't look like you.

623
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,675
Will you two stop fighting?
- I'm not fighting, Baby.

624
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:49,515
She just doesn't know my speed.

625
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:50,915
Why, I hear of movie actors...

626
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:52,835
...getting 5000... 10,000 a week.

627
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:54,235
For what?

628
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,795
For acting tough, for pushing
girls in the face.

629
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,190
What do they do I can't do?

630
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,155
You're so clever, why don't you do it?

631
00:43:01,255 --> 00:43:03,720
I might, Funny Face, I might.

632
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:12,835
Chris.

633
00:43:12,935 --> 00:43:15,435
I brought over some of my things, Kitty.

634
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:18,115
I'll bring some more tomorrow...

635
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:20,215
The rest on Saturday.

636
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,155
Oh... You have company.
- It's just Millie and Johnny.

637
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:27,555
John...?
- You know, Millie's boyfriend.

638
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:28,995
Come on... I want you to meet them.

639
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:32,475
Millie, this is a friend of mine,
Mr. Cross, Miss Ray.

640
00:43:32,575 --> 00:43:35,115
How do you do, Miss Ray?
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Cross.

641
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:39,550
And... Johnny Prince.
- Glad to know you, Mr. Cross.

642
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,375
How do you do?

643
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:45,075
Seems to me I've seen you
before somewhere...

644
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:47,895
Could be... could be, Mr. Cross.

645
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:49,715
Yes, I...

646
00:43:49,815 --> 00:43:53,435
I just don't seem to remember...
Maybe I'm mistaken.

647
00:43:53,535 --> 00:43:54,915
Could be.

648
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:59,435
Well, I have to run along, kid.
- I'll go with you, sweetheart.

649
00:43:59,535 --> 00:44:01,035
Oh, don't bother, Johnny.

650
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:03,875
I wouldn't think of letting
you go alone... Darling.

651
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:07,205
You might get run over by a streetcar.

652
00:44:10,175 --> 00:44:13,235
Goodbye, Mr. Cross. Nice to see you.

653
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:16,795
Thanks for the scotch, Millie.
- That's okay... Bye.

654
00:44:16,895 --> 00:44:19,700
So long, Kitty.
- So long, Johnny.

655
00:44:23,575 --> 00:44:26,040
Now what's the matter, Chris?

656
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:29,115
I don't think I like that young man
she's in love with.

657
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:30,795
Oh, Johnny's all right...

658
00:44:30,895 --> 00:44:33,995
Oh, I know he is, or he wouldn't
be a friend, but...

659
00:44:34,095 --> 00:44:39,110
There's something about him that...
- She's crazy about him.

660
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:42,875
Would you... Would you like
to see my pictures?

661
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:45,525
Not yet. Come sit down, Chris.

662
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:50,595
You happy?

663
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:54,350
For the first time in my life.
- Very happy?

664
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:56,835
I think of you all the time.

665
00:44:56,935 --> 00:45:00,325
All I want is to see you, be near you.

666
00:45:02,695 --> 00:45:04,715
I know I haven't any right
to ask you this, but...

667
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:06,931
Have you ever...?

668
00:45:09,335 --> 00:45:13,075
Well... there must have been
other men who...

669
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,135
Just one, Chris.

670
00:45:17,735 --> 00:45:19,735
You still see him?

671
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,375
I've forgotten him.

672
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:28,105
Look, Kitty... if I were single...

673
00:45:28,215 --> 00:45:31,035
...if I had no wife...
- But you have a wife.

674
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:33,430
Yes I know, but if she'd...

675
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:39,630
Well... if something would happen
that would make me free...

676
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:41,275
Would you marry me?

677
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,275
Oh, let's not talk about it now, dear.

678
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:45,075
What I'm worried about is getting a job.

679
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,395
Living like this... it's expensive.

680
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,915
I don't like to ask you for anything more...

681
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:54,195
...because... well, you say you haven't
sold any pictures lately.

682
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:55,955
Yes, but... don't you have enough money?

683
00:45:56,055 --> 00:45:58,395
You have no idea what a problem
money is for an actress, Chris.

684
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:01,355
Talent doesn't count in the theatre.
Everything is pull.

685
00:46:01,455 --> 00:46:02,835
Contacts, knowing the right people...

686
00:46:02,935 --> 00:46:05,035
You have to get an agent...
they charge plenty...

687
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:09,715
Wear smart clothes, be attractive.
- But Kitty, you're beautiful.

688
00:46:09,815 --> 00:46:13,410
Chris, your face doesn't mean a thing.

689
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:17,355
It's clothes, perfumes,
making the right impression.

690
00:46:17,455 --> 00:46:20,435
Why, an actress needs 1000 dollars
just to get a decent wardrobe.

691
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:22,924
1000 dollars?
- At least.

692
00:46:23,015 --> 00:46:27,915
Maybe I can borrow it from Millie.
Or her boyfriend... Johnny.

693
00:46:28,015 --> 00:46:30,140
He's got plenty of money.

694
00:46:30,335 --> 00:46:33,735
Oh... No, no, no, Kitty.
Not from Johnny.

695
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,495
Why not?

696
00:46:36,935 --> 00:46:39,825
I'll get you the money some way...

697
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,650
Chris, you're a darling.

698
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:45,635
I really believe you're in love with me.

699
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:47,735
I am, Kitty, I am.

700
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:53,413
Chris, you're a caveman.

701
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,755
I like you to like me...
well... there's a limit.

702
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,855
Yes, I know...

703
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:03,795
I've got to go,
I'm supposed to be back...

704
00:47:03,895 --> 00:47:05,915
I'll come here tomorrow at noon, Kitty.

705
00:47:06,015 --> 00:47:10,350
I'll be waiting for you.
I'm sorry you have to go...

706
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:15,415
Bye-bye, Dear.

707
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:21,520
Don't forget the money.
- I'll get it.

708
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:27,260
Bye-bye, Chris.
- Goodbye.

709
00:48:15,255 --> 00:48:17,255
I don't get it.

710
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:19,155
The poor sap must be a hophead, seeing...

711
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:21,255
...snakes on the 'L'.

712
00:48:22,735 --> 00:48:25,715
Imagine anyone paying
money for this stuff?

713
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:29,091
Say, are you sure he's not a phony?

714
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:32,235
He's too dumb to be a phony.

715
00:48:32,295 --> 00:48:35,675
You're right there.
- Then how did he get all the money?

716
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:39,715
Why, if he had to work for a living,
he couldn't make 50 dollars a week.

717
00:48:39,815 --> 00:48:41,965
You just don't know art.

718
00:48:42,095 --> 00:48:45,075
Maybe not, but I'm gonna find out about it.

719
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:47,175
I kinda like this one.

720
00:48:47,535 --> 00:48:50,755
But where would you find flowers like that?

721
00:48:50,855 --> 00:48:53,035
I wonder if I couldn't sell these.

722
00:48:53,135 --> 00:48:55,555
And what do I do when
he asks where they are?

723
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:57,195
Say you put them in storage.

724
00:48:57,295 --> 00:48:58,595
You know, you got to protect him...

725
00:48:58,695 --> 00:49:00,395
You can't leave valuable
paintings lying around...

726
00:49:00,495 --> 00:49:02,035
...where somebody can pick them up.

727
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:06,640
You'd get in trouble.
Any gallery would know his work.

728
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:10,635
He tried to kiss me today...
and don't think I liked it.

729
00:49:10,735 --> 00:49:12,995
Oh, you've been kissed before.

730
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:15,730
Say... they're not even signed.

731
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:18,235
That doesn't matter, they'd know them.

732
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,955
Not where I take them, Baby.

733
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:24,730
Johnny... I can't stand to
have anyone touch me but you.

734
00:49:25,055 --> 00:49:27,475
I hate him when he looks at me like that.

735
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:31,955
If he were mean or vicious or
if he bawled me out I'd like him better.

736
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,755
You don't love me,

737
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:36,035
or you'd understand what I mean.

738
00:49:36,135 --> 00:49:38,135
No?
- No.

739
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:51,195
No?

740
00:49:51,295 --> 00:49:53,490
Well... maybe.

741
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:01,915
Working late tonight, Mr. Cross?

742
00:50:02,015 --> 00:50:04,595
I'm about through, Ben,
you can let me out in a minute.

743
00:50:04,695 --> 00:50:06,695
Yes, sir.

744
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:39,385
I just caught you in time.

745
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:53,675
Cash this for me, will you, Chris?
It's personal.

746
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:56,608
Yes, yes... Yes, of course, JJ.

747
00:51:19,255 --> 00:51:20,995
Here you are, JJ.
- Thank you, Chris.

748
00:51:21,095 --> 00:51:23,305
Good night.
Good night, JJ.

749
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:35,455
Hello, Nick.
- Hi.

750
00:51:46,175 --> 00:51:48,175
What do you got?

751
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:54,445
The fellow who paints those gets
50 grand for a single picture.

752
00:51:55,815 --> 00:51:58,235
Hey. What's the matter with you, Nick?

753
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,875
Where'd you pick them up...
over in Washington Square?

754
00:52:00,975 --> 00:52:02,995
The Village long-hairs are
peddling junk like that...

755
00:52:03,095 --> 00:52:04,555
...for the price of the canvas.

756
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,675
These weren't painted by
any Village long-hair.

757
00:52:07,775 --> 00:52:10,035
That's my pawnshop, isn't it?

758
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:13,155
And that snake is strictly from the Bronx.

759
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,395
This fellow lives in Brooklyn.
He's famous.

760
00:52:15,495 --> 00:52:17,595
Yeah, what's his name?
- Well, I...

761
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:21,155
Nick, I've brought you stuff before
and you never asked for any name on it.

762
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:25,835
That was jewelry. Bring me some more
of that and we can do business, Johnny.

763
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:30,780
Take this junk back to Washington Square
where you got it.

764
00:53:08,975 --> 00:53:12,035
I can see you've got an eye for art.

765
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:14,375
That's one of my best.

766
00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:16,575
Take a look at these...

767
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:19,075
I didn't know you were a painter.

768
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:21,175
I'm not.

769
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:27,190
Are they any good?
- Well...

770
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:29,660
...they've got something.

771
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:32,455
A certain peculiar...

772
00:53:33,135 --> 00:53:35,940
...something. But no perspective.

773
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:38,395
Is that important?
- I should say it is.

774
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,495
Look at my paintings.

775
00:53:40,775 --> 00:53:42,115
Where did you buy them?

776
00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:43,915
I didn't buy them,
I want to sell them.

777
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:45,715
You want me to sell them on commission?

778
00:53:45,815 --> 00:53:49,315
How much do you think they're worth?
- I always start everything at 25.

779
00:53:49,415 --> 00:53:52,875
Then... you know, it's a hard
business selling pictures.

780
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:55,525
People don't buy art nowadays.

781
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:58,675
No appreciation, no taste,
no perception...

782
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:00,775
No perspective, huh?

783
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:06,515
Let me have your name and address.

784
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:09,335
I'll come back later... So long.

785
00:54:15,855 --> 00:54:18,150
Hello, Johnny.
- Hiya, Tiny.

786
00:54:20,535 --> 00:54:22,535
Where'd you get that?

787
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:24,955
Off Nick.

788
00:54:25,055 --> 00:54:27,055
What about my ring?

789
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:31,195
You know how much a good diamond
costs? - I gave you 900 dollars.

790
00:54:31,295 --> 00:54:33,295
Will you pipe down?

791
00:54:40,615 --> 00:54:43,675
You've been telling me what a dope
the old guy is...

792
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:45,775
Maybe you're the dope.

793
00:54:47,055 --> 00:54:49,795
He told you his paintings
are worth a lot of money...

794
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:53,075
Did you check up on his story?
- What's wrong with it?

795
00:54:53,175 --> 00:54:56,915
They're worth just 25 bucks apiece.
That's what's wrong with it.

796
00:54:57,015 --> 00:54:59,015
You're crazy.

797
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:03,075
If I weren't a gentleman...
- Well don't get sore.

798
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:06,065
Well then don't tell me I'm crazy.

799
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:14,075
I tell you the old boy's a phony.

800
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,795
His money isn't phony, is it?

801
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,635
He could borrow dough, or
have it stashed away...

802
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:20,755
Or even steal it.
- Chris steal?

803
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,875
Jeepers, Johnny, he's not the type.

804
00:55:22,975 --> 00:55:24,475
He wouldn't have nerve enough to steal.

805
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:26,155
Well he didn't get it from his pictures.

806
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:27,995
He may be dumb, but not about art.

807
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:29,900
The day he took me to the museum he
explained to me how everything was done.

808
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,955
You should have heard him. People stood
around and listened.

809
00:55:34,055 --> 00:55:36,555
What museum?
- The Metropolitan.

810
00:55:36,655 --> 00:55:41,245
Yipe. They've got pictures there
worth a million bucks.

811
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:47,135
Where you going?

812
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:53,995
I'm going to make a money
out of you, Lazy Legs.

813
00:55:54,095 --> 00:55:56,075
You can't take his pictures to the museum.

814
00:55:56,175 --> 00:55:58,175
Who says I can't?

815
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,115
You know who bought them?

816
00:56:14,215 --> 00:56:17,366
Janeway. Damon Janeway.

817
00:56:18,135 --> 00:56:20,395
Don't you know who Mr. Janeway is?
- No.

818
00:56:20,495 --> 00:56:22,495
He's an art critic.

819
00:56:22,495 --> 00:56:25,675
The best authority in New York
on Modern Art.

820
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:27,995
He took one look and bought them both.

821
00:56:28,095 --> 00:56:30,115
I couldn't even give him my pictures.

822
00:56:30,215 --> 00:56:31,355
Not for nothing.

823
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,155
He wants to get hold of you.

824
00:56:33,255 --> 00:56:35,835
He told me to telephone him.
You wait here, eh?

825
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,935
No, no...

826
00:56:52,415 --> 00:56:54,415
Sorry...

827
00:56:57,255 --> 00:56:59,435
For cat's sake, what's so funny?

828
00:56:59,535 --> 00:57:01,535
You are, Smarty-Pants.

829
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:04,435
You're the Mr. Fix-It who was gonna
make a monkey...

830
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:07,235
...out of poor dopey little Kitty...

831
00:57:07,335 --> 00:57:10,035
So you gave away two pictures
for a couple of dimes...

832
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:14,275
...and now you can't collect the dimes.
- Oh dry up.

833
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,969
Jeepers.
- Now what?

834
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,475
What am I gonna tell Chris?
- He won't find out.

835
00:57:19,575 --> 00:57:21,755
The heck he won't.
That Janeway's a crític...

836
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,275
...he writes for the newspaper.

837
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:26,195
Golly, you got us in a spot.
I told you not to do it.

838
00:57:26,295 --> 00:57:27,435
You're just nervous.

839
00:57:27,535 --> 00:57:29,675
The old guy that sold them
doesn't know me from Adam.

840
00:57:29,775 --> 00:57:32,580
Give me that drink, I can use it.

841
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:38,973
Chris?
- No, he's got a key.

842
00:57:40,815 --> 00:57:44,045
Well go ahead, see who it is.
Hurry up.

843
00:57:55,095 --> 00:57:56,355
I beg your pardon, but...

844
00:57:56,455 --> 00:57:58,835
...we're looking for a man,
and I'm afraid we don't know his name.

845
00:57:58,935 --> 00:58:01,655
And I'm afraid I can't help you.

846
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:04,115
I'm sorry...

847
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:06,215
Look.

848
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:11,335
There.

849
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,535
These are his.

850
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,875
Oh, there he is.

851
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:21,290
Why did you run away from me like that?

852
00:58:21,535 --> 00:58:24,652
Here, 50 dollars less 20 percent.

853
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,395
I don't know what you're talking about.

854
00:58:26,495 --> 00:58:27,795
But the pictures you brought me.

855
00:58:27,895 --> 00:58:30,595
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves:
My name is Janeway.

856
00:58:30,695 --> 00:58:32,675
This is Mr. Dellarowe.
- How do you do?

857
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:33,955
What is it you want?

858
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:36,715
We'd like to find out
who painted the pictures.

859
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:39,435
You don't know?
- Of course they don't know.

860
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:41,235
That's what we're here for.

861
00:58:41,335 --> 00:58:43,235
Look, if you're a friend of the painter,

862
00:58:43,335 --> 00:58:44,835
you'll put Mr. Dellarowe in touch with him.

863
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:48,035
Why'd you buy those pictures if you
didn't know who painted them?

864
00:58:48,135 --> 00:58:51,535
Because they're good.
- Who painted them?

865
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:01,115
No, Johnny, no.

866
00:59:01,215 --> 00:59:03,475
Oh don't be so modest, Miss March.

867
00:59:03,575 --> 00:59:05,435
Now you see? You got me in bad.

868
00:59:05,535 --> 00:59:07,435
She made me promise not to tell.

869
00:59:07,535 --> 00:59:11,020
That's why I made out like I didn't know.

870
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,275
She's funny about her painting.

871
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:18,315
Never lets anyone see it. Doesn't
even put her name on her pictures.

872
00:59:18,415 --> 00:59:19,595
So I observed.

873
00:59:19,695 --> 00:59:21,515
You're an extraordinary artist,
Miss March.

874
00:59:21,615 --> 00:59:23,195
Oh, no.
- See?

875
00:59:23,295 --> 00:59:25,275
She can't stand for anybody
to talk about her.

876
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,595
She got the idea her pictures
weren't any good.

877
00:59:27,695 --> 00:59:29,395
That's why I took those two to you...

878
00:59:29,495 --> 00:59:33,115
...to give her confidence...
I knew they were good.

879
00:59:33,215 --> 00:59:34,955
Now I'll take that money.

880
00:59:35,055 --> 00:59:37,675
I never would have guessed
it was a woman.

881
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:40,235
Nor I... You're work is
very strong, Miss March.

882
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:42,675
May we see some more of it?
- Sure... go ahead.

883
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:45,410
Look in her studio.
- Thank you.

884
00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:53,315
You're crazy to try a thing like this.

885
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:55,475
For cat's sake,
I thought they were cops.

886
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:57,675
I know what I'm doing...
they don't know from nothing.

887
00:59:57,775 --> 00:59:59,155
I can't fool that crític.

888
00:59:59,255 --> 01:00:01,635
You always wanted to be an actress...
Now's your chance.

889
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:04,515
You've been around the old boy
long enough to pick up his lingo...

890
01:00:04,615 --> 01:00:07,675
Feed Janeway some of that... I'll get
him in here alone with you.

891
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:09,775
No, no... wait.

892
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,715
How long has she been painting?

893
01:00:15,815 --> 01:00:17,600
Ever since she was a kid, Mr. Janeway.

894
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,595
Never went to art school, did she?
- No, she just picked it up...

895
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:23,075
I guess I'm the only one who's...

896
01:00:23,175 --> 01:00:25,115
...been encouraging her, kind of...

897
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,595
Helping her along... as a friend...
You know, just a friend.

898
01:00:28,695 --> 01:00:31,600
I didn't get your name.
- Prince.

899
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:37,968
Say Mr. Janeway... she's kind of upset.

900
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,690
Maybe you'd go in and talk to her?

901
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,300
Be glad to.

902
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,300
Well, Mr. Dellarowe?

903
01:00:54,135 --> 01:00:57,500
I wonder if Miss March would
let me have all of these?

904
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,700
Well that depends...

905
01:00:59,975 --> 01:01:02,600
What's in it for her?

906
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:06,985
Prices will have to be built up,
Mr. Prince, but...

907
01:01:16,555 --> 01:01:18,415
I can usually tell whether a canvas...

908
01:01:18,515 --> 01:01:20,895
...has been painted by a man or woman...

909
01:01:20,995 --> 01:01:22,950
But you fooled me completely,
Miss March.

910
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:26,500
Your work is not only original,
but has a masculine force.

911
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,340
How long does it take you
to paint a picture?

912
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:35,309
Sometimes a day... sometimes a year.

913
01:01:36,075 --> 01:01:38,975
You can't tell, it has to grow.
- Of course.

914
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:41,335
It's a matter of feeling, you know...

915
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:44,325
...how feeling grows? It's like...

916
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,425
Like falling in love, I guess.

917
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:51,495
That's a very good description.

918
01:01:51,595 --> 01:01:55,935
The way I look at it... Every painting,
if it's any good, is...

919
01:01:56,035 --> 01:01:58,035
...a love affair.

920
01:01:58,395 --> 01:02:00,175
May I quote that?
- Oh, no, no...

921
01:02:00,275 --> 01:02:01,735
Please don't write about me.

922
01:02:01,835 --> 01:02:04,735
I can see you're going to be
a very hard case.

923
01:02:04,835 --> 01:02:07,615
Why don't you have confidence
in your work?

924
01:02:07,715 --> 01:02:09,535
Because I can't draw.

925
01:02:09,635 --> 01:02:10,975
You do all right.

926
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:12,975
I just put a line around what I feel...

927
01:02:13,075 --> 01:02:15,200
...when I look at things.

928
01:02:16,475 --> 01:02:18,935
You're a very stimulating person to talk to.

929
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,585
How are you two getting along?

930
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:23,735
I think I'm breaking the ice.

931
01:02:23,835 --> 01:02:25,375
Kitty, Mr. Dellarowe wants to...

932
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:28,895
...handle all your work exclusively...
Is it all right?

933
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,855
As a friend I'd advise it.

934
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,575
Could you come to the galleries tomorrow?

935
01:02:32,675 --> 01:02:35,990
What time?
- Any time that's convenient.

936
01:02:36,155 --> 01:02:37,535
How about twelve o'clock?

937
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:39,415
And then lunch afterward with me.

938
01:02:39,515 --> 01:02:41,904
Well, I...

939
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,635
She'll be there.

940
01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:49,015
I'm glad you're around, Mr. Prince,
to make up her mind for her.

941
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:50,815
I can see you're tired, Miss March.

942
01:02:50,915 --> 01:02:52,535
This has been enough for one evening.

943
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,335
We'd better go. Until tomorrow?

944
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:57,070
Thanks, Mr. Janeway... so long.

945
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:58,535
Good evening.

946
01:02:58,635 --> 01:03:01,950
Good night, Mr. Dellarowe.
- Good night.

947
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:09,075
Good night.
- Good night.

948
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:16,835
Lazy Legs...

949
01:03:18,515 --> 01:03:19,975
I don't know what you told Janeway...

950
01:03:20,075 --> 01:03:21,575
...but you've got him eating
right out of your hand.

951
01:03:21,675 --> 01:03:23,375
It won't stop with lunch...

952
01:03:23,475 --> 01:03:25,855
Well, what's the difference?
- If you mean...

953
01:03:25,955 --> 01:03:28,760
Oh, stop acting like a green kid.

954
01:03:30,235 --> 01:03:33,615
Let him talk about what he wants to
talk about, and he won't talk about art.

955
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:37,030
If I had any sense I'd walk out on you.

956
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,310
You haven't got any sense.

957
01:03:56,195 --> 01:03:59,415
Right here... just like you'd sign a letter.

958
01:03:59,515 --> 01:04:01,515
Come on.

959
01:04:02,555 --> 01:04:04,595
Katherine March.
- Kitty?

960
01:04:05,035 --> 01:04:08,180
For cat's sake.... Put that one back.

961
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:10,195
Kitty?

962
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:16,490
Chris. - Oh, Kitty,
I happened to be in the neigh...

963
01:04:17,755 --> 01:04:20,827
Hello, Mr. Cross, I just dropped in.

964
01:04:20,915 --> 01:04:23,125
I thought Millie was here.

965
01:04:23,475 --> 01:04:26,575
Say, I hope you don't mind me
looking at your picture?

966
01:04:26,675 --> 01:04:28,935
Oh no, not at all, Mr. Prince.

967
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:32,265
Fine work, that's remarkable painting.

968
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,575
You have a little trouble with
perspective, don't you?

969
01:04:34,675 --> 01:04:39,055
Yes, that's one thing I could
never master: Perspective.

970
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:41,455
Well, I guess I'll have to run along.

971
01:04:41,555 --> 01:04:43,095
So long, Mr. Cross.

972
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:45,335
If Millie drops in, tell her
I'll be at Tiny's place.

973
01:04:45,435 --> 01:04:48,325
Don't bother, I'll let myself out.

974
01:04:55,835 --> 01:04:57,615
Has he been here long?

975
01:04:57,715 --> 01:04:59,715
No, why?

976
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,575
I don't like him. - Johnny's all right
He's a nice fellow, Chris. Really he is.

977
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:05,735
I don't know why you don't like him.

978
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,835
Well... was he the one?

979
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:10,015
One what?

980
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,335
Well you said there was one man...

981
01:05:11,435 --> 01:05:13,055
Oh for heaven's sake, won't you
ever forget that?

982
01:05:13,155 --> 01:05:14,295
Was he?
- No.

983
01:05:14,395 --> 01:05:15,615
Kitty...
- Go ahead and paint if you want to...

984
01:05:15,715 --> 01:05:20,730
I'm not going to stick around if
you're going to torment me.

985
01:05:54,355 --> 01:05:56,355
Kitty...

986
01:05:57,355 --> 01:05:58,815
Oh, Kitty...

987
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:02,655
Oh, leave me alone,
I'm going out for dinner.

988
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:07,135
Kitty, don't be angry.

989
01:06:07,235 --> 01:06:09,775
Why do you come here if you want to
quarrel? I didn't ask you to come here.

990
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,875
Oh, please Kitty.

991
01:06:12,075 --> 01:06:13,855
Oh, for Pete's sake.

992
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:16,549
Go and paint.
- I can't.

993
01:06:16,835 --> 01:06:20,575
I can't do a thing when
you're angry with me.

994
01:06:22,435 --> 01:06:24,435
Do you want me to go?

995
01:06:24,515 --> 01:06:27,405
I want you to stay here and paint.

996
01:06:36,475 --> 01:06:39,135
Chris... I'm sorry, Chris, but...

997
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:42,295
...why do you torment me about something
that's over and done with?

998
01:06:42,395 --> 01:06:44,395
Well, because I...

999
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:48,590
Would you marry me?
- You can't.

1000
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:51,295
Well, something might happen.
- What?

1001
01:06:51,395 --> 01:06:54,495
You better not let your wife
hear you talking like that.

1002
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:57,175
Of course I'd marry you if
you were free, but...

1003
01:06:57,275 --> 01:07:00,335
You're not, so... Let's not talk
about it. Now you go on and paint.

1004
01:07:00,435 --> 01:07:02,435
Could I paint you?

1005
01:07:04,275 --> 01:07:07,930
Well, I was going to do this myself, but...

1006
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:12,195
Paint me, Chris.

1007
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:25,080
There'll be masterpieces.

1008
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:11,295
Hello, Adele.

1009
01:08:11,395 --> 01:08:14,095
I dropped over to the butcher shop
like you told me to.

1010
01:08:14,195 --> 01:08:17,000
They got a nice piece of liver...

1011
01:08:20,795 --> 01:08:24,195
How long have you
known Katherine March?

1012
01:08:24,315 --> 01:08:26,315
Answer me.

1013
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:33,855
I don't know what you're talking
about. - How long have you known her?

1014
01:08:33,955 --> 01:08:36,495
Well now, don't get excited,
let me help you off with your coat.

1015
01:08:36,595 --> 01:08:39,935
You're the one who's excited... Look
at you. And keep away with that knife.

1016
01:08:40,035 --> 01:08:42,245
You want to cut my throat?

1017
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:47,735
How long have you known her?

1018
01:08:48,435 --> 01:08:51,215
I don't know what you're talking about
- Don't lie to me.

1019
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:53,295
You've been copying her work for years.

1020
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,375
Pretending you painted those pictures
out of your own head and all the time...

1021
01:08:55,475 --> 01:08:57,455
...you were just copying the work
of a real artist.

1022
01:08:57,555 --> 01:09:00,535
I'll bet you're at Dellarowe's
every day making notes.

1023
01:09:00,635 --> 01:09:02,635
Where?
- You know where.

1024
01:09:02,715 --> 01:09:05,175
Dellarowe's Art Gallery in 57th Street.

1025
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:08,655
They've got a window full of
paintings by Katherine March.

1026
01:09:08,755 --> 01:09:09,855
You're talking crazy.

1027
01:09:09,955 --> 01:09:13,935
She gets 500 dollars for a single
picture. She's a genius.

1028
01:09:14,035 --> 01:09:15,815
No wonder I used to think sometimes...

1029
01:09:15,915 --> 01:09:20,055
...there was something in your work...
Now I know why.

1030
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:21,735
If you ever do any more
painting around here

1031
01:09:21,835 --> 01:09:23,295
I swear I'll write that woman a letter...

1032
01:09:23,395 --> 01:09:26,735
...telling her you're stealing her ideas.

1033
01:09:26,835 --> 01:09:28,835
You're a thief.

1034
01:09:29,275 --> 01:09:35,565
Hogarth had better watch out... Or next
thing you'll be stealing his money.

1035
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,535
Not that one, Honey.

1036
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,895
Dellarowe's asking for more pictures...

1037
01:09:43,995 --> 01:09:46,175
Chris just finished it, he'll miss it.

1038
01:09:46,275 --> 01:09:49,095
Janeway says the new pictures are...

1039
01:09:49,195 --> 01:09:51,830
...the best things you've done.

1040
01:09:53,755 --> 01:09:56,015
Wasn't I right about Janeway,
Lazy Legs?

1041
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:57,775
Yeah, but he gets on my nerves.

1042
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,135
I been out to dinner with him
three times this week...

1043
01:10:00,235 --> 01:10:02,975
...and now he's talking about breakfast.

1044
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:04,895
He's getting that look in his eye...

1045
01:10:04,995 --> 01:10:06,975
All you gotta do is keep it there.

1046
01:10:07,075 --> 01:10:09,215
It's all very well for you to say...

1047
01:10:09,315 --> 01:10:11,375
...but what about the wear and
tear on my nerves?

1048
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:13,940
Papa will take care of Kitty.

1049
01:10:14,155 --> 01:10:17,470
Baby's gonna have a big diamond ring...

1050
01:10:17,795 --> 01:10:19,735
...and a shiny limousine...

1051
01:10:19,835 --> 01:10:22,555
...and a penthouse.
- And Johnny?

1052
01:10:23,195 --> 01:10:25,490
He goes with the penthouse.

1053
01:10:36,395 --> 01:10:38,395
Chris...

1054
01:10:40,635 --> 01:10:44,630
How did my pictures get into
Dellarowe's window?

1055
01:10:47,715 --> 01:10:49,715
Oh, Chris.

1056
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:51,880
Don't be angry with me...

1057
01:10:52,795 --> 01:10:55,615
No I'm not angry,
I just can't understand.

1058
01:10:55,715 --> 01:10:57,215
It's not possible.

1059
01:10:57,315 --> 01:10:59,295
Forgive me, Darling, I...

1060
01:10:59,395 --> 01:11:02,815
I needed money. They were
going to take the furniture back.

1061
01:11:02,915 --> 01:11:04,295
It was humiliating...

1062
01:11:04,395 --> 01:11:08,215
I couldn't ask you for more,
you've been so generous.

1063
01:11:08,315 --> 01:11:12,024
I just couldn't.
So I sold some pictures.

1064
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,875
To Dellarowe?
- Yes.

1065
01:11:16,275 --> 01:11:18,015
You actually sold those pictures?

1066
01:11:18,115 --> 01:11:19,735
Yes.

1067
01:11:19,835 --> 01:11:23,415
I know I shouldn't have
put my name on them but

1068
01:11:23,515 --> 01:11:26,535
Mr. Dellarowe wanted
to know who painted them...

1069
01:11:26,635 --> 01:11:29,735
...and I just couldn't give him your name.

1070
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:32,495
Now I can't tell him different... can I?

1071
01:11:32,595 --> 01:11:34,215
No.

1072
01:11:34,315 --> 01:11:39,175
The funny part is that it didn't seem
to make any difference.

1073
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:42,615
Yes, well the funny part is it
made a great deal of difference.

1074
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,775
If I'd brought those pictures
to a man like Dellarowe...

1075
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:46,815
...he wouldn't have taken them.

1076
01:11:46,915 --> 01:11:48,615
I'm a failure, Kitty.

1077
01:11:48,715 --> 01:11:51,605
Oh, you're a great painter, Chris.

1078
01:11:52,115 --> 01:11:55,855
Mr. Dellarowe said so and
so did Mr. Janeway.

1079
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,395
That is...

1080
01:11:59,595 --> 01:12:03,095
...they say I am.
- Well they're gonna keep on saying it.

1081
01:12:03,195 --> 01:12:05,255
Oh, Chris.
- Oh now don't...

1082
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:07,015
Don't Kitty, now don't cry.

1083
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,415
I'm happy....
Why, it's just like a dream.

1084
01:12:09,515 --> 01:12:12,427
Oh Chris, you're so good, so kind.

1085
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,575
What difference does it make whose
name is on those pictures...

1086
01:12:14,675 --> 01:12:16,495
...yours or mine?

1087
01:12:16,595 --> 01:12:19,495
Why, it's just like we were married.

1088
01:12:19,595 --> 01:12:21,595
Only I take your name.

1089
01:12:21,995 --> 01:12:26,245
Well, that gives me a little
authority around here.

1090
01:12:26,795 --> 01:12:30,960
I want to paint your picture, Kitty.
How about it?

1091
01:12:34,275 --> 01:12:36,275
Come with me.

1092
01:12:57,155 --> 01:13:01,490
Know what we're going to call this?
'Self-Portrait'.

1093
01:13:02,195 --> 01:13:07,223
DELLAROWE GALLERIES
EXHIBITION OF KATHERINE MARCH...

1094
01:13:42,755 --> 01:13:44,615
Hello, Damon.
- Hello, Ned.

1095
01:13:44,715 --> 01:13:45,935
Hello.

1096
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:48,815
Well. This is the first time that
I've ever agreed with you, Janeway.

1097
01:13:48,915 --> 01:13:49,975
Thank you.

1098
01:13:50,075 --> 01:13:53,735
I find the painter even more
fascinating than her paintings.

1099
01:13:53,835 --> 01:13:55,835
What's she like?

1100
01:13:55,955 --> 01:13:59,335
Mona Lisa without the smile...
Something hidden.

1101
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,375
Sometimes it seems as if she
were two people.

1102
01:14:02,475 --> 01:14:07,150
I mention that in my notice...
would you care to see it?

1103
01:14:25,675 --> 01:14:28,455
Mr. Cross, there's a man outside
who says he wants to see you.

1104
01:14:28,555 --> 01:14:30,175
Who?
- I didn't get no name, sir.

1105
01:14:30,275 --> 01:14:32,910
But he says he was a detective.

1106
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:03,925
You the detective?
- Well, I used to be, Mr. Cross.

1107
01:15:04,315 --> 01:15:06,315
Don't you recognize me?

1108
01:15:07,235 --> 01:15:09,235
No.

1109
01:15:12,355 --> 01:15:13,815
Homer.

1110
01:15:13,915 --> 01:15:15,415
Quite a shock, huh?

1111
01:15:15,515 --> 01:15:17,015
Now don't faint, Mr. Cross.

1112
01:15:17,115 --> 01:15:19,855
Keep your head.
I'll explain everything.

1113
01:15:19,955 --> 01:15:22,815
Well, I was in trouble at the time,
I'd been...

1114
01:15:22,915 --> 01:15:26,575
...collecting a little money from
the speakeasies along the waterfront.

1115
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:29,095
Word got around to headquarters.

1116
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:31,550
I was up for investigation.

1117
01:15:31,955 --> 01:15:33,335
One night I'm down by Brooklyn Bridge...

1118
01:15:33,435 --> 01:15:35,415
...trying to fix things up...

1119
01:15:35,515 --> 01:15:37,215
A man runs into the speakeasy and says:

1120
01:15:37,315 --> 01:15:39,535
'A woman just jumped off the bridge.'

1121
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,855
So I run out and tear off my coat,
jump in...

1122
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,895
The way I felt, I'm hoping
I don't come up again.

1123
01:15:46,995 --> 01:15:48,995
You mind?

1124
01:15:55,075 --> 01:15:58,135
Well, there I am, swimming
around in the dark...

1125
01:15:58,235 --> 01:16:01,375
I had hold of her hat once... the next
thing I know, I'm all tired out.

1126
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:03,735
I heard a tugboat whistle,
and right down on top of me...

1127
01:16:03,835 --> 01:16:06,429
...comes a coal barge...

1128
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,895
...so I grab ahold and climb aboard.

1129
01:16:08,995 --> 01:16:12,815
I look down at my hand,
and what do you think I got?

1130
01:16:12,915 --> 01:16:14,495
Her pocketbook.

1131
01:16:14,595 --> 01:16:17,735
That's what I grabbed ahold of
when I thought it was her hat.

1132
01:16:17,835 --> 01:16:21,874
And inside is 2700 dollars in folded money.

1133
01:16:22,475 --> 01:16:26,615
Imagine anyone committing suicide
with that much money.

1134
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,855
Well the coal barge unloaded
on a banana boat...

1135
01:16:28,955 --> 01:16:32,780
...bound for Honduras...
Well, I went with it.

1136
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,680
But if you're not dead...

1137
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:40,205
Then I'm not really married to Adele,
am I?

1138
01:16:44,035 --> 01:16:46,535
What's it worth it to you for me to...

1139
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:49,335
...keep my mouth shut and just...

1140
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:51,435
...fade away?

1141
01:16:51,635 --> 01:16:52,735
Yes but...

1142
01:16:52,835 --> 01:16:55,215
If you're Adele's husband...

1143
01:16:56,155 --> 01:17:00,660
Wait a minute. I can see you need Adele.
I need money.

1144
01:17:01,635 --> 01:17:02,815
You're a cashier...

1145
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:06,815
...it ought to be easy for you to get
your hands on a couple of thousand...

1146
01:17:06,915 --> 01:17:10,995
Well, I... I... I couldn't do a thing like that.

1147
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,215
You're going back to her?
- No.

1148
01:17:15,315 --> 01:17:17,775
But not to do you a favor, Mister.

1149
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,765
I'm clearing out for Adele's sake.

1150
01:17:22,635 --> 01:17:25,535
And don't think you're gonna get
any peace of mind, either.

1151
01:17:25,635 --> 01:17:28,185
I might turn up again someday.

1152
01:17:28,715 --> 01:17:32,795
She'd kick you out in a minute
for a man like me.

1153
01:17:35,475 --> 01:17:37,515
I'll get you some money.

1154
01:17:37,755 --> 01:17:39,615
Now you're using your head.

1155
01:17:39,715 --> 01:17:41,215
But you'll have to wait here.

1156
01:17:41,315 --> 01:17:44,135
I can't get it until after we
close at six o'clock.

1157
01:17:44,235 --> 01:17:46,235
I'll wait, Cross.

1158
01:17:48,075 --> 01:17:50,295
Hello, Johnny. Hello, Kitty.
- Hiya, Marchetti.

1159
01:17:50,395 --> 01:17:52,395
Hi.

1160
01:17:53,555 --> 01:17:55,815
Don't forget the champagne, Baby.

1161
01:17:55,915 --> 01:17:58,695
Nice car you have, Johnny.
She go fast, eh?

1162
01:17:58,795 --> 01:18:01,215
I'd like to see any cop trying to catch me.

1163
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:03,815
Say, I'll give you four bits
for a bucket full of that ice...

1164
01:18:03,915 --> 01:18:05,915
Okay, Johnny.

1165
01:18:10,955 --> 01:18:12,775
Can I borrow the icepick?

1166
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:15,765
You give it back, eh?
- Sure, sure.

1167
01:18:17,835 --> 01:18:19,835
Thank you.

1168
01:18:22,555 --> 01:18:24,555
Only 200?

1169
01:18:24,635 --> 01:18:26,895
Well, that's all I could get.

1170
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:30,650
Don't you think your wife's more than that?

1171
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:35,495
Look, I want you to get all
that's coming to you, Mr. Higgins.

1172
01:18:35,595 --> 01:18:37,215
Now what about the insurance money?

1173
01:18:37,315 --> 01:18:38,295
The insurance?

1174
01:18:38,395 --> 01:18:40,909
2000 dollars... on your life.

1175
01:18:41,195 --> 01:18:44,895
Adele collected it.
It's really yours, isn't it?

1176
01:18:44,995 --> 01:18:46,775
She keeps it right in her bedroom.

1177
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:50,255
Now I wouldn't touch a penny of it,
Mr. Higgins, but...

1178
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:53,855
...if you took it,
it would be perfectly legal.

1179
01:18:53,955 --> 01:18:57,525
But just how would I get it?
- That's easy.

1180
01:18:58,235 --> 01:19:01,335
This is the night that she
always goes out to the movies.

1181
01:19:01,435 --> 01:19:04,666
I let you in, you take the money...

1182
01:19:05,835 --> 01:19:07,835
I let you out.

1183
01:19:09,275 --> 01:19:10,815
But why don't you get it?

1184
01:19:10,915 --> 01:19:14,135
Why, I've got to be able to
say that I didn't touch it.

1185
01:19:14,235 --> 01:19:16,235
You know Adele...

1186
01:19:20,115 --> 01:19:22,410
What if she don't go out...

1187
01:19:22,715 --> 01:19:26,965
...and I show up...
Your goose is cooked, isn't it?

1188
01:19:27,235 --> 01:19:29,235
Yes, but...

1189
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:32,150
I can play it safe.
- How?

1190
01:19:33,075 --> 01:19:37,750
Well, you come along the street
at 11 o'clock tonight...

1191
01:20:24,755 --> 01:20:26,135
Okay?

1192
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:28,895
Why are you whispering?
How come the lights are out?

1193
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:32,735
Mrs. Michaels. You remember
Mrs. Michaels, don't you?

1194
01:20:32,835 --> 01:20:35,300
Oh, yeah.
- And the neighbors.

1195
01:20:42,395 --> 01:20:43,775
Where is the money?

1196
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:47,785
In there... in the bottom drawer of the chest.

1197
01:20:49,155 --> 01:20:51,620
Okay, give me the flashlight.

1198
01:21:02,435 --> 01:21:04,215
Police.

1199
01:21:04,315 --> 01:21:06,055
Murder.

1200
01:21:06,155 --> 01:21:07,815
Christopher.

1201
01:21:07,915 --> 01:21:10,635
Christopher, turn on the lights.

1202
01:21:36,355 --> 01:21:38,355
Johnny.

1203
01:21:38,795 --> 01:21:40,795
Oh, Johnny.
- Lazy Legs.

1204
01:21:40,835 --> 01:21:42,835
Jeepers, I love you.

1205
01:21:47,555 --> 01:21:49,555
What's that?

1206
01:21:58,115 --> 01:22:00,115
Chris?

1207
01:22:07,955 --> 01:22:11,185
Johnny, is it Chris?
- Call him, quick.

1208
01:22:12,115 --> 01:22:13,975
Chris.

1209
01:22:14,075 --> 01:22:15,255
Chris.

1210
01:22:15,355 --> 01:22:16,815
I ought to push you over on your head.

1211
01:22:16,915 --> 01:22:20,015
How did I know he was coming here
tonight? I don't understand it.

1212
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:22,375
You don't understand anything.
- But why get sore at me?

1213
01:22:22,475 --> 01:22:25,175
Well what are the use of my brains if
I'm tied up with a dumb cluck like you?

1214
01:22:25,275 --> 01:22:27,735
I told you to watch your step,
didn't I? - Right, blame it on me.

1215
01:22:27,835 --> 01:22:30,135
Oh why did you keep me here tonight?
I didn't want to stay.

1216
01:22:30,235 --> 01:22:32,455
Johnny. Don't talk like that.

1217
01:22:32,555 --> 01:22:34,495
Well it's the truth,
I'm fed up with you.

1218
01:22:34,595 --> 01:22:35,655
Johnny.

1219
01:22:35,755 --> 01:22:41,110
That's the only thing you ever
understood, I'm through with you.

1220
01:22:51,935 --> 01:22:54,315
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1221
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:04,475
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1222
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:10,475
Oh Lord, have mercy upon us sinners.

1223
01:23:10,655 --> 01:23:13,595
The way of the sinner
is made plain with stones.

1224
01:23:13,695 --> 01:23:17,265
But at the end thereof is the pit of Hell.

1225
01:23:17,615 --> 01:23:21,244
Oh Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner.

1226
01:23:21,655 --> 01:23:24,715
Hallelujah. Amen.
- Hallelujah. Amen.

1227
01:23:28,455 --> 01:23:31,515
Millie? Yeah, Kitty.
You seen Johnny?

1228
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:36,075
Oh, I thought he'd go to Tiny's.
Was he getting tight?

1229
01:23:36,175 --> 01:23:37,675
Oh, just a fight.

1230
01:23:37,775 --> 01:23:39,315
Listen, he can't live without me...

1231
01:23:39,415 --> 01:23:41,515
...any more than I can live without him.

1232
01:23:41,615 --> 01:23:44,755
Said he was coming back here?
To beat me up?

1233
01:23:44,855 --> 01:23:48,765
Jeepers, the way that guy
shoots off his mouth.

1234
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:51,835
Oh you don't have to warn me,
that's just the way he talks.

1235
01:23:51,935 --> 01:23:55,250
If you were in love you'd understand...

1236
01:23:55,255 --> 01:23:58,485
Oh stop it.
Johnny wouldn't kill a fly.

1237
01:23:59,815 --> 01:24:01,815
That's love, Honey.

1238
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,555
Here he is now.
And has he got a bun on...

1239
01:24:06,655 --> 01:24:08,075
Goodbye, Hon.

1240
01:24:08,175 --> 01:24:10,175
Hello, Johnny.

1241
01:24:12,735 --> 01:24:15,200
Come on, Johnny, I heard you.

1242
01:24:27,255 --> 01:24:29,255
You lied to me, Kitty.

1243
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:31,475
It was him, wasn't it?

1244
01:24:31,575 --> 01:24:34,040
Can I help it if I'm in love?

1245
01:24:34,895 --> 01:24:37,360
No, it's just an infatuation.

1246
01:24:37,495 --> 01:24:40,980
You couldn't love a man like that, Kitty.

1247
01:24:41,255 --> 01:24:43,255
He's evil.

1248
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:47,030
He wouldn't let you alone,
isn't that right?

1249
01:24:48,055 --> 01:24:50,055
I wanted to kill him.

1250
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:51,715
But it's wrong.

1251
01:24:51,815 --> 01:24:53,815
Why did you come here?

1252
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,435
To ask you to marry me.
- And what about your wife?

1253
01:24:57,535 --> 01:24:59,475
I haven't any wife, that's finished.
- For cat's sake, you didn't...

1254
01:24:59,575 --> 01:25:02,295
Her husband turned up, I'm free.

1255
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:07,528
Oh now... don't cry, Kitty.

1256
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:11,635
I know how you feel,
but that's all over now.

1257
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:16,075
We all make mistakes.
I don't care what's happened, I...

1258
01:25:16,175 --> 01:25:17,955
I can marry you now, I...

1259
01:25:18,055 --> 01:25:19,675
I want you to be my wife.

1260
01:25:19,775 --> 01:25:22,795
We'll go away together,
away far off, so...

1261
01:25:22,895 --> 01:25:25,445
You can forget this other man.

1262
01:25:25,775 --> 01:25:28,665
Don't cry, Kitty.
Please don't cry.

1263
01:25:29,455 --> 01:25:32,275
I'm not crying you fool, I'm laughing.

1264
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:34,375
Kitty...

1265
01:25:34,535 --> 01:25:37,715
Oh you idiot, how can a man be so dumb?

1266
01:25:37,815 --> 01:25:39,815
Kitty...

1267
01:25:43,535 --> 01:25:45,900
I've wanted to laugh in your face
ever since I first met you.

1268
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,500
You're old and ugly...

1269
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,635
...and I'm sick of you.
Sick. Sick. Sick.

1270
01:25:50,735 --> 01:25:51,800
Kitty, for Heaven sake.

1271
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,909
You kill Johnny?
I'd like to see you try.

1272
01:25:55,009 --> 01:25:58,000
Why, he'd break every bone in your body.
He's a man.

1273
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,715
You wanna marry me, you?.

1274
01:25:59,815 --> 01:26:01,940
Get out of here. Get out.

1275
01:26:02,055 --> 01:26:04,315
Get away from me. Chris. Chris.

1276
01:26:04,415 --> 01:26:05,755
Get away from me. Chris.

1277
01:26:05,855 --> 01:26:07,855
Chris.

1278
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,684
Hey.

1279
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:27,140
You better look out, Johnny.
You'll kill somebody.

1280
01:28:06,855 --> 01:28:08,855
Chris.

1281
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:36,405
Hold on, Chris, wait a minute.

1282
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,695
What made you do it, Chris?

1283
01:28:40,775 --> 01:28:43,075
When these officers called me,
I wouldn't believe it.

1284
01:28:43,175 --> 01:28:45,995
We were tipped off on the telephone.
- By a man named Higgins.

1285
01:28:46,095 --> 01:28:49,155
I checked the cash before you came in.

1286
01:28:49,255 --> 01:28:51,720
You know how much is missing?

1287
01:28:52,295 --> 01:28:55,075
Over 1200 dollars.
- We'll take him along.

1288
01:28:55,175 --> 01:28:56,355
You can make the complaint, Mr. Hogarth.

1289
01:28:56,455 --> 01:28:58,455
Hold on, Morris.

1290
01:28:59,135 --> 01:29:01,115
I just can't do it.
- But Mr. Hogarth...

1291
01:29:01,215 --> 01:29:04,595
I know you've done your duty
and I'm obliged to you.

1292
01:29:04,695 --> 01:29:07,275
There's a box of cigars on the table,
take them along with you.

1293
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:10,265
Okay, Mr. Hogarth, it's up to you.

1294
01:29:18,455 --> 01:29:21,260
Chris, it was a woman, wasn't it?

1295
01:29:22,175 --> 01:29:24,175
I thought so.

1296
01:29:24,935 --> 01:29:27,155
I'm not going to put you in jail, Chris...

1297
01:29:27,255 --> 01:29:30,060
...only of course you're through.

1298
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,900
Well I didn't do anything.
I want a law...

1299
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I want a lawyer.

1300
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,550
Where was he picked up?
- Riverside Drive.

1301
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,100
He tried to get away in the
murdered girl's car.

1302
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,200
That was my car.

1303
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:06,635
This is yours, too.

1304
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:10,815
It's got your initials on it,
but it's her blood.

1305
01:30:11,095 --> 01:30:13,915
Here's 140 dollars that was taken
out of her pocketbook.

1306
01:30:14,015 --> 01:30:16,015
That was mine.

1307
01:30:16,975 --> 01:30:20,800
It's her diamond ring, worth
5 or 600 dollars.

1308
01:30:22,935 --> 01:30:25,195
You guys know a lot, don't you?

1309
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:27,295
It cost 1200.

1310
01:30:28,175 --> 01:30:30,470
These are personal jewelry.

1311
01:30:31,215 --> 01:30:33,995
Not much value, but he cleaned her out.

1312
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:39,535
But why wouldn't I? She didn't
have any more use for it, did she?

1313
01:30:42,535 --> 01:30:43,595
Listen you guys, I want a lawyer.

1314
01:30:43,695 --> 01:30:46,330
I'm a citizen, I got my rights.

1315
01:30:48,255 --> 01:30:50,275
This belongs to you too, huh?

1316
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,355
It's got your fingerprints on it.

1317
01:30:52,455 --> 01:30:54,155
Well naturally, I picked it up.

1318
01:30:54,255 --> 01:30:55,635
How did I know she was dead?

1319
01:30:55,735 --> 01:30:58,710
I thought she was asleep, at first.

1320
01:31:01,175 --> 01:31:03,435
She didn't paint those pictures.

1321
01:31:03,535 --> 01:31:07,400
Old Cross isn't as dumb as he looks.
He painted them.

1322
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,675
The accused brought me two pictures.

1323
01:31:09,775 --> 01:31:12,600
He told me Miss March painted them.

1324
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,000
In my expert opinion, there's
no doubt about it...

1325
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:18,155
She was a very great artist.

1326
01:31:18,255 --> 01:31:19,400
She told me she was an artist...

1327
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,310
...when she rented the studio,
he was with her.

1328
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,800
I didn't like him then
and I don't like him now.

1329
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,075
Yeah, he was mean when he was drunk.

1330
01:31:27,175 --> 01:31:30,500
He said he was gonna fix her when
he left my place around 2 a. m.

1331
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,795
That's when I tell him:

1332
01:31:31,895 --> 01:31:33,995
'You look out, Johnny,
you're gonna kill somebody.'

1333
01:31:34,095 --> 01:31:35,995
So he kills her with my icepick.

1334
01:31:36,095 --> 01:31:38,800
And then I heard her say
'Hello, Johnny', before she hung up.

1335
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,940
He was there, all right.

1336
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:43,300
But what I don't understand is this
talk about her being an artist.

1337
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,900
I never saw her paint.

1338
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,900
That was one of her peculiar traits:

1339
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,275
She never let anyone see her paint.

1340
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:51,635
I've compared her handwriting
with her signature.

1341
01:31:51,735 --> 01:31:53,275
There's no question.

1342
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:55,605
Mr. Cross paint?

1343
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:58,795
He only copied her work. He's a thief.

1344
01:31:58,895 --> 01:32:02,875
He stole from me, from his employer,
from Katherine March.

1345
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:06,545
My wife, I mean my former wife,
is correct.

1346
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,700
I really can't paint.

1347
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,475
My copies were so bad I
had to destroy them.

1348
01:32:13,575 --> 01:32:15,870
For cat's sake. He's lying.

1349
01:32:27,215 --> 01:32:29,445
Hello, Mr. Cross.
- Hello.

1350
01:32:30,055 --> 01:32:32,350
Tom Crocker, Evening Globe.

1351
01:32:32,535 --> 01:32:34,275
Oh yes, Tom Crocker.

1352
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:36,755
Joe Williams, Morning World...
Conway's with the Ledger.

1353
01:32:36,855 --> 01:32:38,855
Hello.

1354
01:32:39,055 --> 01:32:41,055
Cigarette?
- No thanks.

1355
01:32:41,215 --> 01:32:42,595
Going to Sing Sing?

1356
01:32:42,695 --> 01:32:44,995
Yeah. I don't like to cover executions...

1357
01:32:45,095 --> 01:32:47,075
...but I must say this is one I don't mind.

1358
01:32:47,175 --> 01:32:48,635
You sure cooked County's goose,
Mr. Cross...

1359
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:51,155
...when you testified you couldn't paint.

1360
01:32:51,255 --> 01:32:52,795
Nobody cooked County's goose
except Johnny...

1361
01:32:52,895 --> 01:32:54,955
...the way he shot off his mouth.

1362
01:32:55,055 --> 01:32:58,235
He was a dead pigeon when he dragged
the girl's name through the mud.

1363
01:32:58,335 --> 01:32:59,795
I watched the jury.

1364
01:32:59,895 --> 01:33:02,835
If he'd kept his trap shut, he might
have got off with his life.

1365
01:33:02,935 --> 01:33:04,435
Sure, the evidence was only circumstantial.

1366
01:33:04,535 --> 01:33:07,395
What do you mean?
He got a fair trial, didn't he?

1367
01:33:07,495 --> 01:33:09,515
Yeah, but there's always a doubt.

1368
01:33:09,615 --> 01:33:12,475
I suppose you fellas are going to say
it was a miscarriage of justice.

1369
01:33:12,575 --> 01:33:14,995
That someone is getting
away with murder?

1370
01:33:15,095 --> 01:33:17,115
Not me, there's no such thing.

1371
01:33:17,215 --> 01:33:20,155
Mr. Cross, nobody gets away with murder.

1372
01:33:20,255 --> 01:33:23,075
How's that?
- Oh, don't get him started.

1373
01:33:23,175 --> 01:33:27,085
He'll talk your ear off,
that's his pet theory.

1374
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:29,275
All right, go ahead and laugh all you like.

1375
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,195
But no one escapes punishment.

1376
01:33:31,295 --> 01:33:34,235
I figure we have a little
courtroom right in here:

1377
01:33:34,335 --> 01:33:36,715
Judge, jury and executioner.

1378
01:33:38,015 --> 01:33:39,395
I don't get it.

1379
01:33:39,495 --> 01:33:42,035
Murder never solves anything,
how about it, fellas?

1380
01:33:42,135 --> 01:33:43,195
You've covered lots of trials.

1381
01:33:43,295 --> 01:33:45,475
I'm sorry, but I have to admit you're right.

1382
01:33:45,575 --> 01:33:48,435
The problem just moves in here
where it can never get out.

1383
01:33:48,535 --> 01:33:51,255
Right here in solitary. So what?

1384
01:33:51,255 --> 01:33:53,275
So you go right on punishing yourself.

1385
01:33:53,375 --> 01:33:56,265
You can't get away with it. Never.

1386
01:33:56,455 --> 01:33:58,275
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

1387
01:33:58,375 --> 01:34:01,155
Well you haven't seen as much of
murder as I have, Mr. Cross.

1388
01:34:01,255 --> 01:34:07,375
I'd rather have the judge give me the
works than have to do it to myself.

1389
01:34:10,055 --> 01:34:13,030
What time do they throw the switch?

1390
01:34:14,535 --> 01:34:16,535
11 o'clock.

1391
01:34:50,695 --> 01:34:53,315
I didn't do it,
I tell you I didn't do it.

1392
01:34:53,415 --> 01:34:55,115
Won't anyone believe me?

1393
01:34:55,215 --> 01:34:57,355
Give me a break, somebody.
I never got a square deal in my life.

1394
01:34:57,455 --> 01:35:01,025
Won't somebody,
somebody give me a break...

1395
01:36:03,335 --> 01:36:04,715
Johnny.

1396
01:36:04,815 --> 01:36:06,815
Johnny.

1397
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:09,375
Oh, Johnny. Johnny.

1398
01:36:11,935 --> 01:36:14,529
<i>Lazy Legs, Lazy Legs...</i>

1399
01:36:14,695 --> 01:36:17,115
<i>Johnny darling... Johnny darling...</i>

1400
01:36:17,215 --> 01:36:21,125
<i>I'm here, baby...
Jeepers I love you, Johnny...</i>

1401
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:24,735
<i>Johnny.</i>

1402
01:36:26,535 --> 01:36:29,368
<i>Lazy Legs, Lazy Legs...</i>

1403
01:36:29,455 --> 01:36:32,367
<i>Jeepers I love you, Johnny...</i>

1404
01:36:55,255 --> 01:36:58,645
<i>Oh Johnny, now we're together...</i>

1405
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,435
<i>Yeah... He killed me too, Kitty...</i>

1406
01:37:03,535 --> 01:37:06,195
<i>He brought us together, Johnny...</i>

1407
01:37:06,295 --> 01:37:08,295
<i>Forever...</i>

1408
01:37:08,775 --> 01:37:10,035
Kitty...

1409
01:37:10,135 --> 01:37:13,155
<i>Oh you idiot, how can a man be so dumb?</i>

1410
01:37:13,255 --> 01:37:14,995
No, Kitty, no.

1411
01:37:15,095 --> 01:37:17,315
<i>You wanted to marry me? You?</i>

1412
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:20,390
<i>She's mine, Chris, mine... forever.</i>

1413
01:37:20,455 --> 01:37:22,455
Leave me alone.

1414
01:37:23,135 --> 01:37:26,555
<i>You killed me, Chris, you're old
and ugly and you killed me...</i>

1415
01:37:26,655 --> 01:37:29,595
<i>You killed me, you killed me,
you killed me.</i>

1416
01:37:29,695 --> 01:37:31,695
No, Kitty, it's him.

1417
01:37:31,935 --> 01:37:35,395
You were innocent, you were pure, that's
what he killed in you. He's the murderer

1418
01:37:35,495 --> 01:37:37,475
<i>No, he's not. Not Johnny.</i>

1419
01:37:37,575 --> 01:37:40,373
<i>You see, Chris? She loves me...</i>

1420
01:37:40,655 --> 01:37:44,905
That's why you had to die.
You're the one I killed.

1421
01:37:45,135 --> 01:37:47,135
<i>She's mine, Chris.</i>

1422
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:50,095
<i>You kill Johnny?</i>

1423
01:37:50,135 --> 01:37:52,075
<i>I'd like to see you try.
- Kitty...</i>

1424
01:37:52,175 --> 01:37:54,395
<i>He'd break every bone in your body.
- Kitty.</i>

1425
01:37:54,495 --> 01:37:56,495
<i>He's a man.
- Kitty.</i>

1426
01:38:09,255 --> 01:38:11,610
<i>Johnny... Johnny...</i>

1427
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:15,363
<i>Oh, Johnny.... Johnny.</i>

1428
01:38:19,055 --> 01:38:21,435
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1429
01:38:27,855 --> 01:38:30,660
There's something wrong in there.

1430
01:38:54,895 --> 01:38:58,295
It's all right old man,
it's all right...

1431
01:38:58,295 --> 01:39:00,295
<i>Johnny.</i>

1432
01:39:00,335 --> 01:39:02,335
<i>Oh Johnny.</i>

1433
01:39:02,575 --> 01:39:04,955
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1434
01:39:27,415 --> 01:39:30,135
Get up, come on, get up, get up.

1435
01:39:31,735 --> 01:39:33,735
Oh, it's you.

1436
01:39:33,735 --> 01:39:35,555
Haven't I told you to keep out of this park?

1437
01:39:35,655 --> 01:39:38,035
You know the Mayor's orders.

1438
01:39:46,295 --> 01:39:49,950
Get on down to the Bowery,
where you belong.

1439
01:39:50,335 --> 01:39:52,335
Come on, come on.

1440
01:40:03,175 --> 01:40:04,875
Who's that rick?

1441
01:40:04,975 --> 01:40:06,675
He has a crazy idea he killed
a couple of people...

1442
01:40:06,775 --> 01:40:09,475
...five or six years ago.
Can't get it off his mind.

1443
01:40:09,575 --> 01:40:12,380
Always trying to give himself up.

1444
01:40:13,575 --> 01:40:18,080
Wants to be tried and executed...
you know these nuts.

1445
01:41:02,655 --> 01:41:05,460
Well, there goes her masterpiece.

1446
01:41:11,175 --> 01:41:13,035
I really hate to part with it.

1447
01:41:13,135 --> 01:41:18,405
For 10,000 dollars I shouldn't
think you'd mind, Mr. Dellarowe.

1448
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:34,375
<i>Johnny.</i>

1449
01:41:36,295 --> 01:41:38,295
<i>Oh Johnny.</i>

1450
01:41:40,215 --> 01:41:42,285
<i>Lazy Legs.</i>

1451
01:41:45,295 --> 01:41:47,675
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>
