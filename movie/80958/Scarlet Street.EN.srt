1
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:39,607
Well boys, I hate
to break up a good party...

2
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,289
but you can't keep
a woman waiting, can you?

3
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:44,724
- You know how it is, boys.
- Yes we do, Mr. Hogarth.

4
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,925
- That's right, JJ.
- I'll say you can't, JJ.

5
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:49,965
I see you can all understand, all right.

6
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:55,365
Well believe you me, boys,
I've had the time of my life tonight.

7
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:58,525
And speaking of time, I have here

8
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,492
a 14-karat 17-jewel timepiece.

9
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,048
And that's only right, because

10
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,571
the man I'm giving it to
is a 14-karat 17-jewel cashier.

11
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,646
- Hear hear!
- Hear hear!

12
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:13,374
Pass it along to him, boys.

13
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:17,084
- That's a beautiful watch, JJ.
- It's wonderful!

14
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:20,924
Chris.

15
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,451
Read what's engraved inside, Chris.

16
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,774
To my friend Christopher Cross...

17
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:39,970
...in token of 25 years
of faithful service,...

18
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:45,644
...from JJ Hogarth, 1909-1934.

19
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,649
Speech! Speech!

20
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,449
- Speak up, Chris, speak up.
- Come on, Chris, speech!

21
00:03:52,655 --> 00:03:53,929
Well I...

22
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,766
...I hardly know what to say, JJ.

23
00:03:57,575 --> 00:04:00,612
This... why, it's beautiful.

24
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:04,883
I never expected to own
a watch like this.

25
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,293
No sir, I...

26
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:10,330
Well... all I can say is that

27
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,645
we've got the best boss in New York.

28
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Good going, friend.

29
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:29,894
Congratulations, old boy,
congratulations!

30
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:31,567
Good boy, good boy!

31
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:35,728
Thank you, Chris.
Thank you, my old friend.

32
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,891
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

33
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:41,811
- Have a smoke before I go.
- Well, I... don't usually, JJ.

34
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,613
Go ahead and try it.

35
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:45,730
It's made special for me.
A dollar apiece.

36
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,684
- Here, Charlie.
- Oh, thanks.

37
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,243
Thank you.

38
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:01,726
You're not supersticious,
are you, Chris?

39
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:03,686
No, no, no sir, no sir.

40
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,326
Now don't break up a good party,
just because I've got to go.

41
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,248
Everything is charged to JJ.

42
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,651
That's very nice of you, boss.

43
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:14,494
You can drink all you want...

44
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:17,806
only don't come in late Monday
morning with a hangover!

45
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,967
Good night, boys.

46
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,283
Good night!

47
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,604
- Aren't you a lucky dog. - I'll
treasure this for the rest of my life.

48
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,174
I'll bet you will.

49
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:38,490
Hey fellas, look!
Look, come here!

50
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:41,165
Hurry!

51
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,973
Get a load of that dame.

52
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:54,488
That's JJ's wife?

53
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,891
The boss is stepping out!

54
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,291
- If I had his dough, I'd step out too.
- Must be a load of laundry tonight!

55
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,610
There's nothing
like the smell of spring.

56
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:16,094
Which way do you go, Chris?

57
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:18,606
I guess I'll take the East Side subway.

58
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,686
It gets me to Brooklyn a little quicker.

59
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,853
Hey, you haven't got an umbrella!
No, I'll take you to your bus.

60
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:29,654
- No, it's out of your way.
- I don't mind walking.

61
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:31,726
The fresh air, the spring.

62
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:35,253
I'm a little drunk.

63
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,763
Never mind, I'll catch the next one.

64
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:56,254
You go on over to the subway.

65
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:59,054
No, I don't mind waiting,
I feel kind of lonely tonight.

66
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:04,609
Say, Charlie...

67
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:08,729
You suppose JJ is running around
with that young lady?

68
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:10,574
It looks that way.

69
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:16,243
- I wonder what it's like.
- What, Chris?

70
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:20,451
To be loved by a young girl like that.

71
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,567
You know, nobody ever looked at me
like that, not even when I was young.

72
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:27,929
Yes, when we're young we have
dreams that never pan out...

73
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,210
but we go on dreaming.

74
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,685
When I was young,
I wanted to be an artist.

75
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:36,007
I dreamt I was going to be a
great painter someday.

76
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:38,006
So I'm a cashier.

77
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,690
- Do you still paint?
- Yes, every Sunday.

78
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:42,766
That's one way to kill time.

79
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:45,050
You know, Sunday is the one day
of the week I don't like.

80
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:46,250
I never know what to do with myself.

81
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,974
- Why don't you come over tomorrow and
see me? - Thanks, Chris, I'll do that.

82
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,651
- Good night, Chris.
- Good night, Charlie. See you tomorrow.

83
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,009
Good night.

84
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,286
- It stopped raining.
- Yeah, half an hour ago.

85
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,172
Which way is it to the East Side subway?

86
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:19,973
Around the corner, past the "L",

87
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:22,444
- four blocks.
- Thank you, Officer.

88
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,524
I guess I got turned around.

89
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,685
These streets are all mixed up
in Greenwich Village. - Yeah.

90
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:13,594
Is he hurt?

91
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,913
- I'll go call a policeman.
- No, wait... wait!

92
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,270
Officer!

93
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:31,230
Officer!

94
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:47,793
- Where did they go?
- In that direction.

95
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,828
- What does he look like?
- I don't know.

96
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,071
- I didn't see his face.
- He took 15 dollars.

97
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:55,430
He didn't believe it was all
I had, so he began pushing me around...

98
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,506
and this gentleman ran in
and knocked him down.

99
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,153
That's right, Officer,
he was right there.

100
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:01,271
I couldn't hold him, he got up and ran.

101
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:02,549
Wait here.

102
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,027
Come on, let's get out of here.

103
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:07,514
But we have to wait for the officer.

104
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:09,631
I don't want to get my name
in the newspaper, do you?

105
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:10,864
- The newspaper?
- Sure.

106
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:12,547
We'll have to go down to the
station house and make a complaint.

107
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:14,034
And every time they make an arrest,
they send a detective to your house...

108
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:16,151
...for weeks. Oh, it's a nuisance.

109
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:20,308
- Won't you take me home?
- Why, yes...

110
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:24,474
Well, sure... that is...
if you think that...

111
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,031
Well, here's where I live.

112
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,145
I'm sorry I can't ask you to come up.

113
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,466
I share my apartment
with another girl, Millie.

114
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:41,750
Good night, and thanks for everything.

115
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:44,630
Don't you...

116
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:47,305
don't you want a cup of coffee?

117
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:49,863
All right.

118
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,307
- Hello, Kitty.
- Hello, Tiny.

119
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,873
- Oh, this is Mr...
- Cross.

120
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,707
- Glad to know you, Mr. Cross.
- How do you do.

121
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:16,023
You seen Johnny?

122
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,347
No, not since he left here.

123
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,909
- Two coffees, please.
- I think I changed my mind.

124
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:24,713
I could stand a drink-a Rum Collins.

125
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:27,229
- One Rum Collins?
- Yes, yes.

126
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,910
Oh come on, keep me company.

127
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:33,991
Well, you see I've already had
a good deal of champagne...

128
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:35,753
- You want champagne?
- No, no...

129
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:39,387
Make mine the same.

130
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:44,464
You know, ever since I first saw you
I was wondering what your name was.

131
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:47,351
- Kitty.
- It's really-

132
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:52,065
Katherine, Katherine March.

133
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:54,825
My friends call me Kitty.

134
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,666
What do your friends call you?

135
00:11:58,955 --> 00:11:59,944
Chris.

136
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,466
Chris Cross.

137
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:05,314
Chris Cross!

138
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,704
Yes, the boys tease me about it, but

139
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,194
I don't mind.

140
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,432
Why are you looking at me?

141
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,633
Is my face dirty?

142
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,623
It's beautiful.

143
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,787
I'll bet it is.

144
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,752
Gee, I'm a sight!

145
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,874
Thank you, sir.

146
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:44,068
Cheers, Chris.

147
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:47,634
Miss March...

148
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:49,590
Kitty.

149
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,666
Yes, Miss-I mean...

150
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,064
Kitty...

151
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,514
Well, look... Kitty,...

152
00:12:57,995 --> 00:12:59,792
since I'm old enough
to be your father...

153
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:00,864
You're not so old.

154
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:02,990
You don't think so?

155
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,270
You're not a boy, you're just...

156
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:07,504
...mature.

157
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:10,506
I like mature people.

158
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:13,310
Well, what I wanted to say was...

159
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,749
you shouldn't be alone in the
street so late at night.

160
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:20,025
I was coming home from work.

161
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:21,753
You work this late?

162
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,674
What do you do?

163
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:27,583
Guess.

164
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,108
- You're an actress!
- Oh, you are clever!

165
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:37,309
Now that you know all about me,
tell me about yourself.

166
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,227
- What do you do?
- I?

167
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,232
- Well, you see...
- Don't tell me.

168
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:46,551
- You work in a bank?
- No.

169
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:50,111
Well let's see, Greenwich Village
is full of artists...

170
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,311
I meet you in Greenwich Village...

171
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,786
You must be an artist. Right?

172
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:55,904
Well, I...

173
00:13:56,915 --> 00:14:00,191
- Yes, yes, I paint.
- Of course, you're a painter.

174
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,708
I love paintings.

175
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:03,831
To think I took you for a cashier.

176
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:04,951
Well...

177
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,625
You know those art galleries
on Fifth Avenue?

178
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,864
The prices they charge!

179
00:14:08,955 --> 00:14:12,550
I saw one little picture
that cost 50,000 dollars.

180
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,034
They called it a...

181
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,947
- Seesan.
- Cezanne.

182
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:19,151
He was a great French painter.

183
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,393
I'd like to own that painting.

184
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,469
You would?

185
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:27,145
For 50,000 dollars?

186
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:30,632
Well, you can't put any price
on masterpieces like that.

187
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,630
They're worth... well...

188
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,230
Whatever you can afford to pay for them.

189
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:38,800
You know what, I bet I saw some of
your pictures there and didn't know it.

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,986
Next time I'll look for your name.

191
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:42,224
No, no, no...

192
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,953
I don't sell my pictures.

193
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,467
Not in New York, you mean?

194
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:48,954
- No, I...
- I know.

195
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:52,632
I bet you sell your pictures in Europe,
France or some place like that.

196
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:55,225
You can tell I don't know
much about painting.

197
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:58,100
I bet you get as much for
your pictures in France

198
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:00,625
as those Frenchmen get right
here in New York.

199
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,072
You're never appreciated
in your own country.

200
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,791
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

201
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:09,872
But you know, when I paint
I don't think of money.

202
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:13,069
- I just paint for fun.
- Fun?

203
00:15:13,155 --> 00:15:15,430
Yes, I think it's the
most fun I know, painting.

204
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,911
I wish I had all the time to paint.

205
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,908
- But don't you have time?
- No, I... well... yes...

206
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:24,191
You see, I...

207
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:26,190
Well, you know...

208
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:29,351
Business takes a lot of time.

209
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,426
No wonder, when you get all that money.

210
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:34,151
What play are you acting in?

211
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,870
- It closed tonight.
- Which one?

212
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,428
The one I was in. What time is it?

213
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:47,794
- It's only ten past two.
- Only?

214
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:51,468
It's time for Kitty to be in bed.

215
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,546
So you won't forget me.

216
00:15:58,355 --> 00:15:59,424
Thank you.

217
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:03,354
- Can I see you again?
- Sure, sometime.

218
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:05,630
- Well, if you give me your telephone
number... - I haven't got a phone.

219
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,864
May I write you?

220
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:08,627
That's the address. Good night, Chris.

221
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,026
Kitty, who is Johnny?

222
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:14,148
Why do you ask that?

223
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:16,305
I just heard you ask the bartender.

224
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:20,352
Oh sure, he's just a fella I know,
he's Millie's boyfriend.

225
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:22,903
You know, the girl I live with?
Good night, Chris.

226
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:24,510
Good night, Kitty.

227
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:02,474
Christopher!

228
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:08,383
Christopher!

229
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,383
Yes, Adele.

230
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,793
- This is a pleasure! I didn't expect to
see you, Charlie! - But you asked me.

231
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:35,028
My wife...

232
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,185
Well, it's good to see you anyway.

233
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:41,266
That was a swell party last night,
wasn't it, Charlie?

234
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,869
Say, what time did we go home?

235
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,105
After midnight, wasn't it?

236
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:50,392
You know, I haven't been to bed yet.

237
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:51,351
You haven't?

238
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:53,471
I guess I might as well act as drunk
as I thought I was, eh Charlie?

239
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:54,624
No, no...

240
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:57,874
Oh, I've got to do the dishes for Adele.

241
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:00,628
- You don't mind, Charlie, do you?
- No, no, go right ahead.

242
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:11,151
Say, did you paint this?

243
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:14,871
Great Scott, no! That isn't painting,
that's mud.

244
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:17,145
- Done by a photographer.
- Who is it?

245
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:20,426
The late departed...

246
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,860
Oh... your wife's former husband.

247
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:27,743
Detective Sargeant Higgins,
Homer Higgins.

248
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:30,710
Say, that's a real medal, isn't it?

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,868
Yeah, Adele got it.

250
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:36,587
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:39,305
After he was drowned in the East River.

252
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:42,713
Jumped in to save a woman.

253
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,472
Neither body was found.

254
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,309
Oh... too bad.

255
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:49,994
Yeah, too bad.

256
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:01,266
- Oh, thank you, Charlie.
- Not at all.

257
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,785
How long have you been married, Chris?

258
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:08,474
Five years...

259
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:10,950
Well...

260
00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:15,110
She didn't want to spend his
insurance money, so she

261
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,470
rented out a spare room.

262
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:20,307
24 dollars a week.

263
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:23,353
Well, I was trying to save money to
buy paints,

264
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:24,504
so I moved in.

265
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:27,273
Oh, she was sweet...

266
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,065
Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.

267
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,628
And...

268
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:36,591
Well, you know how these things go.

269
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:38,629
Smoke?

270
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:40,634
Oh...

271
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,827
guess I better not.

272
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:49,353
Where are your paintings, Chris?

273
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:51,346
They're out in the hall.

274
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:53,824
- Would you like to see what
I did today? - Yes, I'd like to.

275
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:11,745
Where did you find a flower like that?

276
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:19,005
You mean you see this
when you look at... that?

277
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,069
Well, yes... that is, I sort of feel it.

278
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,467
You see, when I look at that
flower, I see someone...

279
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:29,585
Is there anything private in this house?

280
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,833
I'm sorry, Adele.

281
00:20:34,595 --> 00:20:36,267
We better get out of here.

282
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:44,754
All right, Adele...

283
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:33,509
Can't you get those lazy legs
off that couch, maybe?

284
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:35,023
Come here.

285
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,551
Can't you do any better than that?

286
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:41,746
That's all you think about,
Lazy Legs, hmm?

287
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:44,065
What else is there to think about...

288
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:52,107
If you want more heat
in this apartment, Miss...

289
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:54,914
- you'll have to call a janitor.
- You idiot.

290
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,993
How come you're holding out on me, Baby?

291
00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:59,663
Oh, stop talking about Saturday night!

292
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,504
I'm not talking about Saturday night...
I'm talking about this.

293
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:08,429
It sounds like a schoolboy
trying to make a date.

294
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,471
You must be robbing the cradle.

295
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,707
- What's so funny?
- You are.

296
00:22:12,795 --> 00:22:14,626
He's old enough to be my father.

297
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:18,794
That's the old fellow who came
to my rescue Saturday night... My hero!

298
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,510
No kidding!

299
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:24,272
See? You were too tight
to remember anything.

300
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:26,630
If I hadn't told the cop to go in the
wrong direction he'd have picked you up.

301
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:29,111
This the old fellow who butted in?

302
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:30,828
The painter?

303
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:34,506
He's rich and famous and
very sweet too, Johnny.

304
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:36,866
He doesn't pull any
rough stuff like you.

305
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:39,545
Why, I had a chance
to clean up in a crap game.

306
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:41,626
All I needed was 50 bucks...

307
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:43,900
And what did you show up with?
15, for cat's sake.

308
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:46,308
That's all I had.

309
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:48,955
Besides, you kept me waiting
two hours in the rain.

310
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:52,433
- And then you gave me a dirty look.
- I didn't give you a dirty look.

311
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:57,000
Any girl who waits 2 hours in the rain
for a guy is gonna give him a dirty look

312
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:02,833
Trouble with you, baby, is
you have no imagination.

313
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:07,267
- What do you expect me to do?
- I expect you to use your brains.

314
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:11,104
For cat's sake this chump
is crazy about you!

315
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:14,312
This is a set-up. He's in
the big money, isn't he?

316
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:16,625
You said 50,000 a picture, didn't you?

317
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:20,511
And here I am, knocking my brains out,
trying to raise a little capital...

318
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:22,347
and this is right in your lap.

319
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:24,945
You don't have to call what's-his-name

320
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:26,787
and get a measly 50.

321
00:23:26,995 --> 00:23:28,872
This bird is goofy about you!

322
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,066
Write him, date him up.

323
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:34,192
I can't take money
off an old man like that!

324
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:39,000
For cat's sake, get big-hearted

325
00:23:39,075 --> 00:23:41,748
and smart, Lazy Legs!

326
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:44,827
Why, I see fellas in the big dough
without half my brains...

327
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,827
but ability isn't enough!

328
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:49,588
You gotta have money to make money.
Capital!

329
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:51,393
But the boys at the Acme Garage would

330
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:53,830
cut me in on a half-interest if I
can put up the money.

331
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:56,634
- How much do they want?
- Three or four thousand.

332
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:58,110
Yipe!

333
00:23:58,195 --> 00:23:59,708
For cat's sake, I'm not talking
about chicken feed!

334
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,434
Use your imagination.

335
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:05,390
You get an interest
in a business like that...

336
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:07,750
and it's a cinch to squeeze out
your partners.

337
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:10,107
Then you're on easy street.

338
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:12,470
Jeepers, the pipe dreams you have!

339
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:14,628
Now what about the letter?

340
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,474
Oh, I can get 50 or a hundred perhaps,
but I can't get

341
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:20,388
the kind of money you're talking about,
I wouldn't know how.

342
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:23,623
Johnny!

343
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,868
- Johnny, where are you going?
- Where I won't be wasting my time.

344
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:29,031
Johnny, Johnny...

345
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,768
I don't know why I'm so crazy about you.

346
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,647
Oh, yes you do...

347
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:41,213
Now what about my proposition?

348
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:45,131
You don't have to tap the old
chump for much...

349
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:46,443
not at first.

350
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,048
We'll get you a decent apartment.

351
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:50,933
Someplace where I'll like to come and
see you, not a dump like this.

352
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:53,248
Well, Lazy Legs?

353
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:58,093
- May I come in to my own apartment?
- Hello, Funny Face.

354
00:24:58,615 --> 00:25:00,094
Why don't you just move in, Johnny?

355
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,927
- Then I can move out.
- Now, Millie...

356
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:05,246
- Stop picking on my fiancé.
- How do you spell that word?

357
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:07,371
With an "F", like in "Funny Face".

358
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,573
She pays half the rent, doesn't she?

359
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:11,811
That was the general idea, Big Shot,
when we signed the lease.

360
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,803
I don't mind if you want
this place to yourself.

361
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:16,443
To you, Baby.

362
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:24,964
- What's he mean by that?
- Oh, nothing. You know Johnny.

363
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,403
Yeah, I know Johnny all right.

364
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:29,166
Has he bought you
that engagement ring yet?

365
00:25:29,415 --> 00:25:31,565
You seem to worry
more about it than I do.

366
00:25:39,735 --> 00:25:41,566
The new 45-dollar model.

367
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:44,493
Only Roger let me have it for 18.
He said he made a profit at that.

368
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:47,084
I thought you said you were
modeling girdles for the catalog?

369
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,569
I have been.

370
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,127
I ache like a dog!

371
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:55,288
If corsets ever come back,
I swear I'll quit modeling.

372
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:00,853
Why don't you go back to work?

373
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:03,973
With that figure, if you
weren't so darn lazy...

374
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:07,844
Who do you think you are,
my guardian angel?

375
00:26:08,255 --> 00:26:11,292
Not me, honey. I lost those
wings a long time ago.

376
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:13,129
That's what I thought.

377
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,846
No wonder you got fired,
you're so darn snippy.

378
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:17,967
You never could get to work on time

379
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:20,046
after you met that Johnny.

380
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:22,889
Honey, what's happened to you?

381
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:25,685
Don't you wish it could happen to you!

382
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:27,931
I'm in love, crazy in love!

383
00:26:28,015 --> 00:26:30,131
With a man who pushes you around
the way I wouldn't push a cat around.

384
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,250
You leave Johnny out of this!

385
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:33,087
With your looks and figure
you could get any man you want.

386
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:36,292
Sure, but there's only one I want.

387
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:38,094
Yeah, and he's making
a tramp out of you.

388
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:40,370
You wouldn't know love if it
hit you in the face!

389
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:42,810
If that's where it hits you,
you ought to know!

390
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:32,565
That robin sings just like I feel.

391
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:36,489
Look, there's a pair of them up there,
they're building their nest.

392
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:44,653
Say, where'd you learn that?

393
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:48,128
When I was a kid.

394
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:50,845
But I haven't done that in 40 years.

395
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:53,373
I feel like a kid myself today.

396
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,167
Sold any pictures lately?

397
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:00,244
No.

398
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,366
Why don't you paint my picture?

399
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:03,974
I'd like to.

400
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:06,406
Could I bring my easel
to your apartment?

401
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:08,531
I'm afraid my girlfriend
wouldn't like that.

402
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,533
How long does it take you
to paint a picture?

403
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:14,174
Sometimes a day, sometimes a year.

404
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:16,530
You can't tell, it has to grow.

405
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,686
I never knew paint could grow!

406
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:20,009
Feeling grows.

407
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,491
You know,
that's the important thing... feeling.

408
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:25,692
Now you take me, nobody ever
taught me how to draw,

409
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:28,853
so I just put a line around what
I feel when I look at things.

410
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:30,364
Yeah, I see.

411
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:31,570
It's like...

412
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:34,688
it's like falling in love, I guess.

413
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:37,574
You know...

414
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:41,245
First you see someone, and
then it keeps growing...

415
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:43,891
until you can't think of anyone else.

416
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,249
That's interesting.

417
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:48,091
The way I look at things,
that's all art is.

418
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:52,006
Every painting, if it's
any good, is a love affair.

419
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:55,569
I never heard anyone
talk like that before.

420
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,490
Well...

421
00:28:58,095 --> 00:29:00,689
...there aren't many people
you can talk to this way.

422
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:03,213
So you keep it to yourself.

423
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:06,124
You walk around
with everything bottled up.

424
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:07,648
Yeah, that's right.

425
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,491
That's the way it is with me too.

426
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:13,685
I'm sort of keeping things
bottled up too, Chris.

427
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:17,848
The truth is, I'm in a jam.

428
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,372
- You, Kitty?
- You probably guessed it...

429
00:29:20,455 --> 00:29:21,524
I'm broke.

430
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:24,687
Even this dress belongs to Millie,
I can't pay my rent.

431
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:28,852
- How much is it?
- Oh, forget it.

432
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,291
I shouldn't have told you.

433
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,043
- It'll spoil your day.
- Oh, but Kitty...

434
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:37,124
I'll get out of it somehow.

435
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:39,126
I couldn't take anything
from you, Chris.

436
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:42,208
- Well, no... yes... I mean...
- No, no, I couldn't.

437
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,534
I've never taken money from a man
and I'm not going to now.

438
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:47,811
And I'm not going
to spoil our friendship.

439
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:49,363
Oh, but Kitty...

440
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:50,974
I couldn't pay you back.

441
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:55,494
Chris!

442
00:29:56,215 --> 00:29:57,773
Maybe I could pay you back.

443
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,527
If you put up the money
for a studio apartment,

444
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:03,574
then I'd have a place to live, and you
could paint there. Don't you see?

445
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:06,492
You could paint my portrait.

446
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,454
What's the matter?

447
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:15,046
Don't you want to paint my picture?

448
00:30:15,135 --> 00:30:17,251
- There's something I've got
to tell you, Kitty. - What?

449
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,766
I deceived you.

450
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:21,403
I lied.

451
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:25,887
I'm a married man, Kitty.

452
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:31,411
Why didn't you tell me, Chris?

453
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:35,533
You know I'm not the kind to run
around with a married man, don't you?

454
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:39,175
You know what you said
about meeting someone?

455
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,171
How you begin to like them, and...

456
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:44,246
and you can't think about anybody else?

457
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:47,851
You should have told me
you had a wife, Chris.

458
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:51,408
- Yes, but I'm not in love with her,
Kitty. - Well, you married her.

459
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:54,851
I was lonely,
I couldn't stand my loneliness.

460
00:30:56,695 --> 00:30:58,128
Poor Chris.

461
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:00,693
Then you're not angry with me?

462
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,131
Why, I suppose I ought to be,
but I'm not.

463
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:06,687
Not with you, Chris.

464
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:08,574
I'm going to let you help me.

465
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:11,249
- How much do you need?
- 500 dollars.

466
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:18,369
500...

467
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:04,970
I need 500 dollars.

468
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:07,565
I could pay it back 10 dollars a week.

469
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:09,453
That's all right, Mr. Cross.

470
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:11,447
But you'll have to have a co-signer.

471
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:13,885
- Thank you, no.
- Property owner.

472
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:16,724
- Property owner?
- Just a formality.

473
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,291
- Thank you very much.
- Anytime.

474
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,524
Well, write to that
old skin-flint Hogarth

475
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:28,412
to give you a raise.

476
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:31,009
You don't even make enough
money to buy me a radio.

477
00:32:31,095 --> 00:32:34,246
I have to run downstairs every
night to listen to the radio.

478
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:36,168
The way I have to scrimp and save...

479
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,485
and you wasting money on paints.

480
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:41,166
I'd like to know
what you'd do without me...

481
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:42,968
Poor dear Homer.

482
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:45,569
If only he had a grave where
I could put some flowers.

483
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:48,166
Why, you couldn't ask me to marry you!

484
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:51,486
I had to put the words into your mouth.
I'd have been better off a widow.

485
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:55,089
The only reason I put up with you
is because I'm married to you...

486
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:58,133
- I'm stuck.
- Yes, and I'm stuck too.

487
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,527
Have you been drinking?

488
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:02,488
No, I haven't.

489
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,247
Let me smell your breath.

490
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:10,287
Then what's the matter with you?
Why are you shouting at me?

491
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,445
You keep blaming me for not
buying you a radio.

492
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:15,208
You think I like running downstairs
every night to listen to the radio?

493
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:18,412
- Why don't you buy a radio? You have
money. - His insurance money?

494
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:20,447
Well, I don't want a radio,
you want it.

495
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:23,607
I'll never touch those bonds.
They're for my old age.

496
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,526
If Homer were alive I'd have a radio.

497
00:33:26,615 --> 00:33:29,129
He made a good salary.
He gave me a good home.

498
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,852
Well, you're living in the
same apartment, aren't you?

499
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,403
Yes... but it didn't smell of paint!

500
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:37,612
I can't sleep for the smell of paint.

501
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:39,686
And all your silly pictures
cluttering up the hall...

502
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:41,049
If you don't get rid of that trash...

503
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:43,330
I swear I'll give it to the junkman!

504
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:46,934
- Adele!
- I will.

505
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:49,368
I swear I will.

506
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,494
And the things you paint...

507
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:55,288
It was bad enough when you used to
copy picture postcards.

508
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:59,084
Well, Utrillo copies postcards,
and he's considered a great painter.

509
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:02,845
And now I suppose you're copying
Utrillo or whatever his name is?

510
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:05,804
And you're getting
crazier all the time... Oh, yes.

511
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:08,293
I saw what you're doing.

512
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,445
Girls... snakes...

513
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:13,210
Next thing you'll be painting
women without clothes!

514
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:15,172
I never saw a woman without any clothes.

515
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:17,246
I should hope not!

516
00:34:23,455 --> 00:34:26,446
The Happy Household Hour's
just coming on, dear.

517
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,728
I'll be right down, Dora.
Mr. Cross came home late.

518
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:35,130
Go ahead and eat...

519
00:34:35,855 --> 00:34:37,652
and then do the dishes.

520
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:39,814
"This is The Happy Household Hour...

521
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:42,300
brought to you at this time
by Happy Hour Bubble Suds.

522
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,927
No soap gives you more happiness,

523
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,811
more washings and more suds per package,

524
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:52,700
than Happy Hour Bubble Suds.

525
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,600
Ask your nearest grocer for the large
economy-size package today.

526
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:59,814
And now for the next episode of
'Hilda's Hope for Happiness'.

527
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:02,411
As you remember,
we left Hilda in the laundry...

528
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:03,848
...Bubble Suds...

529
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,130
...Hilda...

530
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:46,363
Christopher!

531
00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:59,008
Christopher!

532
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:06,288
What are you doing?

533
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,849
I was...
I was looking for the paper.

534
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:10,368
Are you blind?

535
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:13,975
No. Didn't you...
didn't you like the radio?

536
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:18,972
It went off right in the middle of
a program. I wouldn't have such a radio.

537
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:23,611
- Say, did you read this?
- Read what?

538
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,733
This murder in Queens.

539
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:28,565
A man killed his wife
with a window weight...

540
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:30,771
put her body in a trunk and
shipped it to California.

541
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,210
- It says here...
- I read the paper, thank you.

542
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:35,573
He didn't get away with it, did he?

543
00:36:35,655 --> 00:36:37,691
He'll go to the chair, as he should.

544
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:41,565
Yeah, a man hasn't got a chance
with these New York detectives.

545
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:44,244
Can't you put that paper down
and do the dishes?

546
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:02,844
Adele...

547
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:05,653
you didn't mean what you said

548
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:07,453
about giving my paintings away
to the junkman?

549
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:08,968
You'll find out...

550
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:19,330
Well, you won't have to.

551
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,970
A friend of mine is taking an apartment

552
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:24,410
in Greenwich Village,
I'll move everything there.

553
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,612
Well, if he's fool enough to
let you do it...

554
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:29,413
- Go ahead. The sooner the better.
- Yes.

555
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:37,290
Top floor. You'll get plenty of light.
Lots of privacy.

556
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:40,329
You heard of Tony Rivera,
the illustrator?

557
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:43,244
He had this apartment
on a three-year lease.

558
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:45,286
Couldn't work anywhere else.

559
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:48,245
This was his studio.

560
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:51,291
The sketches on the wall are Rivera's.

561
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,613
He'd do that with his models sometimes

562
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:55,731
when he was working on a magazine cover.

563
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,570
Some people would pay
a lot of money for those.

564
00:37:59,095 --> 00:38:00,813
Are you an artist, Miss March?

565
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,289
- Where's the bedroom?
- This way.

566
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:10,766
What's the rent, Mr. Jones?

567
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,370
150. There are some things that Rivera
left here stored in the basement.

568
00:38:14,455 --> 00:38:16,969
They go with the apartment if you care
to use them.

569
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:19,167
Here you are... the bedroom.

570
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:25,772
I don't like the wallpaper.

571
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:27,534
Will they change the paper?

572
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:30,251
I guess so, on a year's lease.

573
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:32,253
I'll pick it out myself.

574
00:39:22,895 --> 00:39:24,886
Well, don't break the bank!

575
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,088
Hello, Lazy Legs.

576
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:30,689
I thought I heard the doorbell.

577
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,687
I didn't hear anything.

578
00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:40,612
Say, is this all you've got?

579
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:44,125
I'm lucky I have that left, the way you
were throwing it around last night!

580
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:47,252
You even bought me a book, Honey.

581
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,525
You're supposed to be an actress,
aren't you?

582
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,644
Shakespeare, for Pete's sake!

583
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:01,727
Say, that's all I have left!

584
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:04,528
You know where to get more,
don't you, Lazy Legs?

585
00:40:05,775 --> 00:40:08,608
Told me he hadn't sold any pictures
for a long time...

586
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:12,045
And now I'm in hock for all this!

587
00:40:27,015 --> 00:40:28,164
Look, Kitty...

588
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:33,171
I need at least 1000 dollars.

589
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,730
- Ouch!
- Well, you've got him softened up...

590
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:38,169
Now, push him around a bit.

591
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:41,529
He seems to get scared
when I talk about money.

592
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:44,171
Listen Baby, you've got him
right where you want him.

593
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:46,405
He's on the hook and can't get off.

594
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,573
- He can walk out, can't he?
- He's got a wife, hasn't he?

595
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:52,284
Just drop a hint that his wife might
find out about this apartment...

596
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,013
and he'll shell out fast.

597
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:55,534
That's blackmail...

598
00:40:55,655 --> 00:40:58,772
It's only blackmail, Baby...

599
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:00,766
when you're dumb enough to get caught.

600
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:06,850
- Is that him?
- Told you I heard the doorbell.

601
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,764
For cat's sake!... Get rid of him.

602
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:42,934
Why...

603
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:45,374
Don't you answer doorbells?

604
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:47,923
- I thought you were mad at me.
- Peace offering...

605
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:49,892
- Scotch!
- Thanks, Honey.

606
00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:52,645
I didn't think you were out,
it's only 10 past 12.

607
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:54,966
I rang and rang downstairs
and then I found the door was open.

608
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,172
Well, well, well.

609
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,453
You're doing all right
for a working girl.

610
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:04,253
Now don't start that again!

611
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:12,126
Don't tell me he's under the sofa, too!

612
00:42:12,215 --> 00:42:13,330
No, Bright Eyes.

613
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:16,928
You can come out, Johnny.

614
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:19,766
All you have to do is call, Funny Face.

615
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:25,365
You must have made a killing in
Wall Street, Mr. Prince...

616
00:42:25,535 --> 00:42:26,729
Could be.

617
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:30,129
The last time I saw Johnny he was
talking about going to Hollywood.

618
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,853
I might try it yet.

619
00:42:31,935 --> 00:42:35,405
I read in a movie magazine about a fella
who landed in Hollywood stone broke...

620
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:38,083
and cleaned up a million!
No experience, either.

621
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:41,207
All he had was looks, and he
worked in a drugstore.

622
00:42:41,815 --> 00:42:43,726
If he worked, Johnny,
he didn't look like you.

623
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,689
- Will you two stop fighting?
- I'm not fighting, Baby.

624
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,527
She just doesn't know my speed.

625
00:42:48,615 --> 00:42:49,934
Why, I hear of movie actors

626
00:42:50,015 --> 00:42:51,846
getting 5000... 10,000 a week!

627
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,254
For what?

628
00:42:53,335 --> 00:42:55,803
For acting tough, for pushing
girls in the face.

629
00:42:55,895 --> 00:42:57,169
What do they do I can't do?

630
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,774
You're so clever, why don't you do it?

631
00:43:00,255 --> 00:43:02,644
I might, Funny Face, I might!

632
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:11,845
Chris!

633
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:13,926
I brought over some of my things, Kitty.

634
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:16,253
I'll bring some more tomorrow...

635
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:18,773
The rest on Saturday.

636
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:24,766
- Oh... You have company.
- It's just Millie and Johnny.

637
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:26,574
- John...?
- You know, Millie's boyfriend.

638
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:27,974
Come on... I want you to meet them.

639
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:31,485
Millie, this is a friend of mine,
Mr. Cross, Miss Ray.

640
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,135
- How do you do, Miss Ray?
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Cross.

641
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:37,525
- And... Johnny Prince.
- Glad to know you, Mr. Cross.

642
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:40,569
How do you do?

643
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:43,851
Seems to me I've seen you
before somewhere...

644
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:46,643
Could be... could be, Mr. Cross.

645
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:47,725
Yes, I...

646
00:43:48,815 --> 00:43:52,046
I just don't seem to remember...
Maybe I'm mistaken.

647
00:43:52,535 --> 00:43:53,411
Could be.

648
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:57,371
- Well, I have to run along, kid.
- I'll go with you, sweetheart.

649
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:00,014
Oh, don't bother, Johnny.

650
00:44:00,135 --> 00:44:02,490
I wouldn't think of letting
you go alone... Darling!

651
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,966
You might get run over by a streetcar.

652
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:11,643
Goodbye, Mr. Cross. Nice to see you.

653
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:15,204
- Thanks for the scotch, Millie.
- That's okay... Bye!

654
00:44:15,895 --> 00:44:18,125
- So long, Kitty!
- So long, Johnny!

655
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:24,213
Now what's the matter, Chris?

656
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:27,974
I don't think I like that young man
she's in love with.

657
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:29,728
Oh, Johnny's all right...

658
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:32,329
Oh, I know he is, or he wouldn't
be a friend, but...

659
00:44:33,095 --> 00:44:36,087
- There's something about him that...
- She's crazy about him!

660
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,606
Would you... Would you like
to see my pictures?

661
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:44,330
Not yet. Come sit down, Chris.

662
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:49,089
You happy?

663
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:52,812
- For the first time in my life.
- Very happy?

664
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:55,807
I think of you all the time.

665
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,325
All I want is to see you, be near you.

666
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:03,731
I know I haven't any right
to ask you this, but...

667
00:45:03,815 --> 00:45:05,931
Have you ever...?

668
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:10,326
Well... there must have been
other men who...

669
00:45:14,135 --> 00:45:15,488
Just one, Chris.

670
00:45:16,735 --> 00:45:18,453
You still see him?

671
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,490
I've forgotten him.

672
00:45:24,215 --> 00:45:26,649
Look, Kitty... if I were single...

673
00:45:27,215 --> 00:45:30,048
- if I had no wife...
- But you have a wife!

674
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:32,091
Yes I know, but if she'd...

675
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:36,732
Well... if something would happen
that would make me free...

676
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,248
Would you marry me?

677
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,286
Oh, let's not talk about it now, dear!

678
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,093
What I'm worried about is getting a job.

679
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:46,405
Living like this... it's expensive.

680
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,929
I don't like to ask you
for anything more

681
00:45:49,015 --> 00:45:52,530
because... well, you say you haven't
sold any pictures lately.

682
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:54,967
Yes, but... don't you have enough money?

683
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:57,410
You have no idea what a problem
money is for an actress, Chris.

684
00:45:57,495 --> 00:46:00,373
Talent doesn't count in the theatre.
Everything is pull!

685
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:01,854
Contacts, knowing the right people...

686
00:46:01,935 --> 00:46:04,051
You have to get an agent...
they charge plenty...

687
00:46:04,135 --> 00:46:07,411
- Wear smart clothes, be attractive.
- But Kitty, you're beautiful!

688
00:46:08,815 --> 00:46:12,410
Chris, your face doesn't mean a thing!

689
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:16,052
It's clothes, perfumes,
making the right impression.

690
00:46:16,455 --> 00:46:19,128
Why, an actress needs 1000 dollars
just to get a decent wardrobe.

691
00:46:19,535 --> 00:46:21,924
- 1000 dollars?
- At least.

692
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:25,803
Maybe I can borrow it from Millie.
Or her boyfriend... Johnny.

693
00:46:27,015 --> 00:46:28,846
He's got plenty of money.

694
00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:32,452
Oh... No, no, no, Kitty.
Not from Johnny.

695
00:46:33,495 --> 00:46:34,644
Why not?

696
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:38,005
I'll get you the money some way...

697
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,650
Chris, you're a darling!

698
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:44,404
I really believe you're in love with me.

699
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,487
I am, Kitty, I am!

700
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:52,413
Chris, you're a caveman!

701
00:46:52,695 --> 00:46:55,767
I like you to like me...
well... there's a limit.

702
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,208
Yes, I know...

703
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:02,405
I've got to go,
I'm supposed to be back...

704
00:47:02,895 --> 00:47:04,886
I'll come here tomorrow at noon, Kitty.

705
00:47:05,015 --> 00:47:08,485
I'll be waiting for you.
I'm sorry you have to go...

706
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:13,768
Bye-bye, Dear.

707
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,764
- Don't forget the money!
- I'll get it.

708
00:47:24,135 --> 00:47:26,171
- Bye-bye, Chris.
- Goodbye!

709
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:15,574
I don't get it.

710
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,172
The poor sap must be a hophead, seeing

711
00:48:18,255 --> 00:48:20,211
snakes on the "L"!

712
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:24,124
Imagine anyone paying
money for this stuff?

713
00:48:24,815 --> 00:48:28,091
Say, are you sure he's not a phony?

714
00:48:28,855 --> 00:48:31,210
He's too dumb to be a phony!

715
00:48:31,295 --> 00:48:34,492
- You're right there.
- Then how did he get all the money?

716
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:38,324
Why, if he had to work for a living,
he couldn't make 50 dollars a week.

717
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,965
You just don't know art.

718
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:43,814
Maybe not, but I'm
gonna find out about it.

719
00:48:44,175 --> 00:48:46,052
I kinda like this one.

720
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:48,526
But where would you find
flowers like that?

721
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:52,050
I wonder if I couldn't sell these!

722
00:48:52,135 --> 00:48:54,569
And what do I do when
he asks where they are?

723
00:48:54,655 --> 00:48:56,213
Say you put them in storage.

724
00:48:56,295 --> 00:48:57,614
You know, you got to protect him...

725
00:48:57,695 --> 00:48:59,413
You can't leave valuable
paintings lying around

726
00:48:59,495 --> 00:49:01,053
where somebody can pick them up.

727
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:03,774
You'd get in trouble.
Any gallery would know his work!

728
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:09,330
He tried to kiss me today...
and don't think I liked it!

729
00:49:09,735 --> 00:49:11,487
Oh, you've been kissed before.

730
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:14,655
Say... they're not even signed!

731
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,252
That doesn't matter, they'd know them.

732
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:18,973
Not where I take them, Baby!

733
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:22,650
Johnny... I can't stand to
have anyone touch me but you.

734
00:49:24,055 --> 00:49:26,205
I hate him
when he looks at me like that!

735
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:30,090
If he were mean or vicious or
if he bawled me out I'd like him better.

736
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:32,534
You don't love me,

737
00:49:32,855 --> 00:49:34,846
or you'd understand what I mean.

738
00:49:35,135 --> 00:49:36,727
- No?
- No.

739
00:49:48,575 --> 00:49:49,530
No?

740
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:52,490
Well... maybe.

741
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:00,932
Working late tonight, Mr. Cross?

742
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:03,609
I'm about through, Ben,
you can let me out in a minute.

743
00:50:03,695 --> 00:50:04,969
Yes, sir.

744
00:50:36,175 --> 00:50:37,813
I just caught you in time!

745
00:50:49,415 --> 00:50:51,975
Cash this for me, will you, Chris?
It's personal.

746
00:50:52,775 --> 00:50:55,608
Yes, yes... Yes, of course, JJ.

747
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:20,052
- Here you are, JJ.
- Thank you, Chris.

748
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:21,847
Good night.
Good night, JJ.

749
00:51:32,455 --> 00:51:33,854
- Hello, Nick.
- Hi.

750
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:46,403
What do you got?

751
00:51:48,175 --> 00:51:52,248
The fellow who paints those gets
50 grand for a single picture!

752
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:56,373
Hey! What's the matter with you, Nick?

753
00:51:57,335 --> 00:51:59,565
Where'd you pick them up...
over in Washington Square?

754
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:02,011
The Village long-hairs are
peddling junk like that...

755
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:03,574
for the price of the canvas.

756
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:05,725
These weren't painted by
any Village long-hair!

757
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:08,925
That's my pawnshop, isn't it?

758
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:12,172
And that snake is
strictly from the Bronx.

759
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:14,405
This fellow lives in Brooklyn.
He's famous!

760
00:52:14,495 --> 00:52:16,247
- Yeah, what's his name?
- Well, I...

761
00:52:16,695 --> 00:52:19,687
Nick, I've brought you stuff before
and you never asked for any name on it.

762
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:23,804
That was jewelry! Bring me some more
of that and we can do business, Johnny.

763
00:52:24,935 --> 00:52:27,688
Take this junk back to Washington Square
where you got it!

764
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:10,250
I can see you've got an eye for art!

765
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:13,366
That's one of my best.

766
00:53:13,575 --> 00:53:14,849
Take a look at these...

767
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:18,091
I didn't know you were a painter.

768
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:19,403
I'm not.

769
00:53:23,895 --> 00:53:25,726
- Are they any good?
- Well...

770
00:53:26,535 --> 00:53:27,854
they've got something.

771
00:53:29,455 --> 00:53:31,252
A certain peculiar...

772
00:53:32,135 --> 00:53:34,410
something. But no perspective.

773
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:37,045
- Is that important?
- I should say it is!

774
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:39,008
Look at my paintings.

775
00:53:39,775 --> 00:53:41,128
Where did you buy them?

776
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:42,933
I didn't buy them,
I want to sell them.

777
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:44,733
You want me to sell them on commission?

778
00:53:44,815 --> 00:53:47,727
- How much do you think they're worth?
- I always start everything at 25.

779
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,088
Then... you know, it's a hard
business selling pictures.

780
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:53,852
People don't buy art nowadays!

781
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:57,329
No appreciation, no taste,
no perception...

782
00:53:57,775 --> 00:53:59,003
No perspective, huh?

783
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:05,446
Let me have your name and address.

784
00:54:05,615 --> 00:54:08,083
I'll come back later... So long.

785
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:16,254
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hiya, Tiny.

786
00:54:19,535 --> 00:54:21,093
Where'd you get that?

787
00:54:22,695 --> 00:54:23,810
Off Nick.

788
00:54:24,055 --> 00:54:25,613
What about my ring?

789
00:54:26,615 --> 00:54:29,493
- You know how much a good diamond
costs? - I gave you 900 dollars.

790
00:54:30,295 --> 00:54:31,648
Will you pipe down?

791
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,492
You've been telling me what a dope
the old guy is...

792
00:54:42,775 --> 00:54:44,128
Maybe you're the dope.

793
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:48,410
He told you his paintings
are worth a lot of money...

794
00:54:48,895 --> 00:54:51,489
- Did you check up on his story?
- What's wrong with it?

795
00:54:52,175 --> 00:54:55,724
They're worth just 25 bucks apiece!
That's what's wrong with it.

796
00:54:56,015 --> 00:54:57,687
You're crazy!

797
00:54:59,215 --> 00:55:02,013
- If I weren't a gentleman...
- Well don't get sore!

798
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:04,245
Well then don't tell me I'm crazy!

799
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:12,452
I tell you the old boy's a phony.

800
00:55:13,175 --> 00:55:14,813
His money isn't phony, is it?

801
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,489
He could borrow dough, or
have it stashed away...

802
00:55:17,735 --> 00:55:19,771
- Or even steal it.
- Chris steal?

803
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:21,891
Jeepers, Johnny, he's not the type.

804
00:55:21,975 --> 00:55:23,488
He wouldn't have nerve enough to steal!

805
00:55:23,575 --> 00:55:25,167
Well he didn't get it from his pictures.

806
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,007
He may be dumb, but not about art.

807
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:28,700
The day he took me to the museum he
explained to me how everything was done.

808
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,325
You should have heard him. People stood
around and listened.

809
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:35,410
- What museum?
- The Metropolitan.

810
00:55:35,655 --> 00:55:38,647
Yipe! They've got pictures there
worth a million bucks.

811
00:55:44,135 --> 00:55:45,124
Where you going?

812
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:53,011
I'm going to make a money
out of you, Lazy Legs.

813
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:55,086
You can't take his pictures
to the museum!

814
00:55:55,175 --> 00:55:56,654
Who says I can't?

815
00:56:11,495 --> 00:56:13,133
You know who bought them?

816
00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:16,366
Janeway. Damon Janeway!

817
00:56:17,135 --> 00:56:19,410
- Don't you know who Mr. Janeway is?
- No.

818
00:56:19,495 --> 00:56:20,723
He's an art critic!

819
00:56:21,495 --> 00:56:24,134
The best authority in New York
on Modern Art.

820
00:56:24,775 --> 00:56:26,925
He took one look and bought them both.

821
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:29,131
I couldn't even give him my pictures.

822
00:56:29,215 --> 00:56:30,284
Not for nothing!

823
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:32,173
He wants to get hold of you.

824
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,849
He told me to telephone him.
You wait here, eh?

825
00:56:34,935 --> 00:56:35,970
No, no...

826
00:56:51,415 --> 00:56:52,484
Sorry...

827
00:56:56,255 --> 00:56:58,130
For cat's sake, what's so funny?

828
00:56:58,535 --> 00:57:00,173
You are, Smarty-Pants!

829
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:03,449
You're the Mr. Fix-It who was gonna
make a monkey

830
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:04,888
out of poor dopey little Kitty...

831
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:09,054
So you gave away two pictures
for a couple of dimes...

832
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:11,808
- and now you can't collect the dimes.
- Oh dry up!

833
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:15,969
- Jeepers!
- Now what?

834
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:18,330
- What am I gonna tell Chris?
- He won't find out.

835
00:57:18,575 --> 00:57:20,770
The heck he won't!
That Janeway's a crític...

836
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,208
he writes for the newspaper.

837
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:24,809
Golly, you got us in a spot.
I told you not to do it!

838
00:57:25,295 --> 00:57:26,444
You're just nervous!

839
00:57:26,535 --> 00:57:28,685
The old guy that sold them
doesn't know me from Adam.

840
00:57:28,775 --> 00:57:30,652
Give me that drink, I can use it.

841
00:57:35,015 --> 00:57:37,973
- Chris?
- No, he's got a key.

842
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:41,806
Well go ahead, see who it is.
Hurry up!

843
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,289
I beg your pardon, but...

844
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,844
we're looking for a man,
and I'm afraid we don't know his name.

845
00:57:57,935 --> 00:57:59,846
And I'm afraid I can't help you.

846
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,129
I'm sorry...

847
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:04,330
Look!

848
00:58:08,335 --> 00:58:09,768
There!

849
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:13,684
These are his.

850
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,648
Oh, there he is!

851
00:58:16,975 --> 00:58:19,205
Why did you run away from me like that?

852
00:58:20,535 --> 00:58:23,652
Here, 50 dollars less 20 percent.

853
00:58:23,735 --> 00:58:25,407
I don't know what you're talking about!

854
00:58:25,495 --> 00:58:26,814
But the pictures you brought me!

855
00:58:26,895 --> 00:58:29,614
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves:
My name is Janeway.

856
00:58:29,695 --> 00:58:31,686
- This is Mr. Dellarowe.
- How do you do?

857
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:32,890
What is it you want?

858
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:35,205
We'd like to find out
who painted the pictures.

859
00:58:35,815 --> 00:58:37,771
- You don't know?
- Of course they don't know!

860
00:58:38,535 --> 00:58:40,173
That's what we're here for.

861
00:58:40,335 --> 00:58:42,100
Look, if you're a friend of the painter,

862
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:43,848
you'll put Mr. Dellarowe
in touch with him.

863
00:58:43,935 --> 00:58:46,574
Why'd you buy those pictures if you
didn't know who painted them?

864
00:58:47,135 --> 00:58:49,171
- Because they're good.
- Who painted them?

865
00:58:58,295 --> 00:58:59,694
No, Johnny, no!

866
00:59:00,215 --> 00:59:02,490
Oh don't be so modest, Miss March.

867
00:59:02,575 --> 00:59:04,452
Now you see? You got me in bad.

868
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:06,332
She made me promise not to tell.

869
00:59:06,535 --> 00:59:08,412
That's why I made out
like I didn't know.

870
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:13,290
She's funny about her painting.

871
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:16,845
Never lets anyone see it. Doesn't
even put her name on her pictures!

872
00:59:17,415 --> 00:59:18,609
So I observed.

873
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:20,526
You're an extraordinary artist,
Miss March.

874
00:59:20,615 --> 00:59:22,128
- Oh, no.
- See?

875
00:59:22,295 --> 00:59:24,286
She can't stand for anybody
to talk about her.

876
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:26,605
She got the idea her pictures
weren't any good.

877
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,413
That's why I took those two to you...

878
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:31,567
to give her confidence...
I knew they were good.

879
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:33,728
Now I'll take that money.

880
00:59:34,055 --> 00:59:36,330
I never would have guessed
it was a woman.

881
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:39,243
Nor I... You're work is
very strong, Miss March.

882
00:59:39,335 --> 00:59:41,690
- May we see some more of it?
- Sure... go ahead!

883
00:59:41,775 --> 00:59:43,970
- Look in her studio.
- Thank you.

884
00:59:49,935 --> 00:59:52,324
You're crazy to try a thing like this!

885
00:59:52,415 --> 00:59:54,485
For cat's sake,
I thought they were cops!

886
00:59:54,575 --> 00:59:56,691
I know what I'm doing...
they don't know from nothing.

887
00:59:56,775 --> 00:59:58,174
I can't fool that crític!

888
00:59:58,255 --> 01:00:00,371
You always wanted to be an actress...
Now's your chance.

889
01:00:00,735 --> 01:00:03,488
You've been around the old boy
long enough to pick up his lingo...

890
01:00:03,615 --> 01:00:06,652
Feed Janeway some of that... I'll get
him in here alone with you.

891
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:07,969
No, no... wait!

892
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,600
How long has she been painting?

893
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:16,480
Ever since she was a kid, Mr. Janeway.

894
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,680
- Never went to art school, did she?
- No, she just picked it up...

895
01:00:20,695 --> 01:00:22,100
I guess I'm the only one who's

896
01:00:22,175 --> 01:00:23,600
been encouraging her, kind of...

897
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:27,400
Helping her along... as a friend...
You know, just a friend.

898
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:30,600
- I didn't get your name.
- Prince.

899
01:00:33,215 --> 01:00:36,968
Say Mr. Janeway... she's kind of upset.

900
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,300
Maybe you'd go in and talk to her?

901
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,300
Be glad to.

902
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,768
Well, Mr. Dellarowe?

903
01:00:53,135 --> 01:00:56,300
I wonder if Miss March would
let me have all of these?

904
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,700
Well that depends...

905
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:01,600
What's in it for her?

906
01:01:01,735 --> 01:01:04,800
Prices will have to be built up,
Mr. Prince, but...

907
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:17,432
I can usually tell whether a canvas

908
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:19,506
has been painted by a man or woman...

909
01:01:19,995 --> 01:01:22,031
But you fooled me completely,
Miss March.

910
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,709
Your work is not only original,
but has a masculine force.

911
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,300
How long does it take you
to paint a picture?

912
01:01:30,555 --> 01:01:34,309
Sometimes a day... sometimes a year.

913
01:01:35,075 --> 01:01:37,543
- You can't tell, it has to grow.
- Of course.

914
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:40,066
It's a matter of feeling, you know

915
01:01:40,435 --> 01:01:43,268
how feeling grows? It's like...

916
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,991
Like falling in love, I guess.

917
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,513
That's a very good description.

918
01:01:50,595 --> 01:01:54,224
The way I look at it... Every painting,
if it's any good, is...

919
01:01:55,035 --> 01:01:56,673
a love affair.

920
01:01:57,395 --> 01:01:59,192
- May I quote that?
- Oh, no, no...

921
01:01:59,275 --> 01:02:00,469
Please don't write about me.

922
01:02:00,835 --> 01:02:02,826
I can see you're going to be
a very hard case.

923
01:02:03,835 --> 01:02:05,826
Why don't you have confidence
in your work?

924
01:02:06,715 --> 01:02:08,387
Because I can't draw.

925
01:02:08,635 --> 01:02:09,829
You do all right.

926
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:11,986
I just put a line around what I feel

927
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:13,554
when I look at things.

928
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:17,909
You're a very stimulating
person to talk to.

929
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,263
How are you two getting along?

930
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:22,749
I think I'm breaking the ice.

931
01:02:22,835 --> 01:02:24,393
Kitty, Mr. Dellarowe wants to

932
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:27,626
handle all your work exclusively...
Is it all right?

933
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:29,872
As a friend I'd advise it.

934
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:31,593
Could you come
to the galleries tomorrow?

935
01:02:31,675 --> 01:02:34,314
- What time?
- Any time that's convenient.

936
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:36,554
How about twelve o'clock?

937
01:02:36,635 --> 01:02:38,432
And then lunch afterward with me.

938
01:02:38,515 --> 01:02:40,904
Well, I...

939
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:42,909
She'll be there.

940
01:02:44,075 --> 01:02:46,908
I'm glad you're around, Mr. Prince,
to make up her mind for her.

941
01:02:48,115 --> 01:02:49,833
I can see you're tired, Miss March.

942
01:02:49,915 --> 01:02:51,314
This has been enough for one evening.

943
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:53,353
We'd better go. Until tomorrow?

944
01:02:53,435 --> 01:02:55,505
Thanks, Mr. Janeway... so long.

945
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:57,390
Good evening.

946
01:02:57,635 --> 01:02:59,751
- Good night, Mr. Dellarowe.
- Good night.

947
01:03:06,035 --> 01:03:07,388
- Good night.
- Good night.

948
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:14,904
Lazy Legs...

949
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:18,994
I don't know what you told Janeway

950
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:20,588
but you've got him eating
right out of your hand.

951
01:03:20,675 --> 01:03:22,393
It won't stop with lunch...

952
01:03:22,475 --> 01:03:24,864
- Well, what's the difference?
- If you mean...

953
01:03:24,955 --> 01:03:26,946
Oh, stop acting like a green kid.

954
01:03:29,235 --> 01:03:32,272
Let him talk about what he wants to
talk about, and he won't talk about art.

955
01:03:32,715 --> 01:03:35,070
If I had any sense I'd walk out on you!

956
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,588
You haven't got any sense.

957
01:03:55,195 --> 01:03:57,663
Right here... just like
you'd sign a letter.

958
01:03:58,515 --> 01:03:59,948
Come on!

959
01:04:01,555 --> 01:04:03,466
- Katherine March.
- Kitty?

960
01:04:04,035 --> 01:04:06,151
For cat's sake!... Put that one back.

961
01:04:07,195 --> 01:04:08,264
Kitty?

962
01:04:11,155 --> 01:04:13,953
- Chris! - Oh, Kitty,
I happened to be in the neigh...

963
01:04:16,755 --> 01:04:19,827
Hello, Mr. Cross, I just dropped in.

964
01:04:19,915 --> 01:04:21,746
I thought Millie was here.

965
01:04:22,475 --> 01:04:24,545
Say, I hope you don't mind me
looking at your picture?

966
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:27,825
Oh no, not at all, Mr. Prince.

967
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:30,549
Fine work, that's remarkable painting.

968
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:33,471
You have a little trouble with
perspective, don't you?

969
01:04:33,675 --> 01:04:36,872
Yes, that's one thing I could
never master: Perspective.

970
01:04:38,155 --> 01:04:40,430
Well, I guess I'll have to run along.

971
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:42,034
So long, Mr. Cross.

972
01:04:42,195 --> 01:04:44,345
If Millie drops in, tell her
I'll be at Tiny's place.

973
01:04:44,435 --> 01:04:46,505
Don't bother, I'll let myself out.

974
01:04:54,835 --> 01:04:56,473
Has he been here long?

975
01:04:56,715 --> 01:04:58,068
No, why?

976
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:01,594
- I don't like him. - Johnny's all right
He's a nice fellow, Chris. Really he is.

977
01:05:01,675 --> 01:05:03,711
I don't know why you don't like him.

978
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:06,632
Well... was he the one?

979
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:08,709
One what?

980
01:05:09,115 --> 01:05:10,343
Well you said there was one man...

981
01:05:10,435 --> 01:05:12,073
Oh for heaven's sake, won't you
ever forget that?

982
01:05:12,155 --> 01:05:13,304
- Was he?
- No!

983
01:05:13,395 --> 01:05:14,623
- Kitty...
- Go ahead and paint if you want to...

984
01:05:14,715 --> 01:05:16,706
I'm not going to stick around if
you're going to torment me!

985
01:05:53,355 --> 01:05:54,470
Kitty...

986
01:05:56,355 --> 01:05:57,708
Oh, Kitty...

987
01:05:57,915 --> 01:06:00,145
Oh, leave me alone,
I'm going out for dinner!

988
01:06:04,755 --> 01:06:06,154
Kitty, don't be angry.

989
01:06:06,235 --> 01:06:08,795
Why do you come here if you want to
quarrel? I didn't ask you to come here!

990
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,786
Oh, please Kitty.

991
01:06:11,075 --> 01:06:12,554
Oh, for Pete's sake!

992
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:15,549
- Go and paint!
- I can't.

993
01:06:15,835 --> 01:06:18,224
I can't do a thing when
you're angry with me.

994
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,629
Do you want me to go?

995
01:06:23,515 --> 01:06:25,153
I want you to stay here and paint!

996
01:06:35,475 --> 01:06:37,909
Chris... I'm sorry, Chris, but

997
01:06:38,235 --> 01:06:40,908
why do you torment me about something
that's over and done with?

998
01:06:41,395 --> 01:06:42,623
Well, because I...

999
01:06:44,955 --> 01:06:47,310
- Would you marry me?
- You can't.

1000
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:50,311
- Well, something might happen.
- What?

1001
01:06:50,395 --> 01:06:52,670
You better not let your wife
hear you talking like that.

1002
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:56,189
Of course I'd marry you if
you were free, but...

1003
01:06:56,275 --> 01:06:59,347
You're not, so... Let's not talk
about it. Now you go on and paint.

1004
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:00,868
Could I paint you?

1005
01:07:03,275 --> 01:07:05,789
Well, I was going
to do this myself, but...

1006
01:07:09,195 --> 01:07:10,628
Paint me, Chris.

1007
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,946
There'll be masterpieces.

1008
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:10,108
Hello, Adele.

1009
01:08:10,395 --> 01:08:12,670
I dropped over to the butcher shop
like you told me to.

1010
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:15,231
They got a nice piece of liver...

1011
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:22,593
How long have you known Katherine March?

1012
01:08:23,315 --> 01:08:24,714
Answer me!

1013
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:31,992
- I don't know what you're talking
about. - How long have you known her?

1014
01:08:32,955 --> 01:08:35,515
Well now, don't get excited,
let me help you off with your coat.

1015
01:08:35,595 --> 01:08:38,189
You're the one who's excited... Look
at you! And keep away with that knife.

1016
01:08:39,035 --> 01:08:40,388
You want to cut my throat?

1017
01:08:44,355 --> 01:08:45,754
How long have you known her?

1018
01:08:47,435 --> 01:08:49,585
- I don't know what you're talking about
- Don't lie to me!

1019
01:08:50,315 --> 01:08:52,306
You've been copying her work for years!

1020
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:54,386
Pretending you painted those pictures
out of your own head and all the time...

1021
01:08:54,475 --> 01:08:56,466
you were just copying the work
of a real artist.

1022
01:08:56,555 --> 01:08:58,830
I'll bet you're at Dellarowe's
every day making notes!

1023
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,626
- Where?
- You know where.

1024
01:09:01,715 --> 01:09:03,785
Dellarowe's Art Gallery in 57th Street.

1025
01:09:04,275 --> 01:09:06,630
They've got a window full of
paintings by Katherine March.

1026
01:09:07,755 --> 01:09:08,870
You're talking crazy!

1027
01:09:08,955 --> 01:09:12,425
She gets 500 dollars for a single
picture. She's a genius!

1028
01:09:13,035 --> 01:09:14,832
No wonder I used to think sometimes

1029
01:09:14,915 --> 01:09:17,588
there was something in your work...
Now I know why!

1030
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,747
If you ever do any more
painting around here

1031
01:09:20,835 --> 01:09:22,314
I swear I'll write that woman a letter

1032
01:09:22,395 --> 01:09:24,955
telling her you're stealing her ideas!

1033
01:09:25,835 --> 01:09:26,824
You're a thief!

1034
01:09:28,275 --> 01:09:31,584
Hogarth had better watch out... Or next
thing you'll be stealing his money!

1035
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,228
Not that one, Honey.

1036
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:42,751
Dellarowe's asking for more pictures...

1037
01:09:42,995 --> 01:09:44,667
Chris just finished it, he'll miss it.

1038
01:09:45,275 --> 01:09:47,391
Janeway says the new pictures are...

1039
01:09:48,195 --> 01:09:49,469
the best things you've done!

1040
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:55,030
Wasn't I right about Janeway,
Lazy Legs?

1041
01:09:55,115 --> 01:09:56,753
Yeah, but he gets on my nerves.

1042
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,150
I been out to dinner with him
three times this week

1043
01:09:59,235 --> 01:10:00,987
and now he's talking about breakfast!

1044
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:03,906
He's getting that look in his eye...

1045
01:10:03,995 --> 01:10:05,986
All you gotta do is keep it there!

1046
01:10:06,075 --> 01:10:08,225
It's all very well for you to say...

1047
01:10:08,315 --> 01:10:10,306
but what about the wear and
tear on my nerves?

1048
01:10:10,475 --> 01:10:12,386
Papa will take care of Kitty.

1049
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:15,988
Baby's gonna have a big diamond ring...

1050
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,023
and a shiny limousine...

1051
01:10:18,835 --> 01:10:21,395
- and a penthouse.
- And Johnny?

1052
01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:23,913
He goes with the penthouse.

1053
01:10:35,395 --> 01:10:36,384
Chris...

1054
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:42,024
How did my pictures get into
Dellarowe's window?

1055
01:10:46,715 --> 01:10:47,465
Oh, Chris!

1056
01:10:48,755 --> 01:10:50,586
Don't be angry with me...

1057
01:10:51,795 --> 01:10:54,229
No I'm not angry,
I just can't understand.

1058
01:10:54,715 --> 01:10:56,148
It's not possible!

1059
01:10:56,315 --> 01:10:58,271
Forgive me, Darling, I...

1060
01:10:58,395 --> 01:11:01,353
I needed money. They were
going to take the furniture back!

1061
01:11:01,915 --> 01:11:03,314
It was humiliating...

1062
01:11:03,395 --> 01:11:06,512
I couldn't ask you for more,
you've been so generous.

1063
01:11:07,315 --> 01:11:11,024
I just couldn't!
So I sold some pictures.

1064
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:13,228
- To Dellarowe?
- Yes.

1065
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,027
You actually sold those pictures?

1066
01:11:17,115 --> 01:11:18,150
Yes.

1067
01:11:18,835 --> 01:11:21,827
I know I shouldn't have
put my name on them but

1068
01:11:22,515 --> 01:11:25,552
Mr. Dellarowe wanted
to know who painted them

1069
01:11:25,635 --> 01:11:27,705
and I just couldn't give him your name.

1070
01:11:28,835 --> 01:11:31,349
Now I can't tell him different... can I?

1071
01:11:31,595 --> 01:11:32,584
No.

1072
01:11:33,315 --> 01:11:37,388
The funny part is that it didn't seem
to make any difference.

1073
01:11:38,275 --> 01:11:40,709
Yes, well the funny part is it
made a great deal of difference.

1074
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:43,785
If I'd brought those pictures
to a man like Dellarowe

1075
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,103
he wouldn't have taken them.

1076
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:47,189
I'm a failure, Kitty.

1077
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:49,945
Oh, you're a great painter, Chris!

1078
01:11:51,115 --> 01:11:54,471
Mr. Dellarowe said so and
so did Mr. Janeway.

1079
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:56,464
That is...

1080
01:11:58,595 --> 01:12:01,553
- they say I am.
- Well they're gonna keep on saying it.

1081
01:12:02,195 --> 01:12:04,265
- Oh, Chris!
- Oh now don't...

1082
01:12:04,355 --> 01:12:06,080
Don't Kitty, now don't cry.

1083
01:12:06,115 --> 01:12:08,310
I'm happy!...
Why, it's just like a dream.

1084
01:12:08,515 --> 01:12:11,427
Oh Chris, you're so good, so kind.

1085
01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:13,586
What difference does it make whose
name is on those pictures...

1086
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:15,347
yours or mine?

1087
01:12:15,595 --> 01:12:17,506
Why, it's just like we were married!

1088
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:20,187
Only I take your name.

1089
01:12:20,995 --> 01:12:24,192
Well, that gives me a little
authority around here.

1090
01:12:25,795 --> 01:12:28,309
I want to paint your picture, Kitty.
How about it?

1091
01:12:33,275 --> 01:12:34,310
Come with me.

1092
01:12:56,155 --> 01:12:59,113
Know what we're going to call this?
"Self-Portrait".

1093
01:13:01,195 --> 01:13:06,223
DELLAROWE GALLERIES
EXHIBITION OF KATHERINE MARCH

1094
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:42,983
- Hello, Damon!
- Hello, Ned.

1095
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:44,704
Hello.

1096
01:13:45,035 --> 01:13:47,833
Well! This is the first time that
I've ever agreed with you, Janeway.

1097
01:13:47,915 --> 01:13:48,904
Thank you.

1098
01:13:49,075 --> 01:13:52,465
I find the painter even more
fascinating than her paintings.

1099
01:13:52,835 --> 01:13:53,824
What's she like?

1100
01:13:54,955 --> 01:13:57,515
Mona Lisa without the smile...
Something hidden.

1101
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,790
Sometimes it seems as if she
were two people.

1102
01:14:01,475 --> 01:14:03,750
I mention that in my notice...
would you care to see it?

1103
01:14:24,675 --> 01:14:26,745
Mr. Cross, there's a man outside
who says he wants to see you.

1104
01:14:27,555 --> 01:14:29,193
- Who?
- I didn't get no name, sir.

1105
01:14:29,275 --> 01:14:31,027
But he says he was a detective.

1106
01:14:58,675 --> 01:15:01,872
- You the detective?
- Well, I used to be, Mr. Cross.

1107
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:04,987
Don't you recognize me?

1108
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:06,985
No.

1109
01:15:11,355 --> 01:15:12,424
Homer!

1110
01:15:12,915 --> 01:15:14,064
Quite a shock, huh?

1111
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:16,028
Now don't faint, Mr. Cross.

1112
01:15:16,115 --> 01:15:18,470
Keep your head.
I'll explain everything.

1113
01:15:18,955 --> 01:15:21,105
Well, I was in trouble at the time,
I'd been...

1114
01:15:21,915 --> 01:15:24,713
collecting a little money from
the speakeasies along the waterfront.

1115
01:15:25,675 --> 01:15:27,347
Word got around to headquarters.

1116
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:30,550
I was up for investigation.

1117
01:15:30,955 --> 01:15:32,354
One night I'm down by Brooklyn Bridge...

1118
01:15:32,435 --> 01:15:34,426
trying to fix things up...

1119
01:15:34,515 --> 01:15:36,233
A man runs into the speakeasy and says:

1120
01:15:36,315 --> 01:15:38,306
"A woman just jumped off the bridge. "

1121
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:41,627
So I run out and tear off my coat,
jump in...

1122
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,469
The way I felt, I'm hoping
I don't come up again.

1123
01:15:45,995 --> 01:15:47,030
You mind?

1124
01:15:54,075 --> 01:15:57,147
Well, there I am, swimming
around in the dark...

1125
01:15:57,235 --> 01:16:00,272
I had hold of her hat once... the next
thing I know, I'm all tired out.

1126
01:16:00,475 --> 01:16:02,750
I heard a tugboat whistle,
and right down on top of me...

1127
01:16:02,835 --> 01:16:05,429
comes a coal barge...

1128
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,426
so I grab ahold and climb aboard.

1129
01:16:07,995 --> 01:16:10,714
I look down at my hand,
and what do you think I got?

1130
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:13,507
Her pocketbook!

1131
01:16:13,595 --> 01:16:16,473
That's what I grabbed ahold of
when I thought it was her hat!

1132
01:16:16,835 --> 01:16:20,874
And inside is 2700 dollars
in folded money!

1133
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:24,194
Imagine anyone committing suicide
with that much money!

1134
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:27,865
Well the coal barge unloaded
on a banana boat...

1135
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:31,425
bound for Honduras...
Well, I went with it.

1136
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:34,546
But if you're not dead...

1137
01:16:35,635 --> 01:16:38,274
Then I'm not really married to Adele,
am I?

1138
01:16:43,035 --> 01:16:45,026
What's it worth it to you for me to...

1139
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:47,626
keep my mouth shut and just...

1140
01:16:48,435 --> 01:16:49,948
fade away?

1141
01:16:50,635 --> 01:16:51,750
Yes but...

1142
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:53,587
If you're Adele's husband...

1143
01:16:55,155 --> 01:16:58,670
Wait a minute. I can see you need Adele.
I need money.

1144
01:17:00,635 --> 01:17:01,829
You're a cashier...

1145
01:17:01,915 --> 01:17:04,349
it ought to be easy for you to get
your hands on a couple of thousand...

1146
01:17:05,915 --> 01:17:08,634
Well, I... I... I couldn't
do a thing like that.

1147
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:13,786
- You're going back to her?
- No!

1148
01:17:14,315 --> 01:17:16,590
But not to do you a favor, Mister!

1149
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,786
I'm clearing out for Adele's sake.

1150
01:17:21,635 --> 01:17:24,069
And don't think you're gonna get
any peace of mind, either.

1151
01:17:24,635 --> 01:17:26,944
I might turn up again someday!

1152
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:30,752
She'd kick you out in a minute
for a man like me.

1153
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:36,147
I'll get you some money.

1154
01:17:36,755 --> 01:17:38,427
Now you're using your head!

1155
01:17:38,715 --> 01:17:40,228
But you'll have to wait here.

1156
01:17:40,315 --> 01:17:42,624
I can't get it until after we
close at six o'clock.

1157
01:17:43,235 --> 01:17:44,292
I'll wait, Cross.

1158
01:17:47,075 --> 01:17:49,305
- Hello, Johnny. Hello, Kitty.
- Hiya, Marchetti!

1159
01:17:49,395 --> 01:17:50,464
Hi.

1160
01:17:52,555 --> 01:17:54,352
Don't forget the champagne, Baby!

1161
01:17:54,915 --> 01:17:57,190
Nice car you have, Johnny.
She go fast, eh?

1162
01:17:57,795 --> 01:17:59,626
I'd like to see any cop
trying to catch me.

1163
01:18:00,315 --> 01:18:02,670
Say, I'll give you four bits
for a bucket full of that ice...

1164
01:18:02,915 --> 01:18:04,143
Okay, Johnny.

1165
01:18:09,955 --> 01:18:11,388
Can I borrow the icepick?

1166
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:14,025
- You give it back, eh?
- Sure, sure!

1167
01:18:16,835 --> 01:18:17,870
Thank you.

1168
01:18:21,555 --> 01:18:22,874
Only 200?

1169
01:18:23,635 --> 01:18:25,626
Well, that's all I could get.

1170
01:18:25,995 --> 01:18:28,589
Don't you think your wife's
more than that?

1171
01:18:30,195 --> 01:18:33,505
Look, I want you to get all
that's coming to you, Mr. Higgins.

1172
01:18:34,595 --> 01:18:36,233
Now what about the insurance money?

1173
01:18:36,315 --> 01:18:37,304
The insurance?

1174
01:18:37,395 --> 01:18:39,909
2000 dollars... on your life.

1175
01:18:40,195 --> 01:18:42,265
Adele collected it.
It's really yours, isn't it?

1176
01:18:43,995 --> 01:18:45,633
She keeps it right in her bedroom.

1177
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,673
Now I wouldn't touch a penny of it,
Mr. Higgins, but...

1178
01:18:49,355 --> 01:18:52,074
if you took it,
it would be perfectly legal.

1179
01:18:52,955 --> 01:18:55,867
- But just how would I get it?
- That's easy.

1180
01:18:57,235 --> 01:18:59,795
This is the night that she
always goes out to the movies.

1181
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,666
I let you in, you take the money...

1182
01:19:04,835 --> 01:19:06,268
I let you out.

1183
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:09,833
But why don't you get it?

1184
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:12,224
Why, I've got to be able to
say that I didn't touch it.

1185
01:19:13,235 --> 01:19:14,748
You know Adele...

1186
01:19:19,115 --> 01:19:20,707
What if she don't go out...

1187
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:24,707
and I show up...
Your goose is cooked, isn't it?

1188
01:19:26,235 --> 01:19:27,953
Yes, but...

1189
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:31,150
- I can play it safe.
- How?

1190
01:19:32,075 --> 01:19:36,114
Well, you come along the street
at 11 o'clock tonight...

1191
01:20:23,755 --> 01:20:24,824
Okay?

1192
01:20:25,235 --> 01:20:27,749
Why are you whispering?
How come the lights are out?

1193
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:30,873
Mrs. Michaels. You remember
Mrs. Michaels, don't you?

1194
01:20:31,835 --> 01:20:33,393
- Oh, yeah.
- And the neighbors.

1195
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:42,794
Where is the money?

1196
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:45,514
In there... in the bottom
drawer of the chest.

1197
01:20:48,155 --> 01:20:50,146
Okay, give me the flashlight.

1198
01:21:01,435 --> 01:21:03,232
Police!

1199
01:21:03,315 --> 01:21:04,589
Murder!

1200
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:06,747
Christopher!

1201
01:21:06,915 --> 01:21:08,667
Christopher, turn on the lights!

1202
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:36,504
Johnny!

1203
01:21:37,795 --> 01:21:39,751
- Oh, Johnny!
- Lazy Legs!

1204
01:21:39,835 --> 01:21:41,348
Jeepers, I love you.

1205
01:21:46,555 --> 01:21:47,783
What's that?

1206
01:21:57,115 --> 01:21:58,468
Chris?

1207
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:08,946
- Johnny, is it Chris?
- Call him, quick.

1208
01:22:11,115 --> 01:22:12,230
Chris!

1209
01:22:13,075 --> 01:22:14,144
Chris!

1210
01:22:14,355 --> 01:22:15,834
I ought to push you over on your head!

1211
01:22:15,915 --> 01:22:19,032
How did I know he was coming here
tonight? I don't understand it.

1212
01:22:19,115 --> 01:22:21,390
- You don't understand anything!
- But why get sore at me?

1213
01:22:21,475 --> 01:22:24,194
Well what are the use of my brains if
I'm tied up with a dumb cluck like you?

1214
01:22:24,275 --> 01:22:26,743
- I told you to watch your step,
didn't I? - Right, blame it on me.

1215
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:28,905
Oh why did you keep me here tonight?
I didn't want to stay.

1216
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:31,430
Johnny! Don't talk like that.

1217
01:22:31,555 --> 01:22:33,227
Well it's the truth,
I'm fed up with you!

1218
01:22:33,595 --> 01:22:34,664
Johnny!

1219
01:22:34,755 --> 01:22:37,064
That's the only thing you ever
understood, I'm through with you!

1220
01:22:50,935 --> 01:22:52,368
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1221
01:23:01,095 --> 01:23:02,813
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1222
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:09,327
Oh Lord, have mercy upon us sinners!

1223
01:23:09,655 --> 01:23:12,488
The way of the sinner
is made plain with stones.

1224
01:23:12,695 --> 01:23:15,892
But at the end thereof
is the pit of Hell.

1225
01:23:16,615 --> 01:23:20,244
Oh Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner!

1226
01:23:20,655 --> 01:23:23,647
- Hallelujah! Amen!
- Hallelujah! Amen!

1227
01:23:27,455 --> 01:23:30,128
Millie? Yeah, Kitty.
You seen Johnny?

1228
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,843
Oh, I thought he'd go to Tiny's.
Was he getting tight?

1229
01:23:35,175 --> 01:23:36,608
Oh, just a fight.

1230
01:23:36,775 --> 01:23:38,333
Listen, he can't live without me

1231
01:23:38,415 --> 01:23:40,531
any more than I can live without him.

1232
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:43,448
Said he was coming back here?
To beat me up?

1233
01:23:43,855 --> 01:23:47,131
Jeepers, the way that guy
shoots off his mouth!

1234
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:50,283
Oh you don't have to warn me,
that's just the way he talks.

1235
01:23:50,935 --> 01:23:53,165
If you were in love you'd understand...

1236
01:23:54,255 --> 01:23:56,450
Oh stop it!
Johnny wouldn't kill a fly.

1237
01:23:58,815 --> 01:24:00,726
That's love, Honey!

1238
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:05,413
Here he is now!
And has he got a bun on...

1239
01:24:05,655 --> 01:24:06,929
Goodbye, Hon!

1240
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:08,403
Hello, Johnny.

1241
01:24:11,735 --> 01:24:13,532
Come on, Johnny, I heard you.

1242
01:24:26,255 --> 01:24:27,927
You lied to me, Kitty.

1243
01:24:29,255 --> 01:24:30,483
It was him, wasn't it?

1244
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:32,611
Can I help it if I'm in love?

1245
01:24:33,895 --> 01:24:35,772
No, it's just an infatuation.

1246
01:24:36,495 --> 01:24:38,963
You couldn't love
a man like that, Kitty.

1247
01:24:40,255 --> 01:24:41,608
He's evil!

1248
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,172
He wouldn't let you alone,
isn't that right?

1249
01:24:47,055 --> 01:24:49,011
I wanted to kill him.

1250
01:24:49,215 --> 01:24:50,694
But it's wrong.

1251
01:24:50,815 --> 01:24:52,294
Why did you come here?

1252
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:56,445
- To ask you to marry me.
- And what about your wife?

1253
01:24:56,535 --> 01:24:58,491
- I haven't any wife, that's finished.
- For cat's sake, you didn't...

1254
01:24:58,575 --> 01:25:00,893
Her husband turned up, I'm free.

1255
01:25:03,855 --> 01:25:06,528
Oh now... don't cry, Kitty.

1256
01:25:06,895 --> 01:25:09,455
I know how you feel,
but that's all over now.

1257
01:25:10,695 --> 01:25:13,971
We all make mistakes.
I don't care what's happened, I...

1258
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:16,767
I can marry you now, I...

1259
01:25:17,055 --> 01:25:18,454
I want you to be my wife.

1260
01:25:18,775 --> 01:25:21,335
We'll go away together,
away far off, so...

1261
01:25:21,895 --> 01:25:23,886
You can forget this other man.

1262
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:27,369
Don't cry, Kitty.
Please don't cry.

1263
01:25:28,455 --> 01:25:30,730
I'm not crying you fool, I'm laughing!

1264
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:32,649
Kitty...

1265
01:25:33,535 --> 01:25:36,686
Oh you idiot, how can a man be so dumb?

1266
01:25:36,815 --> 01:25:37,964
Kitty...

1267
01:25:42,535 --> 01:25:44,969
I've wanted to laugh in your face
ever since I first met you!

1268
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,534
You're old and ugly

1269
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,652
and I'm sick of you.
Sick! Sick! Sick!

1270
01:25:49,735 --> 01:25:50,884
Kitty, for Heaven sake!

1271
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:54,007
You kill Johnny?
I'd like to see you try.

1272
01:25:54,009 --> 01:25:57,007
Why, he'd break every bone in your body!
He's a man.

1273
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,813
You wanna marry me, you?!

1274
01:25:58,815 --> 01:26:00,647
Get out of here! Get out!

1275
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:03,330
Get away from me! Chris! Chris!

1276
01:26:03,415 --> 01:26:04,768
Get away from me! Chris!

1277
01:26:04,855 --> 01:26:06,129
Chris!

1278
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,684
Hey!

1279
01:26:21,975 --> 01:26:24,569
You better look out, Johnny.
You'll kill somebody!

1280
01:28:05,855 --> 01:28:07,085
Chris!

1281
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:34,368
Hold on, Chris, wait a minute.

1282
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,247
What made you do it, Chris?

1283
01:28:39,775 --> 01:28:42,084
When these officers called me,
I wouldn't believe it.

1284
01:28:42,175 --> 01:28:44,814
- We were tipped off on the telephone.
- By a man named Higgins.

1285
01:28:45,095 --> 01:28:47,245
I checked the cash before you came in.

1286
01:28:48,255 --> 01:28:49,927
You know how much is missing?

1287
01:28:51,295 --> 01:28:54,093
- Over 1200 dollars.
- We'll take him along.

1288
01:28:54,175 --> 01:28:55,369
You can make the complaint, Mr. Hogarth.

1289
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,013
Hold on, Morris.

1290
01:28:58,135 --> 01:29:00,126
- I just can't do it.
- But Mr. Hogarth...

1291
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:02,729
I know you've done your duty
and I'm obliged to you.

1292
01:29:03,695 --> 01:29:06,289
There's a box of cigars on the table,
take them along with you.

1293
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:08,843
Okay, Mr. Hogarth, it's up to you.

1294
01:29:17,455 --> 01:29:19,650
Chris, it was a woman, wasn't it?

1295
01:29:21,175 --> 01:29:22,528
I thought so.

1296
01:29:23,935 --> 01:29:25,812
I'm not going to put you
in jail, Chris...

1297
01:29:26,255 --> 01:29:28,769
only of course you're through.

1298
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,764
Well I didn't do anything!
I want a law...

1299
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,849
I want a lawyer.

1300
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,604
- Where was he picked up?
- Riverside Drive.

1301
01:29:57,650 --> 01:29:59,174
He tried to get away in the
murdered girl's car.

1302
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,900
That was my car!

1303
01:30:03,775 --> 01:30:05,652
This is yours, too.

1304
01:30:05,735 --> 01:30:08,693
It's got your initials on it,
but it's her blood.

1305
01:30:10,095 --> 01:30:12,928
Here's 140 dollars that was taken
out of her pocketbook.

1306
01:30:13,015 --> 01:30:14,414
That was mine.

1307
01:30:15,975 --> 01:30:19,684
It's her diamond ring, worth
5 or 600 dollars.

1308
01:30:21,935 --> 01:30:23,891
You guys know a lot, don't you?

1309
01:30:24,295 --> 01:30:26,092
It cost 1200!

1310
01:30:27,175 --> 01:30:29,291
These are personal jewelry.

1311
01:30:30,215 --> 01:30:33,013
Not much value, but he cleaned her out.

1312
01:30:33,095 --> 01:30:35,563
But why wouldn't I? She didn't
have any more use for it, did she?

1313
01:30:41,535 --> 01:30:42,604
Listen you guys, I want a lawyer!

1314
01:30:42,695 --> 01:30:44,526
I'm a citizen, I got my rights!

1315
01:30:47,255 --> 01:30:49,291
This belongs to you too, huh?

1316
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,206
It's got your fingerprints on it.

1317
01:30:51,455 --> 01:30:53,173
Well naturally, I picked it up.

1318
01:30:53,255 --> 01:30:54,654
How did I know she was dead?

1319
01:30:54,735 --> 01:30:56,248
I thought she was asleep, at first.

1320
01:31:00,175 --> 01:31:02,400
She didn't paint those pictures!

1321
01:31:02,535 --> 01:31:06,050
Old Cross isn't as dumb as he looks.
He painted them!

1322
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,600
The accused brought me two pictures.

1323
01:31:08,775 --> 01:31:11,200
He told me Miss March painted them.

1324
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,647
In my expert opinion, there's
no doubt about it...

1325
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,932
She was a very great artist.

1326
01:31:17,255 --> 01:31:18,483
She told me she was an artist

1327
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:21,408
when she rented the studio,
he was with her.

1328
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:23,372
I didn't like him then
and I don't like him now.

1329
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,005
Yeah, he was mean when he was drunk.

1330
01:31:26,175 --> 01:31:29,200
He said he was gonna fix her when
he left my place around 2 a. m.

1331
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,810
That's when I tell him:

1332
01:31:30,895 --> 01:31:32,800
"You look out, Johnny,
you're gonna kill somebody. "

1333
01:31:33,095 --> 01:31:34,687
So he kills her with my icepick.

1334
01:31:35,095 --> 01:31:37,500
And then I heard her say
"Hello, Johnny", before she hung up.

1335
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,500
He was there, all right.

1336
01:31:39,975 --> 01:31:42,000
But what I don't understand is this
talk about her being an artist.

1337
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,400
I never saw her paint.

1338
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,700
That was one of her peculiar traits:

1339
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,900
She never let anyone see her paint.

1340
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:50,366
I've compared her handwriting
with her signature.

1341
01:31:50,735 --> 01:31:51,850
There's no question.

1342
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:54,605
Mr. Cross paint?

1343
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:57,649
He only copied her work. He's a thief!

1344
01:31:57,895 --> 01:32:01,205
He stole from me, from his employer,
from Katherine March.

1345
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:05,285
My wife, I mean my former wife,
is correct.

1346
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,168
I really can't paint.

1347
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:12,494
My copies were so bad I
had to destroy them.

1348
01:32:12,575 --> 01:32:14,452
For cat's sake! He's lying!

1349
01:32:26,215 --> 01:32:28,445
- Hello, Mr. Cross!
- Hello.

1350
01:32:29,055 --> 01:32:30,886
Tom Crocker, Evening Globe.

1351
01:32:31,535 --> 01:32:33,048
Oh yes, Tom Crocker.

1352
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:35,764
Joe Williams, Morning World...
Conway's with the Ledger.

1353
01:32:35,855 --> 01:32:37,049
Hello.

1354
01:32:38,055 --> 01:32:39,488
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.

1355
01:32:40,215 --> 01:32:41,364
Going to Sing Sing?

1356
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:44,004
Yeah. I don't like
to cover executions...

1357
01:32:44,095 --> 01:32:46,086
but I must say this is one I don't mind.

1358
01:32:46,175 --> 01:32:47,654
You sure cooked County's goose,
Mr. Cross...

1359
01:32:47,735 --> 01:32:49,805
when you testified you couldn't paint.

1360
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:51,813
Nobody cooked County's goose
except Johnny...

1361
01:32:51,895 --> 01:32:53,965
the way he shot off his mouth.

1362
01:32:54,055 --> 01:32:57,252
He was a dead pigeon when he dragged
the girl's name through the mud.

1363
01:32:57,335 --> 01:32:58,814
I watched the jury.

1364
01:32:58,895 --> 01:33:01,409
If he'd kept his trap shut, he might
have got off with his life.

1365
01:33:01,935 --> 01:33:03,448
Sure, the evidence
was only circumstantial.

1366
01:33:03,535 --> 01:33:06,413
What do you mean?
He got a fair trial, didn't he?

1367
01:33:06,495 --> 01:33:08,247
Yeah, but there's always a doubt.

1368
01:33:08,615 --> 01:33:11,129
I suppose you fellas are going to say
it was a miscarriage of justice!

1369
01:33:11,575 --> 01:33:13,850
That someone is getting
away with murder?

1370
01:33:14,095 --> 01:33:15,926
Not me, there's no such thing!

1371
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:18,126
Mr. Cross, nobody gets away with murder.

1372
01:33:19,255 --> 01:33:21,849
- How's that?
- Oh, don't get him started!

1373
01:33:22,175 --> 01:33:25,247
He'll talk your ear off,
that's his pet theory.

1374
01:33:26,335 --> 01:33:28,291
All right, go ahead
and laugh all you like.

1375
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:30,013
But no one escapes punishment.

1376
01:33:30,295 --> 01:33:33,048
I figure we have a little
courtroom right in here:

1377
01:33:33,335 --> 01:33:35,326
Judge, jury and executioner.

1378
01:33:37,015 --> 01:33:38,334
I don't get it.

1379
01:33:38,495 --> 01:33:41,055
Murder never solves anything,
how about it, fellas?

1380
01:33:41,135 --> 01:33:42,204
You've covered lots of trials.

1381
01:33:42,295 --> 01:33:44,206
I'm sorry, but I have to
admit you're right.

1382
01:33:44,575 --> 01:33:47,169
The problem just moves in here
where it can never get out.

1383
01:33:47,535 --> 01:33:50,003
Right here in solitary. So what?

1384
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:52,166
So you go right on punishing yourself.

1385
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:54,843
You can't get away with it. Never.

1386
01:33:55,455 --> 01:33:57,286
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

1387
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:59,935
Well you haven't seen as much of
murder as I have, Mr. Cross.

1388
01:34:00,255 --> 01:34:03,247
I'd rather have the judge give me the
works than have to do it to myself.

1389
01:34:09,055 --> 01:34:10,170
What time do they throw the switch?

1390
01:34:13,535 --> 01:34:14,854
11 o'clock.

1391
01:34:49,695 --> 01:34:52,334
I didn't do it,
I tell you I didn't do it!

1392
01:34:52,415 --> 01:34:54,133
Won't anyone believe me?

1393
01:34:54,215 --> 01:34:56,365
Give me a break, somebody!
I never got a square deal in my life.

1394
01:34:56,455 --> 01:34:59,970
Won't somebody,
somebody give me a break...

1395
01:36:02,335 --> 01:36:03,450
Johnny!

1396
01:36:03,815 --> 01:36:05,533
Johnny!

1397
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:08,366
Oh, Johnny! Johnny!

1398
01:36:10,935 --> 01:36:13,529
<i>Lazy Legs, Lazy Legs...</i>

1399
01:36:13,695 --> 01:36:15,890
<i>Johnny darling... Johnny darling...</i>

1400
01:36:16,215 --> 01:36:19,730
<i>I'm here, baby...
Jeepers I love you, Johnny...</i>

1401
01:36:21,735 --> 01:36:22,963
<i>Johnny.</i>

1402
01:36:25,535 --> 01:36:28,368
<i>Lazy Legs, Lazy Legs...</i>

1403
01:36:28,455 --> 01:36:31,367
<i>Jeepers I love you, Johnny...</i>

1404
01:36:54,255 --> 01:36:57,645
<i>Oh Johnny, now we're together...</i>

1405
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,046
<i>Yeah... He killed me too, Kitty...</i>

1406
01:37:02,535 --> 01:37:05,208
<i>He brought us together, Johnny...</i>

1407
01:37:05,295 --> 01:37:06,933
<i>Forever...</i>

1408
01:37:07,775 --> 01:37:09,049
Kitty...

1409
01:37:09,135 --> 01:37:11,888
<i>Oh you idiot, how can a man be so dumb?</i>

1410
01:37:12,255 --> 01:37:13,688
No, Kitty, no!

1411
01:37:14,095 --> 01:37:16,086
<i>You wanted to marry me? You?</i>

1412
01:37:16,415 --> 01:37:19,373
<i>She's mine, Chris, mine... forever.</i>

1413
01:37:19,455 --> 01:37:20,774
Leave me alone!

1414
01:37:22,135 --> 01:37:25,571
<i>You killed me, Chris, you're old
and ugly and you killed me...</i>

1415
01:37:25,655 --> 01:37:28,613
<i>You killed me, you killed me,
you killed me!</i>

1416
01:37:28,695 --> 01:37:30,048
No, Kitty, it's him!

1417
01:37:30,935 --> 01:37:34,371
You were innocent, you were pure, that's
what he killed in you. He's the murderer

1418
01:37:34,495 --> 01:37:36,406
<i>No, he's not. Not Johnny.</i>

1419
01:37:36,575 --> 01:37:39,373
<i>You see, Chris? She loves me...</i>

1420
01:37:39,655 --> 01:37:43,409
That's why you had to die.
You're the one I killed.

1421
01:37:44,135 --> 01:37:45,773
<i>She's mine, Chris.</i>

1422
01:37:47,095 --> 01:37:49,051
<i>You kill Johnny?</i>

1423
01:37:49,135 --> 01:37:51,091
<i>I'd like to see you try.
- Kitty...</i>

1424
01:37:51,175 --> 01:37:53,405
<i>He'd break every bone in your body.
- Kitty!</i>

1425
01:37:53,495 --> 01:37:54,723
<i>He's a man.
- Kitty!</i>

1426
01:38:08,255 --> 01:38:10,610
<i>Johnny... Johnny...</i>

1427
01:38:11,895 --> 01:38:14,363
<i>Oh, Johnny!... Johnny!</i>

1428
01:38:18,055 --> 01:38:20,125
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1429
01:38:26,855 --> 01:38:28,288
There's something wrong in there.

1430
01:38:53,895 --> 01:38:55,886
It's all right old man,
it's all right...

1431
01:38:57,295 --> 01:38:59,047
<i>Johnny.</i>

1432
01:38:59,335 --> 01:39:01,007
<i>Oh Johnny.</i>

1433
01:39:01,575 --> 01:39:03,213
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>

1434
01:39:26,415 --> 01:39:28,167
Get up, come on, get up, get up!

1435
01:39:30,735 --> 01:39:32,248
Oh, it's you.

1436
01:39:32,735 --> 01:39:34,487
Haven't I told you
to keep out of this park?

1437
01:39:34,655 --> 01:39:36,134
You know the Mayor's orders.

1438
01:39:45,295 --> 01:39:46,967
Get on down to the Bowery,
where you belong.

1439
01:39:49,335 --> 01:39:50,734
Come on, come on.

1440
01:40:02,175 --> 01:40:03,608
Who's that rick?

1441
01:40:03,975 --> 01:40:05,693
He has a crazy idea he killed
a couple of people...

1442
01:40:05,775 --> 01:40:08,243
five or six years ago.
Can't get it off his mind.

1443
01:40:08,575 --> 01:40:10,531
Always trying to give himself up.

1444
01:40:12,575 --> 01:40:16,124
Wants to be tried and executed...
you know these nuts.

1445
01:41:01,655 --> 01:41:02,929
Well, there goes her masterpiece.

1446
01:41:10,175 --> 01:41:11,767
I really hate to part with it.

1447
01:41:12,135 --> 01:41:15,411
For 10,000 dollars I shouldn't
think you'd mind, Mr. Dellarowe!

1448
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:32,774
<i>Johnny.</i>

1449
01:41:35,295 --> 01:41:36,933
<i>Oh Johnny.</i>

1450
01:41:39,215 --> 01:41:41,285
<i>Lazy Legs.</i>

1451
01:41:44,295 --> 01:41:46,331
<i>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</i>
