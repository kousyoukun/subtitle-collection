1
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,320
Hey, Jenny. That was a wonderful share, tonight.

2
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,540
"Chapter 36, the Quarter-Deck.

3
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,300
"Enter Ahab. Then, all.

4
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,800
It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe,

5
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,310
that one morning, shortly after breakfast,

6
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,550
Ahab, as was his wont,

7
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,350
ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,170
'It's a white whale, I say 'resumed Ahab,

9
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,120
as he threw down the top-maul.

10
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,200
A white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men,

11
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,620
Tommy?

12
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,990
Jesus!

13
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,380
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,790
Well, I was just passing through

15
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,720
and I figured why not have a belt with the old man.

16
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,550
Yeah.

17
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,390
She looks good.

18
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,350
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

19
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,400
Well, you always did take good care of her.

20
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,350
Paddy Conlon.

21
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,070
Man of priorities.

22
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,580
I got a little something for you.

23
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,750
Mom always said, "Never go anywhere empty-handed."

24
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,080
She did.

25
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,920
That's not for me any more, Tommy.

26
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,630
What? You changed brands?

27
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,020
Let's go inside, huh?

28
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,610
Tommy!

29
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,270
Come on, let's go inside.

30
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,570
I like what you've done with the place.

31
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,680
Yeah, I appreciate that.

32
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,800
There's not much of a woman's touch around here.

33
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,640
Yeah, well...

34
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,400
And no more women for me, Tommy.

35
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,110
Yeah.

36
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,410
It must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays.

37
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,570
Here you go.

38
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,250
Coffee?

39
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,590
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years

40
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,160
and you're not gonna have a drink with him?

41
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,370
Come on. I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

42
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,330
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

43
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,350
- Come on, it's just a drink. - No.

44
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,960
He's a school teacher down in Philly.

45
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,220
Remember Tess?

46
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,010
They had two beautiful little girls.

47
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,490
So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.

48
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,070
I think mom kept calling out for him,

49
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,340
but he wasn't around.

50
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,800
I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks, huh?

51
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,590
Who knew?

52
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,680
So, you gonna ask about her,

53
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,440
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

54
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,650
- I know. - You know? What do you know? Huh?

55
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,440
Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west to get away from you,

56
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,360
that once we hit the water, we drove north, too?

57
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,150
When I got sober, I hired a man to find you.

58
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,840
And is that one of the 12 steps?

59
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,160
Or does a guy like you get 24?

60
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,870
Just 12.

61
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,310
Did your guy tell you what you needed to know?

62
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,020
Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

63
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,310
But you were in the Marines.

64
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,110
That was all.

65
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,910
That was enough.

66
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,280
Well, that's too bad,

67
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,540
'cause you could've gotten some good details.

68
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,070
You could've heard about her coughing up blood

69
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,170
on her knees in a shit box with no heat.

70
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,030
Having me rub her down with holy water,

71
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,880
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,630
All the time waiting for your pal, Jesus, to save her.

73
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,440
Did your man tell you that?

74
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
I'm sorry, Tommy.

75
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,370
Well, it's good to know that you're sorry, pop.

76
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,490
It goes a long way.

77
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,970
I think I liked you better when you were a drunk.

78
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,140
All right, then. All right, all right, all right.

79
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,850
You say I can, but you say I can't.

80
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,150
- What about if we all get a unicorn? - No.

81
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,780
- Don't you want a unicorn? - No.

82
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,410
What's going on up here?

83
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,160
- Oh, my goodness. - Well, I'm not sure,

84
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,870
but I think daddy is now a princess.

85
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,750
- Daddy, you look so handsome. - Do I?

86
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,580
- He's a very pretty princess. - We're painting Daddy's face.

87
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,750
Yeah, you are.

88
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,760
Okay. Yeah. Em, you wanna open your presents?

89
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,980
Yeah? You wanna do present time?

90
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,010
- Okay. - Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

91
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,690
- All right! It's time for presents! - I have to put this down.

92
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,730
- Here. You wanna put it down? - Presents time!

93
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,730
- Everybody, come bring your presents! - What is it? What is it?

94
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,610
Let's start with this one. How about that, Emily?

95
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,940
- All right. - Happy birthday, Emily.

96
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,650
- What did you get? What did you get? - Babe?

97
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
It's an awfully big box.

98
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,320
It's her birthday. Come on.

99
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,940
I know, babe,

100
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,160
but that's why you call it a budget.

101
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,830
You set it and you don't budge.

102
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,830
- This one's mine. - Hey, open the big box!

103
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,370
It's okay.

104
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,000
- I love you. Be good, okay? - Bye, Mommy.

105
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,340
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

106
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,840
Hey, babe. I'm late.

107
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,350
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls, she's got to get on the road.

108
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,810
- They've been fed, they just need a bath. - I'm on it.

109
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,230
Okay, can you get them to bed at a reasonable time tonight?

110
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,560
Because, after the party, they're just exhausted.

111
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,940
Where's the rest of that skirt?

112
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,360
Babe.

113
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,730
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight,

114
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,190
you give me a call, okay?

115
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,150
Yeah, just like you gave me a call when those temple frat boys

116
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,990
decided to smash up your face.

117
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,160
I told you, most nights,

118
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,240
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

119
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,420
but, every now and then, I need some action.

120
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,310
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.

121
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,420
I'll see what I can do about that.

122
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,170
Promises, promises.

123
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,720
And we return here on MMA Live,

124
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,980
Jon Anik, alongside the

125
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,140
billionaire fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,

126
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,160
the Tapout crew is here,

127
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,270
Punk and Skrape are in the building.

128
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,270
Now, J. J., what led to this project

129
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,820
that is really redefining mixed martial arts here in the States?

130
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,360
Well, mixed martial arts is

131
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
a sport I've been incredibly passionate about,

132
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,110
and as far as where the idea for Sparta came from,

133
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,500
I've always really dug the Grand Prix format,

134
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,990
so I tracked these guys down.

135
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,910
And when J. J. came to us,

136
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,870
he said he wanted to create the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts.

137
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,040
And he decided to put up the $5 million purse, too.

138
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,480
Well, there you have it, it shall be done.

139
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,090
Hedge fund king, J. J. Riley,

140
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,710
going from the lions' den of Wall Street to the cage,

141
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,310
and promoting the biggest

142
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,470
winner-take-all tournament in MMA history. Sparta.

143
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,590
Doing good. One more time.

144
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,720
Fitzy still own this?

145
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,210
I don't know no Fitzy.

146
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,050
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

147
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,810
Can I help you with something?

148
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,400
How does it work?

149
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,400
Thirty-five a month with locker.

150
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,650
We're open at 7:00, lights out at 11:00.

151
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,160
So you want to join?

152
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,740
Sure.

153
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,530
Put your name and contact info on the card.

154
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,670
Thank you.

155
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,680
All right. There's a lesson in this, too, okay?

156
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,020
Hold on, Tito.

157
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,310
So, we have a body at rest,

158
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,890
and you have the bat which needs...

159
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,850
- Acceleration. - Acceleration, okay.

160
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,270
If you have enough acceleration,

161
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,940
you might have a chance of breaking the body at rest.

162
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,650
- Okay. All right. You ready? - Piece of cake.

163
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,320
Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!

164
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,860
Come on, man!

165
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,700
Come on, son!

166
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,260
All right! All right. There we go.

167
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,620
Well done, Tito. Well done.

168
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,630
Remind me not to mess with you.

169
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,670
Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.

170
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,040
So, have we got it?

171
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,760
Force equals mass times acceleration, we got it.

172
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,310
All right. Has everybody else got it?

173
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,470
- Yeah. - Yes? Okay, good. All right.

174
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
The third law...

175
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,480
How many laws this dude got?

176
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,390
- The dude? - Yes, the dude.

177
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,350
The dude has three, all right?

178
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,320
Newton, the dude, says that for every action,

179
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,320
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

180
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,740
For example,

181
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,990
if K.C. does not stop the action of sending texts in class

182
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,780
and tell her posse outside to beat it,

183
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,230
then my reaction might be

184
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,620
to send her down to principal Zito's office.

185
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,000
Thus setting the world back in proper balance.

186
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,340
Mr. C, I put it away.

187
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,040
All right, before you go,

188
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,850
I have your tests from last week.

189
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,800
Just work it out.

190
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,470
Stop downing.

191
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,730
Pick up the hands.

192
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,520
Tighten it up!

193
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,570
Use your right.

194
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,190
Seal his hands, come on.

195
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,950
Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!

196
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,990
Go light!

197
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,040
I said, go light!

198
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,120
God damn it!

199
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,170
Where do you find these girls?

200
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,640
We got a tournament coming up,

201
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,170
you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

202
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,260
Oh, jeez.

203
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,350
Fenroy, get me some ice.

204
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,740
And call that Puerto Rican kid,

205
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,140
the one that fights out of the bottoms.

206
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,140
If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks.

207
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,850
Yo, I'll fight him.

208
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,560
Do me a favor, guy, go back to your bag.

209
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,890
We don't need anybody else getting hurt. Take a walk.

210
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,400
Let's go. Watch his neck.

211
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,690
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

212
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,490
did you leave Mick and Paulie at home today?

213
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,950
His phone's disconnected.

214
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,290
Then go through the list. Find me somebody.

215
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,750
Get me Joe Bones.

216
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,300
All I'm saying is that if you need somebody to help you,

217
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,090
I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.

218
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,680
You ever fought before?

219
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Yeah.

220
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,600
Hey, this guy signed a waiver?

221
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,730
All good.

222
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,070
- What's your name? - Tommy.

223
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,340
You get tuned up in here, it's on you,

224
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,750
- Tom. - Sure, no problem. No problem.

225
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,290
Come on in.

226
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,260
Let's go. All right, let's go.

227
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,300
Hey. Watch that teeth.

228
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,510
Are you gonna be a hero? All right.

229
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,810
Come on. Check that kick.

230
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,270
Easy.

231
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,980
Come on, Dog, you can do it. Let's go, come on.

232
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,820
- Good job. Good job! - There we go!

233
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,100
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.

234
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,160
Don't let him take your back!

235
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
- Dog, get up. - Get up!

236
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,250
Cover up, cover up!

237
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,840
Don't give him your back. Don't give him your back!

238
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,180
- Cover up! - Come on, Dog!

239
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,130
Cover up, damn it!

240
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,740
You owe me 200 bucks.

241
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,150
This one here. See,

242
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,720
this is the new appraisal figures that came in.

243
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,260
Yeah.

244
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,510
And this is how it affects the monthly, it turns into that.

245
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,970
And the total value of the loan,

246
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,470
over the life of the loan, is that.

247
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,800
As you can see, that's just the way it is.

248
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,510
It puts you upside down, that's the problem.

249
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,770
It's the county that did the assessment, not the bank.

250
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,230
So, the numbers are what they are, Mr. Conlon...

251
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,400
- Brendan. - The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

252
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,490
I mean, you're a math teacher, right? You can appreciate that.

253
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.

254
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,670
Physics, okay.

255
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,900
But the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures.

256
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,250
And, according to these figures,

257
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,660
you're upside down on your mortgage,

258
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,410
- you understand? - God, you said that like three times.

259
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,450
I'm sorry, but I get that.

260
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,840
I am asking you, is there something else you can do?

261
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,430
Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure?

262
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,000
You refinanced twice already.

263
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,760
'Cause you advised us to do that.

264
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,220
- You told me. - Well, I presented you with that option,

265
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,600
but that was your choice.

266
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,020
I'm also showing that you

267
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,480
netted a substantial payout with the refi.

268
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,890
We had that conversation.

269
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,310
I was paying medical bills.

270
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,360
Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?

271
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,280
- Heart. - Heart. Right, sorry.

272
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,740
A lot of stories.

273
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,700
All right, so, if that's my option,

274
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,870
I have no options.

275
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,200
You're not even gonna try and help me. You're not even gonna try.

276
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,860
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,

277
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,080
I can get you 90 days to get even.

278
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,210
Ninety days is not enough.

279
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,960
My wife and I, we have three jobs between us.

280
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,670
And that doesn't cut it.

281
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,310
So, what do you suggest?

282
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,290
Well, let me ask you a question?

283
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,970
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

284
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,150
It's a viable option.

285
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,150
There's no shame in this these days.

286
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,610
That's not how I do things.

287
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,830
Okay, well, then you're looking at foreclosure.

288
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,380
Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,

289
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,670
the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.

290
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,300
The prodigy has yet to yield a single point in the entire tournament.

291
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,600
Tommy, trained by his father since the age of five.

292
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,090
Talking about Paddy Conlon?

293
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,520
The controversial Paddy Conlon.

294
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,220
Say what you will about the methods of the former Marine,

295
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,390
but he's led his son to

296
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,020
six straight Junior Olympic titles

297
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,850
and now just moments away from a High School State Championship.

298
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,110
And there it is! Wow!

299
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,110
There 's just no limit to what the future holds for this kid.

300
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,780
Tommy told me that he's chasing the record of Theogenes,

301
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,450
apparently, a mythical Greek fighter

302
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,610
said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.

303
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,790
Hi, how're you doing, sir? I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.

304
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,500
- Who? - Tommy Riordan.

305
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,460
My name is Colt Boyd.

306
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,380
What business you got with Tommy?

307
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,590
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here. I manage fighters.

308
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,600
So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,

309
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,070
and he put a beating on the

310
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,560
number one middleweight contender in the world today.

311
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,980
So, I want to know a little bit more about the guy.

312
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,980
Maybe help him out.

313
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,530
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

314
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,110
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

315
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,830
And anything you wanna know about Tommy,

316
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,620
you gotta ask him yourself.

317
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Look, I'm just asking for some general information here.

318
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,290
Like I said, anything you wanna know about Tommy,

319
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,920
you gotta ask him yourself.

320
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,670
Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night, okay?

321
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,090
He just put this address down when he signed up at the gym.

322
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,090
He doesn't live here.

323
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,420
- All right, then. - Okay. Good night.

324
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,560
All right, listen, kiddo.

325
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,690
I need you to put Mommy back on, okay?

326
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,900
I love you.

327
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,070
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in, I'm gonna have to go.

328
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,120
No, they got an open mic night thing on,

329
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,700
it's gonna be a quiet one.

330
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,250
All right, sleep well.

331
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,790
You, too. All right, bye.

332
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,920
It's about time for your next contest.

333
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,730
Introducing first, in the red corner;

334
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,350
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.

335
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,230
Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.

336
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,390
Say, "Uncle!"

337
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,980
Go, Mike. Go!

338
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,100
And his opponent in the blue corner;

339
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,150
he fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

340
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,620
Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.

341
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,210
This bout is scheduled for three, five-minute rounds,

342
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,170
and when the action begins, your referee is Mr Rick Fike.

343
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,800
Fighters to the center.

344
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,550
Come on, gentlemen.

345
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,720
I want you to obey my commands at all times.

346
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,930
I want you to protect yourselves at all times.

347
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,350
If you have no questions, touch gloves, back up.

348
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,930
And on my signal, let's come out fighting.

349
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,900
Fighter, are you ready?

350
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,320
Are you ready?

351
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,570
Do it!

352
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,000
Come on, Mike, let's go!

353
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,640
You gotta move with that one.

354
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,860
Come on, Mike!

355
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,370
Don't let him do that to you, Mike!

356
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,090
Get up, Mike, get up!

357
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,860
- First five minutes, out. - 15. Great.

358
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,900
Hey! Hey, kid!

359
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,570
Nice fight. Two more wins, you take home the bacon.

360
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,960
Hey, good job...

361
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,850
Hey, babe.

362
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,130
How was work?

363
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,210
Oh, my God!

364
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,970
What happened?

365
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,090
You said it was gonna be a slow night.

366
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,020
I'm not bouncing at a club.

367
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,150
What do you mean you're not bouncing?

368
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,340
You've been lying to me?

369
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,180
I went in to apply.

370
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,510
And they were paying nine bucks an hour.

371
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,940
Then I saw a sign

372
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,940
for this other thing.

373
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,950
They're putting us out of the house in three months.

374
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,120
We're running out of options.

375
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,870
Then they put us out of the house in three months.

376
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,700
I'd rather go back to the old apartment

377
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,880
than see you in the back of an ambulance again.

378
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,480
I thought we agreed that

379
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,040
we weren't gonna raise our children in a family

380
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,720
where their father gets beat up for a living.

381
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,220
We're not giving up the house.

382
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,130
It's our home.

383
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,100
We're not going backwards.

384
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,940
We'll figure it out.

385
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,030
This is what we're not going back to.

386
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
You wanted to talk?

387
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,690
Yeah.

388
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
I'm gonna start fighting.

389
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,110
Is that right?

390
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,230
Don't play babe in the woods with me.

391
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,650
I know that guy from the gym came to see you.

392
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,230
Colt Boyd.

393
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,450
Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.

394
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,950
I wouldn't be sitting here with you now if you did.

395
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,330
Paddy, can I get you more coffee?

396
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,330
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

397
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,490
Hon, would you like a cup of coffee?

398
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,410
Sure. Thank you.

399
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,540
All right.

400
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,720
There's this tournament,

401
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,380
it's a big tournament.

402
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,590
Top 16 middleweights in the world.

403
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,590
Single elimination. Winner takes all.

404
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,640
It's a lot of money.

405
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,100
- Okay. - I'm gonna do that.

406
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,070
But if I'm doing it,

407
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200
then I'm gonna need a trainer.

408
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,030
Now, that much, you were good at.

409
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,570
What?

410
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,710
No, no, no. This doesn't mean anything, okay?

411
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,880
I'm serious.

412
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,000
We train. That's it.

413
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,630
I don't want to hear a word about anything but training.

414
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,250
You understand?

415
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,480
You want to tell your war stories,

416
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,260
you can take them down to the VFW.

417
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,720
Or you can take it to a meeting, or to church,

418
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,220
or whatever the hell it is that you do nowadays.

419
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,020
What about Colt Boyd?

420
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,020
What about him?

421
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,600
I told him I don't train with people that I don't know.

422
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,100
- The devil you know. - Excuse me?

423
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,230
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.

424
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,900
- Yeah . - Yeah .

425
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,200
There's your coffee, hon.

426
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,120
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

427
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,650
Chasing Theogenes.

428
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,750
It'll be kind of like the old times.

429
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,500
I just told you, this doesn't mean anything.

430
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,380
Now, get that through your skull right now or I'm walking.

431
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,300
All right. All right.

432
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,010
But you get something through your skull, too.

433
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,560
You called me,

434
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,260
so don't go threatening to walk every five minutes.

435
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,440
And since this is about training,

436
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,050
you dump whatever it is

437
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,390
you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned.

438
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,400
I don't wanna see them.

439
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,610
In fact, hand them over right now.

440
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,530
I know they're on you, Tommy.

441
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,360
You sounded like a goddamn maraca coming through the door.

442
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,040
That's not gonna do.

443
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,800
When you came through that door, it was...

444
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,770
Three.

445
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,850
That'a boy.

446
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,240
And another thing. You don't eat crap like this.

447
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,490
This is for losers and old men.

448
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,240
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

449
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,570
If we're gonna do this right, you're gonna stay at the house.

450
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,330
I watch your diet. We follow the old regimen.

451
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,210
You copy?

452
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,830
All right.

453
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,680
Copy.

454
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Your brother's a liar.

455
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,600
...went in the middle of the night...

456
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,190
...and he went to a strip club, and he said he saw Mr. C...

457
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,490
No way.

458
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,570
Like MMA type stuff.

459
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,860
You weren't there, so you don't know.

460
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
What's MMA?

461
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,990
- Mixed martial arts. - Like, fighting.

462
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,450
Like, different styles of fighting.

463
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,870
He was just, like, dropped him on the floor...

464
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,250
It's true?

465
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,250
Take your seats.

466
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,680
Now, please.

467
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,940
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

468
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,430
Hey, my brother was at the titty bar last night,

469
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,570
and he said you was choking brothers out.

470
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,070
I mean, what's up, is it true?

471
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,230
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, like, is it true?

472
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,160
Did you really work on some fools or something?

473
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,160
- You have to tell us. - Yeah.

474
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,500
All right. I want examples of forms of energy.

475
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,690
Come on. It's not as bad as it looks.

476
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,730
Are you being literal or figurative?

477
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,870
Because, literally, it looks bad.

478
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,410
And figuratively, it looks even worse.

479
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,700
The superintendent's coming by. Few minutes.

480
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
Oh, man.

481
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,960
So, come on, Brendan. Give me a little help here.

482
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,460
I mean, could you explain to me what the hell you were doing?

483
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,800
I need the money, Joe.

484
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,560
Yeah, but this is...

485
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,350
We can't have this.

486
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,770
This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's, for Christ's sake.

487
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,740
Shit, Brendan.

488
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,730
Leaving everything else aside, which we can't,

489
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,660
are you out of your mind?

490
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,910
You're gonna get yourself killed.

491
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,580
I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.

492
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,160
You got no business in the ring with those animals.

493
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,750
Actually, I used to be one of those animals.

494
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,790
I fought for a living.

495
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,380
Guess I forgot to put that down on my application.

496
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,180
Yeah, I guess you did.

497
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,640
Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just...

498
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Look, look, the school district is not gonna tolerate

499
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,730
teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

500
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,440
It was a parking lot of a strip club.

501
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,900
Wherever it was, you can't be doing it. All right?

502
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,910
I mean, this is a serious... Shit, he's here.

503
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,360
This is a serious problem.

504
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,920
Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9/11.

505
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,540
What are we gonna do?

506
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,630
You say, "Yes, sir." And you say, "No, sir."

507
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,680
and you say, "It will never happen again, sir."

508
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,100
And then we just pray to God that he's in a good mood.

509
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,440
UFC?

510
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,230
Yeah.

511
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,940
Son of a bitch.

512
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,880
- Superintendent Yorn. - Principal Zito.

513
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,090
Good to see you, sir.

514
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,680
What are you doing?

515
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,100
The girls have an important piano recital in the morning.

516
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,980
And we have an equipment malfunction.

517
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,740
How'd it go?

518
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,700
They're gonna review your case at the end of the semester.

519
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,280
But until then, you're suspended without pay.

520
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,630
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

521
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,340
How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney?

522
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,590
He talked to me for free as a favor to Joe.

523
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,890
That's nice.

524
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,640
He said there's no precedent for this.

525
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,890
You'll be back by next semester.

526
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,970
The next semester?

527
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,740
Tess,

528
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,000
they have these smoker fights all over.

529
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,700
There's one in Lancaster next week,

530
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,960
there's two in Dover the week after.

531
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,170
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

532
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,010
That could keep us afloat.

533
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,260
You're gonna put yourself

534
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,310
through this over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

535
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,560
Some of them pay a lot more than that.

536
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,820
I would have to bounce for a month

537
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,450
to make what I made in two hours last night.

538
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,370
Yeah.

539
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,500
And these guys, they're not real fighters.

540
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,130
They're just guys that have seen too much UFC on TV.

541
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,670
Now, if you have a better solution,

542
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,050
I'm all ears, but...

543
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,510
And what are we gonna tell the girls?

544
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,650
It'll be fine.

545
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,320
I'll just leave the house as usual,

546
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,440
except, only this time, I'll be going to the gym.

547
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,080
The duck goes quack, quack, quack, quack.

548
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,970
And the cow goes moo, moo, moo!

549
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,210
But that rooster, that rooster, he knew everything.

550
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,730
Let's go, kiddo. Let's get moving.

551
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,270
Look what I found

552
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:00,360
in that disaster of a basement.

553
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:08,040
What do you say we sit down and update this?

554
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,580
And you can fill me in on how close you got to that record.

555
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,420
Did you continue wrestling after you left with your mother?

556
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,220
Come on, Tommy. Tell me something.

557
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,310
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

558
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:37,020
You can take that back to where you found it,

559
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,570
you can leave the coffee in the pot.

560
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,450
I can pour that myself.

561
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,990
And I can wake myself up, too.

562
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,040
Hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs.

563
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,590
Yeah?

564
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,220
I'll leave the coffee pot on until 0500, then I dump it.

565
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,310
I give command dismiss. You'll wash your nasty bodies.

566
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,110
You can square your gear away.

567
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,190
Corporal Bradford, take this to CSC,

568
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:21,900
let them know we're back.

569
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,400
Roger, sir.

570
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,610
Detail, a-ten-hut!

571
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,580
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.

572
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,580
Sitrep, over.

573
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,790
What's up, Mark?

574
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,460
Here, sir. William's Company's back in.

575
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,580
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

576
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,340
- Did you see that? Oh, my God. - What?

577
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,510
What's that?

578
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,100
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting

579
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,300
tuned up by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

580
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,850
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

581
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,390
Shit, Bradford, the stuff you don't know amazes me.

582
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,220
- Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that? - Oh, my God.

583
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,680
- Wait. Rewind that. - Okay.

584
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,690
Right there, pause, pause, pause.

585
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,280
What's up, man?

586
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,490
Dude, what's his deal?

587
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,410
You're not gonna get your 11.

588
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,120
I need to see the tape.

589
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,590
What tape?

590
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,590
- What tape? - The tape!

591
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

592
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,340
Get the camera.

593
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,540
That's him.

594
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,800
That's him.

595
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,680
Let the music sink into you. This is Beethoven.

596
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,110
I want you to breathe.

597
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,260
I don't want you boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

598
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,350
You listen to the music. You relax, you breathe.

599
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,070
Again. One, two. One, two.

600
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Good.

601
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,830
Good, good, good. Yos.

602
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,290
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it. All right?

603
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,580
Two more rounds.

604
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,960
Do I know you?

605
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,680
Oh, man!

606
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,600
Long time, brother.

607
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,970
- Too long. - Look at your place.

608
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,050
- You like? - Yeah.

609
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,940
You see this beast?

610
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,980
Marco Santos.

611
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,930
- He's training for Sparta. - Yeah, right.

612
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,390
Not bad, right?

613
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,190
It's amazing, man.

614
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,070
Only the best. Move! Move! Move!

615
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,070
Move or die!

616
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,870
- You look good, brother. - Thanks.

617
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,290
How are the girls?

618
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,210
Good. Yeah. I had another little one, Rosie.

619
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,090
I know. I know because Johnny C told me that

620
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,290
she was in the hospital for a bit.

621
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,670
- Yeah . - Yeah .

622
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,810
I was gonna call you and then time went by and...

623
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,730
I'm a piece of shit. I should've called you. I'm sorry.

624
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
- No. Come on. - No.

625
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,470
Brendan, I'm sorry.

626
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,440
It's all good. She's good now.

627
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,490
- She's okay? - So beautiful.

628
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,330
It's good to see you, man. So everything's going great, huh?

629
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,290
Well, I've got a little problem.

630
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,330
The guys at the bank want to take my house away.

631
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,170
- What? - Yeah .

632
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,760
That's kind of why I came to see you, actually.

633
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,600
You know, I got most of my dough tied up in this joint,

634
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,850
but how much do you need?

635
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,770
I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.

636
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,610
I mean, I was hoping that

637
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,070
you would train me.

638
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,860
Train you for what?

639
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,280
I wanna get back in the cage.

640
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,610
Are you serious?

641
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,370
Come on, Brendan.

642
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,290
I won an event the other night.

643
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,420
You won an event. That's what this is.

644
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,550
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?

645
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,170
DJ from a local radio station,

646
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,660
a couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare?

647
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,760
Am I right?

648
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,350
- Ish. - Ish.

649
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,810
Brendan. I love you.

650
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,310
Why am I gonna train you?

651
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,890
When you were on the right side of 30,

652
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:10,980
you were barely a 500 fighter.

653
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,060
You never listened to me.

654
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,530
You don't listen to anyone. These guys are animals.

655
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,780
You're a teacher, right?

656
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,710
What are you gonna do?

657
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,330
You're gonna come down here a couple of days a week after detention?

658
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:30,000
You're gonna skip out of the girls' volleyball game early?

659
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,000
I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue.

660
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,260
Parking lot thing kind of got me suspended.

661
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,810
I need to keep working the smokers.

662
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,270
Tess know about this?

663
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,770
Yeah?

664
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,070
'Cause the last time you fought, I got read the riot act,

665
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,030
sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that?

666
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,240
I was unconscious.

667
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,020
- You were more than unconscious. - I was.

668
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,850
She's not gonna come down

669
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:09,670
here with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

670
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,420
It's not gonna happen.

671
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,550
What do you say, Frank?

672
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,420
What do I say? What am I gonna say to you? "No"?

673
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,590
I mean, all my time is wrapped up with Marco.

674
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,720
You know, you come down, i throw you in a rotation, you spar with these guys.

675
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,400
But I can't promise you much more than that, Brendan.

676
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,850
That's all I need.

677
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,010
Great. All right.

678
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,860
- I appreciate it. - What, are you kidding me?

679
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,230
- You need anything, you call me. - I will.

680
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,660
Let me know when you're coming down.

681
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:43,020
Well, I'm just gonna get my stuff from the car.

682
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,700
Now?

683
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,850
Hey, Brendan.

684
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,230
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

685
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,070
What are you doing here?

686
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,290
I have some news for you.

687
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,210
Something wrong with your hands?

688
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,630
-No. -If there's nothing wrong with your hands,

689
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,080
there's no reason for you not to phone.

690
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,710
-That's the deal. -Yeah. I forgot.

691
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,130
The phone or mail, Pop.

692
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:39,840
Non negotiable.

693
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,970
Hey, Brendan. You ever seen my hands so steady?

694
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,640
Ever seen that?

695
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,390
I'm going inside.

696
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,810
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

697
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,310
Thousand days sober, today.

698
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:56,840
Well, that's great, Pop,

699
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,070
but it doesn't change anything.

700
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,270
What do you mean, doesn't change anything?

701
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,440
Have a heart, Brendan.

702
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,900
You listen to me.

703
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,950
You take your "Have a heart"

704
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,030
Bullshit and you run it down the road.

705
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:08,700
Yeah, run it out with someone

706
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,200
that doesn't know you like I do.

707
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,650
All right, listen to me.

708
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,630
I thought maybe we could break bread.

709
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,920
You know, just open some lines of communication.

710
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,570
You got two lines of communication.

711
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,260
You got the telephone and the post office.

712
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,760
God! Just 'cause you decide it's a special day,

713
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,010
it doesn't make it one for me.

714
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,250
I've got a wife and kids inside,

715
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,090
and they're waiting for me,

716
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,850
so I don't have time for whatever this is.

717
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,980
I know you got a wife and kid in there.

718
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,730
I've got a granddaughter in there

719
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,600
I haven't seen in three years.

720
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,430
And another one I haven't even ever met.

721
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,520
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

722
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,530
Why is that?

723
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,660
Do you remember having anything to do with that?

724
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,660
-Yeah . -Yeah .

725
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,040
That shit you pulled.

726
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,450
Never again.

727
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,000
And all that shit I saw growing up,

728
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,630
that doesn't happen here.

729
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,050
Take care of yourself.

730
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,340
Tommy's back.

731
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,650
He's in the 'Burgh.

732
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,320
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

733
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,690
Yeah, he came to see me.

734
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,010
He came to see you?

735
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,910
Yeah. He's over at the house.

736
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,960
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's.

737
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,750
You remember Fitzy's?

738
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,710
It ain't Fitzy's anymore.

739
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,750
You and Tommy are training together?

740
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,500
Yeah.

741
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,510
-Tommy Conlon? -Riordan.

742
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,320
He's using your mother's maiden name.

743
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,600
Yeah, I know what her name is.

744
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,010
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.

745
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,400
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

746
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,520
I thought you came to break bread over 1,000 days.

747
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,850
No, I did, Brendan, that's most important.

748
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,730
That, too.

749
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,280
All right. Did he say if he wants to see me?

750
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,700
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

751
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,790
He's just not that happy kid he was, you know?

752
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,050
-Wow. Look at you. -What?

753
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,300
Mr. Inside Man.

754
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,220
Inside? What?

755
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,200
You and Tommy training together

756
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,350
like nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

757
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,140
Now I know what you're really doing here.

758
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,640
-What's that? -You came to gloat.

759
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,920
I did not come to gloat.

760
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,470
I came to get my son back.

761
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,380
Wow. There you go.

762
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,730
Yeah, you got your son back.

763
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,810
No, I'm talking about you, Brendan. You.

764
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,810
You got your son back.

765
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,660
You know...

766
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,450
Forget it.

767
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,970
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part of the reason...

768
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,660
Part of the reason I stuck around,

769
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,840
'cause I thought I'd finally get you all to myself.

770
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,800
But you didn't have any interest in training me.

771
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,410
You thought Tommy was the one.

772
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,310
Brendan, I was a drunk.

773
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,430
I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.

774
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,510
Forget it.

775
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,670
You were always a frontrunner.

776
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:23,150
Never had any interest in the underdogs.

777
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,710
But I was your son.

778
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:28,530
You are my son, Brendan.

779
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,780
-Am I? -Yeah, you are.

780
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,780
I'm just asking you if you can find...

781
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,740
Find a little bit of space

782
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,950
in your heart to forgive me a little bit.

783
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:49,290
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

784
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,340
-Okay. -But I do not trust you.

785
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,040
Listen, tell Tommy,

786
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,050
if he wants to see me, this is where I am.

787
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,390
-Okay. But they're not different things. -All right?

788
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,390
You gotta trust to forgive.

789
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,480
Night, Pop.

790
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,690
My God.

791
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,980
Is that Emily?

792
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,770
Jeez, she's grown, Brendan.

793
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,650
-Is that Rosie? -Daddy, who is that?

794
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,220
It's just a nice, old man.

795
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,080
Come on. Let's go.

796
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:19,080
How about a cup of coffee?

797
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,970
Huge news just broken here at ESPN

798
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:42,140
that Koba is coming to America and will fight at Sparta-

799
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,930
Universally considered the greatest pound-for-pound fighter

800
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,590
who ever lived, the mighty, mythical Russian

801
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,060
has never fought

802
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,400
on US soil in his legendary career

803
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,700
Slow to half guard. Slow to half guard, hammer fist.

804
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,380
Now start on the other side.

805
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,990
And slip back in, there you go.

806
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,410
Tommy,

807
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,870
I got some news for you.

808
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,000
I got you into Sparta.

809
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,910
It took some doing,

810
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,050
but I made it happen.

811
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,090
You know thank you and 10% is customary?

812
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,360
Pilar? Hey, it's Tommy.

813
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,650
Tommy?

814
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,530
Okay. Sorry.

815
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,450
Como estas?

816
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:51,000
Good. I'm good. How are you doing?

817
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,260
Okay. You know me, Tommy.

818
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,760
I was getting really worried about you.

819
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,250
How's things? How are the kids?

820
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,180
The kids good?

821
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,510
Yeah, they're good.

822
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,560
-Maria 's getting so big. -Yeah?

823
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,350
She looks more and more like Manny every day.

824
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,370
How's little man?

825
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:15,860
He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

826
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,400
He's a real good boy. He takes care of his sister.

827
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,440
He's a great kid. Everyone's good.

828
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,120
Good.

829
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,040
-We're good. -Good.

830
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,700
You know...

831
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,750
Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute

832
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,960
what I promised you.

833
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,350
What I promised Manny.

834
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,430
I got opportunities coming up, so...

835
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,970
Whatever you can do, Tommy.

836
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,020
Help you guys out.

837
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,640
I'm gonna take care of you guys.

838
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,100
I know. Manny would really appreciate it.

839
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,360
I wanna help you.

840
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,730
You know what? You worry too much.

841
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,980
You worry so much about us. It's okay.

842
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,360
You know what? We're hanging in there.

843
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,770
Captain Pollard once more

844
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:01,320
sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship,

845
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,980
But the gods shipwrecked

846
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,620
him again upon unknown rocks and breakers.

847
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,950
For the second time, his ship was utterly lost,

848
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,780
And forthwith forswearing the sea,

849
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,380
he has never tempted it since.

850
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,790
Stop for a second. Listen to the music.

851
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,340
This is Beethoven.

852
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,950
Could you do another thing?

853
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,510
Or are you gonna do the same thing?

854
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,250
I need you to relax and listen.

855
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,140
Forget about how to lose the fight.

856
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,260
And two, and three.

857
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,970
With eight weeks left to Sparta,

858
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,850
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew

859
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,880
take time out from their international press tour

860
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,850
to join us.

861
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,610
J. J., we've never seen this kind of Grand Prix tournament

862
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,440
in this country before.

863
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,690
Tell us, why the unique format?

864
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,390
Well, look, Jon, you know

865
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,700
as well as anyone that in mixed martial arts,

866
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,990
anyone can beat anyone on a given night.

867
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,820
But with this type of format,

868
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,540
it's gonna be tough to deny who the champion is.

869
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,560
You got four fights in two nights,

870
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,590
16 fighters down to one,

871
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,380
winner's gonna be the last man standing.

872
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,420
Thirty-one. Thirty-two!

873
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,090
Breathe, breathe. Keep your eyes open.

874
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,590
You gotta keep moving.

875
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:04,880
You gotta keep moving. Keep moving.

876
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,450
Good! And listen to the music.

877
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,720
You breathe. He's getting it. He's getting it.

878
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,850
You see? You feel it?

879
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,390
Feel the music.

880
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,520
-Come on! -Nice.

881
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,520
Come on, baby!

882
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,060
With Rashad Evans and Stephan Bonnar

883
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,100
and just five weeks left until Sparta,

884
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,900
as the hype continues

885
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,820
for the war on the shore this Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City.

886
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,200
You know what that means.

887
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,030
The great Koba bringing his act stateside.

888
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,910
But I gotta ask you about the other guys.

889
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,020
What are they thinking,

890
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,960
entering a winner-take-all tournament

891
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,660
against a guy that seemingly can't be beaten?

892
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,330
They're thinking $5 million

893
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,460
and $5 million seems a lot of money,

894
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,630
but they gotta remember one thing.

895
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,090
They're going against Koba.

896
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,540
Mission impossible, game over; go home.

897
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,300
Well, the winner takes home $5 million.

898
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,050
You can be sure this will dominate the sports landscape

899
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,010
Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City.

900
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:54,140
The great Koba making his presence felt in the United States.

901
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,690
Come on, Tommy.

902
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,980
Hits you soft, right? Flow like water.

903
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,900
Get on your arm, watch what's gonna happen.

904
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:03,150
There it is. Look, look, look. He's going to sleep.

905
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,730
You train with the best to be the best, Brendan.

906
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,780
Pittsburgh Beatdown has become one of the most watched videos

907
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,580
on YouTube this year

908
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,110
Now joining us, via satellite,

909
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,000
is the victim of the infamous incident,

910
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,170
Mad Dog Grimes.

911
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,430
Mad Dog, what is your response

912
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:23,130
to all the hoopla surrounding the video

913
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,300
and Tommy Riordan?

914
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,450
This guy's a nobody.

915
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,930
It's a sparring session.

916
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,940
It is what it is,

917
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,510
and he's gonna pay for it next month

918
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,010
in Atlantic City.

919
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,350
Good. Always move. Always move.

920
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:35,660
I don't know, Marco.

921
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,850
You're getting a good game here from a physics teacher.

922
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,060
Good! Good.

923
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,900
You see? You see? Beautiful.

924
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,230
Top of the food chain. He's the next champ, right here.

925
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,410
So, with Sparta now just two short weeks away,

926
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:59,340
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew return to the US

927
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,010
after a world tour that saw

928
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,920
them visit 10 fighters in 10 different countries.

929
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,110
They stopped in Philadelphia

930
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,630
today to check in on renowned trainer;

931
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:07,840
Frank Campana,

932
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,670
and top contender; Marco Santos.

933
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,180
You gotta relax and stay calm in there.

934
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,140
The cage is your home.

935
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,640
You set the pace.

936
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,390
You set the rhythm.

937
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,480
Feel the Beethoven.

938
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,500
Be smarter than him, more patient.

939
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,280
Wait for him to make a mistake.

940
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,190
And when he does, that's your moment.

941
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,020
I see it. I see it. I see it.

942
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,450
No, he did not tap you!

943
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,290
Physics teacher! That's the best in the business, son.

944
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:39,710
You can do this, Son!

945
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,540
Smoother There's more in you! You got more in you!

946
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,710
We're not done yet!

947
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,630
He's beating you! He's beating you!

948
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,790
You better push harden Marco!

949
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,680
Brendan 's running away!

950
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,730
And the winner by tap out

951
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,650
"Irish" Brendan Conlon.

952
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,510
"...To each and every man in

953
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:08,240
turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self

954
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,180
"Great pains, small gains

955
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,320
for those who ask the world to solve them.

956
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,950
It cannot solve itself "

957
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,350
-Are you gonna be okay? -Yeah.

958
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,340
You wanna grab a bite?

959
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,770
No. I'm gonna head home.

960
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,600
I gotta call the boys and break the news.

961
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,350
I'll call you tomorrow.

962
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,350
Okay.

963
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,610
Coach!

964
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,500
Hey, I know this is not a really great time,

965
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,750
and it's too bad about Marco.

966
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,180
But how about me?

967
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,790
Are you talking about Sparta?

968
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,470
Yeah.

969
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,140
Brendan, you've got a better shot at starting a boy band.

970
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,220
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

971
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,110
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

972
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,770
Which means anything could happen.

973
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,940
You know that as well as I do.

974
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,530
Yeah.

975
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,370
Come on. They'd have to kill me to get me out of the cage.

976
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,280
That's what I'm afraid of.

977
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,870
Frank, I need this.

978
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,040
You're real tight with these guys.

979
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,920
You could call them.

980
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,840
You're the guy. They trust you.

981
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,840
Brendan.

982
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,890
You realize what you're asking me to do here?

983
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,470
Yeah.

984
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:03,920
We go down to AC,

985
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,690
you get tapped out in five seconds.

986
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,560
How does that benefit either one of us?

987
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,860
-It's not gonna happen. -Not gonna happen?

988
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,900
Wish I had a nickel for every time somebody told me that.

989
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,200
It's not gonna happen.

990
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,120
I'll make a call.

991
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,270
I love my coach!

992
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,030
Yeah, they're good.

993
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,110
The girls are good. They're good.

994
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,280
Yeah, he should.

995
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,100
I mean, you've been

996
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,910
spending so much time with Brendan these days,

997
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,030
it's like you're part of the family or something.

998
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,750
Yeah, he's right here. It's your boyfriend.

999
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,420
Frank. Hey, man.

1000
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,760
That's unbelievable.

1001
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,380
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thank you enough.

1002
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,850
I don't know what to say.

1003
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,610
All right, listen, I gotta call you back, okay?

1004
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,490
All right. Bye.

1005
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,360
I'm in.

1006
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,610
I'm going.

1007
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:44,740
Really?

1008
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,370
That's your decision? You decided?

1009
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,630
'Cause I really enjoyed the conversation we just had

1010
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,710
about making that decision together.

1011
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,180
You told me you were gonna fight guys

1012
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,180
that watched too much UFC.

1013
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,480
I saw the Koba dude on the television,

1014
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,480
and he's the guy they're watching.

1015
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:10,520
It's a lot of money, Tess.

1016
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,850
I don't give a shit about the money, Brendan.

1017
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:13,100
I told you that.

1018
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,350
We're gonna end up cashing in your life insurance policy

1019
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,900
before we pick up that prize money.

1020
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:20,820
You don't think I can do it, right?

1021
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,910
I think you could get killed.

1022
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:27,950
I'm not gonna get killed.

1023
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,000
You're not gonna get killed,

1024
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,500
but you promised me you're not gonna get hurt.

1025
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,980
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.

1026
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,170
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

1027
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,790
We have no prize money, we have no house.

1028
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,400
We have payments for hospital bills.

1029
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,920
Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

1030
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,040
If I don't try in three weeks,

1031
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,510
they're gonna take the house.

1032
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:47,140
How's that for a promise?

1033
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,020
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

1034
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,350
But I'd really love it if you'd be with me on this.

1035
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,870
I'm not gonna watch you fight again, I'm not.

1036
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:09,370
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

1037
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:40,360
Fourth of July weekend

1038
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,730
doesn't officially get started until tomorrow,

1039
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:45,280
but fight fans are already descending on Atlantic City

1040
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,200
for the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts, Sparta!

1041
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,770
We've got the dancing girls,

1042
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,080
we've got the paparazzi,

1043
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,580
we've got the red carpet!

1044
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,890
And here comes J.J. Riley,

1045
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,160
the man who started it all.

1046
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,090
J.J., you've made a fortune with your hedge funds.

1047
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,880
You turned your back on Wall Street

1048
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,300
and dedicated your life to making Sparta happen.

1049
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,630
Tell us why this tournament is so important to you?

1050
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,840
Growing up, we all wanted to know

1051
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,140
who the toughest kid in the neighborhood was, right?

1052
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,060
I wanna know who the toughest man on the planet is.

1053
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,850
And that's why I put this thing together

1054
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:15,830
That's what all these

1055
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,730
people are here to see, come Saturday night.

1056
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:20,150
-That's what we're gonna find out. -Thank you, J.J.

1057
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,750
And here 's something

1058
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,950
fans never thought they'd see. Koba is here.

1059
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,450
The legend arriving to fiight on US soil for the very first time.

1060
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:29,530
Koba! Koba!

1061
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:30,510
Olympic gold medalist in wrestling,

1062
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,580
world Sambo champion,

1063
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,460
undefeated in his mixed martial arts career.

1064
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:38,630
Nobody's survived a round with the Russian in five years.

1065
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,210
He is the greatest fighter.

1066
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:54,020
I mean, you've seen our logos.

1067
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,350
No, yeah, I've seen your stuff. It looks good.

1068
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,880
I mean, is he fighting after Sparta?

1069
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,050
I mean, we're trying to find some info on him.

1070
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,630
No, I'm not sure.

1071
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,710
Hey, Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

1072
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,500
You can't leave me like that. They want to talk to you, not me.

1073
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,710
- Frank Campana? - Yeah.

1074
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,510
Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

1075
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,380
- Julia, how are you? - Brendan Conlon?

1076
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:44,030
Yeah, hi. Hey.

1077
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:45,300
Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

1078
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,590
- Right, hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1079
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:47,890
A few things I want to let you guys know.

1080
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,890
- Press conference will start in 20 minutes. - Okay.

1081
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,140
Brendan, you're gonna be sitting up on the stage.

1082
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,520
Tommy!

1083
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,730
Hey, Tommy! Where you going?

1084
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,720
Can we stand with J.J.?

1085
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:01,390
Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat,

1086
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,450
The whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay.

1087
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,810
But in that evolution,

1088
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:09,780
catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship,

1089
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:13,620
Seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions,

1090
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:17,830
Bethinking it, it may be a larger and nobler foe.

1091
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:21,540
Of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing prow,

1092
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:25,550
Smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

1093
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,100
Ahab staggered, his hand smote his forehead.

1094
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,920
"I grow blind... "

1095
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,760
Now, the only person missing from the event

1096
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,340
was dark horse entry, Tommy Riordan.

1097
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:36,770
Recent revelations that

1098
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,350
Riordan was not only a United States Marine,

1099
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:43,310
but a hero in the Iraq Wan has cast an even wider spotlight

1100
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,990
on a fighter who seems to have come out of nowhere.

1101
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:49,160
Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's Web testimony to Riordan,

1102
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:51,700
who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq,

1103
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,750
is now spreading like wildfire throughout the media.

1104
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,950
Tommy!

1105
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:57,530
And the bridge just crumbled.

1106
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,370
Tommy, come here. Come on. You got to see this.

1107
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,970
The amtrac was upside down

1108
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:05,210
and water was coming in from everywhere.

1109
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:07,940
And the water pressure was too much.

1110
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,340
We couldn't get the back hatch open.

1111
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,600
We were all drowning, man.

1112
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,220
It was a death trap.

1113
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:16,060
I couldn't have had more than another minute.

1114
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,100
Then suddenly, the back ramp gets ripped off

1115
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,850
There he was.

1116
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:27,820
And before I could get out and thank him, he was gone.

1117
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,780
- He just vanished like a ghost. - Tommy?

1118
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,960
Tommy, did you... Where you going?

1119
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,110
Taking a walk.

1120
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:36,660
Tommy!

1121
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:39,960
I really just wanted to say thank you.

1122
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,250
You saved my life, brother

1123
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:47,420
And anyone seeing this at Sparta,

1124
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,760
anybody out in Pittsburgh,

1125
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,540
you reach out to Tommy Riordan

1126
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,710
and tell him Mark said, "Thank you."

1127
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,720
Footage taken from a helmet cam on the ground in Iraq

1128
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,180
captured the heroic incident.

1129
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,560
Hello?

1130
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,140
Brendan?

1131
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,650
Been looking all over for you.

1132
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:49,240
How's it going?

1133
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,030
It's going.

1134
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,280
I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.

1135
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:00,700
I don't drink coffee, man. What do you want?

1136
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,840
You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?

1137
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,960
I'm good right here.

1138
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,180
Okay.

1139
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:19,300
Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed

1140
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,730
to know I was never gonna see you guys again?

1141
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,180
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

1142
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,520
You had the information.

1143
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,730
You chose the old man and the girl.

1144
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,860
She wasn't just some girl.

1145
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,240
I married her.

1146
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,070
She's my wife.

1147
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,330
See?

1148
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,830
That's Tess.

1149
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:50,290
That's Emily and Rosie.

1150
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:52,500
They're your nieces, Tommy.

1151
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,210
I don't know them.

1152
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:58,140
I know you don't know them. Of course you don't know them.

1153
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,770
So why am I looking at pictures of people I don't know?

1154
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,850
'Cause that's my family.

1155
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,850
And who are you exactly?

1156
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,280
I'm your brother, man.

1157
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:19,990
You were in the Corps?

1158
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,950
What?

1159
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,150
I said I didn't Know you were in the Corps.

1160
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,280
I wasn't in the Corps.

1161
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:28,710
Then you ain't no brother to me.

1162
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,300
My brother was in the Corps.

1163
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,550
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1164
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:37,090
I was a 16-year-old kid. What the hell did I know?

1165
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,590
I don't know what you know.

1166
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,300
Why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it?

1167
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,970
She's my wife, Tommy.

1168
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,670
So, that's it? I stay with Tess,

1169
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,340
I never get to see you guys again?

1170
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:47,810
Not a single phone call? Nothing?

1171
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:51,810
God, man, I don't understand this.

1172
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,980
What? You...

1173
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,740
So, you won't forgive me, but you forgave Pop?

1174
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,270
No, he's just some old vet that I train with,

1175
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,070
you know? He means nothing to me.

1176
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,500
And what I hear, he means nothing to you, either.

1177
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:13,210
You got balls talking about forgiveness.

1178
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,040
That has nothing to do with forgiveness.

1179
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,920
I got children, man. I got a family to protect.

1180
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Everything I do is for them.

1181
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,550
I forgave Pop.

1182
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:24,470
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1183
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:33,350
You forgave us?

1184
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,570
Yeah.

1185
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,660
Well, I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan.

1186
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:41,830
You got some stones, man.

1187
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,490
I fell in love. What the hell was I supposed to do?

1188
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:46,020
You were supposed to stick to the plan.

1189
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,290
You were supposed to come with us.

1190
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,840
Mom needed you, I needed you.

1191
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,870
You're my big brother. You bailed on me.

1192
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,830
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.

1193
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:54,800
Everything worked out for you.

1194
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:55,920
God.

1195
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,630
You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?

1196
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,380
You leave, you get to bury people.

1197
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,390
You're not the only one that suffered, Tommy.

1198
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,600
I didn't even know she was sick.

1199
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:14,730
I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother.

1200
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:19,580
You had no right to keep that from me.

1201
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,280
That was not your decision to make!

1202
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,740
You know what?

1203
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:29,240
You walk around with your pictures of your wife,

1204
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,620
and you're all, "I forgive you.

1205
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,250
"I forgive Pop.

1206
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:36,500
"I forgive everyone."

1207
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,080
Brendan, you know,

1208
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,590
you're full of shit.

1209
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,390
Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?

1210
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:12,920
You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel

1211
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:15,120
while school's actually in session, right?

1212
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,130
- Yes, Principal Z. - Tell him.

1213
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,500
Okay, we wanna use the auditorium this weekend

1214
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,550
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1215
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,300
What do you say?

1216
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,050
So, you want to use the auditorium

1217
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:26,450
to watch a suspended teacher

1218
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:28,760
engage in the activity that he was suspended for?

1219
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,090
- Right. - Am I hearing this correct?

1220
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,050
Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,

1221
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:33,980
so it could turn into a fundraiser, you know?

1222
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:36,100
You know, I think you need to talk to your parents,

1223
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,310
because you guys might need to be in summer school.

1224
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:39,810
- Everybody wants this. - Come on, Mr. Zito.

1225
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:41,400
We've been telling everybody about it already.

1226
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:42,480
- Exactly. - And the gym's the only place

1227
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,760
that's big enough to fit everyone.

1228
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,860
Look, it's never gonna happen.

1229
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,110
What if we get a petition signed?

1230
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:47,440
We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1231
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:49,400
- The power of democracy. - What are they gonna do about that?

1232
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:50,450
Mr. Z, please?

1233
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:51,780
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate

1234
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:53,580
the fact that you love your teacher, I really do,

1235
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,710
but there is nothing I can do for you.

1236
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:34,330
The roof is about to blow clean off Boardwalk Hall Arena.

1237
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:36,680
It might be Fourth of July weekend,

1238
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,330
but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.

1239
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:43,630
This is Atlantic City. This is the War on the Shore,

1240
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:46,630
and this is what everyone's been waiting for

1241
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,580
Sixteen of the baddest men on

1242
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:51,560
the planet duking it out over a 24-hour period

1243
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:55,060
for the largest purse in mixed martial arts history.

1244
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,140
In the town everyone knows from the game of Monopoly,

1245
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:01,270
we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair

1246
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:04,230
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,

1247
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:06,650
and take a ride on the Reading.

1248
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,860
Sparta is here!

1249
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:11,950
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1250
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:14,780
along with bestselling fight author, Sam Sheridan.

1251
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,950
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,

1252
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,910
he wanted to create, quite simply,

1253
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:23,920
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle in history.

1254
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,210
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1255
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:29,720
J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is

1256
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,220
and put up the biggest purse the sport has ever seen.

1257
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,100
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1258
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:39,520
As is the hoopla surrounding one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1259
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,020
who has become an overnight sensation

1260
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,100
and captured the imagination and attention...

1261
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,950
...Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,

1262
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,280
who has a 19 to four record in his mixed martial arts' career

1263
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,120
Our rules of the cage are brought to you by Tapout.

1264
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,830
- Five minutes, Paddy. - Okay.

1265
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:07,470
It looks as though the moment of truth has arrived,

1266
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,260
because here comes Tommy Riordan.

1267
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,550
Tommy Riordan 's captured the media 's attention,

1268
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:14,600
but the question still remains.

1269
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,050
Who is this guy?

1270
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,600
And more importantly,

1271
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,600
can he compete in this talent pool? Can he win?

1272
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,430
I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.

1273
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:26,240
And I say the fact that I don't know is very strange.

1274
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:28,480
In an Internet age where there are no secrets,

1275
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,440
this guy's a complete mystery.

1276
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,490
I can't find out anything about him.

1277
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:35,650
Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.

1278
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:40,320
Get your hands off me.

1279
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:42,660
Okay, let's go.

1280
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:44,040
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1281
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:47,000
No walk-out music, no sponsors, no interviews.

1282
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,970
He skipped the press conference,

1283
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,420
wouldn't have his picture taken for the program.

1284
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,250
He's breaking every rule.

1285
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,590
The only reason, really, that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament

1286
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:58,190
is an MMA video making the

1287
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,180
rounds of him beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1288
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,980
But the reason that a lot of his fans are in the stands

1289
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,650
is because of another video.

1290
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,400
It's even more stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1291
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,230
This guy... Let me describe it to you, folks,

1292
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:11,430
for the few that haven't seen it,

1293
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,610
and I don't know anybody who hasn't,

1294
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:16,240
but Tommy Riordan ripped the door off a tank

1295
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,290
in the heat of battle, saving lives in the process,

1296
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,330
and then walked away without claiming a medal.

1297
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,750
- Listen... - He ripped the door off a tank.

1298
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:24,700
Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.

1299
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,790
I'm not taking anything away from the guy,

1300
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:28,130
he's a very, very tough guy,

1301
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,340
but the tank don't hit back, you know.

1302
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:30,880
Sam...

1303
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,380
We've seen YouTube sensations fail on a big stage before.

1304
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,930
Sam, he ripped the door off a tank!

1305
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,510
Tommy Riordan, he has definitely got his hands full

1306
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,100
in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.

1307
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,650
- Francisco Barbosa... - He's nothing to scoff at.

1308
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,440
Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.

1309
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,690
He's a very, very tough guy, a very high-caliber fighter.

1310
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,440
Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,

1311
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,900
and I 'd imagine he's gonna disappear just as quickly.

1312
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,980
It's a great story,

1313
01:17:57,070 --> 01:18:00,120
but I think your boy is gonna be exposed here

1314
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,660
as a YouTube sensation.

1315
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:04,870
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall hope you're wrong, Sam.

1316
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,130
All right, gentlemen, you've been given your instructions.

1317
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,750
I expect a clean fight.

1318
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:10,170
Obey my command at all times,

1319
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,540
defend yourselves at all times.

1320
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:13,420
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1321
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,050
Tommy, cut off the corners, feel this guy out,

1322
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,600
just like we know. Just like we know.

1323
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:22,550
We're about to get the big answer to the big question.

1324
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,850
Is Tommy Riordan for real?

1325
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:26,240
Gentlemen, you ready?

1326
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,150
They are both game fighters.

1327
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:28,970
- And here we go. - You ready?

1328
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,190
Let's go to war!

1329
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,860
Keep your focus, Tom.

1330
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,690
And here we go. We're gonna see this.

1331
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:35,150
Barbosa's gonna be looking for a takedown.

1332
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:37,280
He's definitely looking for a takedown here.

1333
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,120
Barbosa is down! Barbosa has been knocked out!

1334
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,370
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.

1335
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:52,050
And now he's walking out of the cage. He's leaving the cage.

1336
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,670
Hey, Tommy!

1337
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,840
There goes another rule, out the window!

1338
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:57,970
Where you going?

1339
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:01,090
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1340
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:03,850
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan.

1341
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,690
A huge left hook, launching...

1342
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:06,760
Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1343
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:08,300
-... Tommy Riordan into the second round.

1344
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,720
One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1345
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:12,360
Good. Two, three.

1346
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:14,110
Good. Good, good, good.

1347
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:15,380
- Good. Come on. Good. One, two.

1348
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,060
Tommy Riordan is the real deal.

1349
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,240
- Showtime. - All right. Come on, give me eight.

1350
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,910
Yes! That's my boy.

1351
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,540
Let's go, move your head around.

1352
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,500
You ready?

1353
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,710
Look at me.

1354
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:29,310
You can do this.

1355
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:37,690
I wanna hear you say it.

1356
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:44,320
I can do this.

1357
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:46,820
Let's go do this.

1358
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,470
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,

1359
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:07,770
less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1360
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,720
And basically, he had to go on the road to Frank Campana.

1361
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,900
Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,

1362
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,720
which is really something I don't understand.

1363
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:16,770
I just... I'm shocked.

1364
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,900
Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.

1365
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:28,280
Go. Good luck.

1366
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,040
Let's go, Brendan.

1367
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:33,750
You go get him, Son!

1368
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:35,920
You know, I can understand coming out to no music,

1369
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,310
but why in the world would

1370
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,540
you choose classical music as your entrance?

1371
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,420
This is Beethoven. This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.

1372
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,470
My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.

1373
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,680
Go get him, Son.

1374
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,670
If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,

1375
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:51,350
you gotta talk about Frank Campana.

1376
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:52,550
Very unorthodox trainer,

1377
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,480
but one of the best trainers in the game,

1378
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,220
and he's well known for using

1379
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,810
classical music to teach his fighters to remain calm,

1380
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:02,320
to remain patient, and to remain composed under pressure.

1381
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,560
You know, I'll tell you,

1382
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,030
classical music is about as fitting to this setting

1383
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:08,830
as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.

1384
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,330
- Come on. - In fact, let me show you something.

1385
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,400
Right here. Let me tell you...

1386
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:12,910
- What? - You see that, right there?

1387
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:16,840
That, right there... That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1388
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,790
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about to be dropped into a shark tank.

1389
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:22,120
He's a feeder fish.

1390
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:23,710
Come on, give the guy a break.

1391
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:26,140
You know, the guy... At least we've seen him fight.

1392
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:28,680
I mean, he's fought real guys. He's been in the UFC.

1393
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,720
- We remember him from that. - I remember him, too.

1394
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,850
I remember him being very unmemorable.

1395
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:56,170
Midnight Le getting ready to climb into the cage and go to work.

1396
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,290
When the brackets were announced,

1397
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:59,210
he thought he'd be going up against Marco Santos.

1398
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:00,300
He's got to be thrilled

1399
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,260
to be seeing Brendan Conlon across from him.

1400
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:04,420
Hey! You asked for it.

1401
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:07,800
Brendan retired from fighting some years ago.

1402
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,470
He's actually a high school physics teacher now,

1403
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,610
and Midnight had some fun

1404
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:13,470
with that at the press conference yesterday.

1405
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:16,220
Well, he said he was going to give the teacher a serious lesson,

1406
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,650
and that getting killed was no way to spend a summer vacation.

1407
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,610
Midnight is known for talking trash,

1408
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,400
he's also known for backing it up.

1409
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,560
No question, Bryan.

1410
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,440
He's in a lot of trouble here.

1411
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,130
Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.

1412
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:29,150
Gentlemen.

1413
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,150
Go get him.

1414
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,910
All right, guys, you've been given your instructions.

1415
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:39,410
I expect a clean fight.

1416
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,660
Obey my commands at all times.

1417
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:43,000
Defend yourselves at all times.

1418
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,250
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1419
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:48,590
Go have some fun, baby.

1420
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,090
Gentlemen, you ready?

1421
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,770
You ready? Let's go to war!

1422
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:05,110
Work your kicks!

1423
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:09,650
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1424
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,610
Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.

1425
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,190
Let it out! Come on, move!

1426
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,080
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1427
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,580
In and out!

1428
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,460
Get off the fence!

1429
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,970
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1430
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:36,520
Get off the fence! Get off the fence!

1431
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:39,390
There he goes!

1432
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:40,810
Come on, Brendan. Get out of there!

1433
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:42,730
Come on!

1434
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,690
Get up!

1435
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,310
- Come on! Come on! - Watch the back of the head!

1436
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,530
Relax, you're okay. You're okay!

1437
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:50,570
Midnight is all over Brendan.

1438
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:51,740
Well, this can't last much longer.

1439
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,150
This won't last much longer.

1440
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:55,660
The teacher just has no answers.

1441
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,740
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1442
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,540
- And now, he's got the hooks in. - The hooks are in.

1443
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,660
- Brendan in very big trouble. - The end is close.

1444
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:05,660
Can Brendan make the end of the round?

1445
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,580
Well, he's got the choke.

1446
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,260
- He's got 20 seconds left in the round... - Come on.

1447
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:11,190
And Conlon's face is turning purple.

1448
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,430
This looks like it's over.

1449
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,800
Get up! Find his legs!

1450
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,760
Hips! Hip down!

1451
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,220
Hip down! Get your weight down!

1452
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,770
Get your weight down!

1453
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,610
Well, Midnight is squeezing with all his might.

1454
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:23,310
He's got it very deep.

1455
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,160
Ten seconds! Don't you tap!

1456
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,980
Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.

1457
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,230
Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!

1458
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:29,770
Hold on, Brendan.

1459
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:31,350
Conlon doing his best to hang on,

1460
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,410
'cause his whole world's about to go from day to night.

1461
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,730
Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!

1462
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:41,030
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1463
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,290
I thought for sure this guy was going to sleep.

1464
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:47,920
Midnight can't believe it either, by the way.

1465
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:50,420
Jesus.

1466
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,840
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1467
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,800
You should've had him in the first round.

1468
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:01,710
Beautiful. Beautiful.

1469
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:04,050
He doesn't know what hit him.

1470
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,980
He doesn't know what hit him. Breathe.

1471
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,730
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1472
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:10,190
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1473
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,370
Deep breath, deep breath.

1474
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:12,610
I want you to do something.

1475
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,400
I want you to get him to pull, okay?

1476
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,030
When he pulls,

1477
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:18,230
I want you to hit him a bit and I want you to shoot on him.

1478
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,800
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,

1479
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,410
listening to Frank Campana right now

1480
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:22,530
and hear what he's saying in there.

1481
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,290
In and out. In and out. In and out.

1482
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:26,100
And I want you to trade punches with him, all right?

1483
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:27,370
You're doing beautiful.

1484
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,330
Let's go, seconds out!

1485
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:31,630
Knock him out. Knock him out. Knock him out.

1486
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:32,830
This round, knock him out.

1487
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,010
- Let's do it. - He doesn't deserve to be here.

1488
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,050
Beautiful. Breathe.

1489
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,430
Let's go!

1490
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:41,730
And here we go.

1491
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:44,140
The teacher answering the bell for round two.

1492
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:45,310
Nice and easy!

1493
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,350
Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!

1494
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:50,430
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1495
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:09,040
Circle around! Circle around!

1496
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,750
Nice and easy!

1497
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,290
Good, good!

1498
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,370
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1499
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:22,050
Get out of there! Hitch him! Hitch him! Hitch him!

1500
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:25,850
Get out of there! Get out of there! Get out of there! Come on!

1501
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,310
Do something.

1502
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:33,230
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1503
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:35,020
Shoot on him!

1504
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:38,860
Yes!

1505
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:41,030
Conlon shoots on Midnight Le and gets him down.

1506
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:42,610
Midnight is trying to get to his...

1507
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,660
- Scissors takedown. - A beautiful scissors takedown.

1508
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:46,030
Really nice.

1509
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,620
Conlon showing signs of life

1510
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,500
and not backing down.

1511
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:50,790
Knees, knees!

1512
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:55,420
Good!

1513
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,630
Take his arm! Good!

1514
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:01,590
- He's got a kimura lock! - He's got a very good Kimura.

1515
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:05,020
Turn your hips in! In!

1516
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:08,060
Up! Stay with him. Turn your hips in!

1517
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:11,940
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1518
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:13,310
Turn your hips in!

1519
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:16,030
You got it, Brendan. Your round. You got it!

1520
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:18,270
Turn your hips up and in!

1521
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,450
Hips up! Very good!

1522
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:22,120
He's in a lot of trouble.

1523
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:24,030
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1524
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:25,440
Wow! He's got it very, very deep.

1525
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,080
Midnight is in a very, very bad position.

1526
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:28,250
Midnight is in big trouble.

1527
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,290
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1528
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:32,990
Brendan Conlon is going to finish it right here!

1529
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,920
Brendan Conlon has got him in a very, very dangerous position

1530
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,830
and Midnight is in big trouble.

1531
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:36,670
Midnight...

1532
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:38,220
I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.

1533
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:40,380
You got it! You got it!

1534
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:43,970
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1535
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,600
And this isn't... This isn't happening!

1536
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,550
- This can't happen. - It just did, Bryan.

1537
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:50,800
He tapped!

1538
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,940
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1539
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:55,480
- I can't believe that. - Oh, my goodness!

1540
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:58,280
You got him! Way to go, Brendan!

1541
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,610
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1542
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,240
Honey, he tapped him out!

1543
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,750
He did it! He did it!

1544
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:09,460
He did it! He did it!

1545
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:12,160
Way to go, Brendan! Way to go! Yeah!

1546
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:15,040
This is what's so great about mixed martial arts.

1547
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,870
There's so many ways to lose.

1548
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:21,300
One tiny miscalculation, anyone can win at anytime.

1549
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:23,800
Which is probably why Frank Campana's embracing his man.

1550
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,520
And I honestly don't think

1551
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,680
either one of them can believe what just happened.

1552
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,230
Great show of sportsmanship here from the teacher.

1553
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:33,980
Well, that's a hallmark of Frank Campana's philosophy,

1554
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:35,680
something all his fighters buy into,

1555
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,730
and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.

1556
01:29:37,810 --> 01:29:39,530
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1557
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,600
He thought he'd get a free pass into the second round,

1558
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:42,980
but, instead, he's going home.

1559
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:44,910
Dominated the fight the entire way,

1560
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:47,290
but he falls prey to a very technical finish.

1561
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,410
A very technical finish, but that's a fluke.

1562
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:50,900
I don't care what anybody says. That is a...

1563
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:51,460
I don't know.

1564
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:52,470
You can call it a fluke,

1565
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,370
but I'm gonna call it a guy maintaining composure

1566
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,290
and waiting for his opportunity.

1567
01:29:57,290 --> 01:30:00,540
Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!

1568
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:04,170
I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.

1569
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:28,280
Yes!

1570
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,150
Okay.

1571
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,110
We 're down to eight fighters,

1572
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,250
and soon to be seven,

1573
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:48,130
as Koba prepares to go to work for the second time tonight.

1574
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:54,760
- Right hand. - Huge right hand.

1575
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,220
- Huge right hand. - Oh, my goodness.

1576
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:58,650
Oh, my God! This is over.

1577
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,650
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

1578
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:01,920
You got to be kidding me.

1579
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,610
I'm afraid he might have broken something else.

1580
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,060
That's certainly possible.

1581
01:31:05,190 --> 01:31:07,610
Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

1582
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:09,690
- Koba! Koba! - Koba! Koba!

1583
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:13,450
Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.

1584
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:15,280
Like a man with something to prove,

1585
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,880
reminding everyone why he is

1586
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,370
a serious contender to win this whole contest.

1587
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:22,090
He wanted to send a message to Tommy Riordan,

1588
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:23,710
and there it is, right there.

1589
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:26,460
Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.

1590
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:28,970
The teacher miraculously passed his first test,

1591
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,550
but now he's got to face the Dane.

1592
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:33,180
Brendan! You can do it.

1593
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:38,770
Halfway through round three, now, and the beating continues.

1594
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:40,230
I honestly don't know how

1595
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:42,900
Brendan Conlon can take this kind of punishment.

1596
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,900
He has been battered without mercy

1597
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:45,530
in both of his fights today.

1598
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:46,450
Relax! You're okay!

1599
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,190
He's still standing, Bryan.

1600
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:51,360
Beethoven!

1601
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,040
No! No, no, no!

1602
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:56,320
Good, take him down!

1603
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,330
Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!

1604
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,460
Hold on to him.

1605
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:03,170
He's looking for that arm. He's looking for the armbar.

1606
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:05,090
- He's got an armbar. - He's got that armbar.

1607
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,960
He's looking to be boss of it, once again.

1608
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,740
Tap, tap, tap!

1609
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:08,590
Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1610
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,930
Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!

1611
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,100
He's got that arm, Sam!

1612
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,680
- Break, break, break, break! - Yes!

1613
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:17,810
Are you kidding me?

1614
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,680
Yes!

1615
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,510
Do it once, it's a fluke.

1616
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:22,140
Do it twice, and it's something else.

1617
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:25,520
Pull the bandwagon over, I think I am hopping on.

1618
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:27,190
I think I'm a believer.

1619
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,110
You did it! Way to go, Brendan!

1620
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:31,820
- I'm doing this! - Okay.

1621
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,120
- I'm doing it! - Okay.

1622
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,410
Okay, Son.

1623
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:38,070
The crowd catching fire for the hero Tommy Riordan.

1624
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,370
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

1625
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:44,080
He doesn't seem to want anything to do with all this adulation.

1626
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,880
He's just here to fight.

1627
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,420
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

1628
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,970
Gentlemen, you ready?

1629
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,050
Are you ready?

1630
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,350
- Let's go to war! - Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1631
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:57,550
Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!

1632
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:03,390
- Yeah. - He is all over Diego Santana.

1633
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:06,890
He's swarming all over him,

1634
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:08,650
and now he's beating on him without mercy!

1635
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:09,770
Oh, my goodness!

1636
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:11,470
Break, break, break.

1637
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:21,450
There he goes again, storming out of the cage!

1638
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:24,380
Tommy Riordan marching off through the crowd

1639
01:33:24,450 --> 01:33:28,130
and straight into the final four, ladies and gentlemen.

1640
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:30,830
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

1641
01:33:57,530 --> 01:33:59,750
- So where is he? - Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1642
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:02,070
Make a right at that white sign...

1643
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:14,380
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1644
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:24,890
I know that that other thing is

1645
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:29,940
bothering the hell out of you.

1646
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:33,530
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

1647
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,110
What you did for that kid in the tank,

1648
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,910
that was really something.

1649
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:45,160
How about deserting my unit?

1650
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:48,920
Is that really something, too?

1651
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:58,090
I was on my way out of the country when I came across those guys.

1652
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,720
What was I supposed to do? Let them drown?

1653
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:01,920
No.

1654
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:07,510
- What did you do? - What did I do?

1655
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:11,730
I took off.

1656
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:17,490
That's why you go by Riordan.

1657
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:21,950
That's why they can't find your service records.

1658
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:28,040
What the hell happened over there, Tommy?

1659
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,090
That is none of your business, man.

1660
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:34,010
Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.

1661
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,550
I've done it, I've seen it.

1662
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:38,220
You can trust me. I understand.

1663
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:41,340
Will you spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop?

1664
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:44,470
The suit don't fit.

1665
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,470
Tommy.

1666
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:49,430
I'm really trying here.

1667
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:53,020
- You're trying? - Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1668
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:54,270
Now?

1669
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:59,280
Where were you when it mattered?

1670
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,410
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.

1671
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:04,330
I don't need you now.

1672
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:05,860
You know, it's too late now.

1673
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:08,500
Everything's already happened.

1674
01:36:09,490 --> 01:36:12,590
You and Brendan don't seem to understand that.

1675
01:36:13,290 --> 01:36:16,210
Let me explain something to you, okay?

1676
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:19,590
The only thing that I have in common with Brendan Conlon

1677
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:21,550
is that the pair of us,

1678
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:25,430
we have absolutely no use for you.

1679
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,350
Look at you.

1680
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,150
Yeah, I was right.

1681
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:37,950
I think I liked you better when you were a drunk.

1682
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:40,150
At least you had some balls then, not like now,

1683
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:44,410
tiptoeing around, like some beggar with your cup out.

1684
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:47,890
Take it somewhere else.

1685
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:49,420
In fact, you know what?

1686
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:50,540
Here's a cup.

1687
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:51,820
Why don't you take this and

1688
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:54,000
go get yourself some more of your shitty tapes...

1689
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,110
Don't do this, Tommy.

1690
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:55,950
and you go back to the room

1691
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:56,950
and you listen to some more...

1692
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:57,710
Don't do this.

1693
01:36:57,790 --> 01:36:59,930
fish stories that no one gives a shit about.

1694
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:01,290
Now get out of here.

1695
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,390
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1696
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:46,220
God pity them!

1697
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,300
All shall perish except me!

1698
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,850
Bastards. Bastards!

1699
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:01,100
You bastards. You bastards!

1700
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,690
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1701
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:07,120
Ishmael. God pity them.

1702
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:11,240
Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.

1703
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:16,040
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1704
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:18,800
Ahab.

1705
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,970
You godless son of a bitch!

1706
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,920
You stop the ship!

1707
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,130
You godless son of a bitch!

1708
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:31,220
"'The whale! The ship! ' cried the cringing oarsmen.

1709
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,300
"'Oars! Oars! Slope downward...

1710
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:34,600
Stop it.

1711
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,350
O sea that ere it be for ever too late,

1712
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:40,860
"Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark!"'

1713
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,070
Captain...

1714
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:47,200
Stop the...

1715
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:49,570
Captain, stop...

1716
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:52,000
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1717
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:55,490
For the love of God.

1718
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:58,210
They're lost.

1719
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,170
Stop... the ship.

1720
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:06,380
Ahab...

1721
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:11,170
You stop the...

1722
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:17,140
Oh, no.

1723
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,650
- Come on, give me the Walkman. - No.

1724
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:25,950
- No, no. - Come on.

1725
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,900
Come on, come on. Come, give me the bottle.

1726
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:29,950
Come here, come here, come here.

1727
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:32,370
- Come on. Give me. - No.

1728
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,010
Tommy.

1729
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,720
We're lost.

1730
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:50,210
We're lost, Tommy.

1731
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,010
It's over. We'll never make it back.

1732
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:59,600
- Stay down. - We'll never make it back.

1733
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:11,780
I'm here.

1734
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:19,250
I always loved you.

1735
01:40:21,410 --> 01:40:23,790
You know that, don't you, Tommy?

1736
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:26,380
I always loved you.

1737
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,300
You and your brother. My two boys.

1738
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:50,110
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

1739
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:07,260
Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel without his trainer.

1740
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:14,470
Once again, no walk-out music.

1741
01:41:17,630 --> 01:41:20,140
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1742
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:28,190
Bryan, it sounds like V-J day in Times Square.

1743
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:30,270
I've never seen anything like this.

1744
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:50,260
Tommy acknowledging his comrades for the first time

1745
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:52,510
and climbing into the cage.

1746
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:59,430
Mad Dog Grimes has been waiting for revenge

1747
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:00,510
ever since the day Tommy

1748
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:02,230
Riordan walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1749
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,150
and turned his life upside down.

1750
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,600
It's been a very long and very

1751
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,940
miserable few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.

1752
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:10,990
Grimes mocking Riordan by

1753
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:13,950
having a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1754
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:17,320
and the Marines are really letting Mad Dog have it.

1755
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:22,370
All right, gentlemen.

1756
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,580
All right, gentlemen, we've been over your instructions.

1757
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:29,960
I expect a clean fight.

1758
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,960
Obey my commands at all times, defend yourselves at all times.

1759
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,920
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1760
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,880
It's not gonna happen again.

1761
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,070
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.

1762
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:42,010
He can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.

1763
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:43,510
He predicted an early knockout.

1764
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:46,310
He said he was gonna take Tommy out with one punch.

1765
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:46,940
And by the way,

1766
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:48,940
he said, "They're gonna have to pull me off him."

1767
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:51,890
We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.

1768
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,900
Gentlemen, you ready?

1769
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,740
You ready?

1770
01:42:58,650 --> 01:43:00,870
- Let's go to war! - Here they go and they are off!

1771
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,830
Tommy tackles him, and he's on top!

1772
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:06,580
He's raining bombs!

1773
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:09,080
- Cover up! - Come on, work it.

1774
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,790
- Raining bombs. - Mad Dog is out.

1775
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:14,000
Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.

1776
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,580
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1777
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:19,630
Break! Break! Break!

1778
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:24,180
That's the fastest knockout I think I've ever experienced!

1779
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:27,730
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed. He is not moving.

1780
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:31,300
You do that to someone on the street,

1781
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,240
they lock you up and throw away the key.

1782
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:34,900
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

1783
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:35,900
This guy's walking away

1784
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,730
from the cage like he's leaving a crime scene!

1785
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:40,990
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

1786
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:49,620
- Everybody through. Come on, move it out. - Sparta!

1787
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:06,050
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1788
01:44:06,130 --> 01:44:07,560
I'm on your side.

1789
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,150
Let's go.

1790
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:21,280
- Principal Zito, there he is. - Nice.

1791
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,990
Let's go, Brendan.

1792
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:31,670
Brendan Conlon came into

1793
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:33,960
this tournament as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1794
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,260
and now here he is in the final four.

1795
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:38,230
The crowd snowing their appreciation.

1796
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:39,930
He's getting quite the reception.

1797
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,930
He's got a huge reception. I mean, this guy shocked everybody.

1798
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:47,140
Come on, come on. You all right?

1799
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:51,400
You've got a visitor.

1800
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,570
Second row, 10 o'clock.

1801
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:05,280
You all right with that?

1802
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,250
I love you.

1803
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:16,920
And here comes the great Russian, Koba.

1804
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,720
Koba is so intimidating and his reputation is larger than life.

1805
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:24,050
- Koba! Koba! - Koba! Koba!

1806
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:30,640
I want you to look right at

1807
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,810
him when he comes in here. Look right at him.

1808
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:35,610
All right? Don't take your eyes off him.

1809
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,130
I'm proud of you, brother.

1810
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:07,470
This is your cage.

1811
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:20,690
Gentlemen.

1812
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:30,160
All right, gentlemen, we've been over your instructions.

1813
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:31,700
I expect a clean fight.

1814
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:34,530
Obey my commands at all times, defend yourselves at all times.

1815
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:37,170
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1816
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,710
Should I be nervous for Brendan? 'Cause I am.

1817
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:45,970
I wanna stop the fight before it even gets going.

1818
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:47,080
Well, here we go.

1819
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,140
He's like a machine. Look at him.

1820
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,470
Gentlemen, you ready?

1821
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:55,690
You ready? Let's go to war!

1822
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,260
Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.

1823
01:46:57,350 --> 01:47:01,270
But now, the question is, how long can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1824
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,650
Angle out of it!

1825
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,150
Keep moving!

1826
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:10,240
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1827
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:16,740
Keep moving! Keep moving! Get away from him!

1828
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:18,540
Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!

1829
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,670
- Crushing body shots. - Relax, you're okay.

1830
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:24,670
Conlon's down, and Koba pounces and starts pounding!

1831
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,130
Get up! Get up!

1832
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:28,180
He's just pounding on him like a side of beef.

1833
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:29,800
Go, go, go. Get up!

1834
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:31,800
He's getting his ass whooped.

1835
01:47:34,630 --> 01:47:36,100
And now he's got him in the air!

1836
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:37,850
Oh, God.

1837
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:40,180
Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!

1838
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:46,200
I think Campana has to think seriously about...

1839
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:47,390
How much abuse can one man take?

1840
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:48,620
continuing another round of this.

1841
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:49,820
Go to war!

1842
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:57,370
Just relax! Relax! Relax! Off the fence!

1843
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:01,700
Brendan's going for a ride!

1844
01:48:01,790 --> 01:48:04,380
That one shook the entire building!

1845
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,420
Man, he just threw him against the fence like a rag doll.

1846
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:12,300
Get up! Get up! Come on! Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!

1847
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:14,100
And now he's on top! Koba's on top,

1848
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:15,420
and he's finishing him, here.

1849
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,140
Look at this. On the edge of blowing it.

1850
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:19,140
Get off the fence, Brendan!

1851
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:21,890
You wonder how Conlon can take this kind of beating on his arms.

1852
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:25,070
- His forearms and his hands. - Drop that neck!

1853
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:26,650
How much can one man take?

1854
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,030
Break! Break! Break!

1855
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,540
Everybody has got to be a little bit concerned

1856
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:36,360
about Brendan Conlon's bravery getting him in trouble here.

1857
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:38,410
His bravery could get him killed, frankly.

1858
01:48:38,490 --> 01:48:40,660
And by the way, he's got nothing more to prove.

1859
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:42,130
He's lasted two rounds with Koba.

1860
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:42,540
That's true, that's true.

1861
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:44,750
And you wonder what's keeping this guy up.

1862
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:47,800
Sit down. Sit down.

1863
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,540
Breathe. Breathe!

1864
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:53,380
Look at me. Look at me!

1865
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:56,760
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it. Hold it, small sips.

1866
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,180
Why are we here? Why are we here, Brendan?

1867
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:03,730
Why are we here? Are we here to win this fight?

1868
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:05,060
Are we here to win this fight?

1869
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:06,890
You tell me. 'Cause if we're not,

1870
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:07,820
I will throw in the towel.

1871
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:09,860
We will get Tess and we will go home.

1872
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,940
We'll go home, okay?

1873
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:14,940
You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.

1874
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:16,990
Do you understand me?

1875
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:20,830
You don't knock him out, you don't have a home.

1876
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,280
Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!

1877
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:44,810
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1878
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:52,530
Conlon somehow answering the call to round three.

1879
01:49:52,610 --> 01:49:55,030
And Koba's all over him once again.

1880
01:49:58,110 --> 01:49:59,330
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1881
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,250
I mean, there's signs of life in Brendan Conlon.

1882
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:03,660
He's starting to mix it up.

1883
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:13,170
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1884
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:18,340
He's taking Koba down, but the Russian's back up.

1885
01:50:19,130 --> 01:50:20,930
Brendan shoots him again, pressing him against the cage.

1886
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:23,760
- Yes! - Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1887
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:25,720
Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,

1888
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:27,770
and Koba now squeezing his neck for all it's worth,

1889
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:28,850
trying to choke the teacher out.

1890
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:31,780
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!

1891
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:33,860
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1892
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:36,450
Conlon looking for a way out.

1893
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:37,120
What is this?

1894
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,370
Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1895
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,120
He just shook off a guillotine and tossed Koba.

1896
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,420
Conlon's looking for an armbar. He's looking for that armbar,

1897
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:47,040
- and he's trying to submit the Russian bear. - Hips, hips, hips!

1898
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,500
Yeah, you got him! You got him! You got him!

1899
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,920
Koba slips right out.

1900
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:54,380
Conlon's staying after him. He's squeezing the bear.

1901
01:50:54,710 --> 01:50:55,930
The tables have turned and

1902
01:50:55,930 --> 01:50:58,180
the boy scout is actually messing with the bear.

1903
01:50:58,250 --> 01:51:00,380
The teacher springing off the fence and going for a mountain,

1904
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:01,470
- but Koba's on his feet. - Get up, get up!

1905
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:03,050
He does not want to be on the ground with Brendan

1906
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:05,140
and his endless bag of submissions.

1907
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:06,490
Koba trying to reestablish

1908
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:08,640
his dominance with brutal shots to the face.

1909
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:11,650
But Conlon's showing no fear. This is a fight!

1910
01:51:11,730 --> 01:51:13,980
We have got ourselves a fight!

1911
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:19,990
Wow, that's a huge elbow to the head.

1912
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:22,320
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar. He's got it very deep!

1913
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,410
He's got it very, very deep!

1914
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:25,830
He's deep on that.

1915
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:28,000
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1916
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,870
We saw this with Midnight, we saw it against The Dane,

1917
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:31,670
and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...

1918
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,550
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1919
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:36,670
Not letting out!

1920
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,850
Conlon wrenching that knee for all it's worth.

1921
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,670
He's putting everything he has into it.

1922
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:44,520
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1923
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:45,590
Koba taps.

1924
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:48,100
Koba has tapped! Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1925
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:51,980
I can't believe it! Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1926
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:54,650
He's tapped Koba!

1927
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:57,480
And Frank Campana can't believe it.

1928
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:00,110
This whole place can't believe it. I can't believe it.

1929
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:03,410
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.

1930
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:07,620
- Tess! - You got it! You did it!

1931
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:11,000
Brendan taps the world Sambo champ with a knee bar!

1932
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:12,700
- Babe, you did it! - Brendan Conlon!

1933
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:13,820
I don't know what to say.

1934
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:15,540
- It's amazing! - I don't know what I just saw.

1935
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:17,800
I just don't know how to put this into context.

1936
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:20,720
That's gotta be the biggest upset in MMA history.

1937
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,890
I have never seen anything like this.

1938
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,430
He tapped a world Sambo champion in a knee bar!

1939
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:31,560
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!

1940
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,770
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!

1941
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:35,490
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1942
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:37,730
He's done the impossible.

1943
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:41,280
He has done the impossible. He's pulled off a miracle.

1944
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:45,500
This place is going crazy because they've just seen a miracle.

1945
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:59,790
This is CNN Breaking News.

1946
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:03,080
A surprising turn in the story

1947
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:04,260
of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.

1948
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:07,840
CNN has learned that Riordan's true identity

1949
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:10,770
is that of Marine Staff Sergeant Thomas Conlon,

1950
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:13,720
who went AWOL from his unit earlier this year,

1951
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:16,690
following the friendly fire death of his brother-in-arms,

1952
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:18,150
Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

1953
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,360
Fernandez's wife, Pilar Fernandez, spoke with me

1954
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:24,070
in an exclusive interview, moments ago.

1955
01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:26,660
The bombs started dropping.

1956
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:30,280
They were coming from US planes.

1957
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:34,210
Tommy and Manny were waving their flags

1958
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,630
to let them know they were Americans,

1959
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:39,330
but they didn't stop.

1960
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,380
Everyone died.

1961
01:53:43,090 --> 01:53:45,010
Everyone except Tommy.

1962
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,310
And, you know, my Manny used to say,

1963
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:54,560
that Tommy was the brother he never had.

1964
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:56,640
Conlon, who is fighting in

1965
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,190
the mixed martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,

1966
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:02,650
is expected to be taken into custody by military police,

1967
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:05,860
following tonight's winner-take-all finale in Atlantic City.

1968
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:10,320
If victorious, he has pledged his $5 million purse

1969
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,280
to the widow of his fallen comrade.

1970
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:15,990
We've just got some incredible news,

1971
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,750
that I'm having trouble putting into context, but here it is.

1972
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:23,010
The two men fighting for the championship tonight,

1973
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:25,260
for the $5 million prize,

1974
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:28,850
for the middleweight championship of the world,

1975
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:30,430
are brothers.

1976
01:54:56,620 --> 01:54:58,870
All right, let's get this off.

1977
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,970
What are you gonna do?

1978
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:24,600
I'm gonna fight him.

1979
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:38,890
Mr. C, Mr. C! Mr. C, Mr. C!

1980
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:27,810
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

1981
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:27,500
Gentlemen.

1982
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:36,760
Gentlemen, this is the final. I expect a clean fight.

1983
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,930
Obey my commands at all times, defend yourselves at all times.

1984
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:41,810
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1985
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,310
Where's Pop?

1986
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,700
Gentlemen, are you ready?

1987
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:08,370
Are you ready?

1988
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:10,880
Let's go to war!

1989
01:59:22,930 --> 01:59:24,890
Relax, Brendan, relax!

1990
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:30,560
Get out! Get out of there!

1991
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:33,730
Throw your hands!

1992
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:36,990
Throw your hands!

1993
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:39,160
Don't lose it. No, no, no!

1994
01:59:39,230 --> 01:59:40,740
Move! Move!

1995
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:46,080
Tie him up! Tie him up! Control his moves. Control his moves.

1996
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:48,960
Control the arms! Keep control in the arms! Breathe!

1997
01:59:49,490 --> 01:59:52,420
You're okay! Relax! Breathe!

1998
01:59:58,250 --> 02:00:00,430
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1999
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,430
Relax! Breathe!

2000
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:05,680
Tie him up! Get up! Tie him up, Brendan! Tie him up!

2001
02:00:06,390 --> 02:00:07,760
Come on. Get him! Get him! Get him!

2002
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,110
Break!

2003
02:00:10,350 --> 02:00:11,600
What was that?

2004
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:13,100
Hey, come on, Josh!

2005
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:14,440
What's up with that?

2006
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:16,520
Hey, step back!

2007
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:18,150
Watch that late blow!

2008
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:20,110
Come on!

2009
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:30,210
Come on, Josh! I mean, what is that?

2010
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:32,460
Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

2011
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:34,330
Sit... Brendan, sit down.

2012
02:00:34,410 --> 02:00:36,510
Look at me. Sit down.

2013
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:39,300
Brendan, look at me. Look at me.

2014
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:44,880
Look at me, Brendan. Let it go. Let it go, okay?

2015
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:47,510
Breathe. Beethoven.

2016
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:51,510
Okay. He's coming right at you, right? Exactly like we planned.

2017
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,730
I want you to angle out, hit and move every time. All right?

2018
02:00:54,810 --> 02:00:56,110
- Angle out and move. - Good.

2019
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:58,650
Breathe. Breathe. Come on, relax.

2020
02:01:00,730 --> 02:01:02,760
Okay. He's not your brother, right?

2021
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:03,580
Time's up!

2022
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:05,490
Look at me. He's not your brother, right?

2023
02:01:05,570 --> 02:01:06,660
- All right. - He's in the way.

2024
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:09,120
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

2025
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:11,620
Taking a little more time for the cheap shot.

2026
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:16,000
Do your job, Josh.

2027
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:22,500
Come on, babe. Come on.

2028
02:01:22,670 --> 02:01:24,260
Let's go to war.

2029
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:25,340
Breathe!

2030
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:32,730
Pace, pace! Control the pace!

2031
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:44,020
Cover up!

2032
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:47,290
Come on, get off the fence!

2033
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,530
Get off the fence!

2034
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,580
Hands up! Hands up!

2035
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:54,960
Head up! You're all right! Relax! Breathe!

2036
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:05,550
Get him!

2037
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:11,600
- Huge throw. Huge. - Look at that.

2038
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:13,300
Turn in! Don't give him your back!

2039
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:15,060
Turn in! Go! Good! Good!

2040
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:20,310
Come on, get out of it! Go! Get up!

2041
02:02:21,850 --> 02:02:23,280
Control the arms! Control the arms!

2042
02:02:25,650 --> 02:02:28,200
Cover up, cover up. Push it!

2043
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:31,410
Break free! Break! Break!

2044
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:36,040
Good, good, good! Clean break! Stop! Hey, stop!

2045
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:37,750
- Come on. - Here we go, mom.

2046
02:02:37,830 --> 02:02:41,380
Time to lock up your china, the boys are at it again!

2047
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:48,430
Let's go to war!

2048
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,320
Now! Get up! Get up!

2049
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:10,870
Get up! Come on, babe! Get up! Get up! Get up!

2050
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,790
Control it! Control it with the arms.

2051
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:14,410
Switch! Switch!

2052
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:17,880
Hips!

2053
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:20,160
Down, down. Hips down.

2054
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:27,210
Oh, my God. That's a deep omoplata there. He's got the seats up.

2055
02:03:28,630 --> 02:03:30,300
Come on, Tommy!

2056
02:03:35,090 --> 02:03:37,390
You've got him, babe! You've got him, babe! Come on, tap him out!

2057
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:39,260
Tom!

2058
02:03:46,770 --> 02:03:48,020
Break! Break! Break!

2059
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:50,660
Tommy, you okay?

2060
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:57,660
- Tommy! - Go! Let's go! Go!

2061
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:59,160
Calm down. Calm down.

2062
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,630
It's the championship. Keep it together.

2063
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:02,750
All right. All right. I got it.

2064
02:04:02,830 --> 02:04:04,330
Sit down. Sit down!

2065
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:13,600
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

2066
02:04:13,670 --> 02:04:16,890
- I popped his shoulder. - Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

2067
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:18,600
- I heard it tear. - You popped his shoulder?

2068
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:19,730
- Yeah. - Good. Okay.

2069
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:22,430
I want you to pop his other shoulder. Let's go.

2070
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,390
- Josh. - Hey, hey, no Josh.

2071
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:25,600
- Josh. - Hey!

2072
02:04:25,690 --> 02:04:27,110
- Look at me. Look at me. - What?

2073
02:04:27,190 --> 02:04:28,990
All right, you got two rounds. Two rounds.

2074
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:30,360
We need both rounds.

2075
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:34,200
What?

2076
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:37,370
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

2077
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:45,690
Go in there, you kick him in the head,

2078
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:47,040
take him down and finish him!

2079
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:57,010
Tommy, what are you doing?

2080
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,390
Shut up. Come on.

2081
02:05:00,350 --> 02:05:01,810
Stand back.

2082
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:05,690
Come on. What? Have you gone crazy?

2083
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:08,860
Let's go to war!

2084
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:12,570
Brendan, pick your hands up!

2085
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:14,530
It's over.

2086
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:18,410
What are you doing? What are you doing?

2087
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:21,580
It's over, Tommy.

2088
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:22,830
You better fight!

2089
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:35,850
It's over, Tommy. Come on.

2090
02:05:39,970 --> 02:05:42,350
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

2091
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:56,740
Come on. Why do you want to do this, Tommy?

2092
02:05:57,070 --> 02:05:58,410
Am I gonna have to watch you do this?

2093
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:08,330
Okay? You all right there?

2094
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:10,470
Tommy!

2095
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:23,390
Quick, finish him! You finish him!

2096
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:31,440
Come on.

2097
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:45,170
Break, break, break! Back up, back up!

2098
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:09,650
Today you were far away

2099
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:26,990
and I didn't ask you why

2100
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:35,730
What could I say

2101
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:44,110
I was far away

2102
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:52,510
slip away

2103
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:09,460
How close am I to losing you

2104
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:39,900
Hey, are you awake

2105
02:08:41,550 --> 02:08:43,120
Yeah I'm right here

2106
02:08:42,690 --> 02:08:46,290
I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry.

2107
02:08:49,490 --> 02:08:51,460
Tap, Tommy.

2108
02:08:44,270 --> 02:08:53,770
Well can I ask you about today

2109
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:54,590
It's okay. It's okay.

2110
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:06,100
I love you.

2111
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:08,800
I love you, Tommy.

2112
02:09:01,530 --> 02:09:10,450
How close am I to losing you
