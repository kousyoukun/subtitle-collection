1
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,320
Hey, Jenny.
That was a wonderful share, tonight.

2
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:24,548
"Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck.

3
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,300
"Enter Ahab. Then, all.

4
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,804
It was not a great while
after the affair of the pipe,

5
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,557
that one morning, shortly after breakfast,
Ahab, as was his wont,

6
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,355
"ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.

7
00:01:55,449 --> 00:02:00,125
"'It's a white whale, I say 'resumed Ahab,
as he threw down the top-maul.

8
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:04,208
"A white whale-
Skin your eyes for him, men,

9
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,841
"look sharp for white water;
if ye see but a bubble, sing out."

10
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,622
Tommy?

11
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,996
Jesus!

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,384
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,795
Well, I was just passing through

14
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,724
and I figured why not have a belt
with the old man.

15
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,551
Yeah.

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,393
She looks good.

17
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,359
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

18
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,405
Well, you always did take good care of her.

19
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
Paddy Conlon.

20
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,074
Man of priorities.

21
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,588
I got a little something for you.

22
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,755
Mom always said,
"Never go anywhere empty-handed."

23
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,086
She did.

24
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,926
That's not for me anymore, Tommy.

25
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,637
What? You changed brands?

26
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,021
Let's go inside, huh?

27
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,611
Tommy!

28
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,273
Come on, let's go inside.

29
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,131
I like what you've done with the place.

30
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,683
Yeah, I appreciate that.

31
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,805
There's not much of a woman's touch
around here.

32
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,641
Yeah, well...

33
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,402
And no more women for me, Tommy.

34
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,113
Yeah.

35
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,410
It must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

36
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,576
Here you go.

37
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,254
Coffee?

38
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,168
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years
and you're not gonna have a drink with him?

39
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,379
-Come on.
-I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

40
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,339
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

41
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,350
-Come on, it's just a drink.
-No.

42
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,968
He's a school teacher down in Philly.

43
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,221
Remember Tess?

44
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,015
They had two beautiful little girls.

45
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,499
So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.

46
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,341
I think Mom kept calling out for him,
but he wasn't around.

47
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,806
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all the drunks, huh?

48
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,592
Who knew?

49
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,684
So, you gonna ask about her,

50
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,445
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

51
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,653
-I know.
-You know? What do you know? Huh?

52
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:42,609
Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west
to get away from you,

53
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,366
that once we hit the water,
we drove north, too?

54
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,159
When I got sober, I hired a man to find you.

55
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:53,849
And is that one of the 12 steps?

56
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:56,162
Or does a guy like you get 24?

57
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,879
Just 12.

58
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,312
Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

59
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,025
Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

60
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,316
But you were in the Marines.

61
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,114
That was all.

62
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,911
That was enough.

63
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,285
Well, that's too bad,

64
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,541
'cause you could've gotten
some good details.

65
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,206
You could've heard about her
coughing up blood on her knees

66
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,171
in a shit box with no heat.

67
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,884
Having me rub her down with holy water,
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

68
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,639
All the time waiting for your pal,
Jesus, to save her.

69
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,442
Did your man tell you that?

70
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,106
I'm sorry, Tommy.

71
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,374
Well, it's good to know
that you're sorry, Pop.

72
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,496
It goes a long way.

73
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,971
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

74
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,146
All right, then. All right, all right, all right.

75
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,856
You say I can, but you say I can't.

76
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,159
-What about if we all get a unicorn?
-No.

77
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,781
-Don't you want a unicorn?
-No.

78
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,412
What's going on up here?

79
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,164
-Oh, my goodness.
-Well, I'm not sure,

80
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,873
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

81
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,754
-Daddy, you look so handsome.
-Do I?

82
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,585
-He's a very pretty princess.
-We're painting Daddy's face.

83
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,754
Yeah, you are.

84
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,768
Okay. Yeah.
Em, you wanna open your presents?

85
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,015
-Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.
-Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,691
-All right! It's time for presents!
-I have to put this down.

87
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,735
-Here. You wanna put it down?
-Presents time!

88
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,733
-Everybody, come bring your presents!
-What is it? What is it?

89
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,613
Let's start with this one.
How about that, Emily?

90
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,948
-All right.
-Happy birthday, Emily.

91
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,655
-What did you get? What did you get?
-Babe?

92
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,449
It's an awfully big box.

93
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,326
It's her birthday. Come on.

94
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,161
I know, babe,
but that's why you call it a budget.

95
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,838
You set it and you don't budge.

96
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,837
-This one's mine.
-Hey, open the big box!

97
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,376
It's okay.

98
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,006
-I love you. Be good, okay?
-Bye, Mommy.

99
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,343
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

100
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,846
-Hey, babe. I'm late.
-Hey.

101
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,352
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,
she's got to get on the road.

102
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,810
-They've been fed, they just need a bath.
-I'm on it.

103
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,233
Okay, can you get them to bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

104
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,564
Because, after the party,
they're just exhausted.

105
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,945
Where's the rest of that skirt?

106
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,360
Babe.

107
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,736
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle
in that joint tonight,

108
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,197
you give me a call, okay?

109
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,156
Yeah, just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys

110
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,992
decided to smash up your face.

111
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,248
I told you, most nights,
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

112
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,422
but, every now and then,
I need some action.

113
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,428
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.
I'll see what I can do about that.

114
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,171
Promises, promises.

115
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,724
And we return here on MMA Live,

116
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,149
Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire
fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,

117
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,272
the Tapout crew is here,
Punk and Skrape are in the building.

118
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,270
Now, J.J., what led to this project

119
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,822
That is really redefining
mixed martial arts here in the States?

120
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,363
Well, mixed martial arts is a sport
I've been incredibly passionate about,

121
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,116
and as far as where
the idea for Sparta came from,

122
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,995
I've always really dug the Grand Prix format,
so I tracked these guys down.

123
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,244
And when J.J. came to us,
he said he wanted to create

124
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,873
the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts.

125
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,040
And he decided to put up
the $5 million purse, too.

126
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,090
Well, there you have it, it shall be done.
Hedge fund king, J.J. Riley,

127
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,718
going from the lions' den of Wall Street
to the cage,

128
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,472
and promoting the biggest winner-take-all
tournament in MMA history. Sparta...

129
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,598
Doing good. One more time.

130
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,725
Fitzy still own this?

131
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,058
I don't know no Fitzy.
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

132
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,811
Can I help you with something?

133
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,402
How does it work?

134
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,400
Thirty-five a month with locker.

135
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,653
We're open at 7:00, lights out at 11:00.

136
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,164
So you want to join?

137
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,741
Sure.

138
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,538
Put your name and contact info on the card.

139
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,673
Thank you.

140
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,684
All right. There's a lesson in this, too, okay?

141
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,021
Hold on, Tito.

142
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,314
So, we have a body at rest,

143
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,893
and you have the bat which needs...

144
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,853
-Acceleration.
-Acceleration, okay.

145
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,273
If you have enough acceleration,

146
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,949
you might have a chance
of breaking the body at rest.

147
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,654
-Okay. All right. You ready?
-Piece of cake.

148
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,328
Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!
Piece of cake!

149
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,867
Come on, man!

150
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,707
Come on, son!

151
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,623
All right! All right. There we go.
Well done, Tito. Well done.

152
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,633
Remind me not to mess with you.

153
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,675
Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.

154
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,048
So, have we got it?

155
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,764
Force equals mass times acceleration,
we got it.

156
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,310
All right. Has everybody else got it?

157
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,476
-Yeah.
-Yes? Okay, good. All right.

158
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,306
The third law...

159
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,483
How many laws this dude got?

160
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,398
-The dude?
-Yes, the dude.

161
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,354
The dude has three, all right?

162
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,321
Newton, the dude, says that
for every action,

163
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,324
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

164
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,748
For example,

165
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,999
if K.C. does not stop the action
of sending texts in class

166
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,788
and tell her posse outside to beat it,

167
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,626
then my reaction might be
to send her down to Principal Zito's office.

168
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,009
Thus setting the world back
in proper balance.

169
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,346
Mr. C, I put it away.

170
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,850
All right, before you go,
I have your tests from last week.

171
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,806
Just work it out.

172
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
Stop downing.

173
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,731
Pick up the hands.

174
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,527
Tighten it up!

175
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,576
Use your right.

176
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,195
Seal his hands, come on.

177
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,952
Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!

178
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,996
Go light!

179
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,045
I said, go light!

180
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,126
God damn it!

181
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,170
Where do you find these girls?

182
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,175
We got a tournament coming up,
you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

183
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,264
Oh, jeez.

184
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,353
Fenroy, get me some ice.

185
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,140
And call that Puerto Rican kid,
the one that fights out of the bottoms.

186
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,147
If he's here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

187
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,853
Yo, I'll fight him.

188
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,563
Do me a favor, guy, go back to your bag.

189
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,899
We don't need anybody else getting hurt.
Take a walk.

190
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,405
Let's go. Watch his neck.

191
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,699
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

192
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,497
did you leave Mick and Paulie
at home today?

193
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,953
His phone's disconnected.

194
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,756
Then go through the list.
Find me somebody. Get me Joe Bones.

195
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,301
All I'm saying is
that if you need somebody to help you,

196
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,093
I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.

197
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,685
You ever fought before?

198
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,769
Yeah.

199
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,608
Hey, this guy signed a waiver?

200
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,739
All good.

201
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,074
-What's your name?
-Tommy.

202
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,753
-You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.
-Sure, no problem. No problem.

203
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,290
Come on in.

204
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,262
Let's go. All right, let's go.

205
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,306
Hey. Watch that teeth.

206
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,514
Are you gonna be a hero? All right.

207
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,813
Come on. Check that kick.

208
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,272
Easy.

209
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,987
Come on, Dog, you can do it.
Let's go, come on.

210
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,828
-Good jab. Good jab!
-There we go!

211
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,163
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.
Don't let him take your back!

212
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,247
-Dog, get up.
-Get up!

213
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,258
Cover up, cover up!

214
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,841
Don't give him your back.
Don't give him your back!

215
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,182
-Cover up!
-Come on, Dog!

216
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,136
Cover up, damn it!

217
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,743
You owe me 200 bucks.

218
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,097
This one here.
See, this is the new appraisal figures

219
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,268
-that came in.
-Yeah.

220
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,517
And this is how it affects the monthly,
it turns into that.

221
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,475
And the total value of the loan,
over the life of the loan, is that.

222
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,809
As you can see, that's just the way it is.

223
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,519
It puts you upside down,
that's the problem.

224
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,775
It's the county that did the assessment,
not the bank.

225
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,232
So, the numbers are what they are,
Mr. Conlon...

226
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,409
-Brendan.
-The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

227
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,494
I mean, you're a math teacher, right?
You can appreciate that.

228
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,288
I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.

229
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,909
Physics, okay. But the bank has got to go
by the new appraisal figures.

230
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,666
And, according to these figures,
you're upside down on your mortgage,

231
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,418
-you understand?
-God, you said that like three times.

232
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,458
I'm sorry, but I get that.

233
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,841
I am asking you,
is there something else you can do?

234
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,431
Not the bank, you.
Can you shift things around, restructure?

235
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,008
You refinanced twice already.

236
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,764
'Cause you advised us to do that.

237
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,228
-You told me.
-Well, I presented you with that option,

238
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,600
but that was your choice.

239
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,481
I'm also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi.

240
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
We had that conversation.

241
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,316
I was paying medical bills.

242
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,369
Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?

243
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,285
-Heart.
-Heart. Right, sorry.

244
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,746
A lot of stories.

245
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,871
All right, so, if that's my option,
I have no options.

246
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,207
You're not even gonna try and help me.
You're not even gonna try.

247
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,089
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,
I can get you 90 days to get even.

248
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,215
Ninety days is not enough.

249
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,969
My wife and I,
we have three jobs between us.

250
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,677
And that doesn't cut it.

251
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,313
So, what do you suggest?

252
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,976
Well, let me ask you a question?
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

253
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,152
It's a viable option.

254
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,152
There's no shame in this these days.

255
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,616
That's not how I do things.

256
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,834
Okay, well, then
you're looking at foreclosure.

257
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,676
Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,
the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.

258
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,305
The prodigy has yet to yield a single point
in the entire tournament.

259
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,602
Tommy, trained by his father
since the age of Eve.

260
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,521
-Talking about Paddy Conlon?
-The controversial Paddy Conlon.

261
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,229
Say what you will about the methods
of the former Marine,

262
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,027
but he's led his son
to six straight Junior Olympic titles

263
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,855
and now just moments away
from a High School State Championship.

264
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,111
And there it is! Wow!

265
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,118
There 's just no limit
to what the future holds for this kid.

266
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,788
Tommy told me that he's chasing
the record of Theogenes,

267
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,618
apparently, a mythical Greek fighter
said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.

268
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,793
Hi, how're you doing, sir?
I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.

269
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,504
-Who?
-Tommy Riordan.

270
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,465
My name is Colt Boyd.

271
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,388
What business you got with Tommy?

272
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,593
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.
I manage fighters.

273
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,601
So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,

274
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,563
and he put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

275
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,987
So, I want to know
a little bit more about the guy.

276
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,988
Maybe help him out.

277
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,535
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

278
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,118
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

279
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,830
And anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

280
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,627
you gotta ask him yourself.

281
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
Look, I'm just asking
for some general information here.

282
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,299
Like I said, anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

283
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,921
you gotta ask him yourself.

284
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,677
Look, I don't mean
to interrupt your night, okay?

285
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,096
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

286
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,094
He doesn't live here.

287
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,428
-All right, then.
-Okay. Good night.

288
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,699
All right, listen, kiddo.
I need you to put Mommy back on, okay?

289
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,908
I love you.

290
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,071
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in,
I'm gonna have to go.

291
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,703
No, they got an open mic night thing on,
it's gonna be a quiet one.

292
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,252
All right, sleep well.

293
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,799
You, too. All right, bye.

294
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,924
It's about time for your next contest.

295
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:03,354
Introducing first, in the red corner;
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.

296
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:08,230
Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.

297
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,393
Say, "Uncle!"

298
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,986
Go, Mike. Go!

299
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:20,159
And his opponent in the blue corner;
he fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

300
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:24,622
Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.

301
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,216
This bout is scheduled
for three, five-minute rounds,

302
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,179
and when the action begins,
your referee is Mr Rick Fike.

303
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:38,802
Fighters to the center

304
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,559
Come on, gentlemen.

305
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,729
I want you to obey my commands
at all times.

306
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,932
I want you to protect yourselves at all times.

307
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,358
If you have no questions,
touch gloves, back up.

308
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,936
And on my signal, let's come out fighting

309
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,903
Fighter, are you ready?

310
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,324
Are you ready?

311
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,579
Do it!

312
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,003
Come on, Mike, let's go!

313
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,641
You gotta move with that one.

314
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:44,864
Come on, Mike!

315
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,377
Don't let him do that to you, Mike!

316
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,090
Get up, Mike, get up!

317
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,861
-First five minutes, out.
-Another 15? Great.

318
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,906
Hey! Hey, kid!

319
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,577
Nice fight.
Two more wins, you take home the bacon.

320
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,960
Hey, good job...

321
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:47,852
Hey, babe.

322
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,185
Hey.

323
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,130
How was work?

324
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,219
Oh, my God!

325
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,970
What happened?

326
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,098
You said it was gonna be a slow night.

327
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,028
I'm not bouncing at a club.

328
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:44,158
What do you mean you're not bouncing?

329
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,341
You've been lying to me?

330
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,180
I went in to apply

331
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,515
and they were paying nine bucks an hour.

332
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,945
Then I saw a sign for this other thing.

333
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,957
They're putting us out of the house
in three months.

334
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,125
We're running out of options.

335
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,873
Then they put us out of the house
in three months.

336
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,708
I'd rather go back to the old apartment

337
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,882
than see you in the back
of an ambulance again.

338
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,048
I thought we agreed
that we weren't gonna raise our children

339
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,722
in a family where their father
gets beat up for a living.

340
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,225
We're not giving up the house.

341
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,139
It's our home.

342
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,108
We're not going backwards.

343
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,949
We'll figure it Out.

344
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,037
This is what we're not going back to.

345
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,805
You wanted to talk?

346
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,690
Yeah.

347
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,229
I'm gonna start fighting.

348
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,110
Is that right?

349
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,236
Don't play babe in the woods with me.

350
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,659
I know that guy from the gym
came to see you.

351
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,237
Colt Boyd.

352
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,452
Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.

353
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,952
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you now if you did.

354
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,332
-Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
-No. Thank you. I'm fine.

355
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,419
-Hon, would you like a cup of coffee? Okay.
-Sure. Thank you.

356
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,544
All right.

357
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,721
There's this tournament,

358
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,382
it's a big tournament.

359
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,765
Top 16 middleweights in the world.
Single elimination.

360
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,643
Winner takes all. It's a lot of money.

361
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,108
-Okay.
-I'm gonna do that.

362
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,070
But if I'm doing it,

363
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,202
then I'm gonna need a trainer.

364
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,031
Now, that much, you were good at.

365
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,579
What?

366
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,712
No, no, no.
This doesn't mean anything, okay?

367
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,880
I'm serious.

368
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,007
We train. That's it.

369
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,631
I don't want to hear a word
about anything but training.

370
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,257
You understand?

371
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,262
You want to tell your war stories,
you can take them down to the VFW.

372
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,727
Or you can take it to a meeting, or to church,

373
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,226
or whatever the hell it is
that you do nowadays.

374
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,023
What about Colt Boyd?

375
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,601
What about him? I told him
I don't train with people that I don't know.

376
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,107
-The devil you know.
-Excuse me?

377
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,237
The devil you know
is better than the devil you don’t.

378
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,908
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

379
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,202
There's your coffee, hon.

380
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,124
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

381
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,755
Chasing Theogenes
It'll be kind of like the old times.

382
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,500
I just told you, this doesn't mean anything.

383
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,387
Now, get that through your skull right now
or I'm walking.

384
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,305
All right. All right.

385
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,012
But you get something
through your skull, too.

386
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,268
You called me, so don't go
threatening to walk every five minutes.

387
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,442
And since this is about training,

388
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,397
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those pills are concerned.

389
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,402
I don't wanna see them.

390
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,617
In fact, hand them over right now.

391
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,530
I know they're on you, Tommy.

392
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,368
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

393
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,048
That's not gonna do.

394
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,808
When you came through that door, it was...

395
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,770
Three.

396
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:16,858
That'a boy.

397
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,241
And another thing.
You don't eat crap like this.

398
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,493
This is for losers and old men.

399
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,243
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

400
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,579
If we're gonna do this right,
you're gonna stay at the house.

401
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,333
I watch your diet.
We follow the old regimen.

402
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,210
You copy?

403
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,838
All right.

404
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,683
COPY-

405
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,023
Your brother's a liar.

406
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,608
-...went in the middle of the night...
-Yeah.

407
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,194
...and he went to a strip club,
and he said he saw Mr. C...

408
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,494
-No way.
-Front and center.

409
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,868
-Like MMA type stuff.
-You weren't there, so you don't know.

410
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:06,949
What’s MMA?

411
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:07,999
-Mixed martial arts.
-Like, fighting.

412
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,452
Like, different styles of fighting.

413
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,878
He was just, like,
dropped him on the floor...

414
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,256
It's true?

415
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,258
Take your seats.

416
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,680
Now, please.

417
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,943
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

418
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,437
Hey, my brother was at the titty bar
last night,

419
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:41,071
and he said you was choking brothers out.
I mean, what's up, is it true?

420
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,235
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, like, is it true?

421
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,161
Did you really work on some fools
or something?

422
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,160
-You have to tell us.
-Yeah.

423
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,504
All right.
I want examples of forms of energy.

424
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,696
Come on. It's not as bad as it looks.

425
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:28,872
Are you being literal or figurative?
Because, literally, it looks bad.

426
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,417
And figuratively, it looks even worse.

427
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,707
The superintendent's coming by.
Few minutes.

428
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,665
Oh, man.

429
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,965
So, come on, Brendan.
Give me a little help here.

430
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,465
I mean, could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

431
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:52,805
I need the money, Joe.

432
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,565
Yeah, but this is...

433
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,355
We can't have this.

434
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,779
This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's,
for Christ's sake.

435
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,740
Shit, Brendan.

436
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,739
Leaving everything else aside,
which we can't,

437
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,661
are you out of your mind?

438
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,914
You're gonna get yourself killed.

439
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,582
I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.

440
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,160
You got no business in the ring
with those animals.

441
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,753
Actually, I used to be one of those animals.

442
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,795
I fought for a living.

443
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:29,387
Guess I forgot to put that down
on my application.

444
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,182
Yeah, I guess you did.

445
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,647
Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just...

446
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,566
Look, look,
the school district is not gonna tolerate

447
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,736
teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

448
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,446
It was a parking lot of a strip club.

449
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,900
Wherever it was, you can't be doing it.

450
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,913
All right? I mean, this is a serious...
Shit, he's here.

451
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,365
This is a serious problem.

452
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:00,923
Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9/11.

453
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,544
What are we gonna do?

454
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,635
You say, "Yes, sir," and you say, "No, sir,"

455
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,684
and you say,
"It will never happen again, sir."

456
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,106
And then we just pray to God
that he's in a good mood.

457
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,442
UFC?

458
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,233
Yeah.

459
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,948
Son of a bitch.

460
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,582
-Superintendent Yorn. Good to see you, sir.
-Principal Zito.

461
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,685
What are you doing?

462
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,644
Well,

463
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:03,102
the girls have an important piano recital
in the morning.

464
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,988
And we have an equipment malfunction.

465
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,744
How'd it go?

466
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,700
They're gonna review your case
at the end of the semester.

467
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:22,288
But until then,
you're suspended without pay.

468
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,630
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

469
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,342
How the hell are we gonna pay
for an attorney?

470
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,599
He talked to me for free as a favor to Joe.

471
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,897
That's nice.

472
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,645
He said there's no precedent for this.

473
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,894
You'll be back by next semester.

474
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,979
The next semester?

475
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,745
Tess,

476
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,000
they have these smoker fights all over.

477
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:09,968
There's one in Lancaster next week,
there's two in Dover the week after.

478
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,172
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

479
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,019
That could keep us afloat.

480
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:25,313
You're gonna put yourself through this
over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

481
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,564
Some of them pay a lot more than that.

482
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,454
I would have to bounce for a month
to make what I made in two hours last night.

483
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,373
Yeah.

484
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,500
And these guys, they're not real fighters.

485
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,130
They're just guys that have seen
too much UFC on TV.

486
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,677
Now, if you have a better solution,

487
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,057
I'm all ears, but...

488
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,518
And what are we gonna tell the girls?

489
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,654
It'll be fine.

490
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,323
I'll just leave the house as usual,

491
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,447
except, only this time,
I'll be going to the gym.

492
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,084
The duck goes
quack, quack, quack, quack

493
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,972
And the cow goes
moo, moo, moo!

494
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:42,219
But that rooster
That rooster; he knew everything

495
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:47,854
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

496
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,731
Let's go, kiddo. Let's get moving.

497
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,277
Look what I found

498
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,984
in that disaster of a...

499
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,365
...basement

500
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,825
What do you say we sit down

501
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,044
and update this?

502
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:13,584
And you can fill me in
on how close you got to that record.

503
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:21,429
Did you continue wrestling
after you left with your mother?

504
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,227
Come on, Tommy. Tell me something.

505
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,314
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

506
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,024
You can take that back
to where you found it,

507
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,576
you can leave the coffee in the pot.

508
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,450
I can pour that myself.

509
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,998
And I can wake myself up, too.

510
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,049
Hurt my knees
coming up and down those stairs.

511
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,597
Yeah?

512
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:05,223
I'll leave the coffee pot on until 0500,
then I dump it.

513
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,316
I give command dismiss.
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

514
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,111
You can square your gear away.

515
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,909
Corporal Bradford, take this to CSC,
let them know we're back.

516
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,407
Roger, sir.

517
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,615
Detail, a-ten-hut!

518
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,580
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.
Sitrep, over.

519
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,797
What's up, Mark?

520
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,466
Here, sir. William's Company's back in.

521
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,589
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

522
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,341
-Did you see that? Oh, my God.
-What?

523
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,512
What's that?

524
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:45,309
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting tuned up
by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

525
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,851
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

526
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,395
Shit, Bradford,
the stuff you don't know amazes me.

527
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,224
-Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that?
-Wow. Oh, my God.

528
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,685
-Wait. Rewind that.
-Okay.

529
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,693
Right there, pause, pause, pause.

530
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,281
What's up, man?

531
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,490
Dude, what's his deal?

532
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,414
You're not gonna get your 11.

533
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,591
-AV, I need to see the tape.
-What tape?

534
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,593
-what tape?
-The tape!

535
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,924
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

536
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,342
Get the camera.

537
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,549
That's him.

538
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,808
That's him.

539
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,681
Let the music sink into you.
This is Beethoven.

540
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,267
I want you to breathe. I don't want
you boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

541
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,354
You listen to the music.
You relax, you breathe. One, two...

542
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,074
Again. One, two. One, two. One, two.

543
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,325
Good.

544
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,832
Good, good, good. Yos.

545
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,583
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it.
All right? Two more rounds.

546
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:48,969
Do I know you?

547
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,681
-Oh, man!
-Wow.

548
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,604
-Long time, brother. Too long.
-How you doing?

549
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,977
-Too long.
-Look at your place.

550
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,057
-You like?
-Yeah.

551
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,986
You see this beast? Marco Santos.

552
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,938
-He's training for Sparta.
-Yeah, right.

553
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,399
Not bad, right?

554
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,199
It's amazing, man.

555
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:11,075
Only the best. Move! Move! Move!
Move or die!

556
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,870
-You look good, brother.
-Thanks.

557
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,293
How are the girls?

558
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,216
Good. Yeah. I had another little one, Rosie.

559
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:28,297
I know. I know because Johnny C. told me
that she was in the hospital for a bit.

560
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,676
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

561
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,842
You know,

562
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,810
I was gonna call you
and then time went by and...

563
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,732
I'm a piece of shit. I should've called you.
I'm sorry.

564
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,808
-No. Come on.
-No.

565
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,479
Brendan, I'm sorry.

566
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,441
It's all good. She's good now.

567
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,491
-She's okay?
-So beautiful.

568
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:58,335
It's good to see you, man.
So everything's going great, huh?

569
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,831
Yeah.

570
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,291
Well, I've got a little problem.

571
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,337
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

572
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,172
-What?
-Yeah.

573
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,767
That's kind of why
I came to see you, actually.

574
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,608
You know, I got most of my dough
tied up in this joint,

575
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:23,856
but how much do you need?

576
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,774
I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.

577
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,614
I mean, I was hoping that

578
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,077
you would train me.

579
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,862
Train you for what?

580
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,282
I wanna get back in the cage.

581
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,617
Are you serious?

582
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,376
Come on, Brendan.

583
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,291
I won an event the other night.

584
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,424
You won an event. That's what this is.

585
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:54,178
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?
DJ from a local radio station,

586
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,761
a couple of ring card girls
you wouldn't bang on a dare? Am I right?

587
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,355
-Ish.
-Ish.

588
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,813
Brendan. I love you.

589
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,312
Why am I gonna train you?

590
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,986
When you were on the right side of 30,
you were barely a .500 fighter.

591
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,069
You never listened to me.

592
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:17,531
You don't listen to anyone.
These guys are animals.

593
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,710
You're a teacher, right?
What are you gonna do?

594
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,335
You're gonna come down here
a couple of days a week after detention?

595
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,009
You're gonna skip out
of the girls' volleyball game early?

596
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,009
I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue.

597
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:37,263
Parking lot thing kind of got me suspended.

598
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,817
I need to keep working the smokers.

599
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,273
Tess know about this?

600
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,778
Yeah?

601
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,077
'Cause the last time you fought,
I got read the riot act,

602
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,031
sitting in a hospital waiting room.
You remember that?

603
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,241
I was unconscious.

604
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:05,249
-You were more than unconscious.
-I was.

605
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,674
She's not gonna come down here
with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

606
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:13,424
It's not gonna happen.

607
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,550
What do you say, Frank?

608
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,424
What do I say?
What am I gonna say to you? "No"?

609
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,598
I mean, all my time
is wrapped up with Marco.

610
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,726
You know, you come down, I throw you
in a rotation, you spar with these guys.

611
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:29,403
But I can't promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

612
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:30,854
That's all I need.

613
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,189
Great. All right.

614
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,740
Yeah.

615
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,864
-I appreciate it.
-What, are you kidding me?

616
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,237
-You need anything, you call me.
-I will.

617
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,663
Let me know when you're coming down.

618
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,287
Well, I'm just gonna get
my stuff from the car.

619
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,701
Now?

620
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,855
Hey, Brendan.

621
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,237
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

622
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,073
What are you doing here?

623
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,291
I have some news for you.

624
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,210
Something wrong with your hands?

625
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,633
-No.
-If there's nothing wrong with your hands,

626
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,085
there's no reason for you not to phone.

627
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,716
-That's the deal.
-Yeah. I forgot.

628
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,843
The phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.

629
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,972
Hey, Brendan.
You ever seen my hands so steady?

630
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,644
Ever seen that?

631
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,398
I'm going inside.

632
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,817
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

633
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,312
Thousand days sober, today.

634
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,070
Well, that's great, Pop,
but it doesn't change anything.

635
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,275
What do you mean,
doesn't change anything?

636
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,444
Have a heart, Brendan.

637
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,909
You listen to me.

638
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:07,037
You take your "have a heart" bullshit
and you run it down the road.

639
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,207
Yeah, run it out with someone
that doesn't know you like I do.

640
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:14,632
All right, listen to me.
I thought maybe we could break bread.

641
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,927
You know,
just open some lines of communication.

642
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:23,263
You got two lines of communication.
You got the telephone and the post office.

643
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,763
God! Just 'cause you decide
it's a special day,

644
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,014
it doesn't make it one for me.

645
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,095
I've got a wife and kids inside,
and they're waiting for me,

646
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,852
so I don't have time for whatever this is.

647
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:33,731
I know you got a wife and kid in there.
I've got a granddaughter in there

648
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,607
I haven't seen in three years.

649
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,438
And another one I haven't even ever met.

650
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,529
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

651
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,531
Why is that?

652
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,660
Do you remember
having anything to do with that?

653
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,662
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

654
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,044
That shit you pulled.

655
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,457
Never again.

656
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,008
And all that shit I saw growing up,

657
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,633
-that doesn't happen here.
-Look...

658
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,053
Take care of yourself.

659
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,345
Tommy's back.

660
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,653
He's in the 'Burgh.

661
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,321
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

662
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,699
Yeah, he came to see me.

663
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,165
He came to see you?

664
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,911
Yeah. He's over at the house.

665
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,965
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's.

666
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,755
You remember Fitzy's?

667
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,711
It ain't Fitzy's anymore.

668
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,757
You and Tommy are training together?

669
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,508
Yeah.

670
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,519
-Tommy Conlon?
-Riordan.

671
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,605
-He's using your mother's maiden name.
-Yeah, I know what her name is.

672
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:58,403
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

673
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,529
I thought you came to break bread
over 1,000 days.

674
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,858
No, I did, Brendan, that's most important.

675
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,739
That, too.

676
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,281
All right. Did he say if he wants to see me?

677
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,701
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

678
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,794
He's just not that happy kid he was,
you know?

679
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,055
-Wow. Look at you.
-What?

680
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,302
Mr. Inside Man.

681
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,220
Inside? What?

682
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:33,354
You and Tommy training together like
nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

683
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,147
-Look...
-Now I know what you're really doing here.

684
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,644
-What's that?
-You came to gloat.

685
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,477
I did not come to gloat.
I came to get my son back.

686
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,733
Wow. There you go.
Yeah, you got your son back.

687
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,816
-No, I'm talking about you, Brendan. You.
-You got your son back.

688
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,663
You know...

689
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,455
Forget it.

690
00:49:55,659 --> 00:50:01,666
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part of the reason...
Part of the reason I stuck around,

691
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,843
'cause I thought I'd finally get you
all to myself.

692
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,807
But you didn't have any interest
in training me.

693
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,310
-You thought Tommy was the one.
-Brendan, I was a drunk.

694
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,434
I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.

695
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,515
Forget it.

696
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:23,154
You were always a frontrunner.
Never had any interest in the underdogs.

697
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,533
-But I was your son.
-You are my son, Brendan.

698
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,782
-Am I?
-Yeah, you are.

699
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,788
I'm just asking you if you can find...

700
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:42,958
Find a little bit of space in your heart
to forgive me a little bit.

701
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:49,298
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

702
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,347
-Okay.
-But I do not trust you.

703
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:59,057
Listen, tell Tommy, if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

704
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,398
-Okay. But they're not different things.
-All right?

705
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,399
You gotta trust to forgive.

706
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,480
Night, Pop.

707
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:07,690
My God.

708
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:11,778
Is that Emily? Jeez, she's grown, Brendan.

709
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,659
-Is that Rosie?
-Daddy, who is that?

710
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,082
It's just a nice, old man. Come on. Let's go.

711
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:19,081
How about a cup of coffee?

712
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,970
Huge news just broken here at ESPN

713
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:42,149
that Koba is coming to America
and will fight at Sparta-

714
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,936
Universally considered
the greatest pound-for-pound fighter

715
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,068
who ever lived, the mighty,
mythical Russian has never fought

716
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:50,400
on US soil in his legendary career

717
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,703
Slow to half guard.
Slow to half guard, hammer fist.

718
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:58,999
Now start on the other side.
And slip back in, there you go.

719
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,418
Tommy,

720
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,871
I got some news for you.

721
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,001
I got you into Sparta.

722
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,919
It took some doing,

723
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,051
but I made it happen.

724
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,092
You know thank you and 10% is customary?

725
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,366
Pilar? Hey, it's Tommy.

726
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,656
Tommy?

727
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,539
Okay. Sorry.

728
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:51,002
Good. I'm good. How are you doing?

729
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:55,264
Okay. You know me, Tommy.

730
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,762
I was getting really worried about you.

731
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,187
How's things? How are the kids?
The kids good?

732
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,515
Yeah, they're good.

733
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,563
-Maria 's getting so big.
-Yeah?

734
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,358
She looks more and more like Manny
every day.

735
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:15,864
-How's little man?
-He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

736
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,743
He's a real good boy.
He takes care of his sister.

737
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,120
-He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
-Good.

738
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,042
-We're good.
-Good.

739
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,709
You know...

740
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,756
Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute

741
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,964
what I promised you.

742
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,431
What I promised Manny.
I got opportunities coming up, so...

743
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,978
Whatever you can do, Tommy.

744
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,647
Help you guys out.
I'm gonna take care of you guys.

745
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:49,102
I know. Manny would really appreciate it.

746
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,733
-I wanna help you.
-You know what? You worry too much.

747
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,986
You worry so much about us. It's okay.

748
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,363
You know what? We're hanging in there.

749
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:01,323
”Captain Pollard once more sailed
for the Pacific in command of another ship,

750
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:05,626
”but the gods shipwrecked him again
upon unknown rocks and breakers.

751
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,955
”For the second time,
his ship was utterly lost,

752
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:12,383
”and forthwith forswearing the sea,
he has never tempted it since. 

753
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,345
Stop for a second. Listen to the music.
This is Beethoven.

754
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,512
Could you do another thing?
Or are you gonna do the same thing?

755
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:24,141
I need you to relax and listen.
Forget about how to lose the fight.

756
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,267
And two, and three.

757
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,977
With eight weeks left to Sparta,

758
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,855
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew

759
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,857
take time out from their international
press tour to join us.

760
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,610
J. J., we've never seen
this kind of Grand Prix tournament

761
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,693
in this country before.
Tell us, why the unique format?

762
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,704
Well, look, Jon, you know as well as anyone
that in mixed martial arts,

763
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,999
anyone can beat anyone on a given night.

764
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:46,826
But with this type of format,

765
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,544
it's gonna be tough
to deny who the champion is.

766
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,592
You got four fights in two nights,
16 fighters down to one,

767
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,384
winner's gonna be the last man standing.

768
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,428
Thirty-one. Thirty-two!

769
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,099
Breathe, breathe. Keep your eyes open.

770
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,889
You gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep moving. Keep moving.

771
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,723
Good! And listen to the music. You breathe.
He's getting it. He's getting it.

772
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,392
You see? You feel it? Feel the music.

773
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,523
-Come on!
-Nice.

774
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,522
Come on, baby!

775
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:20,109
...with Rashad Evans and Stephan Bonnar
and just five weeks left until Sparta,

776
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:24,197
as the hype continues for the war
on the shore this Fourth of July weekend

777
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,202
in Atlantic City. You know what that means.

778
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,034
The great Koba bringing his act stateside.

779
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:30,916
But I gotta ask you about the other guys.

780
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,964
What are they thinking,
entering a winner-take-all tournament

781
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,666
against a guy
that seemingly can't be beaten?

782
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,461
They're thinking $5 million
and $5 million seems a lot of money,

783
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:41,093
but they gotta remember one thing.
They're going against Koba.

784
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,549
Mission impossible, game over; go home.

785
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,305
Well, the winner takes home $5 million.

786
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:48,058
You can be sure
this will dominate the sports landscape

787
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:50,014
Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City.

788
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:54,147
The great Koba making his presence felt
in the United States.

789
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,694
Two... Come on, Tommy.

790
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,988
Hits you soft, right? Flow like water.

791
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,903
Get on your arm,
watch what's gonna happen.

792
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,152
There it is. Look, look, look.
He's going to sleep.

793
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,738
You train with the best
to be the best, Brendan.

794
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,787
Pittsburgh Beatdown has become
one of the most watched videos

795
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,588
on YouTube this year

796
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:18,008
Now joining us, via satellite,
is the victim of the infamous incident,

797
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,175
Mad Dog Grimes.

798
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:23,131
Mad Dog, what is your response
to all the hoopla surrounding the video

799
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,305
and Tommy Riordan?

800
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,930
This guy's a nobody.
It's a sparring session.

801
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,512
It is what it is,
and he's gonna pay for it next month

802
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:32,018
in Atlantic City.

803
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,358
Good. Always move. Always move.

804
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:37,858
I don't know, Marco. You're getting
a good game here from a physics teacher.

805
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,067
Good! Good.

806
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,908
You see? You see? Beautiful.

807
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:46,237
Top of the food chain.
He's the next champ, right here.

808
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,417
So, with Sparta now
just two short weeks away,

809
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:59,341
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew
return to the US

810
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:03,922
after a world tour that saw them visit
10 fighters in 10 different countries.

811
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,632
They stopped in Philadelphia today
to check in on renowned trainer;

812
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:07,849
Frank Campana,

813
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,678
and top contender; Marco Santos.

814
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,184
You gotta relax and stay calm in there.

815
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,140
The cage is your home.

816
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,646
You set the pace.

817
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,398
You set the rhythm.

818
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,487
Feel the Beethoven.

819
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:24,283
Be smarter than him, more patient.
Wait for him to make a mistake.

820
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,195
And when he does, that's your moment.

821
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,029
I see it. I see it. I see it.

822
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,454
No, he did not tap you!

823
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:36,295
Physics teacher!
That's the best in the business, son.

824
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,710
You can do this, Son!

825
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,543
Smoother There's more in you!
You got more in you!

826
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:43,718
We're not done yet!

827
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,638
He's beating you! He's beating you!

828
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,683
You better push harden Marco!
Brendan 's running away!

829
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,731
And the winner by tap out

830
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,650
”Irish?Brendan Conlon.

831
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:08,240
"...to each and every man in turn
but mirrors back his own mysterious self

832
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:13,324
"Great pains, small gains
for those who ask the world to solve them.

833
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,956
”It cannot solve itself "

834
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,353
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

835
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,773
-You wanna grab a bite?
-No. I'm gonna head home.

836
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,601
I gotta call the boys and break the news.

837
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,355
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Okay.

838
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,615
Coach!

839
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,506
Hey, I know this is not a really great time,

840
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,755
and it's too bad about Marco.

841
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,180
But how about me?

842
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,799
Are you talking about Sparta?

843
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,473
Yeah.

844
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,145
Brendan, you've got a better shot
at starting a boy band.

845
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,221
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

846
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,113
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

847
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,947
Which means anything could happen.
You know that as well as I do.

848
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,532
Yeah.

849
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,376
Come on. They'd have to kill me
to get me out of the cage.

850
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,288
That's what I'm afraid of.

851
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:44,874
Frank, I need this.

852
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,927
You're real tight with these guys.
You could call them.

853
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,844
You're the guy. They trust you.

854
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,846
Brendan.

855
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,897
You realize
what you're asking me to do here?

856
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,474
-Yeah .
-Yeah .

857
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,694
We go down to AC,
you get tapped out in five seconds.

858
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,567
How does that benefit either one of us?

859
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:10,866
-It's not gonna happen.
-Not gonna happen?

860
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,909
Wish I had a nickel
for every time somebody told me that.

861
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,200
It's not gonna happen.

862
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,129
I'll make a call.

863
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:42,272
I love my coach!

864
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:54,110
Yeah, they're good. The girls are good.
They're good.

865
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,285
Yeah, he should.

866
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,910
I mean, you've been spending
so much time with Brendan these days,

867
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:02,038
it's like you're part of the family
or something.

868
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,752
Yeah, he's right here. it's your boyfriend.

869
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,422
Frank. Hey, man.

870
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,761
That's unbelievable.

871
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,853
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thank you enough.
I don't know what to say.

872
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,612
All right, listen, I gotta call you back, okay?

873
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,491
All right. Bye.

874
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,365
I'm in.

875
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:44,744
-I'm going.
-Really?

876
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:49,373
That's your decision? You decided?

877
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,631
'Cause I really enjoyed the conversation
we just had

878
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,714
about making that decision together.

879
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:05,189
You told me you were gonna fight guys
that watched too much UFC.

880
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,482
I saw the Koba dude on the television,

881
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,480
and he's the guy they're watching.

882
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,526
It's a lot of money, Tess.

883
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:13,105
I don't give a shit about the money,
Brendan. I told you that.

884
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,358
We're gonna end up
cashing in your life insurance policy

885
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,909
before we pick up that prize money.

886
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,829
You don't think I can do it, right?

887
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,914
I think you could get killed.

888
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,000
-I'm not gonna get killed.
-You're not gonna get killed,

889
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,501
but you promised me
you're not gonna get hurt.

890
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,174
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

891
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,799
We have no prize money, we have no house.

892
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,926
-We have payments for hospital bills.
-Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

893
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,518
If I don't try in three weeks,
they're gonna take the house.

894
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,147
How's that for a promise?

895
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:54,028
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

896
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:57,358
But I'd really love it
if you'd be with me on this.

897
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,875
I'm not gonna watch you fight again,
I'm not.

898
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:09,373
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

899
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:42,736
Fourth of July weekend
doesn't officially get started until tomorrow,

900
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,288
but fight fans are already descending
on Atlantic City

901
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:49,209
for the Super Bowl
of mixed martial arts, Sparta!

902
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:52,083
We've got the dancing girls,
we've got the paparazzi,

903
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,584
we've got the red carpet!

904
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:57,167
And here comes J.J. Riley,
the man who started it all.

905
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,094
J.J., you've made a fortune
with your hedge funds.

906
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,884
You turned your back on Wall Street

907
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,307
and dedicated your life
to making Sparta happen.

908
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,636
Tell us why this tournament
is so important to you?

909
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:08,849
Growing up, we all wanted to know

910
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,148
who the toughest kid
in the neighborhood was, right?

911
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,065
I wanna know
who the toughest man on the planet is.

912
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,859
And that's why I put this thing together

913
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,734
That's what all these people are here to see,
come Saturday night.

914
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,156
-That's what we're gonna find out.
-Thank you, J.J.

915
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:24,953
And here 's something fans never thought
they'd see. Koba is here.

916
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,453
The legend arriving to fiight on US soil
for the very first time.

917
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,532
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

918
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,586
Olympic gold medalist in wrestling,
world Sambo champion,

919
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:35,460
undefeated in his mixed martial arts career.

920
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,633
Nobody's survived a round
with the Russian in five years.

921
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,211
He is the greatest fighter..."

922
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,020
I mean, you've seen our logos.

923
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,352
No, yeah, I've seen your stuff. It looks good.

924
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:57,986
I mean, is he fighting after Sparta?

925
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,155
I mean, we're trying to find
some info on him.

926
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,732
No, I'm not sure.

927
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,812
Hey, Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

928
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,609
You can't leave me like that.
They want to talk to you, not me.

929
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:39,811
-Frank Campana?
-Yeah.

930
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,612
Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

931
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,486
-Julia, how are you?
-Brendan Conlon?

932
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,408
-Yeah, hi. Hey.
-Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

933
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,700
-Right, hi. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

934
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,993
A few things I want to let you guys know.

935
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,993
-Press conference will start in 20 minutes.
-Okay.

936
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,245
Brendan, you're gonna be sitting up
on the stage.

937
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,621
Tommy!

938
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,836
Hey, Tommy! Where you going?

939
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,830
Can we stand with J.J.?

940
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,500
”Hearing the tremendous rush
of the sea-crashing boat,

941
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:05,554
"the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay.

942
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,883
”But in that evolution, catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship,

943
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,721
"seemingly seeing in it
the source of all his persecutions,

944
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:17,933
"bethinking it,
it may be a larger and nobler foe.

945
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:21,646
”Of a sudden,
he bore down upon its advancing prow,

946
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:25,653
"smiting his jaws
amid fiery showers of foam.

947
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,201
”Ahab staggered,
his hand smote his forehead.

948
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,029
"'l grow blind... "'

949
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,864
Now, the only person missing
from the event

950
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,450
was dark horse entry, Tommy Riordan

951
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:39,458
Recent revelations that Riordan
was not only a United States Marine,

952
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:43,417
but a hero in the Iraq Wan
has cast an even wider spotlight

953
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,094
on a fighter
who seems to have come out of nowhere.

954
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:49,264
Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's
Web testimony to Riordan,

955
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,808
who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq,

956
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,853
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media.

957
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,054
Tommy!

958
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,639
And the bridge just crumbled.

959
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:00,475
Tommy, come here.
Come on. You got to see this.

960
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:05,314
The amtrac was upside down
and water was coming in from everywhere.

961
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,447
And the water pressure was too much.
We couldn't get the back hatch open.

962
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,703
We were all drowning, man.

963
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,326
It was a death trap.

964
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,161
I couldn't have had more
than another minute.

965
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:20,207
Then suddenly,
the back ramp gets ripped off

966
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,960
There he was.

967
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,923
And before I could get out and thank him,
he was gone.

968
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,889
-He just vanished like a ghost.
-Tom my?

969
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:34,218
-Tommy, did you... Where you going?
-Taking a walk.

970
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:36,765
Tommy!

971
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:40,065
I really just wanted to say thank you.

972
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,352
You saved my life, brother

973
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:48,862
And anyone seeing this at Sparta,
anybody out in Pittsburgh,

974
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,820
you reach out to Tommy Riordan
and tell him Mark said, "Thank you."

975
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,826
Footage taken from a helmet cam
on the ground in Iraq

976
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,283
captured the heroic incident.

977
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,663
Hello?

978
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:01,244
Brendan?

979
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,754
Been looking all over for you.

980
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:49,342
How's it going?

981
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,135
It's going.

982
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:56,390
I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.

983
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,805
I don't drink coffee, man.
What do you want?

984
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,349
You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?

985
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,062
I'm good right here.

986
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,281
Okay.

987
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:21,833
Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed to know
I was never gonna see you guys again?

988
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,285
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

989
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,629
You had the information.

990
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,835
You chose the old man and the girl.

991
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,966
She wasn't just some girl.

992
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,345
I married her.

993
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,180
She's my wife.

994
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:45,436
See?

995
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,938
That's Tess.

996
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,395
That's Emily and Rosie.

997
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,606
They're your nieces, Tommy.

998
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,316
I don't know them.

999
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,245
I know you don't know them.
Of course you don't know them.

1000
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,873
So why am I looking at pictures
of people I don't know?

1001
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:04,959
'Cause that's my family.

1002
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,955
And who are you exactly?

1003
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,386
I'm your brother, man.

1004
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,092
You were in the Corps?

1005
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,052
What?

1006
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:25,389
-I said I didn't Know you were in the Corps.
-I wasn't in the Corps.

1007
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,816
Then you ain't no brother to me.

1008
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,402
My brother was in the Corps.

1009
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,654
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1010
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:37,196
I was a 16-year-old kid.
What the hell did I know?

1011
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:38,700
I don't know what you know.

1012
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,403
Why don't you go ask your girlfriend
about it?

1013
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,079
She's my wife, Tommy.

1014
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,450
So, that's it? I stay with Tess,
I never get to see you guys again?

1015
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,911
Not a single phone call? Nothing?

1016
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,915
God, man, I don't understand this.

1017
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,087
What? You...

1018
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:57,842
So, you won't forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

1019
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:04,177
No, he's just some old vet that I train with,
you know? He means nothing to me.

1020
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,606
And what I hear,
he means nothing to you, either.

1021
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:13,319
You got balls talking about forgiveness.

1022
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,146
That has nothing to do with forgiveness.

1023
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:18,028
I got children, man. I got a family to protect.

1024
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,109
Everything I do is for them.

1025
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,658
I forgave Pop.

1026
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,580
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1027
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,456
You forgave us?

1028
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,672
Yeah.

1029
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,762
Well, I'm not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

1030
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,931
You got some stones, man.

1031
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,600
I fell in love.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

1032
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:47,394
You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

1033
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,974
Mom needed you, I needed you.
You're my big brother. You bailed on me.

1034
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,903
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.
Everything worked out for you.

1035
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,024
God.

1036
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:59,734
You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?

1037
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,490
You leave, you get to bury people.

1038
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,492
You're not the only one
that suffered, Tommy.

1039
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,709
I didn't even know she was sick.

1040
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:14,839
I never even got the chance to say goodbye
to my own mother.

1041
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:21,384
You had no right to keep that from me.
That was not your decision to make!

1042
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,846
You know what?

1043
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,350
You walk around
with your pictures of your wife,

1044
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,727
and you're all, "I forgive you.

1045
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,351
"l forgive Pop.

1046
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:36,607
"l forgive everyone."

1047
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,188
Brendan, you know,

1048
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,695
you're full of shit.

1049
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,492
Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?

1050
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:13,022
You realize you're supposed to seek
my wise counsel

1051
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,225
while school's actually in session, right?

1052
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,231
-Yes, Principal Z.
-Tell him.

1053
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,608
Okay, we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend

1054
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,655
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1055
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,404
What do you say?

1056
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:25,156
So, you want to use the auditorium

1057
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,864
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for?

1058
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,198
-Right.
-Am I hearing this correct?

1059
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,158
Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,

1060
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,084
so it could turn into a fundraiser,
you know?

1061
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,208
You know,
I think you need to talk to your parents,

1062
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,415
because you guys might need
to be in summer school.

1063
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,920
-Everybody wants this.
-Come on, Mr. Zito.

1064
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,501
We've been telling everybody
about it already.

1065
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:42,585
-Exactly.
-And the gym's the only place

1066
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,966
-that's big enough to fit everyone.
-Look, it's never gonna happen.

1067
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:47,549
-What if we get a petition signed?
-We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1068
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,509
-The power of democracy.
-What are they gonna do about that?

1069
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,559
Mr. Z, please?

1070
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:53,684
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher, I really do,

1071
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,812
but there is nothing I can do for you.

1072
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:34,437
The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena.

1073
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:39,439
It might be Fourth of July weekend,
but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.

1074
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:43,738
This is Atlantic City.
This is the War on the Shore,

1075
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,737
and this is
what everyone's been waiting for

1076
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:51,663
Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period

1077
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,162
for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history.

1078
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:58,245
In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly,

1079
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,376
we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair

1080
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:06,757
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,
and take a ride on the Reading.

1081
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,965
Sparta is here!

1082
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,057
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1083
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:14,886
along with bestselling fight author,
Sam Sheridan.

1084
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,060
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,

1085
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,016
he wanted to create, quite simply,

1086
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:24,024
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history.

1087
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,319
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1088
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:29,821
J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is

1089
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,325
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen.

1090
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:35,202
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1091
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:39,627
As is the hoopla surrounding
one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1092
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,125
who has become an overnight sensation

1093
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,206
and captured the imagination
and attention...

1094
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,054
...Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,

1095
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,383
who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts' career

1096
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,227
Our rules of the cage are brought to you
by Tapout.

1097
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,940
-Five minutes, Paddy.
-Okay.

1098
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,571
It looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived,

1099
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:10,366
-because here comes Tommy Riordan.
-Wow!

1100
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,660
Tommy Riordan 's
captured the media 's attention,

1101
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,703
but the question still remains.

1102
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,156
Who is this guy?

1103
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,706
And more importantly,

1104
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,706
can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win?

1105
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,537
I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.

1106
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,341
And I say the fact that I don't know
is very strange.

1107
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,588
In an Internet age
where there are no secrets,

1108
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:30,545
this guy's a complete mystery.

1109
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,596
I can't find out anything about him.

1110
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,759
Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.

1111
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,429
Get your hands off me.

1112
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:42,769
Okay, let's go.

1113
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,145
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1114
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,104
No walk-out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.

1115
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:49,071
He skipped the press conference,

1116
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,524
wouldn't have his picture taken
for the program.

1117
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,359
He's breaking every rule.

1118
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,696
The only reason, really,
that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament

1119
01:16:56,779 --> 01:17:01,285
is an MMA video making the rounds of him
beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1120
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:04,086
But the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands

1121
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,754
is because of another video.

1122
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,504
It's even more stunning
than the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1123
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,334
This guy... Let me describe it to you, folks,

1124
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,712
for the few that haven't seen it,
and I don't know anybody who hasn't,

1125
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:16,345
but Tommy Riordan ripped the door
off a tank

1126
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:19,394
in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,

1127
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,436
and then walked away
without claiming a medal.

1128
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:22,855
-Listen...
-He ripped the door off a tank.

1129
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,807
Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.

1130
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:28,235
I'm not taking anything away from the guy,
he's a very, very tough guy,

1131
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,984
-but the tank don't hit back, you know.
-Sam...

1132
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,486
We've seen YouTube sensations fail
on a big stage before.

1133
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:36,035
Sam, he ripped the door off a tank!

1134
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,616
Tommy Riordan,
he has definitely got his hands full

1135
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,202
in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.

1136
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,753
-Francisco Barbosa...
-He's nothing to scoff at.

1137
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,546
Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.

1138
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,793
He's a very, very tough guy,
a very high-caliber fighter.

1139
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,549
Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,

1140
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:56,005
and I 'd imagine he's gonna disappear
just as quickly.

1141
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,089
It's a great story,

1142
01:17:57,173 --> 01:18:00,222
but I think your boy
is gonna be exposed here

1143
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,764
-as a YouTube sensation.
-Well, well,

1144
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,973
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall
hope you're wrong, Sam.

1145
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,232
All right, gentlemen,
you've been given your instructions.

1146
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,855
I expect a clean fight.

1147
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,277
Obey my command at all times,

1148
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,649
defend yourselves at all times.

1149
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,526
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1150
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,156
Tommy, cut off the corners,
feel this guy out,

1151
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:19,703
just like we know. Just like we know.

1152
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:22,658
We're about to get the big answer
to the big question.

1153
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,959
Is Tommy Riordan for real?

1154
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,253
-Gentlemen, you ready?
-They are both game fighters.

1155
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:29,080
-And here we go.
-You ready?

1156
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,297
Let's go to war!

1157
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,965
Keep your focus, Tom.

1158
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,793
And here we go. We're gonna see this.

1159
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,253
Barbosa's gonna be looking for a takedown.

1160
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,384
He's definitely looking for a takedown here.

1161
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:45,229
Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out!

1162
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:48,478
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.

1163
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:52,152
And now he's walking out of the cage.
He's leaving the cage.

1164
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,775
Hey, Tommy!

1165
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,948
There goes another rule, out the window!

1166
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,075
Where you going?

1167
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:01,200
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1168
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,952
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan.

1169
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,867
-A huge left hook, launching...
-Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1170
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:09,830
-... Tommy Riordan into the second round.
-One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1171
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,461
Good. Two, three.

1172
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,213
Good. Good, good, good.

1173
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:17,170
-Good. Come on. Good. One, two.
-Tommy Riordan is the real deal.

1174
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,348
-Showtime.
-All right. Come on, give me eight.

1175
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:26,016
Yes! That's my boy.

1176
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,644
Let's go, move your head around.

1177
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,609
You ready?

1178
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,820
Look at me.

1179
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:29,412
You can do this.

1180
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:37,796
I wanna hear you say it.

1181
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,427
I can do this.

1182
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,926
Let's go do this.

1183
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:49,888
Yeah.

1184
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,226
Yeah.

1185
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:07,872
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,
less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1186
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:10,826
And basically, he had to go on the road
to Frank Campana.

1187
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:13,002
Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,

1188
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,829
which is really something
I don't understand.

1189
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:16,880
I just... I'm shocked.

1190
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,008
Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.

1191
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,384
Go. Good luck.

1192
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,141
Let's go, Brendan.

1193
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,855
You go get him, Son!

1194
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:36,025
You know, I can understand
coming out to no music,

1195
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,650
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance?

1196
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,527
This is Beethoven.
This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.

1197
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,574
My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.

1198
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,783
Go get him, Son.

1199
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:51,456
If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,
you gotta talk about Frank Campana.

1200
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:54,581
Very unorthodox trainer,
but one of the best trainers in the game,

1201
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,915
and he's well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm,

1202
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:02,423
to remain patient,
and to remain composed under pressure.

1203
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:06,131
You know, I'll tell you, classical music
is about as fitting to this setting

1204
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:08,932
as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.

1205
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:10,434
-Come on.
-In fact, let me show you something.

1206
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,510
Right here. Let me tell you...

1207
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,015
-What?
-You see that, right there?

1208
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:16,941
That, right there...
That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1209
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:20,896
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about
to be dropped into a shark tank.

1210
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,230
He's a feeder fish.

1211
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,814
Come on, give the guy a break.

1212
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,241
You know, the guy...
At least we've seen him fight.

1213
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,785
I mean, he's fought real guys.
He's been in the UFC.

1214
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,829
-We remember him from that.
-I remember him, too.

1215
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,952
I remember him being very unmemorable.

1216
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:56,272
Midnight Le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work.

1217
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:57,393
When the brackets were announced,

1218
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,316
he thought he'd be going up
against Marco Santos.

1219
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:02,361
He's got to be thrilled to be seeing
Brendan Conlon across from him.

1220
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,530
Hey! You asked for it.

1221
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,908
Brendan retired from fighting
some years ago.

1222
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,577
He's actually
a high school physics teacher now,

1223
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,576
and Midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday.

1224
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,329
Well, he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson,

1225
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:19,753
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summer vacation.

1226
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:23,503
Midnight is known for talking trash,
he's also known for backing it up.

1227
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,550
No question, Bryan.
He's in a lot of trouble here.

1228
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:29,256
-Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.
-Gentlemen.

1229
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:33,259
Go get him.

1230
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,017
All right, guys,
you've been given your instructions.

1231
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,519
I expect a clean fight.

1232
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:43,102
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

1233
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,358
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1234
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,691
Go have some fun, baby.

1235
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,197
Gentlemen, you ready?

1236
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,875
You ready? Let's go to war!

1237
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:05,211
Work your kicks!

1238
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:09,754
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1239
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,714
Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.

1240
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:14,300
Let it out! Come on, move!

1241
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,188
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1242
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:21,682
In and out!

1243
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,565
Get off the fence!

1244
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:33,073
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1245
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:36,621
Get off the fence! Get off the fence!

1246
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,495
There he goes!

1247
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:40,918
Come on, Brendan. Get out of there!

1248
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:42,832
Come on!

1249
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:44,792
Get up!

1250
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,418
-Come on! Come on!
-Watch the back of the head!

1251
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,673
-Relax, you're okay. You're okay!
-Midnight is all over Brendan.

1252
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:53,255
Well, this can't last much longer.
This won't last much longer.

1253
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,761
The teacher just has no answers.

1254
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,843
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1255
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,642
-And now, he's got the hooks in.
-The hooks are in.

1256
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:03,770
-Brendan in very big trouble.
-The end is close.

1257
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:05,768
Can Brendan make the end of the round?

1258
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:07,690
Well, he's got the choke.

1259
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,362
-He's got 20 seconds left in the round...
-Come on.

1260
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,533
...and Conlon's face is turning purple.
This looks like it's over.

1261
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,906
Get up! Find his legs!

1262
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:16,862
Hips! Hip down!

1263
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,323
Hip down! Get your weight down!

1264
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:20,874
Get your weight down!

1265
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,418
Well, Midnight is squeezing
with all his might. He's got it very deep.

1266
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:26,087
-Ten seconds! Don't you tap!
-Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.

1267
01:25:26,205 --> 01:25:28,333
Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!

1268
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:29,875
Hold on, Brendan.

1269
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,460
Conlon doing his best to hang on,

1270
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,511
'cause his whole world's about to go
from day to night.

1271
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:35,840
Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!

1272
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,140
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1273
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,393
I thought for sure this guy
was going to sleep.

1274
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,022
Midnight can't believe it either, by the way.

1275
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,524
Jesus.

1276
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,946
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1277
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:59,906
You should've had him in the first round.

1278
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:04,160
Beautiful. Beautiful.
He doesn't know what hit him.

1279
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:06,086
He doesn't know what hit him. Breathe.

1280
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:07,834
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1281
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,294
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1282
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:12,718
Deep breath, deep breath.
I want you to do something.

1283
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,508
I want you to get him to pull, okay?

1284
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,340
When he pulls, I want you to hit him a bit
and I want you to shoot on him.

1285
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:21,518
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,
listening to Frank Campana right now

1286
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:22,640
and hear what he's saying in there.

1287
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,392
In and out. In and out. In and out.

1288
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:27,475
And I want you to trade punches
with him, all right? You're doing beautiful.

1289
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:30,436
Let's go, seconds out!

1290
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,736
Knock him out. Knock him out.
Knock him out.

1291
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:32,938
This round, knock him out.

1292
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,115
-Let's do it.
-He doesn't deserve to be here.

1293
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,158
Beautiful. Breathe.

1294
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,531
Let's go!

1295
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,249
And here we go. The teacher
answering the bell for round two.

1296
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:45,416
Nice and easy!

1297
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,453
Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!

1298
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,539
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1299
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:09,141
Circle around! Circle around!

1300
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:10,855
Nice and easy!

1301
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:13,396
Good, good!

1302
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,480
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1303
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:22,159
Get Out Of there! Hitch him! Hitch him!
Hitch him!

1304
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:25,957
Get out of there!
Get out of there! Get out of there! Come on!

1305
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,415
Do something.

1306
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,339
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1307
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,129
Shoot on him!

1308
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:38,970
Yes!

1309
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:41,140
Conlon shoots on Midnight Le
and gets him down.

1310
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,716
Midnight is trying to get to his...

1311
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,768
-Scissors takedown.
-A beautiful scissors takedown.

1312
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:47,721
-Really nice.
-Conlon showing signs of life

1313
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:49,602
and not backing down.

1314
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:50,898
Knees, knees!

1315
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,525
Good!

1316
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,732
Take his arm! Good!

1317
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:01,694
-He's got a kimura lock!
-He's got a very good kimura.

1318
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:05,122
Turn your hips in! In!

1319
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:08,167
Up! Stay with him. Turn your hips in!

1320
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:12,045
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1321
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,417
Turn your hips in!

1322
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:16,133
You got it, Brendan. Your round. You got it!

1323
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,377
Turn your hips up and in!

1324
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,553
Hips up! Very good!

1325
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,221
He's in a lot of trouble.

1326
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,140
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1327
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:27,186
-Wow! He's got it very, very deep.
-Midnight is in a very, very bad position.

1328
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,352
Midnight is in big trouble.

1329
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:31,398
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1330
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,100
Brendan Conlon is going
to finish it right here!

1331
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:35,026
Brendan Conlon has got
him in a very, very dangerous position

1332
01:28:35,102 --> 01:28:36,775
-and Midnight is in big trouble.
-Midnight...

1333
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,321
I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.

1334
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,482
You got it! You got it!

1335
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:44,073
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1336
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:47,702
And this isn't... This isn't happening!

1337
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:49,658
-This can't happen.
-It just did, Bryan.

1338
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:50,909
He tapped!

1339
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:53,044
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1340
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,589
-I can't believe that.
-Oh, my goodness!

1341
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,383
You got him! Way to go, Brendan!

1342
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,715
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1343
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,349
Honey, he tapped him out!

1344
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,561
He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!

1345
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:12,264
Way to go, Brendan! Way to go! Yeah!

1346
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:15,145
This is what's so great
about mixed martial arts.

1347
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:16,977
There's so many ways to lose.

1348
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:21,406
One tiny miscalculation,
anyone can win at anytime.

1349
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,904
Which is probably why Frank Campana's
embracing his man.

1350
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:28,785
And I honestly don't think either
one of them can believe what just happened.

1351
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,333
Great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher.

1352
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:34,082
Well, that's a hallmark
of Frank Campana's philosophy,

1353
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:35,788
something all his fighters buy into,

1354
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,839
and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.

1355
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,632
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1356
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,710
He thought he'd get a free pass
into the second round,

1357
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,090
but, instead, he's going home.

1358
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:47,391
Dominated the fight the entire way,
but he falls prey to a very technical finish.

1359
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:49,514
A very technical finish, but that's a fluke.

1360
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,561
-I don't care what anybody says. That is a...
-I don't know.

1361
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,480
You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna call it
a guy maintaining composure

1362
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,399
and waiting for his opportunity.

1363
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:00,646
Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!

1364
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:04,274
I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.

1365
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:28,386
Yes!

1366
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,259
Okay.

1367
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:45,357
We 're down to eight fighters,
and soon to be seven,

1368
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,239
as Koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight.

1369
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,866
-Right hand.
-Huge right hand.

1370
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,327
-Huge right hand.
-Oh, my goodness.

1371
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,754
Oh, my God! This is over.

1372
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:00,751
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

1373
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,716
You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid
he might have broken something else.

1374
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,169
That's certainly possible.

1375
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,716
Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

1376
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,798
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

1377
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:13,560
Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.

1378
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:15,387
Like a man with something to prove,

1379
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:19,475
reminding everyone why he is a
serious contender to win this whole contest.

1380
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:23,813
He wanted to send a message to
Tommy Riordan, and there it is, right there.

1381
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,569
Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.

1382
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:29,071
The teacher miraculously
passed his first test,

1383
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,652
but now he's got to face The Dane.

1384
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:33,284
Brendan! You can do it.

1385
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,873
Halfway through round three, now,
and the beating continues.

1386
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:43,002
I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon
can take this kind of punishment.

1387
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:45,004
He has been battered without mercy

1388
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,551
-in both of his fights today.
-Relax! You're okay!

1389
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,299
He's still standing, Bryan.

1390
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:51,465
Beethoven!

1391
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,141
No! No, no, no!

1392
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:56,428
Good, take him down!

1393
01:31:57,804 --> 01:31:59,431
Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!

1394
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:00,561
Hold on to him.

1395
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,276
He's looking for that arm.
He's looking for the armbar.

1396
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,194
-He's got an armbar.
-He's got that armbar.

1397
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,068
He's looking to be boss of it, once again.

1398
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:08,694
Tap, tap, tap! Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1399
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:12,031
Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!

1400
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:14,204
He's got that arm, Sam!

1401
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,785
-Break, break, break, break!
-Yes!

1402
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:17,912
Are you kidding me?

1403
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:19,789
Yes!

1404
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,246
Do it once, it's a fluke.
Do it twice, and it's something else.

1405
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:25,629
Pull the bandwagon over,
I think I am hopping on.

1406
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:27,300
I think I'm a believer.

1407
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:30,212
You did it! Way to go, Brendan!

1408
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,925
-I'm doing this!
-Okay.

1409
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,222
-I'm doing it!
-Okay.

1410
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:34,515
Okay, Son.

1411
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:38,179
The crowd catching fire
for the hero Tommy Riordan.

1412
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:41,473
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1413
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:44,184
He doesn't seem to want
anything to do with all this adulation.

1414
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:45,985
He's just here to fight.

1415
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:48,530
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1416
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,073
Gentlemen, you ready?

1417
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:52,154
Are you ready?

1418
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,452
-Let's go to war!
-Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1419
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,660
Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!

1420
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,499
-Yeah.
-He is all over Diego Santana.

1421
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:08,751
He's swarming all over him,
and now he's beating on him without mercy!

1422
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:09,876
Oh, my goodness!

1423
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:21,555
There he goes again,
storming out of the cage!

1424
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:24,482
Tommy Riordan marching off
through the crowd

1425
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:28,232
and straight into the final four,
ladies and gentlemen.

1426
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:30,939
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1427
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,851
-So where is he?
-Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1428
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:02,179
Make a right at that white sign...

1429
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:14,487
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1430
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:24,993
I know that that other thing is

1431
01:34:27,454 --> 01:34:30,048
bothering the hell out of you.

1432
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:33,631
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

1433
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:37,218
What you did for that kid in the tank,

1434
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:40,012
that was really something.

1435
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:45,264
How about deserting my unit?

1436
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:49,025
Is that really something, too?

1437
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:53,397
Yeah.

1438
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:58,194
I was on my way out of the country
when I came across those guys.

1439
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:00,825
What was I supposed to do?
Let them drown?

1440
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,030
No.

1441
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:07,619
-What did you do?
-What did I do?

1442
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:11,839
I took off.

1443
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,595
That's why you go by Riorolan.

1444
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:22,051
That's why they can't
find your service records.

1445
01:35:25,345 --> 01:35:28,144
What the hell happened over there, Tommy?

1446
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:31,192
That is none of your business, man.

1447
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:34,111
Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.

1448
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:36,656
I've done it, I've seen it.

1449
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,324
You can trust me. I understand.

1450
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:41,448
Will you spare me the
compassionate father routine, Pop?

1451
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,580
The suit don't fit.

1452
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:46,578
Tommy.

1453
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,540
I'm really trying here.

1454
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:53,127
-You're trying?
-Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1455
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:54,374
Now?

1456
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,387
Where were you when it mattered?

1457
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:04,434
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.
I don't need you now.

1458
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:08,601
You know, it's too late now.
Everything's already happened.

1459
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:12,692
You and Brendan
don't seem to understand that.

1460
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:16,317
Let me explain something to you, okay?

1461
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:19,696
The only thing that I have in common
with Brendan Conlon

1462
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,651
is that the pair of us,

1463
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:25,538
we have absolutely no use for you.

1464
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:31,453
Look at you.

1465
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:35,253
Yeah, I was right.

1466
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:38,051
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

1467
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:40,254
At least you had some balls then,
not like now,

1468
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:44,512
tiptoeing around,
like some beggar with your cup out.

1469
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:49,521
Take it somewhere else.
In fact, you know what?

1470
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:50,643
Here's a cup.

1471
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:54,101
Why don't you take this and go get yourself
some more of your shitty tapes...

1472
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,060
-Don't do this, Tommy.
-...and you go back to the room

1473
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:57,817
-and you listen to some more...
-Don't do this.

1474
01:36:57,896 --> 01:37:01,400
...fish stories that no one gives a shit about.
Now get out of here.

1475
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:05,495
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1476
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:46,323
God pity them!

1477
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:49,406
All shall perish except me!

1478
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:56,959
Bastards. Bastards!

1479
01:37:58,206 --> 01:38:01,210
You bastards. You bastards!

1480
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:04,800
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1481
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:07,223
Ishmael. God pity them.

1482
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:11,349
Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.

1483
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,148
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1484
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:18,901
Ahab.

1485
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:22,071
You godless son of a bitch!

1486
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:24,023
You stop the ship!

1487
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:27,236
You godless son of a bitch!

1488
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:31,330
"'The whale! The ship! '
cried the cringing oarsmen.

1489
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:33,408
"'Oars! Oars! Slope downward...

1490
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:34,708
Stop it.

1491
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:37,458
?O sea that ere it be for ever too late,

1492
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:40,962
"Ahab may slide this last,
last time upon his mark!"'

1493
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,172
Captain...

1494
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:47,301
Stop the...

1495
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:49,678
Captain, stop...

1496
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,101
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1497
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:55,596
For the love of God.

1498
01:38:56,723 --> 01:38:58,316
They're lost.

1499
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,273
Stop it... The ship.

1500
01:39:05,273 --> 01:39:06,490
Ahab...

1501
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:11,279
You stop the...

1502
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,247
Oh, no.

1503
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,754
-Come on, give me the Walkman.
-No.

1504
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:26,052
-No, no.
-Come on.

1505
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:28,004
Come on, come on.
Come, give me the bottle.

1506
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:30,055
Come here, come here, come here.

1507
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:32,475
-Come on. Give me.
-No.

1508
01:39:42,769 --> 01:39:44,112
Tommy.

1509
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,822
We're lost.

1510
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:50,318
We're lost, Tommy.

1511
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:55,115
It's over. We'll never make it back.

1512
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:59,710
-Stay down.
-We'll never make it back.

1513
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:11,882
I'm here.

1514
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,351
I always loved you.

1515
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,894
You know that, don't you, Tommy?

1516
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,483
I always loved you.

1517
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:31,401
You and your brother. My two boys.

1518
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:50,216
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1519
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:07,361
Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel
without his trainer.

1520
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:14,577
Once again, no walk-out music.

1521
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,241
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1522
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:28,299
Bryan, it sounds like V-J day
in Times Square.

1523
01:41:28,374 --> 01:41:30,376
I've never seen anything like this.

1524
01:41:47,643 --> 01:41:50,362
Tommy acknowledging his comrades
for the first time

1525
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,611
and climbing into the cage.

1526
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:59,531
Mad Dog Grimes has been
waiting for revenge

1527
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:02,333
ever since the day Tommy Riordan
walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1528
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,251
and turned his life upside down.

1529
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:08,048
It's been a very long and very miserable
few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.

1530
01:42:09,582 --> 01:42:14,053
Grimes mocking Riordan by having
a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1531
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:17,428
and the Marines are really
letting Mad Dog have it.

1532
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,478
All right, gentlemen.

1533
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,688
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1534
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,065
I expect a clean fight.

1535
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,068
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1536
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,024
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1537
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:36,984
It's not gonna happen again.

1538
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:42,116
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.
He can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.

1539
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:43,620
He predicted an early knockout.

1540
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:46,418
He said he was gonna
take Tommy out with one punch.

1541
01:42:46,494 --> 01:42:49,043
And by the way, he said,
"They're gonna have to pull me off him."

1542
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:52,000
We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.

1543
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:55,003
Gentlemen, you ready?

1544
01:42:55,628 --> 01:42:56,845
You ready?

1545
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:00,975
-Let's go to war!
-Here they go and they are off!

1546
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,933
Tommy tackles him, and he's on top!

1547
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:06,685
He's raining bombs!

1548
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:09,187
-Cover up!
-Come on, work it.

1549
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:11,895
-Raining bombs.
-Mad Dog is out.

1550
01:43:11,978 --> 01:43:14,106
Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.

1551
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,690
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1552
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,740
Break! Break! Break!

1553
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:24,286
That's the fastest knockout I think
I've ever experienced!

1554
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:27,835
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
He is not moving.

1555
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:33,341
You do that to someone on the street,
they lock you up and throw away the key.

1556
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:35,009
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

1557
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:37,837
This guy's walking away from the cage
like he's leaving a crime scene!

1558
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,094
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1559
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:49,725
-Everybody through. Come on, move it out.
-Sparta!

1560
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,658
Yeah!

1561
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:06,157
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1562
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,662
I'm on your side.

1563
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:18,253
Let's go.

1564
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:21,388
-Principal Zito, there he is.
-Nice.

1565
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:27,099
Let's go, Brendan.

1566
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:34,061
Brendan Conlon came into this tournament
as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1567
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:36,362
and now here he is in the final four.

1568
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:40,032
The crowd snowing their appreciation.
He's getting quite the reception.

1569
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:44,032
He's got a huge reception.
I mean, this guy shocked everybody.

1570
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:47,247
Come on, come on. You all right?

1571
01:44:49,658 --> 01:44:51,501
You've got a visitor.

1572
01:44:53,704 --> 01:44:55,672
Second row, 10 o'clock.

1573
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,383
You all right with that?

1574
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,351
I love you.

1575
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:17,028
And here comes the great Russian, Koba.

1576
01:45:17,103 --> 01:45:20,824
Koba is so intimidating
and his reputation is larger than life.

1577
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:24,152
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

1578
01:45:29,448 --> 01:45:32,918
I want you to look right at him
when he comes in here. Look right at him.

1579
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:35,712
All right? Don't take your eyes off him.

1580
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:05,238
I'm proud of you, brother.

1581
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,578
This is your cage.

1582
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,795
Gentlemen.

1583
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:30,263
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1584
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:31,810
I expect a clean fight.

1585
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:34,639
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1586
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:37,271
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1587
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:43,819
Should I be nervous for Brendan?
'Cause I am.

1588
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:46,071
I wanna stop the fight
before it even gets going.

1589
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:49,245
-Well, here we go.
-He's like a machine. Look at him.

1590
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:53,579
Gentlemen, you ready?

1591
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:55,792
You ready? Let's go to war!

1592
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:57,370
Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.

1593
01:46:57,453 --> 01:47:01,378
But now, the question is, how long
can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1594
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:02,754
Angle out of it!

1595
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:06,254
Keep moving!

1596
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:10,341
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1597
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:16,848
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get away from him!

1598
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,649
Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!

1599
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:22,774
-Crushing body shots.
-Relax, you're okay.

1600
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,776
Conlon's down,
and Koba pounces and starts pounding!

1601
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:26,232
Get up! Get up!

1602
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:28,283
He's just pounding on him
like a side of beef.

1603
01:47:28,526 --> 01:47:29,903
Go, go, go. Get up!

1604
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:31,908
He's getting his ass whooped.

1605
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:36,208
And now he's got him in the air!

1606
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,956
Oh, God.

1607
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:40,288
Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!

1608
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:46,302
I think Campana has to think
seriously about...

1609
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:48,721
-How much abuse can one man take?
-...continuing another round of this.

1610
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:49,922
Go to war!

1611
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:57,476
Just relax! Relax! Relax! Off the fence!

1612
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:01,810
Brendan's going for a ride!

1613
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:04,486
That one shook the entire building!

1614
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:08,524
Man, he just threw him against the fence
like a rag doll.

1615
01:48:08,607 --> 01:48:12,407
Get up! Get up! Come on!
Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!

1616
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:14,204
And now he's on top! Koba's on top,

1617
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:17,250
and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.
On the edge of blowing it.

1618
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:19,247
Get off the fence, Brendan!

1619
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:22,000
You wonder how Conlon can
take this kind of beating on his arms.

1620
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:25,174
-His forearms and his hands.
-Drop that neck!

1621
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:26,751
How much can one man take?

1622
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:29,136
Break! Break! Break!

1623
01:48:31,422 --> 01:48:33,641
Everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned

1624
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:36,469
about Brendan Conlon's bravery
getting him in trouble here.

1625
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:38,520
His bravery could get him killed, frankly.

1626
01:48:38,596 --> 01:48:40,769
And by the way,
he's got nothing more to prove.

1627
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:42,646
-He's lasted two rounds with Koba
-That's true, that's true.

1628
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:44,853
And you wonder what's keeping this guy up.

1629
01:48:45,978 --> 01:48:47,901
Sit down. Sit down.

1630
01:48:49,023 --> 01:48:50,650
Breathe. Breathe!

1631
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:53,486
Look at me. Look at me!

1632
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:56,869
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.
Hold it, small sips.

1633
01:48:59,908 --> 01:49:02,286
Why are we here?
Why are we here, Brendan?

1634
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:03,837
Why are we here?
Are we here to win this fight?

1635
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:05,164
Are we here to win this fight?

1636
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:07,921
You tell me.
'Cause if we're not, I will throw in the towel.

1637
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,968
We will get Tess and we will go home.

1638
01:49:10,044 --> 01:49:12,046
We'll go home, okay?

1639
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:15,049
You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.

1640
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:17,097
Do you understand me?

1641
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:20,934
You don't knock him out,
you don't have a home.

1642
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,390
Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!

1643
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:44,920
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1644
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:52,633
Conlon somehow
answering the call to round three.

1645
01:49:52,711 --> 01:49:55,134
And Koba's all over him once again.

1646
01:49:58,217 --> 01:49:59,434
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1647
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,353
I mean, there's signs of life
in Brendan Conlon.

1648
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:03,768
He's starting to mix it up.

1649
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:13,274
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1650
01:50:16,068 --> 01:50:18,446
He's taking Koba down,
but the Russian's back up.

1651
01:50:19,238 --> 01:50:21,036
Brendan shoots him again,
pressing him against the cage.

1652
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,868
-Yes!
-Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1653
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,828
Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,

1654
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:27,879
and Koba now squeezing his neck
for all it's worth,

1655
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:28,956
trying to choke the teacher out.

1656
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:31,883
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!

1657
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:33,961
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1658
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:36,551
Conlon looking for a way out.

1659
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:39,474
-What is this?
-Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1660
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:42,224
He just shook off a guillotine
and tossed Koba.

1661
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:44,521
Conlon's looking for an armbar.
He's looking for that armbar,

1662
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:47,145
-and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.
-Hips, hips, hips!

1663
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:48,601
Yeah, you got him!
You got him! You got him!

1664
01:50:49,226 --> 01:50:51,024
Koba slips right out.

1665
01:50:51,562 --> 01:50:54,486
Conlon's staying after him.
He's squeezing the bear.

1666
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:58,285
The tables have turned and the boy scout
is actually messing with the bear.

1667
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:00,488
The teacher springing off the fence and
going for a mountain,

1668
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:01,572
-but Koba's on his feet.
-Get up, get up!

1669
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:03,157
He does not want to be
on the ground with Brendan

1670
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,242
and his endless bag of submissions.

1671
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:08,750
Koba trying to reestablish his dominance
with brutal shots to the face.

1672
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:11,753
But Conlon's showing no fear.
This is a fight!

1673
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,085
We have got ourselves a fight!

1674
01:51:17,838 --> 01:51:20,091
Wow, that's a huge elbow to the head.

1675
01:51:20,174 --> 01:51:22,427
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.
He's got it very deep!

1676
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:24,511
He's got it very, very deep!

1677
01:51:24,845 --> 01:51:25,937
He's deep on that.

1678
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,102
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1679
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:29,980
We saw this with Midnight,
we saw it against The Dane,

1680
01:51:30,058 --> 01:51:31,776
and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...

1681
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:34,651
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1682
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:36,777
Not letting out!

1683
01:51:36,857 --> 01:51:38,951
Conlon wrenching that knee
for all it's worth.

1684
01:51:39,026 --> 01:51:40,778
He's putting everything he has into it.

1685
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:44,623
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1686
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:45,699
Koba taps.

1687
01:51:45,783 --> 01:51:48,206
Koba has tapped!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1688
01:51:48,285 --> 01:51:52,085
I can't believe it!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1689
01:51:52,164 --> 01:51:54,758
He's tapped Koba!

1690
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:57,586
And Frank Campana can't believe it.

1691
01:51:57,669 --> 01:52:00,218
This whole place can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

1692
01:52:00,297 --> 01:52:03,517
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.

1693
01:52:04,176 --> 01:52:07,726
-Tess!
-You got it! You did it!

1694
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:11,105
Brendan taps the world Sambo
champ with a knee bar!

1695
01:52:11,183 --> 01:52:12,810
-Babe, you did it!
-Brendan Conlon!

16968,479
Are you ready?

1747
01-I don't know what to say. It's amazing!
-I don't know what I just saw.

1697
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:17,902
I just don't know
how to put this into context.

1698
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:20,825
That's gotta be the biggest upset
in MMA history.

1699
01:52:20,901 --> 01:52:22,995
I have never seen anything like this.

1700
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:26,540
He tapped a world Sambo champion
in a knee bar!

1701
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:31,667
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!

1702
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:35,591
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1703
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:37,839
He's done the impossible.

1704
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:41,388
He has done the impossible.
He's pulled off a miracle.

1705
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,601
This place is going crazy
because they've just seen a miracle.

1706
01:52:57,396 --> 01:52:59,899
This is CNN Breaking News.

1707
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:04,362
A surprising turn in the story
of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.

1708
01:53:04,945 --> 01:53:07,949
CNN has learned that Riordan's true identity

1709
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:10,875
is that of Marine Staff Sergeant
Thomas Conlon,

1710
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,830
who went AWOL from his unit
earlier this year;

1711
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:16,791
following the friendly fire death
of his brother-in-arms,

1712
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:18,251
Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

1713
01:53:18,584 --> 01:53:21,463
Fernandez's wife, Pilar Fernandez,
spoke with me

1714
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:24,173
in an exclusive interview, moments ago.

1715
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,766
The bombs started dropping.

1716
01:53:27,509 --> 01:53:30,388
They were coming from US planes.

1717
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:34,316
Tommy and Manny were waving their Hags

1718
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:37,736
to let them know they were Americans,

1719
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:39,438
but they didn't stop.

1720
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:42,483
Everyone died.

1721
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:45,114
Everyone except Tommy.

1722
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:49,414
And, you know, my Manny used to say,

1723
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,662
that Tommy was the brother he never had.

1724
01:53:55,329 --> 01:53:59,300
Conlon, who is fighting in the mixed
martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,

1725
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:02,753
is expected to be taken into custody
by military police,

1726
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:05,965
following tonight's winner-take-all finale
in Atlantic City.

1727
01:54:06,048 --> 01:54:10,428
If victorious, he has pledged
his $5 million purse

1728
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,387
to the widow of his fallen comrade.

1729
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:16,099
We've just got some incredible news,

1730
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:18,857
that I'm having trouble
putting into context, but here it is.

1731
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:23,111
The two men
fighting for the championship tonight,

1732
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:25,363
for the $5 million prize,

1733
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:28,954
for the middleweight championship
of the world,

1734
01:54:29,029 --> 01:54:30,531
are brothers.

1735
01:54:56,723 --> 01:54:58,976
All right, let's get this off.

1736
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:18,078
What are you gonna do?

1737
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:24,710
I'm gonna fight him.

1738
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:39,000
-Mr. C, Mr. C!
-Mr. C, Mr. C!

1739
01:57:24,746 --> 01:57:27,920
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1740
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:27,609
Gentlemen.

1741
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:36,864
Gentlemen, this is the final.
I expect a clean fight.

1742
01:58:36,943 --> 01:58:40,038
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1743
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:41,911
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1744
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:43,412
Where's Pop?

1745
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:05,805
Gentlemen, are you ready?

1746
01:59:07,057 --> 01:59:08,479
Are you ready?

1747
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:10,981
Let's go to war!

1748
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,999
Relax, Brendan, relax!

1749
01:59:29,037 --> 01:59:30,664
Get out! Get out of there!

1750
01:59:32,165 --> 01:59:33,838
Throw your hands!

1751
01:59:35,126 --> 01:59:37,094
Throw your hands!

1752
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:39,264
Don't lose it. No, no, no!

1753
01:59:39,339 --> 01:59:40,841
Move! Move!

1754
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:46,183
Tie him up! Tie him up!
Control his moves. Control his moves.

1755
01:59:46,596 --> 01:59:49,065
Control the arms!
Keep control in the arms! Breathe!

1756
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:52,523
You're okay! Relax! Breathe!

1757
01:59:58,358 --> 02:00:00,531
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1758
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,533
Relax! Breathe!

1759
02:00:02,862 --> 02:00:05,786
Tie him up! Get up!
Tie him up, Brendan! Tie him up!

1760
02:00:06,491 --> 02:00:07,868
Come on. Get him! Get him! Get him!

1761
02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:10,211
Break!

1762
02:00:10,453 --> 02:00:11,705
What was that?

1763
02:00:11,788 --> 02:00:13,210
Hey, come on, Josh!

1764
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:14,548
What's up with that?

1765
02:00:14,874 --> 02:00:16,626
Hey, step back!

1766
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:18,257
Watch that late blow!

1767
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:20,214
Come on!

1768
02:00:28,388 --> 02:00:30,311
Come on, Josh! I mean, what is that?

1769
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:32,563
Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1770
02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:34,440
Sit... Brendan, sit down.

1771
02:00:34,519 --> 02:00:36,613
Look at me. Sit down.

1772
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,403
Brendan, look at me. Look at me.

1773
02:00:40,608 --> 02:00:44,988
Look at me, Brendan. Let it go.
Let it go, okay?

1774
02:00:45,071 --> 02:00:47,620
Breathe. Beethoven.

1775
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:51,620
Okay. He's coming right at you, right?
Exactly like we planned.

1776
02:00:51,703 --> 02:00:54,832
I want you to angle out,
hit and move every time. All right?

1777
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:56,211
-Angle out and move.
-Good.

1778
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:58,760
Breathe. Breathe. Come on, relax.

1779
02:01:00,837 --> 02:01:03,681
-Okay. He's not your brother, right?
-Time's up!

1780
02:01:03,757 --> 02:01:05,600
Look at me. He's not your brother, right?

1781
02:01:05,675 --> 02:01:06,767
-All right.
-He's in the way.

1782
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:09,229
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

1783
02:01:09,304 --> 02:01:11,727
Taking a little more time for the cheap shot.

1784
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:16,110
Do your job, Josh.

1785
02:01:21,232 --> 02:01:22,609
Come on, babe. Come on.

1786
02:01:22,776 --> 02:01:24,369
Let's go to war.

1787
02:01:24,444 --> 02:01:25,445
Breathe!

1788
02:01:30,617 --> 02:01:32,836
Pace, pace! Control the pace!

1789
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:44,130
Cover up!

1790
02:01:45,048 --> 02:01:47,392
Come on, get off the fence!

1791
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:48,639
Get off the fence!

1792
02:01:49,469 --> 02:01:50,686
Hands up! Hands up!

1793
02:01:52,138 --> 02:01:55,062
Head up! You're all right! Relax! Breathe!

1794
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:58,152
Yeah!

1795
02:02:04,651 --> 02:02:05,652
Get him!

1796
02:02:08,655 --> 02:02:11,704
-Huge throw. Huge.
-Look at that.

1797
02:02:11,783 --> 02:02:13,410
Turn in! Don't give him your back!

1798
02:02:13,493 --> 02:02:15,166
Turn in! Go! Good! Good!

1799
02:02:18,289 --> 02:02:20,417
Come on, get out of it! Go! Get up!

1800
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:23,382
Control the arms! Control the arms!

1801
02:02:25,755 --> 02:02:28,304
Cover up, cover up. Push it!

1802
02:02:30,009 --> 02:02:31,511
Break free! Break! Break!

1803
02:02:33,263 --> 02:02:36,142
Good, good, good!
Clean break! Stop! Hey, stop!

1804
02:02:36,224 --> 02:02:37,851
-Come on.
-Here we go, mom.

1805
02:02:37,934 --> 02:02:41,484
Time to lock up your china,
the boys are at it again!

1806
02:02:47,444 --> 02:02:48,536
Let's go to war!

1807
02:03:06,504 --> 02:03:08,427
Now! Get up! Get up!

1808
02:03:09,424 --> 02:03:10,971
Get up! Come on, babe!
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1809
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:12,893
Control it! Control it with the arms.

1810
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:14,516
Switch! Switch!

1811
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:17,982
Hips!

1812
02:03:18,516 --> 02:03:20,268
Down, down. Hips down.

1813
02:03:24,063 --> 02:03:27,317
Oh, my God. That's a deep omoplata there.
He's got the seats up.

1814
02:03:28,735 --> 02:03:30,408
Come on, Tommy!

1815
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,498
You've got him, babe! You've got him, babe!
Come on, tap him out!

1816
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:39,370
Tom!

1817
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:48,130
Break! Break! Break!

1818
02:03:48,213 --> 02:03:50,762
Tommy, you okay?

1819
02:03:55,261 --> 02:03:57,764
-Tommy!
-Go! Let's go! Go!

1820
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,269
Calm down. Calm down.

1821
02:04:00,308 --> 02:04:02,857
-It's the championship. Keep it together.
-All right. All right. I got it.

1822
02:04:02,936 --> 02:04:04,438
Sit down. Sit down!

1823
02:04:11,903 --> 02:04:13,701
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1824
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:17,000
-I popped his shoulder.
-Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

1825
02:04:17,075 --> 02:04:18,702
-I heard it tear.
-You popped his shoulder?

1826
02:04:18,785 --> 02:04:19,832
-Yeah.
-Good. Okay.

1827
02:04:19,911 --> 02:04:22,539
I want you to pop his other shoulder.
Let's go.

1828
02:04:22,622 --> 02:04:24,499
-Josh.
-Hey, hey, no Josh.

1829
02:04:24,582 --> 02:04:25,708
-Josh.
-Hey!

1830
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:27,214
-Look at me. Look at me.
-What?

1831
02:04:27,293 --> 02:04:29,091
All right, you got two rounds. Two rounds.

1832
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:30,467
We need both rounds.

1833
02:04:33,216 --> 02:04:34,308
What?

1834
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:37,479
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1835
02:04:44,018 --> 02:04:47,147
Go in there, you kick him in the head,
take him down and finish him!

1836
02:04:54,737 --> 02:04:57,115
Tommy, what are you doing?

1837
02:04:57,865 --> 02:04:59,492
Shut up. Come on.

1838
02:05:00,451 --> 02:05:01,919
Stand back.

1839
02:05:02,662 --> 02:05:05,791
Come on. What? Have you gone crazy?

1840
02:05:07,292 --> 02:05:08,965
Let's go to war!

1841
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:12,680
Brendan, pick your hands up!

1842
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:14,633
It's over.

1843
02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:18,516
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1844
02:05:20,013 --> 02:05:21,686
It's over, Tommy.

1845
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:22,932
You better fight!

1846
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:35,954
It's over, Tommy. Come on.

1847
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:42,452
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

1848
02:05:54,255 --> 02:05:56,849
Come on.
Why do you want to do this, Tommy?

1849
02:05:57,175 --> 02:05:58,518
Am I gonna have to watch you do this?

1850
02:06:06,184 --> 02:06:08,437
Okay? You all right there?

1851
02:06:09,228 --> 02:06:10,571
Tommy!

1852
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:23,493
Quick, finish him! You finish him!

1853
02:06:30,166 --> 02:06:31,543
Come on.

1854
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:45,273
