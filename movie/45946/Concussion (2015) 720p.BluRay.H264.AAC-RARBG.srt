1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,721
Ready.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,606
Set, hut!

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,260
Nice job, nice job.
Tempo, tempo. Let's go.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,980
- On the ball, on the ball. Let's go.
- On the ball, let's go.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,060
Reset.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,980
Tempo, tempo.
Let's pick it up this time, boys.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,140
What personnel they got, Coach?
All right, let's change it.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,900
Wall right, wall right.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,322
Make sure you pick off the flyer.
Here we go, here we go. Everybody up!

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,325
Ready. Set!

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,605
Set, hut!

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,940
There you go, get it, get it.
Turn up, turn up, turn up!

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,202
- Think fast! There you go.
- Just like this.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,290
There you go. Nice job. Nice job.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,620
Mike did. Someone to help me
with maximum protection. Mike did.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,540
Someone to help me call the play.
Mike did.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,460
Someone to help me get the team in line.
Mike did it.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,642
Mike controlled it, Mike ran it.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,122
We needed him, we used him,
we leaned on him.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,768
He was our strength in our offense.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,766
I know this man.
I know his backside as well as anybody.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,207
Simply, nothing has ever compared
to Mike Webster.

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,660
Ladies and gentlemen, the greatest center in
the history of the National Football League,

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,005
your inductee into the Hall of Fame,
number 52, "Iron Mike" Webster!

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,364
I'd like to begin...

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,321
Obviously, I want it to be fun,
but I want to be truthful.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,281
'Cause the people out there
are tremendous fans, locally

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,980
But as we go through this,
I want you to understand

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,644
the greatest thing that has happened to me
in my experience of professional football

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,249
is to have the opportunity
to work with people with a common goal

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,723
and with the same purpose,
and to sacrifice.

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,210
I'll say this,

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,084
it's painful playing football, obviously.

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,820
And it's not a lot of fun out there

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,084
to be in two-a-day drills
in the heat of the summer,

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,004
and banging heads.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,605
It's not a natural thing.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,081
I was scared I'd fail.
Honest to God, I was scared I'd fail.

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,284
I'm still scared of that.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,449
And all we have to do is finish the game.

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,211
If we finish, we win.

42
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,281
Yeah.

43
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,180
The state has asked,
after a lengthy trial,

44
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,569
a death sentence and two appeals,
why we would learn anything new from you.

45
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,570
Dr. Omalu, do you have a medical degree?

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,611
Yes. From the University of Nigeria.

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,521
At Enugu, Nigeria.

48
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,300
And I did my residency

49
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,883
at Columbia University Medical School
in New York.

50
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,281
I also have master's degrees
in Public Health and Epidemiology.

51
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,885
In addition,
I am a certified physician executive

52
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,651
with a specialty in Emergency Medicine.

53
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,380
And, of course, I'm board-certified

54
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,247
in Forensic Pathology, Clinical Pathology
and Anatomic Pathology.

55
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,931
My focus is Neuropathology,
the examination of the brain.

56
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,980
- While working as a Medical...
- I'm sorry. So sorry. I'm sorry.

57
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,449
I'm also completing my MBA
at Carnegie Mellon University.

58
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,140
And before I came to America,

59
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,371
a master's degree in the Theory of Music
from the Royal School of Music in London.

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,771
But... Your original question,
what can I add?

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,525
My specialty is the science of death.

62
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,360
I think more about why people die
than I do the way people live.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,082
Hands of the deceased.

64
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,020
Broken and dislodged fingernails.

65
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,604
The hands of a woman
who fought wildly for her life and lost.

66
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,961
The hands of the defendant,
Thomas Chambers.

67
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,740
And that is, in fact,
the blood of the victim.

68
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,540
Now, doesn't that suggest
that the state has the right man?

69
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,820
I thought so, until I heard hour 217
of Mr. Chambers' police interview.

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,481
I heard him very clearly say,
"I hate blood.

71
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,380
"I had a tooth pulled as a child once
and it would not stop bleeding."

72
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,323
- So, I got curious.
- What about?

73
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,804
Hands. I could not reconcile
these conflicting sets of hands.

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,780
So, my mind... My mind is going mad,
and I'm trying to figure out

75
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,521
if Thomas Chambers' family
has a history of hemophilia.

76
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,740
So, I asked his father
and his father said no.

77
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,660
But there is a strain of hemophilia,
hemophilia A,

78
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,580
so rare that it is never tested for.

79
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,700
Mr. Chambers tested positive
for hemophilia A.

80
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,364
His hands may have touched the victim,
perhaps to aid her, as he claims.

81
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,700
If his hands had been the murder weapon,
if he had been scratched or bitten,

82
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,802
he would have bled to death.

83
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,660
If the state of Pennsylvania
moves forward to execute,

84
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,321
you will be killing an innocent man.

85
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,648
Happy birthday to...

86
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,761
Way to go, Joe.

87
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,820
- Good morning, Gracie.
- Good morning, Dr. Omalu.

88
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,540
- Here are the cases for today.
- Okay. This is from yesterday.

89
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,926
Hey, we got a full room today.

90
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,371
- Cycle 'em through.
- Yes.

91
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,448
Let's begin with Rachel Green.

92
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,164
Okay, Rachel, I need your help.

93
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,322
We are in this together.

94
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,460
Please help me find out
what happened to you.

95
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,607
Here we go.

96
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,491
Danny, come on.

97
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,761
Gracie.

98
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,123
Dr. Omalu uses different stuff.
Makes less of a mess.

99
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,001
Possible causal relationship between
self-medication and early head trauma,

100
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,700
leading to narcotics abuse and overdose.

101
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,609
You're not her shrink, Bennet!

102
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,204
If I know how she lived,
I know why she died.

103
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,460
And you should be careful, Danny.

104
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,881
One day,
I may be rushing through your autopsy.

105
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,205
Dr. Wecht, Dr. Omalu is here to see you.

106
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,060
You know the reason
you're not back in Nigeria, don't you?

107
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,322
Yes. Because I remind you of you.

108
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,380
Only less handsome.

109
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,606
Sit.

110
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,060
What the hell is going on down there?

111
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,420
Nothing. I'm doing my work. I'm fine.

112
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,500
You're not fine.

113
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,161
Danny hates your guts.
I've never seen anything like it.

114
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,843
I think you're working a little too slow.

115
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,300
I'm a doctor.

116
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,740
The dead are my patients.
I treat them with respect.

117
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,540
But do you have to talk to them?

118
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,961
If you have to do that,
talk to them in your head.

119
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,100
And we discussed the knives.
You're still throwing them away.

120
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,340
We're a public agency in Pittsburgh.

121
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,204
They're expensive. Reuse them.

122
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,443
Would you want me to cut open your mother
with the same knife I used on a serial killer?

123
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,287
Yes.

124
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,130
I'd probably request it.

125
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,926
Cyril.

126
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,488
You need a girlfriend.

127
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,286
You need to touch somebody alive
every once in a while.

128
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,340
Living women are...
Well, occasionally they're a pain in the ass,

129
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,965
but quite often, they're amazing.

130
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,565
Give it a try.

131
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,807
Okay.

132
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,260
Just be a little less of an artist.

133
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,045
- Fit in a little more.
- Yes.

134
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,885
It's another death row case.

135
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,128
The guy's being railroaded.

136
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,528
$1,000 for you.

137
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,121
Cyril.

138
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,007
Webby.

139
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,451
Hey, man.

140
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,769
I am loving the digs.

141
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,121
Mike.

142
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,200
It's Justin.

143
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,806
- I'll just sit with you for a minute.
- Yeah.

144
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,606
Jugger.

145
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,620
We're all worried about you, man.

146
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,780
What are you doing, Mike? Mike! Mike!

147
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,300
- What are y'all doing? Give me that.
- No, no, no!

148
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,084
It's all right. It's just...

149
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,120
I just...

150
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,723
I don't want to go to sleep.

151
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,922
I heard you sold
your Super Bowl rings, Mike.

152
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,570
Your Super Bowl rings, Mike.

153
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,131
Mike, hey.

154
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,685
Pam's your wife.

155
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,929
- Garrett's your boy.
- Yeah, yeah.

156
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,402
I'm starting to forget things.

157
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,731
I'm saying this crazy crap to my kids.

158
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,926
I nearly pushed Keana into a wall.

159
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,580
- I never thought I'd do that to her.
- All right, well, don't...

160
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,569
Just don't give up.

161
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,727
All we got to do is finish the game.

162
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,965
We'll all be winners.

163
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,968
To the upright I will show

164
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,322
The saving power of God

165
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,484
To the upright

166
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,420
I will show

167
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,004
The saving power of God

168
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,324
How great

169
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,562
How great

170
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,330
Thou art

171
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,241
How great

172
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,482
How great

173
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,283
Thou art

174
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,527
- Have a good day. It's good to see you.
- Bennet! A moment?

175
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,051
Yes, Father.

176
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,900
- How are you?
- We have a new member.

177
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,900
A young lady from Kenya.

178
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,049
She came to us a couple weeks ago
and she needs our help.

179
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,740
Sure. How much do you need, Father?

180
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,844
She needs shelter, Bennet.
Until we find her something permanent.

181
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,300
Father, I'm working on my MBA. I'm studying.
My books are all over, everywhere.

182
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,940
She's a nice girl. She's from Nairobi.

183
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,420
Went to British school.

184
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,940
She wants to work.

185
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,566
We're letting her tidy up
around the church.

186
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,651
We're asking you because we know
she'll be safe and cared for.

187
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,000
- I feel God in you, Bennet.
- Thank you, Father.

188
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,685
Who is she?

189
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,926
So...

190
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,925
You can see.

191
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,568
That is basically my office, there.

192
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,163
Is that your father?

193
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,287
Yes. The chief.

194
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,804
Those are my peaches.

195
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,763
They should not be here.

196
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,965
Your room.

197
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,651
Your room. There is a...

198
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,521
The key, I have it for you.

199
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,050
How are you for money?

200
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,446
I have some.

201
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,446
No...

202
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,520
Need is not weak.

203
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,806
Need is need.

204
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,329
I know where you are.

205
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,011
I was you.

206
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,642
You're in America now.

207
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,006
So, you have to be
the best version of yourself.

208
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,524
If you don't know what that is,
you pick something and fake it.

209
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,210
So, I will just...

210
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,565
There, for you.

211
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,086
What did you pick?

212
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,660
- What did I pick?
- To fake.

213
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,482
I picked an older bald-headed white man.

214
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,129
Why an older bald-headed white man?

215
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,044
Because he is the best at what he does.

216
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,642
Do you want to see your room?

217
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,688
I was a registered nurse
at the Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi.

218
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,845
I understand.

219
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,289
I meant no offense.

220
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,247
Hey!

221
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,971
Hey, wake up!

222
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,249
Hey! Wake up, you.

223
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,460
Come on, now. This ain't no hotel.
You can't sleep here.

224
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,562
Put down your window, let's go!

225
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,740
You're Mike Webster, right?

226
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,285
Iron Mike.

227
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,100
I called for him. He's coming.

228
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,850
Okay, but I don't see him.

229
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,729
Come on, come on.

230
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,442
What? What is...

231
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,361
Look at that.

232
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,164
Mike, he's here.

233
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,926
Hey, Mike.

234
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,820
- Look, can you...
- Mike, can you hear me?

235
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,365
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just...

236
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,842
You just have to tell me what to do,
because I am...

237
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,644
I am freaking overwhelmed.

238
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,969
We're gonna get you some help, Mike.
What are you taking right now?

239
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,860
The Ritalin.

240
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,327
Dexedrine, Prozac, Klonopin,
you're still taking all of those?

241
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

242
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,300
- Come sit down.
- All of it, okay? And superglue.

243
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,020
- Okay.
- Yeah, superglue.

244
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,540
3.5 Haldol. You call his wife.
You tell her he's worse.

245
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,700
He's a lot worse.

246
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,500
You were my doctor.
You were my doctor, right?

247
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,500
- I was the team doctor.
- Okay! Okay, all right, then, the team doctor!

248
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,420
All right? The team doctor!

249
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,420
All right?
Then why aren't you helping me, all right?

250
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,460
- I am gonna help you.
- You are not helping me.

251
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,245
You got to fix this! You got to fix this!
All right?

252
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,930
In here, all right?

253
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,600
And in here. I am dying in here!

254
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,330
- I'm dying in here, all right?
- Dr. Bailes.

255
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,845
I hear you, Mike.

256
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,411
It's okay.

257
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,460
Let me give you
something to help you rest, Mike.

258
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,324
You want to rest, don't you?

259
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,580
I just want you to help me, all right?
I just want you to help me.

260
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,411
- I will help you, Mike.
- Just help me. Just...

261
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,444
- Come and sit down.
- Okay.

262
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,724
Come and sit down.

263
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,722
Well, go ahead, give me the drugs,
give me the drugs.

264
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,020
Show me how you're gonna help me.

265
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,690
Don't move, Mike.

266
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,648
Come and sit down, Mike.

267
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,724
Come lay down, Mike.

268
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,643
You rest now, Mike.

269
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,410
What am I missing?

270
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,724
- Tumor?
- No.

271
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,562
All of his scans were clean.

272
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,580
Through the years, the dauntless Webster

273
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,844
had abandoned his family, slipped into
financial chaos and homelessness.

274
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,620
This is a hard day for the city
of Pittsburgh. On a personal note,

275
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,460
I can remember sitting down with my father

276
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,580
and him giving me
examples of hard work ethic

277
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,340
and telling me when you get knocked down,
you get back up again.

278
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,603
I'm sorry, I don't usually watch TV.

279
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,403
Then why do you have one?

280
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,245
One has a TV in this country.

281
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,644
I'm sorry, I don't usually eat breakfast.

282
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,691
One should eat breakfast in this country.

283
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,806
Dear God,

284
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,460
thank You for the gifts You have
so graciously bestowed upon us.

285
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,326
Please help us to continue to be deservant
of Your blessings.

286
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,647
Amen.

287
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,487
Bennet!

288
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,060
Just hours after
he was rushed to the nearby hospital,

289
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,500
football Hall of Famer,
Iron Mike Webster...

290
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,140
- What is going on?
- Mike Webster.

291
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,260
Who's Mike Webster?

292
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,100
He's the greatest center
to ever play the game.

293
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,247
He's a true warrior.

294
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,060
- I'm sorry. What is a center?
- The big guy in the middle. Hikes it.

295
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,980
My kid plays football because of this guy.

296
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,260
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just did not know who he was.

297
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,380
Well, if you're gonna live in this town,

298
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,580
you gonna work in this town,
football is a good thing.

299
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,420
I freaking can't believe it's you.

300
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,380
Well, as you know, I was put
on the schedule for this weekend.

301
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,580
I am put on the schedule
for every weekend.

302
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,365
Come on. Come on.

303
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,608
The whole town was out of work.

304
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,180
He was a guy who gave us hope
when there really was no hope.

305
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,204
Just leave him be.

306
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,289
Look at his teeth.

307
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,166
He was pulling them out
and supergluing them back in.

308
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,420
Gracie, full autopsy, please.

309
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,251
Hey, come on, man.
There's no need to cut this man's body.

310
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,660
Why does an apparently healthy
favorite son of this city

311
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,048
become self-mutilating and homeless at 50?

312
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,729
Cardiac arrest may be how he died,
but not why.

313
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,407
- Prepare the body, please.
- Yes.

314
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,043
I think what he's saying is that
sometimes in life, you know, you just...

315
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,522
You're asked to leave it alone.

316
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,963
But sometimes you can't.

317
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,540
Do you believe that he thinks
this is a time that I should leave it alone?

318
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,404
No, I don't.

319
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,300
I never leave it alone.

320
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,368
That's why people hate me.

321
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,401
Mike.

322
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,805
People are saying bad things about you.

323
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,401
I can tell something is wrong.

324
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,129
But I can't do this alone.

325
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,280
I need your help
to tell the world what happened to you.

326
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,081
Sorry.

327
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,768
Regular folds of gray matter.

328
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,929
No obvious contusions.

329
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,362
No shrinkage from Alzheimer's.

330
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,880
What's wrong?

331
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,084
Can you show me the CT scan again, please?

332
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,161
- How old are these?
- Six months.

333
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,285
Six months.

334
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,962
This brain should be a mess.

335
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,083
But it looks completely normal.

336
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,326
Records say severe headaches,
double vision, voices in his head.

337
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,329
No documented concussions.

338
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,443
He did complain of dizziness.

339
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,088
- How often?
- Once.

340
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,091
In 18 years of professional football?

341
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,900
"Joseph Maroon."

342
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,889
Sign the certificate. Sew him up.

343
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,003
Fix the brain, please.

344
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,004
You know we don't have
the budget to do that.

345
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,500
People do not go mad for no reason.
I'm going to continue looking.

346
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,489
No, you're not going to.

347
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,660
Danny, you are out of line.

348
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,060
Hey, you do not speak to me like that!

349
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,700
I am the pathologist on duty!

350
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,940
- I am the pathologist of record!
- Hey! Listen!

351
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,660
This is not your laboratory!

352
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,420
My hands are on this body!
If I am wrong, I am wrong!

353
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,887
- And you are wrong.
- Not you, me!

354
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,566
Fix that brain.

355
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,900
Hey, I am gonna make sure
they don't pay for any of this.

356
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,180
I am going to write my orders
for the tests that I need.

357
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,521
- And you're paying for it yourself.
- Yes, Danny.

358
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,683
Please, exit my workplace.

359
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,806
Please!

360
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,620
In 25 years, I've never requested
a panel of tests like this.

361
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,926
What are you looking for?

362
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,162
There is not a single case
in a book or in life

363
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,060
where a man that healthy
went that mad that young

364
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,766
with no visible abnormality of the brain.

365
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,780
I don't know what I'm looking for.

366
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,291
I can tell.

367
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,848
It's going to cost you a fortune.

368
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,531
I understand.

369
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,406
Okay.

370
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,844
Well, if you have to play hero,
just make sure we both come out okay.

371
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,920
Dr. Omalu. You got something today.
Left it on your desk.

372
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,441
Thank you.

373
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,801
Prema!

374
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,166
It's very late. Where have you been?

375
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,290
I got a job.

376
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,851
- Look at you.
- Well, a shift.

377
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,210
At a home. Feeding old people.

378
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,488
That is fantastic. Congratulations.

379
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,011
What is that?

380
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,650
Mike Webster.

381
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,847
...phrase is worth $1,000. And here we go.

382
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,168
Would you like me
to get you a TV for your room?

383
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,366
No. This one will be fine.

384
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,201
Okay.

385
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,402
I can't tell what you're more afraid of.

386
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,243
What you will find, or what you won't.

387
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,160
My God.

388
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,286
My God.

389
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,540
...jacked up from those guys that are
gonna be racing those sides on this.

390
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,540
Let's get to Jacked Up Number 5.

391
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,140
We're gonna begin
with the Rams and the Chargers.

392
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,380
Mark Bulger gonna be delivering the ball
to Tony Fisher.

393
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,220
Throws it down around his feet.

394
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,164
So, Donnie Edwards is gonna
level him right there.

395
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,980
Always be looking out
for the big hit right there.

396
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,526
- Tony Fisher got jacked up!
- Jacked up!

397
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,171
Number 4, the Seahawks and the Chiefs.

398
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,002
D.J. Hackett is gonna make the catch
and Ty Law will launch him backwards.

399
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,730
How far backwards?

400
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,171
Eyes on me! Eyes on me! Gentlemen!

401
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,243
This is a game of awareness.

402
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,327
It is a game of desire.
That's why we have the three-whistle drill.

403
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,971
Let's go!

404
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,285
When I blow this whistle three times,
you seek out a teammate. Any teammate.

405
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,328
You make collision,
you be physical, you be violent!

406
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,211
Bring it in here, let's go! Bring it in!

407
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,767
The only way you're gonna get
this player's hands off you,

408
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,100
you grab him by the throat
and you squeeze!

409
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,250
You choke him until shit runs down his leg!
Do you understand me?

410
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,570
Let's go! Do it!

411
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,844
Drive! Drive! Hit him!

412
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,162
Hit it! Drive! Drive!

413
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,820
The Jaguars and the Eagles. Dirk Johnson.

414
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,660
And I'm gonna wait for this because
the look on his face

415
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,240
- tells you that he got jacked up!
- Jacked up!

416
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,686
And our Number 1 hit of the week,

417
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,843
Jon Kitna dropping back the pass,

418
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,004
and Shawntae Spencer
lifts him off his feet!

419
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,649
- Oh, my God! And Jon Kitna got jacked up!
- Jacked up!

420
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,161
You should see this, Bennet.

421
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,960
It's actually really beautiful.

422
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,324
Priest Holmes, he's diving.
Yes, he's got it! Touchdown!

423
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,041
Tremendous! Tremendous catch!

424
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,367
I want to show you something.

425
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,885
A human brain

426
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,802
sits in a fluid completely disconnected
from the human skull.

427
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,728
Bennet, will you relax?
I can hear you breathing.

428
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,041
This is a really terrible brain.

429
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,207
Ever met the great DeKosky before?

430
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,362
Expect two minutes, tops.

431
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,725
Is that him?

432
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,571
So, you're our prize graduate.

433
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,321
Tell him.

434
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,051
It's Mike Webster.

435
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,860
- The Pittsburgh...
- I know who Mike Webster is.

436
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,121
Steve.

437
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,891
He was 50.

438
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,169
You have my attention.

439
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,740
The Cape gannet.

440
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,660
A diving bird capable of generating speeds
of up to 75 miles per hour,

441
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,685
turning itself into a missile
as it collides with the face of the sea.

442
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,820
The red-head woodpecker
can absorb a G-force of 1,000,

443
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,962
pecking a tree 12,000 times per day,
85 million times over its lifetime.

444
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,380
Bighorn sheep can generate...

445
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,720
Bennet.

446
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,971
Okay, okay.

447
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,490
All of these animals have shock absorbers
built into their bodies.

448
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,420
The woodpecker's tongue extends through
the back of the mouth out of the nostril,

449
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,204
encircling the entire cranium.

450
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,328
It is the anatomical equivalent
of a safety belt for its brain.

451
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,410
Human beings?

452
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,607
Not a single piece of our anatomy
protects us from those types of collisions.

453
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,001
A human being will get
concussed at 60 G's.

454
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,962
A common head-to-head contact
on a football field?

455
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,287
One hundred G's.

456
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,363
God did not intend for us
to play football.

457
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,247
Let's keep God out of this.

458
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,681
Okay.

459
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,521
Okay. Look.

460
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,045
- What are the S's?
- The Steelers.

461
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,127
- And the O's?
- The others, obviously.

462
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,520
Yes, the other team.

463
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,523
Do you even watch football?

464
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,060
No, not at all.

465
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,242
But I've been studying
Mike Webster's position.

466
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,620
The man in the middle is quite deceptively
the most violent position on the field.

467
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,820
The slaps, the punches, the forearm.

468
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,163
It is an unremitting storm
of sub-concussive blows.

469
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,340
The head as a weapon
on every single play of every single game

470
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,048
of every single practice, from the time
he was a little boy to a college man,

471
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,483
culminating in
an 18-year professional career.

472
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,260
By my calculations,

473
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,003
Mike Webster sustained
more than 70,000 blows to his head.

474
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,367
Now, now, these men, these men,

475
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,883
these are the fastest.

476
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,660
Now, their speed multiplied by
the speed of the men who hit them,

477
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,300
the G-forces generated

478
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,121
equivalent to hitting them on the helmet
with a sledgehammer.

479
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,406
All of this

480
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,163
triggered a cascading series
of neurological events

481
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,763
which unleashed killer proteins
upon Mike Webster's brain,

482
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,449
the tangles invading and strangling
his mind from the inside out.

483
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,965
Like pouring wet concrete
down kitchen pipes

484
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,440
as it hardens, it chokes the brain,
leaving him unrecognizable,

485
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,930
even to himself.

486
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,244
I don't know football. I've never played.

487
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,684
But I am telling you
that playing football killed Mike Webster.

488
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,447
And I am certain that there are others.

489
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,041
And how can you possibly know that?

490
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,965
Common sense.

491
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,580
But they are either dead or lost
in the way that Mike Webster was lost.

492
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,060
I'm not interested in common sense.

493
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,242
I'm interested in science.

494
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,044
And science is knowing.

495
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,980
I know from these players' records

496
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,380
that their doctors believe
they have early Alzheimer's,

497
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,926
which is statistically impossible.

498
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,124
They're too young.

499
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,480
Because it's not Alzheimer's.

500
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,526
It is this.

501
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,044
I don't like it.

502
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,087
No.

503
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,363
No, actually, I hate it.

504
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,363
But as a scientist,

505
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,450
I can't deny it.

506
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,610
Name it. You have to give this a name.

507
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,847
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

508
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,527
Did they agree what it is?

509
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,846
Yes. We are going to publish.

510
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,281
They...

511
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,524
- With you?
- Yes.

512
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,970
In a medical journal.

513
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,241
With you?

514
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,600
Yes, with me. Together.

515
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,804
That's so...

516
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,045
Congratulations.

517
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,769
Thank you. Thank you.

518
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,921
You...

519
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,848
Are you going somewhere?

520
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,766
Yes.

521
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,846
With you.

522
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,286
To celebrate.

523
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,922
You don't dance, do you?

524
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,726
I had quite a revelation tonight.

525
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,927
This body was made for dancing.

526
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,729
When they say "dancing machine,"
I am what they mean.

527
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,525
I'm very proud of you.

528
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,921
Okay.

529
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,529
May I kiss you?

530
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,369
- Good morning.
- Cyril.

531
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,724
It's very weird to bring women
into the morgue at night.

532
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,850
- She is a friend.
- You don't have friends.

533
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,500
Listen, Danny knows she's been in there.

534
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,284
He's thinking about filing
a formal complaint.

535
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,447
What?

536
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,020
I was working on Webster.

537
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,929
I know. I'll take care of it.

538
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,361
How much has that cost you so far?

539
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,282
- $20,000.
- Twenty?

540
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,245
I save.

541
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,525
- Everything.
- Really? How un-American.

542
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,300
Well, maybe it was worth it.

543
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,925
I got the call.

544
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,362
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

545
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,220
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

546
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,606
Yes. CTE.

547
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,890
So, what happens now?

548
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,010
We publish. DeKosky is going to coauthor.

549
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,260
- DeKosky?
- Yes.

550
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,570
Omalu, DeKosky and Cyril Wecht.

551
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,805
Well, I'm very proud of you.

552
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,121
Thank you.

553
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,289
See? The gray's the right color.
The blue shows the dirt, even in the rain.

554
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,245
Here you go.

555
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,404
Let's go, baby!

556
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,365
Come on, get it, get it, get it!

557
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,180
And watch the play-action.
The safeties jump up.

558
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,460
And look at that touch
by Ben Roethlisberger.

559
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,820
And Plaxico Burress does a great job.
Looked like he tripped...

560
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,001
You make no sense!

561
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,568
I say not to, but he does.

562
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,643
Roethlisberger scrambling out
of the pocket.

563
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,602
Throwing across the middle! Caught!

564
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,605
Burress at the 45!

565
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,920
And if you don't know, Plaxico!

566
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,126
Yeah. That was a pressure toss
by the rook.

567
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,500
- I'm hearing voices.
- Are you serious?

568
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,900
- They're just talking.
- Stop. Justin, stop. You're scaring me.

569
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,340
You're scaring them.

570
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,521
Look at me!

571
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,380
They're telling me to kill you.

572
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,847
They're telling me to kill you!

573
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,124
Get out! Get out!

574
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,286
Get out!

575
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,961
No!

576
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,086
All units, black pickup spotted on thruway
eight miles...

577
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,482
Okay, I see him. Just passing me.
Where am I?

578
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,660
Reportedly driving into opposite traffic
last 10 miles.

579
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,091
Oh, my God.

580
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,651
Pickup has collided.

581
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,650
All units. Reported collision.

582
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,260
A few months after Steeler favorite
Justin Strzelczyk

583
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,260
was killed in that fiery accident,

584
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,260
yet another Steeler favorite, Terry Long,

585
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,620
has apparently committed suicide
at the age of 45.

586
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,881
Terry.

587
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,768
You wonder where they are now?
Now we know.

588
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,123
Terry Long, Pittsburgh Steelers.

589
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,522
I guess these guys only die
when you're working.

590
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,008
- What other problems did he have?
- Arrested a few times.

591
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,481
Fraud, federal theft.

592
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,441
Arrested a lot.

593
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,130
I need a full autopsy.

594
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,100
- Same tests as Mike Webster.
- You're paying for that, too?

595
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,680
Yes, Danny, I'm paying for that, too.

596
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,044
Joseph Maroon.

597
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,724
This is my dream.

598
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,203
The schools are good.

599
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,089
You are good, Prema.

600
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,962
I'm sure you see good in me.

601
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,723
I see all that you are.

602
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,643
I want to marry you.

603
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,569
We can fall in love.

604
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,401
If you want to marry me,

605
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,368
I will marry you.

606
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,482
That is good,
because I already made the down payment.

607
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,245
I saved all my money
and I bought this for you.

608
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,043
Get me Elliot Pellman.

609
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,088
I have Chris Jones for you.

610
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,801
I'm just looking at it.

611
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,403
Anything to be concerned about?

612
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,723
This Omalu, he's a coroner in Pittsburgh.

613
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,526
He looks like a nobody,
but let me get into it.

614
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,966
All right.

615
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,891
- Hello?
- Is Bennet Omalu there?

616
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,284
Yes, he is.

617
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,500
Yes.

618
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,921
I'm a neurologist
who's worked around football for years.

619
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,980
Very familiar
with the NFL's concussion research.

620
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,500
And the League concluded unequivocally

621
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,843
that football players
do not get brain damage.

622
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,651
Webster is one random case, Mr. Omalu.

623
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,380
Dr. Omalu.

624
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,326
Well, whatever. You're an uneducated quack
and your career is over.

625
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,208
They said you were uneducated?

626
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,860
Did they even read your résumé?

627
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,780
Well, I got calls, too.

628
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,420
Apparently, the National Football League
owns neuroscience.

629
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,521
Who knew?

630
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,325
"Failure to find."

631
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,000
"Absence of clinical information."

632
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,580
- What do they want?
- Your head on a spike.

633
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,860
They want you to retract your findings.

634
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,361
They want you to say you made it all up.

635
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,965
- I made it up?
- They're accusing you of fraud.

636
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,482
If you retract, you'll be fine.
This all goes away.

637
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,740
Why... Why are they doing this?

638
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,251
They're terrified of you.

639
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,820
What did you think they were gonna say?
"Thank you"?

640
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,900
Yes.

641
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,685
- What the hell for?
- For being told.

642
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,320
For knowing.

643
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,445
I understand.

644
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,928
You think you're being a good American.

645
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,884
So, the city of Pittsburgh
spent $233 million

646
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:19,251
to build their glorious Steelers
a new stadium.

647
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,849
All the while, they were closing
schools and raising taxes.

648
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,763
These people
are not out to change the world.

649
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,580
And this is not some
quaint academic discovery

650
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,843
stuck in the back of
an obscure medical journal.

651
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,860
Bennet Omalu is going to war
with a corporation

652
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,900
that has 20 million people, on a weekly
basis, craving their product,

653
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,401
the same way they crave food.

654
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,490
The NFL owns a day of the week.

655
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,046
The same day the church used to own.

656
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,764
Now it's theirs.

657
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,850
They're very big.

658
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,771
Terry Long.

659
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,407
The tests came back positive.

660
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,287
Football gave him CTE,
and CTE told his brain

661
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,244
to drink a gallon of antifreeze,
and he died.

662
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,284
I told you there would be more.

663
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,922
You have done great work.

664
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,521
No one would blame you if you stopped now.

665
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,282
No one is stopping anything.

666
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,284
Then I'd be lying if I didn't tell you
how important your next move is.

667
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,980
By the time Terry Long committed suicide,

668
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,802
his brain had been consumed
by chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

669
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,328
And it is probable, perhaps even likely,

670
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,540
that a larger percentage of professional
football players have and will die from CTE.

671
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,700
This was the Pittsburgh Medical Examiner's
own Dr. Bennet Omalu, who today

672
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,644
threw down the gauntlet
at the feet of the National Football League.

673
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,366
Thank you.

674
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,100
What do you think?

675
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,202
I think you're gonna be an American hero.

676
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,240
- I'm not even an American.
- That's even better.

677
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,284
That's so fucking American.

678
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,940
"Dr. Maroon, who is also vice-chairman of

679
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,540
"the neurosurgery department at
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,

680
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,682
"said of Omalu's CTE diagnosis
that it was fallacious reasoning."

681
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,540
Yes.

682
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,340
Yeah, is this Bennet Omalu?

683
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,220
Dr. Bennet Omalu.

684
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,740
You want to pussify this country?
You want to vaginize football?

685
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,208
Get the hell out.
Or they'll be doing your autopsy.

686
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,251
Dr. Omalu?

687
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,681
Yes.

688
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,780
I took you to be an early riser.
I didn't want to call you at your office.

689
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,087
This is Julian Bailes.

690
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,820
Do you know who I am?

691
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,763
I know who you are.

692
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,889
Mike Webster was a personal friend.

693
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,860
Was he?

694
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,200
Dr. Omalu.

695
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,689
You're in trouble, but you're not wrong.

696
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,123
I'd like to talk with you.

697
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,643
The NFL has known about
this concussion crisis for years.

698
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,580
And what you have there is the research

699
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,650
that forms the basis
for the League's concussion guidelines.

700
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,980
In this study,

701
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,900
some academics put helmets on monkeys
and shook them real hard.

702
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,324
They threw dogs and pigs
and human cadavers down elevator shafts.

703
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,700
Helmets on crash-test dummies
and bashed them together.

704
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,245
And their conclusion?

705
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,406
"No striking player
experienced neck injury or concussion."

706
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,122
So, a concussion's no more dangerous
than a hangnail.

707
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,683
- And that was it?
- No, no, no.

708
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,700
The NFL did what every organization does.

709
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,260
They put together a commission
to study the study.

710
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,060
Dr. Elliot Pellman's
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee.

711
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,940
You know who else was on that committee?

712
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,180
- Dr. Maroon.
- Joe, yeah, he was on there.

713
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,124
Plus a couple of other team doctors,

714
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,364
an equipment manager and two trainers,
guys who tape knees for a living.

715
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,446
I mean...

716
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,723
Why am I here, Dr. Bailes?

717
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,844
Doctor, I'm not with the Steelers anymore.

718
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,402
I'm not with the NFL.

719
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,100
Now, do you know how many
Pittsburgh Steelers, just Steelers, now,

720
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,567
have died in the last few years?

721
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,964
And I'm not talking about the older guys.

722
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,482
I'm talking about men that I worked with,
and just the ones that I know about.

723
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,206
Twelve.

724
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,100
And I don't want to see

725
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,330
any more of these men
vanish in the back of a pickup truck.

726
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,765
I know them.

727
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,290
I was them.

728
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,524
And I think you're doing this wrong.

729
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,367
As long as the NFL continues
to deny the truth, nothing changes.

730
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,807
It's only true if they say it's true.

731
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,287
And they've got to say it out loud.

732
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,780
Get me a meeting with the Commissioner.

733
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,441
I want to sit with him, man to man,
face to face. I will make him say it out loud.

734
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,529
They don't want to talk to you.

735
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,971
Football does not want to talk to you.

736
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,460
Like my daddy, a Louisiana judge,
always used to say to me,

737
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:45,122
"Son, God is number one
and football is number two."

738
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,048
Besides, to them you're not even American.
You're not even African-American.

739
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,966
You're...

740
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,160
A doctor?

741
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,161
Okay.

742
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,046
Look.

743
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,085
The League has kept everyone in the dark.

744
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,285
And you turned on the lights
and gave their biggest boogeyman a name.

745
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,083
What's happening now, what you think
they're doing to you, that's nothing.

746
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,722
I've done my own research
on this NFL Brain Injury Committee.

747
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,160
You know what Dr. Elliot Pellman is?

748
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,091
He's a rheumatologist.

749
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,283
He's a specialist in arthritis
and joint pain.

750
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,367
Can you tell me what a rheumatologist knows
about the brain and brain disease?

751
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,367
Corporate men like this, in this country,
usually go to Harvard or Yale.

752
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,325
He went to medical school in Guadalajara.

753
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,365
- Mexico?
- Yes.

754
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,924
I did not know that.

755
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,931
That's beautiful.

756
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,280
Now, two cases does not meet
the scientific burden of proof.

757
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,445
You have to keep going.

758
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,722
Just so you understand,
this does not show up on a CT scan.

759
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,900
Which means
there's no diagnosis before death.

760
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,402
In order for me to keep going,
more have to die.

761
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,810
Unfortunately, that's already happening.

762
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,246
Double D.

763
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,260
Did I hear right? We're losing you?

764
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,488
Tapping you for mayor of Chicago?

765
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,483
Still a long, long road, my friend.

766
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:19,260
All-world killer athlete to civilian
to king, all in one lifetime.

767
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,980
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Mayor Dave Duerson,

768
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,367
who has figured it out.

769
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,161
- Dave!
- Yeah.

770
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,380
It's me, man. Andre Waters.

771
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,641
How you doing, man?

772
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,810
Look, let me walk with you.

773
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,260
This is not good, Dave, not good.
It's in the paperwork.

774
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,443
But why is the committee doing this, man?

775
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,060
There are five other trustees.
You talk to them?

776
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,340
You're the only one who played, man.

777
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,442
You the only one
who knows what it is to be us.

778
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,860
Hey, hey, hey.
You and me, we were the same, man.

779
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,380
We were bangers, hitmen.

780
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,084
File the appeal.

781
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,340
You denied the appeal, Dave!
Look, something's wrong with me, man.

782
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,566
I can't sleep. Okay...

783
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,860
I mean, my eyes get crossed.
It just weirds me out.

784
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,020
- Hey! Look at me!
- Jesus!

785
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,220
Look. Twelve years I paid my dues.

786
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,100
I made millions for those assholes.

787
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,540
Come on. It's not even your money, man.

788
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,041
I'm just asking back what I gave!

789
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,860
Listen. Fat? Stop eating like a pig.
Got a headache? See a doctor.

790
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:23,328
I've seen 20 doctors!
I just need rent money.

791
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,682
Get your shit together!

792
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,100
You used to be a warrior.

793
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,740
- You fucking sellout.
- Get your hands off me!

794
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,140
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

795
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,620
Look, hey, hey, hey.

796
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,564
Remember when we were kids?
Remember when we were kids?

797
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,128
Playing's what we lived for.

798
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,850
I need your help. I need your help, Dave.

799
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,365
Dave, help me!

800
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:05,527
"Andre Waters, known as 'Dirty Waters,'
notorious for his aggressive style of play

801
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,571
"and devastating hits
that filled highlight reels.

802
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,646
"Waters died of a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.

803
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,525
"He was 44."

804
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:26,288
And this is the part
where he got knocked out.

805
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,620
Andre Waters has it. We'll be back...

806
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,700
He said he was all right.

807
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,691
Said he was just a little dazed,
but he said he was all right.

808
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,690
You look well.

809
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,087
- How are the kids?
- Kids are fine.

810
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,800
I'm fine.

811
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,321
I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to the funeral.

812
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,282
No one made it to the funeral.

813
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,285
He was the sun.

814
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,809
We was the planets.

815
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:09,963
And then, after he gave me this card,
he said, "Ma,

816
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,604
"I'm ready to go."

817
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,649
Because he knew
people was thinking he was crazy.

818
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,525
Not crazy.

819
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,565
He'd already become someone else.

820
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,971
You definitely think he had this disease?

821
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,481
Because I want to believe that.

822
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,850
I believe so, yes.

823
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,365
And now you want what's left of my boy.

824
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,530
You heard about Mike Webster?

825
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,962
And Terry Long and...

826
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,806
And...

827
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,410
And who else?

828
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,644
What do you really want to ask me, Julian?

829
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,804
Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Julian Bailes.

830
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,930
Pleasure to meet you.

831
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,365
Andre Waters.

832
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,010
Justin Strzelczyk.

833
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,128
I just kept sending them back out there.

834
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,043
What the hell were you thinking?

835
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,485
You've got to be a part of it.

836
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,730
You've got to be on the sidelines
with them to understand.

837
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,540
Whatever it takes to keep them in the game,
to keep the whole thing going.

838
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,060
Tape, needles, Vicodin,
Toradol, Lidocaine,

839
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,289
Percocet, Lexapro, Zoloft.

840
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,288
Have I left anything out?

841
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,449
It's tires and oil.

842
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,340
Just mechanics trying to keep
the cars on the racetrack.

843
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,967
Yeah, well, it's not medicine.
I don't know what it is.

844
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,410
It's business.

845
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,242
- There you go.
- Okay, okay.

846
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,620
Three cases
is the scientific burden of evidence.

847
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,960
We have four.

848
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,460
That is far beyond anything
the NFL can or cannot deny.

849
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,642
This is bigger than they are.

850
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,406
They have to listen to us now.

851
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,925
Dr. Maroon.

852
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,646
- Would you like a drink?
- I said five minutes.

853
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,820
He doesn't want a drink.

854
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,083
Your conclusions
totally misrepresent the facts.

855
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,980
To say that Webster and Long and Waters
were killed by football is...

856
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,526
Is fallacious reasoning.

857
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,485
Yes, I know.

858
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,003
Where's he going with this?

859
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,005
Just hear him out.

860
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,448
I would like to propose
a formal, controlled study

861
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,500
of former and current
NFL football players.

862
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,561
We will bring together the greatest minds
in America to solve the problem.

863
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,045
We should be working together.

864
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,044
Who do you think you're talking to?

865
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,001
Excuse me?

866
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,762
I was the President of
the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

867
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,089
And I was the man
who performed the autopsies

868
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,886
on Mike Webster, Terry Long.

869
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,211
Your men.

870
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,369
Men under your care.

871
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,620
Do you know what Mike Webster's wife said?

872
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:36,408
She said that if she had known
that Mike was sick,

873
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,641
she would have done more for him.

874
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,568
But he died in disgrace.

875
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,207
Your man.

876
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,685
Your man.

877
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,924
You took an oath.

878
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,660
- Tell the truth.
- The truth?

879
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,411
- Tell the truth!
- The truth is

880
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,970
that the NFL is a blessing
and a salvation, my friend.

881
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,660
We employ hundreds of thousands of people.

882
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,765
We send thousands and thousands
of poor kids to school.

883
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,340
The ownership of this football club

884
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,340
has donated millions of dollars
to countless charities.

885
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,284
- Do you want me to go on?
- That won't be necessary.

886
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,283
It is necessary.

887
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,844
Football is the most popular
sport in America

888
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,568
because it is so goddamn fantastic!

889
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,803
And that, right there?

890
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:43,762
That is the beating heart of this city.

891
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,700
And you want to, what, end it?

892
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,122
You want to fold up
the National Football League?

893
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,500
I want to solve the problem.

894
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,965
Who are you?

895
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,644
- What are you asking?
- You're a pathologist.

896
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,460
You perform autopsies.

897
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,050
Yes, I am a mere pathologist.

898
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,288
That's it. That's all I am.

899
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,721
Wow.

900
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,482
Do you have any idea
of the impact of what you're doing?

901
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,300
- Yes, I do.
- Do you understand the impact

902
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,100
of what you are doing?

903
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,620
If just 10% of the mothers in America

904
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,780
decide that football is too dangerous
for their sons to play,

905
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,168
that is it. It is the end of football.

906
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:35,441
Kids, colleges, and eventually, it's just
a matter of time, the professional game.

907
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,562
Joe, he does autopsies.
He's not in the outcome business.

908
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,689
He has no business.

909
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,247
Do you know what history does to people,

910
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,803
trained physicians,

911
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,122
- who ignore science?
- Wow.

912
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,248
Sir, I am not done!

913
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,084
History laughs.

914
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:01,130
If you continue to deny my work,
the world will deny my work.

915
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,607
But men, your men,

916
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,845
continue to die,
their families left in ruins.

917
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,245
Tell the truth.

918
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,885
Tell the truth.

919
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,443
You sure... You sure you want to do this?

920
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,409
I would ask you that same question,
Dr. Maroon.

921
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,883
Your study, I'll get back to you.

922
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,769
Well, that went well.

923
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,926
When I was a boy growing up in Nigeria,

924
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:55,641
heaven was here and America was here.

925
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,844
To me, it was the place
where God sent all of His favorite people.

926
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,204
You could be anything,
you could do anything.

927
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:14,888
Americans were the manifestation
of what God wanted us all to be.

928
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,963
I have never wanted anything

929
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:27,641
as much as I wanted to be accepted
as an American.

930
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:38,686
But Mike Webster goes mad
and nobody asks why.

931
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,003
They make fun of him.

932
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,260
They insult him on TV.

933
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,540
And now they want to pretend
that his disease does not exist.

934
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,041
And they want to bury me.

935
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,204
It's offensive.

936
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,448
I am offended.

937
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,889
I am the wrong person
to have discovered this.

938
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,202
There is no coincidence in this world.

939
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,166
Tell me,

940
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:27,206
what is the statistical probability
that you, not just a doctor,

941
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,648
but Bennet Omalu, came to America

942
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:39,969
ended up here in this rusty place
for you alone to be the one to see this?

943
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,801
When I arrived in New York,

944
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,050
I was attacked.

945
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,926
What happened?

946
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,931
Something that is better left unsaid.

947
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,561
But that man almost broke me.

948
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:09,326
I wanted to give up and go back.

949
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,202
But I knew God.

950
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:22,165
I decided to trust His wisdom
and I stayed.

951
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:28,606
And now I am looking at this man,

952
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:32,081
an Omalu Onyemalukwube.

953
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,767
Your name, it means, "If you know,

954
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,247
"you must come forth and speak."

955
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,329
How did you know that?

956
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,260
I called your father.

957
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,020
He was pleased to hear from me.

958
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,088
Yes, I am sure he was.

959
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,408
If you don't speak for the dead, who will?

960
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,171
You are of the Igbo tribe, Bennet.

961
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,563
When you have truth,

962
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,860
the thing you are told you cannot do
is the thing you must do.

963
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,610
Embrace that

964
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,966
and nothing created by man
can bring you down.

965
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,610
Omalu's gone to the press now.
Listen to this.

966
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,660
"After examining the remains

967
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,420
"of former National Football League player
Andre Waters,

968
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,820
"a neuropathologist in Pittsburgh,
Dr. Bennet Omalu, is claiming

969
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,209
"that Mr. Waters had sustained brain damage
from playing football, and he says

970
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,848
"that led to his depression
and ultimate death."

971
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,770
It gets worse.

972
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,460
"Dr. Julian Bailes, medical director

973
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,660
"for the Center for
the Study of Retired Athletes

974
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,685
"and the chairman of the Department of
Neurosurgery of West Virginia University,

975
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,406
"said, 'Unfortunately, I'm not shocked.'"

976
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,647
There's more Omalu and more Bailes.

977
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,180
Bailes. Why do I know that name?

978
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:04,126
Steelers team doctor.
Neurologist for the Players Association.

979
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,730
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

980
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,284
The Times is calling it
a potential epidemic.

981
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,847
Paul.

982
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,806
It's not the Sports section, not Science.

983
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,329
It's A-1, front page New York Times.

984
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,326
Apparently, the Commissioner

985
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,660
has been yearning for years
to go back to his litigator roots.

986
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:37,563
Paul Tagliabue announced that he would
retire in July after nearly 17 years.

987
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:42,921
...comprised the most lucrative
and stabilizing reign perhaps in the history.

988
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,720
At the NFL owners meeting in Illinois,
Roger Goodell...

989
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,020
There's a new sheriff in town.
His name is Roger Goodell.

990
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,660
Each day seems to bring
a fresh round of tributes.

991
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,380
What I'm here to do now
is protect the shield.

992
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,324
The NFL isn't just a sports league.

993
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,730
It's an entertainment product.

994
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,685
America's game.

995
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,180
I want us to go on enjoying
our great game...

996
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,281
Allegheny County Coroner.

997
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,604
Sure, one second.

998
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,842
- It's Dr. Julian Bailes.
- Yes, yeah.

999
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,685
Here he is.

1000
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:14,980
Julian.

1001
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,820
- Hey, turn on the TV.
- Yes, I'm watching.

1002
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,766
You asked for a face-to-face
with the Commissioner? Man to man?

1003
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:26,085
Goodell and the NFL
are asking for a concussion summit.

1004
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:30,047
A full presentation in Chicago next week.

1005
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,645
They heard you.

1006
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,849
You have your shot.

1007
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,646
Julian.

1008
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,540
Why don't you throw in
some football stuff?

1009
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,563
Some non-medical terms?

1010
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,131
Things we'd say.

1011
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,691
Why do I need to say things they'd say?

1012
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,247
I thought I was here for the other reason.

1013
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,521
No.

1014
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,060
You have what, seven, eight degrees?

1015
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,369
You're one of the smartest people
they'll ever meet.

1016
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,925
You know what?

1017
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,204
You're gonna be fine.

1018
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,290
How about you?

1019
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,725
How will you be?

1020
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:42,769
You know, it is a mindless, violent game
and then it's Shakespeare.

1021
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,780
I mean, to me it's like life that way.

1022
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:49,407
And I know you can't see how exciting

1023
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,401
and beautiful all that is,
and I don't blame you.

1024
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,086
But what I'm trying to tell you is
this is not fun for me.

1025
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,140
All of the people we're going to
see tomorrow, I know them personally.

1026
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,765
And that feeling you have

1027
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:11,363
when someone you love and admire
screws you over?

1028
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,040
They're going to have that feeling.

1029
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,805
Because of me.

1030
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,965
And there is not a damn thing
I can do about it.

1031
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,607
Hey.

1032
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,340
We have to talk.

1033
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,771
What's wrong?

1034
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,967
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'm just going to say it.

1035
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,849
They're not gonna let you speak.

1036
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,641
What?

1037
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,642
They don't even want you in the room.

1038
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,646
They want me to do it.

1039
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,448
- One of their own.
- One of their own.

1040
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,700
- So, they want to pretend...
- That you don't even exist, that's right.

1041
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,460
Okay. Yeah.

1042
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,980
- They still have to sit and listen.
- To you.

1043
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,500
Yes. You blew up their whole world.

1044
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,170
And yours, Julian.

1045
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,805
Yes. Mine.

1046
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:32,043
Because how can it be possible
that some African voodoo doctor

1047
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,411
could understand this subject
better than them?

1048
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,368
Or even better than you?

1049
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,580
Wait a second.
You think this is about Bennet Omalu?

1050
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,740
I'm not here because of you.
I'm here because people are dying.

1051
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,780
You are here for redemption.

1052
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,884
You are here to use me
to cleanse your sins.

1053
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,526
You self-righteous bastard.

1054
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,681
Do you have any idea what I could have,
how much I could have

1055
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,528
if I went back to my side of the ball
and just kept my mouth shut?

1056
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:10,445
Everything in my world is telling me
not to agree with you, except one.

1057
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,685
Science.

1058
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,885
So, here I am.

1059
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,203
Up here, beside you.
Not down there in that audience with them.

1060
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:25,408
What more can I do to prove myself to you?

1061
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,205
I am sorry.

1062
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,409
Convince them, Julian.

1063
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,820
You know, my father can't remember
a goddamn thing.

1064
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,365
He never played a day of football.

1065
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,611
He was too busy working in a factory,
you quack!

1066
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,820
I beg your pardon?

1067
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:29,780
You take your bullshit science,
go back to Africa.

1068
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,245
And get away from our game!

1069
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,451
What happened?

1070
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,484
Roger Goodell just said that

1071
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,087
Justin Strzelczyk may have
gotten his concussion swimming.

1072
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,220
In a swimming pool.

1073
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,700
That's insanity.

1074
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,700
This whole thing was staged.

1075
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,644
They needed to say that they heard us
so they could goddamn bury us.

1076
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,121
The science means nothing to them.

1077
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,540
This is an important day
in the National Football League.

1078
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,900
We've had some very good dialogue

1079
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,482
which will help us improve
the care for our players.

1080
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,900
What do you think when you hear about
former NFL players suffering from symptoms

1081
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,129
that has only seen in boxers
and people at over 80 years old?

1082
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,609
I mean, what does that say
about the effect of concussions on players?

1083
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:19,521
I'm not a doctor here, but you have to
look at their entire medical history.

1084
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,644
This is an evolving science.
And that's okay.

1085
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,420
While I agree with the Commissioner,

1086
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,844
no empirically determined proof
was presented today.

1087
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,283
Because there simply isn't any.

1088
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,020
Because according to
the NFL's own numbers,

1089
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:40,125
half of all players with concussions
are sent back into the same game,

1090
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,048
including some
who were actually knocked out cold.

1091
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:50,540
Ira Casson was head of the team of
NFL doctors who had looked into the issue

1092
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,645
and determined that the concern
over head injuries was overblown.

1093
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,725
Is there any evidence,
as far as you're concerned,

1094
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:03,047
that links multiple head injuries
among pro football players with depression?

1095
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,361
No.

1096
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:07,140
- With dementia?
- No.

1097
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,500
With early onset of Alzheimer's?

1098
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,647
No.

1099
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:14,208
Is there any evidence
as of today that links

1100
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:18,620
multiple head injuries
with any long-term problem like that?

1101
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,643
- In NFL players? No.
- Yeah.

1102
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,604
Hey, little one.

1103
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,329
This is your father.

1104
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,601
I am in deep shit.

1105
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,441
I have not done anything wrong,

1106
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,887
but I am being punished.

1107
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:22,205
It might not be so nice
when you get out here.

1108
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,487
You are still with God.

1109
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,565
Please ask Him to help me.

1110
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,168
It's all right. It's okay.

1111
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,685
- What is this?
- This is the FBI.

1112
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,700
Apparently, I'm being relieved
of my duties.

1113
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,380
What? I don't understand.

1114
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,100
Dr. Wecht has been indicted
on 84 federal counts, including...

1115
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,700
Please, please, Tex.
Let me at least have the joy of telling him.

1116
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,100
I'm being indicted on 84 federal counts,

1117
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:37,240
including mail fraud, wire fraud,
other related offenses, arising out of

1118
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:42,049
my use of government resources
to advance my private practice.

1119
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:46,491
Including, but not limited to
mileage vouchers,

1120
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:52,284
misuse of office stationery
and my personal use of the fax machine.

1121
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,740
- Faxes?
- Yeah.

1122
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,446
They could not come up
with something this stupid in Nigeria.

1123
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,924
This man has been a public servant
for decades.

1124
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:05,886
Cyril.

1125
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,740
Have you ever performed
any private services on county time?

1126
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,205
Have I?

1127
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,571
Apparently, we've both hurt
the government's feelings.

1128
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,060
Are you referring to the death row case
where I used my personal time?

1129
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:23,243
We don't want you, Dr. Omalu,
but we can have you.

1130
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,129
- And what does that mean?
- That means they want your testimony.

1131
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,763
- Against you?
- Yes.

1132
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,804
I understand.

1133
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,242
You are attacking him to get to me.

1134
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,086
I know.

1135
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,884
This is because his name
is on my research.

1136
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,451
What research is that?

1137
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,340
No. I will resign first.

1138
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,500
In which case,
your immigration status will be revised

1139
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,967
since your status requires
full-time employment.

1140
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,180
Then I will get another job
in another city.

1141
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:03,489
That would be fine.

1142
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,246
Bennet.

1143
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,969
All I asked is that if you did this,
we both came out okay.

1144
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:31,850
Not professional ruination.

1145
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:37,005
Whoever...

1146
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,761
Whatever takes over for me,

1147
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,162
they're going to want the CTE information,
you know that.

1148
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,688
What if they show up here with a warrant?

1149
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,020
On suspicion of what? Science?

1150
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,363
Suspicion of bullshit. We got screwed.

1151
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,003
You didn't deserve it.

1152
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:00,805
You know the worst part? How easy it was.

1153
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:05,569
Cyril, they are not going to
make me say one word against you.

1154
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,523
What are you gonna say?

1155
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,325
Cyril Wecht's a loudmouth asshole?

1156
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,681
I don't care. I'm tired.

1157
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,845
My balls are low.

1158
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,641
I didn't do good enough by you.

1159
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,406
Cyril.

1160
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,041
I cannot go back to Nigeria.

1161
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,970
Everything that I am is here.

1162
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,964
My child has got to be born in America.

1163
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,725
Don't worry.

1164
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,729
I'll get you a job.

1165
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:54,051
Hey, you can work with me
in the prison laundry.

1166
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,764
Call the surgeon.

1167
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:03,964
We need a goddamn drink.

1168
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,849
I solved the problem.

1169
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,460
All they have to do is
put on the side of the helmet,

1170
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,202
"The Surgeon General has determined that
playing football is hazardous to your health."

1171
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,322
You got to put it on both sides
of the helmet.

1172
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,020
Did you know that Paul Tagliabue,
this is the former Commissioner Tagliabue,

1173
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,220
did you know Paul was a partner
in Covington and Burling?

1174
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:36,420
Which is the same law firm that represented
the big seven tobacco companies.

1175
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,681
Of course he was.

1176
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,740
But now they're representing
the National Football League.

1177
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,490
Of course they do.

1178
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,100
My last year with the Steelers,

1179
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,522
we moved a game from a Sunday
to a Tuesday because of a blizzard.

1180
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,540
And the League said that they
weren't concerned about the ratings

1181
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,689
because the League
was immune from acts of God.

1182
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,361
Bennet!

1183
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,281
Bennet!

1184
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,140
I'm so sorry.

1185
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,049
There's no heartbeat.

1186
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,620
May we have the room, please?

1187
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,722
Excuse us. Thank you.

1188
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,405
I'm so sorry.

1189
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,330
I'm so sorry. I made a mistake.

1190
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,404
This is my fault.

1191
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,325
I wish I never met Mike Webster.

1192
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:14,083
They destroyed us.

1193
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:22,286
And I don't understand
why it is happening this way.

1194
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,203
Bennet, listen to me.

1195
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:34,488
Do you know what I chose to fake?

1196
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,847
You.

1197
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,362
We will have this family.

1198
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,087
Yes.

1199
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,365
We will.

1200
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,204
Just not here.

1201
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,564
We have to go.

1202
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,688
Hello? Mr. Omalu?

1203
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,140
Dr. Omalu.

1204
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:49,130
I just need the measurements
for the flat screens.

1205
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,443
That won't be necessary.

1206
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,446
Tell me what happened to you, Jose.

1207
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,726
Tell me.

1208
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,883
It's going to be okay.

1209
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,081
Listen.

1210
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,523
My mind keeps slipping.

1211
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:55,163
I can't seem to find
the goddamn words no more.

1212
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:56,886
What?

1213
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:02,885
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1214
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,443
I just can't do this.

1215
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,370
And I'm sorry.

1216
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,041
Yes.

1217
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,531
Bennet, it's Julian.

1218
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,241
Dave Duerson killed himself today.

1219
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:03,820
Shot himself in the chest. In the heart.

1220
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,570
Hold on, hold on.

1221
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,563
- My God.
- He left a note.

1222
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,488
He wants his brain to be donated.

1223
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:18,364
To be examined.

1224
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,809
They said that we were right.

1225
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,045
Benny, you there?

1226
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,409
Yes. Yes, I'm here.

1227
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:38,940
A Pro Bowler in that deep
with NFL leadership

1228
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:42,726
killing himself in the way he killed himself,
they can't explain this one away.

1229
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,163
Players are gonna want to
hear from you now.

1230
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,289
Trying to find the...

1231
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:16,641
I don't know what to say to them.

1232
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:23,760
Tell them what's really happening.

1233
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,801
Hello.

1234
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,327
A small boy came to me

1235
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:28,803
and said, "Mister,
why do you hate football?"

1236
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,607
I said, "I don't hate football."

1237
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,886
He said,
"Yes, my father said you hate football."

1238
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,002
I said, "You tell your father
to come see me."

1239
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:46,165
My wife watches the games.

1240
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:50,686
And she will scream and she will jump.

1241
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,321
She startles me a lot.

1242
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,368
But through her eyes, I can see the beauty

1243
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:04,401
and the grace, the power.

1244
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,367
I said to her
that I wished I'd never met Mike Webster.

1245
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,887
But that was before I knew him.

1246
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:34,004
He has given me a great gift.

1247
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,089
A dangerous gift.

1248
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,043
The gift of knowing.

1249
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:49,770
When a man is a soldier,
he knows what is at risk.

1250
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,324
He may be injured or even killed.

1251
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:02,684
But when a man is a football player,
he knows he may break his arm or his leg.

1252
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:08,449
He does not know
that he can lose his mind.

1253
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:12,811
His family, his money.

1254
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,525
His life.

1255
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,247
They have to know.

1256
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,490
Mike Webster.

1257
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,444
Justin Strzelczyk.

1258
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,171
Terry Long.

1259
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:35,530
Andre Waters.

1260
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,525
Dave Duerson.

1261
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:44,924
By dying, they speak for the living.

1262
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,163
And I speak for them.

1263
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,929
That is all I do.

1264
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,805
Forgive them.

1265
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,324
Forgive yourselves.

1266
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:11,610
Be at peace.

1267
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:20,643
Commissioner Goodell,
is there a link between

1268
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:24,729
playing professional football
and the likelihood

1269
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:28,003
of contracting a brain-related injury

1270
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:33,884
such as dementia, Alzheimer's, depression
or CTE?

1271
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:37,580
We're doing everything
we possibly can for our players now.

1272
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:40,940
I just asked you a simple question.
What's the answer?

1273
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:45,740
It sort of reminds me
of the tobacco companies, pre-'90s,

1274
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,220
when they kept saying,
"No, there's no link

1275
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,860
"between smoking
and damage to your health,

1276
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,740
"or ill health effects."

1277
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:56,380
And they were forced to admit
that that was incorrect

1278
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:59,180
through a spate of litigation
in the 1990s.

1279
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,203
And my question to you is...

1280
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:05,203
We have heard from the NFL
time and time again.

1281
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:09,180
You're always "studying,"
you're always "trying, " you're "hopeful."

1282
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,940
Son of a bitch.

1283
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:14,169
I want to know what are you doing
in the negotiations that are going on now

1284
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:18,928
to deal with this problem
and the other problems related to the injuries

1285
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:25,646
that football players obtain
and its impact on their health.

1286
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,020
You did all this.

1287
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:29,940
I know my time is drawing to a close,

1288
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:34,682
but let me just say this to Mr. Goodell
and everybody who's here today

1289
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:40,080
that I think it's time for the Congress
of the United States to take a look.

1290
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,961
- First time in Washington?
- Yes.

1291
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,140
We're thrilled you accepted
our invitation.

1292
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:50,561
I was very curious.

1293
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:55,180
Chief Medical Examiner
for Washington, D.C.,

1294
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:59,780
means you would also consult with the CIA
and FBI and any foreign government

1295
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:03,168
requesting the assistance
of the United States government.

1296
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:06,611
Essentially, you're America's
forensic pathologist.

1297
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:10,682
Wouldn't have to put on scrubs
or perform an autopsy.

1298
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,768
You're beyond all that now.

1299
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,180
Would you like to hear about
the benefits package?

1300
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,441
No.

1301
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:24,849
I mean, I'm sure it's fine.

1302
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:35,207
We know everything you did, Dr. Omalu.

1303
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:39,568
You exemplify everything it is
to be an American.

1304
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,723
You belong here with us,
in the nation's capital.

1305
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:01,441
Why don't you take a couple days
and think about it?

1306
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:36,401
Ready.

1307
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:40,241
Hut!

1308
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,082
Get up, get up field,
get up field, get up field!

1309
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:44,850
You heard him. Move up field, let's go!

1310
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,765
You, on the ball, on the ball.

1311
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:49,281
Okay, let's huddle up!
Bring it back, huddle up.

1312
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,643
All right, call it out!
Douglas, I'm talkin' to you.

1313
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:58,020
Hut!

1314
01:55:58,120 --> 01:55:59,406
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em!

1315
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:01,521
That's it. Good!

1316
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,210
There you go.
Good job, good job, on the ball.

1317
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,969
- Let's go, let's go, tempo, tempo!
- Tempo, tempo!

1318
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,008
How 'bout we hit somebody this time?

1319
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:17,244
Try a little more contact.

1320
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,401
One-sixteen, one-sixteen!

1321
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:50,924
A tragic loss for the family and fans
of former Chargers star Junior Seau

1322
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,726
after he was found dead
in his Oceanside home.

1323
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,660
Good evening
and thanks for joining us tonight.

1324
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,048
Junior Seau's death
is being investigated as a suicide.

1325
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,340
Police say his girlfriend
reported finding him

1326
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:04,820
with an apparently self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the chest.

1327
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:08,527
Tonight there's widespread shock
and disbelief over the sudden death.
