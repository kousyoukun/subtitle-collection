00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:15,558
"Reichenbach's film proves

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,601
"that despite robotism,

5
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:20,396
"the tendency towards
depersonalization,

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,941
"the threat of the plural
being victorious over the singular,

7
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:28,154
"the encroaching barracks
and symmetry synonymous with death,

8
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,033
"everywhere you go
you will find surprises, excesses,

9
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:33,951
"marvelous disorderliness,

10
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,204
"an instinct to disobey to the rules,

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,541
"a disobedience
which spares us the platitudes

12
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,211
"and keeps alive
the strange asymmetrical beauty

13
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,796
"of the human face."

14
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:02,688
AMERICA AS SEEN
BY A FRENCHMAN

15
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,770
I spent 18 months in America, seeking out
the mundane and the extraordinary.

16
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,356
My camera and I were welcomed
everywhere, even in prisons.

17
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,650
Nothing you are about to see
has been reconstructed.

18
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,611
I just wanted to show America
with its strict rules and indulgence,

19
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,656
its meticulous habits, its good faith,
its eternal desire for youth

20
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,408
and the freedom without which
a film like this could not be made.

21
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,966
San Francisco on the evening
of August 30th.

22
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:16,178
We enter America
by way of the Golden Gate Bridge.

23
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,821
This bridge has been said
to cross the void

24
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,032
with the exquisite audacity
of a spider's web.

25
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,160
This spider's web is solid.

26
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,911
It is also practicable.

27
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:45,207
A thousand cars are crossing it
at an even, orderly speed.

28
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,750
We drive.

29
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:51,213
We picked this bridge
somewhat randomly as our starting point,

30
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,674
perhaps simply because it is big,

31
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,343
in keeping with the big country
it opens onto.

32
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,019
All roads lead from here
to all possible Americas.

33
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,896
And they are all possible.

34
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,440
The one that produces,

35
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,400
the one that thinks,

36
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,027
the one that troubles,

37
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,695
or the one that tempts.

38
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,698
It is the moment of choice
and decision-making:

39
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,202
should we continue simply
scratching the surface of America

40
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,289
in a landscape, however beautiful,
that is merely a distraction,

41
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,041
or else shut our eyes

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,212
and abandon the set
and any preconceived ideas

43
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,674
to delve deeper
into the heart of America,

44
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,677
and only then,

45
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,888
open our eyes again

46
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,933
and wait for the people
to reveal themselves?

47
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:09,708
That's when, in the half-light,
we passed men, horses and carts:

48
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,835
a strange caravan
coming from the west

49
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:15,005
and seeming to emerge
from our childhood dreams.

50
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,883
When dawn broke,
there they were.

51
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,177
They filled the horizon.

52
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,560
Where have they come from?
Where are they going? Who are they?

53
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,730
They are ordinary citizens
of the city of Houston.

54
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,107
Most of them work in offices,

55
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,193
and once a year they don boots,
hire horses,

56
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,487
borrow carts from the museum

57
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,032
and embark solemnly
on a sort of pilgrimage

58
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,034
along the former salt route.

59
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,498
They are driven by a nostalgia
for adventure and heroic times.

60
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,000
For three days and three nights,

61
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,753
they will re-enact the exciting life
of the pioneers.

62
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,896
The Indians have almost
disappeared from the plains,

63
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,441
but their memory lives on
in the hearts of all Americans.

64
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,402
Their story began here
in these camps,

65
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,197
where these men of iron
overcame the cold and their fear

66
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,240
so their grandchildren
could come here to kiss

67
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,743
without fear
in a night without traps.

68
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,711
Early this March morning,

69
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:03,632
on a deserted beach
in Santa Monica in California,

70
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,510
two models must evoke
the pleasures of summer

71
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,471
for a publicity photograph.

72
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,348
They don't know one another.

73
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,017
An agency has brought them
together by chance.

74
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,001
Suddenly, by tacit agreement,
they become aroused.

75
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,878
Professional conscientiousness,

76
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,505
or are they just caught up
in their own game?

77
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:05,569
On an album cover
they will be together forever.

78
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,971
Glorifying a certain idea of happiness

79
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,933
is the first principle
of American advertising.

80
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,395
That's why so much work
is invested in it.

81
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,900
Photographers are the Sunday painters
of modern America:

82
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,069
cigarettes, camping equipment,

83
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,863
toothpaste and cars are all there,

84
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,950
like the donors in early paintings.

85
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:28,026
Another principle of advertising is
to recreate life through movement.

86
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,948
With millisecond precision,
the photographer will take a picture

87
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:37,411
which will illustrate the cover
of a calendar intended for GIs.

88
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,045
It was in these studios
that America created.

89
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,257
These images of tall girls,
painted like pharaohs' wives,

90
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,092
as upright as horses,

91
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,386
will determine
for women the world over

92
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,638
the universal canon of beauty,

93
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,266
at least for that year.

94
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,778
This water-skier is a model too.

95
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,870
We are at Cypress Garden,
a paradise for amateur photographers.

96
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,253
They don't mind if there are 150 of them
all taking the same shot,

97
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,382
a shot reproduced
on some excellent postcards nearby.

98
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,679
For a modest price, you can photograph
the world's most beautiful girls.

99
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,145
Or, if you prefer,
steal a shot of a forbidden orchid.

100
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,409
In every American
there is a photographer.

101
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,995
And in every photographer
there is always a tourist.

102
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,165
If you meet them,
don't be surprised

103
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,376
to see them touring the world
without looking at it.

104
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,546
Their Kodak is their memory.

105
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:17,219
Once they return to their armchairs,
their albums on their laps,

106
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,929
they will relax,

107
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,556
set about loving the world

108
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,017
and start traveling.

109
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,695
But when they travel
in their own country,

110
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,239
do they see the same America as us?

111
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,533
Do they see these frozen landscapes?

112
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,035
These strange inventions
which sometimes make us feel

113
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,079
as if we are visiting another planet?

114
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,291
Do they get a sense
of these still wild landscapes?

115
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,336
Do they have the same impression as us
that the scene has been set

116
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,923
and these vast horizons
are still waiting for something?

117
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,719
The Martians landing, perhaps,
or the return of the pioneers.

118
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,015
Half-machine, half-insect,

119
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,059
with that way machines have
of floating over the land

120
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,855
and that way insects have
of thinking with their mandibles,

121
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,815
the pioneers have returned.

122
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,820
The plain is not the countryside.

123
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:03,241
It is a vast desert which has been
tamed by these mechanics,

124
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,577
by these land engineers.

125
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,414
America has nine million farmers

126
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,583
but no peasants.

127
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,900
Gentle Mississippi with its showboats.

128
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,237
Walt Disney recreated it
on a smaller scale for children

129
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,364
in his kingdom of Disneyland.

130
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,294
Every day, 25,000 people visit
this world populated by automatons.

131
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,630
Here the Indians don't scalp.

132
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,467
The fire doesn't burn.

133
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,555
A cross between
storybook, farce, fair and zoo,

134
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,933
this is the universe in miniature
and the world of fairy tales,

135
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,894
where fake hippos
frighten real children.

136
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,701
And in the evening,
the boat returns effortlessly to port,

137
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,828
guided by rails.

138
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,621
America is composed
of a thousand artificial worlds.

139
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,707
Close to Los Angeles,
Ghost Town is a museum

140
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,752
dedicated to the heroic times
of the Far West.

141
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:22,339
The train ticket buys you
an attack by masked bandits

142
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,925
and a raid on a mail coach.

143
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,428
Extras imported from Hollywood
play their role conscientiously

144
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,723
and bring this ghost town to life.

145
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,894
You travel in a dream wagon
across a dream town.

146
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,396
You take in a dream adventure

147
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,191
and sit down next to your dream lover.

148
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,245
Here, everything is reconstructed.

149
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,415
But this lady is of the period.

150
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,876
She is the last remaining survivor
from the days of the American Civil War.

151
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,628
She is 104.

152
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,101
The Old Fiddlers have come

153
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,812
to soak up the atmosphere
of the past too,

154
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:05,358
and they end up being the most
authentic characters in this museum.

155
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:10,697
The real faces resemble
those in the cartoons.

156
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,616
You couldn't make them up.

157
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,329
You want an authentic
American grandma,

158
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,832
complete with Bible and apple pie?

159
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,001
Here she is.

160
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,046
Walt Disney should sign her up.

161
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,182
We are in a cell.

162
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,061
This man has committed two murders.

163
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,481
He has been sentenced
to 100 years in prison.

164
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,996
Every Sunday in October,
at Huntsville prison in Texas,

165
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,915
a rodeo takes place.

166
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,760
The guests arrive. They are prisoners
from neighboring towns.

167
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,637
They are dressed
in regulation white overalls

168
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,265
made from cotton
they have woven themselves.

169
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,226
We were permitted to watch
this strange ceremony

170
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,980
where the most dangerous criminals
were frisked before our very eyes.

171
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,445
The stadium is situated
within the prison walls.

172
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,822
It holds 25,000 spectators.

173
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,369
People come from far and wide
to watch this famously tough rodeo.

174
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:10,084
The biggest fans are soldiers
from the military academy.

175
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,031
Let the games commence.

176
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,042
There is no contest in the world
with higher stakes.

177
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,795
The prize for the most fearless
is a reduction in their sentence.

178
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,091
In the same way as bullfighters
kill their own death,

179
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,426
these prisoners sit astride
their own freedom.

180
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,592
After the two-hour show,
they all return to their prison.

181
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,928
The number written on their collar
allows for a register to be taken.

182
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,936
One last treat from Huntsville:

183
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:38,232
a hot dog in their right hand
and a hamburger in their left hand.

184
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,821
Part of the ticket sales will go
towards the prisoners' emergency fund,

185
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,699
and the rest will be used
to build their churches.

186
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,829
Thus provided for in the short term,
the future and for eternity,

187
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,956
the prisoners return to their cells.

188
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,184
Everyone takes a curious souvenir
away with them from this day.

189
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,529
First prize is a one-year reduction
in their sentence,

190
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,990
and second prize
a week's freedom with their wife.

191
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,618
What did this man win?

192
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,871
The memory of having been
a clown for a day.

193
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:44,340
Huntsville, a ruthless prison
but one without filth

194
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,509
and without rusty bars,

195
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,595
a prison without scorn which seeks
to chastise without debasing.

196
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,181
A mini America behind bars,

197
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,975
where you can put your money
in the bank

198
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,352
and go shopping at the drugstore.

199
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,234
Life continues
with its eternal need to produce.

200
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,363
In the prisoners' world,
it is threads.

201
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:13,035
And in the outside world,
car number plates.

202
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,978
Here, hope is never totally lost.

203
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,041
This enormous ice cream,
decorated like a bride,

204
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,836
is the first object of desire
for American boys.

205
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:09,151
There is a ceremonial element
to spinning pizzas too.

206
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:12,697
They fly through the air,
performing their dance of seduction.

207
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:14,592
Nearby, Tom, Dick and Harry
celebrate their joint coming of age.

208
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:17,011
Between them, they are 21 today.

209
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,642
<i>They were three little children</i>

210
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,269
<i>Who ate more than elephants</i>

211
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,772
<i>When they grow up, they will recite</i>

212
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,691
<i>This song by Michel Legrand</i>

213
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,285
<i>These triplets with their sly glances</i>

214
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,121
<i>Are destined to appear in adverts</i>

215
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,624
<i>We are filled with hope</i>

216
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,377
<i>On seeing them guzzle their snacks</i>

217
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,682
<i>It seems a strange job</i>

218
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,393
<i>But in America it's well paid</i>

219
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,020
<i>Believe it or not,
in this country</i>

220
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,981
<i>You can earn your bread and butter
from eating it</i>

221
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,789
Their sister isn't happy.
She wants some dessert too.

222
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,099
Mealtimes can be a party
or a competition.

223
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,729
The first to finish the blueberry tart
without using their hands

224
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,731
get to take part
in the watermelon contest.

225
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,169
Every sunny weekend is the occasion
for a giant barbecue.

226
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,100
Between Christmas and New Year's Day,

227
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,519
53,125,000 turkeys
and ten times as many chickens

228
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,813
are herded towards consumers.

229
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:37,276
And yet sometimes,
a miracle occurs.

230
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,612
Just look at this bird.

231
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,113
She is unique.

232
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,365
She is the advertisement
for a breeder.

233
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,159
He has trained her.

234
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,203
She plays skittles.

235
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:51,123
The aim of the game is
to release the grain into the trough

236
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,834
by raising all the skittles.

237
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:08,265
If she misses, she knows
there's no point looking for grain.

238
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,809
The skittles first.

239
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,481
The bird, saved by advertising,

240
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,984
is onto a good thing
as long as she stays in the limelight.

241
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,284
It's what's known
as a conditioned reflex.

242
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,920
Is this comely girl
the skittle or the grain?

243
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,797
That's not for us to decide.

244
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:43,217
At any rate, she is a good example
of conditioning.

245
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:48,597
Her role is to advertise a factory
that makes rescue apparatus.

246
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,725
They are relying
on the customer's subconscious

247
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:55,187
to associate the woman
with the apparatus in question

248
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:59,608
and to be vaguely expecting
to see her arrive on her stretcher

249
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,360
in the event of a fire,

250
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,279
inspiring confidence.

251
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:07,741
Inspiring also, perhaps,
a few budding arsonists.

252
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,329
But it's worth pointing out
that this lady has a husband

253
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,123
and he's a wrestler.

254
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,377
Here the advertisement
is more ceremonious.

255
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,255
And yet, it is just an advert
for the launch of a gym

256
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,049
where this golden athlete teaches.

257
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,624
As always, the majorettes
are part of the show.

258
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,337
The majorettes are a national institution.

259
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,674
No publicity parade,
no election campaign,

260
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,011
no demonstration goes by
without them putting in an appearance.

261
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:14,350
Their role is to enthuse the crowds.

262
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,907
If there is a majorette
in every American girl,

263
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,994
in every American boy
there is a musician.

264
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:19,248
Every university, every school,
every sporting association

265
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:25,921
has its band which marches in uniform
with military precision.

266
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,485
The Americans unite two sports

267
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,863
that we have a tendency
to keep separate:

268
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,282
football and insurrection.

269
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:23,604
The cheerleaders are there to direct
the cheers from the crowd.

270
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,357
Each of their gestures
has a precise meaning

271
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:31,570
and encourages the crowd
to encourage the players.

272
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,285
They are equally enthusiastic

273
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,662
whether they are defending
their school colors

274
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,289
or the American colors.

275
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:46,747
On the aircraft carrier Ranger
off the coast of Hawaii,

276
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:50,250
the sun left us alone
with these men of the future,

277
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,212
hungry for space and science-fiction.

278
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,256
These young men are trained

279
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,718
to overcome their fear
by dicing with death

280
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:04,223
and enjoy returning
to the simple pleasures of daily life.

281
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,606
At the Red Cross in New York,

282
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,900
these same men are given free lessons

283
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,028
to prepare these future fathers
for their future tasks.

284
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,947
Don't be fooled by their serious allure.

285
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,615
They are as bemused as you are

286
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,326
to find themselves
in this comical situation.

287
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,746
The Americans never miss
an opportunity to go to school.

288
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,915
You can learn at any age.

289
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,667
It's the best way to stay young.

290
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,880
After three weeks of lessons,
they will qualify as fathers.

291
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:41,677
These technicians and spacemen
apply themselves conscientiously

292
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:44,263
to learning how to handle babies.

293
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:49,142
With good humor and perhaps also
the sense that they face a reality

294
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,645
that no amount of progress
will permit them to dodge.

295
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,233
For, according to the wise words
of Dr. Von Braun,

296
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,653
it would be a mistake to think
that by getting nine women pregnant

297
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,614
you can have a baby in one month.

298
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:20,841
They are now ready to welcome
one of these babies into the world.

299
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,093
According to statistics,
babies are born in America

300
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,096
at a rate of one every 11 seconds.

301
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,849
To prove it, let's count together.

302
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:32,644
Eleven, ten, nine, eight,

303
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,480
seven, six, five,

304
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,483
four, three, two,

305
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,736
one, zero.

306
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:43,405
An American has just been born.

307
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,700
On the television screen
in the hospital,

308
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,828
he appears to his father
like breaking news.

309
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,625
The very latest.

310
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:06,636
We are at the pilot hospital
in Hialeah in Florida.

311
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,221
As soon as they are born,

312
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:11,892
the babies are classified
according to weight and size

313
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,645
and placed in an incubator
to protect them from infection

314
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:21,109
where they will ripen like melons
until they reach the statutory weight.

315
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,657
The new-borns soon transition
from this temporary state

316
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,785
where the television watches them

317
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,706
to a more permanent stage
where they watch the television,

318
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:38,460
which, moreover, broadcasts
special programs for babies.

319
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:29,177
What is the name of the river
which passes through Paris?

320
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:32,013
- It's the...?
- Seine.

321
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,099
The Seine, the River Seine.

322
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,145
Name the colors, please.

323
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,271
Yellow.

324
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:44,234
Orange, purple, brown, gray.

325
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:54,786
And so begins the golden age
of American life: childhood.

326
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:59,458
As soon as they can walk, children spend
most of their time with neighbors.

327
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:05,547
They are given total independence
to stop them becoming cry-babies,

328
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,008
an obsession of all American parents.

329
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,659
Did you know that
the first hula-hoop contests

330
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:19,204
took place under the paternal wing
of the police?

331
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,831
Parents had been worrying
for some time.

332
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:26,002
A generation of children,
stuck in front of the television,

333
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,547
were threatened with ankylosis.

334
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,966
The only effort they had to make

335
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:34,594
was to choose between
a Western or a cartoon.

336
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,223
Suddenly, here was a way
to get them into the great outdoors.

337
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:40,392
The police took the matter in hand

338
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:44,938
and set about generously distributing
hoops and microgrooves.

339
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,274
The children followed the movement.

340
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,527
The human race was saved!

341
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:01,700
The golden age is the only time
when magic is called by its proper name.

342
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:04,536
It is also the only time when
you only need to believe in miracles

343
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,204
for them to happen.

344
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,039
When pigeons fly.

345
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,541
Horses fly.

346
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,334
Angels fly.

347
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,378
Men fly!

348
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:15,273
After the golden age,
comes the age of the nickel.

349
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,650
Whatever the parents' position,

350
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:20,987
the child must earn a few dollars
of their own pocket money.

351
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,991
After school,
they do the evening paper round.

352
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,495
It is a familiar sight,
seen every day at the same hour

353
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,872
along the avenues
of all provincial towns.

354
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,625
The newspapers are thrown
with dexterity.

355
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,794
Other children receive them,

356
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:38,338
impatient to find out the latest news,

357
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:44,385
not news of those fictional characters
called Ike, De Gaulle and Khrushchev,

358
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:46,596
but news of the real heroes of this world:

359
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:50,225
Pogo, Superman, Dick Tracy,

360
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:53,019
and the little orphan, Annie.

361
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,587
The big event
in the children's calendar

362
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:24,342
is the Soap Box Derby
held every year in Akron, Ohio.

363
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:29,848
The day begins with the inevitable parade
of fanfares and majorettes.

364
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:34,769
Next is the moment thousands
of children have been waiting for.

365
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,145
The race begins.

366
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:40,400
These boys, aged eight to 14,
have built these cars themselves

367
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,902
from identical materials:

368
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:47,031
planks, wheels and nails
supplied by a tire company.

369
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,827
Preliminary rounds have selected
two boys from each state.

370
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,454
The winners will receive
a grant for their studies

371
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,790
and the promise,
when they're 20,

372
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,960
of a job as an engineer
in one of the tire factories

373
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,087
which has organized the competition.

374
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,864
It's time for the holidays.

375
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,074
Like in every country in the world,

376
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,911
the kids like to chase
after what is forbidden.

377
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:35,371
But here, they will not be punished.

378
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:38,583
Parents overlook
their children's bodily wounds

379
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:42,545
in order to avoid wounding their pride
or giving them complexes.

380
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,631
The child who runs the fastest

381
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:48,134
or the child who is the most daring
will be the most admired.

382
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,310
While they wait for real life to begin,

383
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,854
these young brains take a holiday.

384
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,440
And just as the blind see
with their hands,

385
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:05,276
these young Americans think
with their bodies.

386
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:22,061
The beach at Santa Monica
is called Muscle Beach.

387
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:36,659
He's trying to cover his shadow.

388
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,799
Beaches make transitions easier.

389
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:55,219
From childhood to adolescence,
for example.

390
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:58,431
From the robust, disordered life
of the under-13s

391
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,935
to that of teenagers,
aged between 13 and 20,

392
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:07,607
whose childish gestures
suddenly change.

393
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,751
On warm summer afternoons,

394
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:30,671
these supple teenage bodies
explore one another with gay abandon.

395
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,971
They don't talk much.

396
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:43,476
The spoken word isn't the main means
of expression for these boys and girls.

397
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:48,648
They have a more secret,
more pagan language of their own.

398
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,870
Once summer is over,
the schools open their doors again.

399
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,998
These are free schools
attended by rich and poor alike,

400
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:14,627
acting as a melting pot
for American democracy.

401
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,713
For the boys, there is the future
and the exam room.

402
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:21,676
For the girls too, of course.

403
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:25,930
But outside of lessons,
they must acquire other assets,

404
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:29,016
such as shapely legs
and winning smiles.

405
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:32,103
Friendship has trained them
for these tomboyish games

406
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:35,439
and a sporting reality
that will soon give way to love.

407
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,858
America is awash
with girls dressed in white,

408
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,403
racing towards a happy future.

409
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:11,350
At majorette school the students learn
their first moves in the art of seduction,

410
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:15,313
reminiscent of the mating flight
of birds and insects.

411
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:40,838
On the university lawn,
they secretly plan the final attack

412
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,049
which will lead to marriage.

413
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:45,760
Both sides observe one another.

414
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,435
The chosen ones will not be
those who are best at translation,

415
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,355
nor the smartest-dressed,
nor the cleverest,

416
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,776
but those who most resemble
Miss America,

417
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:04,570
who herself resembles
the all-American girl.

418
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:42,066
To be elected, Miss America must have
all the virtues of an American girl.

419
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:44,944
She must be a strong woman too.

420
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:16,976
At judo classes,
the defensive strategy

421
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:20,062
is the final stage
in this liberal education.

422
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:23,232
A defensive strategy
which, moreover, is perhaps

423
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,444
just an offensive strategy in disguise.

424
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:49,884
We find the caricature of seduction

425
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:53,679
at the College of Striptease
in Los Angeles.

426
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,182
Of course, the Americans
didn't invent nude women.

427
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,142
They existed before them.

428
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:02,646
But they were the first to think
of giving them theoretical training.

429
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,192
Here, women learn,
with apparently indefatigable aplomb,

430
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:10,946
the surprisingly complex rules
of the art of frustration.

431
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:15,784
Students learn to recognize
the subtle difference

432
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,703
between bold gestures
that are tolerated

433
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,039
and those that carry penalties.

434
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:23,584
They are constantly at the mercy
of a borderline incident,

435
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:27,630
of a line being crossed,
of disputed territory.

436
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:30,841
In other words, a no-man's land.

437
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,885
For striptease has its rules.

438
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,804
And from one state to the next,
from one town to the next,

439
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:40,184
the limits of immodesty vary
and different conventions apply.

440
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,728
Who comes to take these lessons?

441
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:47,942
Professional striptease artists
or amateurs seeking perfection

442
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:50,194
who have pondered
the words of Luther

443
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,656
when he says that sometimes,
in order to vanquish him,

444
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:56,408
you need to conceal your weapons
from the Devil.

445
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,694
Disconcerting America!

446
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:34,863
There is no other country

447
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,825
where the institution of marriage
is more respected.

448
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,828
And yet, there exists
in certain car parks

449
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:46,333
a chapel which offers motorists
in a hurry a fixed-price ceremony.

450
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:50,629
For a small supplement, an actress
playing the role of a family member

451
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,133
showers the newly-weds with lucky rice.

452
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,093
Honeymoon.

453
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,929
Disconcerting America!

454
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,931
These cement encampments,

455
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:04,310
these motels which have sprung up
along the roadsides like mushrooms,

456
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,520
would hardly seem
to suggest of Americans

457
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:11,025
that they are traditionally attached
to the intimacy of the family home.

458
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,822
Birds of a feather flock together.

459
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,783
The American nation
produces enough twins

460
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:24,246
for them to hold their own conference
every year in Huntington.

461
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,666
It is an opportunity for them
to savor the pleasure of assembling

462
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,376
and resembling one another.

463
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:20,154
Houses built on stilts,
streets made of duckboards.

464
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:22,990
This surprising island is Fire Island,

465
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:26,535
where the animals seem
to be holding a conference of their own.

466
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:09,536
The two main races in American society
live side by side here:

467
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:14,124
the dog race which is well-meaning,
sociable and excessively demonstrative,

468
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:19,046
and the cat race which is
more secretive, upright and darker

469
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:23,467
and whose attentive immobility conceals
reserves of movement and violence.

470
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:29,640
These children of violence,
these cat men, have an ideal:

471
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:32,100
to escape the day-to-day reality.

472
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,229
They are America's gypsies.

473
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:39,107
They cross the country, following
the seasons like migratory birds.

474
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:43,237
This motorcycling world
has its own heroes and myths.

475
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,615
Leathers, insulating tape,
boots and a guitar

476
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,868
are their emblem
and their rallying sign.

477
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:48,051
Elsewhere, more fans gather
along the roadsides,

478
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:52,222
waiting for the Hot Rods to pass by.

479
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:55,684
With old chassis bought
from the scrapheap for a few dollars

480
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,853
and engines boosted to the max,

481
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:00,731
DIYers in love with forbidden speed
and passionate about mechanics

482
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:04,401
build these racing cars
which travel at speeds of 155mph.

483
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,488
These races are a tranquillizer
for these young men,

484
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:12,034
frustrated all week by having
to stick to the 55mph speed limit.

485
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,710
"I go faster than the wind,
faster than the blood in my veins,

486
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,921
"faster than the sap in the tree,

487
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:27,841
"faster than the waters
of the Mississippi," said James Dean.

488
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:54,409
Every Sunday, America is filled with
the sound of games based on violence,

489
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,079
especially of the mechanical kind.

490
01:05:57,955 --> 01:06:00,624
All over the country,
cars zoom, motorbikes fly,

491
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,627
fairground rides go round and round.

492
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:34,241
It's a fine line
between pleasure and torment.

493
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:38,370
In another era, these iron wheels
would have been instruments of torture.

494
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:48,505
In all these forms of entertainment,
the accident remains accidental,

495
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:51,341
so there was a need to come up
with the deliberate accident,

496
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,802
the ragtime of abrupt ends,

497
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:57,055
the polka of catastrophes,
the ultimate challenge,

498
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:01,351
the contest of the Hell Drivers.

499
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,645
To swell our national pride,

500
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,273
these guys from Kansas
putting on a display here

501
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:08,233
are called "The Parisians".

502
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,622
Here is one of the Parisians in question.

503
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:26,460
He takes his act from show to show
with equal success.

504
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:29,421
It is as if this civilization,
based on comfort,

505
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,298
took childish pleasure

506
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:35,719
in seeing the symbols of that comfort
scorned and demolished.

507
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:09,961
There... the ceremony is over.

508
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:13,256
The children learn that cars die too.

509
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:37,364
She is said to be an Italian princess.

510
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:40,575
We'll never know exactly
what she was doing there,

511
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,619
surveying the rubble.

512
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,579
Looking for souvenirs, perhaps.

513
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:57,342
We'll never know exactly
what she was doing there.

514
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:02,264
We'll never know, either,
why these cars drowned.

515
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:42,053
At dawn, on the banks
of the Mississippi in New Orleans,

516
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:44,598
while the fog lifts,

517
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:49,811
these characters are waiting
for the black king's boat

518
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:53,523
to open the black carnival.

519
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:21,838
In the next neighborhood,
the white carnival is under way.

520
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:24,049
We've seen black men
made up as black men.

521
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:26,593
Here are women
dressed as naked women.

522
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:36,019
But while their bodies
are dressed in plastic bodysuits,

523
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:38,188
their souls are stripped bare.

524
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:41,566
This is a far cry
from our tired Lent carnivals

525
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,444
where people dress up out of habit
and somewhat haphazardly.

526
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:52,410
Here, the carnival has lost
none of its intensity.

527
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:56,164
The disguise is a confession,
the mask a secret.

528
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:37,122
The carnival has been parading
obscene lamentations all day.

529
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:40,375
Ash Wednesday is about to start
in a few hours.

530
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,169
Everything must be
restored to order by dusk.

531
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,713
It is then, as night falls,

532
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:48,508
that the strangest characters
start to emerge.

533
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,108
The teenagers spend the night waiting.

534
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:09,612
A wait which sometimes ends in theft.

535
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,574
It is as if they needed it
to feed a part of themselves

536
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:16,161
with the only thing they haven't
yet experienced: punishment.

537
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,922
At Houston police station,
there is an identity parade.

538
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:32,886
Six boys are suspected
of having robbed a garage.

539
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:36,514
From the shadows, a witness looks on
and points out the culprit.

540
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:12,091
There.

541
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,761
It was him.

542
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:45,250
Every night, dozens of kids
file through here,

543
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,293
guilty of crimes
that are more or less explicable,

544
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:50,964
but also of acts of violence
that are gratuitous and crazy.

545
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,057
In the eyes of the American creed,
they have all the vices.

546
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:05,478
Laziness, brutality
and, worst of all, unhappiness.

547
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,773
In their stubborn silence,

548
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,609
they shout in the faces
of their parents and teachers

549
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:14,153
that all is not well,
that life is not easy.

550
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:18,324
Their gangs speak
of nostalgia for community,

551
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:20,785
their cruelty speaks
of nostalgia for love.

552
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,268
In the void they couldn't fill,

553
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:47,895
humans are raising
these pathetic creatures.

554
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,046
Those who are too hard
to be returned to their parents

555
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,173
spend some time in a prison cell.

556
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:00,677
It barely touches them.

557
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:04,347
They have the patience of a rock
and the same indifference.

558
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:22,490
Our inquisitive presence among them
doesn't seem to surprise them

559
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,575
or to irritate them.

560
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,244
They are elsewhere.

561
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:29,122
They are on a journey.

562
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,376
Like all dreams,
the prisoner's dream is ephemeral.

563
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:18,087
It dissipates
with the first light of day

564
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:21,632
and the strange ceremonial of the meal
served to the guilty children.

565
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:04,592
America believes the prophets
when they speak the language of the Bible.

566
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,763
As for the refusal to speak
of these opaque young minds,

567
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:12,600
perhaps in response to the din
of those speaking in their name,

568
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:16,979
God's silence is the only language left
for making prophesies.

569
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,984
That's why in this country
that is so apparently happy,

570
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,987
content with thinking
that there is paradise on earth,

571
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:28,032
we sometimes felt,
like an impatience to be elsewhere,

572
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:32,245
the call of an invisible world,
of a new America to discover.

573
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,132
Is this dream America
at the end of the desert?

574
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:48,261
Or at the end of life?

575
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,390
The paths leading to God are infinite.

576
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:54,350
The ways of calling
upon his salvation too.

577
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:03,776
The Holy Rollers are Christians.

578
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,903
The temples of this sect are open to all.

579
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,115
The faithful are not visionaries
but believers,

580
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,950
who want to purge themselves
of their sins

581
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:14,120
and, through this pious swaying,
chase the demon from their souls.

582
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,324
Elsewhere, other cults light up.

583
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:38,955
This need to give a physical form
to the fervor shown by the Holy Rollers

584
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:42,083
is apparent across America
in the dance of lights.

585
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:05,815
We sensed it from our first contact
with the world of advertising.

586
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:09,402
Marketing is an excuse
for creating beauty.

587
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:14,198
And the beauty amounts to more
than the pleasure it gives.

588
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,325
It is an offering to the gods.

589
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:23,290
American nights, with their comets
and imaginary zodiac,

590
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:25,835
are full of these offerings.

591
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,964
We are driving to Las Vegas,
amidst the colorful constellations

592
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:32,091
of cinemas and casinos,

593
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:36,220
set in motion by our speed
like a procession greeting us.

594
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,274
Las Vegas, the most illuminated city
in the world,

595
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:51,527
founded in the middle
of the vast Nevada Desert,

596
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:55,197
is the capital of gambling and luck.

597
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,159
Luck.

598
01:23:58,284 --> 01:24:00,911
The prisoner in his prison.

599
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:04,040
The little boy with his ice cream.

600
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:06,751
The black man at his carnival.

601
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:09,003
The girl with her plans.

602
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:11,130
Luck.

603
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:12,673
Their luck.

604
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:17,344
This gift bestowed
on each American citizen at birth

605
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:20,431
that they carry with them
along the paths of life,

606
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:24,101
like a guarantee of happiness,
always within arm's reach,

607
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:25,770
no matter what.

608
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,526
In the casinos of Las Vegas,

609
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,779
where the law permits people
to gamble for money,

610
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:39,408
eight million people a year
pray to Lady Luck.

611
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:44,872
Her sign is the dollar and
her slot machines are the prayer wheels.

612
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:08,854
San Francisco, Louisiana, Texas...

613
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:14,276
America, if I'm not lost
in your mazes,

614
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,904
it's because I haven't tried
to understand,

615
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,406
nor to deduce, nor to explain.

616
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:25,246
It's because, if I may be so bold,
I loved you, purely and simply.

617
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:49,562
New York, accused of being a city
without a heart or a past,

618
01:25:49,687 --> 01:25:54,108
in your reflections I discovered
your treasures and your cathedrals.

619
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:39,463
New York, November 18th.
We are leaving America.

620
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,548
The one we saw.

621
01:27:41,674 --> 01:27:45,010
For there are as many Americas
as there are people observing it.

622
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:46,845
Everyone makes their own discovery,

623
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:49,682
and, mark my words,
they only make it for themselves.

624
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,519
We are quite ready
to see this city and this country

625
01:27:53,644 --> 01:27:56,814
as a huge shop
whose slogan might be,

626
01:27:56,939 --> 01:28:00,234
as we read on the front
of a real shop:

627
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:04,905
"If you don't know what you want,
come in because we have it."

628
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,369
But it would be too easy
to confine America to its strangeness.

629
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:14,957
This way of life, so often criticized
but so often imitated,

630
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:18,294
is the human art
of subjugating to their powers

631
01:28:18,419 --> 01:28:20,671
what they thought was their fate.

632
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:26,010
It might be the fate
of the whole of Europe in 20 years.

633
01:28:26,135 --> 01:28:28,721
And if it is to be ours,

634
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:32,349
perhaps it was worthwhile
giving it due consideration.
