1
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:58,977
赴汤蹈火
Hell or High Water

2
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:10,777
美国 2016
犯罪/剧情

3
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,768
别出声，打开门
Quiet,Open the door,open the door

4
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,240
什么？
What?

5
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,378
到底怎么回事？
What in the devil?

6
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,614
你能站起来，带我们到现金抽屉那里么？
Can you please stand up and take us
to the cash drawer, ma'am?

7
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,781
我不会的
I will not

8
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,683
这可不是请求
We ain't asking

9
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,785
现在抽屉里还没有钱
There's no money in the drawers yet

10
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,821
在保险柜里，我没有密码
It's in the safe and i ain't got the code

11
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,890
看一下，抽屉
Prove it Drawer!

12
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:39,858
这里
Here

13
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,494
打开抽屉
Open the drawer

14
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,929
我需要钥匙，钥匙
I need the keys, Keys

15
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,604
靠后
Step back

16
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,176
妈的
Shit Damn it!

17
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,645
你们是新手，我猜
Y'all are new at this,I'm guessing

18
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,846
钱在哪里？
Where's the money?

19
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,381
我说过钱在保险柜里
I told you,it's in the safe

20
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,615
好吧，谁有密码
Well, who has the code?

21
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,884
Mr clauson

22
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,654
他快来了，我建议你们不要这么做
He'll be here soon and I suggest you fellas don't be

23
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,557
目前为止你们的罪行顶多是太蠢
All you're guilty of right now is being stupid

24
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,392
现在就离开，什么事都没有
Just leave and that's all it'll be

25
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,664
再说一次我蠢？
Tell me I'm stupid again

26
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,337
Mr clauson啥时候来？看着我！夫人
What time does Mr clauson get here?
Ma'am, look at me

27
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,372
Mr clauson什么时候来这里？
What time does Mr clauson get here, huh?

28
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,474
每天早上八点半
8:30 every morning

29
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,578
走起来
We're walking

30
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,782
坐下
And sit

31
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,617
你觉得你能去哪里？
Where do you think you're going?

32
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,985
坐在地上
Sit on the floor!

33
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,302
你才蠢呢
You're stupid

34
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,815
这不关你事，亲爱的
This ain't about you, darling

35
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,823
Elsie，你还好吗？
Elsie, you all right?

36
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,928
早上好
Good morning

37
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,973
你不必揍他
You didn't have to hit him

38
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,375
哇！
Whoo!

39
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,016
慢点 -我没有超速
Slow down I ain't speeding

40
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,390
看，小兄弟，无忧世界
See, little brother,not a worry in the world

41
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,526
计划和实干是两件不同的事情
Planning this and doing it is two
different things

42
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,995
也许我们应该提前去那里
Maybe we should get there ahead,
get up to olney

43
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,532
早期的鸟儿有虫吃
Early bird gets the worm

44
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,574
- 慢点 - 我没有超速
- Slow down
- I ain't speeding

45
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,565
我在谷仓里找到这些硬币
I found these coins in the barn

46
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,034
上帝知道它们在那里多长时间了
Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there

47
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,370
我一直活的清苦
I've been living off an inmate's diet,

48
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,871
守着这些硬币
and had all these coins

49
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,441
就在一堆饲料袋的下面
sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks

50
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,411
上面写着1953年
This one says 1953

51
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,013
1953?

52
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,015
我觉得也许有些收藏价值
I wonder if any of
these is collector's items

53
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,850
你也许坐拥宝藏呢
You could be sitting
on a fortune here

54
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,052
我希望吧
I hope so

55
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,821
早上好，伙计们，打开抽屉
Good morning, folks
Open the drawer!

56
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,390
打开他妈的抽屉！
Open the motherfucking drawer!

57
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:01,560
1块的，5块的，10块的，20块的,不要成百的，不要成捆的
Ones, fives, 10s, 20s, no hundreds, no bundles

58
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,527
你们这些孩子抢银行？
You boys robbing the bank?

59
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:02,527
闭嘴
Shut up

60
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,097
把你的手放在柜台上
Put your hands on the counter On the counter

61
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,432
是的，先生，就那样
Yes, sir, That's it, come on

62
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,035
疯了，你们甚至都不是墨西哥人
That's crazy
y'all ain't even Mexicans

63
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,503
呜呜
Uh-uh, uh-uh

64
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,638
不要成捆的，只要零钞
No bundles, Just loose cash

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,940
好的
Okay

66
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,808
你们应该知耻啊
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves

67
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,110
手放在柜台上我能看到的地方
Hands on the counter where I can see them!

68
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,112
是的，先生
Yes, sir

69
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,880
老头，你带枪了？
You got a gun on you, old man?

70
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,416
你他妈说对了，我带枪了
You're damn right i got a gun on me

71
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,884
你要缴他的枪? 对
Are you gonna get his gun? Yeah

72
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,686
看清形势，好吗？
Keep up with the circumstances, okay?

73
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,954
我找到了
Yeah, I got it

74
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,822
你们连我的枪也偷？
So y'all gonna steal my gun, too?

75
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:30,822
我自己有枪
I have my own gun

76
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,659
我们不会偷你的，我们只是偷银行
We ain't stealing from you
We're stealing from the bank

77
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,796
承蒙关照
Much obliged

78
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,433
快走
Let's go!

79
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,667
我们很抱歉，伙计们
We're sorry about this, folks

80
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,505
肮脏的婊子养的
Dirty, rotten sons of bitches

81
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,809
干你，老头！
Fuck you, old man!

82
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,977
走，走
Go, run, go!

83
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,462
把枪放在柜台
Put the gun on the counter

84
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,596
你想要害死我们吗？
You trying to get us killed?

85
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,798
我不会偷一个老人的
I ain't stealing from some old man

86
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,966
我们偷一个机构，就那样
We're stealing from one place, that's it

87
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,501
你正在变成一个可怜的罪犯
You're turning out to be a poor-ass criminal

88
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,836
哦，去你妈的
Oh, fuck you

89
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,206
哇
Whoo!

90
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,876
看早起的鸟得到了什么？
See what the early bird gets?

91
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,480
也许我们应该抢Jayton的那一家银行？
Maybe we should hit that branch in jayton?

92
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,582
不，我们不我们抢那些银行
No, we ain'tWe hit those banks

93
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,683
最重要的就是早晨，当他们还没人的时候
first thing in the fucking morning,
when they're empty

94
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,751
当他们还没有人的，妈的
When they're empty,god damn it

95
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,786
好的
All right

96
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,557
这应该是我们最后一次被枪打
It's the last time I care to be shot at

97
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,659
我们应该聪明点，我们随时会完蛋
We got to be smart，We're a ways from being finished

98
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,661
妈的，我能整周都做这个
Shit, I can do this all week

99
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,962
我们会的
We're gonna

100
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,664
我们喜欢克曼奇，小兄弟
We're like the comanches, little brother

101
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,533
抢我们想要抢的地方
raiding where we please

102
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,203
让整个德州都在我们的阴影之下
with the whole of Texas hunting our shadow

103
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,506
主的平原
Lord of the plains

104
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,542
呜呜！
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

105
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,944
拿开手
Hands off， Fuck off!

106
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,179
你听说过这些银行抢劫吗？
You hear about these bank robberies?

107
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,817
为什么你穿的和我一样？
Why are you always dressed like me?

108
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,754
这是制服
This is our uniform

109
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,623
我们没有制服
We ain't got no uniform

110
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,224
你可以穿喜欢的衬衫
You can wear whatever color shirt you choose

111
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,260
你正好挑选了我的颜色
You just keep choosing mine

112
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,929
游骑兵条例要求是白色、蓝色或者黄色衬衫
Ranger regs say white, blue, or tan dress shirts

113
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,264
基于这个理由
Stands to reason every once in a while

114
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,266
我们将会穿的一样
we're gonna be dressed the same

115
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,235
好吧，你知道什么是模仿吧，Alberto？
Well, you know what they say about imitation, Alberto

116
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,872
你到底要不要听这个银行抢劫的案子
You wanna hear about these bank robberies,

117
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,341
或者你就干脆坐着，让阿尔茨海默查案子
or you just sit there and let Alzheimer's run its course

118
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,776
发生在哪里？
Where are they at?

119
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,647
德州Midlands银行，在Archer城的分行，还有Olney的分行
Texas MidlandsBranch in Archer city
and the branch in olney

120
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,315
FBI需要协查？
FBI want an assist?

121
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,951
Midlands在德州以外没有分行
Midlands ain't got any branches outside Texas

122
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,621
此外，他们仅仅拿抽屉里的现金，也就几千块
Plus, they're just hitting the drawers
for a few thousand

123
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,922
FBI看不上
FBI don't want it

124
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,060
你也许可以找点乐子
You may get to have some fun

125
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,829
在他们把你送到自动轮椅上之前
before they send you off to the rocking chair yet

126
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,652
我需要你保持戒酒
I need you sober

127
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,953
谁他妈喝光了这瓶啤酒的？
Who the hell gets drunk off a beer?

128
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,427
这里烂透了
Place looks like shit

129
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,129
你还有别的话说么？
You got anything else you wanna say?

130
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,031
连个好的牛排馆也没有
There's not a decent steak

131
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,000
在这个地方到处都是混蛋
in the whole lot of them,the sorry sons of bitches

132
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,669
是的，当你忙着坐牢的时候
Yeah, well, while you were busy in jail

133
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,103
我一直忙着照顾妈妈
I was busy looking after mama

134
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,271
所以你就能瞎搞
so you can go fuck yourself

135
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,251
她在那个床上待了多久？
Was she in that bed a while?

136
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,289
3个月
Three months

137
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,840
最后是相当的难受的
The end there was pretty rough

138
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,779
即便她要求我也几乎帮不上忙
I could've helped out a little if she asked

139
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,416
我也不会喂瘦的皮包骨的牛
I could've fed them skinny cows

140
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,089
我们也没有饲料喂它们
We had nothing to feed them

141
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,091
好吧，我能帮忙收拾一下屋子
Well, I could've helped clean up the house a bit

142
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,796
我不会带着你去打扫屋子的
I never took you for the go-to guy
for house cleaning

143
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,066
不，只是抢银行
NoJust robbing banks

144
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,234
是的
Yeah

145
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,284
去她的，反正她从来也不待见我
Fuck her She never wanted nothing to do with me anyway

146
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,462
她有什么遗愿？
She leave a will?

147
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,234
有
Yeah

148
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:51,803
有我的份吗？
Am I in it?

149
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,544
没有
The will don't matter

150
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,348
她把一切都给了我
She left everything to me

151
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,049
到周五的时候我就把它给我的儿子了
By Friday it all goes to my boys

152
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,255
这个并不说明什么
She didn't mean nothing by it

153
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,525
这他妈说明了一切
She damn sure meant it

154
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,460
她一直恨我因为我支持他
She always hated me for standing up to him

155
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,030
我们都得到了惩罚
We all got punished

156
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,399
你总是不明白反抗越激烈，她打你的时间就越长
You never understood that fighting back makes
the beating last longer

157
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,402
不，我理解
No, I understood

158
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,105
那就是为什么我停止了反击，然后开枪射了那个混蛋
That's why I stopped fighting and shot
that son of a bitch

159
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,074
嗨，发生什么事情了？
Hey, what's going on?

160
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,876
今天早上有人抢了银行
Somebody robbed the bank this morning

161
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,477
干了什么？
Do what?

162
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,614
如果你看到可疑的人，给我电话
If you see anyone looking a little sideways
give me a call

163
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,549
我一般不抄近道走小路
Sideways don't wanna meet me

164
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,151
那明摆着是不安全的
Find itself on the wrong end of a short rope

165
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:51,389
哦，那大家都干的事情就是你例外
Oh, well, that would simplify things for
everyone but you

166
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,125
也许，如果你能找到一棵树的话
Maybe, if you can find the tree

167
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,631
上帝上，我爱死西德州了
God, i love west Texas

168
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,904
骑警？嗨 是的
Ranger? Hi there

169
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,006
不是大额抢劫案
Wasn't much of a robbery

170
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,008
数额在7000美元以下
got off with just under $7,000

171
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,310
仅仅拿了抽屉里的钱，20块以下的
Took the drawer money, 20s and under,

172
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,078
只是一些零钞
only loose bills

173
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,580
没有墨水的？ 没有
No ink pack? Nope

174
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,515
聪明
Smart That was smart

175
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,018
能看一下录像吗？
Can we get a look at the video?

176
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,553
这是银行经理，Mr clauson
Let me introduce you to the bank manager, Mr clauson

177
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,425
这是骑警Hamilton
This here is ranger Hamilton

178
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,060
-骑警  -先生
-Ranger -Sir

179
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,596
能看一下监控录像吗？
Can we get a look at the surveillance video?

180
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,531
我们有个摄像头
We got cameras

181
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,266
但是他们给我们更换了数字系统
but they're switching us over to a digital system

182
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,580
没有墨水包？ 没有
No ink pack? Nope

183
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,515
聪明，真TMD聪明
Smart，That was smart

184
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,018
能看一下录像吗？
Can we get a look at the video?

185
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,553
这是银行经理，Mr clauson
Let me introduce you to the bank manager
Mr clauson

186
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,425
这是骑警Hamilton
This here is ranger Hamilton

187
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,060
-骑警 -先生
-Ranger -Sir

188
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,596
能看一下监控录像吗？
Can we get a look at the surveillance video?

189
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,531
我们曾经有个摄像机
We got cameras

190
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,266
但是他们给我们更换了数字系统
but they're switching us over to a digital system

191
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,668
记录到电脑里
that feeds into the computer

192
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,437
这些新的摄像头没有和我们的录像机相连
These new cameras don't hook to our vcrs

193
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,372
打电话给Young县警长
Call over the young county sheriffs

194
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,608
看他们是否知道怎么弄出来视频
Ask them if they thought to hook their cameras

195
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,343
或者有类似的录像设备
to some sort of recording device

196
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,214
带枪了？ 是的，先生，手枪
Armed? Yes, sir Pistols

197
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,082
哦
Oh

198
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,018
蒙面？
Faces covered?

199
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,955
滑雪面罩，套头衫，休闲裤……
Ski masks, sweatshirts, baggy pants

200
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,723
就像达拉斯的那些暴徒
Uh-huh Like them thugs in Dallas

201
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,657
也许是吸毒的？
Tweakers maybe?

202
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,693
也许
Maybe

203
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,629
对那些吸毒的人来说有点早
A little early in the morning for tweakers

204
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,032
吸毒的不睡觉，就是吸
Tweakers don't sleep They just tweak

205
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,402
他们抢劫药店和路边的车，而不是银行
They rob drug stores and parked cars, not banks

206
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,603
我能看看里面吗？
Can I take a look inside?

207
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,172
可以，先生
Yes, sir

208
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,040
好的，我来了，Margaret
Yeah,I'm here, Margaret

209
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,176
他们给了你的鼻子一拳，是吗？
So they bopped you on the schnozzola, huh?

210
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,077
是的，先生
Yes, sir

211
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,245
不是很好
Not very nice

212
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,716
我知道他们蒙面
I know their faces was covered,

213
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,385
但是你能说出他们的种族吗？
but could you tell their race?

214
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,686
黑人，白人？
Black, white?

215
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,490
他们的皮肤还是他们的灵魂？
Their skin or their souls?

216
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,993
让我们暂时不管他们的灵魂
Let's leave their souls out of this for now

217
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,562
白人
White

218
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:41,132
我猜测也就是这附近的人
From around here somewhere is my guess,

219
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,567
听口音
you know,from their voices

220
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,268
哦？
Oh?

221
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,636
Young县也发生了同样的事情
Young county says same deal

222
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:46,504
位于Olney的分行
with the branch in olney

223
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,605
抱歉
Excuse me

224
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,209
他们有录像吗？
Do they have video?

225
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,078
也一样
Same deal all the way around

226
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,448
沃尔玛卖的不是一样的电子设备？
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts of electronic equipment?

227
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,285
我的观点是……拿开你的手
My word Get your hands off that

228
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:05,723
好吧，这些家伙，应该不会收手
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet
I'll tell you that

229
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,759
为什么那么说？ 他们很有耐心
How come? Well, they're patient

230
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,528
只是拿抽屉的钱
Just sticking to the drawers

231
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,530
不拿百元大钞，那是银行的钱
not taking the hundreds, that's the bank's money

232
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,499
我们能追踪的大额的钱
we can trace that

233
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,702
他们想要凑够一定的数额，我猜测
They're trying to raise a certain amount,
that's my guess

234
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,704
他们需要多抢几家
It's gonna take a few banks to get there

235
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,653
你们知道他们能多有钱吗？
Your boys know how rich they're gonna be?

236
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,058
他们还什么都不知道
They don't know anything yet

237
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,394
你带他们去的葬礼？
You take them to the funeral?

238
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,698
我说过了，他们什么也不知道
Like I said,they don't know anything

239
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,337
你上次是什么时候见的他们？
When's the last time you saw them?

240
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,578
你出来以后我们一起去Stamford看表演的时候
When we all went to the rodeo in stamford
right after you got out

241
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,451
那是大约一年前，我通过电话和他们谈的
That was a year agoI talk to them on the phone

242
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,718
你通过电话和他们谈的？
You talk to them on the phone?

243
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,324
你需要一点建议吗？ 不，不，我不需要
You want a little advice? No No, I don't

244
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,193
明天去看看他们
Go see them tomorrow

245
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,300
你知道我欠Debbie多少给孩子的抚养费吗？
You got any idea how much I owe Debbie
in child support?

246
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,568
你已经给了足够多了
You've got enough in your front pocket

247
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,869
现在立刻解决这个问题
to fix that problem right now

248
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,107
我们不能浪费它，你知道的
We can't spare it,you know that

249
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,110
也许我们应该抢另外一家银行
Maybe we should hit another branch

250
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,618
你说的好像我们不能摆脱这一切似得
You know, you talk like we ain't gonna
get away with this

251
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,856
我从来没有遇到过能摆脱这一切的人，你呢？
I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever You?

252
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,395
那么你到底为什么同意做这个呢？
Then why in the hell did you agree to do it?

253
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,532
因为你开口了，小兄弟
Because you asked,little brother

254
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,208
我去个厕所
I got to shit like an old goat

255
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,911
拿着支票，前门见
Grab the check,meet me out front

256
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,287
如果那不是一个暗示的话
Well,if that isn't a hint

257
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,488
我不知道怎么回事
I don't know what is

258
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,694
喜欢你的牛排吗？
You like your steak?

259
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,396
是的，夫人
Yes, ma'am

260
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,499
好吧，你已经找到一个离开的方法了
Well, you've got a ways to go yet

261
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,769
你要一直等我们吃完
Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day for me
to finish this

262
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,905
我会一直在这里不管你吃完还是没有吃完
I'll be here whether you finish it or not So

263
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,641
所以，不用着急
You take your time

264
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,484
别出声
It sure is quiet in here

265
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,721
打开抽屉，给我5块的、10块的、20块的
Open the drawer Fives, 10s, 20s

266
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,290
象扑克牌一样洗一下
Fan them out like a deck of cards

267
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,293
你是干什么的？
What do you do?

268
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,501
上一份工作是……
Last job was for a

269
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,769
天然气公司
Natural gas company

270
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,405
听上去挣得不少
Sounds high-dollar

271
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,842
干钻探的挣不着钱
No, there ain't nothing high-dollar about drilling

272
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,245
现在没人钻探天然气了
No one seems to be drilling for gas now, anyway

273
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,614
他们都在钻石油了
They sure drilling for oil

274
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,549
我的意思是，没人会总钻探一种东西的
I mean, ain't one drill the same as the next?

275
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,320
看来是我的问题了
That's my take on it

276
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,224
我猜，我得让别人相信我
I guess, I got to get someone else to believe me

277
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,425
混蛋
Son of a bitch!

278
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,861
我们需要个厨师
We could use a cook

279
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,501
想到什么说什么了
Just a thought

280
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,638
上菜，Jenny Ann
Order's up, Jenny Ann

281
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,511
再见
Bye

282
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,501
发动汽车
Start the car!

283
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,803
妈的
Shit

284
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,744
妈的
Fuck! Shit!

285
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:20,911
快走
Go, go, go!

286
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,066
我打赌这次你不欠孩子的抚养费了
I bet you don't owe this much in child support

287
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,801
我一定是脑子进水了才找你帮忙
I must be out of my goddamn mind to ask you for help

288
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,873
你想要害死我们吗？
You wanna get us killed? Huh?

289
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,907
那个不是Midlands银行
That's not a Midlands branch

290
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,909
那不是计划中的
That's not part of the plan

291
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,712
现在，我们得回农场，埋掉汽车，妈的！
Now, we got to go back to the ranch
and bury the car Fuck!

292
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,681
不，我们不用，我们到Oklahoma已经走了一半了
No, we do notWe're over halfway to Oklahoma

293
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,015
我不要开一辆偷来的车
I'm not driving a stolen getaway car

294
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,951
去他妈的印第安赌场
to a fucking Indian casino

295
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,787
你让我们晚了一天
You just put us a goddamn day behind

296
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,556
今早我让我们提前了一天，扯平了
Well, I got us a day ahead this morning
so I guess we're even

297
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,091
- 你该说谢谢  - 去你的
You're welcome Fuck you

298
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:17,068
你就不能接一下你的电话？
Can't you answer your own phone?

299
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,806
我在开车呢，而你坐在一边掰指头玩
I'm drivingYou're just sitting there
twiddling your fat fingers

300
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,076
骑警Hamilton的电话
Ranger Hamilton's phone

301
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,388
真是太鲁莽了……
It's reckless is what it is Oh

302
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,388
是吸毒的，我说过
It's tweakers I'm telling you

303
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,990
我不认为那些孩子是鲁莽的
I don't think these boys is reckless

304
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,526
绝对不是吸毒的
Damn sure ain't tweakers

305
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,395
他们清楚的知道自己在做什么
They know exactly what they're doing

306
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,664
我不知道你是怎么活下来的
I don't know how you're gonna survive

307
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,400
如果没有别人帮你想事情的话
without somebody to outsmart

308
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,836
你需要一个爱好
You need a hobby,and quick

309
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,038
来一匹马怎么样？
How about a horse?

310
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,542
Mary Beth是骑师
Mary Beth was the rider

311
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,045
一匹马只能让我想起她
A horse would only remind me of her

312
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,516
你应该去钓鱼
You like to fish

313
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,421
也不能天天去钓鱼啊
Not enough to do it every goddamn day

314
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,690
我退休以后
Yeah, when I retire,

315
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,794
我要搬到Esme，搬到galveston
I'm gonna move Esme and me down to galveston

316
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,662
买一艘渔船
Buy a fishing boat

317
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,198
就生活在码头上
Gonna live on that son of a bitch
right at the pier

318
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,000
谁知道呢？
Oh, who knows?

319
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,136
也许其中一个银行抢匪
Maybe one of these bank robbers

320
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,805
想要来一场枪战
is gonna want a gunfight,

321
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,809
我就能戴着荣誉勋章退休了
and I can dodge my retirement
in a Blaze of glory

322
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,844
我看过你开枪
Well, I've seen you shoot

323
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,546
肯定赢不了勋章
There won't be much glory in it

324
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,550
好吧，我运气好
Oh, well, I'm lucky

325
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,119
印第安兄弟们站在我一边，会帮我复仇的
I got a half-breed by my side to avenge me

326
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,590
如果你能保持足够长时间清醒的话
If you can stay sober long enough

327
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:22,226
知道你们印第安人多喜欢酒
Knowing how you injuns like the bottle

328
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,535
哇
Whoa

329
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,079
嗨，你究竟在干什么？
Hey What you all doing?

330
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,848
你在烧荒吗？
You burning this field?

331
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,149
究竟我们为什么要这么做？
Why in the shit would we do that?

332
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,650
这是高速公路引发的
This kicked up on the highway,

333
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,185
从那时起就一直困扰着我们
been chasing us ever since

334
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,154
希望我们能为你做些什么
Wish we could do something for you

335
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,255
应该就让它把我烧成灰
Ought to just let it turn me to ashes

336
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,623
让我不再悲催
and put me out of my misery

337
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,757
切断篱笆
Cut that fence

338
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,093
21世纪
21st century

339
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,596
我赶着牲口和火比赛看谁先到河边
I'm racing a fire to the river
with a herd of cattle

340
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:01,165
我希望我的孩子不用以此为生
And I wonder why my kids won't do
this shit for a living

341
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,100
继续走
Move it Come on

342
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,535
驾！！！
Go, go, go

343
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,907
你要报告吗？
You wanna call it in?

344
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,243
当它到了布拉索斯河就烧完了
Oh, it's gonna burn out when it hits the brazos

345
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,913
反正这附近也没有人住
No one to call around here, anyway

346
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,949
这些孩子都靠自己
These boys is on their own

347
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,860
我依然没有看到问题，Toby
I still don't see the problem, Toby

348
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:29,860
你依然没有……
You still don't

349
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:29,860
问题是，拜你所赐
Well, the problem is, thanks to you

350
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:34,131
我们需要再花一个早上才能找到另一辆车
we have to spend tomorrow morning getting another car

351
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,066
所以我们周三必须抢两家银行
so we'll have to hit two banks on Wednesday

352
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,968
我们今天已经做了三个了
We already done three today

353
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,603
别担心
Stop worrying

354
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:43,774
这是谁的土地？
Whose land is this?

355
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,680
Jeremy chalker

356
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,782
他让我待在这里，我帮他射土狼
He lets me stay here in exchange for
shooting coyotes

357
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,322
冰箱里有冰啤酒
Cold beer in the fridge

358
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:17,841
你偷了我的帽子
You stole my hat

359
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,643
我借的
I borrowed it

360
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:20,644
究竟你对它做了什么？
What the fuck you do to it?

361
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,827
这是什么？ 我的营生
What's this?  My livelihood

362
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,130
我们不需要这么多
We don't need all this

363
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,866
最后不能把枪留在拖车里
Can't keep the guns in the trailer days on end

364
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,201
不能带着这个去银行
That's not coming with us in the bank

365
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,974
刚刚和出纳谈过
Just spoke to the teller

366
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,308
她有点受惊了
She's a little shook up

367
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,710
Perp拿走了他的驾照
Perp took her driver's license,

368
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:53,877
威胁如果她报警，就会不利家人
threatened her family if she talked to us

369
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,650
我能知道你的名字吗？
Mind if I ask you your name, young lady?

370
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,752
Natalie Martinez

371
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:04,088
好吧，Natalie，我希望你知道
Well, Natalie,I want you to know

372
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,356
我们会派一些警官
we're gonna have some officers

373
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:07,257
保护你的家，非常的用心
watching your house,extra careful,

374
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,759
直到我们抓住这些抢匪
till we catch these buggers

375
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,928
我说话算话
You have my word on that

376
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,962
不止一个人吧？
There's more than one?

377
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,733
只有一个人抢银行？
Only one man robbed the bank?

378
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,801
是的 他什么样子？
YeahWhat'd he look like?

379
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,672
他穿的就像个牛仔，除了戴着滑雪面罩
He was dressed like a cowpoke except
for the ski mask

380
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,908
我觉得他跑进了一辆汽车
I think he ran to a car

381
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,244
就停在餐馆的前门
that was parked out front of the diner

382
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,245
你看到了汽车？
You saw the car?

383
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,348
绿色的
It was green

384
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,051
- 多老的汽车？ - 我不懂车，先生
How old? I don't know cars, mister

385
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:37,921
好吧，是一辆好车？还是一辆不错的车？
Well, was it a nice car or an okay car

386
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,089
或者就是一辆破车？
or a real piece of shit?

387
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,359
是一辆破车
It was a real piece of shit

388
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,263
好吧，我们还是得到了一些信息
All right Now, we're getting somewhere

389
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,899
好像另外一个人在里面接应
Oh, that looks like a man who could
foreclose on a house

390
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,367
打扰啦，Natalie
Excuse me, Natalie

391
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,236
打扰啦，Banker先生
Excuse me, Mr banker

392
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,038
Natalie，我会安排一个警官保护你
Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer stay with you

393
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,005
直到你父亲过来，好吧？
till your father arrives, all right?

394
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,807
好的
Okay

395
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:57,775
请问有没有今天早上的监控摄像？
Didn't happen to have
your surveillance cameras

396
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,209
请问有没有今天早上的监控摄像？
on this morning, did you?

397
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,444
当然有
Of course

398
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,346
所以你有劫匪的录像
Oh, so you have the robbery on video

399
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,747
当然有
Of course we do

400
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:04,948
我们这种银行当然有
What kind of bank would we be

401
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,784
能看一下监控吗？
if we didn't have video surveillance?

402
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:09,887
哦，你们一定是德州Midlands银行
Oh, you'd be a Texas Midlands bank

403
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,156
好吧，我们有录像了
All right, we've got video

404
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:14,958
仔细看看录像，我去劫匪接头的地方
Care to give it a watch while I wander over
to the burger joint?

405
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,126
你能帮我点些吃的吗？
Would you order me something

406
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,327
当你到那个餐馆的时候，我饿了
while you're there，I'm starving

407
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,730
我觉得他们不会有印第安干肉饼
I doubt they serve pemmican

408
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,799
你知道也也有墨西哥血统
You know I'm part Mexican, too

409
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,934
好吧，我知道了
Yeah, well, I'm gonna get to that

410
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,270
但是我喜欢印第安的段子
when I'm through with the Indian insults

411
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,705
还得有一阵子
but it's gonna be a while

412
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,710
你们骑警都够嘎的啊
You rangers are an odd bunch

413
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,880
就他那样我们看看视频吧
No, just himLet's take a look at that video

414
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,348
好的，在后面
Yeah, it's right back here

415
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,728
你好
Howdy

416
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,398
夫人，估计你也知道银行发生什么事情了吧
Ma'am Guess you know about the goings-on at the bank

417
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,833
注意到了
I did notice

418
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:59,403
今天有外面来的客人吗？
Any out-of-towners come through today?

419
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,506
Jenny Ann招待了一对小伙子，不是本地人
Jenny Ann waited on a couple of boys,ain't from here

420
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:03,941
哦？
Oh?

421
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:04,908
我去喊她
I'll go get her

422
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,844
非常感谢
Appreciate that

423
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:11,915
伙计们
Boys

424
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,085
你们一直在这里吗？
Y'all been here for a while?

425
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,254
是的，看到了整个抢劫的过程
Well, long enough to watch a bank getting robbed

426
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,290
那家银行已经抢了我30多年了
that's been robbing me for 30 years

427
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,391
你说你看到了他们？
Oh, you say you've seen them?

428
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,928
我很确定他们坐在那里
I'm pretty sure they were sitting

429
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,330
吃午餐
right over there having lunch

430
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,999
一个高一点
One of them was tall

431
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,235
一个矮一点
The other one was short

432
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,472
装束都像是牛仔
They's both lean like cowboys

433
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,142
看上去像是兄弟俩
Looked like brothers if you ask me

434
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,476
你是德州骑警？
You the Texas ranger?

435
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,513
是的，夫人
Yes, ma'am

436
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:45,482
讲讲你招待的那些英俊的年轻陌生人
Tell me about those handsome young strangers
that you waited on

437
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,418
谁说他们英俊了？
Who said handsome?

438
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,355
我说的
I did

439
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,124
根据你没有冲到停车场
Based on the fact that you didn't meet me
in the parking lot

440
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,859
向我大声叫喊有两个外地人
hollering about the two out-of-towners

441
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,961
抢银行之前在这里吃饭
eating here right before a bank robbery

442
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,533
他们没有提及要抢银行
Well, they didn't mention they was robbing the bank

443
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:03,467
付得现金？
They pay cash?

444
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,503
那也犯法吗？
That a crime now?

445
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,074
他们留下多少钱？
How much did they leave?

446
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,512
多少钱？
How much?

447
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,982
200美元
$200

448
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:22,586
那是他们抢银行之前留下的，所以……
And they left it before the bank was robbed So

449
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,922
抢银行之前
Uh, before this bank was robbed

450
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,192
我需要看看那些钱
I'm gonna need to see them bills

451
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,264
夫人
Ma'am  Mmm-mmm

452
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,368
那些钱是证据
Ma'am, them bills is evidence

453
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,004
如果它们是银行劫匪的就是证据
Mmm-mmm It's evidence if they're the bank robbers

454
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,906
目前为止，它是我的小费
Till then, it's my tip

455
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,510
我一半的房贷
And half my mortgage

456
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,413
所以，你去拿搜查证，再要钱
So, you go out there and you get a warrant
and come after the money

457
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,582
这钱能保证我女儿不会睡大街
that I will be using to keep a roof
over my daughter's head

458
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,957
一个人抢了银行，的确如她所说
One man hit the bank, just like she said

459
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,525
花格子衬衫

461
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,497
花格子衬衫，就是他

462
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:13,070
他们就坐在那里，给了200元的小费
They were sitting right over there
Tipped her $200

463
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:18,308
去厨房和那个蛮横大胖妞印证一下
Go wrestle a description from that big sassy girl
in the kitchen

464
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,308
你怎么自己不去？
You didn't get it yourself?

465
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,312
哦，拿到那些小费，我们需要检查那些钞票
Oh, and get that tip from her
We're gonna check them bills

466
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,948
祝你好运
Good luck

467
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,550
我希望会顺利
Yeah, I'd expect some resistance

468
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,053
另外，Alberto

470
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,926
我们要在这里过夜？
We're gonna stay the night?

471
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,227
嗯，这就是案发地
Well, this is where the action is

472
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,564
看着挺蠢的
Seems foolish

473
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,366
什么？
What's that?

474
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,567
大白天的抢银行
The days of robbing banks

475
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,535
努力活下去
and trying to live,spend the money

476

他们早就跑远了
They've long gone

477
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,108
肯定跑远了
Long gone for sure

478
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,551
Justin长大了想做什么？
What does Justin want to do when he's grown?

479
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,657
目前为止梦想打橄榄球
Right now he's dreaming
of slinging a football for a&m

他很像你
He's a lot like you

481
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:16,366
I bet that puckers your red eye

这次你没有忘了枪！

吃一堑长一智啊
You're getting to be old hat at this

502
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,668
混蛋可能会杀了你

Just let me touch you

559
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,667
你想要钓我的小兄弟吗？
Are you trying to work my little brother?

560
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:04,667
不，我没有干什么……
No, I wasn't doing anything, but I'm

561
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:04,667
Tanner，她没有做什么
Tanner, she didn't do nothin'

562
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:08,671
她没有做什么，但是，但是……
She didn't do nothin'
But, but, but, but, but

563
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,507
你看到那里有一堆筹码
You saw there was a stack of chips, here

564
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,641
容易钱？ 不是
Easy mark? Don't

565
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,443
哦……不
Uh no

566
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,611
你要怎么做？带他到他的房间
What were you gonna do?
Bring him up to his room,

567
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:15,745
叫来你的皮条客
call your pimp,

568
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:15,745
勒索他？
roll him, drug him, what?
No I

569
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,915
- 你要干什么？ - Tanner，不要
What were you gonna do?
Tanner, don't

570
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,917
介意我试试货吗？
Mind if I sample the goods?
Real

571
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,788
放开她，住手
Hands off her
Stop it Stop it

572
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,661
你个疯子
You're fucking crazy

573
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,796
电话给我啊
Call me

574
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,664
我这里有情况……
We got a problem here……

575
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:34,664
没事了
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good

576
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,467
没事了，喝多了
It's all good
Just got a little drunk

577
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,468
在吧台，抱歉抱歉
at the bar,
sorry about that

578
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,440
究竟你是怎么
How the fuck have you managed

579
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:44,574
在监狱外面待了一年的
to stay out of prison for a year?

580
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:46,643
很难
It's been difficult

581
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,950
希望用现金还是支票？
Like to pay this out in cash or check?

582
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,452
给Debbie带些钱
Get some Debbie money

583
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,855
四成现金，其余的支票
Four in cash,
rest in check

584
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,091
你希望在哪里支取？
Who would you like the check made out to?

585
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,695
德州Midlands银行
Texas Midlands bank

586
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,205
非常感谢
Thank you much

587
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,608
我们订个房间
Let's go get a room

588
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,121
欢迎来到卡曼奇66旅店，请问有没有预订
Welcome to the comanche 66
Do you have a reservation?

589
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,156
没有预订
We do not

590
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,761
神啊，看看你
Good lord, look at you

591
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:41,097
若能提供房间，我辈感恩备至
We would be obliged if you
would provide accommodations

592
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,700
冒昧未能提前预约
though we failed to call ahead

593
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,602
伙计，你摊上事儿了
Boy, you are trouble

594
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,003
哦，最坏的那种，亲爱的
Oh, the worst kind, darling

595
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,172
在你的弥留之际
In your last days in the nursing home,

596
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,608
你将能想起我和我的笑声
you'll think of me and giggle

597
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,548
为什么，上帝
<i> Why, god,</i>

598
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,782
为什么你，没有回应我的祷告
<i> why won't you</i>
<i> answer my prayers?</i>

599
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,050
你祈求他的帮助
<i> You begged him for help,</i>

600
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,619
然而回顾你的一生
<i> and yet you look</i>
<i> around at your life</i>

601
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,153
没有什么不同
<i> and nothing is different</i>

602
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:07,056
所以你假设上帝对你说不
<i> And so you assume</i>
<i> that god has told you no</i>

603
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,294
上帝没有说不
<i> God doesn't say no</i>

604
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,696
为什么我们不回Lubbock市？
Why couldn't we drive back to lubbock?

605
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,866
他们不会抢劫Lubbock的银行
They ain't robbing banks in lubbock

606
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,568
为什么我们非要看这个节目？
We're not gonna watch this, are we?

607
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:21,838
难道你不是基督徒？
Ain't you Christian?

608
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,240
是，但我不是傻瓜
Yeah But I ain't stupid

609
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,875
上帝才不会通过这个人说话
God doesn't talk through this man

610
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,844
宁可通过我的狗
any more than he talks through my dog

611
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,612
好吧，你应该给你的狗受洗
Well, then maybe you should give
your dog a listen

612
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,781
你不是印第安人？
Ain't you Indian?

613
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:35,018
你应该是被火烧的圣人
You're supposed to be burning Sage

614
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,787
绕着床起舞，像一群嗡嗡的蜜蜂
and dancing around the bed
whooping like a bee stung you

615
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,756
我是天主教徒
I'm catholic

616
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,326
你可拉倒吧
Come on

617
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,666
少来，我宁可拿着长矛围着火堆跳舞
Come on! I'd rather dance around a fire with a spear

618
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,635
我宁可你用长矛扎我，也不想要看这个
I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this

619
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,704
这个狗娘养的，根本不懂上帝
This son of a bitch, he wouldn't know god

620
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,774
（总之是骂人的话）
if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker

621
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:58,942
赶紧的换台！
Change the damn channel

622
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:09,686
看这个，就看这个
Now, this, this is what god watches right here

623
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,026
不用担心，他们很快就播足球集锦
Don't worry, they're gonna have soccer highlights
on soon enough

624
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,928
很适合你的那一半墨西哥血统
That's for your Mexican half

625
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,366
哦！
Ooh!

626
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,370
哇，看这孩子跑的多快
Wow, look at this boy run

627
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:29,372
Longhorns今年的阵容不错
Longhorns are gonna have a good team this year

628
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:37,180
足球，永远不能理解那个
That soccer,never could understand that

629
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:40,283
任何5岁孩子都能玩的，才不是运动
Anything a five-year-old can do ain't a sport

630
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:44,053
谁发明的？阿兹特克人（印第安人的一支，也被称墨西哥人）
Who invented it? Aztecs?

631
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:46,222
先是踢头骨之类的是吗？
Kickin' around skulls or something, right?

632
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,859
听着像是卡曼奇人的运动
Sounds like a comanche sport

633
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,396
你知道，在三个星期里
You know, in three weeks,

634
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:56,833
你可以看任何你想要看的电视
you can watch whatever you want on TV all day

635
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:59,402
只要你在自己的房间里
Hell, you can do it right now in your own room

636
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,371
那样就没劲了
Oh, where's the fun in that?

637
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,374
你知道吗，Alberto
You know what, Alberto?

638
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,342
什么？
What?

639
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,379
一年的时间
In a year's time

640
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,282
你肯定会想念我的调侃的
it's my teasing that you're gonna miss

641
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,719
那将是你所有的笑点
It's what you'll laugh about

642
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,421
当你站在我的坟墓前祝福我的时候
when you stand over my grave and wish me well

643
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,391
上帝，我希望那是明天
God, I hope that's tomorrow

644
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,793
那真有你的
Oh, that was a good one

645
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,364
你会明白这个的
You'll get the hang of this yet

646
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,773
现在给你不迟吧？
Isn't it getting late for you?

647
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:42,779
是的
Yeah

648
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,718
是的
Yeah, it is

649
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,939
苍天在上
Oh, heavens above Heavens above

650
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:12,041
看看那些头衔，你是在开玩笑吗？
Look at those titties Are you fucking kidding me?

651
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,054
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

652
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,460
睡在走廊上，预演我的未来
Sleeping on the porch, practicing my future

653
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:12,468
我们谋生的方式是很危险的
It's a dangerous thing we do for a living

654
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:14,170
你很幸运
You're lucky,

655
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,541
走到了终点
having seen it through to the end

656
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,310
我希望我幸运
I hope I'm that lucky

657
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,014
好的
Oh, well

658
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,884
没有我在你身边
Without me by your side

659
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:29,318
我怀疑你根本无法距离罪犯太近
I doubt you'd get close enough

660
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,521
总在危险之外
to a criminal to ever be in danger again

661
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,561
刚刚我还对你有些歉疚呢
Just when I was starting to feel sorry for you

662
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,900
印第安人不应该对牛仔有歉疚
Indians ain't supposed to feel sorry for cowboys

663
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:45,168
不是一回事
It's the other way around

664
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,545
这让你成为遗嘱执行人？
And this makes you the executor?

665
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:57,580

Mmm-hmm

666
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:58,815
无论他们控告我们什么
No matter what they charge us with,

667
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:00,583
他们都不能拿走
they can't take it away

668
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,252
无法追踪赌场的资金
There's no way to trace funds from a casino

669
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:04,987
对吗？一旦你把支票给银行
All right? Once you get the checks to the bank

670
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,989
信托是安全的
trust is untouchable

671
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,560
你不能对别人透露什么，对吗？
You can't tell nobody nothing, right?

672
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:12,228
是啊，我要说什么？
Well, what is there to tell?

673
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,964
我的意思是说，你们是从赌场赢的钱，不是吗？
I mean, you boys won that money
gambling, didn't you?

674
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:21,137
32000元用于抵押贷款
$32,000 pays off the reverse mortgage

675
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:24,340
那些混蛋支付了从2012年到现在的房产税
And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now

676
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,609
那是12000元
that's another $11,000

677
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:31,047
所以，43000元你们就自由了，结清了
So, $43,000 and you are free and clear

678
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:34,617
只要贷款官员传真给我解除抵押的文件
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien

679
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,220
我会交给Chevron的租赁经理
and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at chevron

680
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:38,154
税号在卡上
The fax number is on the card

681
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:39,589
好的
Okay

682
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:41,123
这笔交易你能赚多少？
How much you making on this deal?

683
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,961
同风险相比没有几个钱
Not near as much as I'm risking

684
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:45,962
那你为什么做？
Why you doin' it then?

685
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,403
你知道，他们提供尽量少的贷款
You know, they loaned the least they could

686
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,506
仅仅够你妈妈基本归还额
Just enough to keep your mama
poor on a guaranteed return

687
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:03,479
本来打算从她的土地上再捞25000元的
Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000

688
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,948
如此的傲慢，让人恨得牙疼
That's just so arrogant, it makes my teeth hurt

689
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,487
看看你们
To see you boys

690
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,589
用那些混蛋们自己的钱还给他们自己
pay those bastards back with their own money?

691
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:18,561
如果那不是德州人，我不知道什么才是
Well, if that ain't texan,I don't know what is

692
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,601
谢 谢 你
Thank you

693
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,536
另外，他们周五会提前关门
Now, they can foreclose on Friday

694
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,105
无论如何

695
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:30,606
周四到childress市的银行

696
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,008
知道他们操蛋，他们会早关门
Knowing them fuckers, they will close early

697
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:35,111

We'll be there，Oh, and, Toby

698
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:37,313
信托需要被一家银行管理
the trust needs to be managed by a bank

699
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:40,416
如果你真的要隐藏痕迹的话
You really wanna cover your tracks?

700
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,652
你需要让德州Midlands银行托管
You get Texas midland to handle this trust

701
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,538
所以
So,

702
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,374
什么计划？
what's the plan?

703
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:08,644
我们要密切关注那银行
We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder

704
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,180
及时，我们会没事的
In time, we'll be right

705
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:15,184
现在，让我们看看这里有什么吃的
Now, let's see what they got to eat here

706
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:17,320
你好，夫人，今天怎么样？
Howdy, ma'am
How are you doing today?

707
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:19,722
很热，我心情不好
Hot And I don't mean the good kind

708
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,525
所以，你们不要什么？
So, what don't you want?

709
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,694
再说一次？
Pardon?

710
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:26,395
你不想要什么？
What don't you want?

711
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:31,667
哦，好的 我觉得我要……
Oh, well, uh,
i think I'll just, uh

712
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:35,037
我在这里工作了44年了
You know, I've been working here for 44 years

713
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,406
从来没有遇到过
Ain't nobody ever ordered nothing

714
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:40,076
乱点T排骨和烤土豆以外的菜
but t-bone steak and a baked potato

715
00:49:40,078 --> 00:49:42,745
除了一个从纽约来的混球
Except this one asshole from New York

716
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:46,215
在1987年的时候竟然想要点鲑鱼
tried to order trout back in 1987

717
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,351
我们从来不卖什么鸟鲑鱼
We don't sell no goddamned trout

718
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,288
T骨牛排
T-bone steaks

719
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:56,092
所以，你也不要配玉米棒子
So, either you don't want the corn on the cob,

720
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,494
你也不要绿豆子
or you don't want the green beans

721
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,762
所以，你有什么不要的？
So, what don't you want?

722
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,735
我不要绿豆子
I don't want green beans

723
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:08,004
我也不要绿豆子
I don't want green beans either

724
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,272
牛排三分熟
Steaks cooked medium rare

725
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,641
我的牛排是否……没有问题
Can I get my steak cooked That weren't no question

726
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,543
好吧
All right

727
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,680
冰茶要吗
Iced tea for you boys

728
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:18,781
冰茶当然很棒啊
Iced tea would be great

729
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,518
也是冰茶，谢谢你，夫人

730
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,452
哦

731
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,724
好，我告诉你一件事
Well, I'll tell you one thing

732
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,228
才不会有人想要抢这里
Nobody's gonna rob this son of a bitch

733
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:34,697
听我一句
My word

734
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:44,673
她怎么样？
How's she feel?

735
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,810
她跑的很好
She runs good

736
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:49,078
有没有赢过什么比赛？
Ain't gonna win any races

737
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,480
得过墨西哥的奖牌
Got new Mexico plates

738
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,717
冠军？
She got a top?

739
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:55,684
那就是她的来历
That's how she came

740
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,188
我们要她了
We'll take her

741
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,592
周五前别报警他被偷了
Don't report it stolen until Friday

742
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,102
从Chevron来的家伙放弃了租约
The guy from chevron is dropping off
the lease agreement

743
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,204
你能自己处理吗？
Are you okay dealing with that by yourself?

744
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:16,605
你自己能和Debbie好好待着吗？
You okay being with Debbie by yourself?

745
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,309
记住，他不是敌人

746
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,710
就接过文件，说谢谢
Just take the papers, and say thank you

747
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,313
石油工人是敌人
The oil man is the enemy,

748
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,182
没有犯错他只是不是我们一伙的
make no mistake，He just ain't ours

749
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:29,718
我天黑的时候会回牧场
I'll be back to the ranch by dark

750
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,654
我会一直等着
I will be waiting

751
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,355
开车开得像学校老师一样，因为后备箱里的那些玩意儿
Drive like a schoolteacher with all
this shit in the back

752
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,662
好像到了啤酒时间了
Sure feels like beer o'clock

753
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,566
请求并希望能接受
Ask and you shall receive

754
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,263
进来
Come in

755
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,242
妈妈死了
Mama died

756
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:27,877
什么时候？
When?

757
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,745
几周之前
A few weeks ago

758
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,781
总算解脱了
Well, good riddance

759
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,251
没有别的意思
No offense

760
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,888
你还好吗？
You okay?

761
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:41,624
你呢？
You?

762
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:46,862
这些钱，是我欠你的
Here's the money i owe you

763
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,867
我猜你将会卖掉牧场
I guess you'll be selling the ranch

764
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,537
已经转给儿子了
It goes to the boys

765
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:55,671
真的？ 嗯
Really? Mmm

766
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,540
已经放在了一个信托里了
It's been put in a trust

767
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:58,741
什么意思？
What's that mean?

768
00:52:58,743 --> 00:52:59,842
意味着没有人能卖掉它
It means no one can sell it

769
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,281
太好了，我又多了可以操心的事情了
Great Something else i got to take care of

770
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,295
嗨
Hi

771
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:57,933
你兄弟在哪里？
Where's your brother?

772
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:01,270
我不知道
I don't know

773
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:03,439
朋友家吧，我猜
Friend's house,i guess

774
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,513
你怎么没有去学习？
How come you ain't in school?

775
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,750
还没有开学
School don't start yet

776
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,019
现在一天两次足球课
Just two-a-days for football right now

777
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,994
你奶奶死了
Your grandmother died

778
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,698
我把牧场留给了你和你兄弟
I'm giving the ranch to you and your brother

779
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,569
你小的时候去过那里还记得吗？
Remember going out there
when you was little?

780
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,539
我该拿一个农场怎么办？
What am I supposed to do with a ranch?

781
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,009
除了卖掉之外干什么都行
Anything but sell it

782
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,046
我们在那里发现了油
We found oil on it

783
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,485
你和你兄弟不用再担心钱的问题了
You and your brother ain't gonna have to worry
about money no more

784
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,322
现在
Now

785
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,760
你可能听说很多我的事情
you may be hearing a lot of things about me

786
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,029
还有你伯伯的
and your uncle

787
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,700
不要像我们一样
Don't be like us

788
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:04,700
你听到我的话了？
You hear me?

789
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,738
不管我听到什么我都不会相信的
Whatever I hear, i won't believe

790
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,839
不，你只要相信一点
No, you believe it

791
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,709
我做的所有的事情
I did all of it

792
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:17,946
现在你要做一些不同的事情
Now, you, you do it different

793
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,958
不喝酒？
Ain't gonna drink it?

794
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,830
你让我不要想你一样
You tell me not to be like you,

795
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,931
但是却让我喝啤酒？
and then you offer me a beer

796
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,800
哪句是真的？
Which is it?

797
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:41,937
好孩子
Good boy

798
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,560
孩子们怎么样？你在干什么？
How are the boys? What are you doin'?

799
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,629
保险
Insurance

800
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,598
我不要那个东西
I don't want that shit in the car

801
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,767
下次我们要开两辆车
We'll be running two cars next time, brother

802
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:13,602
我会带着它们
They'll ride with me

803
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,977
这就是你的计划？
So, this is your plan?

804
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:23,679
我们就是坐在这里
We're just gonna sit here

805
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,048
看这家银行是否是他们的下一个目标
and see if this is the branch they rob next

806
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,516
那你想要做什么？
What would you rather do?

807
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:29,151
你想要开车80英里回Olney
You wanna drive 80 miles back to olney

808
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:32,054
试图找到我们没有找到过的指纹？
and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?

809
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,857
或者开车200英里回到Lubbock
Or you wanna drive 200 miles back to lubbock

810
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,725
看看那些根本不重要的枪击
and look at mug shots that don't matter

811
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,827
因为没有人知道这些龟儿子长什么样子
because nobody knows
what these sons of bitches look like

812
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,830
或者我们干脆坐在这里等他们抢劫这家银行
Or we can just wait here for them to rob this bank,

813
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:44,600
这是唯一的我他妈的能确定他们会做的事情
which is the one thing
I'm pretty damn sure they are going to do

814
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:47,569
我知道你在干什么
I know what you're doing

815
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,639
你试图尽量让这次任务延长
You're trying to make this last as long as you can
because the longer it lasts

816
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,508
它持续的越长距离前门廊就越远（也是不想退休）
the farther you are from that front porch

817
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,110
不，我在等这些孩子犯错
No, I'm waitin' for these boys to make a mistake

818
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,779
目前为止他们还没有，但是他们会的
So far they ain't, but they will

819
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:58,013
他们会在这里犯错的
And they're gonna make it here

820
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,849
所以，放松一些
So, just relax

821
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,952
享受一下这个小镇子
Enjoy this little town

822
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:06,054
你想要住在这里吗？
Do you wanna live here?

823
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:09,725
只有一个老商店
Got an old hardware store
that charges twice what home depot does

824
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:13,829
一个家有着蛇鼠做窝的餐馆和一个老招待
one restaurant with a rattlesnake for a waitress

825
00:57:13,831 --> 00:57:16,832
我的意思是怎么会有人愿意在这里生活？
I mean, how is anybody supposed to make
a living here?

826
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,468
人们已经在这里生活了150年了
People have made a living here for 150 years

827
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,137
好吧，人类已经在洞穴里生活了15万年了
Well, people lived in caves for 150,000 years

828
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:23,705
但是他们不想再那么生活了
But they don't do it no more

829
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:25,507
当然，也许你的人民不那么想
Well, maybe your people did

830
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,912
你的人民也是一样
Your people did, too

831
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:32,514
很久以前，你的祖先是印第安人
A long time ago, your ancestors was the Indians,

832
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,718
直到有人来杀了他们
till someone came along and killed them,

833
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,688
打倒了他们，使得你成为了他们的一员
broke 'em down, made you into one of them

834
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:46,028
150年前，所有的这些都是我的祖先的土地
150 years ago, all of this was my ancestors' land

835
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,231
你能看到的所有的一切
Everything you could see

836
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,134
昨天你能看到的所有一切
Everything you saw yesterday

837
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,071
直到这些家伙们的父辈们掠夺了它
Till the grandparents of these folks took it

838
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,242
而现在，它被从他们手里夺走了
And now, it's been taken from them

839
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,579
只是不再用军队了
Except it ain't no army doing it

840
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,049
而是那边那些龟儿子
It's those sons of bitches right there

841
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,594
你想过明天吗？
You thinking about tomorrow?

842
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,097
你没有吗？
Ain't you?

843
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,967
那个小旅馆店员
That little hotel clerk

844
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,837
为什么甜美的天使
Why is it always the sweet ones

845
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,173
一翻脸就成了可怕恶魔
that are such devils when you get them revved up?

846
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,143
不知道，还从来没有遇见过甜美的天使
Wouldn't know, never had a sweet one

847
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:38,547
是啊 你喜欢惹毛他们
Yeah, you like them pissed off

848
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:39,915
总是故意找碴
lookin' for someone to blame

849
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,218
还真的是那样
Sure seems that way

850
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,099
你正在做的是好事
It's a good thing you're doing

851
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,236
我们一起做的
We're doing it

852
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,687
明天对银行出纳别太凶
Go easy on the bank teller tomorrow

853
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,291
我会像年轻护士一样的温柔
I'll be as gentle as a young nurse

854
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,023
你来吗？
You coming?

855
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,359
按照我的方式
On my way

856
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:15,437
嗨
Hey

857
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:17,773
妈的
Shit

858
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,045
早上好
Good morning

859
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:26,915
你要吃早餐吗？
You want some breakfast?

860
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:28,950
是的，来份早餐不错
Yeah,breakfast sounds good

861
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,792
所以我们先到Jayton分行，然后Colman分行，对吗？
So we hit the jayton branch first, then Coleman, right?

862
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,126
那样应该就能凑够数了
Yeah, that should get us what we need

863
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:34,850
让我们做这个吧
Let's do this

864
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,157
妈的
Ugh shit

865
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,492
那他妈的不是计划的一部分
That's not part of the fucking plan

866
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:44,893
混蛋们关掉了分行
Bastards closed down the branch

867
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,396
怎么办，老弟？
What now, little brother?

868
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,466
Coleman

869
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,803
你究竟在做什么？
What the hell you doing?

870
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:28,904
我们应该去Post
We gotta head to post

871
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:30,238
你究竟在干什么？
What the hell you doing? Get

872
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,281
我们应该去Post，你到底在说什么？
We got to head to post What are you talking about?

873
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:40,448
我们应该去Post
We got to head to post

874
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,884
我们将要去Colman
We're going to Coleman

875
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,186
在Coleman只有一个出纳
There's only one teller in Coleman

876
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:45,453
无论如何我们都无法得到足够的钱
Whatever we get won't be enough

877
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,557
我们应该去Coleman
We go to Coleman right now

878
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:48,557
如果还是不够，我们再去Post
If that ain't enough,we head to post

879
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,992
如果我们现在不去Post
If we don't leave now for Post

880
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,327
那么我们到中午才能到那里
we won't get there till noon

881
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,263
你不会在午餐的时候抢银行吧？
You don't wanna rob a bank at lunchtime, do you?

882
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:56,832
是的，我们还不了解那里的人的活动规律
Yeah, we don't know the patterns of folks out there

883
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:58,533
各地的规律都是一样的
The patterns are the same everywhere

884
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:00,602
所有这些镇子都死气沉沉，Post也不例外
All these towns are dead Post ain't no different

885
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:02,938
那是一家更大的银行
It's a bigger bank

886
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,141
我们将把你的车放在城外
We'll leave your car just out of town

887
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,275
现在过来
Come on now

888
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,411
妈的
Shit

889
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,422
我觉得我明白了
I think I got this figured

890
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:25,894
前两家银行，都是德州Midlands银行
First two banks, they were Texas midland banks

891
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:27,929
好吧，总共有7家分行
All right, there are seven branches altogether

892
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:30,332
总行在fort worth
The main branch is in fort worth

893
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:33,301
他们不会去那里捣乱的
They're not gonna mess with that

894
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:36,905
对吧？ 他们抢了Olney分行
All right? They hit the branch in olney

895
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:38,440
他们抢劫了Archer分行
They hit the one in Archer city

896
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,942
这里还有一家
Then there's the one here

897
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,244
他们还没有抢劫过的
Which they did not hit

898
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:47,916
Alberto，你愿意跟着我吗？
Alberto, will you please follow me?

899
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,586
只要你不说话就行
Just keep your mouth shut

900
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,555
只要听我说就行了
and just listen to what I'm gonna say

901
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:56,391
这里有一家
There's the one here

902
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,226
Childress有一家
then there's the one in childress

903
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,995
Jayton有一家
There's the one in jayton

904
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,496
那家关门了
That one's closed

905
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,098
我知道那家关门了
I know that one's closed!

906
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:08,470
我知道那家关门了，Alberto
I know that one's closed, Alberto

907
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,910
我就是那个意思Jayton关门了
That's my point Jayton is closed

908
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,379
那么就剩下Post分行了
That just leaves post

909
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,147
他们不会去Childress那里捣乱的
They're not gonna mess with the bank in childress

910
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,615
那是一个非常衰败的城镇
that's a fairly decent-sized town

911
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,387
Vernon分行不是Midlands的，但是他们却抢劫了那里
The branch in Vernon wasn't Midlands
and they hit that

912
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:28,123
是的，一个人单干的
Yeah, one of them did Alone

913
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:31,159
然后他跑到街对面钻进了汽车里
Then he ran all the way across the road
to get to the car

914
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:33,395
我觉得他的搭档不知道他要抢银行
I think his partner had no idea that was gonna happen

915
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:35,397
那对我们来说意味着什么？
And what does that mean to us?

916
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:38,400
那意味着Post分行是他们唯一要去的地方
It means that the only branch that fits the bill is in post

917
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:39,301
好吧，我们走
Well, then let's go

918
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,030
镇子看起来很繁忙
The town looks busy

919
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,967
有点
Little bit

920
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,609
要我说
My word

921
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,989
太大了
It's too big

922
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:35,156
她是这么说过
That's what she said

923
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,662
不太好
It's no good

924
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:42,330
这不是第一遭
Aw, this ain't your first rodeo

925
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,067
更大的银行
Bigger bank

926
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:49,304
更多钱
More money

927
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,359
所有人，都他妈的趴在地上
Everybody, get on the fucking ground!

928
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,328
他妈的趴在地上

929
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:16,531
年轻女士，他妈的趴在地上，立刻！

930
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,802
先生，趴下！在地上！立刻！
Sir, down! On the ground! Now!

931
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:22,404
非常感谢
Thank you very much

932
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,409
出纳起立！
Tellers stand up!

933
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,812
打开抽屉
Open the drawers!

934
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,051
离开！
Get down!

935
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,254
后退三步！
Take three steps back!

936
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:41,623
打开他妈的抽屉，女士！
Open the fucking drawer,young lady!

937
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,425
你是聋子还是傻子？
Are you deaf and dumb?

938
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:45,560
我说过了打开他妈的的抽屉
I said open the motherfucking drawer!

939
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,795
你，趴下！
You, down!

940
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,264
现在，退后！
Now, step back!

941
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,568
很好，注意了
Very good Someone's paying attention

942
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,740
现在，跪下！
Now, get on your motherfucking knees!

943
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,642
嗨！

趴下！
Stay down!

945
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,720
好吧
All right

946
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:48,523
嗨！嗨！我们走吧！
Hey, hey, let's go!

947

911报警
Call 911

948
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:52,861

949
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,364
整个他妈的的镇子都在射我们
The whole goddamn town is shooting at us

950
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,767

953
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,890
后面怎么样？小兄弟？
How you doing back there, little brother?

954
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:24,259
你杀了他们
You fucking killed them

955
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:27,495
这些带枪的把银行抢劫复杂化了，不是吗？
Those concealed carry permits sure complicate
a bank robbery, don't they?

956
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:28,796
不是我的错，今天是发薪日
It's not my fault it was payday

957
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,603
这次太过了，Tan
This has gone too far, tan

958
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:37,639
没有人应该死
No one was supposed to fucking die

959
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,208
不是他们就是我们，由你选
It was them or us, take your pick

960
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,624
好的，Margaret
Yeah, go, Margaret

961
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,793
德州Midlands Post分行被抢了
Texas Midlands in post has just been hit

962
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:01,462
啊！我告诉过你什么？
Ah! What did I tell you?

963
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:02,664
是的
Yeah

964
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,799
本地人都在追呢
Yeah Locals are in chase

965
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:08,403
疑犯开着野马向西逃了
Suspects escaping west in an old bronco

966
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:09,637
好吧，Margaret，有消息告诉我们
All right, Margaret, keep us posted

967
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,206
我们正在向那里去
We're on our way there

968
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,208
给我一个印第安人呜，来吧
Give me an Indian whoop Come on

969
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,412
这些家伙跑不了了
These boys gonna go down

970
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:19,747
让我们来点带劲的音乐

也许在镇上就抓住一个
Maybe the town folks got one

1021
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,712
如果他们真抓住一个，那么就是那个聪明的一个了

你能带我绕到他背后吗？

所以出来学着抢银行，但是没有那么走运了
Been trying to track him down,
but no luck so far

1111
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,817
你们调查过他的兄弟们了？
You all are off the brother?

1112
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:39,886
没有证据能联系到他兄弟
There's nothing that links him
to the robberies

1113
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:42,489
Vernon的女招待的证词呢？
And what about that little waitress in Vernon?

1114
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:45,592
我们给她看过照片，她没有认出来他
Yeah, we showed her photos,and she said she
didn't recognize him

1115
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,261
非常恼怒你拿走了她的消费当证据
Pretty upset you took her tips as evidence

1116
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:51,031
她是很蛮横
She sure was sassy

1117
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,966
你给她看的四那张老照片？
You show that to that old timer?

1118
01:27:52,968 --> 01:27:55,836
她说看起来不想用餐的那个家伙
Yup She said he didn't look like
the fella from the diner

1119
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:58,305
她也没有认出tanner的照片
She didn't recognize Tanner's photo either

1120
01:27:58,307 --> 01:27:59,906
还申请法庭命令
Yeah Tried to get a court order

1121
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:01,608
调查他的账户和农场
on his bank accounts and the ranch,

1122
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,477
检察官不愿意那么做Toby没有犯罪记录
DA wouldn't do it Toby's got no record

1123
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:05,512
从来没有被逮捕过
He's never been arrested

1124
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:07,547
唯一的出庭记录是离婚
His only court appearance was at his divorce

1125
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:09,750
他不符合要求，Marcus
He don't fit the bill, Marcus

1126
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:11,551
人们不相信他会抢银行
People don't start out robbing banks

1127
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:13,820
都认为是他的混蛋哥哥干的
They graduate to it like his asshole brother

1128
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:15,589
此外，我们到那里的时候
Besides, when we was out there

1129
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:17,391
我们看到两组Chevron来的人
we saw two crews from chevron

1130
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:19,593
正在安装钻井架
capping Wells and putting in pumpjacks

1131
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:21,495
工程师说他们那里有石油
Engineers out there said they're gonna pull

1132
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:23,664
每个月至少2000桶
2,000 barrels a month off that place

1133
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:25,399
你需要说服法官
You just try convincing a judge

1134
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:27,034
给一个月收入5万元的家伙开搜查证
to issue warrants on somebody

1135
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:29,836
罪名是从银行了抢了4万元
set to clear $50,000 a month for robbing
$40,000 from the bank

1136
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:31,738
而且那家银行还管理着他们家的信托
that manages the family trust

1137
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,407
Midland管理信托？
Midland manages the trust?

1138
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:39,413
你觉得他们想要案情水落石出
You'd think they'd want this thing figured out

1139
01:28:39,415 --> 01:28:41,481
我不认为银行还关心这个
I don't think the bank cares about anything

1140
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:44,017
他们更关心能否留住那个信托
but keeping that trust right where it is

1141
01:28:44,019 --> 01:28:46,086
他们主要通过Toby的律师合作
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney

1142
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:51,792
Marcus，他不是嫌疑犯，你也该退休了
Marcus, he's not a suspect and you are retired

1143
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:53,994
哦，我听到你了
Oh, I hear you

1144
01:28:58,366 --> 01:28:59,599
你喜欢这桌子？
You like the desk?

1145
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:02,069
我不恨它
I don't hate it

1146
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,073
嗨， 我将会去看你的，Marcus
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus

1147
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:44,571
知道我是谁吗？
Know who I am?

1148
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:50,744
我是杀死你哥哥的人
I'm the man who killed your brother

1149
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:52,512
我知道
I know

1150
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,616
我还知道你退休了而且你侵犯了私人领地
I also know you're retired and you're trespassing

1151
01:30:58,219 --> 01:30:59,586
你现在可以射我
Oh, you could shoot me now

1152
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:01,922
那是你的权力
and be within your rights

1153
01:31:01,924 --> 01:31:04,691
你拿着枪，非常方便
You toting a gun and all,
how convenient

1154
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:07,561
我觉得你肯定也带着枪
I figure you got one, too

1155
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:14,901
我能坐坐吗？
Mind if I sit?

1156
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:20,574
来吧
Go ahead

1157
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,232
要啤酒吗？
You want a beer?

1158
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:49,569
当然，我现在不当差了
Sure I ain't on duty no more

1159
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,181
谢谢
Thanks

1160
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:09,122
出来透透气很好
It's nice out here in this breeze, though,

1161
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:10,824
现在凉快下来了
now that it's cooled down

1162
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:22,669
你怎么做到的？
How did you do it?

1163
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,608
别介意，我会想明白的
Oh, never mindI'll figure that out in time

1164
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:32,779
为什么？为什么你要做那个？
Why? Why did you do it?

1165
01:32:32,781 --> 01:32:35,181
我知道你哥哥Tanner为什么那么做
I know why your brother,Tanner, did it

1166
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:37,951
他抢银行因为他喜欢那么做
He robbed them banks because he liked it

1167
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:42,956
他300码外射中了我的搭档
He shot my partner 300 yards away

1168
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,891
因为他喜欢，那让他感觉不错
because he liked it,it made him feel good

1169
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,996
如果我没有轰出来他的脑浆
If I hadn't blown his shit for brains out,

1170
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:53,700
估计前面会停着一辆新卡车
there'd be a new truck out front with jet skis,

1171
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:55,702
不然他还会买什么
and whatever else he could think to buy

1172
01:32:55,704 --> 01:32:57,003
他会花光所有的钱
He'd spend it all just to give him

1173
01:32:57,005 --> 01:32:58,972
只是为了给他一个偷更多的借口
an excuse to steal some more

1174
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,207
但是你不一样
But not you

1175
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:05,812
这里并没有添置新东西
There's nothing new around here,

1176
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:10,216
除了他们的抽油机
except them pumpjacks

1177
01:33:10,218 --> 01:33:11,952
每个月赚的钱
Each one of them making you a month

1178
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:13,286
都比你和你哥哥偷的钱多
what you and your brother stole

1179
01:33:13,288 --> 01:33:15,088
从那四家银行
from all four banks combined

1180
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:18,158
帮我解开这个谜团
Help me understand, then

1181
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:25,332
让我明白为什么四个人死了
Help me understand why four people died

1182
01:33:25,334 --> 01:33:29,169
你偷了钱但是并没有花掉
so you could steal money that it don't seem
you've spent,

1183
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:30,370
似乎你也不缺钱
that it don't seem you need

1184
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:32,872
你有家庭吗？
You got a family?

1185
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:35,875
我的搭档有家庭，很大一家子
My partner had a family A big one

1186
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:38,044
不过他们的后院没有抽油机
They don't got no pumpjacks in their backyard

1187
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:39,045
我没有杀死你的朋友
I didn't kill your friend

1188
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:40,246
是的，你干了
Yes, you did

1189
01:33:41,882 --> 01:33:45,352
通过计划具体的行动
By setting this thing in motion

1190
01:33:45,354 --> 01:33:48,188
你希望我是你的蠢笨兄弟计划的？
You expect me to believe your dimwitted brother
planned this?

1191
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:53,960
哦，不，这一切都太聪明了，是你
Oh, no This was smart, this was you

1192
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,265
我一辈子都很穷
I've been poor my whole life

1193
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:05,372
我的父母也一样，他们的父母也一样
So were my parents,their parents before them

1194
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:09,309
就像是疾病
It's like a disease

1195
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:13,713
一代一代的遗传下来
passing from generation to generation,

1196
01:34:13,715 --> 01:34:14,881
变成了顽疾
becomes a sickness, that's what it is

1197
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:18,885
传染给你认识的每一个人
Infects every person you know,

1198
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,354
但是我的儿子不再是了
but not my boys

1199
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:23,990
不再是了
Not anymore

1200
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:29,396
这里是他们的了
This is theirs now

1201
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,236
现在，我绝不会再杀人了
Now, I ain't never killed no one in my life,

1202
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:37,404
如果你想我跟你走
but if you want me to start with you,

1203
01:34:37,406 --> 01:34:39,105
让我们相安无事，老家伙
let's get on with it, old man

1204
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,308
看看你能否掏出枪
See if you can grab that pistol

1205
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,910
在我把你从走廊轰下去之前
before I blast you off this porch

1206
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,218
你好，怎么了？
Howdy What's going on?

1207
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:29,856
这些猪又回到花园了
The hogs are back in the garden

1208
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:31,991
野猪把这地方搞的乱七八糟
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce

1209
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:35,061
这是谁？
Who's this?

1210
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,463
我是你丈夫的老朋友
I'm an old friend of your husband

1211
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:38,965
前夫
Ex-husband

1212
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:42,235
我只是来收拾一下房子
I'm just working on the house

1213
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:45,438
哦，你不住在这里？
Oh, you don't live here?

1214
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,108
不，这不是我的，是他们的
No, it's not mine, It's theirs

1215
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:52,512
哦
Oh

1216
01:35:52,514 --> 01:35:54,814
我们做的一切都是为了孩子，对吗？
The things we do for our kids, huh?

1217
01:35:57,318 --> 01:35:58,418
好……
Well

1218
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:02,021
我得走了
I best be going

1219
01:36:02,023 --> 01:36:03,356

1221
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:08,128
明天早上9点回来把前面的活干完
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front

1222
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:09,229
开始粉刷外墙
Start painting the extension

1223
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:10,864
然后帮着Randy做作业
and then help Randy with his homework

1224
01:36:10,866 --> 01:36:12,766
当他从学校回来的时候，好吗？
when he gets back from school, okay?

1225
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:14,534
好吧
Okay

1226
01:36:17,972 --> 01:36:19,072
嗨
Hey

1227
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:22,242
我在镇上租了一间小房子
I'm renting a little house in town

1228
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:26,179
如果你路过的时候
If you wanna stop by and finish this conversation

1229
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:27,247
随时欢迎你
you're welcome anytime

1230
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:30,216
哦， 我喜欢那样

1231

我会看着你的

1232
01:36:32,821 --> 01:36:35,421
是的，快了，我希望
Yeah Soon, I hope

1233
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:39,893
我已经准备好结束这些了
I'm ready to be done with this

1234
01:36:39,895 --> 01:36:42,195
无论如何你绝对不能再做了
You'll never be done with it no matter what

1235
01:36:42,197 --> 01:36:45,565
它会追着你的，在你的余生
It's gonna haunt you, son, for the rest of your days

1236
01:36:45,567 --> 01:36:49,369
但是你不会孤独它也会追着我的
But you won't be alone It's gonna haunt me, too

1237
01:36:49,371 --> 01:36:51,437
如果你停手，也许我会给你和平
If you stop by, maybe I'll give you peace

1238
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,208
也许，也许我会给你的
Maybe Maybe I'll give it to you
