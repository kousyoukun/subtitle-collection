1
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,036
...and Bannister has done it.

2
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,362
Now, he's out on his feet. His
coach and team manager tell him

3
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:43,478
he's achieved his ambition, a
mile in three minutes 59.4 seconds.

4
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:46,046
Jimmy Hines
is going to win the race!

5
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:49,788
Jim Hines is the winner! Lennox
Miller, second, Charlie Greene, third.

6
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:53,575
Jim Hines is the world's
fastest human.

7
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:57,100
He breaks the world record
by an astonishing margin,

8
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:59,189
one minute and 17 seconds.

9
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:04,064
And history has been made in
Berlin in astonishing style.

10
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,723
You are go for landing. Over.

11
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,861
Roger. Understand.
Go for landing. 3,000 feet.

12
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:24,084
Altitude, 1600. 1400
feet, still looking very good.

13
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,128
We're go.

14
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,217
We're go.

15
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,479
Contact light.

16
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:29,828
OK, engine stop.

17
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:31,352
We copy you down, Eagle.

18
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:34,920
It's one small step for man,

19
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,750
one giant leap for mankind.

20
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,641
Welcome to a foggy
morning here in Vienna, Austria,

21
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:03,340
where one man will attempt to go
where no man has been before.

22
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:06,691
Pushing his body and
mind to the limit

23
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,651
with the aid of scientific research
and meticulous preparation,

24
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:14,612
Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge will hope
to run 26.2 miles in under two hours

25
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,356
and, in doing so, beat one of the
great sporting barriers of our time.

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,144
Kipchoge! Kipchoge!
Kipchoge! Kipchoge!

27
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,470
Hicham El Guerrouj
coming home,

28
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:10,821
Eliud Kipchoge, Kenenisa Bekele.

29
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:15,609
Kipchoge in the red.
Can he get to the finals? Yes!

30
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:19,482
Kipchoge edging out
Hicham El Guerrouj!

31
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,354
Eighteen years of
age. Eliud Kipchoge.

32
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:25,183
You know, you hear about child
prodigies that can play the piano.

33
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:28,230
How can you do this at 18, when
you should be a senior in high school?

34
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:16,539
You know, science has it
that the first man to run 42K

35
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,280
below two hours,

36
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,195
will do it in about 2075.

37
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:23,372
That is 50 years from now.
He wants to do it now.

38
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:43,871
His mind is...
 It's something you can't describe.

39
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,443
Berlin, 2015,

40
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:55,883
he is running at kilometer-five
and the insoles are flapping out.

41
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,583
And you're saying...
this guy will drop from this

42
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,542
because it will cause blisters.

43
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,981
But he went on, and
actually set his personal best.

44
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:10,593
So you look at him and you say,
"OK, this is magical."

45
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:13,640
Because you were seeing
somebody here with a mind that,

46
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:16,991
if he puts it on something,
nothing will distract him from it.

47
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,253
He will go for it.

48
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:21,299
Kipchoge puts his foot down.

49
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:24,564
The London Marathon
belongs to Eliud Kipchoge.

50
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,000
Eliud Kipchoge.

51
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:29,351
Eliud Kipchoge,
arguably the greatest ever.

52
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:32,006
This will be
the first sub 2:02 clocking,

53
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:35,487
and by a monstrous margin, he
is going to break the world record.

54
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:40,667
Particularly in marathon running,
he is the greatest ever, by a long way.

55
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,670
The quickest.
A man who knows how to win.

56
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:57,031
Sang is second.
One, two, three for Kenya.

57
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,387
I was a fortunate guy

58
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,044
to have had help from so many
people throughout my childhood years.

59
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,699
All the way to being a runner.

60
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:15,310
So, when I came back, one
of the things that I wanted to do

61
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,181
was to give back
to the community.

62
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:24,058
So I was actively involved in
helping young athletes in this country.

63
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:31,195
Somehow Eliud knew
that I was in this position,

64
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,545
and he came to me
like any other youngster

65
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,852
asking for a training plan.

66
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,858
I would give him a training plan
for two weeks,

67
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:44,687
and he would come,
religiously, every two weeks,

68
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,646
to ask for more.

69
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,653
But at one point he told me,

70
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,264
"I've made the regional team
to go to the Nationals.

71
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,615
I want to be guided."

72
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:07,014
He also told me that he took up
running because he used to see me run

73
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:11,583
at the high school, and said
why don't I try, like this guy?

74
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,977
And that's why he was coming to
me for advice.

75
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,199
So that was the beginning.

76
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,724
He breaks the world record

77
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,683
by an astonishing margin.

78
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:29,036
One minute and 17 seconds.
Patrick Sang, his coach, his companion

79
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:33,736
for run after run, race after
race, year after year.

80
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,877
It's just pure trust.

81
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,489
He never asks what are we going to
do next week, next month, tomorrow.

82
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:50,753
And I think, without trust, you
cannot go far in this business.

83
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,673
All of us in life, we go through
different phases.

84
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,675
And any situation
gives you lessons.

85
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:04,767
And it depends on how you
interact with that background.

86
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:08,728
Some will take it positively,
and use it positively.

87
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,570
You know,
there have been so many theories

88
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:28,530
why we have this
rich pool of talent.

89
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:31,446
I believe strongly in the theory
of Darwin,

90
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,230
the survival of the fittest.

91
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:37,495
Most of our athletes
come from humble backgrounds.

92
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:41,761
You have to fight,
you have to be strong.

93
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,851
And I think in Kenya,

94
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:48,332
the strictures that were laid
down by the colonial government

95
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:51,074
to compete for the Empire
in the Empire Games

96
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:56,471
meant a tradition was formed
under that unfriendly regime.

97
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:59,561
And I think over time
they were perfected.

98
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,911
Keino making this crowd roar.

99
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:04,392
He is now 15 yards clear.

100
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:09,179
When you pass a place, you
leave some dust in your wake.

101
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:12,704
And some dust can throw in
something glittering.

102
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,924
I think that would be something
that glitters

103
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:19,015
out of the unfriendly dust that
we experienced as a country.

104
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:23,193
The people here in Kenya,
masses of the Africans here in Kenya,

105
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,935
are probably
roughly at about the same stage

106
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,981
Great Britain was 500 years ago.

107
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,073
We do not think that the normal
forms of democracy are suitable.

108
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:35,205
Simpson in second
place. O'Brien is third.

109
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:39,253
Wilkinson is fourth, and surely
no one will catch the African.

110
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,777
People heard
through the radio

111
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,867
that there was this great guy
who could run so fast,

112
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,956
and his name was Kip Keino.

113
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,132
And Keino
is going faster,

114
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,917
and Simpson is
going harder, too.

115
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:52,919
He was a household name.

116
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,573
There were songs sung about him.

117
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:58,794
When we were kids, we used to
say, "Run like Kip Keino!"

118
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:17,639
You get one person from an area
running very well,

119
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:21,773
then he becomes a mentor to many
others. There is an example to follow.

120
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:26,082
But then, there is dominance
on the Kalenjin group,

121
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:28,911
particularly where long-distance
running is concerned.

122
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,143
Every single time Eliud laces his
shoes and takes the guys out for a run,

123
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:44,971
he doesn't have to say anything.

124
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:48,844
If you're in that camp, all you
have to do is see in his eyes.

125
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:50,977
You know, his dedication

126
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,718
and his will to just keep
pushing every single time.

127
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,856
For you to succeed
in the majority of these things,

128
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,772
you have got to get a team
that believes in your dream.

129
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:06,949
You are the vision carrier.

130
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:12,041
But the cast that supports you
have also to believe

131
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:14,304
and commit to the dream.

132
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,398
Eliud is super consistent
in whatever he does.

133
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,444
It's all about discipline.

134
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:27,665
It's a storm of conditions that come
together to make this man who he is.

135
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,538
He's got
an incredible physiology.

136
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,845
He's got incredible efficiency
as an athlete.

137
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:39,503
And he's got an absolutely incredible
mind. I mean, an incredible mind.

138
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,908
He is the perfect shape.

139
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,607
He has almost perfect posture.

140
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:59,915
He puts his feet down...
and it's a dream.

141
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,396
He almost floats.

142
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:11,622
Athletics is an individual sport
and Eliud is able

143
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,886
to make an individual sport
a kind of team sport

144
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,280
with the way he
does things in camp.

145
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:22,068
He feels it's a way of inspiring people.
That is something which I see in Eliud

146
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,679
that you don't see
in almost any other athlete.

147
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,348
Running is
a taxing exercise.

148
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,698
It takes a lot of energy
from the system.

149
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:46,918
The set-up we have in Kaptagat

150
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,443
is an ideal environment
where somebody

151
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:53,186
can have around them the right
people to give them moral support.

152
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:59,192
Eliud has really helped
young people, and some of us

153
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:03,022
because what you see from him
makes you believe

154
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,416
that if this person can do this,
also I can do that.

155
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,854
He is a mentor
to so many young athletes.

156
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,814
Squat! Get into the
squatting position.

157
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,338
Open. Close.

158
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,601
Two. Close.

159
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,648
Three. Close. Four. Close.

160
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,966
People look up to him

161
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,014
because he's not trying to be
something else.

162
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,756
He's completely sincere.

163
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,544
The camp is a
really special place.

164
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:51,548
The athletes organize everything
in camp themselves.

165
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,160
It is very austere.

166
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:59,774
But I think you then get
connected with what really matters.

167
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:04,779
You can get with very little.
All the other things are fluff.

168
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,570
There are so many things
that I've learned from him.

169
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:17,096
One of them is
really... be humble.

170
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,404
No matter what success you
achieve in your life, always be humble.

171
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:30,457
In his case, humility is
something that's absolutely core.

172
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,241
He doesn't even think about it.

173
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,549
It's a natural thing that
emanates out from him, really.

174
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:38,073
It's central to the way
that he operates.

175
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:14,109
This is the best training
area for running.

176
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:16,155
Elite athletes.

177
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,506
For that person
who is aspiring to be the best.

178
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,381
We believe in our
fitness, we believe in the team

179
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:28,079
that we have selected
to help Eliud.

180
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:31,822
We believe in the coaching
that's been provided for us.

181
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,737
So we have a strong team.

182
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,043
We do half squat.

183
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:38,916
At the end of the day,
all you can do is just

184
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,484
train, eat, rest, and repeat.

185
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:22,063
High-altitude training
does them a lot of good.

186
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:26,328
You develop a higher
red blood cell count

187
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,287
that transports the oxygen.

188
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,203
So when you go and run now at sea
level, you find you have an advantage

189
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,380
because you're able to carry
the oxygen through

190
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,295
much easier than
the other person.

191
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,915
An elite athlete will be used to
having to capture the oxygen very well.

192
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:53,616
Their genomes are crafted
by the evolutionary process

193
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,317
to produce the proteins necessary
to capture the oxygen easily,

194
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,319
because the oxygen is thin.

195
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:03,452
But it can't be just that.

196
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:10,241
The elite performers in Kenya are
also inheriting the right epigenome.

197
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,941
That is, the ability to maintain
those controls

198
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:18,598
over, not only your muscles,
but also the rest of the body.

199
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:22,863
How we behave, the lifestyle,
the training,

200
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:27,650
the ways in which the body
tells the genome what to do.

201
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,100
I've been fascinated
throughout my career

202
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:47,931
by why certain ethnic groups
have excelled in sport.

203
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:51,370
If you asked me in 2000,
I would have said it's genetic.

204
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,895
But 20 years later,
it's very clear to me,

205
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,766
and it's actually
well accepted now,

206
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:02,293
that what we're observing is a
socio-economic cultural phenomenon.

207
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:06,602
The very best, or the very,
very unique individuals,

208
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:09,431
where genetics
plays a massive role

209
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:12,129
but genes alone
will not produce success.

210
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:14,088
You need that right environment.

211
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:39,940
You close your eyes
and you think about Kenya.

212
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,594
You think about athletes,

213
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:45,162
and you think about
extraordinary performances.

214
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:50,472
And there is an ambition, an
aspiration, amongst young Kenyan kids

215
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,996
to want to be great runners.

216
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:02,919
When we came out
of colonial administration,

217
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,791
we became independent.

218
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:08,882
And our first experience as a
country in international competitions

219
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:12,494
was so positive because
we won medals from the word go.

220
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:17,760
And that, in itself, set a tradition
that every young athlete coming up

221
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:22,722
has a bar that is already set.
And that bar is that

222
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:26,726
if you come with anything less
than a gold, you are not good.

223
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,250
The Kenyans train
to be the best.

224
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:33,428
And that's, like, a mindset
that is very strong for them.

225
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:09,420
Amongst all the Kalenjin
group that are running,

226
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:12,423
there are those that can have
a very low pain threshold.

227
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,818
That problem that would
actually make another athlete drop,

228
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,472
Eliud would finish with it.

229
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:21,911
His body is exceptional,

230
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:24,305
because he is able to block

231
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:27,264
that disruption, that irritation
that the pain is causing,

232
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:29,789
and put it at the back of his
mind until the race is over.

233
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,881
Actually, his biggest
asset, his mind,

234
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,797
carries him through
those very trying moments.

235
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,324
He is very
strong mentally.

236
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:47,154
He has really developed a way
of overcoming the pain.

237
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:49,286
He always smiles,
he always concentrates,

238
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,941
he always keeps focus
on what he does.

239
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,117
And I've tried and
it really works.

240
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:57,556
You smile a bit, and you forget
about the pain and just keep moving.

241
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:03,866
When you're exercising,

242
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,260
and you're competing
at a very high level,

243
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,523
you are doing much more
than just running.

244
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:14,181
You are also putting yourself into a
state of mind in which you can do it.

245
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:16,096
It's a meditative state.

246
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:22,624
You have to align the
mind and the whole body,

247
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:26,933
so that when you tell it to
move, it moves as you direct.

248
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,979
If you have a disconnect
between those two things,

249
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:33,026
that's when you start losing
the momentum,

250
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,290
and it becomes a nightmare
for you to sustain.

251
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,126
We are here
at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza

252
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:49,303
to see if we can really break
this barrier.

253
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:53,307
This is something that has been
in the making for two years.

254
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,875
Breaking the two hours
is incredible pressure.

255
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:58,834
He experienced that
for the first time in Monza.

256
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:01,750
That kind of pressure which is
different than going for Olympics

257
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,448
or for London Marathon
or anything else.

258
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:08,583
And I think in Monza,
he was learning to handle it.

259
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:12,456
It was really hard for him
to convince himself

260
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,676
that he was going to run
under two hours.

261
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:20,551
It took him six, seven months
to prepare physically,

262
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:23,467
but mainly, mentally,
to be ready on the starting line

263
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:27,515
that he had really internalized
that he was going to achieve it.

264
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:33,260
At that time he came from
a personal best of 2:03:05.

265
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,305
So he had to prepare his mind

266
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:38,569
to go three minutes faster than
he had ever had done in his life.

267
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:41,572
Believe me,
that's not just a first place,

268
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:44,314
that is a moment of
marathon history.

269
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:47,230
At Monza, it was very
clear it was a very big step.

270
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:50,146
I remember going to the
racecourse at Monza

271
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,280
and thinking to myself,
"Three minutes. That's a lot!"

272
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:55,151
Thirty seconds.

273
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:01,201
Nine, eight, seven, six...

274
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,376
He was courageous.

275
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,683
He said,
"I'm going to give 100 percent."

276
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,250
And he did.

277
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:13,604
The three most
important points from Monza were

278
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,477
that we didn't get enough
carbohydrates inside Eliud.

279
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,436
The drinks didn't
work as we wanted.

280
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,657
The weather was not ideal.
The rain. And it was very humid.

281
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,965
And the other thing for Eliud
was always the crowd.

282
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,444
There was nobody there.

283
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,185
But that's also part of sports,
you know?

284
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:31,448
If we can predict everything,
why are we here?

285
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:33,102
You know, this is life.

286
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:55,081
He almost succeeded,
but he missed by 25 seconds.

287
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,929
It was a
learning curve for me.

288
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:20,802
He showed me a different
character of himself.

289
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:24,588
That the mind that we thought
was, "He has a strong mind,"

290
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,765
was stronger than we thought.

291
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:45,000
The most successful people are
the ones that are not afraid of fear.

292
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:48,308
They try, and if they fail,
they come back again.

293
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:52,834
That belief that he has
that no human is limited...

294
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:56,751
It means, once you train your mind
on something, you will achieve it.

295
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:05,064
The difference
between the good and the great

296
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:09,808
is that your head may be telling
you you possibly can't do it,

297
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,722
but there is
something else there

298
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:14,595
that overrules
all those cautious thoughts.

299
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:17,380
And you think, "Fuck it, I can.
And I'm gonna go for it."

300
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:38,140
We're in a different era right
now

301
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:42,753
where people believe these guys
like Eliud are actually making sure

302
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:45,495
that the generation
that will follow

303
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,759
are going to think,
"We are going to be running 2:00

304
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:53,634
on an open marathon, or that is
not going to be good enough."

305
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:56,376
Haile Gebrselassie
writes yet another chapter

306
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:00,119
in the most astonishing
distance-running career in history.

307
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:05,994
In 2008, Haile Gebrselassie ran
for the first time under 2:04 in Berlin.

308
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:10,477
Then more and more people are
asking, "Two hours, when will it happen?"

309
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,393
If you look at the curve
of the marathon records,

310
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,395
it would take
another 30, 40 years.

311
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:23,707
To do the impossible...
and I almost still believe

312
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:27,929
that breaking a two-hour marathon
is impossible, because I run!

313
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:31,019
And the idea of running every
kilometer at two minutes 50

314
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:33,369
is impossible in my view.

315
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:38,722
That requires this combination of
an athlete that is truly superhuman,

316
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:42,117
but also incredibly meticulous
organization

317
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,555
to get him to the point
where he could break two hours.

318
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:55,739
It was that feeling of, "Holy
shit, this is the real deal."

319
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,872
We've got this responsibility
to this athlete

320
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,743
who's only going to
get this one chance.

321
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:02,746
When you're going into something
at the highest level,

322
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,966
you're really under
a huge amount of pressure,

323
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,925
you have to have
done the preparation.

324
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:10,580
You have to know in your mind
that you've done all you possibly can.

325
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:14,019
In the first instance, you pull
together a little team of people,

326
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:16,543
your safe team, as it were...
So, obviously, we got Tim in.

327
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:18,937
Tim's background was in rowing,

328
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,897
swimming, and he is now the
most decorated coach in cycling.

329
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,988
What he does have is a knowledge
of performance physiology

330
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:29,904
and an ability to apply that
to a range of sports.

331
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,297
One A and one B.

332
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,125
I met Valentijn,

333
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,954
who is a performance manager
and looks after Eliud and his team,

334
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,913
and we hit it off straight away.

335
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,441
One of the greatest challenges in the
first instance, was to find the course.

336
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:47,487
On that side we
had Hugh Brasher,

337
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,751
who many will know is the
director of London Marathon.

338
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:55,147
So you had Valentijn, Hugh and myself
as a sort of senior management team.

339
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,066
And then there were other people
in our team.

340
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:03,372
Fran Millar, obviously
who works very closely with me.

341
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:08,116
Peter Vint who was in charge of all
the cars and the lasers and the timing.

342
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,075
Spencer had got all the pacers

343
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:13,992
and Robby Ketchell who'd
worked on the Nike project.

344
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:18,300
I mean, a brilliant guy. A scientist,
meteorologist, aerodynamicist.

345
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:20,215
I mean, phenomenally bright guy.

346
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,391
And that's one of the challenges

347
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:24,959
when you take experts from
different fields and different sports

348
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:29,050
and you try and pull them together,
you've got to have the chemistry.

349
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:31,768
We're going to have to move fast,
we're going to have to have open minds,

350
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:35,317
and communicate really, really
frequently and move at pace.

351
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:42,411
Timothy and Emanuel, you just...
you start also behind.

352
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:44,370
Because we are all
on the starting line.

353
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,937
- We will not start in this formation.
- Oh, yes.

354
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:49,462
We are starting on the line
and then, boom, go...

355
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:53,379
Normally, we race to win.
We win medals, we win races.

356
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:57,644
We go to the Olympics, or the Tour
de France, we win stuff in competitions.

357
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:01,561
This event is different. This is
about breaking a human barrier.

358
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,132
So we had to really think about
this in a slightly different way

359
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:10,787
and make sure the philosophy
of the whole attempt was based

360
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:12,963
on a performance
-first mentality.

361
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:17,707
What's going to get us to that record?
What's going to help the performance?

362
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:21,711
And if we have to work harder,
invest more, find a different way,

363
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:24,671
find a different solution for all
the other aspects of the event

364
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:27,630
that will fit around it,
then that's what we'd do.

365
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:32,766
He had run a fantastic time
in the London Marathon,

366
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:35,116
and we thought, actually,
if he ran no worse,

367
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,902
the same physical performance
that he did in London,

368
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:42,123
then could we look for
the marginal gains?

369
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,169
The optimizers,
as we'd call them.

370
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:47,694
So, make sure the surface of the
road is absolutely perfect.

371
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,304
Perfect weather conditions.

372
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:52,612
We wanted the corners to be
more than 32 meters' radius.

373
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:55,136
What's the thermoregulation?
What's the fueling strategy?

374
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,052
What's the pacing strategy?
The aerodynamics?

375
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,315
All of those elements
were critical in essentially

376
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,709
what, for me, would
be marginal gains.

377
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:06,191
We improve shoes, we
improve drinks, all these things.

378
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:08,280
But that's natural.

379
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:11,346
In ten years, we will be again finding
out more things, and different things.

380
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,547
It's just a point in history
where we are at at the moment

381
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,115
and we are speeding up
a little bit of history.

382
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:42,227
I always wanted it
to be somewhere iconic

383
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,403
because it's such
a special event.

384
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:47,493
I didn't really want to be in an
airfield in Norfolk, you know?

385
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:51,236
Or somewhere in northern Germany
because those were a couple of ideas.

386
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,194
You get a flat course
and it's very manageable

387
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:55,414
because there's no people
around, there's no traffic.

388
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,372
You have to deal with all that.

389
00:35:57,416 --> 00:36:00,245
If you're going to do this, it should
really be in an iconic location.

390
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,608
This course is actually
something really special.

391
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,482
When we came and saw it for
the first time, all of us looked at it

392
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:22,876
and said immediately,
"I think we found our place."

393
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,969
You come here and even before you
think about all of the physics around it,

394
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:31,363
and the environment
that you are trying to run in,

395
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:34,714
you get a feeling of, "This
is somewhere I can run fast."

396
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,285
It was June 13.

397
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:46,116
Thirteen minutes past eight,
I've got the call. It's Vienna.

398
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,771
It starts me crying a little
bit, just for a moment.

399
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,256
To have Eliud here,
and all those pacemakers?

400
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,303
It was the best that ever
could happen for Vienna.

401
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:03,351
So on this circuit, we have
a 4.3 kilometer section here

402
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:06,789
that we are walking on
almost perfectly flat.

403
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,662
It only has an elevation change
of about 2.4 meters

404
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:11,316
from one end to the other.

405
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,666
He's going to do 4.4 laps on it,

406
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:17,974
so that means that he is going
to do this about 8.5 times.

407
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:22,762
And there are roundabouts that are
located conveniently on either side.

408
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,983
Just having that circuit there
was enough for us to decide

409
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,985
that this is an
optimal location.

410
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,642
When you approach anything like
this, a big undertaking,

411
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:36,602
it's like being in a field where there's
mist and you can't see anything.

412
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,754
You don't know where the fence
is or where the edges are.

413
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:42,260
But you know there's a gate somewhere.
You know you can get out of the field.

414
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,175
But until the fog lifts, you're not
going to be able to find the gate.

415
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:47,482
And it felt like that at the
beginning of the project.

416
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,397
And as the fog lifted,

417
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:52,531
it was literally like all of the
elements started to fall into place.

418
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:55,751
An order fell across
the whole project.

419
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,927
People really seemed
to buy this concept

420
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:01,409
of, "We're doing something
that no one has ever done."

421
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,324
Like, that's special.
That's unique.

422
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:06,545
There was a genuine magic to it,
you know?

423
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:23,126
He is Zen-like in his
approach and his preparation.

424
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:26,521
And watching him
at close quarters develop

425
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:29,829
from the end of the finishing
line in the London Marathon,

426
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,613
in those few months coming up,

427
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:34,094
coming up to the level
of when he was ready

428
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:36,836
to execute that performance,
was something else.

429
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:40,274
How he approached
that was very special.

430
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:46,367
Not only did he believe in
himself, he had a brilliant way

431
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:49,588
of making everybody around him
believe in him, too.

432
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:54,549
The impact that has on everybody
else around him in a project...

433
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:58,031
Not only the other support
runners and the pacemakers,

434
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:00,860
but all of the staff,
the coaching staff, the experts,

435
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,949
everybody who was
working night and day

436
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:06,692
to try and bring all this
project together, that's special.

437
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:18,111
OK, good luck,
Gabs. Here we go.

438
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:20,548
Cameras, keep offering
what you can. Thank you.

439
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,813
Seven... six... five...

440
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,729
three... two...

441
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:29,513
one.

442
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:34,649
Well, the waiting
is over. The moment has arrived.

443
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:38,348
We are just moments away.
And there he is.

444
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,350
You know, thousands,
if not millions, of people

445
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:43,049
will be going out for
a Saturday run today.

446
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:48,228
Well, this could be the most famous
Saturday run the world has ever seen.

447
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:53,625
And it's all about this man,
Eliud Kipchoge from Kenya.

448
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:02,634
The sub two
hour marathon is considered

449
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,679
the Everest of distance running.

450
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:09,467
Something that people, for a long
time, thought was nearly impossible,

451
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,381
we wouldn't see
in our lifetimes.

452
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:13,732
And in the last few years,
it's suddenly hoved into view.

453
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:17,039
And we might see it today.
It's very exciting.

454
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,289
We've already got crowds

455
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:37,206
who are all expectant of history
being made today in Vienna.

456
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,600
He's done everything
there is to do in this sport.

457
00:42:39,644 --> 00:42:42,821
This is the last barrier.
The two-hour marathon.

458
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:45,606
This would be his legacy.

459
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,261
Every i has been
dotted, every t crossed.

460
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,132
Is he going to do it?

461
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:53,483
The weather, the fact that it's
foggy, a bit foggier than expected,

462
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:56,617
throws another little doubt,
maybe, into the minds.

463
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:58,619
This is not a
foregone conclusion.

464
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,122
So we are into the final few
minutes before countdown.

465
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:25,298
- Fifteen seconds.
- Stand by, everyone.

466
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:27,082
Stand by three, stand by five.

467
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:30,564
- Here we go.
- Stand by ten.

468
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:44,360
From the president to the
simple Kenyan in a village,

469
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:48,538
we want to witness history
being made.

470
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:51,541
And we are confident that today,
God willing,

471
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:53,718
we will have a celebration

472
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:59,201
and 1:59 is going to be a
reality. Thank you very much.

473
00:44:50,035 --> 00:44:54,474
We have lift-off.
Apollo Kipchoge is up and away.

474
00:45:56,928 --> 00:46:00,148
The race, when it started,
it was beautiful.

475
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:02,803
As a coach, you know,
you look at the body language.

476
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:08,853
I saw the eyes of Eliud in the camera
and he was very focused and relaxed.

477
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:13,335
Everybody was psyched up.
The pacers were in high spirits

478
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:15,947
and I said,
"It's going to be a good day."

479
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,168
When he started
the race, I was nervous.

480
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:22,344
But when I saw how
he was running,

481
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:27,001
he was really in good shape,
and the pacers were also.

482
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,353
I was nervous... exciting...

483
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:32,746
And...

484
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,053
I had faith that he could do it.

485
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:40,188
We had a starting-race plan.
If everything went perfectly,

486
00:46:40,232 --> 00:46:43,844
the plan was to go at the
first kilometer at 2:48: 0.

487
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:47,717
And every other kilometer
after that 2:50:45

488
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:50,198
which would give
a finish time of 1:59:50.

489
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:55,987
The speed
at which they are traveling

490
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,858
is quite extraordinary.

491
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:00,861
It's worth trying to put it into
some sort of layman's terms.

492
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:03,864
He is going to be running,
or trying to run, consistently

493
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,474
at 13 miles an hour.

494
00:47:05,518 --> 00:47:07,955
Twenty-one kilometers an hour.

495
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:09,609
It's mind blowing.

496
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:12,742
I challenge people to go
to their local track

497
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:17,965
and just run one lap, 400 meters
of the track, in 68 seconds.

498
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:19,662
I bet you not many
people can do that!

499
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,928
This is crazy!

500
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,147
We can
break this down in so many ways.

501
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:30,195
One lap of the track,
at your local track, 68 seconds.

502
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:35,765
And he has to do that 105 times.
Each hundred meters in 17 seconds.

503
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:39,900
And he will be doing
that 422 times.

504
00:47:42,468 --> 00:47:46,298
We are very familiar in cycling
with the concept of aerodynamics

505
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:50,606
and riding behind another one. A
teammate taking the brunt of the wind

506
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,392
and having to really
tire themselves out

507
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:56,917
so the person behind can be
fresher and then try and go for the win.

508
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:00,529
So Robby and the
aerodynamics team

509
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:05,143
set about looking at the formations
that were traditional in running.

510
00:48:05,186 --> 00:48:07,928
And, also, throwing out
some creative ideas.

511
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:11,192
They ran their CFD models,
and their computer models,

512
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:14,456
and we made models, and the
miniature models went in the wind tunnel.

513
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,284
Positioned them all, et cetera.

514
00:48:16,328 --> 00:48:18,199
Lo and behold, they came back
and they said,

515
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:21,028
"Actually, we found something
pretty interesting."

516
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:24,814
In a typical marathon,
if he was to run by himself,

517
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:27,165
he would have about
six Newtons of drag.

518
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:33,475
We've come up with a formation that
has reduced that to about one Newton.

519
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,044
It's a huge improvement in the
drag that he'll have when he's running.

520
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:39,960
So the pacers have a huge impact

521
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:42,702
on being able to help Eliud
break two hours.

522
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:43,745
Come on, guys!

523
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,489
I was there when he
did the test in the winter,

524
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:49,404
and it was fascinating to know.

525
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:52,886
We always thought pacemaking
would be like the birds flying in the sky

526
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,932
in the open-V formation.

527
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,238
But it turned out not to be a V.

528
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:58,936
It turned out to be a Y.

529
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:05,768
There are five runners in front
of Eliud and two behind him.

530
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:09,468
The front-runners will be
positioned over here on the sides

531
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:11,122
and there will be two of them.

532
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:13,776
But there will be a gap in
between them which is not natural.

533
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,606
That's part of the reason that training
them how to run like this was difficult.

534
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,654
Behind those two runners
will be two more runners

535
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:25,005
that are positioned further in,
so we're starting to create a V.

536
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:28,878
Then, behind them will be the
captain who runs in front of Eliud.

537
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:32,099
At some point, Fosbury
did his flop for the first time.

538
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:34,928
And people went,
"What? What's he doing?"

539
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,538
And yet it worked.

540
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:39,628
So we said, "Why isn't this
the Fosbury flop of running?"

541
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:42,892
We were maximizing what we call
the outwash around each runner.

542
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:46,287
So the outwash means that when
wind hits a runner on the torso,

543
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:49,812
it changes the direction of the wind,
and it's going to go out to the sides.

544
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:51,292
So, in effect,
what was happening,

545
00:49:51,336 --> 00:49:54,165
the air was hitting the guy
that was on the outside.

546
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:56,950
Some of the air was coming
outside, some was going inside.

547
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,606
A guy on the inside of him,
on his shoulder,

548
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:04,218
was then getting the air coming
from guy number one,

549
00:50:04,262 --> 00:50:07,569
plus the air hitting him. So
quite a lot more air, in fact.

550
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:11,878
And, of course, this is happening
on two sides of the funnel, as it were.

551
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:15,534
So the air, eventually, was
funneled right into the middle,

552
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:18,972
and the guy who was in the
center in the middle, took a lot of air.

553
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,018
He was getting
quite a buffeting!

554
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:23,803
And what happened was,
it created a big wake.

555
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:27,850
It actually created a nice little hole
where there was pretty much still air.

556
00:50:32,768 --> 00:50:34,988
In that wake is where
Eliud needs to try to run

557
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,295
as close to the captain
in front of him.

558
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:40,254
Typically, you wouldn't run
there. Your visibility isn't the best.

559
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:42,778
You also don't want to trip.

560
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:45,085
So you don't want to step on the
runner in front of you.

561
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:47,479
They'll kick back and
vary a little bit.

562
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,308
The absolute trust

563
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:54,660
between all eight people at any
one time cannot be overstated.

564
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:57,880
Bernard Lagat there, right at
the heart of it, the initial captain.

565
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,970
And he will be handing over
shortly to the second team

566
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:04,322
and Eric Kiptanui
will be the second captain.

567
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:08,021
This event was always going
to have a bit of ballet about it.

568
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,111
You needed everyone to know what
they were doing, what their steps were.

569
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:13,853
We said, "OK, it's a big risk,
we haven't got much time.

570
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:16,769
We'll have to practice this
thing. If we go with this,

571
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:20,294
then we want to make sure, as
much as we can, that it's right."

572
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:22,209
It is kind of tricky,

573
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:25,038
but then, as a captain,
I need to keep my guys calm.

574
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,302
I want to make sure that they understand
the formation, to stay in their lanes.

575
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:32,393
At the same time, note that they are
the ones controlling the pace in the front.

576
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:36,484
The captain was the leader.
He was in charge of all the pacers

577
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:41,010
to make sure they executed exactly
what they were supposed to execute.

578
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:56,243
This is like the queen bee,
protected by the drones and the others

579
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:00,682
and it's that beautiful thing,
the exchange of the pacemakers!

580
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:02,815
And we're keeping
an eye out here

581
00:52:02,858 --> 00:52:04,164
for the first change-over.

582
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:07,036
As I think Shalane was
likening... Here we go!

583
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,038
Shalane, talk us through this.

584
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:11,737
Yeah, I was likening it to, in
the US, a NASCAR pit stop,

585
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:16,655
where we change our tires,
fine tune the machine...

586
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:18,222
Same thing goes here for Eliud.

587
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:20,354
He's switching out
and getting fresh runners

588
00:52:20,398 --> 00:52:23,444
that are hopefully smoothly
transitioning into formation

589
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:27,796
so that Eliud can just draft, and
conserve as much energy as possible.

590
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,711
Those changes
were not easy.

591
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:33,498
One slip, one wrong turn with a
trip-up, and it could all be over.

592
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:36,588
We wanted to maintain the pace

593
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:39,721
as well as the team exiting
and the team coming in.

594
00:52:39,765 --> 00:52:41,984
So we want the team
that is going out

595
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:45,292
to really move out smoothly
and maintain the pace.

596
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:48,730
Then we also want the team going
in to come in smoothly,

597
00:52:48,774 --> 00:52:50,689
not distracting Eliud.

598
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:57,826
We probably have 40 of
the top athletes on the planet

599
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,742
and they're all working
for a common cause

600
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,353
and one man, which is Eliud.

601
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:04,224
The man
at the heart of it,

602
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:06,095
he's already the
world record-holder,

603
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:08,228
and he is surrounded
by his band of brothers.

604
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:12,145
We've got 15 Kenyans, seven
Americans, six Ugandans.

605
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,367
We've got Australians, Norwegians,
Ethiopians and one Japanese pacemaker.

606
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,108
It really is
a truly international field.

607
00:53:19,152 --> 00:53:21,546
They all idolize
and look up to Eliud.

608
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:25,289
I think they look at this as a
chance to be a part of history today.

609
00:53:25,332 --> 00:53:27,508
It's a beautiful opportunity
to help someone

610
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:30,468
that we know can
transcend our sport.

611
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:34,646
You know, running is the
most natural sport in the world.

612
00:53:34,689 --> 00:53:37,344
You grow up, you walk, you run.

613
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:40,391
I think that's why this sport
is so beautiful.

614
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:43,220
You can run without shoes.
You don't need anything to run.

615
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,731
From an
African perspective,

616
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:19,299
right now, there are young
Africans watching,

617
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:22,998
and just looking to see
what human potential looks like,

618
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:25,305
waiting to be the next Kipchoge.

619
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:28,961
This is so inspiring, not only
to runners all over the world,

620
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:31,442
but to everybody,
that no human is limited.

621
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:33,531
You can go for your goals

622
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:35,881
if you have that energy
and that strong mind

623
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:37,404
that you do whatever
you want to do.

624
00:54:37,448 --> 00:54:39,058
So it's not about running.

625
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:40,973
It is about inspiring the world

626
00:54:41,016 --> 00:54:43,802
everybody else in the world
that everything is possible.

627
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:46,108
And nothing is limited for you.

628
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:54,291
We are approaching the
first of the roundabouts here.

629
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:57,859
This is the Lusthaus. This is the
smaller of the two roundabouts.

630
00:54:57,903 --> 00:55:01,298
In the middle of that
is a former hunting lodge.

631
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:10,437
The turn radius around
the Lusthaus on average

632
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:12,874
is about 27.4 meters.

633
00:55:13,658 --> 00:55:17,270
Originally, when we came here,
the surface was pretty old.

634
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,272
We knew that we were
going to resurface.

635
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:23,232
When you're running
at 5.861 meters per second

636
00:55:23,276 --> 00:55:26,410
at a 27.4-meter radius

637
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:31,632
you would, optimally, be looking
for about a ten-degree banking.

638
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:35,419
In a real-world condition, we
can't create a ten-degree banking,

639
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:38,683
but we can do something
to improve the current situation

640
00:55:38,726 --> 00:55:42,730
of there being a negative two percent
of a camber going away from Eliud.

641
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:47,039
If you think of a track
athlete who runs indoors

642
00:55:47,082 --> 00:55:50,303
you run on a 200
-meter banked track.

643
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,306
Now, if you're going fast,
if it was flat at 200 meters,

644
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,003
you're going to drift
towards the outside.

645
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:59,878
You're allowed to
step off the lines,

646
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:02,315
but you'd want
a little bit of a cushion.

647
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,919
- Yeah, I'm sure you saw me going...
- Yeah, yeah, I was, like...

648
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:08,103
It's a bit dangerous
when you arrive at such a turn,

649
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:11,019
when you run at a fast pace.

650
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:17,330
You might slip a little bit
outside or even twist your ankle.

651
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,464
They have actually raised it,

652
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:22,117
so that as you're running there,

653
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:24,424
you feel like you're running
an indoor track.

654
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:27,427
You're supported
and you're staying balanced.

655
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:31,083
It changes it from negative two
percent to a positive one percent

656
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:33,215
so we get a three
-percent difference.

657
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:38,438
We estimate that it can save him
up to three seconds per lap.

658
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:41,006
So that's 12 seconds
over the entire distance.

659
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:42,529
He won't save that time,

660
00:56:42,573 --> 00:56:45,489
because he actually won't
run quicker because of that

661
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:47,360
but he will conserve
more energy.

662
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,450
That's going to allow him to run
at the sub two-hour pace for longer.

663
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:54,976
OK, you can see
the recent splits there.

664
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,891
The 2:50 mark in green

665
00:56:56,935 --> 00:57:00,025
means that he is on schedule
for a sub two-hour marathon pace.

666
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:03,202
2:52 and 2:51 in the red,
means he's just outside.

667
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:07,815
He's been twice on target,
and twice just outside.

668
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:10,731
It just shows us, Ed,
even in these early stages,

669
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:12,472
just how challenging it is.

670
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:15,344
So, in what we call
the POC, on the day of the race,

671
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:17,651
the Performance
Operations Center,

672
00:57:17,695 --> 00:57:22,047
we had representatives from the
aerodynamics team, the pacemakers team,

673
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:27,356
the car and the laser, the timing
system, the meteorology team,

674
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,665
and myself in communication
with Valentijn on the road.

675
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,732
Any information that needed to
come from any of those specialist teams

676
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,845
to Valentijn was
done through me.

677
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,108
Communication
taking place

678
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:43,547
with Valentijn on the bicycle.
He's giving instructions out.

679
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:46,201
I mean, it looks like one
smooth event, doesn't it?

680
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:50,075
But it's a million
miles from that, you know.

681
00:57:50,902 --> 00:57:53,470
We had some interesting
situations in the race

682
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:57,125
where even the second kilometer,
we thought was out.

683
00:57:57,169 --> 00:58:00,520
There were some kilometers that
were 2:48 and some that were 2 :52.

684
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:04,524
2:48! That's like...
They've gone out too fast.

685
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:07,222
That's the correction
from the 2km board. Over.

686
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:09,398
This is a major issue.

687
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,357
In our little
Mission Control pod,

688
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,944
it might have been looking like a
start to an event to everyone else.

689
00:58:13,968 --> 00:58:16,536
"Oh, they're getting going,
getting warmed up."

690
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,843
We were, like,
"Whoa, OK, there's something...

691
00:58:18,886 --> 00:58:20,366
What's going on?"

692
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:24,109
Tim Kerrison is sitting there
with his headphones on.

693
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:26,546
And he kind of nonchalantly
took one off

694
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,548
and put it on the side and said,

695
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,031
"All this timing you're seeing on
the telly, and that everyone can see,

696
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:34,598
it's wrong."

697
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:37,992
I was like, "What?"
He said, "Yeah, it's wrong.

698
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:42,170
They're on pace."
I said, "Are you sure?"

699
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:44,651
He said, "Absolutely. I'm right.

700
00:58:44,695 --> 00:58:48,263
We're going to switch to our
back-up time and do it ourselves."

701
00:58:49,395 --> 00:58:51,310
I was, like...

702
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:55,140
"OK, everybody. Forget the timing.
We're switching to back -up timing."

703
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:56,663
Two-51.

704
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:02,495
The target time
holding up pretty well.

705
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,890
We've been hovering
between eight and ten seconds

706
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:07,587
inside sub two-hour pace.

707
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:09,284
So, so far so good.

708
00:59:09,328 --> 00:59:12,505
And, Ed, the next real milestone
will be the ten-kilometer mark.

709
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,378
And sub two-hour pace
would put him at, what, 28:26.

710
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:18,555
Yeah, which is
a pretty tidy 10K!

711
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:33,918
Just out of picture is Valentijn
Trouw the athletes' manager

712
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:37,225
handing now more drinks and more
gels to Eliud if he wants them.

713
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:39,706
He does take something
on board there.

714
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,274
How much he consumes
is actually closely monitored

715
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:44,624
by his nutritionist
who will be measuring

716
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:48,628
every time that he takes something
from his water bottle and tosses it.

717
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,761
They will pick it up
and hand it off to him

718
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:53,938
so he can weigh it
and know how much he consumed.

719
00:59:53,981 --> 00:59:55,940
We had people just
there to grab that bottle

720
00:59:55,983 --> 00:59:57,332
before it got in the crowd.

721
00:59:57,376 --> 00:59:59,334
Get the bottle, get the bottle!
Right, get it in.

722
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:01,249
What's the measurement?
How much did he drink?

723
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:04,296
You feed it back in. He took
X amount of mls on that one.

724
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:06,428
OK, we need to
change the next one.

725
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:10,389
So they were modifying the
fueling strategy in-race, live.

726
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:15,786
To keep that same rhythm
for two hours...

727
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:19,528
That's a lot of things happening
in your body, your muscles.

728
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:22,531
Some muscles, especially the
hamstrings, will get very tight.

729
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:24,882
Because you're running
in the same rhythm.

730
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:27,536
Lactic acid is building up
in the muscles.

731
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:32,106
After one hour and a half, it
will be very difficult for him.

732
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:38,635
Everyone was stressed not to do
a mistake, not to make him fall.

733
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,593
That was the worst
that could happen.

734
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,902
And when it was my turn,
of course, I was stressed,

735
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:48,296
but I was so happy to be here
to help Eliud.

736
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:51,691
I think I am getting the mindset
of the Kenyans.

737
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:55,608
Believing that everything is
possible by just training every day

738
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,436
for months and months,
years and years.

739
01:00:57,479 --> 01:01:01,135
When you go to race, you have
this self-belief that you can win.

740
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:06,750
I was more keen on
the body language

741
01:01:06,793 --> 01:01:09,361
as the race progressed
because they never fell back.

742
01:01:09,404 --> 01:01:12,016
But, as far as making the right
times were concerned,

743
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,148
they were being
guided by the laser.

744
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,982
Some people have criticized,
or maybe had a view about,

745
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:23,549
the role of the lead car, there.

746
01:01:23,592 --> 01:01:26,204
We can see perhaps that that's
adding extra protection,

747
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:29,642
but, essentially, as far as the
experts have explained to us,

748
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:34,255
the only reason that car is
there is to project the laser pacer.

749
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:37,258
If you talked to Robby Ketchell
who designed the aerodynamics

750
01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:39,870
he said, "If it were up to me,
I wouldn't have a car."

751
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:41,915
It doesn't seem like
that would be right

752
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:44,918
but all the computational flow
dynamics that they have been doing

753
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:48,008
have told them that the best
results would be without a car.

754
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:52,621
The car, obviously, had the
laser which set the pace-line

755
01:01:52,665 --> 01:01:54,667
so they knew exactly
at what pace to run.

756
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,889
And it also had the lines to help
them stay in the corridor, if you like.

757
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,414
The reason that it's
15 meters in front of Eliud

758
01:02:02,457 --> 01:02:05,156
is in order to throw the laser
at a significant distance.

759
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:09,377
Plus, in order to maintain the
pace precisely.

760
01:02:09,421 --> 01:02:11,075
It doesn't help the runners
behind Eliud

761
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:13,381
and it doesn't help
Eliud's position,

762
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:15,545
but it helps those five guys
directly in front of him.

763
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:27,221
Let's just home in
here on Eliud Kipchoge.

764
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:29,876
This is a great shot for us
to see the cadence,

765
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,792
and the way the rhythm,
the natural rhythm...

766
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:35,012
From memory, correct me,
both of you, if I'm wrong,

767
01:02:35,055 --> 01:02:38,276
but I don't think we've had
a kilometer outside 2:52.

768
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,887
I think that's the slowest we've had.
- Correct.

769
01:02:41,366 --> 01:02:42,976
That's incredible.

770
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,500
If you really think about it,
that is incredible pacing!

771
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:50,941
Eliud has trained
himself incredibly well

772
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:53,204
to keep the same
rhythm for two hours.

773
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:59,210
And the rhythm of all those
different athletes is like a drum

774
01:02:59,253 --> 01:03:00,515
hammering on the streets.

775
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,691
It reminds me of
that same feeling

776
01:03:02,735 --> 01:03:05,564
of them running in the long runs
in Kenya.

777
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:08,306
A kind of silence where you
only hear the steps going on.

778
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:12,136
For me, ja,
it sounds to me like music.

779
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:22,407
There are people who are
a little bit cynical about this

780
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:24,472
and saying "Well, it's not
an official world record,

781
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:28,021
and there's so much technology, so
much science, why should we care?"

782
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:30,241
There is
something artificial about this

783
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:34,375
but that's because they want to see one
guy do what no one else has done before.

784
01:03:34,419 --> 01:03:37,074
It would be incredibly hard
to achieve this in an open race.

785
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:39,119
And so, I think there is room
in the sport

786
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:41,948
for both events like this,
and also, like, open races.

787
01:03:41,992 --> 01:03:44,516
London Marathon is fantastic,
and this is fantastic.

788
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,258
Obviously, we know
technology goes into sportswear

789
01:03:47,301 --> 01:03:48,955
and has done for
a very long time,

790
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:52,132
but we shouldn't underestimate
what's going on on his feet,

791
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:54,613
and how important they are,
those trainers.

792
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:56,571
I don't think
we should kid ourselves.

793
01:03:56,615 --> 01:03:59,246
I don't think it would've been
possible to try to go under two hours

794
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,272
five or ten years ago.

795
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:05,580
The technology has developed so
fast and he's in the latest innovation.

796
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:09,628
He's in shoes that no one else
has ever run before.

797
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:12,283
It's a step change from where we
were even two years ago.

798
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:15,677
So, we're talking about, maybe,
a few seconds

799
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,767
which in this context
is an enormous amount of help.

800
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:20,726
It could be vital.

801
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:23,120
World athletics are
reportedly getting ready to ban

802
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:27,428
Nike's Vaporfly shoes for giving
runners an unfair advantage.

803
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,779
The introduction of the Vaporfly
to the running community

804
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:33,870
really has changed what we think
of as possible.

805
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:38,526
In very simplistic terms, it's
almost like a mini pogo stick.

806
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,442
You put the shoe on and you're
immediately aware that it's different.

807
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:43,923
Nike Sports research labs
are working with Kipchoge

808
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:47,535
on enhancing his shoes
to break that two-hour mark.

809
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:49,929
But I guess the big
question comes down to,

810
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:54,586
if you're not wearing the Nike
Vaporfly, can you compete?

811
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:58,677
These shoes certainly are
game-changing and transformative.

812
01:05:02,507 --> 01:05:06,728
The athletes typically are
sponsored, always sponsored,

813
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:08,730
by only the shoe industry.

814
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:11,864
So that industry
controls the sport.

815
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:16,042
Some of the biggest sponsors of
our sport are the shoe companies.

816
01:05:16,086 --> 01:05:20,481
We don't really want to be telling
them what they can and can't do.

817
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:24,572
But there are obviously things
that we would be concerned about

818
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:30,187
if that technology started
to become the predominant story.

819
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,712
I think the research right
now shows actual innovation

820
01:05:33,755 --> 01:05:35,844
that blurs the line
of enhancement.

821
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:37,368
It
enhances performance

822
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:39,544
because it's such
a technological sneaker.

823
01:05:39,587 --> 01:05:42,286
The properties
of the carbon fiber plate and...

824
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:51,556
No society, no market
economy, has ever prospered

825
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,080
by trying to stifle innovation.

826
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:56,735
I think, whether
we like it or not,

827
01:05:56,778 --> 01:05:59,956
technology comes into a lot of
sports these days.

828
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:03,568
I mean, look at cycling. The
advances we've made in the bicycle.

829
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:06,484
Does that take anything away
from Egan Bernal

830
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:08,790
or Geraint Thomas when they win
the Tour de France?

831
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:10,836
They still need to ride it.

832
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:13,882
The world of sport
needs to consider

833
01:06:13,926 --> 01:06:16,885
that the effects of
technological doping

834
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:20,715
are vastly superior
than traditional doping.

835
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:22,500
So, therefore, you
and I, the public,

836
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:37,428
can no longer gauge
what you're watching.

837
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:46,263
can no longer gauge
what you're watching.

838
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:50,093
For anybody who says this isn't
right, put the shoes on yourself.

839
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:53,009
Wear the same kit,
get yourself down to Vienna,

840
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:55,852
get a couple of people to run in
front of you, and see how fast you go.

841
01:07:02,496 --> 01:07:04,281
Well, this is the sixth of nine
teams.

842
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:07,197
There are nine
rotations, if you like.

843
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,678
And, there we are, Eric Kiptanui,
who is having a busy old morning.

844
01:07:10,722 --> 01:07:12,506
He's back on as
the team captain.

845
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,073
I tell you, that guy is in
shape!

846
01:07:16,684 --> 01:07:18,947
Technology has a place,
and it helps.

847
01:07:18,991 --> 01:07:21,428
But, at the end, it
is the human being.

848
01:07:21,907 --> 01:07:25,432
And I think that's what I find
really amazing with Eliud.

849
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:30,176
At the end of the day, it is him.
And he knows what really drives him

850
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,700
and it isn't the technology
that will drive him.

851
01:07:41,883 --> 01:07:45,191
Sub two hours has everything to
do with the changing of times,

852
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:48,194
changing of history,
changing of sports in general.

853
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:52,416
But what remains, there is a guy
a fantastic athlete, Eliud Kipchoge,

854
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:54,287
who is running 42 kilometers.

855
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:56,289
Yes, there is some
science involved

856
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,726
but it's still a person
that has to do this.

857
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:19,182
I think Eliud did not land
from another planet.

858
01:08:19,225 --> 01:08:22,489
We know what he has done,
we know his potential.

859
01:08:22,533 --> 01:08:24,535
He ran a world record in Berlin.

860
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:30,584
And I think the opinions of
people should be reflected in reality

861
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:33,674
of exactly the journey
he has come through.

862
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:49,168
I think there was a slight trip.

863
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:50,865
- Was there a trip?
- Yes.

864
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:54,130
I just saw Eliud have a little
trip-up in that transition.

865
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:03,922
12K to go, then.

866
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:06,925
This is where the critical stage
of the race starts.

867
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:10,711
We can make some comparisons
with how he was going in Monza.

868
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:14,411
Actually, up to halfway,
he was inside sub two-hour pace.

869
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:17,370
And at halfway exactly,
he was three seconds inside

870
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:20,373
and then at 25K,
he was still two seconds inside.

871
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:24,290
Even at 30K, he was only two
seconds outside sub two-hour pace.

872
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:27,989
And he admitted afterwards
that it was in the final 10K

873
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:29,687
when he really
started to feel it.

874
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:32,211
Literally no human
has tried to attempt this.

875
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,300
There's a lot of unknowns
physiologically

876
01:09:34,344 --> 01:09:36,259
as to what Eliud can handle.

877
01:09:39,262 --> 01:09:41,220
He's putting
himself through something

878
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:44,354
really, really extraordinary
here, and he will be emotional.

879
01:09:44,397 --> 01:09:48,488
Thoughts bubble up. Thoughts
you think you suppressed.

880
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:51,491
Bad demons sit on one shoulder
and good angels sit on the other.

881
01:09:52,144 --> 01:09:54,146
The way you think about pain,

882
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,148
is the way your life will be.

883
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,257
In this world, you need to undergo
pain in order to be successful.

884
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:00,892
If you understand
how marathon is,

885
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:03,503
at the apex of the pain,
that's where success is.

886
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,421
In training, he has
visualized these tough moments

887
01:10:08,465 --> 01:10:12,382
and he's pushed through in training
and said, "This is the crucial moment.

888
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:15,254
This is when you have to execute
and push through the pain."

889
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:17,735
So, he has practiced
this over and over.

890
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:23,262
We've just detected the
slightest smile-stroke- grimace

891
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:25,133
on the face of Eliud Kipchoge.

892
01:10:25,177 --> 01:10:26,874
When the smile appears, Shalane,

893
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:29,442
that normally suggests
that he's hurting.

894
01:10:29,486 --> 01:10:33,446
Yeah, that's the classic Eliud,
when he is leaning into that hurt.

895
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:36,275
It means he's working hard.

896
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:38,190
He has to be thinking right now,

897
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,540
and I'm sure this is a version
of what he's thinking,

898
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:41,976
"If not now, when?"

899
01:11:09,221 --> 01:11:12,006
He looked like
he came through that moment.

900
01:11:12,485 --> 01:11:15,793
In the mission control, it was,
like...

901
01:11:15,836 --> 01:11:18,926
This is on.
This is on now. This is coming!

902
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,494
And it was exciting, like, "Oh!"

903
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:24,280
It's just those moments,
what you live for in sport!

904
01:11:24,758 --> 01:11:28,022
One and a half hours about
to click round on the clock.

905
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:31,635
We have just under 30 minutes
to try and get Eliud Kipchoge

906
01:11:31,678 --> 01:11:34,246
into the history books,
here in Vienna.

907
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:36,335
And I can't stress enough,

908
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:39,860
the crowd out on the course
is absolutely phenomenal.

909
01:12:13,894 --> 01:12:16,375
He gives energy
and he gets energy back.

910
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:18,638
And that is a wonderful
place to be in.

911
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:24,427
We Kenyans are very good
as a cheer squad.

912
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,082
It's all about the
support at the back

913
01:12:28,126 --> 01:12:30,520
that comes out shining
to the whole world.

914
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:51,802
He has trained himself
incredibly well for what is going on

915
01:12:51,845 --> 01:12:56,328
and what he takes in, and what he
shuts down from the outside world.

916
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:21,397
Here we go,
this is team number eight.

917
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:27,098
Wow. I think we just need to take a
pause, don't we, and just breathe?

918
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,760
I feel very nervous right now.

919
01:13:36,803 --> 01:13:39,240
Because anyone
who has ever run a marathon

920
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:41,329
will know that the
last few miles,

921
01:13:41,373 --> 01:13:43,680
anything can happen,
and the wheels can come off.

922
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:47,727
He looks really good. You're
just hoping that he's got this.

923
01:13:59,696 --> 01:14:03,134
Here are the final team of
pacemakers, team number nine.

924
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:07,486
They will take them home from 38
kilometers right through to the finish.

925
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,663
And the captain, of course, he
was the captain in the first team.

926
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:12,230
It's Bernard Lagat.

927
01:14:13,623 --> 01:14:17,496
There he is, itching to go,
Bernard Lagat.

928
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:21,631
And how fitting that the 44 -year-old,
the oldest pacemaker in the team,

929
01:14:21,674 --> 01:14:24,285
the most experienced and
a dear, dear friend of Eliud,

930
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:26,505
should be the captain
on the final leg.

931
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:28,594
We're on the verge of history
here, folks.

932
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:42,216
We don't know what the
limits of human performance are.

933
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:45,306
There are people who
think they do know

934
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,135
and remarkable humans,
and teams of humans,

935
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:50,050
keep proving them wrong.

936
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:52,966
Our own individual performances

937
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:57,536
are nearly always linked to a
collective performance somewhere.

938
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:00,757
And I think for all of us,
in all walks of life, in fact,

939
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,454
we're stronger together.

940
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:08,068
It goes so much further than
running. So much further than sport.

941
01:15:08,112 --> 01:15:09,983
It goes to show

942
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:13,552
that the preconceived limits that
everyone has on everything in life,

943
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,467
can be challenged.
It's incredible.

944
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:32,092
That line,
"No human is limited,"

945
01:15:32,136 --> 01:15:34,312
I would impart it on any girl.

946
01:15:34,355 --> 01:15:37,445
That no matter your gender, no
matter where you're born from,

947
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:39,099
you are not limited.

948
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:41,841
You are supposed to actualize
your dreams and your passion.

949
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,759
It means that you
should always work hard,

950
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:48,456
no matter what.

951
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,548
Not listening to negativity,
but listening to positive minds.

952
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:59,598
In most circumstances,
you and me limit ourselves.

953
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:02,819
It is not other people who limit
us. It is us who limit ourselves.

954
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:05,604
And I do believe the moment
we get over that hurdle,

955
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:08,999
then you have the whole world
outside there open for you to conquer.

956
01:16:25,624 --> 01:16:29,802
I think the concept is spreading
in all sectors of our society.

957
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:33,806
It is a momentum that is,
to me, positive.

958
01:16:34,546 --> 01:16:40,117
You meet teachers from different
schools that, when preparing students,

959
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,294
they are quoting
the "No human is limited" story.

960
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:45,688
And we can see
lives being changed.

961
01:16:51,345 --> 01:16:53,347
I don't know about
you guys, but my heart,

962
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:55,393
I can feel it pounding in my
shirt this morning.

963
01:16:56,786 --> 01:16:59,876
It's 500 meters to go,
he is almost there.

964
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:04,489
He has one hand on history
here in Vienna.

965
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:08,362
There was an
agreement, that if he felt good,

966
01:17:08,406 --> 01:17:11,670
he was gonna tell Valentijn
and the other guys would peel off.

967
01:17:11,714 --> 01:17:16,588
And, sure enough, Valentijn gets
the nod and they pulled off. Oh!

968
01:17:17,589 --> 01:17:19,112
What a wonderful moment!

969
01:17:19,156 --> 01:17:22,072
What an absolutely
brilliant moment.

970
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:26,337
Three hundred meters to
go, let's bring him home.

971
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,295
He's pointing.
"Come on!" he says.

972
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:32,604
Eliud Kipchoge has the hand of
history on his shoulder.

973
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:37,565
Neil Armstrong
we had on the moon in 1969.

974
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:41,787
We had Roger Bannister and
the four-minute mile 65 years ago.

975
01:17:41,831 --> 01:17:46,618
Edmund Hillary, the first
man to climb Everest, in 1953.

976
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,360
Eliud Kipchoge is
on his way here.

977
01:20:16,637 --> 01:20:18,857
It's overwhelming,
you know? It's a big deal.

978
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:21,077
People talk about these things,
they look at it.

979
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,774
"A guy ran a marathon."

980
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,603
He's the first bloke ever,
ever in the human race,

981
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:26,952
in human history, to do that.

982
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,389
And you think, "Oh, God."

983
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:31,827
And in a crazy little way
you've supported that, you know?

984
01:20:32,566 --> 01:20:34,873
And it means a lot. It
means a lot to a lot of people.

985
01:20:34,917 --> 01:20:36,832
It means a lot to me.
