me run

00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:46,918
The set-up we have in Kaptagat

168
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,443
is an ideal environment
where somebody

169
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:53,186
can have around them the right
people to give them moral
support.

170
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:59,192
CHOGE: Eliud has really helped
young people, and some of us

171
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:03,022
because what you see from him
makes you believe

172
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,416
that if this person can do this,
also I can do that.

173
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,854
He is a mentor
to so many young athletes.

174
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,814
Squat! Get into the
squatting position.

175
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,338

NJOROGE: People look up to him

180
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,014
because he's not trying to be
something else.

181
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,756
He's completely sincere.

182
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,544
MAN: The camp is a
really special place.

183
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:51,548
The athletes organize everything
in camp themselves.

184
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,160
NJOROGE: It is very austere.

185
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:59,774
But I think you then get
connected with what really
matters.

186
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:04,779
You can get with very little.
All the other things are fluff.

CHOGE: There are so many things
that I've learned from him.

189
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:17,096
One of them is
really... be humble.

190
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,404
No matter what success you
achieve in your life, always be
humble.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

192
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:30,457
In his case, humility is
something that's absolutely
core.

193
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,241
He doesn't even think about it.

194
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,549
It's a natural thing
that emanates out from him,
really.

195
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:38,073
It's central to the way
that he operates.

fitness, we believe in the team

that we have selected
to help Eliud.

202
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:31,822
We believe in the coaching
that's been provided for us.

203
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,737
So we have a strong team.

all you can do is just

206
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,484
train, eat, rest, and repeat.

NDUHIU: High-altitude training
does them a lot of good.

211
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:26,328
You develop a higher
