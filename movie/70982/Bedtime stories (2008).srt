1
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,785
[Man] I'm going
to tell you a story now.

2
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,371
But as any good storyteller knows,

3
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,042
one must first be sure
the audience is prepared.

4
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,502
Is everybody comfortably seated?

5
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,838
Does anyone need to use the bathroom?

6
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,008
Oh. You, sir, in the back?

7
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,968
Well, hold it in.

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,262
[Laughs]

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,973
You ready? Here we go.

10
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,812
My name is Marty Bronson.

11
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,858
I owned and operated
the Sunny Vista Motel,

12
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:11,570
which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards

13
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:16,700
in Los Angeles, California,
in the year 1974.

14
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,329
The motel was my labor of love,

15
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,207
and I ran it with the help
of my children: Wendy...

16
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,503
[Marty] Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. And Mrs. Dixon.

17
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,838
Thank you.

18
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,006
And Skeeter.

19
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,595
May I help you with your bags,
Mr. And Mrs. Dixon?

20
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,139
- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.

21
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,435
[Grunting]

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,020
You, uh, need a hand?

23
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,855
No, no. I got it.

24
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,274
[Mr. Dixon] OK.

25
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,863
To my boy Skeeter,
the motel was a wonderland.

26
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,573
Way too hyper.

27
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,201
The galaxy's not big enough
for the both of us.

28
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,786
A magical place.

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,831
[Chatter, laughter]

30
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,334
Full of new adventures
for a six-year-old boy.

31
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,005
[Laughs] Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

32
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,387
Skeeter loved the old place
as much as I did.

33
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,890
And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better.

34
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,269
I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.

35
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:29,189
I was thinking we could put
an extra pair of socks in each room

36
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,985
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

37
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,487
That's a good idea.

38
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,948
Time for bed,
I'm meeting with Mr. Nottingham.

39
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,617
Wait, Dad. I'm not even tired.

40
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,079
Well, how about a bedtime story?

41
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,497
Yay!

42
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:53,172
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

43
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,883
and that little boy's name
was Skeeter.

44
00:02:55,925 --> 00:03:00,679
Well, I could tell a pretty fair tale
when the muse was with me.

45
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,056
And making my little boy smile,

46
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,559
now, that was truly magical.

47
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:10,564
Yeah, I was a pretty good dad
and a pretty good host.

48
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,985
But unfortunately,
a pretty bad businessman.

49
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,946
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

50
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,490
This motel is sinking in red ink...

51
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,868
and I'm offering you the last lifeboat.

52
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,870
[Sighs]

53
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,455
I don't know.

54
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,665
[Nottingham]
I've seen the books, Martin.

55
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,919
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

56
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,795
Yes, well, I...

57
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,049
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

58
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,800
[Nottingham] How about this?

59
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,137
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

60
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,223
I'll let him run this place.

61
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,934
[Sighs] You promise?

62
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,270
Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.

63
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,904
That's my boy, Bronson.

64
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:03,659
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

65
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,663
It's going to be uptight
and out of sight.

66
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:12,501
[Marty] And just like that,
our modest little Sunny Vista Motel...

67
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:17,339
...metamorphosized into the
mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.

68
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,841
And for the past 25 years,

69
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,345
it has been lovingly maintained
by my now grown-up son,

70
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,223
Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.

71
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,601
Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's promise
for Skeeter to run the place

72
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,187
- seems to have been forgotten...
- Hiya, Pop.

73
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,857
...my boy always works diligently
with a hopeful heart,

74
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,818
still waiting for his shot.

75
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,737
Mrs. Dixon?
Is there a problem with her room?

76
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,532
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

77
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,202
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

78
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,578
and doesn't want to pay for it.

79
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,665
I never even touched
that evil little refrigerator.

80
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,625
I don't drink alcohol.

81
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,627
Of course.
There's probably a mix-up.

82
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,046
- I saw who took it.
- OK.

83
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,257
He had red hair and a beard.

84
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,843
He was wearing a green suit
with brass buttons.

85
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,345
And he stands about ten inches tall.

86
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,015
So we're talking about a leprechaun?

87
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,099
There you go.

88
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,643
Oh, I didn't know your brother
was in town.

89
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,937
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

90
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,441
Put all the missing bottles
on my tab.

91
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,235
Next time you see any leprechauns,
we'll tell Aspen.

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,403
She's half-troll.

93
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,905
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,657
[Scoffs]

95
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,992
She would.

96
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,122
[Marty] Today magic is
in the air at the grand hotel,

97
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,750
and the winds of change
are about to blow our story

98
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,085
in a strange new direction.

99
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,087
But what would you expect in a hotel

100
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,132
founded by someone who loved
a good story as much as I?

101
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,509
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.

102
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,305
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

103
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,723
Of course.

104
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,768
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.

105
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,145
- [Feedback]
- Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

106
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,231
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

107
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,900
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.

108
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,027
I say "Barry,"
you say "Nottingham."

109
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,447
- Barry.
- [All] Nottingham.

110
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,657
♪ Barry had a Nottingham

111
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,993
♪ Nottingham, Nottingham

112
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,787
♪ Barry had a Nottingham

113
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,539
♪ Whose beard was
white as snow ♪

114
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,459
[laughs] Come on,
give it up for the big man.

115
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,877
[Applause]

116
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,462
Got them warmed up for you, sir.

117
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,923
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.

118
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,007
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,

119
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,218
Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...

120
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,636
Not a fear, an awareness...

121
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,305
...of germs and
how dangerous they can be

122
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,725
when not properly... feared, so...

123
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,186
You're doing the right thing.
I didn't shower today.

124
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,021
So, yeah, let me get out of here.

125
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,774
[Skeeter] Barry Nottingham, everybody.

126
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,363
- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- [Barry] Welcome.

127
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:51,410
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

128
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,537
But it's no secret that this one,

129
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,832
the Sunny Vista Nottingham,
is my favorite.

130
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,839
However, this is a 20th-century hotel.

131
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,092
We need something for the 21st century.

132
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,554
And so, we have decided
to close this hotel

133
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:15,684
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

134
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,353
[Applause]

135
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,815
This will be the largest hotel
on the West Coast.

136
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,485
I simply don't understand what the fuss
is about. It's just a big building.

137
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,321
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

138
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,033
...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

139
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,662
Yes!

140
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:40,625
So I'm proud to announce
the new hotel's general manager.

141
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,753
He's been waiting on this
for a long time.

142
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,966
We all know how hard he works,
how intelligent he is,

143
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,469
how much this hotel means to him.

144
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,638
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!

145
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,974
Take a bow, Kendall.

146
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,269
- God bless.
- Boo!

147
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,770
[Hissing]

148
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,523
[Man] A beautiful speech, sir.
A beautiful speech.

149
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,567
I'm so glad you could come.

150
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,444
It's great to see you.

151
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,945
Don't touch me.

152
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,363
Well done, Daddy.

153
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,660
Oh, oh, hello there.
Do you know my daughter, Violet?

154
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,662
Only by reputation, sir.

155
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,414
Excuse me?

156
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,292
No, no, not that she has a reputation.

157
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,835
I always heard she's very hot.

158
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,463

You could fit into one spot.

all the way down the block.

Well, next time park in that box.
Plenty of room in there.

Anyway, here's the situation.

they take it out of my salary.

- [Jill] Where are you? Still there?

312
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,746
I'm still where?
Who's this?

313
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,832
Look, I've got to get to class.
The kids are waiting for you, OK?

314
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,001
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,837
[Stammers] I forgot.
I'll be there in like 20 minutes.

316
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,005
[Phone beeps off]

317
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,175
I'm gonna baby-sit
my nephew and niece tonight.

318
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,845
Oh, God.
Got any advice for me?

319
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,514
Yes, I do. Sometimes I baby-sit
my cousins, right?

320
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,850
And what I do is
I let them style me hair.

321
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,145
Like put beads into it and braid it,
make me look all real sexy.

322
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,398
Like Milli Vanilli, stuff like that.
You should try that.

323
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,360
Braid my hair? That's a good idea.
Can I have some French fries?

324
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,071
Of course you can.
You're my best friend.

325
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,822
[Gasps]

326
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,450
Ah! Actually, I really like
ketchup on my face

327
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,452
because it's
rejuvenating for the skin.

328
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,038
So who's the real victim?
You are.

329
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,749
Mmm! Delicious.

330
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,713
Do you think these signs will help?

331
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,216
Well, miracles happen,
you know?

332
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,426
You mean like Dad coming back?

333
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,844
Um...

334
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,264
- [door closes]
- [Skeeter singing]

335
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,935
[Laughing] Hey!
Sorry I'm late.

336
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,937
So, um, their pajamas
are on their beds,

337
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,565
and I will be back, um,
at 8:30 to pick them up, OK?

338
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,402
- All right.
- Here is my cell phone number.

339
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,029
And call me if there's
any emergencies.

340
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,907
All right. Have fun at night school.

341
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,993
- [Jill] Bye, guys.
- Bye.

342
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,245
All packed up here.

343
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,665
I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.

344
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,127
Some clean underwear.

345
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,296
Well, maybe not that clean.

346
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,800
You guys want to watch TV?

347
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,760
We don't have a TV.

348
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,012
[Cell phone rings]

349
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,097
- Hello?
- [Skeeter] Emergency!

350
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,392
They don't have a TV.

351
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,894
Wendy doesn't let them watch TV.
You didn't know?

352
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,938
I don't know a lot of things
about these kids.

353
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,733
I wasn't allowed over here.
Their old man didn't like me.

354
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,902
OK, listen, you don't need a TV.
You can, um, play a game, do a puzzle.

355
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,238
I'm sure you can figure
something out. OK?

356
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,116
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let them
braid my hair or something?

357
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,784
Would they like that?

358
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,120
I don't think anyone
should touch that hair.

359
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,335
Hey, what do you say we go...

360
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,839
next door and toilet paper
your neighbor's trees?

361
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,801
No? OK, bedtime!

362
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,555
[Thunder, rain falling]

363
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,606
OK, so you guys cool?

364
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,150
You have to read us a bedtime story.

365
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,611
Yeah, all right. You have any?

366
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:57,408
Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?

367
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,536
"Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"?

368
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,789
Mmm, no.

369
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,209
"The Organic Squirrel
Gets a Bike Helmet"?

370
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,836
I'm not reading these
communist books to you guys.

371
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,421
Don't you got any real stories?

372
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,799
- Like what?
- Like what?

373
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,301
Like, like cowboys? Or dragons?

374
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,596
Or aliens? Or... What the heck
is on my head right now?

375
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,808
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.

376
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,811
- Why do you call him Bugsy?
- Because of his eyes.

377
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,604
Let me see them.

378
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,689
[Squeaking]

379
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,486
Wow! Those eyes would be big on a cow.

380
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,404
[Squeaking]

381
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,782
Are those eyeballs
or bowling balls?

382
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,826
Can't keep my eyes off of them.

383
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,496
Just get in there so I don't have to
look at them anymore. Goodbye.

384
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,206
Anyways, uh,

385
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,042
you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?

386
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,044
Like, like my old man used to do for me?

387
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,629
Maybe I could be good at this.

388
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,134
All right, um...

389
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,385
Here goes.

390
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:02,682
Once upon a time,
in a magical, faraway kingdom...

391
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,436
...there was a brave
and noble knight.

392
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,439
Strikingly handsome.

393
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,316
Who lived in a grand castle

394
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:17,905
that weary travelers from near and far
would come and visit.

395
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,993
Now, this knight had been
working his butt offfor years.

396
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,871
You'd think he'd be a shoo-in
to rule the castle, right?

397
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,039
- [Patrick] Right.
- [Skeeter] Wrong.

398
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:32,086
Actually, he wasn't
even a knight at all.

399
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,421
[Neighs]

400
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,381
Oh, no.

401
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,720
[Skeeter] He was, in fact,
just a lowly peasant.

402
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,015
And even though he was the son
ofthe late, great Lord Marty...

403
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,766
- [indistinct]
- Thank you.

404
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,937
...and knew everything there is
to know about running a castle,

405
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,940
everyone just took him for granted.

406
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,069
His name was Mr. Underappreciated.

407
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,071
What's "underdemeciated"?

408
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,908
- Under de-what?
- Underdemeciated.

409
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,202
That's right,
I forgot you were six.

410
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,580
His name was Sir... Fix-A-Lot.

411
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,625
But alas, the kingdom
where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived

412
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,837
did not place much value on dedication
or hard work, I guess.

413
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:20,468
Because the superstar in all
the land was Sir Butt-Kiss.

414
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,388
And he spent all his days
kissing everybody's butt.

415
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,224
[Kissing sounds]

416
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,100
- Boo!
- [Giggles]

417
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,645
And my lord, yes,
of course I can get you

418
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,940
front row house seats
to The Lion King. [laughs]

419
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,817
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had
a best friend, Friar Fred,

420
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,819
who was not right in the head.

421
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,282
She never! No! Not our queen,
I won't have that.

422
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:47,078
- Were there any kids in the kingdom?
- [Skeeter] Yes, yes. Of course.

423
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,122
There were two young pages.

424
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,751
Mistress Stinky
and Master Smelly.

425
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,671
Hey-oh! And don't forget...

426
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,173
Jillian! The queen of the fairies!

427
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,008
[Skeeter] Queen of the fairies?

428
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,345
I mean, if she has to be there,
let'sjust make her an angry raven.

429
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,556
[Caws]

430
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,059
Parking spot!

431
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,395
[Patrick] She should be
a mermaid teacher.

432
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,022
[Bobbi] Yeah. The best
mermaid teacher in the world.

433
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,733
Children, open your books to page 16.

434
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,235
Yes, Miss Mermaid.

435
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,569
Let's begin.

436
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,905
All right, she's a mermaid.
Whatever you want.

437
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,448
Anyways, back to the story.

438
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,703
One day the king invited
all his subjects to the castle.

439
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,579
I bring glad tidings.

440
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,207
For on this day
I have chosen a champion

441
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,376
who will run this castle

442
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,839
and be my closest advisor
and bestest buddy.

443
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,633
My new champion is...

444
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,051
...Sir Butt-Kiss!

445
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,178
[Cheers, applause]

446
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,604
Thank you.

447
00:21:55,689 --> 00:22:00,026
Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot had been passed over.

448
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:04,405
So, Sir Fix-A-Lot
moved into a giant shoe,

449
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,992
got a bad case of athlete's face,

450
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,243
dove into a moat...

451
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,287
Ah, what the heck.
[Shouts]

452
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,080
...and got eaten by crocodiles.

453
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,915
[Shouting]

454
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,417
The end.

455
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,754
The end? That can't be the end.

456
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,089
- Why? Why not?
- It's not happy.

457
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,718
There aren't happy endings in real life.
Sooner you know that, the better.

458
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,512
- It's not fair!
- What? What's not fair?

459
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,641
I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at least get a shot to be champion?

460
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,103
- A shot? Hmm...
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better

461
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,148
than Sir Butt-Kiss, he should
get a chance to prove it.

462
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,650
OK. Yeah, yeah,
Bobbi, good.

463
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,527
[Bobbi] What the king
really said was...

464
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,030
On second thought,

465
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,158
there is another worthy man
in my kingdom,

What's bacon?

00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,378
Does Skeetacus get
the girl he was after?

1088
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,921
[Bobbi] In these stories,

1089
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,507
the hero always gets the fairest
maiden in the land.

1090
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,051
Yes! You said it!
OK, so it's gonna happen!

1091
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,221
Uh, right. So, what? They're thirsty?
They go off for drinks?

1092
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,724
A little wine and cheese action? Yes?

1093
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:16,812
[Bobbi] Yeah, they can go to an old
tavern. And guess who's there?

1094
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,814
Led Zeppelin.
Say Led Zeppelin, please.

1095
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:22,776
No. All the girls that were mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1096
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,154
What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1097
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,072
He was like
the coolest guy in school.

1098
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,074
That's not what Mom said.

1099
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,160
All right, everybody was
mean to Skeetacus.

1100
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,996
He had problems.
All right, tell your story.

1101
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,372
Oh, my God...

1102
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,749
[Bobbi] They see he's now with

1103
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,584
the fairest maiden in all the land,

1104
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,046
and they are reallyjealous.

1105
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,256
[Patrick] So jealous they
don't know what to do.

1106
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,176
They just start nervously
doing the hokey-pokey.

[Bobbi] So then,

1113
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,483
Skeetacus takes his date
out to the beach.

1114
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,778
[Patrick] All of a sudden,
a big hairy guy

1115
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,114
washes up onshore, passed out.

1116
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,075
[Skeeter] Why a hairy guy?
I don't get it.

1117
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,242
[Patrick] Just 'cause.

1118
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:15,496
He had something stuck in his throat,
and he wasn't breathing.

1119
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,711
- Thanks.
- He's OK.

1120
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,964
And then it starts pouring,
so they run into a magical cave.

1121
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,009
- Caves are nice.
- And Abe Lincoln's there.

1122
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,428
Abe Lincoln?
What, is this a joke to you?

1123
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,348
What the heck's the matter with you?
Oh, I'm sorry.

1124
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,641
I, I didn't mean to yell.

1125
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:38,185
The Abe Lincoln thing, that's,
that's a good idea.

1126
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:42,231
It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?

1127
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,692
Don't you think he should?
It's... been a long time for him.

1128
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:50,864
His lips are very dry
from not using them.

1129
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,574
- Bugsy, you with me?
- [Groans]

1130
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,204
We'll see.

1131
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,832
- [Violet] Hello?
- Mmm.

1132
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,543
Hey, is this the fairest maiden
in the land?

1133
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,670
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?

1134
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:08,006
Yes, it is. Sorry about that Ferrari
confusion the other night.

1135
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,510
I'm here at the beach right now
and I had a hunch you might be here too.

1136
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,345
What do you say
we get a little lunchsky?

1137
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,930
That sounds so delightful.

1138
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,016
But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.

1139
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,477
Vegas?

1140
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,896
Uh, no one talked about Vegas.

1141
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,232
Don't tell Kendall.
He thinks I'm in the library.

1142
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,651
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,

1143
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,903
I, I really thought we
were gonna hang out today.

1144
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,698
Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.

00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,782
Bye, Skeeter.

Hmm.

So our date's gonna be tomorrow?
I can live with that.

- Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!

1150
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,674
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?

1151
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,260
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

1152

I'm supposed to be
looking for a job now,

1153

coming to the beach today.

I'll let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,

1159
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,613
- so how was I gonna pay?
- Of course you got your wallet stolen.

- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's always something with you.

1161
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,910
- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.

1162
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,537
- Gonna wear that all day?
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat.

1163
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,290
- I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
- I'll take it back. Thanks.

- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.

- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.

shortly. And here you are.

Yeah. Wow, this is so...
weird. Uh...

We were just planning
our high school reunion.

We were totally just talking about you.
It's so weird.

Mind pretending to be
my girlfriend for a second?

Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

she likes to say.

Hey, we got to check the rooms
before we start making booms.

We've checked it already!

Do it myself.

The king has issued a proclamation.

1717
01:29:07,258 --> 01:29:09,384
The hotel moves away.

1718
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:11,845
The school will stay.

1719
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:14,139
Long live Webster Elementary!

1720
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:20,645
- Mom!
- Mom!

You guys underdemeciated me.

Come here! I just got to know you guys.

1725
01:29:33,826 --> 01:29:36,286
You think I'm gonna let
you slip away from me now?

1726
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,997
[Bobbi] I knew you were the good guy.

1727
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:40,457
Yeah.

1728

Uh, Patrick, hi.
I'm Trisha Sparks.

1729
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:47,964
I just wanted you to know that...
thanks for saving the school.

- That's my boy. That's my boy.

1732

There must be some way for me
to show my appreciation.

Oh-ho-ho! Get it.

Hey, isn't she a little old for you?

- So is she. What do you think?

[Cheering]

1742

[Marty] Now look what my boy has done.

1743
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:43,353
Turned his back on the world
of luxury hotel management

1744
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:46,398
to start a small family business.

1745
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:50,652
And bless his heart,
he even named it after me.

1746
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:54,030
Hey, speaking of s'mores,
it looks like Bugsy ate them all.

We're completely out of marshmallows.

01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:01,371
Oh, all right. Let me handle that.
Room service!

1750
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,500
- Yes, sir?
- [Skeeter] Hi, Kendall.

1751
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,085
Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows.

1752
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,713
If you could just go get him some,
that would be great.

1753
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:11,381
Right on it, sir.
Anything else?

1754
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,550
Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh...

1755

- [bell dings]
...Housekeeping?

1756
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,263
Hey, Aspen.

1757
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:20,724
Could you just make sure
that Bugsy's cage is clean

1758
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:22,392
before he checks out in the morning?

1759
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:25,312
His marshmallows don't agree with him,
there's gonna be a mess.

1760
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:28,815
- [Farts, chitters]

1761
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,150
[Skeeter] All right.

1762
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:32,986
OK, bye, guys.

1763
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,405
[Marty] I think Bugsy
is trying to tell us

1764
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,407
that our tale has reached its end.

1765
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,242
But before I go, let me tell you

1766
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:41,703
what our heroes and villains
are doing now.

1767
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,663
My old friend, Barry Nottingham,

1768
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,291
overcame his fear of germs
to such a degree

1769
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,710
that he decided to leave
the hotel business

1770
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:51,379
and enter the field of medicine.

1771
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:55,759
He is currently the school nurse
at Webster Elementary.

1772
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:58,094
Violet now runs the hotel empire,

1773
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:00,555
along with her husband, Mickey,

1774
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:02,682
the former room service waiter

1775
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:05,602
who is now the ninth-richest
person in the world.

1776
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:08,647
And Skeeter and Jill?

1777
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:12,150
After the double wedding ofthe century,

1778
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:16,863
they lived... well, happily ever after,

1779
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,698
running Marty's Motel

1780
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:21,993
and spending a lot oftime
with my grandkids,

1781
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,829
whose adventures have just begun.

1782
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:28,959
Though, not everyone
is quite so excited.

1783
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:31,795
But that is a whole other story.

1784
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,713
The end.
