1
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,007
<i>I am going to tell
you a story now.</i>

2
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:40,564
<i>But as any good storyteller knows,</i>

3
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:44,237
<i>one must first be sure
the audience is prepared.</i>

4
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:46,712
<i>Is everybody comfortably seated?</i>

5
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:49,045
<i>Does anyone need to use the bathroom?</i>

6
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:52,211
<i>Oh. You, sir, in the back?</i>

7
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:54,187
<i>Well, hold it in.</i>

8
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,152
<i>You ready? Here we go.</i>

9
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,997
<i>My name is Marty Bronson.</i>

10
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:09,059
<i>I owned and operated
the Sunny Vista Motel,</i>

11
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:12,766
<i>which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards</i>

12
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:17,904
<i>in Los Angeles, California,
in the year 1974.</i>

13
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:21,506
<i>The motel was my labor of love,</i>

14
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:24,416
<i>and I ran it with the help
of my children: Wendy...</i>

15
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:28,684
Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.

16
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,014
Thank you.

17
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,218
<i>And Skeeter.</i>

18
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,790
May I help you with your bags,
Mr. and Mrs. Dixon?

19
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,334
- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.

20
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:46,230
You, uh, need a hand?

21
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,071
No, no. I got it.

22
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,472
OK.

23
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:56,047
<i>To my boy Skeeter,
the motel was a wonderland.</i>

24
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:57,778
Way too hyper.

25
00:01:57,778 --> 00:02:00,412
The galaxy's not big enough
for the both of us.

26
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,978
<i>A magical place.</i>

27
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:08,529
<i>Full of new adventures
for a six-year-old boy.</i>

28
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:13,193
Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

29
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,601
<i>Skeeter loved the old place
as much as I did.</i>

30
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:23,110
<i>And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better.</i>

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,477
I have got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.

32
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:30,382
I was thinking we could put
an extra pair of socks in each room

33
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:34,183
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

34
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,680
That's a good idea.

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,158
Time for bed,
I am meeting with Mr. Nottingham.

36
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,821
Wait, Dad. I am not even tired.

37
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:45,297
Well, how about a bedtime story?

38
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,698
Yay!

39
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:54,371
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

40
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,070
and that little boy's name
was Skeeter.

41
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,878
<i>Well, I could tell a pretty fair tale
when the muse was with me.</i>

42
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:04,248
<i>And making my little boy smile,</i>

43
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:06,753
<i>now, that was truly magical.</i>

44
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:11,758
<i>Yeah, I was a pretty good dad
and a pretty good host.</i>

45
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:16,195
<i>But unfortunately,
a pretty bad businessman.</i>

46
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,165
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

47
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,702
This motel is sinking in red ink...

48
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,068
and I am offering you the last lifeboat.

49
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,631
I don't know.

50
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,870
I have seen the books, Martin.

51
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,107
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

52
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:34,978
Yes, well, I...

53
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:38,246
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

54
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:39,980
How about this?

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,353
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

56
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:45,416
I will let him run this place.

57
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:48,125
You promise?

58
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,461
Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.

59
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,107
That's my boy, Bronson.

60
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,839
Trust me, I am going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

61
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:08,849
It's going to be uptight
and out of sight.

62
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,718
<i> And just like that,
our modest little Sunny Vista Motel...</i>

63
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:18,555
<i>... metamorphosized into the
mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.</i>

64
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:21,060
<i>And for the past 25 years,</i>

65
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,530
<i>it has been lovingly maintained
by my now grown-up son,</i>

66
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,432
<i>Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.</i>

67
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:30,801
<i>Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's promise
for Skeeter to run the place</i>

68
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,397
<i>- seems to have been forgotten...
- Hiya, Pop.</i>

69
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:37,070
<i>... my boy always works diligently
with a hopeful heart,</i>

70
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,010
<i>still waiting for his shot.</i>

71
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,947
Mrs. Dixon?
Is there a problem with her room?

72
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,712
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

73
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:48,381
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

74
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,787
and doesn't want to pay for it.

75
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:52,850
I never even touched
that evil little refrigerator.

76
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,827
I don't drink alcohol.

77
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,830
Of course.
There's probably a mix-up.

78
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,264
- I saw who took it.
- OK.

79
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,461
He had red hair and a beard.

80
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:04,027
He was wearing a green suit
with brass buttons.

81
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:06,539
And he stands about ten inches tall.

82
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,202
So we're talking about a leprechaun?

83
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:10,301
There you go.

84
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,846
Oh, I didn't know your brother
was in town.

85
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,144
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

86
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:18,652
Put all the missing bottles
on my tab.

87
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,450
Next time you see any leprechauns,
we will tell Aspen.

88
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,581
She's half-troll.

89
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:25,125
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

90
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:28,190
She would.

91
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:33,334
<i> Today magic is
in the air at the grand hotel,</i>

92
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,926
<i>and the winds of change
are about to blow our story</i>

93
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:38,302
<i>in a strange new direction.</i>

94
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,307
<i>But what would you expect in a hotel</i>

95
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:43,344
<i>founded by someone who loved
a good story as much as I?</i>

96
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,709
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.

97
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:49,511
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

98
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:50,915
Of course.

99
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,977
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.

100
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:56,353
Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

101
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:59,416
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

102
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,086
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.

103
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:03,221
I say "Barry,"
you say "Nottingham."

104
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,027
- Barry.
- Nottingham.

105
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:06,657
- Barry.
- Nottingham.

106
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,861
<i># Barry had a Nottingham</i>

107
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:11,201
<i># Nottingham, Nottingham</i>

108
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:13,001
<i># Barry had a Nottingham</i>

109
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:15,736
<i># Whose beard was
white as snow #</i>

110
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:18,677
Come on,
give it up for the big man.

111
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:21,672
Got them warmed up for you, sir.

112
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,115
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.

113
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,209
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,

114
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:27,413
Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...

115
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,853
Not a fear, an awareness...

116
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:31,517
...of germs and
how dangerous they can be

117
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,926
when not properly... feared, so...

118
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,396
You're doing the right thing.
I didn't shower today.

119
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,228
So, yeah, let me get out of here.

120
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,962
Barry Nottingham, everybody.

121
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:47,572
- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- Welcome.

122
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:52,602
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

123
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:54,739
But it's no secret that this one,

124
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:58,013
the Sunny Vista Nottingham,
is my favorite.

125
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:05,020
However, this is a 20th-century hotel.

126
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,290
We need something for the 21st century.

127
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,764
And so, we have decided
to close this hotel

128
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:16,861
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

129
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:23,008
This will be the largest hotel
on the West Coast.

130
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:26,672
I simply don't understand what the fuss
is about. It's just a big building.

131
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:29,512
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

132
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:33,247
...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

133
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,852
Yes!

134
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:41,827
So I am proud to announce
the new hotel's general manager.

135
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:44,956
He's been waiting on this
for a long time.

136
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:49,163
We all know how hard he works,
how intelligent he is,

137
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:51,671
how much this hotel means to him.

138
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,833
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!

139
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,176
Take a bow, Kendall.

140
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,474
- God bless.
- Boo!

141
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,712
A beautiful speech, sir.
A beautiful speech.

142
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,777
I am so glad you could come.

143
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,651
It's great to see you.

144
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,156
Don't touch me.

145
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,555
Well done, Daddy.

146
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,863
Oh, oh, hello there.
Do you know my daughter, Violet?

147
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,865
Only by reputation, sir.

148
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,628
Excuse me?

149
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:23,500
No, no, not that she has a reputation.

150
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,038
I always heard she's very hot.

151
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,670
Not hot as in hot.

152
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,710
Hot, I meant warm...
Warm-hearted.

153
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,679
And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,

154
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,979
in bars, with a lot
of different guys, and...

155
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,020
That's the old Violet Nottingham.
Before she met me.

156
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,818
Now it's up to me to keep
my pooky-bear out of the spotlight

157
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:46,485
and nightclubs and tabloids.
Isn't that right, sir?

158
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,496
Violet's off to her private tennis
lesson with Roger Federer.

159
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,226
- Oh. All right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.

160
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:54,962
Got to say, uh...

161
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:58,597
...it's going to be hard for me to see
the hotel move locations like this.

162
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:02,109
Well, I, I do hope you will feel able
to come and work with us there.

163
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,201
Big as Kendall wants to make it,

164
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:07,042
well, there's going to be a lot
of light bulbs to change.

165
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,510
Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?

166
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,076
There is, sir. Come this way.
I will get you some.

167
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,917
Can't be too careful, Kendall.

168
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,798
All right, everyone finished
at the pottery table,

169
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,392
bring their art to the kiln.

170
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:31,063
The man with the rescue donkey's
leaving in five minutes,

171
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:32,868
if you haven't gotten a ride, hurry up.

172
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:34,168
Thank you, Principal Duva.

173
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:36,710
Oh, I am not a principal
at this party. I am a mom.

174
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,307
Hey!

175
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:42,645
I notice no one's eating
the gluten-free wheatgrass cake.

176
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:46,175
Come on. Trust me,
you just got to get past the smell.

177
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,490
What? The clown died?

178
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,256
- What's in that bag?
- Oh, chocolate chip cookie.

179
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:58,457
- Food!
- Food!

180
00:09:58,457 --> 00:10:01,400
- Slow it down, slow it down.
- Hey, sissy.

181
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,530
Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled
crud to my house every time you visit?

182
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,632
What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.

183
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:11,143
What are you talking about?
It hasn't been four years.

184
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,305
You were here for
The Fourth of July barbecue

185
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,678
when you punched my husband?

186
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:17,513
Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,

187
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:19,314
but his underwear had holes in it.

188
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:22,185
I knew he'd be your ex-husband.
You should be happy.

189
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:23,621
All right. Let's not start.

190
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,283
How are the kids handling

191
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,792
the old divorce anyways?

192
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,921
They're both kind of off right now.
Bobbi's been really quiet.

193
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,488
Why don't you go say hi.
I am going to pay the donkey guy.

194
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:35,127
- Is that what stinks in here?
- No, it's the cake.

195
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,966
What did she make, donkey cake?

196
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:40,132
I smell manure.

197
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,904
Hey, you guys. Remember me?

198
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:45,376
Uncle Skeeter.

199
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:48,882
Man, you got big.
Haven't seen you in a while.

200
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,612
Happy birthday there, Bobbi.

201
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:54,154
I am Patrick. She's Bobbi.

202
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,883
Oh, my bad.

203
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:59,051
Got you a little something.
Happy birthday, Bobbi.

204
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:01,686
Here you go.
Picked it up at the hotel.

205
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:03,889
How's school going?

206
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:06,297
- Skeeter?
- Yeah.

207
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:08,892
Getting called to the principal's
office. Look at that.

208
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:11,029
Have fun with the gifts. And...

209
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:13,463
Yes, yes.

210
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,802
Shampoo?

211
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:18,601
And a soap?

212
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,678
Hanger and a towel.

213
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:23,774
Do not talk about school with them.

214
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,149
What's going on with the school?

215
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,245
- They're closing it down.
- No.

216
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,950
- I am getting laid off.
- You?

217
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,493
You're like
the classic school principal.

218
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,189
I mean, you're, you're scary
and bad with people.

219
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,856
Children are nervous around you.

220
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:41,333
That doesn't sound right, but,
I am just saying, what else could you do?

221
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,202
Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the bogeyman.
You could be the bogeyman.

222
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:46,934
- Anyway...
- What, what?

223
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,033
I have got some interviews
set up in Arizona,

224
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:51,635
which is kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

225
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:53,179
Uh-oh.

226
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,841
I need you to watch the kids...
for a week.

227
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,852
No! No, they don't even like me!

228
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,751
It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter.

229
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:02,721
My friend Jill
is a teacher at my school.

230
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:06,021
She will bring the kids in with her
and watch them till dinnertime.

231
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:07,720
All you got to do is the night shift.

232
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,456
Why can't your stupid friend do that?

233
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:12,260
She's got night school. Skeeter!

234
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,824
My husband left me.
I am getting laid off.

235
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:17,962
I, I have to move.
I need your help.

236
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:20,633
So you need me.
This is good.

237
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:22,005
I will do it.

238
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,771
But you got to say,

239
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,812
"Skeeter is the coolest.
I am a nerd."

240
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,745
"Skeeter's the coolest.
I am a nerd?"

241
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:30,978
Yeah, you are! Whoo!

242
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:32,349
OK. Hey, you guys.

243
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:34,684
I am going to hang out with you
this week. All right?

244
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:36,552
Maybe we can go... fishing.

245
00:12:36,552 --> 00:12:39,491
I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.

246
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,891
OK, we will stay inside.

247
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:42,987
How about, uh,
we play some poker?

248
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:46,227
- I can teach you that.
- Gambling? I don't think so.

249
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:48,825
OK, how about we
just take walks in the park

250
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:51,997
- and catalog plant species?
- Now you're talking.

251
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,734
I don't know anything about plants

252
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,742
except you try to make cakes
out of them!

253
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,937
He liked that one.
I am going to end with a laugh.

254
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:01,175
Give me some. Huh?

255
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:04,149
I wasn't going to hit you.
I was trying to do the fist thing.

256
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,947
You don't know the fist thing?

257
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:07,487
OK, I was just...

258
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,947
That's what, uh, the children do.

259
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,024
Hey, yeh, yeh.

260
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:17,831
Oh, this your truck, chief?

261
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,593
Yes, it is, ma'am.

262
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:22,158
You realize you're taking up
two parking spaces?

263
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,931
It's a big truck, ma'am.

264
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:26,701
It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.

265
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:28,799
I had to park
all the way down the block.

266
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,709
Well, next time park in that box.
Plenty of room in there.

267
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,875
Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,

268
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,043
this is the hotel I work for's truck.

269
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:41,179
So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.

270
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,122
So two parking spaces
provides me with what I call

271
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:47,627
"a cushion of protection."

272
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,687
Wait, a hotel? Oh, wait.
You're Wendy's brother.

273
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,733
- Yeah.
- I am Jill.

274
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,132
- Who's that?
- I am her friend,

275
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:58,000
the one helping take care of the kids.
I am the day shift.

276
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,805
OK, June. You plan on being
this hostile the whole time?

277
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,674
Jill. My name is Jill.

278
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:07,339
Do you plan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?

279
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:11,112
Oh, haven't you heard?
Goofy's the new handsome.

280
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,386
- That sounds good for the environment.
- Oh, we can't all have Priuses.

281
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,860
How do you know I drive a Prius?

282
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,864
Your whole aura reads Prius.

283
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:30,026
Anyways, you're in my
cushion of protection right now.

284
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:33,130
I want to back up, so if you
could just zing-zang up there,

285
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,074
- that would be helpful.
- Yeah.

286
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,338
You might want some Cinnabons.
You will need it.

287
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:39,588
Food!

288
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:45,882
Give it back!
Somebody owes me six bucks!

289
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:50,652
So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hotel?

290
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:52,021
He promised your dad.

291
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:54,459
I wanted to.
It just wasn't the right time.

292
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:55,893
Let me tell you how it works.

293
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:57,726
The big man's giving the job
to Kendall

294
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,356
because he's dating his daughter.

295
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,594
That's the way it works,
keep it in the family.

296
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:04,433
He gets the girl, he gets the job,
he gets everything.

297
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:05,767
And I get nothing.

298
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,207
<i>- Hello?
-  Where are you? Still there?</i>

299
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:15,942
I am still where?
Who's this?

300
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:19,042
<i>Look, I have got to get to class.
The kids are waiting for you, OK?</i>

301
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,213
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah,
I am sorry.

302
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,052
I forgot.
I will be there in like 20 minutes.

303
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,352
I am going to baby-sit
my nephew and niece tonight.

304
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:32,058
Oh, God.
Got any advice for me?

305
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,727
Yes, I do. Sometimes I baby-sit
my cousins, right?

306
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,032
And what I do is
I let them style me hair.

307
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:40,335
Like put beads into it and braid it,
make me look all real sexy.

308
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:43,604
Like Milli Vanilli, stuff like that.
You should try that.

309
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:46,578
Braid my hair? That's a good idea.
Can I have some French fries?

310
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,275
Of course you can.
You're my best friend.

311
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:53,645
Ah! Actually, I really like
ketchup on my face

312
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,655
because it's
rejuvenating for the skin.

313
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,214
So who's the real victim?
You are.

314
00:15:58,214 --> 00:16:00,954
Mmm! Delicious.

315
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,929
Do you think these signs will help?

316
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,401
Well, miracles happen,
you know?

317
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,631
You mean like Dad coming back?

318
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:13,036
Um...

319
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:20,139
Hey!
Sorry I am late.

320
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,148
So, um, their pajamas
are on their beds,

321
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,777
and I will be back, um,
at 8:30 to pick them up, OK?

322
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,617
- All right.
- Here is my cell phone number.

323
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:31,214
And call me if there's
any emergencies.

324
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:34,090
All right. Have fun at night school.

325
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,186
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

326
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:38,424
All packed up here.

327
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:41,866
I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.

328
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:45,337
Some clean underwear.

329
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,508
Well, maybe not that clean.

330
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,002
You guys want to watch TV?

331
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:53,979
We don't have a TV.

332
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,307
<i>- Hello?
-  Emergency!</i>

333
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,585
They don't have a TV.

334
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:03,088
Wendy doesn't let them watch TV.
You didn't know?

335
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,148
I don't know a lot of things
about these kids.

336
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,922
I wasn't allowed over here.
Their old man didn't like me.

337
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:11,089
OK, listen, you don't need a TV.
You can, um, play a game, do a puzzle.

338
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,429
I am sure you can figure
something out. OK?

339
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let them
braid my hair or something?

340
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,961
Would they like that?

341
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:20,302
I don't think anyone
should touch that hair.

342
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:27,541
Hey, what do you say we go...

343
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:31,051
next door and toilet paper
your neighbor's trees?

344
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:35,019
No? OK, bedtime!

345
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,799
OK, so you guys cool?

346
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,359
You have to read us a bedtime story.

347
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,803
Yeah, all right. You have any?

348
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:58,602
Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?

349
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:01,739
<i>"Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"?</i>

350
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:03,976
Mmm, no.

351
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:07,418
<i>"The Organic Squirrel
Gets a Bike Helmet"?</i>

352
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,013
I am not reading these
communist books to you guys.

353
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,614
Don't you got any real stories?

354
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:13,990
- Like what?
- Like what?

355
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,495
Like, like cowboys? Or dragons?

356
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,794
Or aliens? Or... What the heck
is on my head right now?

357
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:22,995
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.

358
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:26,005
- Why do you call him Bugsy?
- Because of his eyes.

359
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,802
Let me see them.

360
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:34,676
Wow! Those eyes would be big on a cow.

361
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:38,982
Are those eyeballs
or bowling balls?

362
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,021
Can't keep my eyes off of them.

363
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:44,683
Just get in there so I don't have to
look at them anymore. Goodbye.

364
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:46,385
Anyways, uh,

365
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:49,224
you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?

366
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:51,230
Like, like my old man used to do for me?

367
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,822
Maybe I could be good at this.

368
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:57,330
All right, um...

369
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,598
Here goes.

370
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:03,871
Once upon a time,
in a magical, faraway kingdom...

371
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:08,645
<i>... there was a brave
and noble knight.</i>

372
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,651
<i>Strikingly handsome.</i>

373
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,516
<i>Who lived in a grand castle</i>

374
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:19,116
<i>that weary travelers from near and far
would come and visit.</i>

375
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:23,186
<i>Now, this knight had been
working his butt off for years.</i>

376
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:26,061
<i>You'd think he'd be a shoo-in
to rule the castle, right?</i>

377
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,226
<i>-  Right.
-  Wrong.</i>

378
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:33,296
<i>Actually, he wasn't
even a knight at all.</i>

379
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,573
Oh, no.

380
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,906
<i> He was, in fact,
just a lowly peasant.</i>

381
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:45,213
<i>And even though he was the son
of the late, great Lord Marty...</i>

382
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:46,980
Thank you.

383
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,115
<i>... and knew everything there is
to know about running a castle,</i>

384
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:54,160
<i>everyone just took him for granted.</i>

385
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,255
<i>His name was Mr. Underappreciated.</i>

386
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:00,266
What's "underdemeciated"?

387
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,098
- Under de-what?
- Underdemeciated.

388
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:05,400
That's right,
I forgot you were six.

389
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,771
His name was Sir... Fix-A-Lot.

390
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:11,811
<i>But alas, the kingdom
where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived</i>

391
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:16,043
<i>did not place much value on dedication
or hard work, I guess.</i>

392
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:21,645
<i>Because the superstar in all
the land was Sir Butt-Kiss.</i>

393
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:25,590
<i>And he spent all his days
kissing everybody's butt.</i>

394
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:29,291
Boo!

395
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,854
And my lord, yes,
of course I can get you

396
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:35,129
<i>front row house seats
to The Lion King.</i>

397
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:38,035
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had
a best friend, Friar Fred,

398
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:40,039
who was not right in the head.

399
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,476
She never! No! Not our queen,
I won't have that.

400
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,276
- Were there any kids in the kingdom?
- Yes, yes. Of course.

401
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,315
<i>There were two young pages.</i>

402
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:54,946
Mistress Stinky
and Master Smelly.

403
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:57,889
Hey-oh! And don't forget...

404
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,392
Jillian! The queen of the fairies!

405
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,190
<i> Queen of the fairies?</i>

406
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,561
<i>I mean, if she has to be there,
let's just make her an angry raven.</i>

407
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:11,270
Parking spot!

408
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,602
<i> She should be
a mermaid teacher.</i>

409
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:16,234
<i> Yeah. The best
mermaid teacher in the world.</i>

410
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,938
Children, open your books to page 16.

411
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:20,445
Yes, Miss Mermaid.

412
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,776
Let's begin.

413
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:24,113
All right, she's a mermaid.
Whatever you want.

414
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:25,651
Anyways, back to the story.

415
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,883
One day the king invited
all his subjects to the castle.

416
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:31,788
I bring glad tidings.

417
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:34,419
For on this day
I have chosen a champion

418
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,554
who will run this castle

419
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:41,033
and be my closest advisor
and bestest buddy.

420
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,831
My new champion is...

421
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,269
...Sir Butt-Kiss!

422
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,814
Thank you.

423
00:21:56,814 --> 00:22:01,218
Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot had been passed over.

424
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:05,588
<i>So, Sir Fix-A-Lot
moved into a giant shoe,</i>

425
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:09,186
<i>got a bad case of athlete's face,</i>

426
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:10,457
<i>dove into a moat...</i>

427
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:12,499
Ah, what the heck.

428
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,295
<i>... and got eaten by crocodiles.</i>

429
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,636
The end.

430
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,969
The end? That can't be the end.

431
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:23,305
- Why? Why not?
- It's not happy.

432
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:26,904
There aren't happy endings in real life.
Sooner you know that, the better.

433
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:29,710
- It's not fair!
- What? What's not fair?

434
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,844
I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at least get a shot to be champion?

435
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:37,322
- A shot? Hmm...
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better

436
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,360
than Sir Butt-Kiss, he should
get a chance to prove it.

437
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,861
OK. Yeah, yeah,
Bobbi, good.

438
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,727
What the king
really said was...

439
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:47,232
On second thought,

440
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,361
there is another worthy man
in my kingdom,

441
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:53,929
and it wouldn't be fair
unless he got a shot, too.

442
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,908
Sir Fix-A-Lot!

443
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,036
<i> And then the crowd went nuts.</i>

444
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:05,942
But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot
is as common as muck.

445
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:07,213
Boo!

446
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:10,256
<i> And Friar Fred
drop-kicked a booing goblin.</i>

447
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,256
Boo!

448
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,321
And the mermaid teacher did one of those
weird tail dolphin moves.

449
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,627
And Stinky and Smelly
did the fastest Irish jig ever.

450
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:25,763
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

451
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:28,467
Yeah. Right on.

452
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:31,807
<i>Prince Bugsy busted out
some fancy moves.</i>

453
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,813
And then... and then...

454
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,872
It started raining gumballs.

455
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:42,116
Raining gumballs?

456
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:45,317
Why not? It's a bedtime story.
Anything can happen.

457
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:48,418
Yeah, yeah.
I guess in a story.

458
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:51,794
I just wish it was like that
in real life. I really do.

459
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,158
- What was that?
- Bugsy.

460
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:56,908
Oh.

461
00:23:58,305 --> 00:23:59,966
He rings that bell when he's hungry?

462
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:03,339
No, when he needs to go to sleep.

463
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,541
OK. As you wish,
Your Highness.

464
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:20,453
All right, you guys, have a good sleep.
You, too, uh, weird eyes.

465
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:30,831
Well, I don't
have much to work with,

466
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,031
but I will make us

467
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:36,303
a delicious breakfast

468
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:38,970
that I know you will enjoy.

469
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,072
Yes, some banana
on the rice cake,

470
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:44,709
and then what do we call this?
Wheat germ.

471
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:47,481
I was told germs are bad for you,
but here goes.

472
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,720
I like it.

473
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,385
A rice cake-banana-wheat germ sandwich.

474
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:54,984
And what do we got?

475
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:02,226
This is terrible.

476
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:04,702
Doesn't your, your mother
have taste buds?

477
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:07,535
What are we doing here?
We got nothing to use in this house.

478
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:09,199
Hang on.

479
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,640
A little flavor.

480
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:17,676
It's good because, now we don't
have to brush our teeth.

481
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:23,344
There you go. At least we got
a little mint going on. Guys want one?

482
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,426
Hang on.

483
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:29,682
Hello!

484
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,526
Bronson? The television set
in Mr. Nottingham's room

485
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:36,728
is broken and it needs
to be fixed right away.

486
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:39,897
I have a situation here.
I am watching my nephew and my niece.

487
00:25:39,897 --> 00:25:42,407
I am sorry. Are you having
difficulty hearing me?

488
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,001
Mr. Nottingham wants
to watch television now!

489
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,512
I hear you.
I speak trollinese, don't worry.

490
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,516
<i>There's a leprechaun behind you.</i>

491
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,313
Gotcha.

492
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:57,753
Thanks a lot, gentlemen. OK.

493
00:25:57,753 --> 00:25:59,189
- Wow.
- It's pretty, huh?

494
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,248
Whoa!

495
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:04,286
I got to go fix my boss' television set,
but I need somebody to watch you two.

496
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:07,094
Violet!
Right here. Give a smile.

497
00:26:07,094 --> 00:26:08,532
Hang on.

498
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:12,231
Violet! Skeeter Bronson,
the handyman from the other day.

499
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,034
Oh, right. Yes.

500
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:16,405
Listen, uh, I got some kids
with me right now.

501
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:18,967
My nephew and niece. But,
I got to fix your father's TV.

502
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:20,706
Could you watch them a few minutes?

503
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,146
Huh?

504
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,948
Yeah, yeah. All right, I am going.

505
00:26:25,948 --> 00:26:26,908
Come in.

506
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:34,284
- Mr. Nottingham, sir?
- Uh, the telly won't turn on.

507
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:37,922
It won't? Well, let me just
take a... tallyho at it, OK?

508
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:39,761
I will just flip this light on.

509
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:43,428
No, no, no, no!
Absolutely not!

510
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:44,970
I am fighting a cold here.

511
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,370
I must stay in the dark
whenever possible.

512
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,930
Do you realize

513
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,911
germs can reproduce
80 percent faster in bright light?

514
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,812
Oh, OK. Here we go,
nice and dark again.

515
00:26:55,812 --> 00:26:58,248
- The germs are confused.
- Come towards me.

516
00:26:58,248 --> 00:27:01,116
OK. It's got to be
around here somewhere.

517
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:04,988
For heaven's sake.

518
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:07,492
I am so sorry, sir.
I just can't see a thing.

519
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,756
- To your left, there.
- Oh!

520
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:13,322
There's the TV. So how's the,
uh, new hotel coming, sir?

521
00:27:13,322 --> 00:27:17,427
Oh, very well. Still dealing with the
city on building permits and whatnot.

522
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,971
Uh-huh.

523
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,768
I can't tell you the secret theme.

524
00:27:20,768 --> 00:27:23,207
It's so good, we don't want
anyone to steal it.

525
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:26,211
- I hear you, sir.
- OK, I will tell you.

526
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,304
Come along, sit down. Please.

527
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:29,712
Great.

528
00:27:30,584 --> 00:27:32,347
Ready?

529
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,245
Rock and roll.

530
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:39,315
Vintage vinyl.
Music memorabilia in the lobby.

531
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:42,623
Oh, OK. Like, uh, like the Hard Rock?

532
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:45,460
- The What What?
- The Hard Rock Hotel.

533
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,524
They have been using
that theme for, like, years.

534
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:54,537
Get Kendall Duncan
up here straightaway, please.

535
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:56,838
What a perfect
little powder puff.

536
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:01,838
Thank you.

537
00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:05,407
So, Patrick, truth or dare?

538
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:06,127
Truth?

539
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,915
How old were you the first time
you kissed a girl?

540
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:13,050
Patrick never kissed a girl.

541
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,094
Girls are bis-crusting.

542
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:18,829
Except for Trisha Sparks.

543
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:21,732
Ooh, is that a girl in your class,
you little Romeo?

544
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:22,927
Hey, guys.

545
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:25,369
Hi, Aunt Jill, did you
get the note we left you?

546
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,269
Yes, I did.

547
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:30,241
And, uh, now we have to get you guys
ready for school. So, come on.

548
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,278
- Hi.
- Hi.

549
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,414
Oh, hey. You're, uh...

550
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:39,942
- Uh-huh. Here's your fat mouse.
- It's a guinea pig, but...

551
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:43,148
And you, young man...

552
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:47,990
I want to hear all about this little
Trisha Sparks next time I see you.

553
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:53,389
Trisha Sparks is
two years older than you.

554
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:55,832
She's hot.

555
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:02,968
I am very disappointed in you, Kendall.
We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.

556
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:08,310
This rock and roll idea
of yours is old hat.

557
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,943
Well, sir, I had every intention
of putting our own spin on it.

558
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:14,316
Do you know what, Skeeter?

559
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:17,015
I am starting to get a fuzzy recollection

560
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,217
of something I said to your father.

561
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:23,160
In fact, I am going to give you a shot.

562
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:28,401
If you can come up with a better theme
than Kendall does,

563
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:30,663
I will let you run the new place instead.

564
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:33,001
Oh, sir.

565
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:36,008
Don't you think this is perhaps
a little too much of a cruel joke

566
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:39,239
to be playing on somebody as...
well, the, the maintenance guy?

567
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:41,576
- No, I don't.
- No.

568
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:46,483
Mr. Bronson has been working
for this company for 25 years.

569
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:50,956
I am beginning to think I may have
seriously underdemeciated him.

570
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,322
I am sorry.
"Underdemeciated"?

571
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:58,797
Precisely. You can both present your
ideas at my birthday party this weekend.

572
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,333
Thank you, Kendall.
That is all.

573
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,835
Mr. Bronson, the television,
if you would.

574
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,838
Oh, and do watch out
for the germ vaporizer.

575
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,939
The best day of my life!

576
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:14,276
<i># Amadeus Amadeus</i>

577
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:17,316
<i># Amadeus Ow! Amadeus
Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

578
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,353
<i># Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus</i>

579
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,820
<i># Ooh, rock me Amadeus</i>

580
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,653
<i># Amadeus Amadeus</i>

581
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:29,725
Whoa. I like your car, pal.

582
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:31,730
Hey, thanks, champ.
You know what they say.

583
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,130
You want to be the best,
you got to drive the best.

584
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,963
Hey, uh, not to get personal,

585
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:38,698
but what's a sweet ride
like that cost, anyways?

586
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:41,468
You know what? Actually it's
surprisingly affordable.

587
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:42,530
Yeah?

588
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,737
If you saved every paycheck you
earn for the rest of your life

589
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:49,145
and then multiply it by ten, you
could probably buy my muffler.

590
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:53,317
Ah-ooga!

591
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:55,752
Oh, you want to drag race, do you?

592
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:02,256
You win! Good job.

593
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:24,579
What?

594
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:55,337
This is spooky.

595
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:05,856
You have got to be kidding me!
Look at this. I am losing all my candy.

596
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:09,884
How can you not see
a 50-foot trailer? Come on.

597
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:17,835
So you have to compete for your job with
Skeeter Bronson. You will annihilate him.

598
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,896
Oh, I know. It's just
a little degrading, that's all.

599
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:25,942
Thanks for being there.

600
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:30,312
I will be there as long as
there's a there to be at.

601
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:35,284
Oh, hello, children.

602
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:37,414
We're looking for Skeeter Bronson.

603
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,685
Oh, Mr. Bronson.

604
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,954
Yes, you will find him in room 109.

605
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:44,121
- OK.
- Please, this way.

606
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:56,972
- Oh, my God! Did you see that thing?
- Those eyes.

607
00:32:56,972 --> 00:32:59,978
They were, they were staring
into my, my very soul.

608
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,448
- Hey, Uncle Skeeter!
- Hey!

609
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,974
- Just who I wanted to see.
- Hey, chief, here's Bugsy.

610
00:33:06,974 --> 00:33:08,680
- Got him.
- Why do they have to stay here?

611
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,723
Because I am on call tonight,
Jennifer.

612
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:13,054
It's Jill, actually, Scooter.

613
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:14,457
It is? OK, yeah...

614
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,361
You did not just do that.

615
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:20,160
I did. Watch.
I am going to do it again.

616
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:25,066
So, guys, anything weird
happen to you today?

617
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:28,335
I had a substitute teacher
with an eye patch.

618
00:33:28,335 --> 00:33:31,434
Uh... that's a little weird.
I am talking like big-time weird.

619
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:33,945
Maybe coincidence weird, uh...

620
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,914
...as in gumball weird?

621
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,814
We're not allowed to chew gum.

622
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:42,252
Of course you're not.
You guys want to go to sleep?

623
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:43,846
It's only 5:30.

624
00:33:43,846 --> 00:33:45,356
And we haven't had dinner.

625
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,316
Hmm. OK.

626
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:49,723
Room service!

627
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:53,664
So you have never
been skateboarding?

628
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,257
You have never played video games?

629
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:57,530
Mom says they rot your brain.

630
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,973
That's not true. I have been playing video
games my whole life, and look at me.

631
00:34:04,277 --> 00:34:06,768
Yeah, maybe she's got a point.

632
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:09,406
You. You have never eaten bacon?

633
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:11,382
What's bacon?

634
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,420
Bacon is the juicy,
fatty part of the pig

635
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,682
right adjacent to the rear.

636
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:21,625
But delicious and tasty,
not how I just made it sound.

637
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:25,357
And this is the first hamburger
you have ever eaten?

638
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:28,628
- What's the verdict? What do you think?
- Life-changing.

639
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:31,067
- Mom's going to kill us.
- No, she isn't.

640
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:33,605
First of all, she's never
going to find out about this.

641
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,870
And second of all, she used to eat
plenty of hamburgers

642
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,036
when we were growing up
in this very room.

643
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,444
She did?

644
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:44,677
Looks like Bugsy's eaten a lot
of burgers in the last ten minutes.

645
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:47,642
Wow!

646
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:50,553
He keeps going like that,
we could make bacon out of Bugsy.

647
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,491
He's kidding, Bugsy.
Take it easy.

648
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:57,757
OK. Let's get you carnivores to bed.

649
00:34:57,757 --> 00:34:59,821
I got a, a new story
I want to lay on you.

650
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:01,764
What do you think
of cowboys and Indians?

651
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:04,564
Oh, yes, tonight's the night!

652
00:35:04,564 --> 00:35:07,333
I just like cowboys and Indians
because of the conflict.

653
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,874
OK, once upon a time in the Old West,

654
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:13,434
before room service was
even invented...

655
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:16,971
<i>... there was a farm hand
named Jeremiah Skeets.</i>

656
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:19,109
<i>He was looking to get
ahead in the world,</i>

657
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:20,447
<i>but was having a problem</i>

658
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:22,613
<i>with his current mode
of transportation.</i>

659
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:29,391
Uh, that was my horse.
That wasn't me, everybody.

660
00:35:30,763 --> 00:35:33,061
<i>Someone once told Jeremiah</i>

661
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:35,327
<i>that if he wanted to be the best,</i>

662
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:37,892
<i>he'd have to ride the best.</i>

663
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:39,995
You mind showing me your finest horse?

664
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:48,373
My ancestors believe horse spirit

665
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:52,714
come down from mountain
during time of fire, wind.

666
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:58,415
Many brave warrior
walk trail of moon bear...

667
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:02,325
OK. Look, I just want to see your finest
horse, not a whole thing there.

668
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:05,762
- Sorry. I can do it.
- All right.

669
00:36:05,762 --> 00:36:08,699
Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari.

670
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,235
Ferrari.

671
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:14,903
Oh, my.

672
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:17,704
Oh, my, oh, my!

673
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:19,039
Look at that.

674
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,205
Whoa!

675
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:24,977
I would get automatic respect
riding such a beautiful animal,

676
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:28,145
but I am afraid that's just
a bit out of my price range.

677
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,349
Tell you what, white bread.

678
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:34,086
I will give you Ferrari...

679
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:37,694
...for free!

680
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:40,392
Boo-yah!
The end. I love it.

681
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:44,232
Brilliant story.
So he got the Ferrari for free.

682
00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:45,861
I love that. I love that.

683
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:50,272
A guy getting a free horse?
That's not a good story.

684
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:55,374
Where's the arc? There's no arc.
I have not learned anything.

685
00:36:55,374 --> 00:36:57,848
Also, you have got
a moral obligation to them.

686
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,942
What are they going to
walk away from that with?

687
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:03,147
I didn't know we were doing
an After School Special.

688
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:05,782
Why can't he do something
a real gentleman would do,

689
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:07,723
like save a damsel in distress?

690
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,427
Not a bad idea, munchkin.

691
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:15,126
OK. So, uh...
let's continue.

692
00:37:15,126 --> 00:37:17,761
<i> Jeremiah was
out for a ride when...</i>

693
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,033
Oh, please, don't!

694
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:24,907
- Give us that jewelry.
- You want my pearls? Help! Please!

695
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:28,777
Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoo!

696
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:33,318
Oh, my necklace? Here, take it.

697
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,320
Come on, boy!

698
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,288
Here.

699
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,415
What else you got, sweetie?

700
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:41,722
Help! Help!

701
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:47,022
Leave the lady alone!

702
00:37:53,573 --> 00:37:55,632
Care for a lift, ma'am?

703
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:57,471
- Yeah.
- Oh!

704
00:37:57,471 --> 00:38:01,912
- Nice horse.
- Oh, what, this old thing?

705
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,007
Now, any of you gentlemen want to give
the nice lady her stuff back?

706
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:06,779
Not a chance, huh?

707
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:09,344
Because I beg to differ!

708
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:11,617
- My hero.
- I like that.

709
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:16,554
<i> So Jeremiah spirited
Miss Davenport away to safety,</i>

710
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:17,823
<i>when she says...</i>

711
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:20,263
Shall we go drink champagne
in a nearby hot tub?

712
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,565
- Hot tub?
- Mmm.

713
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,571
Uh, yeah. No.

714
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:30,234
I was saying that because I wanted to
see if you two were paying attention.

715
00:38:32,545 --> 00:38:35,605
<i>What happened was Jeremiah
dropped Miss Davenport off</i>

716
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,013
<i>in the nearest town, safe and sound.</i>

717
00:38:38,013 --> 00:38:39,813
How ever can I thank you, sir?

718
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:42,116
Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am.

719
00:38:42,116 --> 00:38:45,157
But I do insist on expressing
my gratitude in some manner.

720
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:48,386
Fair enough. I will take...

721
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:51,726
...$100 million.

722
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:54,493
The end. Let's hope it works.

723
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:56,831
Very well written,
brilliantly constructed.

724
00:38:56,831 --> 00:39:00,134
Jeremiah wouldn't take money
for doing a good deed.

725
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:03,004
Uh... I know Jeremiah
a lot better than you guys.

726
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:05,566
And believe me, he'd be all over that.
He loves money.

727
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:06,942
Mmm!

728
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:09,481
I don't want that.
Go back, rewrite. Rewrite.

729
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,346
Gentlemen don't get paid.

730
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:13,851
Will you just...
Who's telling the story here?

731
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,013
It should really end more like this.

732
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:19,023
Well, I must give you
some token of my appreciation.

733
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,285
Oh, no.

734
00:39:20,285 --> 00:39:22,452
Perhaps... a kiss?

735
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:24,556
Touchdown.

736
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:28,360
<i> Then an angry dwarf kicks him.</i>

737
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,110
Ow!

738
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:32,868
What the heck did you do that for?

739
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:34,907
Because I am angry.

740
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:36,839
Go! Let's go!

741
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,100
All right! Yeah!

742
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:41,904
I didn't do nothing to you!

743
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:44,176
- The end.
- You know what?

744
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,582
Laugh as much as you want.
I will take a Ferrari

745
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:48,620
and a kiss any day of the week.

746
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,485
I'd just like to kiss a Ferrari.

747
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,958
- All right. Good night.
- Good night, Uncle Skeeter.

748
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,551
Good night, home slice.

749
00:39:56,551 --> 00:39:59,257
Thanks for the stories.

750
00:39:59,257 --> 00:40:01,232
You came up with
all the good parts, Bobbi.

751
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,131
Good night, you all.

752
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:04,897
You too there, Bugsy.

753
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:11,302
And them braids look fantastic.
They have taken years off you.

754
00:40:11,302 --> 00:40:13,868
You mind sleeping over?
I am going to duck out a few hours.

755
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:16,608
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Mmm. By the way, um,

756
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:18,809
I am, uh, legally obliged to tell you

757
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:22,877
that I suffer from...
sleep panic disorder.

758
00:40:22,877 --> 00:40:25,480
OK, what's, uh, sleep panic disorder?

759
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,049
Believe me, you don't want to know.

760
00:40:38,037 --> 00:40:41,996
What am I thinking? Why would
anyone give me a free Ferrari?

761
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:44,304
I must be losing my mind.

762
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:48,703
Much power of the horse
underneath that hood.

763
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:55,847
Hello.

764
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,887
Are you the guy I am supposed to see?

765
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,789
I am here, aren't I?

766
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:11,826
So... am I about to get
a cherry red Ferrari?

767
00:41:14,674 --> 00:41:16,005
I don't see why not.

768
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:24,322
For... free?

769
00:41:28,888 --> 00:41:33,825
Sounds good to... me!

770
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:37,752
What do I do now?
Eat a gumball or something?

771
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,154
Yes.

772
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,838
- Fell out of the sky, right?
- Yeah.

773
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,895
Shh!

774
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:49,964
Oh! Shh.

775
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:51,407
I won't tell nobody.

776
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:57,382
Now, close your eyes
and count to three.

777
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,213
- OK.
- Then it's all going to happen.

778
00:41:59,213 --> 00:42:00,274
- No.
- Yeah.

779
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,380
- One, two...
- Yeah.

780
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,549
...three.

781
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:07,922
Ferrari!

782
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:11,053
Hey! My wallet!

783
00:42:11,053 --> 00:42:12,859
Not anymore!

784
00:42:16,836 --> 00:42:19,737
Excuse me.
Hi, boys.

785
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:24,842
OK, thank you.

786
00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:32,440
Thanks, guys. Sorry.
I am just trying to find my car.

787
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:37,080
Good thing my wallet
only had three dollars in it.

788
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,681
And my Derek Jeter baseball card!

789
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:43,126
Guys, guys, stop, please.

790
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,627
You have had enough, now.
Thank you.

791
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:47,791
Stop!

792
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,365
Come on, man!

793
00:42:57,365 --> 00:43:00,173
- Care for a lift, ma'am?
- Skeeter?

794
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:02,271
- Skeeter Bronson?
- Yes, ma'am.

795
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:06,244
What do you say you boys

796
00:43:06,244 --> 00:43:08,809
give the pretty lady back
the pictures you took?

797
00:43:10,356 --> 00:43:13,587
Sure about that, now?
Because I beg to differ.

798
00:43:15,394 --> 00:43:16,486
Guy's got a gun!

799
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:21,689
I am just happy they
didn't make me use this thing.

800
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:27,999
- My hero.
- Really?

801
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,439
That was brilliant, Skeeter.

802
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:33,478
I don't know what happened.
Something came over me.

803
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:35,013
It felt good.
It felt really good.

804
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:36,980
How am I ever going to thank you?

805
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,980
Hmm.

806
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,444
No thanks is necessary, ma'am?

807
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:45,251
Oh, am I in the presence
of a gentleman?

808
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:47,519
At your service, ma'am.

809
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,085
Well, I must show
my appreciation in some form.

810
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,051
Ow!

811
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:59,431
Consider yourself
big people-bashed, sucker.

812
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:00,995
I knew you were going to show up.

813
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:04,270
Get in the Gremlin, Jimmy,
before Sasquatch calls the cops.

814
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,971
Yeah, because that's
how we do what we do. Right?

815
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:08,343
That's what you get, buddy.

816
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:12,145
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Let's go! Yeah!

817
00:44:12,145 --> 00:44:14,516
Pull me in. Let's get
out of here. Pull me in!

818
00:44:14,516 --> 00:44:17,249
Big people stink!

819
00:44:18,457 --> 00:44:21,153
OK, well, you don't see that every day.

820
00:44:21,153 --> 00:44:26,995
Indeed. And on that strange note,
I bid you good night.

821
00:44:26,995 --> 00:44:29,728
Yes, yes.

822
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:30,568
Oh! Oh!

823
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,539
All right, so that's how I am getting it.

824
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,669
- Getting what?
- This is just... I shouldn't.

825
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:42,373
I, I couldn't. You know what?
I can. I am going to take it.

826
00:44:42,373 --> 00:44:44,348
What are you talking about?

827
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,850
I am talking about a very generous girl

828
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,719
who wants to give her rescuer
a cherry red Ferrari...

829
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:52,814
...for free!

830
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,316
This is sick!

831
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:59,160
Well, uh, good luck with that.
I am just going to go.

832
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,323
What do you mean?

833
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,367
Do you have another one at your house?

834
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,868
Am I, am I supposed
to follow you or something?

835
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,030
So seriously, no, no Ferrari?

836
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:13,041
Where's the $100 million, at least?!

837
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,107
Boo!

838
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,214
<i> Hey, hey, hey!
Get your own campaign vehicle.</i>

839
00:45:20,214 --> 00:45:22,049
Yeah.

840
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:24,851
- Hi.
- Hey, Aunt Jill.

841
00:45:24,851 --> 00:45:26,949
Hey, guys.
How did last night go?

842
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:30,427
An angry dwarf kicked me in the leg,
and I didn't get a free Ferrari.

843
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,554
So there you go.

844
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:33,791
Oh. How sad.

845
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:37,199
- He's talking about our bedtime story.
- Oh.

846
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,500
Uncle Skeeter said Jeremiah would get
a new horse and a kiss,

847
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,472
but I said the dwarf would kick him.

848
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,239
You said it.

849
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,280
Maybe that's how it works.

850
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,939
The kids control the stories.

851
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:54,485
And there are the wind chimes.
You know what that means.

852
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,713
What what means?

853
00:45:55,713 --> 00:45:56,713
Huh?

854
00:45:58,057 --> 00:46:00,218
Nothing.
Don't worry about it.

855
00:46:00,218 --> 00:46:01,350
I won't.

856
00:46:02,895 --> 00:46:06,558
OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing?

857
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:13,402
Working off the hamburgers
he ate last night.

858
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:16,270
Yes, I gave Bugsy some hamburgers,

859
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:19,903
but I gave the children
that wheat germ stuff

860
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,640
because that's what they love.

861
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,013
I guess it's, uh, Bugsy
watching the TV then too?

862
00:46:25,013 --> 00:46:27,678
Yeah, I flipped that on
and, look, he's glued to it.

863
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:33,081
I am innocent!

864
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:35,959
What was that?

865
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,259
Uh... that was the sleep
panic disorder, I believe.

866
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:42,300
Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.

867
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncle a kiss.

868
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:46,768
I am a relative, I deserve it.
Right there.

869
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:48,534
Oh, that felt nice.

870
00:46:48,534 --> 00:46:50,541
How about one more for the road?

871
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:54,272
- No.
- Come on, baby!

872
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:57,008
Don't worry, we will be back tonight.

873
00:46:57,008 --> 00:46:58,515
Yeah, no, I am not worried.

874
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,984
You're coming back,
we got a big story tonight!

875
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,750
About some hotel theme ideas!
Yeah!

876
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,519
- Maybe we won't come back.
- What?

877
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,153
- Skeeter?
- Sir Butt-Kiss. Sir... Kendall.

878
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:14,962
I understand that you feel a need
to prepare for our little... showdown.

879
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:16,865
- Yeah.
- That does not excuse you

880
00:47:16,865 --> 00:47:18,698
from maintenance responsibilities.

881
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:20,705
- Oh, no. Check.
- Lights are out in the spa.

882
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:23,207
- The south service elevator is slow.
- Check.

883
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,833
Let me try that cheesecake.

884
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:28,579
Oh, another thing.

885
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,879
I heard about your big hero act
with my girlfriend last night.

886
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:35,920
- This paparazzi was...
- I know what it is you're trying to do,

887
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,751
and it's not going to work.

888
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:39,381
You have to find another way

889
00:47:39,381 --> 00:47:42,222
to cozy up to the old man
because I am here to tell you

890
00:47:42,222 --> 00:47:46,526
Violet Nottingham is not going to
date a gum-scraping handyman.

891
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:50,392
Hey, Kendall.

892
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:55,838
Two things. First off,
you got something right there.

893
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:00,004
Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.

894
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:03,515
Good. Secondly, when I get
the job at the new hotel,

895
00:48:03,515 --> 00:48:07,746
I was actually considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.

896
00:48:09,088 --> 00:48:12,785
Your brief little trip
to the land of make-believe

897
00:48:12,785 --> 00:48:15,053
is just about over, my friend. OK?

898
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:18,426
We all know your failed father
ran this hotel into the ground,

899
00:48:18,426 --> 00:48:21,159
and thankfully, you will not
get the chance to make

900
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,030
the same mistake all over again.

901
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:26,569
May want to pick that up.

902
00:48:33,846 --> 00:48:35,711
<i>- It's Duncan.
-  Lover, hello.</i>

903
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:37,271
I am looking for the hotel site.

904
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:39,476
<i>I gave you the address,
macho bunny.</i>

905
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:42,281
The address you gave me is no good.
There's a school here.

906
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:45,221
<i>- Oh, what school?
- Webster Elementary School.</i>

907
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:48,054
<i>- Oh, then you're in the right place.
- Is that so?</i>

908
00:48:48,054 --> 00:48:50,857
<i>- This school is being shut down.
- Uh-huh.</i>

909
00:48:50,857 --> 00:48:53,864
<i>The old man pulled a few strings
at the board of education.</i>

910
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,457
<i>- Really?
- We start demolition immediately.</i>

911
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:58,662
That is very exciting news.

912
00:48:58,662 --> 00:49:00,967
<i>Oh, Pinky.
</i>

913
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:06,851
<i> Hello!</i>

914
00:49:08,547 --> 00:49:10,481
Skeeter? Hey, it's Wendy.

915
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:13,746
<i>- Hey, sissy.
- Hey. How's it going?</i>

916
00:49:13,746 --> 00:49:16,447
<i>- Are the kids OK?
- Oh, yeah. We're having a blast.</i>

917
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:17,989
<i>That was impressive, Bobbi,</i>

918
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:21,150
<i>but Uncle Skeeter can jump
over the couch the long way.</i>

919
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:24,559
<i>- Skeeter, can I talk to them?
- No, I am taking them camping.</i>

920
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,359
<i>- No.
- Have fun in Arizona. Bye!</i>

921
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,366
Camping? No, Skeeter,
they could get poison ivy!

922
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,267
- Let's go. Quietly.
- Where are we going?

923
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:34,305
- Someplace special, fools.
- Whoo-hoo!

924
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:38,104
Now march, march,
march, march...

925
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:39,974
<i># I don't know
but it's been said</i>

926
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:41,637
<i># Bugsy's eyes
pop out of his head</i>

927
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:43,943
March, march, march...

928
00:49:43,943 --> 00:49:46,143
- Whoo-hoo!
- March, let's go.

929
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:49,481
Whoa! Cool!

930
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:51,853
We're going to have ourselves
a camp-out.

931
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:54,984
You guys, look what he's done!
Isn't this cool?

932
00:49:54,984 --> 00:49:57,460
- See? See how nice I am?
- Yeah.

933
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,588
Whoa, OK, just be careful
around the fire.

934
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:03,260
Hey, Jill. Shh.
Don't want everyone to hear we're here.

935
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:09,668
I heard about marshmallows.
Saw them in magazines.

936
00:50:09,668 --> 00:50:12,676
I never imagined they
would be this good.

937
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,838
Let's just hope your mother
doesn't find out I gave you any.

938
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:18,576
- I won't tell her.
- I am not talking about you.

939
00:50:18,576 --> 00:50:19,912
She's the weak link.

940
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:22,419
I think I can let this one slide.

941
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,547
Ahh! The mermaid's being cool.
Look at that.

942
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:27,489
- The what?
- The nothing.

943
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:33,427
You know, when we were younger
and your mom and I were out on the roof,

944
00:50:33,427 --> 00:50:35,830
my dad would always tell us
to look at the stars

945
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:40,065
and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...

946
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:42,698
Right over there.
Right over there. Look, look.

947
00:50:42,698 --> 00:50:44,401
To me, that looks like a camel.

948
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:46,569
You see the humps? Huh?
The tongue hanging out?

949
00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:48,010
Oh, yeah. I see that.

950
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,105
Hey, look over there!
It's a pyramid.

951
00:50:50,105 --> 00:50:52,548
Yeah!
Hey, good one, Patrick.

952
00:50:52,548 --> 00:50:55,519
Look, right next to the moon.
Right, right beside it.

953
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,612
It looks exactly like Bugsy.

954
00:50:57,612 --> 00:51:00,089
Oh, my God!

955
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:03,093
Don't worry, Bugsy.
Your eyes are still bigger.

956
00:51:06,999 --> 00:51:09,126
Uncle Skeeter?

957
00:51:09,126 --> 00:51:10,600
Yes, good-looking.

958
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,136
Do you think my father will come back?

959
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:21,073
Um...
Well, that's a tough one.

960
00:51:23,982 --> 00:51:28,282
He must be going through some...
mental malfunction

961
00:51:28,282 --> 00:51:33,120
to not want to be with you two guys
every second of the day.

962
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,821
But, uh, I do know this.

963
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:40,524
You're always going to have your mother.

964
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:43,864
You're always going to have
this girl to hang out with.

965
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:47,336
And me, I ain't ever going anywhere.

966
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:49,424
OK?

967
00:51:50,242 --> 00:51:54,178
I am like the stink on your feet.
I will always be around.

968
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:02,578
OK. You guys made me late.
I hope you're happy.

969
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,452
Well, thank you.
Have fun at night school.

970
00:52:06,825 --> 00:52:08,622
See you tomorrow.

971
00:52:08,622 --> 00:52:11,060
All right, we got rid of her,
so let's get to business.

972
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,994
Put the samores down.
Story time.

973
00:52:12,994 --> 00:52:17,932
All right, guys. Tonight's story's
going to be extra special.

974
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:19,800
It's called...

975
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,774
<i>... The Great Hotel Idea Story.</i>

976
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:25,935
Yeah!

977
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,206
- What?
- Boring.

978
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:30,180
Come on, guys,
I really need you to do this.

979
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,011
It's going to help
my life a lot. Please?

980
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,582
All right, you know what?

981
00:52:34,582 --> 00:52:36,951
We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.

982
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:39,388
How about some Evel Knievel stuff?

983
00:52:39,388 --> 00:52:42,859
Racing, jumping, flying...

984
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:45,328
Or maybe something like romantic?

985
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:48,857
I have a good idea.

986
00:52:48,857 --> 00:52:52,062
Let's combine the action
and the romance

987
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:54,799
and make a romaction story.

988
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:57,000
- Yeah.
- Let us begin.

989
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,511
The greatest of all the heroes
in ancient Greece

990
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,047
was, of course, Skeetacus.

991
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,517
<i>He was truly amazing</i>

992
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:11,579
<i>yet totally underrated
and had been ignored for years.</i>

993
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:16,923
<i>Finally Skeetacus had his chance
to show his skills in the grand arena.</i>

994
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:21,393
<i>If he could impress the
daughter of the emperor,</i>

995
00:53:21,393 --> 00:53:24,594
<i>he knew he would one day rule the land.</i>

996
00:53:27,606 --> 00:53:30,166
<i>- Skeetacus, Skeetacus!
- Go on, Skeetacus!</i>

997
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:33,177
That's pretty fancy chariot work.

998
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:34,678
For a peasant.

999
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:37,510
<i># I see London, I see France</i>

1000
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,914
<i># I see my golden underpants</i>

1001
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:41,714
Whoo!

1002
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:53,224
Oh, wh... what is he doing?

1003
00:53:54,433 --> 00:53:55,491
Whoa!

1004
00:54:00,305 --> 00:54:01,738
Bring on the elephants!

1005
00:54:05,143 --> 00:54:06,610
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

1006
00:54:08,013 --> 00:54:09,537
All right.

1007
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,309
<i> You know how Hercules</i>

1008
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:13,351
<i>supposedly founded the Olympics?</i>

1009
00:54:18,123 --> 00:54:22,150
<i>Well, Skeetacus invented the X Games.</i>

1010
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,751
He's never going to make it!

1011
00:54:37,142 --> 00:54:38,507
Now that's first class.

1012
00:54:40,045 --> 00:54:41,137
Hey!

1013
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:43,078
- Bravo!
- Wow.

1014
00:54:44,983 --> 00:54:47,850
Can you dig it?

1015
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,114
Skeetacus!

1016
00:54:50,114 --> 00:54:52,019
How we doing so far, huh?

1017
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:56,117
- This is the best story yet.
- Can we get to the romance now?

1018
00:54:56,117 --> 00:54:57,991
<i> Well, shorty, you tell me?</i>

1019
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:00,588
<i>Does Skeetacus get
the girl he was after?</i>

1020
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,132
<i> In these stories,</i>

1021
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,691
<i>the hero always gets the fairest
maiden in the land.</i>

1022
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:07,260
Yes! You said it!
OK, so it's going to happen!

1023
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,399
Uh, right. So, what? They're thirsty?
They go off for drinks?

1024
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:12,943
A little wine and cheese action? Yes?

1025
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:18,005
<i> Yeah, they can go to an old
tavern. And guess who's there?</i>

1026
00:55:18,005 --> 00:55:20,017
Led Zeppelin.
Say Led Zeppelin, please.

1027
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:23,987
No. All the girls that were mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1028
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,353
What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1029
00:55:26,353 --> 00:55:28,255
He was like
the coolest guy in school.

1030
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,294
That's not what Mom said.

1031
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:32,353
All right, everybody was
mean to Skeetacus.

1032
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:35,194
He had problems.
All right, tell your story.

1033
00:55:35,194 --> 00:55:36,564
Oh, my God...

1034
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:37,966
<i> They see he's now with</i>

1035
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:39,799
<i>the fairest maiden in all the land,</i>

1036
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:43,238
<i>and they are really jealous.</i>

1037
00:55:43,238 --> 00:55:45,469
<i> So jealous they
don't know what to do.</i>

1038
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:48,377
They just start nervously
doing the hokey-pokey.

1039
00:55:48,377 --> 00:55:50,277
<i> # Put your right hand in</i>

1040
00:55:50,277 --> 00:55:52,145
<i># You put your right hand out</i>

1041
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:53,912
<i># You put your right hand in</i>

1042
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:55,919
<i># And you shake it all about</i>

1043
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:58,039
OK.

1044
00:55:58,924 --> 00:56:00,949
<i> So then,</i>

1045
00:56:00,949 --> 00:56:03,688
<i>Skeetacus takes his date
out to the beach.</i>

1046
00:56:03,688 --> 00:56:06,959
<i> All of a sudden,
a big hairy guy</i>

1047
00:56:06,959 --> 00:56:10,331
<i>washes up onshore, passed out.</i>

1048
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:12,267
<i> Why a hairy guy?
I don't get it.</i>

1049
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:13,429
<i> Just because.</i>

1050
00:56:13,429 --> 00:56:16,702
<i>He had something stuck in his throat,
and he wasn't breathing.</i>

1051
00:56:20,312 --> 00:56:23,907
- Thanks.
- He's OK.

1052
00:56:23,907 --> 00:56:27,179
And then it starts pouring,
so they run into a magical cave.

1053
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:30,221
- Caves are nice.
- And Abe Lincoln's there.

1054
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,620
Abe Lincoln?
What, is this a joke to you?

1055
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,558
What the heck's the matter with you?
Oh, I am sorry.

1056
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,821
I, I didn't mean to yell.

1057
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:39,386
The Abe Lincoln thing, that's,
that's a good idea.

1058
00:56:39,386 --> 00:56:43,423
It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?

1059
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:46,902
Don't you think he should?
It's... been a long time for him.

1060
00:56:46,902 --> 00:56:52,069
His lips are very dry
from not using them.

1061
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:53,770
Bugsy, you with me?

1062
00:56:56,815 --> 00:56:58,407
We will see.

1063
00:56:58,407 --> 00:57:01,043
<i>-  Hello?
- Mmm.</i>

1064
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:03,747
Hey, is this the fairest maiden
in the land?

1065
00:57:03,747 --> 00:57:05,847
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?

1066
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:09,223
<i>Yes, it is. Sorry about that Ferrari
confusion the other night.</i>

1067
00:57:09,223 --> 00:57:12,730
I am here at the beach right now
and I had a hunch you might be here too.

1068
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,560
What do you say
we get a little lunchsky?

1069
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,123
<i>That sounds so delightful.</i>

1070
00:57:16,123 --> 00:57:19,227
But I can't. I am afraid I am
on my way to Vegas for the day.

1071
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:21,666
Vegas?

1072
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:24,106
Uh, no one talked about Vegas.

1073
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:26,439
Don't tell Kendall.
He thinks I am in the library.

1074
00:57:26,439 --> 00:57:28,843
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,

1075
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:31,108
I, I really thought we
were going to hang out today.

1076
00:57:31,108 --> 00:57:33,912
Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.

1077
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:34,974
<i>Bye, Skeeter.</i>

1078
00:57:36,187 --> 00:57:37,916
Hmm.

1079
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:41,015
So our date's going to be tomorrow?
I can live with that.

1080
00:57:41,015 --> 00:57:44,118
Hey! Look out! Look out!

1081
00:57:44,118 --> 00:57:48,564
Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I am so sorry!

1082
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:51,864
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?

1083
00:57:51,864 --> 00:57:54,461
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

1084
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:56,404
I am supposed to be
looking for a job now,

1085
00:57:56,404 --> 00:57:59,637
but for some reason I felt like
coming to the beach today.

1086
00:57:59,637 --> 00:58:00,939
Huh.

1087
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,479
Um, are you hungry?

1088
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,539
Yes, I am always hungry
when I am in pain.

1089
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:07,710
Good. Because I am buying.

1090
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,550
I will let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,

1091
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:13,819
- so how was I going to pay?
- Of course you got your wallet stolen.

1092
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:17,225
- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's always something with you.

1093
00:58:17,225 --> 00:58:19,126
- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.

1094
00:58:19,126 --> 00:58:21,722
- going to wear that all day?
- I am not wearing nobody's hat.

1095
00:58:21,722 --> 00:58:24,496
- I am wearing your hat! Oh!
- I will take it back. Thanks.

1096
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,706
This is perfect for your free lunch.

1097
00:58:32,706 --> 00:58:35,837
Oh, my gosh. You guys,
you guys, you guys. Over there.

1098
00:58:35,837 --> 00:58:37,848
Is that...
is that Skeeter Bronson?

1099
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,383
- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.

1100
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:41,817
- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.

1101
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:44,081
Hey! Do you remember me?

1102
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:47,056
It's Donna Hynde from high school.

1103
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,888
Yeah, I do.

1104
00:58:48,888 --> 00:58:52,555
Thought I was going to run into you
shortly. And here you are.

1105
00:58:52,555 --> 00:58:55,861
Yeah. Wow, this is so...
weird. Uh...

1106
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:58,402
We were just planning
our high school reunion.

1107
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:01,735
We were totally just talking about you.
It's so weird.

1108
00:59:01,735 --> 00:59:03,774
I was just talking about you guys too.

1109
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:05,332
Sure, he was.

1110
00:59:05,332 --> 00:59:08,072
Mind pretending to be
my girlfriend for a second?

1111
00:59:08,072 --> 00:59:10,080
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

1112
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,514
I will, uh, convert my truck to biodiesel.

1113
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:15,942
- OK, I will do it.
- Ding-dong.

1114
00:59:15,942 --> 00:59:19,183
Uh, this is my girlfriend,
guys. This is Jill.

1115
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:20,952
Hello.

1116
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:22,549
She's your girlfriend?

1117
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:24,060
Yeah. Yeah.

1118
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,687
Yes, I am.

1119
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,095
- Right?
- Yup.

1120
00:59:27,095 --> 00:59:29,395
She thinks I am...

1121
00:59:29,395 --> 00:59:32,868
You want me to...
Oh. Uh... romantic.

1122
00:59:32,868 --> 00:59:34,802
She likes how romantic I can be.

1123
00:59:34,802 --> 00:59:37,899
And, uh, "great kisser,"
she likes to say.

1124
00:59:37,899 --> 00:59:41,309
Oh, yeah. That's...
a little too much.

1125
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:44,439
- Oh. Sorry.
- Wow, you are really pretty.

1126
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:46,814
- I mean, she's all right.
- Thanks.

1127
00:59:46,814 --> 00:59:49,752
I have seen hotter,
but she's pretty cool.

1128
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,152
So super skinny.

1129
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:54,851
Skinnier than you.
But... Yeah.

1130
00:59:56,227 --> 00:59:57,251
Whatever.

1131
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:59,956
I feel really awful
saying this out loud.

1132
00:59:59,956 --> 01:00:04,798
We were really terrible to Skeeter
in high school. Awful. So mean.

1133
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:06,302
My Skeeter?

1134
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,771
- They were.
- You had a hard time in high school?

1135
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:12,503
Look at you now.
You turned out pretty... cute.

1136
01:00:12,503 --> 01:00:14,135
- Yeah!
- You know...

1137
01:00:14,135 --> 01:00:17,340
the pimples went away,
and, uh, these came to play.

1138
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,849
- You want to touch them?
- Oh, that's OK.

1139
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:25,048
- Later, later.
- They're here for you. Ding-dong.

1140
01:00:26,324 --> 01:00:27,985
<i># You put your right hand in</i>

1141
01:00:27,985 --> 01:00:30,459
<i> # You put your right hand out</i>

1142
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:32,120
<i># You put your right hand in</i>

1143
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,062
<i>- # And you shake it all about
- OK.</i>

1144
01:00:34,062 --> 01:00:36,157
- I think we should leave.
- Yes.

1145
01:00:36,157 --> 01:00:38,099
<i># And you turn yourself around</i>

1146
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:40,603
<i>- All right. Bye-bye.
- # That's what it's all about #</i>

1147
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:41,934
What's happening?

1148
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:44,304
Hey, so I spoke to Wendy.

1149
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:46,275
She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.

1150
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,369
This is the longest
she's been away from them.

1151
01:00:48,369 --> 01:00:53,042
That's right.
This is my last night with the kids.

1152
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:54,914
You know,
they're going to be devastated.

1153
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:56,647
They worship you

1154
01:00:56,647 --> 01:00:59,485
and those amazing bedtime stories
you have been telling them.

1155
01:00:59,485 --> 01:01:02,321
Oh, well, they say all the good parts.
I promise.

1156
01:01:02,321 --> 01:01:04,486
Oh, my gosh.
Is he unconscious?

1157
01:01:04,486 --> 01:01:05,654
Yeah, yeah.

1158
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:10,566
Boom! Oh.

1159
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:13,400
Thanks!

1160
01:01:14,472 --> 01:01:15,632
Whoa!

1161
01:01:15,632 --> 01:01:17,572
- Yeah?
- Check out Mr. Smooth.

1162
01:01:17,572 --> 01:01:21,237
Well, you know, I do what I do.

1163
01:01:21,237 --> 01:01:23,872
- Think we should get out of this rain?
- What rain?

1164
01:01:26,551 --> 01:01:28,280
Oh, shoot!
Where did that come from?

1165
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,150
I don't know!
Isn't it amazing?

1166
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:33,349
- Let's get out of this!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!

1167
01:01:35,326 --> 01:01:37,590
I can read the future.

1168
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:42,925
Good God. So...

1169
01:01:42,925 --> 01:01:47,267
So... The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?

1170
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:50,000
I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...

1171
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,405
good luck on it anyway.

1172
01:01:51,405 --> 01:01:52,841
- Thank you.
- Yep.

1173
01:01:52,841 --> 01:01:57,245
Actually, you can come
if you want. It's like a party.

1174
01:01:57,245 --> 01:02:00,045
You know, Wendy's going to be
watching the kids,

1175
01:02:00,045 --> 01:02:01,415
and we could have fun.

1176
01:02:01,415 --> 01:02:03,113
You can meet me there.

1177
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:06,248
Yeah. That would, uh...

1178
01:02:06,248 --> 01:02:09,987
I could do that.
I could meet you, um...

1179
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:12,689
...after night school or something.

1180
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:16,692
It's you?

1181
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:18,929
It's me what?

1182
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:23,439
You're the fairest maiden in the land?

1183
01:02:25,476 --> 01:02:28,673
"Fair" as in
"doesn't cheat at checkers"?

1184
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:33,183
No, fairest as in...

1185
01:02:34,786 --> 01:02:36,811
..."beautifulest."

1186
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:49,665
Wait, wait.
Something weird's going to happen.

1187
01:02:50,735 --> 01:02:51,485
Oh.

1188
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,764
No, yeah, we don't...
This is a mistake.

1189
01:02:55,764 --> 01:02:59,776
No, no, no, not between us.
I mean like, some...

1190
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,711
No! No, no!
Oh, here comes Abe!

1191
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:04,298
No!

1192
01:03:14,192 --> 01:03:15,784
Ah! Look.

1193
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:19,286
- Wow, a penny.
- No, no, no.

1194
01:03:19,286 --> 01:03:22,458
This is the weird thing
I was talking about. Abe Lincoln.

1195
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:25,434
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

1196
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,438
Abe's not going to interrupt
this time. That was it.

1197
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:30,235
It's supposed to end better than this.

1198
01:03:30,235 --> 01:03:33,368
Stick around. I am telling you,
you're going to be missing out.

1199
01:03:35,013 --> 01:03:37,140
Nice imagination, Patrick.

1200
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:46,718
- Skeeter?
- Yo.

1201
01:03:46,718 --> 01:03:49,521
We have got a little bit
of a shaving situation in there.

1202
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:51,926
Oh, no, no, no.
I took the razor blades out.

1203
01:03:51,926 --> 01:03:53,827
Don't worry. Their father ain't around,

1204
01:03:53,827 --> 01:03:56,059
I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.

1205
01:03:57,702 --> 01:04:00,136
I am Princess Leia.

1206
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:01,899
Uh-huh.

1207
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:06,234
So, are you ready
for the big showdown tomorrow night?

1208
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:07,299
Oh, yeah.

1209
01:04:07,299 --> 01:04:08,675
What I am going to do is

1210
01:04:08,675 --> 01:04:10,680
tell them a bedtime story tonight.

1211
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,546
I will have me win in the story.

1212
01:04:13,546 --> 01:04:17,145
Then I will win for reals.
Do you dig?

1213
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,916
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.

1214
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,220
So it's like, um,
positive visualization.

1215
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,021
I read a book on that once.

1216
01:04:23,995 --> 01:04:26,293
Read the back cover, at least.

1217
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,697
I can't read.

1218
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:34,466
Shut up, Bugsy!

1219
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:37,167
I have got opposable thumbs.
How do you feel about that?

1220
01:04:39,277 --> 01:04:40,835
You children ready?

1221
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,642
Because here comes our last story.

1222
01:04:44,816 --> 01:04:47,512
The fate of the entire universe

1223
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:49,416
hung in the balance,

1224
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:51,751
as the Supreme Galactic Council

1225
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:54,257
<i>met to determine who would control</i>

1226
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:59,524
<i>the new planet in the vast
Nottinghamian star system.</i>

1227
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:05,234
<i>Most in attendance expected
Supreme Leader Barracto</i>

1228
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,500
<i>to rule in favor of General Kendallo,</i>

1229
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,406
<i>the evil governor of Hotelium.</i>

1230
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,672
<i>But there was a wild card in the mix...</i>

1231
01:05:16,814 --> 01:05:19,442
<i>... Skeeto Bronsonnian</i>

1232
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:22,543
<i>and his sidekick,
Mickey Doo Quicky Doo.</i>

1233
01:05:24,188 --> 01:05:26,088
<i>They all watched with excitement.</i>

1234
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,717
<i>Lieutenant Jilli
and her two young cadets,</i>

1235
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:32,820
<i>Aspenoff, and even
the great Captain Bugzoid.</i>

1236
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:37,425
<i> Hey, since it's outer space,
Skeeto should talk like a goofy alien.</i>

1237
01:05:37,425 --> 01:05:38,145
<i> What?</i>

1238
01:05:42,907 --> 01:05:45,808
That's disgusting.
I am not going to translate that.

1239
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,105
Silence!

1240
01:05:47,105 --> 01:05:48,577
The leader of the new planet

1241
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:51,843
shall be determined
the old-fashioned way:

1242
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:55,147
A zero-gravity fight.

1243
01:06:06,898 --> 01:06:10,197
<i> OK, now we get to the part
the crowd came to see.</i>

1244
01:06:10,197 --> 01:06:13,362
<i>Skeeto defeating Kendallo, right?</i>

1245
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:17,933
<i> I think we need
to see them battle first.</i>

1246
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:32,516
<i> Kendallo makes the first move.</i>

1247
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:45,501
<i>- Skeeto!
-  But the kids</i>

1248
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,765
<i>really want to see Skeeto
kick his butt, right?</i>

1249
01:06:56,948 --> 01:06:58,677
Wet willy.

1250
01:06:58,677 --> 01:06:59,517
Boring!

1251
01:07:01,352 --> 01:07:04,014
Uh, bring out the booger monster!

1252
01:07:08,326 --> 01:07:10,487
<i> Oh, I think I am going to be sick.</i>

1253
01:07:20,271 --> 01:07:23,866
<i> All right, have the booger
monster smack Kendallo around.</i>

1254
01:07:23,866 --> 01:07:26,341
<i> No, I think he should kiss him.</i>

1255
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:31,545
<i> Would you get
to Skeeto winning already?</i>

1256
01:07:31,545 --> 01:07:32,545
<i> OK.</i>

1257
01:07:36,687 --> 01:07:38,450
Whoa!

1258
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:48,364
Arise, Skeeto,
sharif of Nottinghamia.

1259
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:59,175
- Whoopee!
- Whoo!

1260
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,307
And that is the perfect ending

1261
01:08:04,307 --> 01:08:06,247
to our last story.

1262
01:08:06,247 --> 01:08:07,784
Thank you, children.

1263
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,444
Oh, that's not the ending.

1264
01:08:09,444 --> 01:08:11,420
Yeah. That would be too obvious.

1265
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,478
What do you mean?

1266
01:08:12,478 --> 01:08:14,148
Somebody threw a fireball at Skeeto

1267
01:08:14,148 --> 01:08:16,386
and Skeeto got incineratated.

1268
01:08:18,362 --> 01:08:20,922
- The end.
- "Incineratated"?

1269
01:08:20,922 --> 01:08:24,297
<i> You mean "incinerated"?</i>

1270
01:08:24,297 --> 01:08:27,496
No! No, no!
He can't catch on fire.

1271
01:08:27,496 --> 01:08:30,165
Yeah. I am Captain Skeeto.
I am on fire!

1272
01:08:30,165 --> 01:08:32,675
No, no, no.
The story can't end like that.

1273
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,574
What happened to a nice, happy ending?

1274
01:08:34,574 --> 01:08:37,773
You said happy endings
don't really happen.

1275
01:08:37,773 --> 01:08:39,338
We want our story to be real.

1276
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:41,647
Oh, I was just saying that.
I was stupid.

1277
01:08:41,647 --> 01:08:43,277
No, no, no, no, no.

1278
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:45,845
So, what? We're really going
to have me on fire? Hey!

1279
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:49,051
Don't fall asleep, or the story
will lock. Stop it! Wake up!

1280
01:08:49,051 --> 01:08:51,526
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

1281
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:55,063
I can't believe
Skeeter didn't tell you.

1282
01:08:55,063 --> 01:08:58,124
And I am sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hotel

1283
01:08:58,124 --> 01:09:02,070
is going up right here
where the, where the school is.

1284
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:04,039
Well, I am pretty sure...

1285
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,097
Excuse me. Yeah.

1286
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:07,303
<i> Everything's ready
for the presentation.</i>

1287
01:09:07,303 --> 01:09:08,845
<i>- Good.
- Ten-four, rubber duck.</i>

1288
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,505
Got it. Great.

1289

<i># Burn, baby, burn</i>

1295
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:37,973
OK. The good news is,
you're going to win the competition.

1296
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:40,977
The bad news is,
you're probably going to catch on fire,

1297
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:44,139
but not if you take a few precautions.

1298
01:09:45,049 --> 01:09:47,244
Oven mitts, smoke alarm.

1299
01:09:50,821 --> 01:09:51,810
Yeah.

1300
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:56,619
"Flame-resistant
Christmas tree spray." Yeah.

1301
01:09:58,162 --> 01:10:00,528
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
this will work.

1302
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:02,356
Excuse me. Sir?

1303
01:10:02,356 --> 01:10:04,264
Those are actually for Christmas trees.

1304
01:10:04,264 --> 01:10:05,393
I know. It is the season.

1305
01:10:05,393 --> 01:10:07,664
- Ow! God!
- I am so sorry.

1306
01:10:07,664 --> 01:10:09,205
It burns!

1307
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,570
Here, let me make it up to you.

1308
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:12,438
- Ow!
- It's for trees!

1309
01:10:12,438 --> 01:10:13,909
It's for trees!

1310
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,639
You're right! That hurts!

1311
01:10:16,981 --> 01:10:18,915
I am sorry about that!

1312
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:30,454
Antibacterial wipes, anybody?

1313
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:32,689
Aloha. Aloha.

1314
01:10:32,689 --> 01:10:34,196
Thank you so much.

1315
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,997
Whoa!

1316
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:42,095
Steady. Steady.

1317
01:10:47,445 --> 01:10:49,913
- Kona coffee ice cream.
- Yeah? What's the catch?

1318
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,608
You're going to light it on fire?
because I am on to you, honey.

1319
01:10:52,608 --> 01:10:54,742
No fire. It would melt.

1320
01:10:54,742 --> 01:10:57,413
Just take the ice cream
and a chill pill.

1321
01:11:07,164 --> 01:11:09,655
- Ah!
- Boo!

1322
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:12,167
- Skeeter.
- Yes.

1323
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,295
- That wasn't very nice.
- What wasn't?

1324
01:11:14,295 --> 01:11:16,839
- You pushed that man in the pool.
- No, he jumped in.

1325
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,033
Hey, you see Jill around?

1326
01:11:18,033 --> 01:11:20,975
No, I ain't, I ain't
seen Jill tonight, mate.

1327
01:11:26,016 --> 01:11:27,643
Ooh! I am cold.

1328
01:11:27,643 --> 01:11:30,312
I will get you a towel.

1329
01:11:30,312 --> 01:11:32,116
- I have got your towel.
- Oh, blimey.

1330
01:11:32,116 --> 01:11:33,850
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1331
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,922
I love you.

1332
01:11:42,266 --> 01:11:44,291
You brought me a grilled cheese
sandwich once.

1333
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,357
Yeah. I did, yes.

1334
01:11:45,357 --> 01:11:47,336
It was Monterey Jack.
It's a good cheese.

1335
01:11:50,841 --> 01:11:51,591
Ow!

1336
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,038
Skeeter, are you all right?

1337
01:11:54,038 --> 01:11:56,875
A bee stung my tongue!

1338
01:11:58,849 --> 01:12:02,842
The meeting for the exciting new hotel
will take place in the living room.

1339
01:12:02,842 --> 01:12:05,718
So I don't think you're going
to want to miss this.

1340
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:07,950
No, it's swelling up!

1341
01:12:12,263 --> 01:12:15,562
- Can I sit there, please, mate?
- Yes, of course.

1342
01:12:15,562 --> 01:12:18,033
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.

1343
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,900
Before we begin,
I would just like to say,

1344
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,633
personally, happy birthday.

1345
01:12:23,633 --> 01:12:25,231
Happy birthday.

1346
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:26,571
Happy birthday, Daddy.

1347
01:12:26,571 --> 01:12:27,975
Thank you, Kendall.

1348
01:12:27,975 --> 01:12:30,639
Yes, now, as you can see,

1349
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:33,012
I have invited some of the staff to sit in

1350
01:12:33,012 --> 01:12:36,780
to see how your ideas would
play with the "regular folk."

1351
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:39,880
- No offense.
- None taken, Barry. None taken.

1352
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:42,317
So, gentlemen,

1353
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:44,327
which of you would like to go first?

1354
01:12:46,864 --> 01:12:47,956
Fair enough.

1355
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:52,266
Mr. Nottingham,
you were absolutely right

1356
01:12:52,266 --> 01:12:55,828
when you said the rock and roll
theme was old hat.

1357
01:12:58,309 --> 01:13:01,039
Gone. Your insight, sir,

1358
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:04,171
has inspired me to,
to dig deeper,

1359
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:07,081
to find the commonality
at the heart

1360
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:08,618
of the American experience.

1361
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:10,620
I speak, of course...

1362
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,622
...of the musical theater.

1363
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:15,250
And, more specifically...

1364
01:13:16,193 --> 01:13:17,524
...Broadway!

1365
01:13:20,965 --> 01:13:22,432

Skeeter. You're up.

Are you all right, Skeeter?

1382

A bee bit my tongue.

Uh...

1389
01:15:07,001 --> 01:15:09,539
I was eating ice cream,
and suddenly a bee...

1390
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:13,064
Uh, it was on an ice cream,
and he licked it.

1391
01:15:13,064 --> 01:15:17,170
Hmm. Can you translate
Skeeter's presentation for us?

1392
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,545
- Mmm!
- Uh... Yes!

Yes, I can do that.

01:15:23,387 --> 01:15:24,979
Thank you. Ready?

1395
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:27,114
- I am ready. OK.
- Ready?

1396
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:38,665
"I spent the last week in the hotel,
the hotel where I live..."

1397
01:15:38,665 --> 01:15:41,034
With my niece and nephew.

1398
01:15:41,034 --> 01:15:43,437
"With my niece and my nephew."

1399
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:52,871
"To a kid, everything about a
hotel is strange and wonderful."

1400
01:15:54,451 --> 01:15:57,011
"Sleeping in a different bed."

1401
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:00,280
"Hanging out in the lobby."

1402
01:16:02,493 --> 01:16:04,723
"Jumping up and down on the alligator."

1403
01:16:09,867 --> 01:16:12,597
"Riding up and down in the elevator."

1404
01:16:12,597 --> 01:16:13,727
Ah!

1405
01:16:13,727 --> 01:16:15,601
Sorry. Yeah, I see now
that an alligator

1406
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:17,299
wouldn't be in that context.

1407
01:16:23,347 --> 01:16:27,750
"Some hotels try to make it seem
as much like home as possible."

1408
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:31,554
"But they're missing
the point."

1409
01:16:36,293 --> 01:16:39,956
"If you wanted to stay in a place
like home, then why not stay at home?"

1410
01:16:44,234 --> 01:16:47,761
"Our guests should experience
an escape from the everyday."

1411
01:16:52,676 --> 01:16:57,010
"And that's what I'd like to capture
in our new hotel."

1412
01:17:01,552 --> 01:17:06,114
"What every kid knows
and what every adult has forgotten."

1413
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,765
"Like my father said to me,

1414
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:20,270
your fun is only limited
by your imagination."

1415
01:17:23,307 --> 01:17:26,174
- That was beautiful.
- Yeah? All right. Settle down.

1416
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,676
Just the way it built.

1417
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:31,680
And that's it? I am sorry.
I don't understand it.

1418
01:17:33,984 --> 01:17:37,215
That... was... brilliant!

1419
01:17:37,215 --> 01:17:40,518
Congratulations, my boy.
You have just won the keys to the kingdom.

1420
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:57,101
Boogie, don't do that. Germs.

1421
01:17:59,743 --> 01:18:02,541
Congratulations. Great job.
Keep icing that tongue.

1422
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:05,047
- All right.
- Congratulations, Skeeter.

1423
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,049
- Congratulations. That was great.
- Yeah?

1424
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:10,650
That's just terrific.

1425
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:13,153
Congratulations, Skeeter.

1426
01:18:13,153 --> 01:18:16,420
All right, Kendall.
Yeah. No hard feelings, pal.

1427
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:19,485
Of course not. You deserve it.
You're a better man than me.

1428
01:18:19,485 --> 01:18:22,031
- You have an iron will.
- Yeah. That's what they say.

1429
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:25,591
I would not have the guts to tear down
the school my niece and nephew attend.

1430
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:27,637
What?

1431
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:31,768
You do know that's the site
for the new hotel?

1432
01:18:31,768 --> 01:18:33,742
What are you talking about?

1433
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:36,040
- Good show, old son.
- Oh, sir.

1434
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,311
That bee sting language was really
working for you on a sympathetic level.

1435
01:18:40,311 --> 01:18:43,012
Good, I am glad. I wanted to talk to you
about the location

1436
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:44,519
that we're building the hotel.

1437
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,749
<i> # Happy birthday to you</i>

1438
01:18:46,749 --> 01:18:50,054
<i># Happy birthday to you</i>

1439
01:18:50,054 --> 01:18:53,119
<i># Happy birthday</i>

1440
01:19:14,985 --> 01:19:18,148
Bronson, you're fired!

1441
01:19:19,523 --> 01:19:20,243
Fired?

1442
01:19:21,959 --> 01:19:23,119
Oh...

1443
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:25,218
That's how it connects.

1444
01:19:36,473 --> 01:19:37,497
Yes?

1445
01:19:37,497 --> 01:19:39,474
Do you know where
Jill Hastings' class is?

1446
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:40,874
It's right over there.

1447
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:45,279
Why won't you answer my calls?

1448
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:47,817
Because I know it's you calling.

1449
01:19:47,817 --> 01:19:50,148
You got to believe me, Jill.
I had no idea...

1450
01:19:50,148 --> 01:19:54,680
Don't destroy the sliver of respect
I have for you by making lame excuses.

1451
01:19:56,026 --> 01:20:00,156
Just go away and stay away.

1452
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:05,668
Uncle Skeeter? Do you want
to incinertate our school

1453
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:08,534
because we incinertated you in the story?

1454
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:10,869
No, I wouldn't do that.

1455
01:20:10,869 --> 01:20:13,739
We thought you were
supposed to be the good guy.

1456
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:29,022
So did I.

1457
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:51,144
"Skeeto defeats Kendallo."

1458
01:20:52,516 --> 01:20:54,450
Not really.

1459
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:58,579
- Yeah?
- Hey.

1460
01:20:58,579 --> 01:21:01,556
Oh, hey.
Welcome back.

1461
01:21:03,126 --> 01:21:04,855
So, you mad at me, too?

1462
01:21:04,855 --> 01:21:08,762
Not as mad as Jill,
but, uh, mad, yes.

1463
01:21:08,762 --> 01:21:11,460
I didn't know the new hotel
was going up there.

1464
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:13,362
I figured that.

1465
01:21:13,362 --> 01:21:14,529
Then what are you mad at?

1466
01:21:14,529 --> 01:21:16,128
I gave the kids junk food?

1467
01:21:16,128 --> 01:21:18,401
No, I figured you'd do that too.

1468
01:21:18,401 --> 01:21:21,603
I am mad because you told my kids

1469
01:21:21,603 --> 01:21:24,010
that in real life
there are no happy endings.

1470
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:26,015
Well, look around you, Wendy.

1471
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:28,210
Do you see any happy endings here?

1472
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:35,924
I don't know. You and Dad always had
so much fun in this room.

1473
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:37,653
For whatever reason, I didn't.

1474
01:21:37,653 --> 01:21:40,787
I was always the cynic,
the, the sourpuss.

1475
01:21:40,787 --> 01:21:43,662
The black cloud.
The energy drainer.

1476
01:21:43,662 --> 01:21:45,860
The... dead fish.

1477
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,564
Yes, all of those things.

1478
01:21:48,564 --> 01:21:50,663
But when I left Bobbi
and Patrick with you,

1479
01:21:50,663 --> 01:21:53,868
I guess I just was hoping
you'd rub off on them.

1480
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:58,142
Get them to be lighter.
Have fun. Enjoy themselves.

1481
01:21:59,216 --> 01:22:00,740
I thought Dad would like that.

1482
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:05,449
Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona.

1483
01:22:05,449 --> 01:22:07,752
Teaching, not principaling.

1484
01:22:07,752 --> 01:22:09,291
That's cool.

1485
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,453
Yeah, well, maybe you can come
visit when we get settled.

1486
01:22:12,453 --> 01:22:15,191
I know by then the kids
will really want to see you.

1487
01:22:21,838 --> 01:22:23,305
All right. Love you.

1488
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,704
Love you.

1489
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:34,348
<i> And so Skeeter sat on his bed,
filled with regret,</i>

1490
01:22:34,348 --> 01:22:36,783
<i>wondering how to put the pieces
of his life together</i>

1491
01:22:36,783 --> 01:22:38,878
<i>after one magical week.</i>

1492
01:22:38,878 --> 01:22:42,652
<i>- Great ending, huh?
-  That was your ending, son?</i>

1493
01:22:42,652 --> 01:22:45,957
<i>I thought this was just a sad part,
and you were about to make it better.</i>

1494
01:22:45,957 --> 01:22:47,860
What? How could I make it any better?

1495
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:50,422
<i>Well, In the stories I told you,</i>

1496
01:22:50,422 --> 01:22:52,331
<i>just when things looked bleakest,</i>

1497
01:22:52,331 --> 01:22:55,963
<i>the hero would do something
unexpected and courageous</i>

1498
01:22:55,963 --> 01:22:58,837
<i>to beat the bad guy,
save the day, and get the girl!</i>

1499
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:01,935
Yeah. How can I do that?

1500
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,604
<i>It's your story, not mine.</i>

1501
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,807
<i>But you better get moving.
Go get them, son.</i>

1502
01:23:16,793 --> 01:23:18,954
Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham?

1503
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:21,554
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a moment.

1504
01:23:21,554 --> 01:23:24,828
My name is Jill Hastings.
I am a teacher at Webster Elementary.

1505
01:23:24,828 --> 01:23:28,428
Save our school!
Save our school!

1506
01:23:28,428 --> 01:23:31,963
Save our school!
Save our school!

1507
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:33,737
Save our school!

1508
01:23:33,737 --> 01:23:35,505
Save our school!

1509
01:23:35,505 --> 01:23:38,673
My men are in position.
We are ready for the demolition.

1510
01:23:38,673 --> 01:23:40,909
Excellent.
Mr. Nottingham said he'd call

1511
01:23:40,909 --> 01:23:43,077
if he had a problem
getting the variance,

1512
01:23:43,077 --> 01:23:45,713
so if we don't hear from him
in the next 20 minutes,

1513
01:23:45,713 --> 01:23:47,814
I say we just... blow it all up.

1514
01:23:53,897 --> 01:23:57,424
Madam, the war is over.
You lost. I am sorry.

1515
01:24:01,104 --> 01:24:04,335
This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham.
We're talking about children.

1516
01:24:04,335 --> 01:24:07,433
There must be other possible
sites for your hotel complex

1517
01:24:07,433 --> 01:24:10,035
that would not result
in the displacement...

1518
01:24:10,035 --> 01:24:12,013
Hey, hey! Barry, Jill.
How you doing?

1519
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:14,983
We're just wrapping up here.
Donna, you remember Jill, right?

1520
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:19,249
Of course! Oh, my God.
That jacket is so cute!

1521
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:22,155
Uh, thank you.

1522
01:24:22,155 --> 01:24:23,715
Bronson, what are you doing here?

1523
01:24:23,715 --> 01:24:26,227
What am I doing here?
Yeah, what am I doing here?

1524
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:30,130
Oh, uh, well, Mr. Bronson,
as a concerned citizen,

1525
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:31,929
wanted to bring points to my attention

1526
01:24:31,929 --> 01:24:34,630
before I made any hasty
decisions about the property.

1527
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:38,071
And they are points that are going
to take me years to analyze.

1528
01:24:38,071 --> 01:24:40,302
- Years?
- Years.

1529
01:24:40,302 --> 01:24:43,904
Bronson, are you
playing hardball with me?

1530
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,345
I am, sir.

1531
01:24:45,345 --> 01:24:48,646
Because your application
for variance has been...

1532
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,749
Denied.

1533
01:24:53,323 --> 01:24:54,620
Denied?

1534
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:56,556
Yes. But the good news is

1535
01:24:56,556 --> 01:24:59,060
Donna and I found you
another piece of property

1536
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,997
right on the beach in Santa Monica
that is uptight and out of sight.

1537
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:05,626
Beachfront was my first choice,
but it's not for sale.

1538
01:25:05,626 --> 01:25:07,169
It is now.

1539
01:25:07,169 --> 01:25:09,467
It is! Isn't that fabulous?

1540
01:25:09,973 --> 01:25:11,065
Really?

1541
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,574
Friends?

1542
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,633
Oh, oh.
Yeah, well, germs.

1543
01:25:14,633 --> 01:25:18,238
Let's get past that.
Come here. Come here.

1544
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,682
No, no, no, no, no.

1545
01:25:21,682 --> 01:25:24,584
I am touching you,
and it's OK. Look at that.

1546
01:25:24,584 --> 01:25:26,747
Aw...

1547
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:30,657
Ooh. You're enjoying it.
Good. Bring me closer.

1548
01:25:30,657 --> 01:25:34,424
That is so sweet. And creepy.

1549
01:25:37,567 --> 01:25:39,626
Attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

1550
01:25:39,626 --> 01:25:44,072
We are working with highly-sensitive,
dangerous radio-controlled explosives.

1551
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:45,869
Boo!

1552
01:25:45,869 --> 01:25:49,878
And so to avoid any tragic misfires,

1553
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:52,414
I would ask that you all
turn off your cell phones.

1554
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:55,713
All of you, please.
Turn your cell phones off.

1555
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,379
Did you really just fix everything?

1556
01:25:59,379 --> 01:26:01,390
Not everything.

1557
01:26:04,928 --> 01:26:07,123
- Yes?
- We appear to have a situation.

1558
01:26:07,123 --> 01:26:09,165
I can't reach Kendall on his cell phone

1559
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:13,032
to halt the demolition
which will begin in... 13 minutes.

1560
01:26:13,032 --> 01:26:15,003
This sign we made
is awesome!

1561
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,131
We need a window where
those construction guys can see it.

1562
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,073
Then they will change their minds.

1563
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:23,305
Bobbi, I found one.

1564
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,415
That's my Prius!

1565
01:26:29,415 --> 01:26:31,283
- OK. Where's your truck?
- My truck?

1566
01:26:31,283 --> 01:26:33,413
I had to give it back to the hotel.

1567
01:26:33,413 --> 01:26:36,084
What do you mean
you gave it back to the hotel?

1568
01:26:36,084 --> 01:26:37,490
Come here!
Come here!

1569
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:38,210
Sorry!

1570
01:26:41,331 --> 01:26:43,196
It's for a good cause!

1571
01:26:46,035 --> 01:26:48,367
Have you ever driven a motorcycle?

1572
01:26:48,367 --> 01:26:49,117
No!

1573
01:27:20,937 --> 01:27:22,632
Oh, my God!

1574
01:27:26,309 --> 01:27:28,243
No, no, no, no!

1575
01:27:33,216 --> 01:27:34,808
Ooh! Yah! Booya!

1576
01:27:45,728 --> 01:27:48,959
Have you seen Bobbi? Patrick?

1577
01:27:48,959 --> 01:27:51,398
Bobbi! Patrick!

1578
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:55,165
What are you going to do?

1579
01:28:14,157 --> 01:28:15,852
I will take that back.

1580
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,685
No fair!

1581
01:28:19,685 --> 01:28:23,198
Hey, people, that's 60 seconds!
Whoo-hoo!

1582
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:26,167
Wait! Wait a minute!
I can't find my children!

1583
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,363
- They might be in there!
- Nice try.

1584
01:28:28,363 --> 01:28:31,271
We cleared the building hours ago. OK?
Everything is fine.

1585
01:28:33,576 --> 01:28:35,373
No! Let me through!

1586
01:28:35,373 --> 01:28:38,437
Hey, we got to check the rooms
before we start making booms.

1587
01:28:38,437 --> 01:28:40,312
We have checked it already!

1588
01:28:40,312 --> 01:28:41,611
Do it myself.

1589
01:28:43,019 --> 01:28:45,681
Uncle Skeeter!

1590
01:28:45,681 --> 01:28:48,223
Hey! Get out of there!

1591
01:28:48,223 --> 01:28:49,690
- Five...
- No!

1592
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,283
- Grab the bar!
- Four...

1593
01:28:52,529 --> 01:28:54,497
Three...

1594
01:28:55,131 --> 01:28:56,723
Two...

1595
01:28:56,723 --> 01:28:57,788
One!

1596
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:07,476
The king has issued a proclamation.

1597
01:29:08,478 --> 01:29:10,571
The hotel moves away.

1598
01:29:10,571 --> 01:29:13,047
The school will stay.

1599
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:15,346
Long live Webster Elementary!

1600
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:21,850
- Mom!
- Mom!

1601
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:23,483
Bobbi! Patrick!

1602
01:29:24,761 --> 01:29:25,955
Oh!

1603
01:29:28,464 --> 01:29:32,264
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys underdemeciated me.

1604
01:29:32,264 --> 01:29:34,963
Come here! I just got to know you guys.

1605
01:29:34,963 --> 01:29:37,506
You think I am going to let
you slip away from me now?

1606
01:29:37,506 --> 01:29:40,202
I knew you were the good guy.

1607
01:29:40,202 --> 01:29:41,675
Yeah.

1608
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:45,771
Uh, Patrick, hi.
I am Trisha Sparks.

1609
01:29:45,771 --> 01:29:49,147
I just wanted you to know that...
thanks for saving the school.

1610
01:29:51,187 --> 01:29:52,882
Western. Go Western.

1611
01:29:52,882 --> 01:29:57,620
- No thanks necessary, ma'am.
- That's my boy. That's my boy.

1612
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:01,790
There must be some way for me
to show my appreciation.

1613
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:02,640
Oh-ho-ho! Get it.

1614
01:30:08,705 --> 01:30:12,698
Ooh! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1615
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:14,436
Hey, isn't she a little old for you?

1616
01:30:14,436 --> 01:30:17,479
- She's hot.
- So is she. What do you think?

1617
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:19,344
If Master Stinky's getting a kiss,

1618
01:30:19,344 --> 01:30:22,543
shouldn't, shouldn't I get
a little mermaid action?

1619
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:24,678
- Come on, already.
- Ooh!

1620
01:30:39,035 --> 01:30:41,629
<i> Now look what my boy has done.</i>

1621
01:30:41,629 --> 01:30:44,537
<i>Turned his back on the world
of luxury hotel management</i>

1622
01:30:44,537 --> 01:30:47,599
<i>to start a small family business.</i>

1623
01:30:47,599 --> 01:30:51,841
<i>And bless his heart,
he even named it after me.</i>

1624
01:30:51,841 --> 01:30:55,213
Hey, speaking of samores,
it looks like Bugsy ate them all.

1625
01:30:57,253 --> 01:30:59,118
We're completely out of marshmallows.

1626
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:02,555
Oh, all right. Let me handle that.
Room service!

1627
01:31:04,661 --> 01:31:06,686
- Yes, sir?
- Hi, Kendall.

1628
01:31:06,686 --> 01:31:08,287
Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows.

1629
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:10,924
If you could just go get him some,
that would be great.

1630
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,592
Right on it, sir.
Anything else?

1631
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:14,762
Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh...

1632
01:31:14,762 --> 01:31:16,498
...Housekeeping?

1633
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,467
Hey, Aspen.

1634
01:31:19,467 --> 01:31:21,908
Could you just make sure
that Bugsy's cage is clean

1635
01:31:21,908 --> 01:31:23,570
before he checks out in the morning?

1636
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:26,513
His marshmallows don't agree with him,
there's going to be a mess.

1637
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:31,348
All right.

1638
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:34,186
OK, bye, guys.

1639
01:31:34,186 --> 01:31:36,589
<i> I think Bugsy
is trying to tell us</i>

1640
01:31:36,589 --> 01:31:38,627
<i>that our tale has reached its end.</i>

1641
01:31:38,627 --> 01:31:40,424
<i>But before I go, let me tell you</i>

1642
01:31:40,424 --> 01:31:42,896
<i>what our heroes and villains
are doing now.</i>

1643
01:31:42,896 --> 01:31:44,865
<i>My old friend, Barry Nottingham,</i>

1644
01:31:44,865 --> 01:31:47,494
<i>overcame his fear of germs
to such a degree</i>

1645
01:31:47,494 --> 01:31:49,902
<i>that he decided to leave
the hotel business</i>

1646
01:31:49,902 --> 01:31:52,566
<i>and enter the field of medicine.</i>

1647
01:31:52,566 --> 01:31:56,942
<i>He is currently the school nurse
at Webster Elementary.</i>

1648
01:31:56,942 --> 01:31:59,277
<i>Violet now runs the hotel empire,</i>

1649
01:31:59,277 --> 01:32:01,748
<i>along with her husband, Mickey,</i>

1650
01:32:01,748 --> 01:32:03,877
<i>the former room service waiter</i>

1651
01:32:03,877 --> 01:32:06,786
<i>who is now the ninth-richest
person in the world.</i>

1652
01:32:07,924 --> 01:32:09,858
<i>And Skeeter and Jill?</i>

1653
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:13,362
<i>After the double wedding of the century,</i>

1654
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:18,059
<i>they lived... well, happily ever after,</i>

1655
01:32:18,059 --> 01:32:19,897
<i>running Marty's Motel</i>

1656
01:32:19,897 --> 01:32:23,200
<i>and spending a lot of time
with my grandkids,</i>

1657
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:26,036
<i>whose adventures have just begun.</i>

1658
01:32:26,036 --> 01:32:30,136
<i>Though, not everyone
is quite so excited.</i>

1659
01:32:30,136 --> 01:32:33,011
<i>But that is a whole other story.</i>

1660
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:34,879
<i>The end.</i>

1661
01:32:37,353 --> 01:32:39,583
