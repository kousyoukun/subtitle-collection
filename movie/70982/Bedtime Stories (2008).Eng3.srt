1
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,470
I'm going to tell you a story now,

2
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,040
But as any good storyteller knows,

3
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,710
one must first be sure
the audience is prepared,

4
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,190
Is everybody comfortably seated?

5
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,520
Does anyone need to use the bathroom?

6
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,690
Oh, You, sir, in the back?

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,660
Well, hold it in,

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,630
You ready? Here we go,

9
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,470
My name is Marty Bronson,

10
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,530
I owned and operated
the Sunny Vista Motel,

11
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,240
which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,380
in Los Angeles, California,
in the year 1974,

13
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,980
The motel was my labor of love,

14
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,890
and I ran it with the help
of my children: Wendy,,,

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,160
Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,490
Thank you.

17
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,690
And Skeeter,

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,270
May I help you with your bags,
Mr. and Mrs. Dixon?

19
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,810
-Yes, please.
-Why, thank you, young man.

20
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,710
You, uh, need a hand?

21
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,550
No, no. I got it.

22
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,950
[Mr. Dixon] OK.

23
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,520
To my boy Skeeter,
the motel was a wonderland,

24
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,250
Way too hyper.

25
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,890
The galaxy's not big enough
for the both of us.

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,450
A magical place,

27
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,000
Full of new adventures
for a six-year-old boy,

28
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,670
[laughs] Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

29
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,080
Skeeter loved the old place
as much as I did,

30
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,590
And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better,

31
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,950
I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.

32
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,860
I was thinking we could put
an extra pair of socks in each room

33
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,660
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

34
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,160
That's a good idea.

35
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,630
Time for bed,
I'm meeting with Mr. Nottingham.

36
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,300
Wait, Dad. I'm not even tired.

37
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,770
Well, how about a bedtime story?

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,170
Yay!

39
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,850
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,550
and that little boy's name
was Skeeter.

41
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,350
Well, I could tell a pretty fair tale
when the muse was with me,

42
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,720
And making my little boy smile,

43
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,230
now, that was truly magical,

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,230
Yeah, I was a pretty good dad
and a pretty good host,

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,670
But unfortunately,
a pretty bad businessman,

46
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,640
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,180
This motel is sinking in red ink...

48
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,540
and I'm offering you the last lifeboat.

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,110
I don't know.

50
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,350
[Nottingham]
I've seen the books, Martin.

51
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,580
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

52
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,450
Yes, well, I...

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,720
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

54
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,460
[Nottingham] How about this?

55
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,830
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

56
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,890
I'll let him run this place.

57
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,600
[sighs] You promise?

58
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,940
Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.

59
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,580
That's my boy, Bronson.

60
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,310
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

61
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,320
It's going to be uptight
and out of sight.

62
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,190
And just like that,
our modest little Sunny Vista Motel,,,

63
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,030
,,,metamorphosized into the
mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham,

64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,540
And for the past 25 years,

65
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,010
it has been lovingly maintained
by my now grown-up son,

66
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,910
Skeeter Bronson, the handyman,

67
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,280
Yes, though Mr, Nottingham's promise
for Skeeter to run the place

68
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,870
-seems to have been forgotten,,,
-Hiya, Pop.

69
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,550
,,,my boy always works diligently
with a hopeful heart,

70
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,490
still waiting for his shot,

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,420
Mrs. Dixon?
Is there a problem with her room?

72
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,190
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

73
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,860
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

74
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,260
and doesn't want to pay for it.

75
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,330
I never even touched
that evil little refrigerator.

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,300
I don't drink alcohol.

77
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,310
Of course.
There's probably a mix-up.

78
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,740
-I saw who took it.
-OK.

79
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,940
He had red hair and a beard.

80
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,500
He was wearing a green suit
with brass buttons.

81
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,010
And he stands about ten inches tall.

82
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,680
So we're talking about a leprechaun?

83
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,780
There you go.

84
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,320
Oh, I didn't know your brother
was in town.

85
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,620
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

86
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,130
Put all the missing bottles
on my tab.

87
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,930
Next time you see any leprechauns,
we'll tell Aspen.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,060
She's half-troll.

89
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,600
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

90
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,670
She would.

91
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,810
Today magic is
in the air at the grand hotel,

92
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,400
and the winds of change
are about to blow our story

93
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,780
in a strange new direction,

94
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,780
But what would you expect in a hotel

95
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,820
founded by someone who loved
a good story as much as I?

96
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,180
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.

97
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,990
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

98
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,390
Of course.

99
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,450
-You fixed it?
-Let me see here.

100
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,830
-[feedback]
-Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

101
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,890
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

102
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,560
-Whoa, whoa.
-Skeeter.

103
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,700
I say "Barry,"
you say "Nottingham."

104
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,500
-Barry.
-[all] Nottingham.

105
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,130
-Barry.
-[all] Nottingham.

106
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,340
# Barry had a Nottingham

107
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,680
# Nottingham, Nottingham

108
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,480
# Barry had a Nottingham

109
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,210
# Whose beard was
white as snow #

110
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,150
[laughs] Come on,
give it up for the big man.

111
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,150
Got them warmed up for you, sir.

112
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,590
-It's good to see you again.
-Germs.

113
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,680
-Germs?
-Uh, Skeeter,

114
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,890
Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,330
Not a fear, an awareness...

116
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,990
...of germs and
how dangerous they can be

117
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,400
when not properly...feared, so...

118
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,870
You're doing the right thing.
I didn't shower today.

119
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,700
So, yeah, let me get out of here.

120
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,440
[Skeeter] Barry Nottingham, everybody.

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,050
-He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
-[Barry] Welcome.

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,080
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

123
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,210
But it's no secret that this one,

124
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,490
the Sunny Vista Nottingham,
is my favorite.

125
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,500
However, this is a 20th-century hotel.

126
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,770
We need something for the 21 st century.

127
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,240
And so, we have decided
to close this hotel

128
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,340
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

129
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,480
This will be the largest hotel
on the West Coast.

130
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,150
I simply don't understand what the fuss
is about. It's just a big building.

131
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,990
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

132
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,720
...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

133
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,330
Yes!

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,300
So I'm proud to announce
the new hotel's general manager.

135
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,430
He's been waiting on this
for a long time.

136
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,640
We all know how hard he works,
how intelligent he is,

137
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,150
how much this hotel means to him.

138
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,310
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!

139
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,650
Take a bow, Kendall.

140
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,950
-God bless.
-Boo!

141
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,190
[man] A beautiful speech, sir.
A beautiful speech.

142
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,250
I'm so glad you could come.

143
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,130
It's great to see you.

144
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,630
Don't touch me.

145
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,030
Well done, Daddy.

146
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,340
Oh, oh, hello there.
Do you know my daughter, Violet?

147
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,340
Only by reputation, sir.

148
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,100
Excuse me?

149
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,980
No, no, not that she has a reputation.

150
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,510
I always heard she's very hot.

151
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,150
Not hot as in hot.

152
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,190
Hot, I meant warm...
Warm-hearted.

153
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,150
And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,

154
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,450
in bars, with a lot
of different guys, and...

155
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,500
That's the old Violet Nottingham.
Before she met me.

156
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,290
Now it's up to me to keep
my pooky-bear out of the spotlight

157
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,960
and nightclubs and tabloids.
lsn't that right, sir? [chuckles]

158
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,970
Violet's off to her private tennis
lesson with Roger Federer.

159
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,700
-Oh. All right, good for you.
-Bye, boys.

160
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,440
Got to say, uh...

161
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,070
...it's gonna be hard for me to see
the hotel move locations like this.

162
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,580
Well, l, I do hope you'll feel able
to come and work with us there.

163
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,680
Big as Kendall wants to make it,

164
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,520
well, there's going to be a lot
of light bulbs to change.

165
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,990
Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?

166
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,550
There is, sir. Come this way.
I'll get you some.

167
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,390
Can't be too careful, Kendall.

168
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,840
[# Ray Anthony and His Orchestra:
The Hokey Pokey]

169
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,270
All right, everyone finished
at the pottery table,

170
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,870
bring their art to the kiln.

171
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,540
The man with the rescue donkey's
leaving in five minutes,

172
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,340
if you haven't gotten a ride, hurry up.

173
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,640
Thank you, Principal Duva.

174
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,190
Oh, I'm not a principal
at this party. I'm a mom.

175
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,780
Hey!

176
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,120
I notice no one's eating
the gluten-free wheatgrass cake.

177
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,650
Come on. Trust me,
you just got to get past the smell.

178
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,970
What? The clown died?

179
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,730
-What's in that bag?
-Oh, chocolate chip cookie.

180
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,930
-Food!
-[all kids] Food!

181
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,880
-Slow it down, slow it down.
-Hey, sissy.

182
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,010
Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled
crud to my house every time you visit?

183
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,110
What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.

184
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,620
What are you talking about?
It hasn't been four years.

185
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,780
You were here for
The Fourth of July barbecue

186
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,150
when you punched my husband?

187
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,990
Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,

188
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,790
but his underwear had holes in it.

189
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,660
I knew he'd be your ex-husband.
You should be happy.

190
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,100
All right. Let's not start.

191
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,760
How are the kids handling

192
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,270
the old divorce anyways?

193
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,400
They're both kind of off right now.
Bobbi's been really quiet.

194
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,960
Why don't you go say hi.
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy.

195
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,600
-Is that what stinks in here?
-No, it's the cake.

196
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,440
What did she make, donkey cake?

197
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,610
-[kids laugh]
-I smell manure.

198
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,380
Hey, you guys. Remember me?

199
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,850
Uncle Skeeter.

200
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,360
Man, you got big.
Haven't seen you in a while.

201
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,090
Happy birthday there, Bobbi.

202
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,630
I'm Patrick. She's Bobbi.

203
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,360
Oh, my bad.

204
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,530
Got you a little something.
Happy birthday, Bobbi.

205
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,160
Here you go.
Picked it up at the hotel.

206
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
How's school going?

207
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,770
-Skeeter?
-Yeah.

208
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,370
Getting called to the principal's
office. Look at that.

209
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,500
Have fun with the gifts. And...

210
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,940
Yes, yes.

211
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,280
Shampoo?

212
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,080
And a soap?

213
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,150
Hanger and a towel.

214
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,250
Do not talk about school with them.

215
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,620
What's going on with the school?

216
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,720
-They're closing it down.
-No.

217
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,430
-I'm getting laid off.
-You?

218
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,970
You're like
the classic school principal.

219
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,660
I mean, you're, you're scary
and bad with people.

220
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,330
Children are nervous around you.

221
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,810
That doesn't sound right, but,
I'm just saying, what else could you do?

222
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,680
Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the bogeyman.
You could be the bogeyman.

223
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,410
-Anyway...
-What, what?

224
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,510
I've got some interviews
set up in Arizona,

225
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,110
which is kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

226
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,650
Uh-oh.

227
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,320
I need you to watch the kids...
for a week.

228
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,330
No! No, they don't even like me!

229
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,230
It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter.

230
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,200
My friend Jill
is a teacher at my school.

231
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,500
She'll bring the kids in with her
and watch them till dinnertime.

232
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,200
All you gotta do is the night shift.

233
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,930
Why can't your stupid friend do that?

234
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,740
She's got night school. Skeeter!

235
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,300
My husband left me.
I'm getting laid off.

236
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,440
l, I have to move.
I need your help.

237
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,110
So you need me.
This is good.

238
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,480
I'll do it.

239
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,250
But you got to say,

240
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,290
"Skeeter is the coolest.
I am a nerd."

241
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,220
"Skeeter's the coolest.
I'm a nerd?"

242
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,450
Yeah, you are! Whoo!

243
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,820
OK. Hey, you guys.

244
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,160
I'm going to hang out with you
this week. All right?

245
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,030
Maybe we can go...fishing.

246
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,970
I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.

247
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,370
OK, we'll stay inside.

248
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,460
How about, uh,
we play some poker?

249
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,700
-I can teach you that.
-Gambling? I don't think so.

250
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,300
OK, how about we
just take walks in the park

251
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,470
-and catalog plant species?
-Now you're talking.

252
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,210
I don't know anything about plants

253
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,220
except you try to make cakes
out of them!

254
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,410
He liked that one.
I'm gonna end with a laugh.

255
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,650
Give me some. Huh?

256
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,620
I wasn't gonna hit you.
I was trying to do the fist thing.

257
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,420
You don't know the fist thing?

258
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,960
OK, I was just...

259
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,420
That's what, uh, the children do.

260
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,500
Hey, yeh, yeh.

261
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,310
Oh, this your truck, chief?

262
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,070
Yes, it is, ma'am.

263
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,630
You realize you're taking up
two parking spaces?

264
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,410
It's a big truck, ma'am.

265
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,180
It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.

266
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,270
I had to park
all the way down the block.

267
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,180
Well, next time park in that box.
Plenty of room in there.

268
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,350
Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,

269
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,520
this is the hotel I work for's truck.

270
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,650
So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.

271
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,600
So two parking spaces
provides me with what I call

272
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,100
"a cushion of protection."

273
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,160
Wait, a hotel? Oh, wait.
You're Wendy's brother.

274
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,210
-Yeah.
-I'm Jill.

275
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,610
-Who's that?
-I'm her friend,

276
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,480
the one helping take care of the kids.
I'm the day shift.

277
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,280
OK, June. You plan on being
this hostile the whole time?

278
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,150
Jill. My name is Jill.

279
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,810
Do you plan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?

280
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,590
Oh, haven't you heard?
Goofy's the new handsome.

281
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,860
-That sounds good for the environment.
-Oh, we can't all have Priuses.

282
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,340
How do you know I drive a Prius?

283
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,340
Your whole aura reads Prius.

284
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,500
Anyways, you're in my
cushion of protection right now.

285
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,610
I want to back up, so if you
could just zing-zang up there,

286
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,550
-that would be helpful.
-Yeah.

287
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,810
You might want some Cinnabons.
You'll need it.

288
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,980
-Food!
-[kids shouting]

289
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,360
Give it back!
Somebody owes me six bucks!

290
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,130
So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hotel?

291
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,500
He promised your dad.

292
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,930
I wanted to.
It just wasn't the right time.

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,370
Let me tell you how it works.

294
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,200
The big man's giving the job
to Kendall

295
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,830
because he's dating his daughter.

296
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,070
That's the way it works,
keep it in the family.

297
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,910
He gets the girl, he gets the job,
he gets everything.

298
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,240
And I get nothing.

299
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,680
-Hello?
-[Jill] Where are you? Still there?

300
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,420
I'm still where?
Who's this?

301
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,520
Look, I've got to get to class,
The kids are waiting for you, OK?

302
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,690
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,530
[stammers] I forgot.
I'll be there in like 20 minutes.

304
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,830
I'm gonna baby-sit
my nephew and niece tonight.

305
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,530
Oh, God.
Got any advice for me?

306
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,200
Yes, I do. Sometimes I baby-sit
my cousins, right?

307
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,510
And what I do is
I let them style me hair.

308
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,810
Like put beads into it and braid it,
make me look all real sexy.

309
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,080
Like Milli Vanilli, stuff like that.
You should try that.

310
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,050
Braid my hair? That's a good idea.
Can I have some French fries?

311
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,750
Of course you can.
You're my best friend.

312
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,120
Ah! Actually, I really like
ketchup on my face

313
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,130
because it's
rejuvenating for the skin.

314
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,690
So who's the real victim?
You are.

315
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,430
Mmm! Delicious.

316
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,400
Do you think these signs will help?

317
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
Well, miracles happen,
you know?

318
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,110
You mean like Dad coming back?

319
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,510
Um...

320
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,610
[laughing] Hey!
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,620
So, um, their pajamas
are on their beds,

322
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,250
and I will be back, um,
at 8:30 to pick them up, OK?

323
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,090
-All right.
-Here is my cell phone number.

324
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,690
And call me if there's
any emergencies.

325
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,570
All right. Have fun at night school.

326
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,660
-[Jill] Bye, guys.
-Bye.

327
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,900
All packed up here.

328
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,340
I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.

329
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,810
Some clean underwear.

330
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,980
Well, maybe not that clean.

331
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,480
You guys want to watch TV?

332
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,450
We don't have a TV.

333
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,780
-Hello?
-[Skeeter] Emergency!

334
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,060
They don't have a TV.

335
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,560
Wendy doesn't let them watch TV.
You didn't know?

336
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,620
I don't know a lot of things
about these kids.

337
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,400
I wasn't allowed over here.
Their old man didn't like me.

338
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,560
OK, listen, you don't need a TV.
You can, um, play a game, do a puzzle.

339
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,900
I'm sure you can figure
something out. OK?

340
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let them
braid my hair or something?

341
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,440
Would they like that?

342
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,780
I don't think anyone
should touch that hair.

343
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,020
Hey, what do you say we go...

344
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,530
next door and toilet paper
your neighbor's trees?

345
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,490
No? OK, bedtime!

346
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,270
OK, so you guys cool?

347
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,830
You have to read us a bedtime story.

348
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,280
Yeah, all right. You have any?

349
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,080
Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?

350
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,210
"Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"?

351
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,450
Mmm, no.

352
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,890
"The Organic Squirrel
Gets a Bike Helmet"?

353
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,490
I'm not reading these
communist books to you guys.

354
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,090
Don't you got any real stories?

355
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,470
-Like what?
-Like what?

356
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,970
Like, like cowboys? Or dragons?

357
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,270
Or aliens? Or...What the heck
is on my head right now?

358
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,470
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.

359
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,480
-Why do you call him Bugsy?
-Because of his eyes.

360
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,280
Let me see them.

361
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,150
Wow! Those eyes would be big on a cow.

362
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,460
Are those eyeballs
or bowling balls?

363
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,500
Can't keep my eyes off of them.

364
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,160
Just get in there so I don't have to
look at them anymore. Goodbye.

365
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,860
Anyways, uh,

366
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,700
you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?

367
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,710
Like, like my old man used to do for me?

368
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,300
Maybe I could be good at this.

369
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,810
All right, um...

370
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,070
Here goes.

371
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,650
Once upon a time,
in a magical, faraway kingdom...

372
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,350
Once upon a time,
in a magical, faraway kingdom...

373
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,120
,,,there was a brave
and noble knight,

374
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,130
Strikingly handsome,

375
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,990
Who lived in a grand castle

376
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,590
that weary travelers from near and far
would come and visit,

377
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,660
Now, this knight had been
working his butt off for years,

378
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,540
You'd think he'd be a shoo-in
to rule the castle, right?

379
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,700
-[Patrick] Right,
-[Skeeter] Wrong,

380
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,770
Actually, he wasn't
even a knight at all,

381
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,050
Oh, no.

382
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,380
[Skeeter] He was, in fact,
just a lowly peasant,

383
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,690
And even though he was the son
of the late, great Lord Marty,,,

384
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,460
-[indistinct]
-Thank you.

385
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,590
,,,and knew everything there is
to know about running a castle,

386
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,640
everyone just took him for granted,

387
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,730
His name was Mr, Underappreciated,

388
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,740
What's "underdemeciated"?

389
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,570
-Under de-what?
-Underdemeciated.

390
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,880
That's right,
I forgot you were six.

391
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,250
His name was Sir...Fix-A-Lot.

392
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,290
But alas, the kingdom
where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived

393
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,520
did not place much value on dedication
or hard work, I guess,

394
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:19,120
Because the superstar in all
the land was Sir Butt-Kiss,

395
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,070
And he spent all his days
kissing everybody's butt,

396
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,770
-Boo!
-[giggles]

397
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,330
And my lord, yes, of course I can get you

398
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,600
front row house seats to The Lion King,

399
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,510
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had
a best friend, Friar Fred,

400
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,510
who was not right in the head.

401
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,950
She never! No! Not our queen,
I won't have that.

402
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,750
-Were there any kids in the kingdom?
-[Skeeter] Yes, yes. Of course.

403
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,790
There were two young pages,

404
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,420
Mistress Stinky
and Master Smelly.

405
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,360
Hey-oh! And don't forget...

406
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,870
Jillian! The queen of the fairies!

407
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,670
[Skeeter] Queen of the fairies?

408
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,040
I mean, if she has to be there,
let's just make her an angry raven,

409
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,750
Parking spot!

410
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,080
[Patrick] She should be
a mermaid teacher,

411
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,710
[Bobbi] Yeah, The best
mermaid teacher in the world,

412
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,410
Children, open your books to page 16.

413
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,920
Yes, Miss Mermaid.

414
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,250
Let's begin.

415
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,590
All right, she's a mermaid.
Whatever you want.

416
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,130
Anyways, back to the story.

417
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,360
One day the king invited
all his subjects to the castle.

418
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,260
I bring glad tidings.

419
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,890
For on this day
I have chosen a champion

420
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,030
who will run this castle

421
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,510
and be my closest advisor
and bestest buddy.

422
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,310
My new champion is...

423
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,740
...Sir Butt-Kiss!

424
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,290
Thank you.

425
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,690
Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot had been passed over.

426
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,060
So, Sir Fix-A-Lot
moved into a giant shoe,

427
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,660
got a bad case of athlete's face,

428
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,930
dove into a moat,,,

429
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,970
Ah, what the heck.
[shouts]

430
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,770
,,,and got eaten by crocodiles,

431
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,110
The end.

432
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,440
The end? That can't be the end.

433
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,780
-Why? Why not?
-It's not happy.

434
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,380
There aren't happy endings in real life.
Sooner you know that, the better.

435
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,190
-It's not fair!
-What? What's not fair?

436
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,320
I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at least get a shot to be champion?

437
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,800
-A shot? Hmm... -If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better than Sir Butt-Kiss,

438
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,840
he should get a chance to prove it.

439
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,340
OK. Yeah, yeah,
Bobbi, good.

440
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,200
[Bobbi] What the king
really said was...

441
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,710
On second thought,

442
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,840
there is another worthy man
in my kingdom,

443
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,400
and it wouldn't be fair
unless he got a shot, too.

444
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,380
Sir Fix-A-Lot!

445
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,510
[Skeeter] And then the crowd went nuts,

446
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,420
But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot
is as common as muck.

447
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,690
Boo!

448
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,730
[Skeeter] And Friar Fred
drop-kicked a booing goblin,

449
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,670
-Boo!
-[man shouts]

450
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,800
And the mermaid teacher did one of those
weird tail dolphin moves.

451
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,100
And Stinky and Smelly
did the fastest lrish jig ever.

452
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,240
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

453
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,940
[laughs] Yeah. Right on.

454
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,280
Prince Bugsy busted out
some fancy moves,

455
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,290
And then...and then...

456
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,350
It started raining gumballs.

457
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,590
Raining gumballs?

458
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,790
Why not? It's a bedtime story.
Anything can happen.

459
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,890
Yeah, yeah.
I guess in a story.

460
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,270
I just wish it was like that
in real life. I really do.

461
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,630
-What was that?
-Bugsy.

462
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,700
-[chitters]
-[Skeeter] Oh.

463
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,440
He rings that bell when he's hungry?

464
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,810
No, when he needs to go to sleep.

465
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,020
OK. As you wish,
Your Highness.

466
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,930
All right, you guys, have a good sleep.
You, too, uh, weird eyes.

467
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,310
[Skeeter] Well, I don't
have much to work with,

468
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,510
but I will make us

469
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,780
a delicious breakfast

470
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,450
that I know you will enjoy.

471
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,550
Yes, some banana
on the rice cake,

472
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,180
and then what do we call this?
Wheat germ.

473
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,960
I was told germs are bad for you,
but here goes.

474
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,200
I like it.

475
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,860
A rice cake-banana-wheat germ sandwich.

476
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,460
And what do we got?

477
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,700
This is terrible.

478
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,180
Doesn't your, your mother
have taste buds?

479
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,010
What are we doing here?
We got nothing to use in this house.

480
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,670
Hang on.

481
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,120
A little flavor.

482
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,150
It's good because, now we don't
have to brush our teeth.

483
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,820
There you go. At least we got
a little mint going on. Guys want one?

484
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,900
-[cell phone rings]
-Hang on.

485
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,300
-[ringtone screeches]
-Hello!

486
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,000
Bronson? The television set
in Mr. Nottingham's room

487
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,200
is broken and it needs
to be fixed right away.

488
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,370
I have a situation here.
I'm watching my nephew and my niece.

489
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,880
I'm sorry. Are you having
difficulty hearing me?

490
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,480
Mr. Nottingham wants
to watch television now!

491
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,990
I hear you.
I speak trollinese, don't worry.

492
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,990
-There's a leprechaun behind you,
-[squeals]

493
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,790
-Gotcha.
-[phone beeps off]

494
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,230
Thanks a lot, gentlemen. OK.

495
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,660
-Wow.
-It's pretty, huh?

496
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,720
Whoa!

497
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,760
I got to go fix my boss' television set,
but I need somebody to watch you two.

498
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,570
[paparazzo] Violet!
Right here. Give a smile.

499
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,010
Hang on.

500
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,710
Violet! Skeeter Bronson,
the handyman from the other day.

501
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,510
Oh, right. Yes.

502
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,880
Listen, uh, I got some kids
with me right now.

503
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,440
My nephew and niece. But,
I gotta fix your father's TV.

504
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,180
Could you watch them a few minutes?

505
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,620
Huh?

506
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,420
-Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going.
-[gasps]

507
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,290
-[knocking]
-[Barry] Come in.

508
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,760
-[Skeeter] Mr. Nottingham, sir?
-[Barry] Uh, the telly won't turn on.

509
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,400
[Skeeter] It won't? Well, let me just
take a...tallyho at it, OK?

510
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,240
I'll just flip this light on.

511
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,900
No, no, no, no!
Absolutely not!

512
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,450
I'm fighting a cold here.

513
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,850
I must stay in the dark
whenever possible.

514
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,410
Do you realize

515
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,390
germs can reproduce
80 percent faster in bright light?

516
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,290
Oh, OK. Here we go,
nice and dark again.

517
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,720
-The germs are confused.
-Come towards me.

518
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,590
OK. It's got to be
around here somewhere.

519
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,460
[Barry] For heaven's sake.

520
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,970
I'm so sorry, sir.
I just can't see a thing.

521
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,230
-To your left, there.
-Oh!

522
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,800
[Skeeter] There's the TV. So how's the,
uh, new hotel coming, sir?

523
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,900
Oh, very well. Still dealing with the
city on building permits and whatnot.

524
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,450
Uh-huh.

525
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,240
I can't tell you the secret theme.

526
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,680
It's so good, we don't want
anyone to steal it.

527
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,690
-I hear you, sir.
-OK, I'll tell you.

528
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,780
Come along, sit down. Please.

529
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,190
Great.

530
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,820
[Barry] Ready?

531
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,720
Rock and roll.

532
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,790
Vintage vinyl.
Music memorabilia in the lobby.

533
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,100
Oh, OK. Like, uh, like the Hard Rock?

534
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,940
-The What What?
-The Hard Rock Hotel.

535
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,000
They've been using
that theme for, like, years.

536
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,010
Get Kendall Duncan
up here straightaway, please.

537
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,310
[Violet] What a perfect
little powder puff.

538
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,310
Thank you.

539
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,880
So, Patrick, truth or dare?

540
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,190
Truth?

541
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,390
How old were you the first time
you kissed a girl?

542
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,530
Patrick never kissed a girl.

543
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,570
Girls are bis-crusting.

544
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,300
Except for Trisha Sparks.

545
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,210
Ooh, is that a girI in your class,
you little Romeo?

546
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,400
[Jill] Hey, guys.

547
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,840
Hi, Aunt Jill, did you
get the note we left you?

548
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,740
Yes, I did.

549
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,720
And, uh, now we have to get you guys
ready for school. So, come on.

550
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,750
-Hi.
-Hi.

551
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,890
Oh, hey. You're, uh...

552
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,420
-Uh-huh. Here's your fat mouse.
-It's a guinea pig, but...

553
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,620
And you, young man...

554
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,470
I want to hear all about this little
Trisha Sparks next time I see you.

555
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,860
Trisha Sparks is
two years older than you.

556
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,310
She's hot.

557
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,440
I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall.
We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.

558
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,790
This rock and roll idea
of yours is old hat.

559
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,420
Well, sir, I had every intention
of putting our own spin on it.

560
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,790
Do you know what, Skeeter?

561
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,490
I'm starting to get a fuzzy recollection

562
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,690
of something I said to your father.

563
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:20,640
In fact, I am going to give you a shot.

564
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,880
If you can come up with a better theme
than Kendall does,

565
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,140
I'll let you run the new place instead.

566
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,480
[Kendall laughs] Oh, sir.

567
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,480
Don't you think this is perhaps
a little too much of a cruel joke

568
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,710
to be playing on somebody as...
well, the, the maintenance guy?

569
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,050
-No, I don't.
-[Kendall] No.

570
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,960
Mr. Bronson has been working
for this company for 25 years.

571
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,430
I'm beginning to think I may have
seriously underdemeciated him.

572
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,800
[Kendall] I'm sorry.
"Underdemeciated"?

573
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:56,270
Precisely. You can both present your
ideas at my birthday party this weekend.

574
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,810
Thank you, Kendall.
That is all.

575
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,310
Mr. Bronson, the television,
if you would.

576
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,310
Oh, and do watch out
for the germ vaporizer.

577
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,410
[Skeeter] The best day of my life!

578
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,750
[Skeeter sings with radio]
# Amadeus Amadeus

579
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,790
# Amadeus Ow! Amadeus
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

580
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,830
# Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus

581
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,300
# Ooh, rock me Amadeus

582
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,130
-# Amadeus Amadeus
-[engine revs]

583
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,200
Whoa. I like your car, pal.

584
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,210
Hey, thanks, champ.
You know what they say.

585
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,610
You want to be the best,
you got to drive the best.

586
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,440
Hey, uh, not to get personal,

587
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,170
but what's a sweet ride
like that cost, anyways?

588
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,940
You know what? Actually it's
surprisingly affordable.

589
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,010
Yeah?

590
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,210
If you saved every paycheck you
earn for the rest of your life

591
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,620
and then multiply it by ten, you
could probably buy my muffler.

592
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,790
Ah-ooga!

593
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,230
Oh, you wanna drag race, do you?

594
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,730
You win! Good job.

595
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,050
What?

596
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,810
This is spooky.

597
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,330
You've got to be kidding me!
Look at this. I'm losing all my candy.

598
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,360
How can you not see
a 50-foot trailer? Come on.

599
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,310
So you have to compete for your job with
Skeeter Bronson. You'll annihilate him.

600
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,370
Oh, I know. It's just
a little degrading, that's all.

601
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,420
Thanks for being there.

602
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,790
I'll be there as long as
there's a there to be at.

603
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,760
Oh, hello, children.

604
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,890
We're looking for Skeeter Bronson.

605
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,160
-[Kendall groans]
-Oh, Mr. Bronson.

606
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,430
Yes, you'll find him in room 109.

607
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,600
-OK.
-Please, this way.

608
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,450
-Oh, my God! Did you see that thing?
-Those eyes.

609
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,450
They were, they were staring
into my, my very soul.

610
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,920
-Hey, Uncle Skeeter!
-Hey!

611
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,450
-Just who I wanted to see.
-Hey, chief, here's Bugsy.

612
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,160
-Got him.
-Why do they have to stay here?

613
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,200
Because I'm on call tonight,
Jennifer.

614
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,530
It's Jill, actually, Scooter.

615
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,930
It is? OK, yeah...

616
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,840
You did not just do that.

617
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,640
I did. Watch.
I'm gonna do it again.

618
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,540
So, guys, anything weird
happen to you today?

619
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,810
I had a substitute teacher
with an eye patch.

620
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,910
Uh...that's a little weird.
I'm talking like big-time weird.

621
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,420
Maybe coincidence weird, uh...

622
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,390
...as in gumball weird?

623
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,290
We're not allowed to chew gum.

624
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,730
Of course you're not.
You guys want to go to sleep?

625
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,320
It's only 5:30.

626
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,830
And we haven't had dinner.

627
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,870
Hmm. OK.

628
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,200
Room service!

629
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,140
[man] So you've never
been skateboarding?

630
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,730
You've never played video games?

631
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,010
Mom says they rot your brain.

632
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,450
That's not true. I've been playing video
games my whole life, and look at me.

633
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,240
Yeah, maybe she's got a point.

634
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,880
You. You've never eaten bacon?

635
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,860
What's bacon?

636
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,900
Bacon is the juicy,
fatty part of the pig

637
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,160
right adjacent to the rear.

638
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:19,100
But delicious and tasty,
not how I just made it sound.

639
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,830
And this is the first hamburger
you've ever eaten?

640
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,100
-What's the verdict? What do you think?
-Life-changing.

641
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,540
-Mom's gonna kill us.
-No, she isn't.

642
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,080
First of all, she's never
gonna find out about this.

643
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,350
And second of all, she used to eat
plenty of hamburgers

644
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,510
when we were growing up
in this very room.

645
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,920
[both] She did?

646
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,150
Looks like Bugsy's eaten a lot
of burgers in the last ten minutes.

647
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,120
Wow!

648
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,030
He keeps going like that,
we could make bacon out of Bugsy.

649
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,970
He's kidding, Bugsy.
Take it easy.

650
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,230
-[both laugh]
-OK. Let's get you carnivores to bed.

651
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,300
I got a, a new story
I want to lay on you.

652
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,240
What do you think
of cowboys and lndians?

653
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,040
Oh, yes, tonight's the night!

654
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,810
I just like cowboys and lndians
'cause of the conflict.

655
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,350
OK, once upon a time in the Old West,
OK, once upon a time in the Old West,

656
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,910
before room service was
even invented...

657
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,450
,,,there was a farm hand
named Jeremiah Skeets,

658
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,580
He was looking to get
ahead in the world,

659
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,920
but was having a problem

660
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,090
with his current mode
of transportation,

661
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,870
[Jeremiah] Uh, that was my horse.
That wasn't me, everybody.

662
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,540
Someone once told Jeremiah

663
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,800
that if he wanted to be the best,

664
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,370
he'd have to ride the best,

665
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,470
You mind showing me your finest horse?

666
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,850
My ancestors believe horse spirit

667
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,190
come down from mountain
during time of fire, wind.

668
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,890
Many brave warrior
walk trail of moon bear...

669
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,800
OK. Look, I just want to see your finest
horse, not a whole thing there.

670
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,240
-Sorry. I can do it.
-All right.

671
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,170
Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari.

672
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,710
Ferrari.

673
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,380
Oh, my.

674
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,180
Oh, my, oh, my!

675
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,510
Look at that.

676
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,680
-[whinnies like a racing engine]
-Whoa!

677
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,450
I would get automatic respect
riding such a beautiful animal,

678
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,620
but I'm afraid that's just
a bit out of my price range.

679
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,820
-Tell you what, white bread.
-[teeth click]

680
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,560
I'll give you Ferrari...

681
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,170
...for free!

682
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,870
Boo-yah!
The end. I love it.

683
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,710
Brilliant story.
So he got the Ferrari for free.

684
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,340
I love that. I love that.

685
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,750
A guy getting a free horse?
That's not a good story.

686
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,850
Where's the arc? There's no arc.
I've not learned anything.

687
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,320
Also, you've got
a moral obligation to them.

688
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,420
What are they gonna
walk away from that with?

689
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,620
I didn't know we were doing
an After School Special.

690
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,260
Why can't he do something
a real gentleman would do,

691
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,200
like save a damsel in distress?

692
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,900
Not a bad idea, munchkin.

693
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,600
OK. So, uh...
let's continue.

694
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,240
[Bobbi] Jeremiah was
out for a ride when,,,

695
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,510
[woman] Oh, please, don't!

696
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,380
-[man] Give us that jewelry.
-You want my pearls? Help! Please!

697
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,250
-Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoo!
-[horse whinnies]

698
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,790
Oh, my necklace? Here, take it.

699
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,800
-[indistinct chatter]
-Come on, boy!

700
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,760
Here.

701
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,890
What else you got, sweetie?

702
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,200
Help! Help!

703
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,500
[Jeremiah] Leave the lady alone!

704
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,110
Care for a lift, ma'am?

705
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,950
-Yeah.
-Oh!

706
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,390
-Nice horse.
-Oh, what, this old thing?

707
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,480
Now, any of you gentlemen want to give
the nice lady her stuff back?

708
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,250
-[men grumbling]
-Not a chance, huh?

709
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,820
-Because I beg to differ!
-[men shouting]

710
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,090
-My hero.
-I like that.

711
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,030
[Skeeter] So Jeremiah spirited
Miss Davenport away to safety,

712
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,300
when she says,,,

713
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,740
Shall we go drink champagne
in a nearby hot tub?

714
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,040
-Hot tub?
-Mmm.

715
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,050
Uh, yeah. No.

716
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,710
I was saying that because I wanted to
see if you two were paying attention.

717
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,080
What happened was Jeremiah
dropped Miss Davenport off

718
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,490
in the nearest town, safe and sound,

719
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,290
How ever can I thank you, sir?

720
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,590
Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am.

721
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,630
But I do insist on expressing
my gratitude in some manner.

722
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,860
Fair enough. I'll take...

723
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,200
-...$100 million.
-[cash register dings]

724
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,970
The end. Let's hope it works.

725
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,310
Very well written,
brilliantly constructed.

726
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,610
Jeremiah wouldn't take money
for doing a good deed.

727
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,480
Uh...I know Jeremiah
a lot better than you guys.

728
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,040
And believe me, he'd be all over that.
He loves money.

729
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,420
Mmm!

730
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,960
I don't want that.
Go back, rewrite. Rewrite.

731
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,820
Gentlemen don't get paid.

732
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,330
Will you just...
Who's telling the story here?

733
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,490
It should really end more like this.

734
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,500
Well, I must give you
some token of my appreciation.

735
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,760
Oh, no.

736
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,930
Perhaps...a kiss?

737
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,030
Touchdown.

738
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,840
[Patrick] Then an angry dwarf kicks him,

739
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,380
Ow!

740
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,340
What the heck did you do that for?

741
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,380
Because I'm angry.

742
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,310
-[laughing]
-Go! Let's go!

743
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,580
[woman] All right! Yeah!

744
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,380
I didn't do nothing to you!

745
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,650
-The end.
-[Skeeter] You know what?

746
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,060
Laugh as much as you want.
I'll take a Ferrari

747
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,100
and a kiss any day of the week.

748
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,960
I'd just like to kiss a Ferrari.

749
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,430
-All right. Good night.
-Good night, Uncle Skeeter.

750
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,030
Good night, home slice.

751
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,730
Thanks for the stories.

752
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,710
You came up with
all the good parts, Bobbi.

753
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,610
Good night, y'all.

754
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,370
You too there, Bugsy.

755
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,780
And them braids look fantastic.
They've taken years off you.

756
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,340
You mind sleeping over?
I'm gonna duck out a few hours.

757
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Mmm. By the way, um,

758
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,280
I am, uh, legally obliged to tell you

759
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,350
that I suffer from...
sleep panic disorder.

760
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,960
OK, what's, uh, sleep panic disorder?

761
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,520
Believe me, you don't want to know.

762
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:39,470
What am I thinking? Why would
anyone give me a free Ferrari?

763
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,780
I must be losing my mind.

764
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,180
Much power of the horse
underneath that hood.

765
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,320
Hello.

766
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,360
Are you the guy I'm supposed to see?

767
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,260
I'm here, aren't I?

768
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:09,300
So...am I about to get
a cherry red Ferrari?

769
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,480
I don't see why not.

770
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,230
For...free?

771
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,300
Sounds good to...me!

772
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,230
What do I do now?
Eat a gumball or something?

773
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,630
Yes.

774
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,310
-Fell out of the sky, right?
-Yeah.

775
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,370
Shh!

776
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,440
Oh! Shh.

777
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,880
I won't tell nobody.

778
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,860
Now, close your eyes
and count to three.

779
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,690
-OK.
-Then it's all gonna happen.

780
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,750
-No.
-Yeah.

781
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,860
-One, two...
-Yeah.

782
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,020
...three.

783
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,400
Ferrari!

784
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,530
Hey! My wallet!

785
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,330
Not anymore!

786
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,210
Excuse me.
Hi, boys.

787
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,320
OK, thank you.

788
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,920
Thanks, guys. Sorry.
I'm just trying to find my car.

789
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,560
Good thing my wallet
only had three dollars in it.

790
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,160
And my Derek Jeter baseball card!

791
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,600
-[all shouting]
-Guys, guys, stop, please.

792
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,100
[Violet] You've had enough, now.
Thank you.

793
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,270
Stop!

794
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,840
-[all shouting]
-Come on, man!

795
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,650
-Care for a lift, ma'am?
-Skeeter?

796
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,750
-Skeeter Bronson?
-Yes, ma'am.

797
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,720
What do you say you boys

798
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,280
give the pretty lady back
the pictures you took?

799
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,060
Sure about that, now?
Because I beg to differ.

800
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,960
Guy's got a gun!

801
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,160
I'm just happy they
didn't make me use this thing.

802
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,470
-My hero.
-Really?

803
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,910
[Violet] That was brilliant, Skeeter.

804
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,950
[stammers] I don't know what happened.
Something came over me.

805
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,490
It felt good.
It felt really good.

806
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,460
How am I ever going to thank you?

807
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,290
Hmm.

808
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,920
No thanks is necessary, ma'am?

809
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,730
Oh, am I in the presence
of a gentleman?

810
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,990
At your service, ma'am.

811
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:48,560
Well, I must show
my appreciation in some form.

812
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,180
-[grunts]
-Ow!

813
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,910
Consider yourself
big people-bashed, sucker.

814
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,470
I knew you were gonna show up.

815
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,750
Get in the Gremlin, Jimmy,
before Sasquatch calls the cops.

816
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,450
Yeah, 'cause that's
how we do what we do. Right?

817
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,820
That's what you get, buddy.

818
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,620
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Let's go! Yeah!

819
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,990
Pull me in. Let's get
out of here. Pull me in!

820
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,720
-[all chattering]
-Big people stink!

821
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,630
OK, well, you don't see that every day.

822
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:24,470
lndeed. And on that strange note,
I bid you good night.

823
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,200
-Yes, yes.
-[car alarm chirps]

824
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,080
Oh! Oh!

825
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,010
All right, so that's how I'm getting it.

826
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,140
-Getting what?
-This is just...I shouldn't.

827
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,850
l, I couldn't. You know what?
I can. I'm gonna take it.

828
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,820
What are you talking about?

829
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,330
I'm talking about a very generous girl

830
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,190
who wants to give her rescuer
a cherry red Ferrari...

831
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,290
...for free!

832
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,790
This is sick!

833
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:56,640
Well, uh, good luck with that.
I'm just going to go.

834
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,800
What do you mean?

835
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,840
Do you have another one at your house?

836
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,410
Am l, am I supposed
to follow you or something?

837
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,510
So seriously, no, no Ferrari?

838
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,520
Where's the $100 million, at least?!

839
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,580
Boo!

840
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,690
[TV] Hey, hey, hey!
Get your own campaign vehicle,

841
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,520
-[knocking]
-Yeah.

842
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,330
-Hi.
-[both] Hey, Aunt Jill.

843
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,420
Hey, guys.
How did last night go?

844
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,900
An angry dwarf kicked me in the leg,
and I didn't get a free Ferrari.

845
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,030
So there you go.

846
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:31,270
Oh. How sad.

847
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,670
-He's talking about our bedtime story.
-Oh.

848
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,980
Uncle Skeeter said Jeremiah would get
a new horse and a kiss,

849
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,950
but I said the dwarf would kick him.

850
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,710
You said it.

851
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,760
Maybe that's how it works.

852
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,410
The kids control the stories.

853
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,960
And there are the wind chimes.
You know what that means.

854
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,190
What what means?

855
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,460
Huh?

856
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,690
Nothing.
Don't worry about it.

857
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:58,830
I won't.

858
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:04,030
OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing?

859
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,880
Working off the hamburgers
he ate last night.

860
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,750
Yes, I gave Bugsy some hamburgers,

861
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,380
but I gave the children
that wheat germ stuff

862
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,120
because that's what they love.

863
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,490
I guess it's, uh, Bugsy
watching the TV then too?

864
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,150
Yeah, I flipped that on
and, look, he's glued to it.

865
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,560
I'm innocent!

866
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,430
What was that?

867
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,730
Uh...that was the sleep
panic disorder, I believe.

868
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,780
Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.

869
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncle a kiss.

870
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,240
I'm a relative, I deserve it.
Right there.

871
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,010
Oh, that felt nice.

872
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,020
How about one more for the road?

873
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,750
-No.
-Come on, baby!

874
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,480
Don't worry, we'll be back tonight.

875
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,990
Yeah, no, I'm not worried.

876
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,460
You're coming back,
we got a big story tonight!

877
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:02,230
About some hotel theme ideas!
Yeah!

878
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,990
-Maybe we won't come back.
-What?

879
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,630
-Skeeter?
-Sir Butt-Kiss. Sir...Kendall.

880
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,440
I understand that you feel a need
to prepare for our little...showdown.

881
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,340
-Yeah.
-That does not excuse you

882
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,170
from maintenance responsibilities.

883
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,180
-Oh, no. Check.
-Lights are out in the spa.

884
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,680
-The south service elevator is slow.
-Check.

885
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,310
Let me try that cheesecake.

886
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,050
Oh, another thing.

887
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,350
I heard about your big hero act
with my girlfriend last night.

888
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,400
-This paparazzi was...
-I know what it is you're trying to do,

889
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,230
and it's not gonna work.

890
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,860
You have to find another way

891
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,700
to cozy up to the old man
because I'm here to tell you

892
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:44,000
Violet Nottingham is not gonna
date a gum-scraping handyman.

893
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:47,870
Hey, Kendall.

894
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,310
Two things. First off,
you got something right there.

895
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,480
Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.

896
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,990
Good. Secondly, when I get
the job at the new hotel,

897
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,220
I was actually considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.

898
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,260
Your brief little trip
to the land of make-believe

899
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,530
is just about over, my friend. OK?

900
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,900
We all know your failed father
ran this hotel into the ground,

901
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,630
and thankfully, you will not
get the chance to make

902
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,510
the same mistake all over again.

903
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,040
May want to pick that up.

904
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,190
-It's Duncan.
-[Aspen] Lover, hello,

905
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,750
I'm looking for the hotel site.

906
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,950
I gave you the address,
macho bunny,

907
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,760
The address you gave me is no good.
There's a school here.

908
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,700
-Oh, what school?
-Webster Elementary School.

909
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,530
-Oh, then you're in the right place,
-Is that so?

910
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,330
-This school is being shut down,
-Uh-huh.

911
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,340
The old man pulled a few strings
at the board of education,

912
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,930
-Really?
-We start demolition immediately,

913
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,140
That is very exciting news.

914
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,440
Oh, Pinky,
[growls, barks]

915
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,950
-[phone rings]
-[Skeeter] Hello!

916
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,960
Skeeter? Hey, it's Wendy.

917
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,220
-Hey, sissy,
-Hey. How's it going?

918
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,920
-Are the kids OK?
-Oh, yeah, We're having a blast,

919
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,460
That was impressive, Bobbi,

920
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,630
but Uncle Skeeter can jump
over the couch the long way,

921
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,030
-Skeeter, can I talk to them?
-No, I'm taking them camping,

922
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,830
-No.
-Have fun in Arizona, Bye!

923
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,840
Camping? No, Skeeter,
they could get poison ivy!

924
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:29,740
-[Skeeter] Let's go. Quietly.
-[Patrick] Where are we going?

925
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,780
-Someplace special, fools.
-[Bugsy] Whoo-hoo!

926
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:35,580
Now march, march,
march, march...

927
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,450
# I don't know
but it's been said

928
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,110
# Bugsy's eyes
pop out of his head

929
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,420
-March, march, march...
-[kids giggling]

930
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,620
-[Bugsy] Whoo-hoo!
-[Skeeter] March, let's go.

931
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,960
[kids] Whoa! Cool!

932
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,330
We're going to have ourselves
a camp-out.

933
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,460
[Jill] You guys, look what he's done!
lsn't this cool?

934
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,940
-See? See how nice I am?
-Yeah.

935
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,060
Whoa, OK, just be careful
around the fire.

936
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,740
Hey, Jill. Shh.
Don't want everyone to hear we're here.

937
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,140
I heard about marshmallows.
Saw them in magazines.

938
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,150
I never imagined they
would be this good.

939
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,310
Let's just hope your mother
doesn't find out I gave you any.

940
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,050
-I won't tell her.
-I'm not talking about you.

941
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,390
She's the weak link.

942
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,890
I think I can let this one slide.

943
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,020
Ahh! The mermaid's being cool.
Look at that.

944
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,960
-The what?
-The nothing.

945
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,900
You know, when we were younger
and your mom and I were out on the roof,

946
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,310
my dad would always tell us
to look at the stars

947
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,540
and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...

948
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,170
Right over there.
Right over there. Look, look.

949
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,880
To me, that looks like a camel.

950
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,040
You see the humps? Huh?
The tongue hanging out?

951
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,490
Oh, yeah. I see that.

952
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,580
Hey, look over there!
It's a pyramid.

953
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,020
[Skeeter] Yeah!
Hey, good one, Patrick.

954
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,990
Look, right next to the moon.
Right, right beside it.

955
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,090
It looks exactly like Bugsy.

956
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,560
-[Skeeter] Oh, my God!
-[all laughing]

957
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,570
Don't worry, Bugsy.
Your eyes are still bigger.

958
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,600
Uncle Skeeter?

959
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,080
Yes, good-looking.

960
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,610
Do you think my father will come back?

961
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,550
Um...
Well, that's a tough one.

962
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:25,760
He must be going through some...
mental malfunction

963
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:30,600
to not want to be with you two guys
every second of the day.

964
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:35,300
But, uh, I do know this.

965
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:38,000
You're always going to have your mother.

966
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,340
You're always gonna have
this girI to hang out with.

967
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:44,810
And me, I ain't ever going anywhere.

968
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:47,640
OK?

969
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,650
I'm like the stink on your feet.
I'll always be around.

970
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,050
OK. You guys made me late.
I hope you're happy.

971
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,930
Well, thank you.
Have fun at night school.

972
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,100
See you tomorrow.

973
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,540
All right, we got rid of her,
so let's get to business.

974
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,470
Put the s'mores down.
Story time.

975
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:15,410
All right, guys. Tonight's story's
gonna be extra special.

976
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,280
It's called...

977
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:22,250
,,, The Great Hotel ldea Story,

978
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,410
Yeah!

979
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,680
-What?
-Boring.

980
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,660
Come on, guys,
I really need you to do this.

981
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,490
It's gonna help
my life a lot. Please?

982
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,060
All right, you know what?

983
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,430
We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.

984
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,860
How about some Evel Knievel stuff?

985
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:40,330
Racing, jumping, flying...

986
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,800
Or maybe something like romantic?

987
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,330
I have a good idea.

988
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:49,540
Let's combine the action
and the romance

989
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:52,270
and make a romaction story.

990
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,480
-[both] Yeah.
-[Skeeter] Let us begin.

991
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,990
The greatest of all the heroes
in ancient Greece

992
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,520
was, of course, Skeetacus.

993
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,990
He was truly amazing

994
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:09,050
yet totally underrated
and had been ignored for years,

995
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,400
Finally Skeetacus had his chance
to show his skills in the grand arena,

996
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,870
If he could impress the
daughter of the emperor,

997
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,070
he knew he would one day rule the land,

998
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,640
-Skeetacus, Skeetacus!
-Go on, Skeetacus!

999
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,650
That's pretty fancy chariot work.

1000
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,150
For a peasant.

1001
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,990
# I see London, I see France

1002
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,390
# I see my golden underpants

1003
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,700
Oh, wh...what is he doing?

1004
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:52,970
Whoa!

1005
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,210
[Skeeter] Bring on the elephants!

1006
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,090
-Whoa.
-Ooh.

1007
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,010
All right.

1008
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:08,780
[Skeeter] You know how Hercules

1009
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,830
supposedly founded the Olympics?

1010
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,630
Well, Skeetacus invented the X Games,

1011
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,230
He's never gonna make it!

1012
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,980
Now that's first class.

1013
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,610
Hey!

1014
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,550
-Bravo!
-Wow.

1015
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,330
Can you dig it?

1016
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,490
How we doing so far, huh?

1017
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,590
-This is the best story yet.
-Can we get to the romance now?

1018
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,470
[Skeeter] Well, shorty, you tell me?

1019
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,060
Does Skeetacus get
the girI he was after?

1020
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,610
[Bobbi] In these stories,

1021
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,170
the hero always gets the fairest
maiden in the land,

1022
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,740
Yes! You said it!
OK, so it's gonna happen!

1023
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,870
Uh, right. So, what? They're thirsty?
They go off for drinks?

1024
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,420
A little wine and cheese action? Yes?

1025
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:15,480
[Bobbi] Yeah, they can go to an old
tavern, And guess who's there?

1026
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,490
Led Zeppelin.
Say Led Zeppelin, please.

1027
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,460
No. All the girls that were mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1028
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,830
What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1029
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,730
He was like
the coolest guy in school.

1030
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,770
That's not what Mom said.

1031
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,830
All right, everybody was
mean to Skeetacus.

1032
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,670
He had problems.
All right, tell your story.

1033
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,040
Oh, my God...

1034
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,440
[Bobbi] They see he's now with

1035
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,270
the fairest maiden in all the land,

1036
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:40,710
and they are really jealous,

1037
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,940
[Patrick] So jealous they
don't know what to do,

1038
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,850
They just start nervously
doing the hokey-pokey.

1039
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,750
[all] # Put your right hand in

1040
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,620
# You put your right hand out

1041
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,390
# You put your right hand in

1042
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,390
# And you shake it all about

1043
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,320
OK.

1044
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,420
[Bobbi] So then,

1045
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,160
Skeetacus takes his date
out to the beach,

1046
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,430
[Patrick] All of a sudden,
a big hairy guy

1047
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:07,810
washes up onshore, passed out,

1048
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,740
[Skeeter] Why a hairy guy?
I don't get it,

1049
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:10,900
[Patrick] Just 'cause,

1050
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,180
He had something stuck in his throat,
and he wasn't breathing,

1051
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:21,380
-Thanks.
-He's OK.

1052
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,650
And then it starts pouring,
so they run into a magical cave.

1053
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,700
-Caves are nice.
-And Abe Lincoln's there.

1054
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,100
Abe Lincoln?
What, is this a joke to you?

1055
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:33,030
What the heck's the matter with you?
Oh, I'm sorry.

1056
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,300
l, I didn't mean to yell.

1057
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,860
The Abe Lincoln thing, that's,
that's a good idea.

1058
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,900
It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?

1059
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,380
Don't you think he should?
It's...been a long time for him.

1060
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:49,540
His lips are very dry
from not using them.

1061
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,250
-Bugsy, you with me?
-[groans]

1062
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,880
We'll see.

1063
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,520
-[Violet] Hello?
-Mmm.

1064
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,220
Hey, is this the fairest maiden
in the land?

1065
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,320
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?

1066
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,700
Yes, it is, Sorry about that Ferrari
confusion the other night,

1067
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,210
I'm here at the beach right now
and I had a hunch you might be here too.

1068
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,040
What do you say
we get a little lunchsky?

1069
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:13,600
That sounds so delightful,

1070
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,700
But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.

1071
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,140
Vegas?

1072
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,580
Uh, no one talked about Vegas.

1073
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,910
Don't tell Kendall.
He thinks I'm in the library.

1074
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,320
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,

1075
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,580
I, I really thought we
were gonna hang out today.

1076
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,390
Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.

1077
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,450
Bye, Skeeter,

1078
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,390
Hmm.

1079
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,490
So our date's gonna be tomorrow?
I can live with that.

1080
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:41,590
-Hey! Look out! Look out!
-[both shouting]

1081
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:46,040
-[Skeeter groans]
-Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!

1082
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:49,340
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?

1083
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,940
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

1084
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,880
I'm supposed to be
looking for a job now,

1085
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:57,110
but for some reason I felt like
coming to the beach today.

1086
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,950
Um, are you hungry?

1087
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,010
Yes, I'm always hungry
when I'm in pain.

1088
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,190
Good. Because I'm buying.

1089
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,030
I'll let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,

1090
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,290
-so how was I gonna pay?
-Of course you got your wallet stolen.

1091
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,700
-I don't know what that means.
-You. It's always something with you.

1092
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,600
-Huh?
-You're wearing my hat.

1093
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:19,200
-Gonna wear that all day?
-I'm not wearing nobody's hat.

1094
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,970
-I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
-I'll take it back. Thanks.

1095
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,180
This is perfect for your free lunch.

1096
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,310
Oh, my gosh. You guys,
you guys, you guys. Over there.

1097
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,320
Is that...
is that Skeeter Bronson?

1098
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,860
-Stop it.
-Oh, my God.

1099
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,290
-Oh, my God.
-Skeeter.

1100
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,560
Hey! Do you remember me?

1101
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:44,530
It's Donna Hynde from high school.

1102
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,360
Yeah, I do.

1103
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,030
Thought I was going to run into you
shortly. And here you are.

1104
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,340
Yeah. Wow, this is so...
weird. Uh...

1105
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,880
We were just planning
our high school reunion.

1106
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:59,210
We were totally just talking about you.
It's so weird.

1107
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,250
I was just talking about you guys too.

1108
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,810
Sure, he was.

1109
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:05,550
Mind pretending to be
my girlfriend for a second?

1110
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,560
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

1111
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,990
l'll, uh, convert my truck to biodiesel.

1112
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,420
-OK, I'll do it.
-Ding-dong.

1113
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,660
Uh, this is my girlfriend,
guys. This is Jill.

1114
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:18,430
Hello.

1115
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,020
She's your girlfriend?

1116
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,540
Yeah. Yeah.

1117
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,160
Yes, I am.

1118
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,570
-Right?
-Yup.

1119
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,870
She thinks l'm...

1120
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,340
You want me to...
Oh. Uh...romantic.

1121
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,280
She likes how romantic I can be.

1122
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,370
And, uh, "great kisser,"
she likes to say.

1123
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,780
Oh, yeah. That's...
a little too much.

1124
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:41,910
-Oh. Sorry.
-Wow, you are really pretty.

1125
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,290
-I mean, she's all right.
-Thanks.

1126
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,230
I've seen hotter,
but she's pretty cool.

1127
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,630
So super skinny.

1128
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,330
Skinnier than you.
But...Yeah.

1129
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,730
Whatever.

1130
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,430
I feel really awful
saying this out loud.

1131
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:02,270
We were really terrible to Skeeter
in high school. Awful. So mean.

1132
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,780
My Skeeter?

1133
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,250
-They were.
-You had a hard time in high school?

1134
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,980
Look at you now.
You turned out pretty...cute.

1135
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,610
-[girls] Yeah!
-You know...

1136
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:14,820
the pimples went away,
and, uh, these came to play.

1137
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,320
-You want to touch them?
-Oh, that's OK.

1138
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,520
-Later, later.
-They're here for you. Ding-dong.

1139
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,460
# You put your right hand in

1140
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,930
[all] # You put your right hand out

1141
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,600
# You put your right hand in

1142
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:31,540
-# And you shake it all about
-OK.

1143
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,630
-I think we should leave.
-Yes.

1144
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,570
# And you turn yourself around

1145
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,080
-All right. Bye-bye.
-# That's what it's all about #

1146
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,410
What's happening?

1147
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,780
Hey, so I spoke to Wendy.

1148
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,750
She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.

1149
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,840
This is the longest
she's been away from them.

1150
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,520
That's right.
This is my last night with the kids.

1151
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,390
You know,
they're gonna be devastated.

1152
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,120
They worship you

1153
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,960
and those amazing bedtime stories
you've been telling them.

1154
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,800
Oh, well, they say all the good parts.
I promise.

1155
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,960
Oh, my gosh.
Is he unconscious?

1156
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,130
Yeah, yeah.

1157
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:08,040
Boom! Oh.

1158
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,880
Thanks!

1159
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,110
Whoa!

1160
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,050
-Yeah?
-Check out Mr. Smooth.

1161
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,710
-Well, you know, I do what I do.
-[both laughing]

1162
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,350
-Think we should get out of this rain?
-What rain?

1163
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,760
Oh, shoot!
Where did that come from?

1164
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,630
I don't know!
lsn't it amazing?

1165
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,820
-Let's get out of this!
-Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!

1166
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,070
I can read the future.

1167
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,400
Good God. So...

1168
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,740
So...The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?

1169
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,480
I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...

1170
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:48,880
good luck on it anyway.

1171
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:50,320
-Thank you.
-Yep.

1172
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:54,720
Actually, you can come
if you want. It's like a party.

1173
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:57,520
You know, Wendy's gonna be
watching the kids,

1174
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,890
and we could have fun.

1175
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,590
You can meet me there.

1176
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,720
Yeah. That would, uh...

1177
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,460
I could do that.
I could meet you, um...

1178
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:10,160
...after night school or something.

1179
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,170
It's you?

1180
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,400
It's me what?

1181
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,910
You're the fairest maiden in the land?

1182
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:26,150
"Fair" as in
"doesn't cheat at checkers"?

1183
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,660
No, fairest as in...

1184
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,290
..."beautifulest."

1185
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,140
Wait, wait.
Something weird's gonna happen.

1186
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,080
Oh.

1187
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,240
No, yeah, we don't...
This is a mistake.

1188
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:57,250
No, no, no, not between us.
I mean like, some...

1189
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,190
No! No, no!
Oh, here comes Abe!

1190
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,790
No!

1191
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,260
Ah! Look.

1192
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,760
-Wow, a penny.
-No, no, no.

1193
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,930
This is the weird thing
I was talking about. Abe Lincoln.

1194
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,910
-Yeah. Yeah.
-No, no, no, no.

1195
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,910
Abe's not gonna interrupt
this time. That was it.

1196
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,710
It's supposed to end better than this.

1197
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,840
Stick around. I'm tellin' ya,
you're gonna be missing out.

1198
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,620
Nice imagination, Patrick.

1199
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,190
-Skeeter?
-Yo.

1200
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:47,000
We've got a little bit
of a shaving situation in there.

1201
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:49,400
Oh, no, no, no.
I took the razor blades out.

1202
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,300
Don't worry. Their father ain't around,

1203
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,530
I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.

1204
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,610
I'm Princess Leia.

1205
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,370
Uh-huh.

1206
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,710
So, are you ready
for the big showdown tomorrow night?

1207
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:04,770
Oh, yeah.

1208
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,150
What I'm going to do is

1209
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,160
tell them a bedtime story tonight.

1210
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:11,020
I'll have me win in the story.

1211
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:14,620
Then I'll win for reals.
Do you dig?

1212
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,390
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.

1213
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,700
So it's like, um,
positive visualization.

1214
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:20,500
I read a book on that once.

1215
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,770
Read the back cover, at least.

1216
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,170
I can't read.

1217
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:31,940
Shut up, Bugsy!

1218
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:34,640
I've got opposable thumbs.
How do you feel about that?

1219
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,310
[Skeeter] You children ready?

1220
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:41,120
Because here comes our last story.

1221
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,990
The fate of the entire universe

1222
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,890
hung in the balance,

1223
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,230
as the Supreme Galactic Council

1224
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,730
met to determine who would control

1225
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:57,000
the new planet in the vast
Nottinghamian star system,

1226
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:02,710
Most in attendance expected
Supreme Leader Barracto

1227
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,980
to rule in favor of General Kendallo,

1228
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,880
the evil governor of Hotelium,

1229
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:13,150
But there was a wild card in the mix,,,

1230
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,920
,,,Skeeto Bronsonnian

1231
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:20,020
and his sidekick,
Mickey Doo Quicky Doo,

1232
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,560
They all watched with excitement,

1233
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:26,190
Lieutenant Jilli
and her two young cadets,

1234
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:30,300
Aspenoff, and even
the great Captain Bugzoid,

1235
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:34,900
[Patrick] Hey, since it's outer space,
Skeeto should talk like a goofy alien,

1236
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,140
-[Skeeter] What?
-[gibberish]

1237
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,280
That's disgusting.
I'm not going to translate that.

1238
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,580
Silence!

1239
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,050
The leader of the new planet

1240
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,320
shall be determined
the old-fashioned way:

1241
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:52,620
A zero-gravity fight.

1242
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:07,670
[Skeeter] OK, now we get to the part
the crowd came to see,

1243
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,840
Skeeto defeating Kendallo, right?

1244
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:15,410
[Patrick] I think we need
to see them battle first,

1245
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,990
[Patrick] Kendallo makes the first move,

1246
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,980
-[both] Skeeto!
-[Skeeter] But the kids

1247
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,240
really want to see Skeeto
kick his butt, right?

1248
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,150
Wet willy.
[laughs]

1249
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,750
Boring!

1250
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:01,490
Uh, bring out the booger monster!

1251
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,960
[Skeeter] Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick,

1252
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:21,340
[Skeeter] All right, have the booger
monster smack Kendallo around,

1253
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,820
[Bobbi] No, I think he should kiss him,

1254
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:29,020
[Skeeter] Would you get
to Skeeto winning already?

1255
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,030
[Patrick] OK,

1256
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,930
Whoa!

1257
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,840
Arise, Skeeto,
sharif of Nottinghamia.

1258
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,650
-Whoopee!
-Whoo!

1259
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,780
And that is the perfect ending

1260
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,720
to our last story.

1261
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:05,260
Thank you, children.

1262
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,920
Oh, that's not the ending.

1263
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,900
Yeah. That would be too obvious.

1264
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,950
What do you mean?

1265
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,620
Somebody threw a fireball at Skeeto

1266
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,860
and Skeeto got incineratated.

1267
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,400
-The end.
-"lncineratated"?

1268
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,770
-[crowd groans]
-[Skeeter] You mean "incinerated"?

1269
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,970
No! No, no!
He can't catch on fire.

1270
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:27,640
Yeah. I'm Captain Skeeto.
I'm on fire!

1271
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,150
[Skeeter] No, no, no.
The story can't end like that.

1272
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,050
What happened to a nice, happy ending?

1273
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,250
You said happy endings
don't really happen.

1274
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,810
We want our story to be real.

1275
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:39,120
Oh, I was just saying that.
I was stupid.

1276
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,750
-[yawns]
-No, no, no, no, no.

1277
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,320
So, what? We're really going
to have me on fire? Hey!

1278
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,530
Don't fall asleep, or the story
will lock. Stop it! Wake up!

1279
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,000
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

1280
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,540
I can't believe
Skeeter didn't tell you.

1281
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:55,600
And I'm sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hotel

1282
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,550
is going up right here
where the, where the school is.

The bad news is,

-You pushed that man in the pool.

I love you.

You brought me a grilled cheese
sandwich once.

Yeah. I did, yes.

1333

It was Monterey Jack.
It's a good cheese.

will take place in the living room.

to want to miss this.

No, it's swelling up!

-Yes, of course.

-Don't touch me.
-Sorry.

1342
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:18,380
Before we begin, I would just like to say,

1343

Yes, now, as you can see,

1348
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:30,490
I've invited some of the staff to sit in

1349
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,260
to see how your ideas would
play with the "regular folk."

1350
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:37,360
-No offense.
-None taken, Barry. None taken.

1351
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:39,790
[Barry] So, gentlemen,

1352
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,800
which of you would like to go first?

1353
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,430
Fair enough.

1354
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:49,740
Mr. Nottingham,
you were absolutely right

1355
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:53,300
when you said the rock and roll
theme was old hat.

1356
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:58,510
Gone. Your insight, sir,

1357
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:01,650
has inspired me to,
to dig deeper,

1358
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:06,100
to find the commonality at the heart of the American experience.

1359
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,100
I speak, of course...

1360
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,100
...of the musical theater.

1361

01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:04,480
Uh...

1387
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:07,010
I was eating ice cream,
and suddenly a bee...

1388
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:10,540
Uh, it was on an ice cream,
and he licked it.

1389
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:14,650
Hmm. Can you translate
Skeeter's presentation for us?

1390
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,020
-Mmm!
-Uh...Yes!

1391
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:18,560
Yes, I can do that.

1392
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,450
Thank you. Ready?

1393
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:24,590
-[Mickey] I'm ready. OK.
-[Skeeter] Ready?

1394
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:36,140
"I spent the last week in the hotel,
the hotel where I live..."

1395
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,510
With my niece and nephew.

1396
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,910
"With my niece and my nephew."

1397
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:50,350
"To a kid, everything about a
hotel is strange and wonderful."

1398
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:54,490
"Sleeping in a different bed."

1399
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,760
"Hanging out in the lobby."

1400
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:02,200
"Jumping up and down on the alligator."

1401
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:10,070
"Riding up and down in the elevator."

1402
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,200
[all] Ah!

1403
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,080
Sorry. Yeah, I see now
that an alligator

1404
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,770
wouldn't be in that context.

1405
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:25,230
"Some hotels try to make it seem
as much like home as possible."

1406
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,030
"But they're missing
the point."

1407
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:37,430
"If you wanted to stay in a place like home, then why not stay at home?"

1408
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:45,240
"Our guests should experience
an escape from the everyday."

1409
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:54,490
"And that's what I'd like to capture
in our new hotel."

1410
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:03,590
"What every kid knows
and what every adult has forgotten."

1411
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:13,240
"Like my father said to me,

1412
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:17,750
your fun is only limited
by your imagination."

1413
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:23,650
-That was beautiful.
-Yeah? All right. Settle down.

1414
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,150
Just the way it built.

1415
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:29,160
And that's it? I'm sorry.
I don't understand it.

1416
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:34,690
That...was...brilliant!

1417
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,990
Congratulations, my boy.
You've just won the keys to the kingdom.

1418
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:54,580
Boogie, don't do that. Germs.

1419
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:00,020
Congratulations. Great job.
Keep icing that tongue.

1420
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:02,520
-All right.
-Congratulations, Skeeter.

1421
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,520
-Congratulations. That was great.
-Yeah?

1422
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:08,130
That's just terrific.

1423
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:10,630
Congratulations, Skeeter.

1424
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,900
All right, Kendall.
Yeah. No hard feelings, pal.

1425
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:16,960
Of course not. You deserve it.
You're a better man than me.

1426
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,510
-You have an iron will.
-Yeah. That's what they say.

1427
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:23,070
I would not have the guts to tear down
the school my niece and nephew attend.

1428
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:25,110
What?

1429
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:29,240
You do know that's the site
for the new hotel?

1430
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,220
What are you talking about?

1431
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,520
-Good show, old son.
-Oh, sir.

1432
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:37,790
That bee sting language was really
working for you on a sympathetic level.

1433
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:40,490
Good, I'm glad. I wanted to talk to you
about the location

1434
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,990
that we're building the hotel.

1435
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,220
[all] # Happy birthday to you

1436
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,530
# Happy birthday to you

1437
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,590
# Happy birthday

1438
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:15,620
Bronson, you're fired!

1439
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,360
Fired?

1440
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,590
Oh...

1441
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,690
That's how it connects.

1442
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:34,970
Yes?

1443
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,950
Do you know where
Jill Hastings' class is?

1444
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,350
It's right over there.

1445
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,750
Why won't you answer my calls?

1446
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,290
Because I know it's you calling.

1447
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,620
You got to believe me, Jill.
I had no idea...

1448
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:52,160
Don't destroy the sliver of respect
I have for you by making lame excuses.

1449
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,630
Just go away and stay away.

1450
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:03,140
Uncle Skeeter? Do you want
to incinertate our school

1451
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:06,010
'cause we incinertated you in the story?

1452
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,340
No, I wouldn't do that.

1453
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:11,210
We thought you were
supposed to be the good guy.

1454
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,500
So did I.

1455
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:48,620
"Skeeto defeats Kendallo."

1456
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:51,930
-Not really.
-[knocking]

1457
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:56,050
-Yeah?
-Hey.

1458
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:59,030
Oh, hey.
Welcome back.

1459
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,330
So, you mad at me, too?

1460
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,240
Not as mad as Jill,
but, uh, mad, yes.

1461
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:08,940
I didn't know the new hotel
was going up there.

1462
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,840
I figured that.

1463
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:12,000
Then what are you mad at?

1464
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,600
I gave the kids junk food?

1465
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,880
No, I figured you'd do that too.

1466
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:19,080
I'm mad because you told my kids

1467
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:21,490
that in real life
there are no happy endings.

1468
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,490
Well, look around you, Wendy.

1469
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,690
Do you see any happy endings here?

1470
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,400
I don't know. You and Dad always had
so much fun in this room.

1471
01:21:33,470 --> 01:21:35,130
For whatever reason, I didn't.

1472
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,260
I was always the cynic,
the, the sourpuss.

1473
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:41,140
[Skeeter] The black cloud.
The energy drainer.

1474
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:43,340
The...dead fish.

1475
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:46,040
Yes, all of those things.

1476
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,140
But when I left Bobbi
and Patrick with you,

1477
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:51,340
I guess I just was hoping
you'd rub off on them.

1478
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,620
Get them to be lighter.
Have fun. Enjoy themselves.

1479
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:58,220
I thought Dad would like that.

1480
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:02,920
Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona.

1481
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,230
Teaching, not principaling.

1482
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,770
That's cool.

1483
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:09,930
Yeah, well, maybe you can come
visit when we get settled.

1484
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,670
I know by then the kids
will really want to see you.

1485
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,780
All right. Love you.

1486
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,180
Love you.

1487
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:31,820
And so Skeeter sat on his bed,
filled with regret,

1488
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:36,350
wondering how to put the pieces
of his life together after one magical week,

1489
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:40,130
-Great ending, huh?
-That was your ending, son?

1490
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,430
I thought this was just a sad part,
and you were about to make it better,

1491
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,340
What? How could I make it any better?

1492
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:47,900
Well, In the stories I told you,

1493
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,810
just when things looked bleakest,

1494
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,440
the hero would do something
unexpected and courageous

1495
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,310
to beat the bad guy,
save the day, and get the girl!

1496
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:59,410
Yeah. How can I do that?

1497
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:01,080
It's your story, not mine,

1498
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,280
But you better get moving,
Go get 'em, son,

1499
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:16,430
Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham?

1500
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,030
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a moment.

1501
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:22,300
My name is Jill Hastings.
I'm a teacher at Webster Elementary.

1502
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:25,900
[all chanting] Save our school!
Save our school!

1503
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,440
Save our school!
Save our school!

1504
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,210
Save our school!

1505
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:32,980
Save our school!

1506
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,150
My men are in position.
We are ready for the demolition.

1507
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,380
Excellent.
Mr. Nottingham said he'd call

1508
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:40,550
if he had a problem
getting the variance,

1509
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:43,190
so if we don't hear from him
in the next 20 minutes,

1510
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,290
I say we just...blow it all up.

1511
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:54,900
Madam, the war is over.
You lost. I'm sorry.

1512
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,810
This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham.
We're talking about children.

1513
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,910
There must be other possible
sites for your hotel complex

1514
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:07,510
that would not result
in the displacement...

1515
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:09,490
Hey, hey! Barry, Jill.
How you doing?

1516
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,460
We're just wrapping up here.
Donna, you remember Jill, right?

1517
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:16,720
Of course! Oh, my God.
That jacket is so cute!

1518
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,630
Uh, thank you.

1519
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,190
Bronson, what are you doing here?

1520
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:23,700
What am I doing here?
Yeah, what am I doing here?

1521
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:27,610
Oh, uh, well, Mr. Bronson,
as a concerned citizen,

1522
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,400
wanted to bring points to my attention

1523
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,110
before I made any hasty decisions about the property.

1524
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:35,550
And they are points that are going
to take me years to analyze.

1525
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,780
-Years?
-Years.

1526
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:41,380
Bronson, are you
playing hardball with me?

1527
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,820
I am, sir.

1528
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:46,120
Because your application
for variance has been...

1529
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,220
Denied.

1530
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,100
Denied?

1531
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,030
Yes. But the good news is

1532
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,540
Donna and I found you
another piece of property

1533
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,470
right on the beach in Santa Monica
that is uptight and out of sight.

1534
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:03,100
Beachfront was my first choice,
but it's not for sale.

1535
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,640
It is now.

1536
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:06,940
It is! Isn't that fabulous?

1537
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:08,540
Really?

1538
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,110
Oh, oh. [stammers]
Yeah, well, germs.

1539
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,710
Let's get past that.
Come here. Come here.

1540
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:19,160
No, no, no, no, no.

1541
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,060
I'm touching you,
and it's OK. Look at that.

1542
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:24,220
Aw...

1543
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:28,130
Ooh. You're enjoying it.
Good. Bring me closer.

1544
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,900
That is so sweet. And creepy.

1545
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,100
Attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

1546
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:41,550
We are working with highly-sensitive,
dangerous radio-controlled explosives.

1547
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:43,340
[all] Boo!

1548
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:47,350
And so to avoid any tragic misfires,

1549
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,890
I would ask that you all
turn off your cell phones.

1550
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,190
All of you, please.
Turn your cell phones off.

1551
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,850
Did you really just fix everything?

1552
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:58,870
Not everything.

1553
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,600
-Yes?
-We appear to have a situation.

1554
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,640
I can't reach Kendall on his cell phone

1555
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:10,510
to halt the demolition
which will begin in...13 minutes.

1556
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:12,480
[Patrick] This sign we made
is awesome!

1557
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:15,610
[Bobbi] We need a window where
those construction guys can see it.

1558
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,550
Then they'll change their minds.

1559
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,780
Bobbi, I found one.

1560
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:26,890
[Jill] That's my Prius!

1561
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,760
-OK. Where's your truck?
-My truck?

1562
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,890
I had to give it back to the hotel.

1563
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:33,560
What do you mean
you gave it back to the hotel?

1564
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:34,970
Come here!
Come here!

1565
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,370
-[motorcycle revs]
-[Skeeter] Sorry!

1566
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:40,670
It's for a good cause!

1567
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,840
Have you ever driven a motorcycle?

1568
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:47,240
No!

1569
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:20,110
-Oh, my God!
-[horn honks]

1570
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,720
No, no, no, no!
[screams]

1571
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:32,280
Ooh! Yah! Booya!

1572
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,430
Have you seen Bobbi? Patrick?

1573
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,870
Bobbi! Patrick!

1574
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:52,640
What are you going to do?

1575
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:13,330
I'll take that back.

1576
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,160
No fair!

1577
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:20,670
Hey, people, that's 60 seconds!
Whoo-hoo!

1578
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:23,640
Wait! Wait a minute!
I can't find my children!

1579
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:25,840
-They might be in there!
-Nice try.

1580
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,750
We cleared the building hours ago. OK?
Everything is fine.

1581
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:32,850
No! Let me through!

1582
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,910
Hey, we got to check the rooms
before we start making booms.

1583
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:37,790
We've checked it already!

1584
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,090
Do it myself.

1585
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:43,160
-[Jill screams]
-Uncle Skeeter!

1586
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:45,700
[Skeeter] Hey! Get out of there!

1587
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:47,170
-Five... -No!

1588
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:48,760
-Grab the bar!
-Four...

1589
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,970
Three...

1590
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,200
Two...

1591
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,260
One!

1592
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:04,950
The king has issued a proclamation.

1593
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:08,050
The hotel moves away.

1594
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,520
The school will stay.

1595
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,820
Long live Webster Elementary!

1596
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:19,330
-Mom!
-Mom!

1597
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,960
Bobbi! Patrick!

1598
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,430
Oh!

1599
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:29,740
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys underdemeciated me.

1600
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:32,440
Come here! I just got to know you guys.

1601
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:34,980
You think I'm gonna let
you slip away from me now?

1602
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:37,680
[Bobbi] I knew you were the good guy.

1603
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,150
Yeah.

1604
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:43,250
Uh, Patrick, hi.
I'm Trisha Sparks.

1605
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,620
I just wanted you to know that...
thanks for saving the school.

1606
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:50,360
Western. Go Western.

1607
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:55,100
-No thanks necessary, ma'am.
-That's my boy. That's my boy.

1608
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:59,270
There must be some way for me
to show my appreciation.

1609
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:05,040
Oh-ho-ho! Get it.

1610
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:10,170
Ooh! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1611
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,910
Hey, isn't she a little old for you?

1612
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,950
-She's hot.
-So is she. What do you think?

1613
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,820
If Master Stinky's getting a kiss,

1614
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:20,020
shouldn't, shouldn't I get
a little mermaid action?

1615
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:22,150
-Come on, already.
-[Skeeter] Ooh!

1616
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:39,100
Now look what my boy has done,

1617
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:42,010
Turned his back on the world
of luxury hotel management

1618
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,070
to start a small family business,

1619
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:49,320
And bless his heart,
he even named it after me,

1620
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:52,690
Hey, speaking of s'mores,
it looks like Bugsy ate them all.

1621
01:30:54,730 --> 01:30:56,590
We're completely out of marshmallows.

1622
01:30:56,660 --> 01:31:00,030
Oh, all right. Let me handle that.
Room service!

1623
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,160
-Yes, sir?
-[Skeeter] Hi, Kendall.

1624
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,760
Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows.

1625
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,400
If you could just go get him some,
that would be great.

1626
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,070
Right on it, sir.
Anything else?

1627
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,240
Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh...

1628
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:13,970
-[bell dings]
-...Housekeeping?

1629
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:16,940
Hey, Aspen.

1630
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,380
Could you just make sure
that Bugsy's cage is clean

1631
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:21,050
before he checks out in the morning?

1632
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,990
His marshmallows don't agree with him,
there's gonna be a mess.

1633
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,820
[Skeeter] All right.

1634
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:31,660
OK, bye, guys.

1635
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:34,060
I think Bugsy
is trying to tell us

1636
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:36,100
that our tale has reached its end,

1637
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:37,900
But before I go, let me tell you

1638
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:40,370
what our heroes and villains
are doing now,

1639
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,340
My old friend, Barry Nottingham,

1640
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:44,970
overcame his fear of germs
to such a degree

1641
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:47,380
that he decided to leave
the hotel business

1642
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:50,040
and enter the field of medicine,

1643
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:54,420
He is currently the school nurse
at Webster Elementary,

1644
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:56,750
Violet now runs the hotel empire,

1645
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:59,220
along with her husband, Mickey,

1646
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:01,350
the former room service waiter

1647
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:04,260
who is now the ninth-richest
person in the world,

1648
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,330
And Skeeter and Jill?

1649
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,840
After the double wedding of the century,

1650
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:15,530
they lived,,, well, happily ever after,

1651
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:17,370
running Marty's Motel

1652
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,680
and spending a lot of time
with my grandkids,

1653
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:23,510
whose adventures have just begun,

1654
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:27,610
Though, not everyone
is quite so excited,

1655
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:30,490
But that is a whole other story,

1656
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,350
The end,
