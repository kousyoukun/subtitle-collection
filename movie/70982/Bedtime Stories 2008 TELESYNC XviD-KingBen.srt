<i>And Skiter.</i>

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,320
To help you with your luggage
Mr and Mrs Ntixon;

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
Thank you, young man.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
- Want help?
- No, okay.

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,520
<i>For Skiter the motel
was a paradise.</i>

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
The galaxy is our fit
both.

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
<i>A magical place..</i>

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,440
<i>filled with new adventures
for a six year old boy.</i>

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,560
Come here.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
<i>loved the party as too.</i>

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,000
<i>And always looking for ways to
do even better.</i>

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
I have many ideas to
improve things here.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,720
I was thinking to put an extra
pair of socks as a gift..

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,200
Always remember to take socks
when you go travel.

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,920
Good idea. Time to sleep now, I
meeting with Mr. Nottingham.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,520
Wait, Dad!
I am tired.

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,000
- How about a story?
- Yes.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
Once upon a time,
was a boy.

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,920
In Skiter said.

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>I could say nice stories.</i>

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
<i>The to make my child be
smiling, it was magical.</i>

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,680
<i>I was a good dad
and a good host.</i>

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,600
<i>Unfortunately, bad businessman.</i>

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,880
You see the signs?

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,840
The motel is sinking in red ink
and I offer you salvation.

41
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,680
I do not know..

42
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,080
If you do not sell in
me, it goes!

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,840
I always hoped that this will be
home for my children.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,480
If your child worked hard and
proven smart when grown..

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
will leave to run.

46
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,280
- Promise?
- Yes.

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,640
Sign now.

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,560
There you go.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,440
Trust me, we will convert
the best hotel in L.A.

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,040
It is good and invisible.

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,320
<i>And just in our humble
Vista motel Sani..</i>

52
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,360
<i>was terrible Sani
Vista Nottingham.</i>

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
<i>And previous 25 years..</i>

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,040
<i>maintained by large
now my son, the Bronson Skiter.</i>

55
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,160
<i>The child for all jobs.</i>

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,440
<i>Although the promise of Mr Nottingham
Skiter that will steer the party..</i>

57
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:18,280
<i>probably forgotten..</i>

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,000
<i>The boy always works
hard in the hope..</i>

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
<i>Waiting the opportunity to.</i>

60
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,400
Madam Ntixon. There is a
problem with the room?

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,880
Nothing major.

62
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,840
He took the bottles of the liqueur
mini bar and you want to pay.

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,960
Not even akoumpisa
damn fridge!

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,800
- Not drink alcohol.
- A mess it was.

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
I saw who won.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,560
He had red hair and beard,
wearing a gray suit with buttons..

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,280
and was 30 cm in height.

68
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,200
We are talking about gnome?

69
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
I did not know that your brother
came to town.

70
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,160
Here's what we do..

71
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,240
To put all the bottles
Missing in my account..

72
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,720
and the next time you see
Aspen to tell which is semi-trol..

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,480
The trol eat them
kalikantzarous, right?

74
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
We ate..

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,120
<i>Today lingering magic
hotel..</i>

76
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
<i>and winds of change will focus on
our history in a new direction.</i>

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,600
<i>What expect from a hotel
Founded by someone like me;</i>

78
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,240
- Time is money, Skiter.
- Yes.

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,200
We do not want to happen electrocution
the big boss.

80
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
- Built?
- To see.

81
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,560
Check one two.

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,000
By listening to the back;

83
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,960
I Bari, all Nottingham..

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,680
<i>The Bari had a Nottingham,
Nottingham one..</i>

85
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
<i>The Bari had a Nottingham..</i>

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,400
<i>whiskered white as snow.</i>

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Cheirokrotiste him.

88
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,920
- Glad to see you.
- Germs.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,640
Mr. Nottingham has become a
phobia, or rather a conscious..

90
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,640
Microbial and how
can be dangerous.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
I did well, not
I swim today.

92
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
The Bari Nottingham!

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,600
In love, is brilliant.

94
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,240
As you know, I have 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,000
But it is known that
is my favorite.

96
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,960
Of course, it is a hotel
of the twentieth century.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,160
We need something to
the twenty-first century!

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,280
So we decided to close
and to build a new..

99
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,840
The Sani Vista Mega Nottingham!

100
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,440
It is the largest
West Coast!

101
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,440
I do not understand all this.
One building is simple.

102
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,840
It is the future in the enterprise
hotels.

103
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,480
.. And a secret question
will you.

104
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,440
With pride in your present
new director of the hotel.

105
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,600
The wait was long.

106
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,400
We all know how hard
works, how smart is..

107
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,040
What is the hotel for him.

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,800
Mr Ypoklitheite
Kendall Duncan!

109
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,760
<i>great cause!</i>

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
I am so much to see.

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,680
Do not touch.

112
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,520
Good job, Dad.

113
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,280
You know my daughter, the Violet;

114
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,120
- I have heard.
- Excuse me?

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,880
Not that he has a reputation,
but it is very sexy, I listened.

116
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,560
Not sexy as hot,
I mean warm heart..

117
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,840
And she likes to get out there and
goes well in bars..

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,840
with different types..

119
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,680
This is the old Violet,
know before me.

120
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,280
Now it's up to me to keep
away from all this, right sir?

121
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,280
It courses with tennis
the Federer..

122
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,360
Good for you.

123
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,440
I must say..

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,520
It is difficult to see
hotel to change positions so.

125
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,120
I hope you can come
to work there for us..

126
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,600
There will be many lamps
who want change.

127
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
Someone akoumpise.
We antiseptic;

128
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,800
Yes, come with me.

129
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,960
Whoever finished, to bring the
creation outside.

130
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,040
We start in five minutes, if not
you have finished yet, hurry.

131
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,480
- Thank you, Director.
- Mom, I am the party!

132
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,240
Nobody eats the
herbs cake!

133
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
Just do not have to smell!

134
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
What, died clown?

135
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,960
- What is the bag?
- Chocolate biscuits.

136
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,240
Easy!

137
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,880
Aderfoula..

138
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
We must bring zacharoeidi
every time you come?

139
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,640
You have to invite
for four years!

140
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,120
What are you talking about? No
spent four years!

141
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
You were here for the barbecue
the four July!

142
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,800
- Remember that struck my husband?
- Yes, it was four years ago.

143
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,000
I wanted to pull the
underwear, but it had holes.

144
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,280
I knew that would be ex-husband
you should be so happy.

145
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,800
How do children go?

146
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,800
The Bobby is very quiet.

147
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,520
There to greet you? Let me
pay type with donkey.

148
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,960
- It stinks in here?
- No, the cake.

149
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
What made, gaidourokeik;

150
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,760
I smell manure!

151
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,040
With children remember?

152
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,120
Uncle Skiter!

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Increase as long
I can see you!

154
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,600
Happy birthday, Bobby!

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,320
I am Patrick,
This is Bobby.

156
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,080
My mistake. I brought you something,
Happy birthday, Bobby!

157
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
Set. I took

158
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
- How to go to school?
- Skiter;

159
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,280
On the call in the office
the director.

160
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,080
Good to get the gifts.

161
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,200
Shampoo?

162
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,640
And soap?

163
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,680
Hanger and towel!

164
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,120
- Do not talk about their school.
- Why, what happens?

165
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,920
- The closing.
- No!

166
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,440
- Dismissal.
- You?

167
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,320
But you classical director!

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,480
You are frightening the children are
nervous when you are next..

169
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,520
We heard nice..
What else can you do?

170
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,120
Besides dictator
or the bogeyman!

171
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,640
I have some interviews in Arizona.

172
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,520
I wanted to talk to you about it.

173
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,520
I notice the children,
for one week.

174
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,440
No! I do not even like!

175
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,880
It will not be difficult. My friend
Jill is a teacher at school.

176
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,240
Will the school and the
attention until the moment of eating.

177
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,165
You just have to do
the night shift!

178
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
- Why can not your friend?
- It is night school!

179
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,720
The man dumped me.

180
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,160
With redundant. We have to move!

181
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,800
I need your help!

182
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,040
You need therefore..
Good, I will.

183
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,920
But we have to say,"This is Skiter
the best, I am spasiklaki".

184
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,560
The Skiter is the best,
I am spasiklaki.

185
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,320
Children will make out
this week.

186
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,680
- Can we go fishing.
- Better not.

187
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,400
Patrick does not know a good swimmer.

188
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,200
We will stay within it.
What say you know a little poker?

189
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,680
Gambling? No.

190
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,240
Then walks in the park and
classification of plant species;

191
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Now do something.

192
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,400
I do not know plants, except
that making such cakes!

193
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,760
Did you like that?
Glue it.

194
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,960
I will strike, I wanted to
do it with their fists..

195
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,800
I do not know?

196
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,960
It is.

197
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
Is this your truck, chief?

198
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,960
Yes, madam.

199
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,440
You know that you copy space
two parking places?

200
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,080
It is a large truck.

201
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,800
Not so, fit into one position.

202
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,800
I had to park on the other side!

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,800
Next time park in
box has much space there.

204
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,760
It is not mine, is the
hotel work.

205
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
If gratzouniso, will
keep from my salary.

206
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,160
The two parking my
provide a cushion"to protect. "

207
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,360
Hotel? You
Ouenti brother!

208
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,280
- Yes.
- I am Jill.

209
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,000
What are you?

210
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
The friend, who helps with the children,
I watch the morning..

211
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,080
You will be always so hostile, Juni;

212
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
Jill name..

213
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,080
And you will always have
this haircut?

214
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,480
You hear? The Goufas
is the most beautiful.

215
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,680
It sounds good for the environment..

216
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
We can all have Prious.

217
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,720
How do you know that I Prious;

218
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,440
Have a Prious breeze.

219
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,280
Are you in my pillow protection,
I want to make back to you..

220
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,080
It would help.

221
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,240
We need glykakia
incidentally..

222
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,480
Give back!
You owe me six dollars!

223
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,200
Why not claim to be the
Director of the new hotel?

224
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,120
- The promise to dad.
- But I was not an appropriate time.

225
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,200
Look how goes. This gave Kendall
because it goes with his daughter.

226
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,960
So goes the business
world, remains in the family.

227
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,520
He takes the girl,
work, everything.

228
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,520
I have nothing.

229
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,840
<i>Are you still there;</i>

230
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,680
Where and how?

231
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,360
<i>have to go to class.
The children are waiting.</i>

232
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Sorry, I forgot.

233
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
I will be there in twenty minutes.

234
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,480
I have the baby sitingk
my nephews tonight, fine..

235
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,840
Any advice?

236
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,800
I was in my cousins, right?
The leave to chtenizoun..

237
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,960
With beautiful and sexy made,
Mile as vanilla style.

238
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,920
- Try it.
- Good idea.

239
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,640
- Can I get some?
- Of course, you're my best friend.

240
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,360
I like ketchup in person
basically rejuvenates the skin!

241
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,920
Who is the victim? You!

242
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,440
Pentanostimo!

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,520
<i>Save our school, please.</i>

244
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,640
- Do you think that will help?
- And miracles happen.

245
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,160
Dad would come back?

246
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,280
Sorry late.

247
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,200
The pajamas are in beds,
will go on to get ochtomisi.

248
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,720
Here is my mobile,
to take if it is urgent.

249
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,400
Good to spend in
night school.

250
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,120
Hey, guys!

251
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,800
Ready, I take a toothbrush
and toothpaste.

252
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,600
And clean underwear.

253
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
Not so alone..

254
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,400
- Want to see TV?
- No!

255
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,240
- Hello?
- Urgent!

256
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
No TV.

257
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,640
The Ouenti wants to see,
do not know?

258
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,760
Many do not know, do not come.
With the old antipathouse them.

259
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,000
You need, you can play
a game, a puzzle..

260
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,880
Something you will find.

261
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,200
Shall I let you wash
hair? You liked them?

262
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,480
Nobody should be
touches the hair.

263
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,840
What say we go next and..

264
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,760
To put the toilet paper
trees of a neighbor;

265
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,320
No? Well,
Time to sleep!

266
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,160
Are you okay?

267
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,000
We need to read our story.

268
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,920
We have none;

269
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,560
What you have here?

270
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,320
The alligator"of uranium
arc saves members";

271
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,200
"The squirrel gets organic
a bicycle helmet";

272
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,160
Do not you read the communist!
You do not have true stories?

273
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,440
Like what?

274
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,440
With kaoumpois, dragons or aliens..

275
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,640
What the hell is in my head?

276
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,400
The Bagksi. In our guinea pig.

277
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,120
- Why you say so?
- For the eyes.

278
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,040
I see..

279
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,520
It would be great even in cow!

280
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,440
It's like bowling balls.
I can not to watch!

281
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,920
Get in on not to watch.

282
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,520
Want to set up a
history, kids?

283
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
As did my father,
perhaps I am good at it.

284
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,280
OK..

285
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,320
Once upon a time, a
magical, distant kingdom..

286
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,000
<i>He lived a brave
and noble knight.</i>

287
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,520
<i>beautiful and lived
a castle,</i>

288
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,800
<i>that visitors from far away..</i>

289
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,600
<i>came to visit.</i>

290
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,200
<i>He worked hard for years.</i>

291
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,480
<i>Do you think that would be
lord of the castle, right;</i>

292
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,600
<i>- Right.
- Wrong!</i>

293
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,640
<i>Basically, it was not even a knight.</i>

294
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,880
No...

295
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,360
<i>It was just a peasant.</i>

296
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,240
<i>Although was the son of the great Marty..</i>

297
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,240
<i>and knew everything about how
to run a castle..</i>

298
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,080
<i>all the thought given.</i>

299
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,440
<i>In said, the main non-assessed.</i>

300
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,440
- What is the Non-ekrimimenta;
- What?

301
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,360
- Non-ekrimimenta.
- I forgot that you are six years..

302
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,880
The main handyman said.

303
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,920
<i>who lived in the kingdom does not care
and much dedication and hard work.</i>

304
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,840
<i>Why was the star Sir Batkiz.</i>

305
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>And pernage days of
glyfontas everyone.</i>

306
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,680
My lord, and of course can
go to the lion king.

307
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,240
The handyman had a friend,
Fred.

308
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,320
<i>Not ippefe.</i>

309
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,720
There were children in the kingdom?

310
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,520
<i>course.</i>

311
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,680
<i>There were two children.</i>

312
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,000
<i>and Mrs vromeri
Mr fetid.</i>

313
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,200
And do not forget. The Tzilian,
queen of the fairies!

314
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,280
<i>If we put it too,
it is a crow thymomeno.</i>

315
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,200
<i>- Be a teacher-mermaid!
- Yes, the best in the world.</i>

316
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,240
Open your books
on page sixteen.

317
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,800
- Yes, Madam mermaid.
- Let us begin.

318
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,920
Okay, let mermaid.
Back in our history.

319
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,440
<i>One day the king invited
their subordinates in the castle.</i>

320
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,120
I have good news. Why now
picked a champion..

321
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,520
Where to diefthinei the castle and
is my adviser and friend..

322
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Sir Batkiz!

323
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
Thanks!

324
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,640
Poor handyman..
In paragkonisan.

325
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,680
<i>Thus moved to a
giant shoe..</i>

326
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,320
<i>He a bad person..</i>

327
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,400
<i>He fell into a swamp..</i>

328
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,680
<i>And the ate crocodiles.</i>

329
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,320
End.

330
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,080
Finally?

331
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,560
- No way!
- Why not?

332
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,480
- It is not happy.
- We are in real life!

333
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,480
The earlier find out,
the better.

334
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,760
- It is not fair!
- What?

335
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,000
You should have an even
chance to become champion?

336
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,960
An opportunity?

337
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,200
If it was better than the Batkiz,

338
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,480
should have a
opportunity to his show.

339
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,600
Well, Bobby.

340
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,600
It said the King..

341
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,560
Now that think..
There is another worthy man.

342
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,160
And it would not be fair to
he has a chance.

343
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,880
Sir handyman!

344
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,480
<i>The crowd then zitokrafgase.</i>

345
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,440
But a peasant vromiaris!

346
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,920
<i>And Fred kicked
a goblin.</i>

347
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,160
The mermaid-teacher did this
bizarre opening to the tail.

348
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,520
And vromeri with dysosmo chorepsan
Irish dancing at the earliest.

349
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,480
And made some bagksi
beautiful dance.

350
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,880
And then..

351
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,280
He began to throw chewing gum!

352
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
Chewing gum?

353
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,640
Why not? Tale is
anything can happen!

354
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,720
Yes, history is. I wish
was so in reality.

355
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
Seriously.

356
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,360
What was that?

357
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
The Bogksi.

358
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,600
Ringing the bell when hungry?

359
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,600
No, when you want to go to sleep.

360
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,600
Like you, Excellency.

361
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
Good sleeping children.

362
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,360
And you, with strange eyes.

363
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,960
I have a lot to work but..

364
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,760
We make a
pentanostimo breakfast.

365
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,480
Where will enjoy.

366
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,120
Some banana and how
say it.. Wheat grains.

367
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,320
They told me that they do not
good, but set.

368
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,960
I like it. Sandwiches
banana-wheat.

369
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,640
Awful.

370
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,240
What have we here?
Not taste..

371
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,080
A little taste.

372
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,400
Now you do not need to
vourtsisoume our teeth.

373
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,280
Want some?

374
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,840
<i>Bronson;</i>

375
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,280
Television Mr Nottingham
spoiled and have to make.

376
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,320
Careful t'anipsia me.

377
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
Sorry, difficult
to hear?

378
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,400
The owner wants Nottingham
to see TV now!

379
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,000
Trolis I say, do not worry.

380
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,120
<i>There is a goblin behind you.</i>

381
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
In brought.

382
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,120
Nice, huh?

383
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,840
We need to make television
but you watch.

384
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,960
Wait.

385
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,360
Remember me? The child for all
the business of the day?

386
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,920
I have my nephews here, but we must
make the TV dad.

387
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,040
You can do a little notice?

388
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,840
OK, go!

389
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,400
Skip!

390
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,760
Mr Nottingham;

391
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,880
It opens the TV!

392
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,680
I will just look.

393
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,120
- Will light up the light.
- No!

394
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,360
Of course not!

395
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,000
Katapolemao a cold, we
to live in dark, you know?

396
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,240
The microbes played 80 times
faster in bright light.

397
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,560
OK again dark.
The berdepsame.

398
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,160
Come with me.

399
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,800
Some will be here..

400
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,600
- Please!
- Excuse me sir, do not see anything..

401
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,880
- There!
- Do television.

402
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,320
- How goes the new hotel, sir?
- Very good.

403
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,080
Still struggling with urban
and building permits..

404
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,480
I can tell you matter.
I want to steal one.

405
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,320
Okay, I tell you.
Sit down.

406
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,080
Good.

407
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,320
Ready?

408
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,800
Rock 'n roll.

409
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,200
Music in the anteroom.

410
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
As the charnt rock?

411
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,000
- Which?
- The hotel Charnt Rock.

412
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,760
The use for years.

413
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
Get me here Kendall
immediately, please.

414
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What a nice little!

415
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,960
Thanks.

416
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
So Patrick, or true courage;

417
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,240
Really.

418
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,400
How old were you the first
Whenever filises girl?

419
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,040
- There has never kiss.
- It's disgusting.

420
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,640
Besides Patricia Sparks.

421
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,800
It is a girl in
your class, son, Roman;

422
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,680
See the note left?

423
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,520
Yes, and now you must
go to school. Come on.

424
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
You h..

425
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,560
Here is your chontropontikos.

426
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,840
Is guinea pig but..

427
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,120
And you young man..

428
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,520
I want to know everything about
Sparks when again.

429
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,360
It is two years older than you.

430
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,880
It is sexy.

431
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,120
I am disappointed too. Almost
to make a terrible mistake.

432
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,200
This idea for your rock 'n roll
is outdated.

433
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,040
I had every intention of
put our own touch.

434
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,640
I begin to remember something
I said to your father, Skiter.

435
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,320
We give you a chance.

436
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,680
If you think a better question,
You will be the director.

437
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,800
We find it very
hard to play as a joke..

438
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,840
- With the type of maintenance?
- No.

439
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,600
The main work here Bronson
and 25 years in the company.

440
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,080
I think that the serious
I underestimated.

441
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,720
- Underestimated?
- Exactly.

442
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,800
We will present your ideas to the party
me this weekend.

443
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,480
Thank you, Kendall.

444
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,520
Mr Bronson, the
TV please.

445
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,480
Note the spray germs!

446
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,560
The best day of my life!

447
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,760
Nice car.

448
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,600
Thanks. You know what they say.

449
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,360
If you want to be the best,
must drive the better.

450
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,080
I do not want to get rude,
but what?

451
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,920
Surprisingly you can get.

452
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,840
If all payments reservations
by the end of your life..

453
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,040
and then multiply by 10,
will buy the exhaust me.

454
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,000
Want plywood, huh?

455
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,680
You win!

456
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,440
It is scary.

457
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,640
Are you kidding! We miss
all my sweet!

458
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
How not seen a
karotsa 5 meters;

459
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,000
Must compete
So Skiter Bronson;

460
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,400
I know..

461
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,640
Thanks for your support.

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,040
I support as needed.

463
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,440
- Hey you guys.
- We search the Skiter Bronson.

464
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,440
It is in Room 109.

465
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,880
From here.

466
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,480
- God, the saw;
- Koitousan in my soul!

467
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Hi, Uncle!

468
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
To the Bagksi..

469
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,320
Why should I stay here?

470
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,400
Why do I watch tonight, Jennifer.

471
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,360
Jill basically..
Scooter.

472
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,040
Ok.

473
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,000
- We did it..
- I did. Look, do it again.

474
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,280
I did nothing strange today?

475
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,200
We substitute teacher
at school.

476
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,280
This is a little weird, too
I say something very strange.

477
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,320
Perhaps coincidentally strange..

478
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,400
As.. Strange chewing gum?

479
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,440
- We do not allow chewing gum.
- Of course not.

480
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,760
- Want to go to sleep?
- It is only five.

481
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,800
And we have not eaten.

482
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,360
Ok.

483
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,120
Room service!

484
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
There you have ever scooter?

485
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,400
Neither have played video games;

486
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,960
- Mom says you chalane minds.
- C'est faux.

487
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,080
I was playing all my life
and look at me!

488
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,320
Perhaps he is right.

489
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,200
Have never eat bacon?

490
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,760
What is this?

491
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,840
It is a juicy fat
pig in the back.

492
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,720
But delicious and not
as heard.

493
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,360
And this is the first hamburger
which fagate ever?

494
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,360
What is the verdict?

495
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,520
- Nice.
- Mom will kill us.

496
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,400
No. First, they
will ever know.

497
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,480
And second, when they ate a lot
grow here in the same room.

498
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
Really?

499
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,920
The Bagksi ate too
the last minutes.

500
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,800
If it continues, would make
bacon him.

501
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,920
Kidding, relax.

502
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,680
Let us go to our beds,
I have a new story.

503
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,960
How about kaoumpois and Indians;

504
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,880
Tonight is the night!

505
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,960
I like them for the conflict.

506
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,440
Once upon a time
the Wild West..

507
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,160
<i>Before discovered service
room, a farmer living..</i>

508
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,480
<i>The Jeremiah Skete.</i>

509
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,440
<i>trying to be grown but
had no problem with the transport.</i>

510
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,480
This was my horse!

511
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,840
<i>Somebody said that if
wanted to be the best..</i>

512
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,320
<i>should lead to the better.</i>

513
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,680
I will show you the best horse?

514
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,160
The thought that my ancestors
the spirit of the horse..

515
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,680
comes from the mountain weather
fire and wind..

516
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,280
Many brave warriors walked
in the wake of the moon..

517
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,280
I just want to see
your best horse.

518
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,240
Sorry.
Can I show you.

519
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,320
Hoopoe, get out, the Ferrari!

520
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,520
Look here..

521
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,760
I 'dina everything to kavaliso,
but not for my pocket.

522
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,640
Let me tell you what will happen,
White Bread.

523
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,200
We give in..

524
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,040
Free!

525
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,400
End. I like you!

526
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,800
Terrible story. Free Ferrari.

527
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,680
And I liked it.

528
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,720
A formula takes
free a horse?

529
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,520
It is not good.

530
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,000
Where is the ark?
There is no box!

531
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,080
You have a moral obligation to
them. What would we?

532
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,000
We knew that we would do
special school..

533
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,360
Why not do something good?
As to save a girl?

534
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,960
Good idea.

535
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,520
Let us continue.

536
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,800
<i>The Jeremiah sergianize when..</i>

537
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,240
Want to my bag?
Help!

538
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,360
In my necklace?
Take it!

539
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,760
What else you got?

540
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,400
Help!

541
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,080
Leave Miss quiet!

542
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,120
Do you get, missy?

543
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,480
- Nice horse.
- This geriko;

544
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,640
It will return the property;

545
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,440
Iroa me!

546
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,760
<i>So Jeremiah led
security, when he said that:</i>

547
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,960
Go to drink champagne in
tub nearby?

548
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,280
Bath;

549
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,120
Yes. No...

550
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,400
I said to see if
with careful.

551
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,480
<i>What happened is that the left
in the next town and unharmed and safe.</i>

552
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,400
How to thank you?

553
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,280
It is not necessary.

554
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,600
I insist you say
gratitude somewhat.

555
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,040
OK, I get..

556
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,000
One hundred million dollars!

557
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,880
End. Let us hope
that will work.

558
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,600
Well, kalodomimeno.
I liked very much.

559
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,720
We will not take money
a good deed.

560
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,360
I know better than you,
believe me, loves the money.

561
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,240
Rewrite it.

562
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,680
The principal is not paid.

563
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,880
Who says the story?

564
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,920
It should go like this:

565
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,120
But you have to show some
my gratitude.

566
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,280
Perhaps a kiss?

567
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,320
Goal!

568
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,440
<i>And then an angry
dwarf the klotsaei.</i>

569
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,240
Why did you do that?

570
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,400
Why am I angry!

571
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,000
End.

572
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,840
Laugh as you want. I'll
Ferrari and kiss in the week.

573
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,400
I want to kiss you a Ferrari.

574
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,520
Good night!

575
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,240
Good night, Uncle!

576
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,320
Thank you for
fairy tales.

577
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,680
You thinking all the good
points, Bobby.

578
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,240
Good night!

579
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,360
And to you, Bagksi.

580
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Fantastic kotsidakia, you will
took years to make.

581
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,960
We will sleep here tonight?
We go for a few hours.

582
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,840
I am legally obliged to tell you
that suffer from panic Sleep Syndrome.

583
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,240
What is this?

584
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,120
You want to know.

585
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,800
Why would someone want to
give me a free Ferrari?

586
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,840
We have to go crazy.

587
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,200
Great power under the
this somewhat.

588
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,800
Hi.

589
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,240
Are you one who is supposed
that we meet?

590
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,640
Here I am;

591
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,480
We get a red Ferrari, then?

592
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,120
Why not?

593
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,960
Free;

594
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,040
It sounds to me.

595
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,360
What now? Want
chewing gum or something?

596
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,400
Yes.

597
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,960
From the sky come, eh?

598
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,520
I would say to anyone.

599
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,720
Close your eyes and
count to three.

600
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,800
And everything will happen.

601
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,040
Ferrari!

602
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,480
In my wallet!

603
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,200
Not anymore!

604
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,320
Thanks guys.

605
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,240
Again that was good
within only 3 dollars.

606
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,720
And the baseball card!

607
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,480
Stop children!

608
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,840
- Want a ride, Miss?
- Skiter;

609
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,840
What you say to return
the photos taken?

610
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,600
<i>No way!</i>

611
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,560
You sure? It is important..

612
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,680
<i>has a gun!</i>

613
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,680
I am not happy
use it.

614
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,160
Iroa me!

615
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,880
Really?

616
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,000
It was wonderful, Skiter!

617
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,600
I do not know what happened, something conquest.
I felt good though.

618
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,200
How to thank?

619
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,000
It is not necessary.

620
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,200
I have my next one major then.

621
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,480
At your service, Miss.

622
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,680
We must show the
gratitude somewhat.

623
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,960
Think and close
people!

624
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,680
I knew that it would appear!

625
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,360
Come on, Jimmy. Before shout
the cops the Saskouats.

626
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,000
Why do so this
we do, right?

627
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,440
Go!

628
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,720
Okay!

629
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,760
The psiloi sucks!

630
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,560
I do not see this every day.

631
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,720
Indeed..

632
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,880
And after this strange
incident in kalinychto.

633
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,680
Ok.

634
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,560
So it will take.

635
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,800
What?

636
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,160
Should..
I could..

637
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,360
- I will get.
- What do you think?

638
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,800
I say a generous girl
wants to give the rescuer..

639
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,760
kerasi a Ferrari!

640
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,840
Free!

641
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,360
Sick!

642
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,040
Just leave.

643
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,360
You have another at home?
Should be to follow?

644
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,560
Ferrari has not been finished;

645
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,640
One hundred million
U.S. dollars at least?

646
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
Yes.

647
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,480
Hi.

648
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,440
- Hey, Aunt Jill!
- How did yesterday, guys?

649
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,920
One angry dwarf with kicked
to stand and not got a Ferrari.

650
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,240
What a shame..

651
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,320
He says the story for us!

652
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,240
The uncle said that Jeremiah will
kiss and take new horse..

653
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,760
but I will say that
klotsage a dwarf.

654
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,600
You said.

655
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,200
Maybe it works. Children
control stories.

656
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,400
Bells. You know
what that means.

657
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
What does it mean?

658
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,160
Nothing.

659
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
- Not at all.
- No.

660
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,840
What do Bagksi;

661
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,760
For hamburgers
who ate yesterday.

662
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,240
I gave the hamburgers and Bagksi
children in this thing with wheat,

663
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,120
because they like it.

664
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,960
The Bagksi saw and
TV then, huh?

665
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,720
In the spring and stuck.

666
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,560
I am innocent!

667
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,920
Who is he?

668
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,880
That was probably the
Sleep Syndrome panic.

669
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,360
Let us go before
next attack.

670
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,120
Give a little kiss on the sulfur.
I am a relative, deserve.

671
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,040
It was.

672
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,640
Another one for the road?

673
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,200
We go at night,
Uncle not worry.

674
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,440
We go because we have a
big story tonight!

675
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,520
For some ideas for
Hotel matters!

676
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,560
Maybe not to go.

677
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,360
Sir Batkiz..
Kendall.

678
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,800
I understand that we must
prepare for our little..

679
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,640
showdown.

680
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,880
But this is not a justification for
Your maintenance obligations.

681
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,600
The lights in the spa fails, the elevator
staff go slowly..

682
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,680
To try the Cheesecake.

683
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,320
Something else.

684
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,320
I heard you on the heroic act
with my girl last night.

685
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,320
I know that trying to do
and will not succeed.

686
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,440
We must find another way to
kalopiaseis the old and you say..

687
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,760
Violet the Nottingham will go on
an employee for any business.

688
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,000
Kendall!

689
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,640
Two things.
First..

690
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
You got something there.

691
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,640
Use your hands,
it is disturbing.

692
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,720
Secondly, when I take the job
the new hotel..

693
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,560
I thought to keep,
so be careful how I talk.

694
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,600
The short trip to your country
faith has just finished..

695
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,960
We all know that the failed
father bankrupt hotel,

696
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,760
and hopefully you will not have the
opportunity to make the same mistake.

697
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,880
Better to collect.

698
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,560
- Duncan.
- Hello, lover!

699
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,080
- I'm looking site.
- I gave the address, bunny!

700
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,880
It was not right, has
a school here.

701
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,720
- What school?
- The municipal Ouempster.

702
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,240
- Then you're in the right place.
- Really?

703
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,560
<i>The school will be closed.</i>

704
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,840
<i>The old man opened a yarn
the Ministry of Education.</i>

705
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,600
- Really?
- Start the demolition immediately.

706
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,240
Exciting news.

707
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,320
Skiter;
The Ouenti am.

708
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,880
Aderfoula!

709
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,280
How are you?

710
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,760
- Children are okay?
- We magnificent!

711
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,080
Bobby impressive, but his uncle may
to jump across the couch.

712
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,600
- Can I talk to?
- Key not go camping.

713
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,520
- No?
- Good to spend in Arizona!

714
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,360
Camp Can
to tsimpisoun tsouknides!

715
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,600
- Go. Quiet!
- Where are we going?

716
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,680
Somewhere separately!

717
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,840
Go, go.

718
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,080
<i>I do not know but said the Bagksi
kotsidakia has hair!</i>

719
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,520
We have a camp!

720
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,720
Look what he has done!

721
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,440
Be careful with fire.

722
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,040
We do not want to listen.

723
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,880
I heard about it.

724
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,960
I saw in a magazine.

725
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,520
I imagined that it would be so good.

726
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,000
Hopefully, your mother and
will know that I gave you.

727
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,320
I would say.

728
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,760
We say to you.
This is the weakest link.

729
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,120
I will say this.

730
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,720
The mermaid is good!

731
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,160
- The what?
- Nothing.

732
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,920
When we were young and were
roof with your mom..

733
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,000
Dad told me to look at the
that stars and imagine something.

734
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,320
There. Look!

735
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,440
Looks like a camel. You see the
hunched and language hanging?

736
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,200
- I see.
- There! The pyramid!

737
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,640
Good, Patrick!

738
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,200
Next to the moon!

739
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,960
It looks like the Bagksi!

740
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,920
Do not worry, you have
older eyes.

741
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,200
- Uncle Skiter;
- Yes, beautiful.

742
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,280
Do you think my father
will turn back?

743
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,320
Difficult question..

744
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,400
We have some
mental impairment..

745
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,120
not want to be with you..

746
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,280
Every minute of the day.

747
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,400
A know.

748
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,080
You will always have your mother and
this girl to make friends.

749
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,360
I Do not go anywhere.

750
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,360
OK? I like
dirt feet.

751
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,320
I will always be there.

752
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,520
Without you and late.
Are you happy?

753
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,600
Good to spend in
night school.

754
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,800
See you tomorrow!

755
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,760
The xefortothikame under the
forks, story hour!

756
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,280
The story will be tonight
is special.

757
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,640
Apparently, the story of the great
concept for the hotel!

758
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,920
- What?
- Boring.

759
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,480
We need to do, help
my life too. Please?

760
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,440
We have another night. Say
a pleasant story tonight.

761
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,640
How about a story
Ivil Kanivel type;

762
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,480
With races, leaps,
Flights..

763
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,960
Or something romantic.

764
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,600
I have an idea. Let us combine
action and romantic..

765
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,600
and to create a
dromantiki history.

766
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,840
Let us begin.

767
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,400
<i>The biggest hero in Ancient
Greece was of course the Skiterklis.</i>

768
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,360
<i>It was really terrible.
And totally underestimated.</i>

769
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,800
<i>In ignored for years.</i>

770
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,880
<i>finally had the opportunity to show
his abilities in the vast arena.</i>

771
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,120
<i>If impressed his daughter
Emperor would overrule any day!</i>

772
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,480
Run!

773
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,120
- Is good.
- For peasant..

774
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,160
<i>see London, France,
gold my underwear!</i>

775
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,360
But what?

776
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,120
Bring elephants!

777
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,920
<i>You know that Heracles invented
the Olympic Games;</i>

778
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,160
<i>The Skiterklis invented
extreme sports!</i>

779
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,160
You will not succeed!

780
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,680
Did you like?

781
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,840
How come so far?

782
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,280
- The best so far!
- Make a little romance now?

783
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,680
<i>Tell me you. It was
girl after this;</i>

784
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,600
In such stories
always done so.

785
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,240
The said! So it is!

786
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,280
After? Dipsane, go to drink?

787
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,200
<i>Yes, go into a tavern.
Guess who it is.</i>

788
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,880
The Lent Zepelin.
Tell me, please.

789
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,640
Not all girls who were poor
in Skiterkli when small.

790
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,280
Nobody was bad with him,
was the first at school.

791
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,240
Others said the mom.

792
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,600
Okay, everybody was poor with him!
He had problems.

793
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,440
Tell your story.

794
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:23,600
<i>saw it with the beautiful
girl and zilepsan too.</i>

795
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,040
<i>not so much
knew what to do.</i>

796
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,720
<i>began to make nerve
the choki-poki.</i>

797
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,240
<i>Put the right hand tools
and right hand off..</i>

798
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,760
<i>Put the right hand tools
kuna and around!</i>

799
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,200
OK..

800
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,880
<i>And then came the Skiterklis
girl on the beach.</i>

801
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,600
<i>Suddenly a huge
hairy guy..</i>

802
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,200
<i>xevrastike shore.</i>

803
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,560
- Why hairy, not catch.
- So.

804
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,120
<i>had something stuck in throat
and could not breathe.</i>

805
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,080
Thanks.

806
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,640
It is good.

807
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,120
After started raining and
arrived in a magical cave.

808
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,200
- Nice of the caves.
- And Lincoln was there.

809
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,480
The Lincoln;
Is funny to you?

810
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,120
What happens?

811
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,240
Sorry..

812
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,200
The Lincoln, a good idea.

813
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,040
But it takes kiss?
It should not take?

814
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,040
He had long and the lips..

815
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,080
It was very dry.
After not using.

816
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,760
Bagksi with you copy?

817
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,320
You are a beautiful girl
in the region?

818
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,440
- You Skiter sir?
- Yes!

819
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,760
Sorry for the Ferrari the other day.

820
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,920
I am on the beach now and I
a feeling that you wanted to come.

821
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,040
What do little to eat;

822
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,280
That sounds good but I can,
go to Las Vegas.

823
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,880
Nobody said to Vegas.

824
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,400
Princess, I thought
we find ourselves today.

825
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
See you at the party
my father.

826
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,840
So tomorrow will be?
I can live with it..

827
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,480
Watch!

828
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,440
Are you okay?

829
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,720
Sorry!

830
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,120
What I said to
pillow protection;

831
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,800
- There had to be at school?
- To work should be looking.

832
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,920
For some reason I felt that
had to go to the beach.

833
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,360
Hungry?

834
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,160
Still hungry when pains.

835
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,960
Well, kernao.

836
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,720
I 'leave because I was robbed of the
wallet, how to pay?

837
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,480
- Natural and stole!
- I do not understand what you mean.

838
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,600
Always have something.

839
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,280
- Are you wearing my hat.
- Do not wear any hat.

840
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,240
Hey, look there.

841
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,320
It is the Skiter Bronson;

842
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,920
- Stop.
- My God!

843
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,160
Skiter! Hi!

844
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,440
Remember me? I am The Danny
Hein from high school.

845
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,800
I knew that going to meet.

846
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,720
It is very strange!

847
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,720
When designing the
the high school reunion!

848
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,760
For you talk.

849
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,600
We for you guys.

850
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,600
You can pretend that
you're my little girl?

851
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,440
With nothing.

852
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,280
It will convert truck
moving biodiesel.

853
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,640
Ok.

854
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,000
From here my girl, Jill.

855
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,000
Hi!

856
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,520
- Is your girlfriend?
- Yes.

857
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,080
I am.

858
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,920
He thinks that I am..

859
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,480
- Romantic.
- She likes how I am.

860
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,320
And filao well, says..

861
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,560
Yes, it is..
Enough.

862
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,040
You are very beautiful.

863
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,320
Good is. I have seen
and most beautiful but..

864
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,000
And so impossible.

865
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,560
In much of you.

866
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,480
I feel terrible.

867
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,680
We were terrible in Skiter
in high school, a mess.

868
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,560
- So bad..
- In Skiter me?

869
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,000
You had difficulty in high school?

870
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,280
Look at now! Done
very cute!

871
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,040
They left the pimples and they came.

872
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,040
- Want to catch?
- Never mind later.

873
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,200
<i>Put the right hand tools
and right hand off..</i>

874
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,520
<i>Put the right hand tools
kuna and around!</i>

875
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,440
Better to go.

876
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,160
I spoke with Ouenti.

877
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,600
Eager to see the children.
Not again miss so much.

878
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,000
Right..

879
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,560
It is my last
night with the children.

880
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,720
We destroyed.
In love!

881
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,600
And these fantastic
tales they say..

882
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,400
Those saying all good things.

883
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,560
My God! It is unconscious?

884
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,360
Yes, yes..

885
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,440
Thanks.

886
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,920
- The main perfect!
- What I do!

887
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,480
- You go from the rain?
- What rain?

888
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,040
- Came from?
- It is not imaginary;

889
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,360
Go!

890
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,000
I predict the future.

891
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,920
Well..

892
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,280
The presentation is tomorrow, right?
I know that it's cool but..

893
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,440
- Good luck anyway.
- Thank you.

894
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,440
You can come if you want,
is a party..

895
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,560
The Ouenti will watch the children,
you can go have some fun.

896
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,880
Yes..

897
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,720
Could.
To meet..

898
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,120
After night school.

899
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,200
- Are you?
- What?

900
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,480
The most beautiful girl in the region.

901
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,880
The most equitable;

902
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,600
No, beautiful.

903
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,200
Wait. Something strange will happen.

904
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,120
- It is wrong.
- No, no!

905
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,280
Not between us, I mean..

906
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,920
No!

907
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,440
Now!

908
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,760
Look!

909
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,080
One cent.

910
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,600
This is strange to say.
Abraham Lincoln.

911
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,720
Yes.

912
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,720
We will not stop us again,
was!

913
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,960
I had to finish better
stay, we lose!

914
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,680
Great imagination, Patrick..

915
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,560
We have a situation
shaving there.

916
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,440
Do not worry,
made blades.

917
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,400
It is not their father here, had
learn how to be shaved.

918
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,680
I am the princess smooth.

919
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,040
Are you ready for the great
play tomorrow night?

920
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,520
Yes. Just say the
My story tonight..

921
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,480
if win in history, will
and win really.

922
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,880
I understand, is like a positive display.
I read a book once.

923
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,840
The back at least..

924
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,360
I do not know to read.

925
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,520
Shut up, Bagksi!

926
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,720
I antitaktous thumbs,
how they feel about it?

927
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,240
Get ready, because it comes
our last story.

928
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,520
The fate of the universe
hanging by a thread..

929
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,720
<i>As the supreme council Galactic
convened to decide..</i>

930
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,560
<i>who will control the new world
solar system in Nottingham.</i>

931
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:25,440
<i>Most waited the leader
Barakto would prefer the..</i>

932
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,400
<i>General Kendall.</i>

933
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,560
<i>In hateful commander
the Optelioum.</i>

934
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,600
<i>But there was another
ace in the game.</i>

935
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,840
<i>The cloisters Bronsonian and her
of Mickey asbestos, asbestos Kouiki.</i>

936
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,320
<i>All watching anxiously.</i>

937
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,320
<i>The lieutenant Tzili..</i>

938
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,600
<i>The Aspenoth and the great
Bagkso captain.</i>

939
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,880
Following is a different race should
talking like alien!

940
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,080
It is disgusting, I will translate.

941
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,960
Quiet!

942
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,960
The leader of the new world
decided the traditional way.

943
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,080
In a match of zero gravity.

944
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,680
<i>reached the point that
everyone came to see.</i>

945
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,520
<i>In Skete Kendall to win.</i>

946
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,000
<i>Let us look first battle.</i>

947
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,520
<i>Kendall made the first move.</i>

948
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,760
<i>But the children want to see
the cloisters to the breaks, right;</i>

949
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,840
Boring!

950
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,520
Bring the monster!

951
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,520
We throw up..

952
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,280
<i>Well, let the monster
Kendall hit!</i>

953
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,280
<i>No, I think we should
to kiss me.</i>

954
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,520
<i>will put to the cloisters
you win;</i>

955
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,040
<i>OK.</i>

956
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,480
Get up, Skete!

957
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,560
Sheriff of Nottingham!

958
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,200
The perfect finish
the last story.

959
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,320
Thanks guys.

960
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,760
- Not over.
- It was very obvious way.

961
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,880
What do you mean?

962
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,480
Someone threw a ball of fire
the cloisters and incinerated.

963
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,640
End.

964
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,600
Incinerated;

965
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,800
No! You can
to catch fire!

966
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,840
I am the cloisters.
On fire!

967
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,920
You can finish it!
What happened to the happy ending?

968
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,680
You said that the happy end
not happening really..

969
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,040
We wanted the story to be true.

970
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,480
So I said!
I was a simpleton!

971
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,240
You burn really?

972
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,080
Do not sleep, stop.
Wake up!

973
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,400
We believe that we told you.
Surely a coincidence..

974
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,680
the new hotel will
built here.

975
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,480
Where is the school.

976
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,720
I am sure..
Sorry.

977
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,480
<i>Everything is ready for
presentation tonight.</i>

978
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,080
Good.

979
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,800
The good news is that we
win the competition.

980
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,600
The bad is that rather
will catch fire.

981
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,720
No. But if I take
some precautions.

982
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,240
Oven gloves..

983
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,160
Refractory spray Christmas tree.

984
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,040
Yes, yes..

985
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,800
Excuse me, this is
Christmas trees.

986
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,400
I know..

987
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,760
Sorry.

988
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,480
Hot!

989
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,160
To remedy.

990
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,720
It is on trees!

991
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,000
Sorry!

992
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,400
Antibacterial wipes one?

993
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,000
Easy..

994
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,160
Ice cream?

995
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,360
We will turn to fire?
In look, honey.

996
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,600
No fire will melt.
Just eat ice cream.

997
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,240
- It was nice.
- What?

998
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,760
In Pool launched.

999
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,280
No, jumped alone.
Have you seen the Jill?

1000
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,440
No.

1001
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,640
- I'm cold.
- Will bring towel!

1002
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,120
I brought her!

1003
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,240
Sorry.

1004
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,360
I love you.

1005
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,840
I brought that
The sandwich, huh?

1006
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,640
Are you okay?

1007
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,520
A bee in my own language!

1008
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:05,280
The meeting for the new hotel
will be in the living room.

1009
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,080
You will not want to miss.

1010
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,000
- To sit there, mate?
- Yes, of course.

1011
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,480
- Do not touch.
- Sorry.

1012
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,400
Before I begin
to say, personally..

1013
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,440
Happy Birthday.

1014
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,280
Thanks Kendall.

1015
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,080
As you can see, invited some
of staff to come..

1016
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,480
to see your ideas as
"commoner, without misunderstanding.

1017
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,600
No, Barry.

1018
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,360
Gentlemen, who wants to start?

1019
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,360
Ok.

1020
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,280
Mr Nottingham, had
absolutely right when you said..

1021
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,160
that the issue of rock 'n roll
was obsolete.

1022
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,120
He goes.

1023
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,280
The vision has inspired you
to dig deeper..

1024
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,960
To find a truism in
heart of the American experience.

1025
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,680
Of course I am talking about
the musical theater.

1026
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,160
And more specifically..

1027
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,880
Broadway!

1028
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,320
Go!

1029
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,880
Original, impressive, bravo!

1030
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,440
- Thank you Kendall.
- Thank you sir.

1031
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,160
Sorry about that.

1032
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,000
Just xekouraza my eyes..

1033
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,120
Skiter series you.

1034
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,640
Are you okay?

1035
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,520
Excuse me?

1036
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,360
A bee tsimpise"
my language. "

1037
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,240
In understand?

1038
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,800
How the tsimpise;

1039
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,520
It was in a ice cream
and egleipse.

1040
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,680
Can translate the
presentation for us?

1041
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,760
Yes, I can.

1042
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,760
I spent the last week
the hotel stay.

1043
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,280
With my nephews.

1044
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:45,440
For children, everything here
is strange and wonderful.

1045
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,360
To sleep in a bed..

1046
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,040
To go to the interior..

1047
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,360
To pidane more or less
the alligator..

1048
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,400
To bob in the elevator..

1049
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,280
Now I understand that the alligator
kollage not the other.

1050
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,040
Somewhat stories, they did to
like home, as it were.

1051
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,760
But losing the meaning.

1052
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,360
If you want to stay somewhere like
home, why not leave at home?

1053
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,000
To escape from the everyday.

1054
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,200
I would like to capture
the new hotel.

1055
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,120
What we know each child and
every adult has forgotten.

1056
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,240
As my father told me..

1057
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,520
The entertainment you limited
only by your imagination.

1058
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:20,080
What was it? Sorry..
I do not understand.

1059
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,480
It was brilliant!

1060
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,280
Congratulations boy,
won the key of the kingdom!

1061
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,520
Do not do this!

1062
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,320
Germs!

1063
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,440
Congratulations!

1064
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,440
Congratulations, it was unlikely!

1065
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,000
Terrible.

1066
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,640
Congratulations Skiter.

1067
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,320
- No evil.
- Of course not.

1068
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,600
The deserved. You are better than
me, have an iron will.

1069
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,880
So they say.

1070
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,200
You will not have the guts to demolish
go to school my nephews.

1071
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,960
What?

1072
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,800
You know that there will be built in
new hotel;

1073
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,000
- What do you think?
- Good show!

1074
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:26,080
This language has bee
made me support it.

1075
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,400
Good. I want to talk
for the location..

1076
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,640
Bronson, fired!

1077
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,640
Thus linked..

1078
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,680
Do you know which is the class
of Jill?

1079
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,360
There.

1080
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,800
Why not in apantages
my calls?

1081
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,920
Because I knew that was you.

1082
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,480
You have to believe,
I had no idea..

1083
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,400
Do not spoil the little respect I have
for you with cheap excuses.

1084
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,320
Just..

1085
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,880
Get away and stay away.

1086
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:50,680
Want to apotefrosoume school
because kapsame in history?

1087
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,160
We will do this!

1088
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,200
We thought that you are good.

1089
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,120
Me too.

1090
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,720
The cloisters Kendall wins.

1091
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,440
Nah..

1092
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,680
Welcome.

1093
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,800
- You 're mad with me?
- Not as Jill, but..

1094
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,760
- Mad, yes.
- I did not know that we built there!

1095
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,125
- I understand.
- Why Are you mad?

1096
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,040
Because I gave the children
rough food?

1097
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,600
And understand this.

1098
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,960
Thymosa why..

1099
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,600
children told me that the real
reality there is no happy ending.

1100
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,840
Look around you! See
happy end here;

1101
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,840
I do not know.

1102
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,800
You and Dad always pernagate
so well in this room.

1103
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,880
For some reason I have not,
I was always cynical..

1104
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,640
- The sad..
- The black cloud..

1105
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,560
the whirlpool action..
The dead fish.

1106
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,000
All of them.

1107
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,040
When the children left with you
I had hoped that would xesikoseis.

1108
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,080
That will do
have fun.

1109
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,760
Dad would like it to.

1110
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,120
I found a job in Arizona
teacher, not the director.

1111
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,000
Please come when installed.

1112
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,400
Until then we want
children to see.

1113
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,560
I love you.

1114
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,920
<i>And so the Skiter sat in bed
the deeply repentant..</i>

1115
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,880
<i>and wondered how
symmazepsei life..</i>

1116
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,880
<i>After a magical week.</i>

1117
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,560
Great end, huh?

1118
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,600
<i>That was the end of your son;</i>

1119
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,800
<i>thought that was the sad part
and were ready to corrections.</i>

1120
01:19:21,835 --> 01:19:23,600
What do you mean?
What to do?

1121
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,600
<i>As I said, when the stories
things seem hopeless..</i>

1122
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,880
<i>The hero would do something
unexpected and brave..</i>

1123
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,400
<i>to defeat the evil, to save
tomorrow and get the girl.</i>

1124
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,080
Yes, how would you do that?

1125
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,400
<i>Yours is the story. Hurry
But. Top their son!</i>

1126
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,800
Mr Nottingham!

1127
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,720
Do you speak for a moment?

1128
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,880
I am Jill Hastings, teacher
in primary Ouempster..

1129
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:04,160

Mr. Bronson, as
conscientious citizen..

01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,440
I wanted to draw attention
before I take hasty decisions.

1146
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:09,160

We need to find a window
