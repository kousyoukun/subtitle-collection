1
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,996
<i>[Man] I'm going
to tell you a story now.</i>

2
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:39,564
<i>But as any good storyteller knows,</i>

3
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:43,237
<i>one must first be sure
the audience is prepared.</i>

4
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:45,712
<i>Is everybody comfortably seated?</i>

5
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,045
<i>Does anyone need to use the bathroom?</i>

6
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:51,211
<i>Oh. You, sir, in the back?</i>

7
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:53,187
<i>Well, hold it in.</i>

8
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:55,451
<i>[Laughs]</i>

9
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:58,152
<i>You ready? Here we go.</i>

10
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,997
<i>My name is Marty Bronson.</i>

11
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:08,059
<i>I owned and operated
the Sunny Vista Motel,</i>

12
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:11,766
<i>which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards</i>

13
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:16,904
<i>in Los Angeles, California,
in the year 1974.</i>

14
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,506
<i>The motel was my labor of love,</i>

15
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,416
<i>and I ran it with the help
of my children: Wendy...</i>

16
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:27,684
[Marty] Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. And Mrs. Dixon.

17
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:30,014
Thank you.

18
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:31,218
<i>And Skeeter.</i>

19
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,790
May I help you with your bags,
Mr. And Mrs. Dixon?

20
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:39,334
- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.

21
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:43,631
[Grunting]

22
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:45,230
You, uh, need a hand?

23
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:47,071
No, no. I got it.

24
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,472
[Mr. Dixon] OK.

25
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:55,047
<i>To my boy Skeeter,
the motel was a wonderland.</i>

26
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:56,778
Way too hyper.

27
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,412
The galaxy's not big enough
for the both of us.

28
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:00,978
<i>A magical place.</i>

29
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:04,026
[Chatter, laughter]

30
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:07,529
<i>Full of new adventures
for a six-year-old boy.</i>

31
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:12,193
[Laughs] Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

32
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,601
<i>Skeeter loved the old place
as much as I did.</i>

33
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:22,110
<i>And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better.</i>

34
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:25,477
I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.

35
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:29,382
I was thinking we could put
an extra pair of socks in each room

36
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:33,183
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

37
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,680
That's a good idea.

38
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:38,158
Time for bed,
I'm meeting with Mr. Nottingham.

39
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:40,821
Wait, Dad. I'm not even tired.

40
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:44,297
Well, how about a bedtime story?

41
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,698
Yay!

42
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:53,371
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

43
00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:56,070
and that little boy's name
was Skeeter.

44
00:02:56,145 --> 00:03:00,878
<i>Well, I could tell a pretty fair tale
when the muse was with me.</i>

45
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,248
<i>And making my little boy smile,</i>

46
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,753
<i>now, that was truly magical.</i>

47
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:10,758
<i>Yeah, I was a pretty good dad
and a pretty good host.</i>

48
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:15,195
<i>But unfortunately,
a pretty bad businessman.</i>

49
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:18,165
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

50
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:20,702
This motel is sinking in red ink...

51
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,068
and I'm offering you the last lifeboat.

52
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,073
[Sighs]

53
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,631
I don't know.

54
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,870
[Nottingham]
I've seen the books, Martin.

55
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:32,107
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

56
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:33,978
Yes, well, I...

57
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,246
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

58
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,980
[Nottingham] How about this?

59
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:42,353
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

60
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:44,416
I'll let him run this place.

61
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:47,125
[Sighs] You promise?

62
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:50,461
Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.

63
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,107
That's my boy, Bronson.

64
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:03,839
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

65
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:07,849
It's going to be uptight
and out of sight.

66
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:12,718
<i>[Marty] And just like that,
our modest little Sunny Vista Motel...</i>

67
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:17,555
<i>... metamorphosized into the
mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.</i>

68
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:20,060
<i>And for the past 25 years,</i>

69
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,530
<i>it has been lovingly maintained
by my now grown-up son,</i>

70
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,432
<i>Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.</i>

71
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:29,801
<i>Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's promise
for Skeeter to run the place</i>

72
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:32,397
<i>- seems to have been forgotten...
- Hiya, Pop.</i>

73
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:36,070
<i>... my boy always works diligently
with a hopeful heart,</i>

74
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:38,010
<i>still waiting for his shot.</i>

75
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,947
Mrs. Dixon?
Is there a problem with her room?

76
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:43,712
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

77
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:47,381
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

78
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:48,787
and doesn't want to pay for it.

79
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:51,850
I never even touched
that evil little refrigerator.

80
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,827
I don't drink alcohol.

81
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,830
Of course.
There's probably a mix-up.

82
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:58,264
- I saw who took it.
- OK.

83
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,461
He had red hair and a beard.

84
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:03,027
He was wearing a green suit
with brass buttons.

85
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:05,539
And he stands about ten inches tall.

86
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:08,202
So we're talking about a leprechaun?

87
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:09,301
There you go.

88
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:11,846
Oh, I didn't know your brother
was in town.

89
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:14,144
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

90
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:17,652
Put all the missing bottles
on my tab.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,450
Next time you see any leprechauns,
we'll tell Aspen.

92
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:21,581
She's half-troll.

93
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:24,125
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

94
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,854
[Scoffs]

95
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,190
She would.

96
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:32,334
<i>[Marty] Today magic is
in the air at the grand hotel,</i>

97
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,926
<i>and the winds of change
are about to blow our story</i>

98
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:37,302
<i>in a strange new direction.</i>

99
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:39,307
<i>But what would you expect in a hotel</i>

100
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,344
<i>founded by someone who loved
a good story as much as I?</i>

101
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:44,709
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.

102
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,511
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

103
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:49,915
Of course.

104
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:52,977
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.

105
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:55,353
- [Feedback]
- Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

106
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:58,416
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

107
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:00,086
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.

108
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:02,221
I say "Barry,"
you say "Nottingham."

109
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,027
- Barry.
- [All] Nottingham.

110
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,657
- Barry.
- [All] Nottingham.

111
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,861
<i># Barry had a Nottingham</i>

112
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:10,201

00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,001

115
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,677
[laughs] Come on,
give it up for the big man.

116
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:19,077
[Applause]

117
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:20,672
Got them warmed up for you, sir.

118
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:23,115
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.

119
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:24,209
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,

120
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:26,413
Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...

121
00:06:26,488 --> 00:06:27,853
Not a fear, an awareness...

122
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:30,517
...of germs and
how dangerous they can be

123
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:33,926
when not properly... feared, so...

124
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:36,396
You're doing the right thing.
I didn't shower today.

125
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,228
So, yeah, let me get out of here.

126
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,962
[Skeeter] Barry Nottingham, everybody.

127
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:46,572
- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- [Barry] Welcome.

128
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:51,602
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

129
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,739
But it's no secret that this one,

130
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:57,013
the Sunny Vista Nottingham,
is my favorite.

131
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,020
However, this is a 20th-century hotel.

132
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:07,290
We need something for the 21 st century.

133
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:10,764
And so, we have decided
to close this hotel

134
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:15,861
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

135
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:18,566
[Applause]

136
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:22,008
This will be the largest hotel
on the West Coast.

137
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:25,672
I simply don't understand what the fuss
is about. It's just a big building.

138
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:28,512
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

139
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:32,247
...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

140
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,852
Yes!

141
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:40,827
So I'm proud to announce
the new hotel's general manager.

142
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:43,956
He's been waiting on this
for a long time.

143
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:48,163
We all know how hard he works,
how intelligent he is,

144
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:50,671
how much this hotel means to him.

145
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:53,833
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!

146
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,176
Take a bow, Kendall.

147
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,474
- God bless.
- Boo!

148
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:00,981
[Hissing]

149
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,712
[Man] A beautiful speech, sir.
A beautiful speech.

150
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:05,777
I'm so glad you could come.

151
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:07,651
It's great to see you.

152
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:09,156
Don't touch me.

153
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,555
Well done, Daddy.

154
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:15,863
Oh, oh, hello there.
Do you know my daughter, Violet?

155
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,865
Only by reputation, sir.

156
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,628
Excuse me?

157
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:22,500
No, no, not that she has a reputation.

158
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:24,038
I always heard she's very hot.

159
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,670
Not hot as in hot.

160
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:28,710
Hot, I meant warm...
Warm-hearted.

161
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:32,679
And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,

162
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:35,979
in bars, with a lot
of different guys, and...

163
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:39,020
That's the old Violet Nottingham.
Before she met me.

164
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:41,818
Now it's up to me to keep
my pooky-bear out of the spotlight

165
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,485
and nightclubs and tabloids.
Isn't that right, sir? [chuckles]

166
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:48,496
Violet's off to her private tennis
lesson with Roger Federer.

167
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:51,226
- Oh. All right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.

168
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,962
Got to say, uh...

169
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:57,597
...it's gonna be hard for me to see
the hotel move locations like this.

170
00:08:57,673 --> 00:09:01,109
Well, I, I do hope you'll feel able
to come and work with us there.

171
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,201
Big as Kendall wants to make it,

172
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,042
well, there's going to be a lot
of light bulbs to change.

[Snickering]

174
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,510
Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?

175
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:12,076
There is, sir. Come this way.
I'll get you some.

176
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:13,917
Can't be too careful, Kendall.

Thank you, Principal Duva.

Oh, I'm not a principal
at this party. I'm a mom.

Hey!

I notice no one's eating

Come on. Trust me,
you just got to get past the smell.

187
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:51,490
What? The clown died?

- Hey, sissy.

191
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:04,530
Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled
crud to my house every time you visit?

192
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:07,632
What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.

193
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,143
What are you talking about?
It hasn't been four years.

194
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,305
You were here for
The Fourth of July barbecue

195
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,678
when you punched my husband?

196
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:16,513
Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,

197
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:18,314
but his underwear had holes in it.

198
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:21,185
I knew he'd be your ex-husband.
You should be happy.

199
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:22,621
All right. Let's not start.

200
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:24,283
How are the kids handling

201

the old divorce anyways?

202

They're both kind of off right now.
Bobbi's been really quiet.

Why don't you go say hi.
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy.

- Is that what stinks in here?
- No, it's the cake.

205
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:35,966
What did she make, donkey cake?

206

Hey, you guys. Remember me?

Man, you got big.
Haven't seen you in a while.

Yes, yes.

221
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:17,601
And a soap?

222
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,678
Hanger and a towel.

223
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,774
Do not talk about school with them.

224
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:25,149
What's going on with the school?

225
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,245
- They're closing it down.
- No.

- I'm getting laid off.
- You?

227

You're like

228
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,189
I mean, you're, you're scary
and bad with people.

229
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:36,856
Children are nervous around you.

230
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:40,333
That doesn't sound right, but,
I'm just saying, what else could you do?

231
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:44,202
Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the bogeyman.
You could be the bogeyman.

- Anyway...
- What, what?

233
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:48,033
I've got some interviews
set up in Arizona,

234
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,635
which is kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

235
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:52,179
Uh-oh.

236
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:54,841
I need you to watch the kids...
for a week.

237
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,852
No! No, they don't even like me!

238
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,751
It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter.

239
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:01,721
My friend Jill
is a teacher at my school.

240
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,021
She'll bring the kids in with her
and watch them till dinnertime.

241
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:06,720
All you gotta do is the night shift.

242
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,456
Why can't your stupid friend do that?

243
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,260
She's got night school. Skeeter!

244
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,824
My husband left me.
I'm getting laid off.

245
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:16,962
I, I have to move.
I need your help.

246
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,633
So you need me.
This is good.

247
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,005
I'll do it.

248
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:22,771
But you got to say,

249
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:24,812
"Skeeter is the coolest.
I am a nerd."

250
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,745
"Skeeter's the coolest.
I'm a nerd?"

251
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:29,978
Yeah, you are! Whoo!

252
00:12:30,052 --> 00:12:31,349
OK. Hey, you guys.

253
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,684
I'm going to hang out with you
this week. All right?

254
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:35,552
Maybe we can go... fishing.

255
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,491
I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.

256
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,891
OK, we'll stay inside.

257
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,987
How about, uh,
we play some poker?

258
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:45,227
- I can teach you that.
- Gambling? I don't think so.

259
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,825
OK, how about we
just take walks in the park

260
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:50,997
- and catalog plant species?
- Now you're talking.

261
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:52,734
I don't know anything about plants

262
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:54,742
except you try to make cakes
out of them!

He liked that one.
I'm gonna end with a laugh.

264
00:12:57,012 --> 00:13:00,175
Give me some. Huh?

265
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:03,149
I wasn't gonna hit you.
I was trying to do the fist thing.

266
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:04,947
You don't know the fist thing?

267
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,487
OK, I was just...

268
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:09,947
That's what, uh, the children do.

269
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,024
Hey, yeh, yeh.

270
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:16,831
Oh, this your truck, chief?

271
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:18,593
Yes, it is, ma'am.

272
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,158
You realize you're taking up
two parking spaces?

273
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,931
It's a big truck, ma'am.

274
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:25,701
It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.

275
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:27,799
I had to park
all the way down the block.

276
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,709
Well, next time park in that box.
Plenty of room in there.

277
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,875
Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,

278
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,043
this is the hotel I work for's truck.

279
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:40,179
So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.

280
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:43,122
So two parking spaces
provides me with what I call

281
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:46,627
"a cushion of protection."

I'm the day shift.

286
00:13:57,072 --> 00:14:01,805
OK, June. You plan on being
this hostile the whole time?

287
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:03,674
Jill. My name is Jill.

288

Do you plan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?

Anyways, you're in my
cushion of protection right now.

296
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:32,130
I want to back up, so if you
could just zing-zang up there,

297
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:35,074
- that would be helpful.
- Yeah.

298

You'll need it.

Give it back!
Somebody owes me six bucks!

301
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:49,652
So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hotel?

302
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,021
He promised your dad.

303
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,459
I wanted to.
It just wasn't the right time.

304
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:54,893
Let me tell you how it works.

305
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,726
The big man's giving the job
to Kendall

306
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,356
because he's dating his daughter.

307
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,594
That's the way it works,
keep it in the family.

308

OK. Yeah, yeah,

a little too much of a cruel joke

00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:38,239

Uh... that was the sleep
panic disorder, I believe.

929
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:41,300
Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.

930
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncle a kiss.

931
00:46:43,436 --> 00:46:45,768
I'm a relative, I deserve it.
Right there.

932
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,534
Oh, that felt nice.

933
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:49,541
How about one more for the road?

934
00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:53,272
- No.
- Come on, baby!

935
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:56,008
Don't worry, we'll be back tonight.

936
00:46:56,082 --> 00:46:57,515
Yeah, no, I'm not worried.

937
00:46:57,584 --> 00:46:59,984
You're coming back,
we got a big story tonight!

938
00:47:00,053 --> 00:47:03,750
About some hotel theme ideas!
Yeah!

939
00:47:03,823 --> 00:47:06,519
- Maybe we won't come back.
- What?

940
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:09,153
- Skeeter?
- Sir Butt-Kiss. Sir... Kendall.

941
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:13,962
I understand that you feel a need
to prepare for our little... showdown.

942
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:15,865
- Yeah.
- That does not excuse you

943
00:47:15,935 --> 00:47:17,698
from maintenance responsibilities.

944
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:19,705
- Oh, no. Check.
- Lights are out in the spa.

945
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:22,207
- The south service elevator is slow.
- Check.

946
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,833
Let me try that cheesecake.

947
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:27,579
Oh, another thing.

948
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:31,879
I heard about your big hero act
with my girlfriend last night.

949
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:34,920
- This paparazzi was...
- I know what it is you're trying to do,

950
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,751
and it's not gonna work.

951
00:47:36,823 --> 00:47:38,381
You have to find another way

952
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:41,222
to cozy up to the old man
because I'm here to tell you

953
00:47:41,294 --> 00:47:45,526
Violet Nottingham is not gonna
date a gum-scraping handyman.

954
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:49,392
Hey, Kendall.

955
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:54,838
Two things. First off,
you got something right there.

956
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:59,004
Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.

957
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:02,515
Good. Secondly, when I get
the job at the new hotel,

958
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:06,746
I was actually considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.

959
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:11,785
Your brief little trip
to the land of make-believe

960
00:48:11,858 --> 00:48:14,053
is just about over, my friend. OK?

961
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:17,426
We all know your failed father
ran this hotel into the ground,

962
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:20,159
and thankfully, you will not
get the chance to make

963
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,030
the same mistake all over again.

964
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:25,569
May want to pick that up.

Saw them in magazines.

I never imagined they
would be this good.

Let's just hope your mother
doesn't find out I gave you any.

- I won't tell her.
- I'm not talking about you.

and your mom and I were out on the roof,

1009
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:34,830
my dad would always tell us
to look at the stars

00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:39,065
and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...

We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.

1049
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:38,388
How about some Evel Knievel stuff?

00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:41,859
Racing, jumping, flying...

1051
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:44,328

[Kissing sounds, chitters]

1053

I have a good idea.

1054
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:51,062
Let's combine the action
and the romance

1055
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:53,799
and make a romaction story.

The greatest of all the heroes

1058
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:02,047
was, of course, Skeetacus.

<i>Finally Skeetacus had his chance
to show his skills in the grand arena.</i>

1062
00:53:17,697 --> 00:53:20,393
<i>If he could impress the
daughter of the emperor,</i>

1063
00:53:20,466 --> 00:53:23,594
<i>he knew he would one day rule the land.</i>

How we doing so far, huh?

- Can we get to the romance now?

Uh, right. So, what? They're thirsty?
They go off for drinks?

What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

- Thanks.
- He's OK.

1125
00:56:22,982 --> 00:56:26,179
And then it starts pouring,
so they run into a magical cave.

1126
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:29,221
- Caves are nice.
- And Abe Lincoln's there.

1127
00:56:29,288 --> 00:56:31,620
Abe Lincoln?
What, is this a joke to you?

1128
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:34,558
What the heck's the matter with you?
Oh, I'm sorry.

1129
00:56:34,627 --> 00:56:35,821
I, I didn't mean to yell.

1130
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:38,386
The Abe Lincoln thing, that's,
that's a good idea.

Does Skeetacus get a kiss?

Don't you think he should?
It's... been a long time for him.

His lips are very dry
from not using them.

<i>- [Violet] Hello?

in the land?

1138
00:57:02,822 --> 00:57:04,847
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?

<i>Yes, it is. Sorry about that Ferrari
confusion the other night.</i>

1140

I'm here at the beach right now
and I had a hunch you might be here too.

1141
00:57:11,797 --> 00:57:13,560
What do you say
we get a little lunchsky?

1142
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:15,123
<i>That sounds so delightful.</i>

1143
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:18,227
But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.

1144
00:57:19,438 --> 00:57:20,666
Vegas?

1145
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,106
Uh, no one talked about Vegas.

1146
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:25,439
Don't tell Kendall.
He thinks I'm in the library.

1147
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:27,843
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,

1148
00:57:27,913 --> 00:57:30,108
I, I really thought we
were gonna hang out today.

1149
00:57:30,182 --> 00:57:32,912
Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.

1150
00:57:32,985 --> 00:57:33,974
<i>Bye, Skeeter.</i>

1151
00:57:35,187 --> 00:57:36,916
Hmm.

1152
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:40,015
So our date's gonna be tomorrow?
I can live with that.

1153
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:43,118
- Hey! Look out! Look out!
- [Both shouting]

1154
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:47,564
- [Skeeter groans]
- Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!

1155
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:50,864
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?

1156
00:57:50,936 --> 00:57:53,461
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

1157
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,404
I'm supposed to be
looking for a job now,

1158
00:57:55,474 --> 00:57:58,637
but for some reason I felt like
coming to the beach today.

1159
00:57:58,711 --> 00:57:59,939
Huh.

1160
00:58:00,012 --> 00:58:01,479
Um, are you hungry?

1161
00:58:01,547 --> 00:58:04,539
Yes, I'm always hungry
when I'm in pain.

1162
00:58:04,617 --> 00:58:06,710
Good. Because I'm buying.

1163
00:58:06,786 --> 00:58:09,550
I'll let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,

1164
00:58:09,622 --> 00:58:12,819
- so how was I gonna pay?
- Of course you got your wallet stolen.

1165
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:16,225
- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's always something with you.

1166
00:58:16,295 --> 00:58:18,126
- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.

1167
00:58:18,197 --> 00:58:20,722
- Gonna wear that all day?
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat.

1168
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,496
- I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
- I'll take it back. Thanks.

1169
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:25,901
[Chattering]

1170
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:31,706
This is perfect for your free lunch.

1171
00:58:31,777 --> 00:58:34,837
Oh, my gosh. You guys,
you guys, you guys. Over there.

1172
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:36,848
Is that...
is that Skeeter Bronson?

1173
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,383
- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.

1174
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:40,817
- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.

1175

Hey! Do you remember me?

1176
00:58:43,155 --> 00:58:46,056
It's Donna Hynde from high school.

1177
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,888
Yeah, I do.

1178
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,555
Thought I was going to run into you
shortly. And here you are.

1179
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,861
Yeah. Wow, this is so...
weird. Uh...

1180
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:57,402
We were just planning
our high school reunion.

1181
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:00,735
We were totally just talking about you.
It's so weird.

1182
00:59:00,806 --> 00:59:02,774
I was just talking about you guys too.

1183
00:59:02,842 --> 00:59:04,332
Sure, he was.

1184
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,072
Mind pretending to be
my girlfriend for a second?

1185
00:59:07,146 --> 00:59:09,080
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

1186
00:59:09,148 --> 00:59:11,514
I'll, uh, convert my truck to biodiesel.

1187
00:59:13,452 --> 00:59:14,942
- OK, I'll do it.
- Ding-dong.

Uh, this is my girlfriend,
guys. This is Jill.

Hello.

1190

- Right?
- Yup.

1194

She thinks I'm...

1195
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:31,868
You want me to...
Oh. Uh... romantic.

1196
00:59:31,937 --> 00:59:33,802
She likes how romantic I can be.

1197
00:59:33,873 --> 00:59:36,899
And, uh, "great kisser,"
she likes to say.

1198
00:59:36,976 --> 00:59:40,309
Oh, yeah. That's...
a little too much.

1199
00:59:40,379 --> 00:59:43,439
- Oh. Sorry.
- Wow, you are really pretty.

1200
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:45,814
- I mean, she's all right.
- Thanks.

1201
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:48,752
I've seen hotter,
but she's pretty cool.

1202
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:50,152
So super skinny.

1203
00:59:50,222 --> 00:59:53,851
Skinnier than you.
But... Yeah.

1204
00:59:55,227 --> 00:59:56,251
Whatever.

1205
00:59:56,328 --> 00:59:58,956
I feel really awful
saying this out loud.

1206
00:59:59,031 --> 01:00:03,798
We were really terrible to Skeeter
in high school. Awful. So mean.

01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:05,302
My Skeeter?

1208
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:07,771
- They were.
- You had a hard time in high school?

1209
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,503
Look at you now.
You turned out pretty... cute.

1210

- [Girls] Yeah!
- You know...

1211
01:00:13,212 --> 01:00:16,340
the pimples went away,
and, uh, these came to play.

1212
01:00:18,984 --> 01:00:20,849
- You want to touch them?
- Oh, that's OK.

1213

- Later, later.
- They're here for you. Ding-dong.

She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.

1228
01:00:55,721 --> 01:00:58,485
and those amazing bedtime stories
you've been telling them.

1229
01:00:58,557 --> 01:01:01,321
Oh, well, they say all the good parts.
I promise.

1230

Oh, my gosh.
Is he unconscious?

Yeah, yeah.

Boom! Oh.

1234
01:01:11,103 --> 01:01:12,400
Thanks!

1235
01:01:13,472 --> 01:01:14,632
Whoa!

1236
01:01:14,707 --> 01:01:16,572
- Yeah?
- Check out Mr. Smooth.

1237
01:01:16,642 --> 01:01:20,237
- Well, you know, I do what I do.
- [Both laughing]

1238
01:01:20,312 --> 01:01:22,872
- Think we should get out of this rain?
- What rain?

1239
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:25,473
[Thunder rumbling]

1240
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:27,280
Oh, shoot!
Where did that come from?

1241
01:01:27,353 --> 01:01:29,150
I don't know!
Isn't it amazing?

1242
01:01:29,221 --> 01:01:32,349
- Let's get out of this!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!

1243

[Jill screaming, laughing]

1244
01:01:34,326 --> 01:01:36,590
I can read the future.

1245
01:01:38,797 --> 01:01:41,925
Good God. So...

1246
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:46,267
So... The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?

1247
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:49,000
I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...

1248
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:50,405
good luck on it anyway.

1249
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:51,841
- Thank you.
- Yep.

1250
01:01:51,911 --> 01:01:56,245
Actually, you can come
if you want. It's like a party.

1251
01:01:56,315 --> 01:01:59,045
You know, Wendy's gonna be
watching the kids,

1252
01:01:59,118 --> 01:02:00,415
and we could have fun.

1253
01:02:00,486 --> 01:02:02,113
You can meet me there.

1254
01:02:03,155 --> 01:02:05,248
Yeah. That would, uh...

1255
01:02:05,324 --> 01:02:08,987
I could do that.
I could meet you, um...

1256
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:11,689
...after night school or something.

1257
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,692
It's you?

1258
01:02:15,768 --> 01:02:17,929
It's me what?

1259
01:02:19,538 --> 01:02:22,439
You're the fairest maiden in the land?

1260
01:02:24,476 --> 01:02:27,673
"Fair" as in
"doesn't cheat at checkers"?

1261
01:02:29,715 --> 01:02:32,183
No, fairest as in...

1262
01:02:33,786 --> 01:02:35,811
..."beautifulest."

1263
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:48,665
Wait, wait.
Something weird's gonna happen.

1264
01:02:49,735 --> 01:02:51,600
Oh.

1265
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:54,764
No, yeah, we don't...
This is a mistake.

1266
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,776
No, no, no, not between us.
I mean like, some...

1267
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:01,711
No! No, no!
Oh, here comes Abe!

1268
01:03:02,548 --> 01:03:04,311
No!

1269
01:03:13,192 --> 01:03:14,784
Ah! Look.

1270
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:18,286
- Wow, a penny.
- No, no, no.

1271
01:03:18,364 --> 01:03:21,458
This is the weird thing
I was talking about. Abe Lincoln.

1272
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:24,434
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

1273
01:03:24,503 --> 01:03:27,438
Abe's not gonna interrupt
this time. That was it.

1274
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:29,235
It's supposed to end better than this.

1275
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:32,368
Stick around. I'm tellin' ya,
you're gonna be missing out.

1276
01:03:34,013 --> 01:03:36,140
Nice imagination, Patrick.

1277
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:45,718
- Skeeter?
- Yo.

1278
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:48,521
We've got a little bit
of a shaving situation in there.

1279
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:50,926
Oh, no, no, no.
I took the razor blades out.

1280
01:03:50,996 --> 01:03:52,827
Don't worry. Their father ain't around,

1281
01:03:52,898 --> 01:03:55,059
I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.

1282
01:03:55,134 --> 01:03:56,624
[Kids giggling]

1283

I'm Princess Leia.

1284
01:03:59,204 --> 01:04:00,899
Uh-huh.

1285
01:04:02,674 --> 01:04:05,234
So, are you ready
for the big showdown tomorrow night?

1286
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:06,299
Oh, yeah.

1287
01:04:06,378 --> 01:04:07,675
What I'm going to do is

1288
01:04:07,746 --> 01:04:09,680
tell them a bedtime story tonight.

1289
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:12,546
I'll have me win in the story.

1290
01:04:12,618 --> 01:04:16,145
Then I'll win for reals.
Do you dig?

1291
01:04:16,221 --> 01:04:17,916
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.

1292
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:20,220
So it's like, um,
positive visualization.

1293
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:22,021
I read a book on that once.

1294
01:04:22,995 --> 01:04:25,293
Read the back cover, at least.

1295
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,697

I've got opposable thumbs.
How do you feel about that?

[Skeeter] You children ready?

1301
01:04:39,912 --> 01:04:42,642
Because here comes our last story.

1302
01:04:43,816 --> 01:04:46,512
The fate of the entire universe

1303
01:04:46,585 --> 01:04:48,416
hung in the balance,

1304
01:04:48,487 --> 01:04:50,751
as the Supreme Galactic Council

1305
01:04:50,823 --> 01:04:53,257
<i>met to determine who would control</i>

<i>the evil governor of Hotelium.</i>

Yeah. That would be too obvious.

What do you mean?

You said happy endings
don't really happen.

I can't believe
Skeeter didn't tell you.

1380
01:08:54,132 --> 01:08:57,124
And I'm sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hotel

All right, Kendall.
Yeah. No hard feelings, pal.

Of course not. You deserve it.

No, I figured you'd do that too.

so much fun in this room.

For whatever reason, I didn't.

you'd rub off on them.
