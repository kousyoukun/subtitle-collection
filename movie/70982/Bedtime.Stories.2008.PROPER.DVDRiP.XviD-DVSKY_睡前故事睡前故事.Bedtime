1
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,396
{\fs20}I'm going to tell you a story now.

2
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:39,964
{\fs20}But as any good storyteller knows,

3
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:43,637
{\fs20}one must first be sure
the audience is prepared.

4
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:46,112
{\fs20}Is everybody comfortably seated?

5
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,445
{\fs20}Does anyone need to use the bathroom?

6
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:51,611
{\fs20}Oh. You, sir, in the back?

7
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:53,587
{\fs20}Well, hold it in.

8
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,924
{\fs20}Ha ha ha

9
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,552
{\fs20}You ready? Here we go.

10
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,397
{\fs20}My name is Marty Bronson.

11
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:08,459
{\fs20}I owned and operated
the Sunny Vista Motel,

12
00:01:08,537 --> 00:01:12,166
{\fs20}which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards

13
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:17,304
{\fs20}in Los Angeles, California,
in the year 1974.

14
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,906
{\fs20}The motel was my labor of love,

15
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:23,816
{\fs20}and I ran it with the help
of my children: Wendy...

16
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:28,084
{\fs20}Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. And Mrs. Dixon.

17
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:30,414
{\fs20}Thank you.

18
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,618
{\fs20}And Skeeter.

19
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:37,190
{\fs20}May I help you with your
bags, Mr. And Mrs. Dixon?

20
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:39,734
{\fs20}- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.

21
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:45,630
{\fs20}You, uh, need a hand?

22
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,471
{\fs20}No, no. I got it.

23
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,872
{\fs20}OK.

24
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:55,447
{\fs20}To my boy Skeeter, the
motel was a wonderland.

25
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,178
{\fs20}Way too hyper.

26
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,812
{\fs20}The galaxy's not big
enough for the both of us.

27
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,378
{\fs20}A magical place.

28
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:07,929
{\fs20}Full of new adventures
for a six-year-old boy.

29
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:12,593
{\fs20}Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,001
{\fs20}Skeeter loved the old
place as much as I did.

31
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:22,510
{\fs20}And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better.

32
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:25,877
{\fs20}I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.

33
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:29,782
{\fs20}I was thinking we could put an
extra pair of socks in each room

34
00:02:29,852 --> 00:02:33,583
{\fs20}because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

35
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,080
{\fs20}That's a good idea.

36
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:38,558
{\fs20}Time for bed, I'm meeting
with Mr. Nottingham.

37
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:41,221
{\fs20}Wait, Dad. I'm not even tired.

38
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:44,697
{\fs20}Well, how about a bedtime story?

39
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,098
{\fs20}Yay!

40
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:53,771
{\fs20}Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

41
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:56,470
{\fs20}and that little boy's name was Skeeter.

42
00:02:56,545 --> 00:03:01,278
{\fs20}Well, I could tell a pretty fair
tale when the muse was with me.

43
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,648
{\fs20}And making my little boy smile,

44
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,153
{\fs20}now, that was truly magical.

45
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:11,158
{\fs20}Yeah, I was a pretty good
dad and a pretty good host.

46
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:15,595
{\fs20}But unfortunately, a
pretty bad businessman.

47
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:18,565
{\fs20}Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

48
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:21,102
{\fs20}This motel is sinking in red ink...

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,468
{\fs20}and I'm offering you the last lifeboat.

50
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,031
{\fs20}I don't know.

51
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:29,270
{\fs20}I've seen the books, Martin.

52
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:32,507
{\fs20}If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

53
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:34,378
{\fs20}Yes, well, I...

54
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,646
{\fs20}I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

55
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,380
{\fs20}How about this?

56
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:42,753
{\fs20}If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

57
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,816
{\fs20}I'll let him run this place.

58
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:47,525
{\fs20}You promise?

59
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:50,861
{\fs20}Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.

60
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,507
{\fs20}That's my boy, Bronson.

61
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:04,239
{\fs20}Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

62
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:08,249
{\fs20}It's going to be
uptight and out of sight.

63
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:13,118
{\fs20}And just like that, our modest
little Sunny Vista Motel...

64
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:17,955
{\fs20}... metamorphosized into the
mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.

65
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:20,460
{\fs20}And for the past 25 years,

66
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,930
{\fs20}it has been lovingly maintained
by my now grown-up son,

67
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,832
{\fs20}Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.

68
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:30,201
{\fs20}Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's
promise for Skeeter to run the place

69
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:32,797
{\fs20}- seems to have been forgotten...
- Hiya, Pop.

70
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,470
{\fs20}... my boy always works
diligently with a hopeful heart,

71
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:38,410
{\fs20}still waiting for his shot.

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,347
{\fs20}Mrs. Dixon? Is there a
problem with her room?

73
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,112
{\fs20}Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

74
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:47,781
{\fs20}Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

75
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:49,187
{\fs20}and doesn't want to pay for it.

76
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:52,250
{\fs20}I never even touched that
evil little refrigerator.

77
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,227
{\fs20}I don't drink alcohol.

78
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:56,230
{\fs20}Of course. There's probably a mix-up.

79
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,664
{\fs20}- I saw who took it.
- OK.

80
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:00,861
{\fs20}He had red hair and a beard.

81
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:03,427
{\fs20}He was wearing a green
suit with brass buttons.

82
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:05,939
{\fs20}And he stands about ten inches tall.

83
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:08,602
{\fs20}So we're talking about a leprechaun?

84
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:09,701
{\fs20}There you go.

85
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:12,246
{\fs20}Oh, I didn't know your
brother was in town.

86
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,544
{\fs20}So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

87
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:18,052
{\fs20}Put all the missing bottles on my tab.

88
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,850
{\fs20}Next time you see any
leprechauns, we'll tell Aspen.

89
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:21,981
{\fs20}She's half-troll.

90
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:24,525
{\fs20}I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

91
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,590
{\fs20}She would.

92
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:32,734
{\fs20}Today magic is in the
air at the grand hotel,

93
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,326
{\fs20}and the winds of change
are about to blow our story

94
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:37,702
{\fs20}in a strange new direction.

95
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:39,707
{\fs20}But what would you expect in a hotel

96
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,744
{\fs20}founded by someone who loved
a good story as much as I?

97
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,109
{\fs20}Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.

98
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,911
{\fs20}Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

99
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:50,315
{\fs20}Of course.

100
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:53,377
{\fs20}- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.

101
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:55,753
{\fs20}Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

102
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,816
{\fs20}Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

103
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:00,486
{\fs20}- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.

104
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:02,621
{\fs20}I say "Barry," you say "Nottingham."

105
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:04,427
{\fs20}- Barry.
- Nottingham.

106
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:06,057
{\fs20}- Barry.
- Nottingham.

107
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:08,261
{\fs20}Barry had a Nottingham

108
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:10,601
{\fs20}Nottingham, Nottingham

109
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,401
{\fs20}Barry had a Nottingham

110
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:15,136
{\fs20}Whose beard was white as snow

111
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,077
{\fs20}Come on, give it up for the big man.

112
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:21,072
{\fs20}Got them warmed up for you, sir.

113
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,515
{\fs20}- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.

114
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:24,609
{\fs20}- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,

115
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:26,813
{\fs20}Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...

116
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,253
{\fs20}Not a fear, an awareness...

117
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,917
{\fs20}...of germs and how
dangerous they can be

118
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:34,326
{\fs20}when not properly... feared, so...

119
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:36,796
{\fs20}You're doing the right
thing. I didn't shower today.

120
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,628
{\fs20}So, yeah, let me get out of here.

121
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,362
{\fs20}Barry Nottingham, everybody.

122
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:46,972
{\fs20}- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- Welcome.

123
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:52,002
{\fs20}As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

124
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,139
{\fs20}But it's no secret that this one,

125
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:57,413
{\fs20}the Sunny Vista
Nottingham, is my favorite.

126
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,420
{\fs20}However, this is a 20th-century hotel.

127
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:07,690
{\fs20}We need something for the 21 st century.

128
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:11,164
{\fs20}And so, we have decided
to close this hotel

129
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:16,261
{\fs20}and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

130
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,408
{\fs20}This will be the largest
hotel on the West Coast.

131
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:26,072
{\fs20}I simply don't understand what the
fuss is about. It's just a big building.

132
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,912
{\fs20}Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

133
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:32,647
{\fs20}...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

134
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,252
{\fs20}Yes!

135
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:41,227
{\fs20}So I'm proud to announce the
new hotel's general manager.

136
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:44,356
{\fs20}He's been waiting on
this for a long time.

137
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:48,563
{\fs20}We all know how hard he
works, how intelligent he is,

138
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,071
{\fs20}how much this hotel means to him.

139
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,233
{\fs20}Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!

140
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:56,576
{\fs20}Take a bow, Kendall.

141
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,874
{\fs20}- God bless.
- Boo!

142
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,112
{\fs20}A beautiful speech,
sir. A beautiful speech.

143
00:08:04,186 --> 00:08:06,177
{\fs20}I'm so glad you could come.

144
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:08,051
{\fs20}It's great to see you.

145
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:09,556
{\fs20}Don't touch me.

146
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:10,955
{\fs20}Well done, Daddy.

147
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:16,263
{\fs20}Oh, oh, hello there. Do you
know my daughter, Violet?

148
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:18,265
{\fs20}Only by reputation, sir.

149
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,028
{\fs20}Excuse me?

150
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:22,900
{\fs20}No, no, not that she has a reputation.

151
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,438
{\fs20}I always heard she's very hot.

152
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:27,070
{\fs20}Not hot as in hot.

153
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:29,110
{\fs20}Hot, I meant warm... Warm-hearted.

154
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:33,079
{\fs20}And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,

155
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:36,379
{\fs20}in bars, with a lot of
different guys, and...

156
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:39,420
{\fs20}That's the old Violet
Nottingham. Before she met me.

157
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:42,218
{\fs20}Now it's up to me to keep my
pooky-bear out of the spotlight

158
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,885
{\fs20}and nightclubs and tabloids.
Isn't that right, sir?

159
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,896
{\fs20}Violet's off to her private
tennis lesson with Roger Federer.

160
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:51,626
{\fs20}- Oh. All right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.

161
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,362
{\fs20}Got to say, uh...

162
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:57,997
{\fs20}...it's gonna be hard for me to see
the hotel move locations like this.

163
00:08:58,073 --> 00:09:01,509
{\fs20}Well, I, I do hope you'll feel
able to come and work with us there.

164
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:03,601
{\fs20}Big as Kendall wants to make it,

165
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:06,442
{\fs20}well, there's going to be a
lot of light bulbs to change.

166
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:09,910
{\fs20}Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?

167
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:12,476
{\fs20}There is, sir. Come this
way. I'll get you some.

168
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:14,317
{\fs20}Can't be too careful, Kendall.

169
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:26,198
{\fs20}All right, everyone finished
at the pottery table,

170
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:27,792
{\fs20}bring their art to the kiln.

171
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,463
{\fs20}The man with the rescue
donkey's leaving in five minutes,

172
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,268
{\fs20}if you haven't gotten a ride, hurry up.

173
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,568
{\fs20}Thank you, Principal Duva.

174
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:36,110
{\fs20}Oh, I'm not a principal
at this party. I'm a mom.

175
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:38,707
{\fs20}Hey!

176
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,045
{\fs20}I notice no one's eating the
gluten-free wheatgrass cake.

177
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:45,575
{\fs20}Come on. Trust me, you just
got to get past the smell.

178
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,890
{\fs20}What? The clown died?

179
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,656
{\fs20}- What's in that bag?
- Oh, chocolate chip cookie.

180
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,857
{\fs20}- Food!
- Food!

181
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,800
{\fs20}- Slow it down, slow it down.
- Hey, sissy.

182
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:04,930
{\fs20}Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled
crud to my house every time you visit?

183
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:08,032
{\fs20}What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.

184
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,543
{\fs20}What are you talking about?
It hasn't been four years.

185
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:12,705
{\fs20}You were here for The
Fourth of July barbecue

186
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,078
{\fs20}when you punched my husband?

187
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,913
{\fs20}Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,

188
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:18,714
{\fs20}but his underwear had holes in it.

189
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:21,585
{\fs20}I knew he'd be your
ex-husband. You should be happy.

190
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,021
{\fs20}All right. Let's not start.

191
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:24,683
{\fs20}How are the kids handling

192
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,192
{\fs20}the old divorce anyways?

193
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:29,321
{\fs20}They're both kind of off right
now. Bobbi's been really quiet.

194
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:31,888
{\fs20}Why don't you go say hi.
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy.

195
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,527
{\fs20}- Is that what stinks in here?
- No, it's the cake.

196
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,366
{\fs20}What did she make, donkey cake?

197
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:39,532
{\fs20}I smell manure.

198
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:42,304
{\fs20}Hey, you guys. Remember me?

199
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:44,776
{\fs20}Uncle Skeeter.

200
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:48,282
{\fs20}Man, you got big. Haven't
seen you in a while.

201
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,012
{\fs20}Happy birthday there, Bobbi.

202
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:53,554
{\fs20}I'm Patrick. She's Bobbi.

203
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:55,283
{\fs20}Oh, my bad.

204
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:58,451
{\fs20}Got you a little something.
Happy birthday, Bobbi.

205
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:01,086
{\fs20}Here you go. Picked it up at the hotel.

206
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,289
{\fs20}How's school going?

207
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:05,697
{\fs20}- Skeeter?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:08,292
{\fs20}Getting called to the
principal's office. Look at that.

209
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,429
{\fs20}Have fun with the gifts. And...

210
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:12,863
{\fs20}Yes, yes.

211
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,202
{\fs20}Shampoo?

212
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,001
{\fs20}And a soap?

213
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,078
{\fs20}Hanger and a towel.

214
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,174
{\fs20}Do not talk about school with them.

215
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:25,549
{\fs20}What's going on with the school?

216
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,645
{\fs20}- They're closing it down.
- No.

217
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:30,350
{\fs20}- I'm getting laid off.
- You?

218
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:32,893
{\fs20}You're like the classic
school principal.

219
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,589
{\fs20}I mean, you're, you're
scary and bad with people.

220
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:37,256
{\fs20}Children are nervous around you.

221
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:40,733
{\fs20}That doesn't sound right, but, I'm
just saying, what else could you do?

222
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:44,602
{\fs20}Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the
bogeyman. You could be the bogeyman.

223
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:46,334
{\fs20}- Anyway...
- What, what?

224
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,433
{\fs20}I've got some interviews
set up in Arizona,

225
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,035
{\fs20}which is kind of what I
wanted to talk to you about.

226
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:52,579
{\fs20}Uh-oh.

227
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,241
{\fs20}I need you to watch
the kids... for a week.

228
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:58,252
{\fs20}No! No, they don't even like me!

229
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,151
{\fs20}It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter.

230
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,121
{\fs20}My friend Jill is a
teacher at my school.

231
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,421
{\fs20}She'll bring the kids in with her
and watch them till dinnertime.

232
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,120
{\fs20}All you gotta do is the night shift.

233
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:08,856
{\fs20}Why can't your stupid friend do that?

234
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,660
{\fs20}She's got night school. Skeeter!

235
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,224
{\fs20}My husband left me.
I'm getting laid off.

236
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:17,362
{\fs20}I, I have to move. I need your help.

237
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:20,033
{\fs20}So you need me. This is good.

238
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,405
{\fs20}I'll do it.

239
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:23,171
{\fs20}But you got to say,

240
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,212
{\fs20}"Skeeter is the coolest. I am a nerd."

241
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,145
{\fs20}"Skeeter's the coolest. I'm a nerd?"

242
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:30,378
{\fs20}Yeah, you are! Whoo!

243
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:31,749
{\fs20}OK. Hey, you guys.

244
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,084
{\fs20}I'm going to hang out with
you this week. All right?

245
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:35,952
{\fs20}Maybe we can go... fishing.

246
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:38,891
{\fs20}I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.

247
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,291
{\fs20}OK, we'll stay inside.

248
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:42,387
{\fs20}How about, uh, we play some poker?

249
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:45,627
{\fs20}- I can teach you that.
- Gambling? I don't think so.

250
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,225
{\fs20}OK, how about we just
take walks in the park

251
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:51,397
{\fs20}- and catalog plant species?
- Now you're talking.

252
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:53,134
{\fs20}I don't know anything about plants

253
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,142
{\fs20}except you try to
make cakes out of them!

254
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,337
{\fs20}He liked that one. I'm
gonna end with a laugh.

255
00:12:57,412 --> 00:13:00,575
{\fs20}Give me some. Huh?

256
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:03,549
{\fs20}I wasn't gonna hit you. I was
trying to do the fist thing.

257
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:05,347
{\fs20}You don't know the fist thing?

258
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,887
{\fs20}OK, I was just...

259
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,347
{\fs20}That's what, uh, the children do.

260
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,424
{\fs20}Hey, yeh, yeh.

261
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,231
{\fs20}Oh, this your truck, chief?

262
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:18,993
{\fs20}Yes, it is, ma'am.

263
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,558
{\fs20}You realize you're taking
up two parking spaces?

264
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,331
{\fs20}It's a big truck, ma'am.

265
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:26,101
{\fs20}It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.

266
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:28,199
{\fs20}I had to park all the
way down the block.

267
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:31,109
{\fs20}Well, next time park in that
box. Plenty of room in there.

268
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:35,275
{\fs20}Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,

269
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,443
{\fs20}this is the hotel I work for's truck.

270
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,579
{\fs20}So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.

271
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:43,522
{\fs20}So two parking spaces
provides me with what I call

272
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:47,027
{\fs20}"a cushion of protection."

273
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:50,087
{\fs20}Wait, a hotel? Oh, wait.
You're Wendy's brother.

274
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:52,133
{\fs20}- Yeah.
- I'm Jill.

275
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,532
{\fs20}- Who's that?
- I'm her friend,

276
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:57,400
{\fs20}the one helping take care of
the kids. I'm the day shift.

277
00:13:57,472 --> 00:14:02,205
{\fs20}OK, June. You plan on being
this hostile the whole time?

278
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:04,074
{\fs20}Jill. My name is Jill.

279
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,739
{\fs20}Do you plan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?

280
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:10,512
{\fs20}Oh, haven't you heard?
Goofy's the new handsome.

281
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,786
{\fs20}- That sounds good for the environment.
- Oh, we can't all have Priuses.

282
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,260
{\fs20}How do you know I drive a Prius?

283
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,264
{\fs20}Your whole aura reads Prius.

284
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:29,426
{\fs20}Anyways, you're in my cushion
of protection right now.

285
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:32,530
{\fs20}I want to back up, so if you
could just zing-zang up there,

286
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:35,474
{\fs20}- that would be helpful.
- Yeah.

287
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,738
{\fs20}You might want some
Cinnabons. You'll need it.

288
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:40,906
{\fs20}Food!

289
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:45,282
{\fs20}Give it back! Somebody
owes me six bucks!

290
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:50,052
{\fs20}So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hotel?

291
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,421
{\fs20}He promised your dad.

292
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,859
{\fs20}I wanted to. It just
wasn't the right time.

293
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,293
{\fs20}Let me tell you how it works.

294
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:57,126
{\fs20}The big man's giving the job to Kendall

295
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:58,756
{\fs20}because he's dating his daughter.

296
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,994
{\fs20}That's the way it works,
keep it in the family.

297
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:03,833
{\fs20}He gets the girl, he gets
the job, he gets everything.

298
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,167
{\fs20}And I get nothing.

299
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:13,607
{\fs20}- Hello?
- Where are you? Still there?

300
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:15,342
{\fs20}I'm still where? Who's this?

301
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,442
{\fs20}Look, I've got to get to class.
The kids are waiting for you, OK?

302
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,613
{\fs20}Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

303
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:23,452
{\fs20}I forgot. I'll be there
in like 20 minutes.

304
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,752
{\fs20}I'm gonna baby-sit my
nephew and niece tonight.

305
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:31,458
{\fs20}Oh, God. Got any advice for me?

306
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,127
{\fs20}Yes, I do. Sometimes I
baby-sit my cousins, right?

307
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:36,432
{\fs20}And what I do is I
let them style me hair.

308
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:39,735
{\fs20}Like put beads into it and braid
it, make me look all real sexy.

309
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:43,004
{\fs20}Like Milli Vanilli, stuff
like that. You should try that.

310
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:45,978
{\fs20}Braid my hair? That's a good
idea. Can I have some French fries?

311
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:48,675
{\fs20}Of course you can.
You're my best friend.

312
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:53,045
{\fs20}Ah! Actually, I really
like ketchup on my face

313
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,055
{\fs20}because it's rejuvenating for the skin.

314
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,614
{\fs20}So who's the real victim? You are.

315
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:00,354
{\fs20}Mmm! Delicious.

316
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:06,329
{\fs20}Do you think these signs will help?

317
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:08,801
{\fs20}Well, miracles happen, you know?

318
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,031
{\fs20}You mean like Dad coming back?

319
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:12,436
{\fs20}Um...

320
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:19,539
{\fs20}Hey! Sorry I'm late.

321
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:21,548
{\fs20}So, um, their pajamas are on their beds,

322
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:25,177
{\fs20}and I will be back, um, at
8:30 to pick them up, OK?

323
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:28,017
{\fs20}- All right.
- Here is my cell phone number.

324
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,614
{\fs20}And call me if there's any emergencies.

325
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:33,490
{\fs20}All right. Have fun at night school.

326
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,586
{\fs20}- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

327
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,824
{\fs20}All packed up here.

328
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,266
{\fs20}I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.

329
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,737
{\fs20}Some clean underwear.

330
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,908
{\fs20}Well, maybe not that clean.

331
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,402
{\fs20}You guys want to watch TV?

332
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,379
{\fs20}We don't have a TV.

333
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,707
{\fs20}- Hello?
- Emergency!

334
00:16:58,586 --> 00:16:59,985
{\fs20}They don't have a TV.

335
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:02,488
{\fs20}Wendy doesn't let them
watch TV. You didn't know?

336
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,548
{\fs20}I don't know a lot of
things about these kids.

337
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:07,322
{\fs20}I wasn't allowed over here.
Their old man didn't like me.

338
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:10,489
{\fs20}OK, listen, you don't need a TV. You
can, um, play a game, do a puzzle.

339
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,829
{\fs20}I'm sure you can figure
something out. OK?

340
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,733
{\fs20}Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let
them braid my hair or something?

341
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:17,361
{\fs20}Would they like that?

342
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:19,702
{\fs20}I don't think anyone
should touch that hair.

343
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:26,941
{\fs20}Hey, what do you say we go...

344
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:30,451
{\fs20}next door and toilet paper
your neighbor's trees?

345
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,419
{\fs20}No? OK, bedtime!

346
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,199
{\fs20}OK, so you guys cool?

347
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,759
{\fs20}You have to read us a bedtime story.

348
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:52,203
{\fs20}Yeah, all right. You have any?

349
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:58,002
{\fs20}Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?

350
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,139
{\fs20}"Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"?

351
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:03,376
{\fs20}Mmm, no.

352
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:06,818
{\fs20}"The Organic Squirrel
Gets a Bike Helmet"?

353
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:09,413
{\fs20}I'm not reading these
communist books to you guys.

354
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,014
{\fs20}Don't you got any real stories?

355
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:13,390
{\fs20}- Like what?
- Like what?

356
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:15,895
{\fs20}Like, like cowboys? Or dragons?

357
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:19,194
{\fs20}Or aliens? Or... What the
heck is on my head right now?

358
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,395
{\fs20}That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.

359
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,405
{\fs20}- Why do you call him Bugsy?
- Because of his eyes.

360
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,202
{\fs20}Let me see them.

361
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:34,076
{\fs20}Wow! Those eyes would be big on a cow.

362
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,382
{\fs20}Are those eyeballs or bowling balls?

363
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,421
{\fs20}Can't keep my eyes off of them.

364
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:44,083
{\fs20}Just get in there so I don't have
to look at them anymore. Goodbye.

365
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:45,785
{\fs20}Anyways, uh,

366
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,624
{\fs20}you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?

367
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:50,630
{\fs20}Like, like my old man used to do for me?

368
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:52,222
{\fs20}Maybe I could be good at this.

369
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:56,730
{\fs20}All right, um...

370
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:57,998
{\fs20}Here goes.

371
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:03,271
{\fs20}Once upon a time, in a
magical, faraway kingdom...

372
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:08,045
{\fs20}... there was a brave and noble knight.

373
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:11,051
{\fs20}Strikingly handsome.

374
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,916
{\fs20}Who lived in a grand castle

375
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:18,516
{\fs20}that weary travelers from near
and far would come and visit.

376
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:22,586
{\fs20}Now, this knight had been
working his butt off for years.

377
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:25,461
{\fs20}You'd think he'd be a shoo-in
to rule the castle, right?

378
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,626
{\fs20}- Right.
- Wrong.

379
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:32,696
{\fs20}Actually, he wasn't
even a knight at all.

380
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:35,973
{\fs20}Oh, no.

381
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:41,306
{\fs20}He was, in fact, just a lowly peasant.

382
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:44,613
{\fs20}And even though he was the son
of the late, great Lord Marty...

383
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,380
{\fs20}Thank you.

384
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:50,515
{\fs20}... and knew everything there is
to know about running a castle,

385
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:53,560
{\fs20}everyone just took him for granted.

386
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:57,655
{\fs20}His name was Mr. Underappreciated.

387
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,666
{\fs20}What's "underdemeciated"?

388
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:02,498
{\fs20}- Under de-what?
- Underdemeciated.

389
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,800
{\fs20}That's right, I forgot you were six.

390
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:08,171
{\fs20}His name was
Sir... Fix-A-Lot.

391
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:11,211
{\fs20}But alas, the kingdom
where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived

392
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,443
{\fs20}did not place much value on
dedication or hard work, I guess.

393
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:21,045
{\fs20}Because the superstar in all
the land was Sir Butt-Kiss.

394
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:24,990
{\fs20}And he spent all his days
kissing everybody's butt.

395
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,691
{\fs20}Boo!

396
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:31,254
{\fs20}And my lord, yes, of
course I can get you

397
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:34,529
{\fs20}front row house seats to The Lion King.

398
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:37,435
{\fs20}And Sir Fix-A-Lot had a
best friend, Friar Fred,

399
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,439
{\fs20}who was not right in the head.

400
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:43,876
{\fs20}She never! No! Not our
queen, I won't have that.

401
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:47,676
{\fs20}- Were there any kids in the kingdom?
- Yes, yes. Of course.

402
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,715
{\fs20}There were two young pages.

403
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:54,346
{\fs20}Mistress Stinky and Master Smelly.

404
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:57,289
{\fs20}Hey-oh! And don't forget...

405
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:59,792
{\fs20}Jillian! The queen of the fairies!

406
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,590
{\fs20}Queen of the fairies?

407
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:04,961
{\fs20}I mean, if she has to be there,
let's just make her an angry raven.

408
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:10,670
{\fs20}Parking spot!

409
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:13,002
{\fs20}She should be a mermaid teacher.

410
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:15,634
{\fs20}Yeah. The best mermaid
teacher in the world.

411
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,338
{\fs20}Children, open your books to page 16.

412
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:19,845
{\fs20}Yes, Miss Mermaid.

413
00:21:19,914 --> 00:21:21,176
{\fs20}Let's begin.

414
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:23,513
{\fs20}All right, she's a
mermaid. Whatever you want.

415
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,051
{\fs20}Anyways, back to the story.

416
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,283
{\fs20}One day the king invited all
his subjects to the castle.

417
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:31,188
{\fs20}I bring glad tidings.

418
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,819
{\fs20}For on this day I have chosen a champion

419
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:35,954
{\fs20}who will run this castle

420
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,433
{\fs20}and be my closest
advisor and bestest buddy.

421
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,231
{\fs20}My new champion is...

422
00:21:43,304 --> 00:21:44,669
{\fs20}...Sir Butt-Kiss!

423
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,214
{\fs20}Thank you.

424
00:21:56,284 --> 00:22:00,618
{\fs20}Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot
had been passed over.

425
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:04,988
{\fs20}So, Sir Fix-A-Lot
moved into a giant shoe,

426
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:08,586
{\fs20}got a bad case of athlete's face,

427
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:09,857
{\fs20}dove into a moat...

428
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:11,899
{\fs20}Ah, what the heck.

429
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,695
{\fs20}... and got eaten by crocodiles.

430
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:17,036
{\fs20}The end.

431
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:20,369
{\fs20}The end? That can't be the end.

432
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:22,705
{\fs20}- Why? Why not?
- It's not happy.

433
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:26,304
{\fs20}There aren't happy endings in real
life. Sooner you know that, the better.

434
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,110
{\fs20}- It's not fair!
- What? What's not fair?

435
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:33,244
{\fs20}I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at least get a shot to be champion?

436
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:36,722
{\fs20}- A shot? Hmm...
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better

437
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,760
{\fs20}than Sir Butt-Kiss, he should
get a chance to prove it.

438
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:42,261
{\fs20}OK. Yeah, yeah, Bobbi, good.

439
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,127
{\fs20}What the king really said was...

440
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:46,632
{\fs20}On second thought,

441
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:49,761
{\fs20}there is another worthy
man in my kingdom,

442
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:53,329
{\fs20}and it wouldn't be fair
unless he got a shot, too.

443
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:56,308
{\fs20}Sir
Fix-A-Lot!

444
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,436
{\fs20}And then the crowd went nuts.

445
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:05,342
{\fs20}But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot
is as common as muck.

446
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,613
{\fs20}Boo!

447
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:09,656
{\fs20}And Friar Fred drop-kicked
a booing goblin.

448
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:12,591
{\fs20}Boo!

449
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,721
{\fs20}And the mermaid teacher did one
of those weird tail dolphin moves.

450
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:22,027
{\fs20}And Stinky and Smelly did
the fastest Irish jig ever.

451
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:25,163
{\fs20}Whoo-hoo-hoo!

452
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,867
{\fs20}Yeah. Right on.

453
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:31,207
{\fs20}Prince Bugsy busted
out some fancy moves.

454
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,213
{\fs20}And then... and then...

455
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,272
{\fs20}It started raining gumballs.

456
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:41,516
{\fs20}Raining gumballs?

457
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:44,717
{\fs20}Why not? It's a bedtime
story. Anything can happen.

458
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,818
{\fs20}Yeah, yeah. I guess in a story.

459
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:51,194
{\fs20}I just wish it was like that
in real life. I really do.

460
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:55,558
{\fs20}- What was that?
- Bugsy.

461
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,627
{\fs20}Oh.

462
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,366
{\fs20}He rings that bell when he's hungry?

463
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,739
{\fs20}No, when he needs to go to sleep.

464
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,941
{\fs20}OK. As you wish, Your Highness.

465
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:19,853
{\fs20}All right, you guys, have a good
sleep. You, too, uh, weird eyes.

466
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:30,231
{\fs20}Well, I don't have much to work with,

467
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,431
{\fs20}but I will make us

468
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:35,703
{\fs20}a delicious breakfast

469
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:38,370
{\fs20}that I know you will enjoy.

470
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:41,472
{\fs20}Yes, some banana on the rice cake,

471
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,109
{\fs20}and then what do we
call this? Wheat germ.

472
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,881
{\fs20}I was told germs are bad
for you, but here goes.

473
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:50,120
{\fs20}I like it.

474
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:52,785
{\fs20}A rice cake-banana-wheat
germ sandwich.

475
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,384
{\fs20}And what do we got?

476
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,626
{\fs20}This is terrible.

477
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:04,102
{\fs20}Doesn't your, your
mother have taste buds?

478
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,935
{\fs20}What are we doing here? We got
nothing to use in this house.

479
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,599
{\fs20}Hang on.

480
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,040
{\fs20}A little flavor.

481
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:17,076
{\fs20}It's good because, now we
don't have to brush our teeth.

482
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:22,744
{\fs20}There you go. At least we got a
little mint going on. Guys want one?

483
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:25,826
{\fs20}Hang on.

484
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:31,229
{\fs20}Hello!

485
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:33,926
{\fs20}Bronson? The television
set in Mr. Nottingham's room

486
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:36,128
{\fs20}is broken and it needs
to be fixed right away.

487
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,297
{\fs20}I have a situation here. I'm
watching my nephew and my niece.

488
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,807
{\fs20}I'm sorry. Are you having
difficulty hearing me?

489
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:44,401
{\fs20}Mr. Nottingham wants
to watch television now!

490
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,912
{\fs20}I hear you. I speak
trollinese, don't worry.

491
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:49,916
{\fs20}There's a leprechaun behind you.

492
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:51,713
{\fs20}Gotcha.

493
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:57,153
{\fs20}Thanks a lot, gentlemen. OK.

494
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:58,589
{\fs20}- Wow.
- It's pretty, huh?

495
00:25:58,659 --> 00:25:59,648
{\fs20}Whoa!

496
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:03,686
{\fs20}I got to go fix my boss' television set,
but I need somebody to watch you two.

497
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:06,494
{\fs20}Violet! Right here. Give a smile.

498
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:07,932
{\fs20}Hang on.

499
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:11,631
{\fs20}Violet! Skeeter Bronson, the
handyman from the other day.

500
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:13,434
{\fs20}Oh, right. Yes.

501
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:15,805
{\fs20}Listen, uh, I got some
kids with me right now.

502
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:18,367
{\fs20}My nephew and niece. But, I
gotta fix your father's TV.

503
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:20,106
{\fs20}Could you watch them a few minutes?

504
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:21,546
{\fs20}Huh?

505
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,348
{\fs20}Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going.

506
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,217
{\fs20}Come in.

507
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:33,684
{\fs20}- Mr. Nottingham, sir?
- Uh, the telly won't turn on.

508
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:37,322
{\fs20}It won't? Well, let me just
take a... tallyho at it, OK?

509
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:39,161
{\fs20}I'll just flip this light on.

510
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:42,828
{\fs20}No, no, no, no! Absolutely not!

511
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,370
{\fs20}I'm fighting a cold here.

512
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,770
{\fs20}I must stay in the
dark whenever possible.

513
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,330
{\fs20}Do you realize

514
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:52,311
{\fs20}germs can reproduce 80
percent faster in bright light?

515
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:55,212
{\fs20}Oh, OK. Here we go, nice and dark again.

516
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,648
{\fs20}- The germs are confused.
- Come towards me.

517
00:26:57,718 --> 00:27:00,516
{\fs20}OK. It's got to be
around here somewhere.

518
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,388
{\fs20}For heaven's sake.

519
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,892
{\fs20}I'm so sorry, sir. I
just can't see a thing.

520
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:09,156
{\fs20}- To your left, there.
- Oh!

521
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,722
{\fs20}There's the TV. So how's the,
uh, new hotel coming, sir?

522
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,827
{\fs20}Oh, very well. Still dealing with the
city on building permits and whatnot.

523
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:18,371
{\fs20}Uh-huh.

524
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,168
{\fs20}I can't tell you the secret theme.

525
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,607
{\fs20}It's so good, we don't
want anyone to steal it.

526
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,611
{\fs20}- I hear you, sir.
- OK, I'll tell you.

527
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,704
{\fs20}Come along, sit down. Please.

528
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,112
{\fs20}Great.

529
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:31,747
{\fs20}Ready?

530
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,645
{\fs20}Rock and roll.

531
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:38,715
{\fs20}Vintage vinyl. Music
memorabilia in the lobby.

532
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:42,023
{\fs20}Oh, OK. Like, uh, like the Hard Rock?

533
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,860
{\fs20}- The What What?
- The Hard Rock Hotel.

534
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:47,924
{\fs20}They've been using that
theme for, like, years.

535
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:53,937
{\fs20}Get Kendall Duncan up
here straightaway, please.

536
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:56,238
{\fs20}What a perfect little powder puff.

537
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:01,238
{\fs20}Thank you.

538
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:04,807
{\fs20}So, Patrick, truth or dare?

539
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:07,115
{\fs20}Truth?

540
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:10,315
{\fs20}How old were you the first
time you kissed a girl?

541
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:12,450
{\fs20}Patrick never kissed a girl.

542
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:14,494
{\fs20}Girls are bis-crusting.

543
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:18,229
{\fs20}Except for Trisha Sparks.

544
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,132
{\fs20}Ooh, is that a girl in your
class, you little Romeo?

545
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,327
{\fs20}Hey, guys.

546
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:24,769
{\fs20}Hi, Aunt Jill, did you
get the note we left you?

547
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,669
{\fs20}Yes, I did.

548
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,641
{\fs20}And, uh, now we have to get you
guys ready for school. So, come on.

549
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,678
{\fs20}- Hi.
- Hi.

550
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:34,814
{\fs20}Oh, hey. You're, uh...

551
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:39,342
{\fs20}- Uh-huh. Here's your fat mouse.
- It's a guinea pig, but...

552
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,548
{\fs20}And you, young man...

553
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:47,390
{\fs20}I want to hear all about this little
Trisha Sparks next time I see you.

554
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:52,789
{\fs20}Trisha Sparks is two
years older than you.

555
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:55,232
{\fs20}She's hot.

556
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:02,368
{\fs20}I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall.
We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.

557
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:07,710
{\fs20}This rock and roll idea
of yours is old hat.

558
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:12,343
{\fs20}Well, sir, I had every intention
of putting our own spin on it.

559
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,716
{\fs20}Do you know what, Skeeter?

560
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:16,415
{\fs20}I'm starting to get a fuzzy recollection

561
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,617
{\fs20}of something I said to your father.

562
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:22,560
{\fs20}In fact, I am going to give you a shot.

563
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:27,801
{\fs20}If you can come up with a
better theme than Kendall does,

564
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:30,063
{\fs20}I'll let you run the new place instead.

565
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:32,401
{\fs20}Oh, sir.

566
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:35,408
{\fs20}Don't you think this is perhaps
a little too much of a cruel joke

567
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:38,639
{\fs20}to be playing on somebody as...
well, the, the maintenance guy?

568
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:40,976
{\fs20}- No, I don't.
- No.

569
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:45,883
{\fs20}Mr. Bronson has been working
for this company for 25 years.

570
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:50,356
{\fs20}I'm beginning to think I may have
seriously underdemeciated him.

571
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,722
{\fs20}I'm sorry. "Underdemeciated"?

572
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:58,197
{\fs20}Precisely. You can both present your
ideas at my birthday party this weekend.

573
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:00,733
{\fs20}Thank you, Kendall. That is all.

574
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:03,235
{\fs20}Mr. Bronson, the
television, if you would.

575
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:06,238
{\fs20}Oh, and do watch out
for the germ vaporizer.

576
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,339
{\fs20}The best day of my life!

577
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:13,676
{\fs20}Amadeus Amadeus

578
00:30:13,747 --> 00:30:16,716
{\fs20}Amadeus Ow! Amadeus Yeah, yeah, yeah!

579
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:19,753
{\fs20}Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus

580
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,220
{\fs20}Ooh, rock me Amadeus

581
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:25,053
{\fs20}Amadeus Amadeus

582
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,125
{\fs20}Whoa. I like your car, pal.

583
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:31,130
{\fs20}Hey, thanks, champ.
You know what they say.

584
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,530
{\fs20}You want to be the best,
you got to drive the best.

585
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,363
{\fs20}Hey, uh, not to get personal,

586
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:38,098
{\fs20}but what's a sweet ride
like that cost, anyways?

587
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,868
{\fs20}You know what? Actually
it's surprisingly affordable.

588
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:41,930
{\fs20}Yeah?

589
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,137
{\fs20}If you saved every paycheck you
earn for the rest of your life

590
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:48,545
{\fs20}and then multiply it by ten, you
could probably buy my muffler.

591
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:52,717
{\fs20}Ah-ooga!

592
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:55,152
{\fs20}Oh, you wanna drag race, do you?

593
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:01,656
{\fs20}You win! Good job.

594
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,979
{\fs20}What?

595
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,737
{\fs20}This is spooky.

596
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:05,256
{\fs20}You've got to be kidding me! Look
at this. I'm losing all my candy.

597
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:09,284
{\fs20}How can you not see a
50-foot trailer? Come on.

598
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:17,235
{\fs20}So you have to compete for your job with
Skeeter Bronson. You'll annihilate him.

599
00:32:17,304 --> 00:32:20,296
{\fs20}Oh, I know. It's just a
little degrading, that's all.

600
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:25,342
{\fs20}Thanks for being there.

601
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:29,712
{\fs20}I'll be there as long as
there's a there to be at.

602
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:34,684
{\fs20}Oh, hello, children.

603
00:32:34,755 --> 00:32:36,814
{\fs20}We're looking for Skeeter Bronson.

604
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,085
{\fs20}Oh, Mr. Bronson.

605
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:41,354
{\fs20}Yes, you'll find him in room 109.

606
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:43,521
{\fs20}- OK.
- Please, this way.

607
00:32:53,574 --> 00:32:56,372
{\fs20}- Oh, my God! Did you see that thing?
- Those eyes.

608
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:59,378
{\fs20}They were, they were staring
into my, my very soul.

609
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:02,848
{\fs20}- Hey, Uncle Skeeter!
- Hey!

610
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:06,374
{\fs20}- Just who I wanted to see.
- Hey, chief, here's Bugsy.

611
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:08,080
{\fs20}- Got him.
- Why do they have to stay here?

612
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,123
{\fs20}Because I'm on call tonight, Jennifer.

613
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,454
{\fs20}It's Jill, actually, Scooter.

614
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:13,857
{\fs20}It is? OK, yeah...

615
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:17,761
{\fs20}You did not just do that.

616
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,560
{\fs20}I did. Watch. I'm gonna do it again.

617
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:24,466
{\fs20}So, guys, anything weird
happen to you today?

618
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:27,735
{\fs20}I had a substitute
teacher with an eye patch.

619
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,834
{\fs20}Uh... that's a little weird.
I'm talking like big-time weird.

620
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:33,345
{\fs20}Maybe coincidence weird, uh...

621
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:36,314
{\fs20}...as in gumball weird?

622
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,214
{\fs20}We're not allowed to chew gum.

623
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:41,652
{\fs20}Of course you're not. You
guys want to go to sleep?

624
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,246
{\fs20}It's only 5:30.

625
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:44,756
{\fs20}And we haven't had dinner.

626
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:47,794
{\fs20}Hmm. OK.

627
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,123
{\fs20}Room service!

628
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:53,064
{\fs20}So you've never been skateboarding?

629
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,657
{\fs20}You've never played video games?

630
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:56,930
{\fs20}Mom says they rot your brain.

631
00:33:57,004 --> 00:34:01,373
{\fs20}That's not true. I've been playing video
games my whole life, and look at me.

632
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:06,168
{\fs20}Yeah, maybe she's got a point.

633
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:08,806
{\fs20}You. You've never eaten bacon?

634
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,782
{\fs20}What's bacon?

635
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:13,820
{\fs20}Bacon is the juicy,
fatty part of the pig

636
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:16,082
{\fs20}right adjacent to the rear.

637
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:21,025
{\fs20}But delicious and tasty,
not how I just made it sound.

638
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:24,757
{\fs20}And this is the first
hamburger you've ever eaten?

639
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:28,028
{\fs20}- What's the verdict? What do you think?
- Life-changing.

640
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,467
{\fs20}- Mom's gonna kill us.
- No, she isn't.

641
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:33,005
{\fs20}First of all, she's never
gonna find out about this.

642
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:36,270
{\fs20}And second of all, she used
to eat plenty of hamburgers

643
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:38,436
{\fs20}when we were growing
up in this very room.

644
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:40,844
{\fs20}She did?

645
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,077
{\fs20}Looks like Bugsy's eaten a lot of
burgers in the last ten minutes.

646
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:47,042
{\fs20}Wow!

647
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,953
{\fs20}He keeps going like that, we
could make bacon out of Bugsy.

648
00:34:51,525 --> 00:34:53,891
{\fs20}He's kidding, Bugsy. Take it easy.

649
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,157
{\fs20}OK. Let's get you carnivores to bed.

650
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,221
{\fs20}I got a, a new story
I want to lay on you.

651
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,164
{\fs20}What do you think of
cowboys and Indians?

652
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:03,964
{\fs20}Oh, yes, tonight's the night!

653
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:06,733
{\fs20}I just like cowboys and
Indians 'cause of the conflict.

654
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:10,274
{\fs20}OK, once upon a time in the Old West,

655
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:12,834
{\fs20}before room service was even invented...

656
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:16,371
{\fs20}... there was a farm hand
named Jeremiah Skeets.

657
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,509
{\fs20}He was looking to get
ahead in the world,

658
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:19,847
{\fs20}but was having a problem

659
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,013
{\fs20}with his current mode of transportation.

660
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:28,791
{\fs20}Uh, that was my horse.
That wasn't me, everybody.

661
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:32,461
{\fs20}Someone once told Jeremiah

662
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:34,727
{\fs20}that if he wanted to be the best,

663
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,292
{\fs20}he'd have to ride the best.

664
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,395
{\fs20}You mind showing me your finest horse?

665
00:35:43,677 --> 00:35:47,773
{\fs20}My ancestors believe horse spirit

666
00:35:47,848 --> 00:35:52,114
{\fs20}come down from mountain
during time of fire, wind.

667
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:57,815
{\fs20}Many brave warrior walk
trail of moon bear...

668
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:01,725
{\fs20}OK. Look, I just want to see your
finest horse, not a whole thing there.

669
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:05,162
{\fs20}- Sorry. I can do it.
- All right.

670
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:08,099
{\fs20}Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari.

671
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,635
{\fs20}Ferrari.

672
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,303
{\fs20}Oh, my.

673
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:17,104
{\fs20}Oh, my, oh, my!

674
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,439
{\fs20}Look at that.

675
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,605
{\fs20}Whoa!

676
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,377
{\fs20}I would get automatic respect
riding such a beautiful animal,

677
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:27,545
{\fs20}but I'm afraid that's just
a bit out of my price range.

678
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:30,749
{\fs20}Tell you what, white bread.

679
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:33,486
{\fs20}I'll give you Ferrari...

680
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:37,094
{\fs20}...for free!

681
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:39,792
{\fs20}Boo-yah! The end. I love it.

682
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:43,632
{\fs20}Brilliant story. So he
got the Ferrari for free.

683
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:45,261
{\fs20}I love that. I love that.

684
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:49,672
{\fs20}A guy getting a free horse?
That's not a good story.

685
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:54,774
{\fs20}Where's the arc? There's no
arc. I've not learned anything.

686
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:57,248
{\fs20}Also, you've got a
moral obligation to them.

687
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:59,342
{\fs20}What are they gonna
walk away from that with?

688
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:02,547
{\fs20}I didn't know we were doing
an After School Special.

689
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:05,182
{\fs20}Why can't he do something
a real gentleman would do,

690
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:07,123
{\fs20}like save a damsel in distress?

691
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,827
{\fs20}Not a bad idea, munchkin.

692
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:14,526
{\fs20}OK. So, uh... let's continue.

693
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:17,161
{\fs20}Jeremiah was out for a ride when...

694
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,433
{\fs20}Oh, please, don't!

695
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:24,307
{\fs20}- Give us that jewelry.
- You want my pearls? Help! Please!

696
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:28,177
{\fs20}Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoo!

697
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:32,718
{\fs20}Oh, my necklace? Here, take it.

698
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:34,720
{\fs20}Come on, boy!

699
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:36,688
{\fs20}Here.

700
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,815
{\fs20}What else you got, sweetie?

701
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:41,122
{\fs20}Help! Help!

702
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,422
{\fs20}Leave the lady alone!

703
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:55,032
{\fs20}Care for a lift, ma'am?

704
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,871
{\fs20}- Yeah.
- Oh!

705
00:37:56,943 --> 00:38:01,312
{\fs20}- Nice horse.
- Oh, what, this old thing?

706
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:04,407
{\fs20}Now, any of you gentlemen want to
give the nice lady her stuff back?

707
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,179
{\fs20}Not a chance, huh?

708
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:08,744
{\fs20}Because I beg to differ!

709
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:11,017
{\fs20}- My hero.
- I like that.

710
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:15,954
{\fs20}So Jeremiah spirited Miss
Davenport away to safety,

711
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,223
{\fs20}when she says...

712
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,663
{\fs20}Shall we go drink champagne
in a nearby hot tub?

713
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:23,965
{\fs20}- Hot tub?
- Mmm.

714
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:25,971
{\fs20}Uh, yeah. No.

715
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,634
{\fs20}I was saying that because I wanted to
see if you two were paying attention.

716
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:35,005
{\fs20}What happened was Jeremiah
dropped Miss Davenport off

717
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:37,413
{\fs20}in the nearest town, safe and sound.

718
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,213
{\fs20}How ever can I thank you, sir?

719
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:41,516
{\fs20}Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am.

720
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:44,557
{\fs20}But I do insist on expressing
my gratitude in some manner.

721
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,786
{\fs20}Fair enough. I'll take...

722
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:51,126
{\fs20}...$100 million.

723
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:53,893
{\fs20}The end. Let's hope it works.

724
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,231
{\fs20}Very well written,
brilliantly constructed.

725
00:38:56,303 --> 00:38:59,534
{\fs20}Jeremiah wouldn't take
money for doing a good deed.

726
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:02,404
{\fs20}Uh... I know Jeremiah a
lot better than you guys.

727
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,966
{\fs20}And believe me, he'd be all
over that. He loves money.

728
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:06,342
{\fs20}Mmm!

729
00:39:06,413 --> 00:39:08,881
{\fs20}I don't want that. Go
back, rewrite. Rewrite.

730
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,746
{\fs20}Gentlemen don't get paid.

731
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:13,251
{\fs20}Will you just... Who's
telling the story here?

732
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,413
{\fs20}It should really end more like this.

733
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:18,423
{\fs20}Well, I must give you some
token of my appreciation.

734
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:19,685
{\fs20}Oh, no.

735
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:21,852
{\fs20}Perhaps... a kiss?

736
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:23,956
{\fs20}Touchdown.

737
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:27,760
{\fs20}Then an angry dwarf kicks him.

738
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:29,301
{\fs20}Ow!

739
00:39:30,403 --> 00:39:32,268
{\fs20}What the heck did you do that for?

740
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,307
{\fs20}Because I'm angry.

741
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,239
{\fs20}Go! Let's go!

742
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,500
{\fs20}All right! Yeah!

743
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:41,304
{\fs20}I didn't do nothing to you!

744
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,576
{\fs20}- The end.
- You know what?

745
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,982
{\fs20}Laugh as much as you
want. I'll take a Ferrari

746
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:48,020
{\fs20}and a kiss any day of the week.

747
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:49,885
{\fs20}I'd just like to kiss a Ferrari.

748
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,358
{\fs20}- All right. Good night.
- Good night, Uncle Skeeter.

749
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:55,951
{\fs20}Good night, home slice.

750
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:58,657
{\fs20}Thanks for the stories.

751
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,632
{\fs20}You came up with all
the good parts, Bobbi.

752
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,531
{\fs20}Good night, y'all.

753
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:04,297
{\fs20}You too there, Bugsy.

754
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:10,702
{\fs20}And them braids look fantastic.
They've taken years off you.

755
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:13,268
{\fs20}You mind sleeping over? I'm
gonna duck out a few hours.

756
00:40:13,346 --> 00:40:16,008
{\fs20}Oh, yeah, yeah. Mmm. By the way, um,

757
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:18,209
{\fs20}I am, uh, legally obliged to tell you

758
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:22,277
{\fs20}that I suffer from...
sleep panic disorder.

759
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:24,880
{\fs20}OK, what's, uh, sleep panic disorder?

760
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,449
{\fs20}Believe me, you don't want to know.

761
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:41,396
{\fs20}What am I thinking? Why would
anyone give me a free Ferrari?

762
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:43,704
{\fs20}I must be losing my mind.

763
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:48,103
{\fs20}Much power of the horse
underneath that hood.

764
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:55,247
{\fs20}Hello.

765
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,287
{\fs20}Are you the guy I'm supposed to see?

766
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:04,189
{\fs20}I'm here, aren't I?

767
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:11,226
{\fs20}So... am I about to get
a cherry red Ferrari?

768
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:15,405
{\fs20}I don't see why not.

769
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:27,151
{\fs20}For... free?

770
00:41:28,288 --> 00:41:33,225
{\fs20}Sounds good to... me!

771
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:37,152
{\fs20}What do I do now? Eat
a gumball or something?

772
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:39,554
{\fs20}Yes.

773
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,238
{\fs20}- Fell out of the sky, right?
- Yeah.

774
00:41:46,306 --> 00:41:47,295
{\fs20}Shh!

775
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:49,364
{\fs20}Oh! Shh.

776
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:50,807
{\fs20}I won't tell nobody.

777
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:56,782
{\fs20}Now, close your eyes and count to three.

778
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,613
{\fs20}- OK.
- Then it's all gonna happen.

779
00:41:58,685 --> 00:41:59,674
{\fs20}- No.
- Yeah.

780
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,780
{\fs20}- One, two...
- Yeah.

781
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:04,949
{\fs20}...three.

782
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:07,322
{\fs20}Ferrari!

783
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:10,453
{\fs20}Hey! My wallet!

784
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,259
{\fs20}Not anymore!

785
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:19,137
{\fs20}Excuse me. Hi, boys.

786
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:24,242
{\fs20}OK, thank you.

787
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:31,840
{\fs20}Thanks, guys. Sorry. I'm
just trying to find my car.

788
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:36,480
{\fs20}Good thing my wallet only
had three dollars in it.

789
00:42:36,556 --> 00:42:39,081
{\fs20}And my Derek Jeter baseball card!

790
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:42,526
{\fs20}Guys, guys, stop, please.

791
00:42:43,763 --> 00:42:46,027
{\fs20}You've had enough, now. Thank you.

792
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,191
{\fs20}Stop!

793
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,765
{\fs20}Come on, man!

794
00:42:56,843 --> 00:42:59,573
{\fs20}- Care for a lift, ma'am?
- Skeeter?

795
00:42:59,646 --> 00:43:01,671
{\fs20}- Skeeter Bronson?
- Yes, ma'am.

796
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:05,644
{\fs20}What do you say you boys

797
00:43:05,718 --> 00:43:08,209
{\fs20}give the pretty lady back
the pictures you took?

798
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:12,987
{\fs20}Sure about that, now?
Because I beg to differ.

799
00:43:14,794 --> 00:43:15,886
{\fs20}Guy's got a gun!

800
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:21,089
{\fs20}I'm just happy they didn't
make me use this thing.

801
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:27,399
{\fs20}- My hero.
- Really?

802
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:29,839
{\fs20}That was brilliant, Skeeter.

803
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:32,878
{\fs20}I don't know what happened.
Something came over me.

804
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:34,413
{\fs20}It felt good. It felt really good.

805
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,380
{\fs20}How am I ever going to thank you?

806
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,212
{\fs20}Hmm.

807
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:40,844
{\fs20}No thanks is necessary, ma'am?

808
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,651
{\fs20}Oh, am I in the presence of a gentleman?

809
00:43:44,724 --> 00:43:46,919
{\fs20}At your service, ma'am.

810
00:43:46,993 --> 00:43:50,485
{\fs20}Well, I must show my
appreciation in some form.

811
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:56,100
{\fs20}Ow!

812
00:43:56,169 --> 00:43:58,831
{\fs20}Consider yourself big
people-bashed, sucker.

813
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:00,395
{\fs20}I knew you were gonna show up.

814
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:03,670
{\fs20}Get in the Gremlin, Jimmy,
before Sasquatch calls the cops.

815
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:06,371
{\fs20}Yeah, 'cause that's how
we do what we do. Right?

816
00:44:06,446 --> 00:44:07,743
{\fs20}That's what you get, buddy.

817
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:11,545
{\fs20}Oh! Oh! Oh! Let's go! Yeah!

818
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:13,916
{\fs20}Pull me in. Let's get
out of here. Pull me in!

819
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,649
{\fs20}Big people stink!

820
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:20,553
{\fs20}OK, well, you don't see that every day.

821
00:44:20,627 --> 00:44:26,395
{\fs20}Indeed. And on that strange
note, I bid you good night.

822
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:29,128
{\fs20}Yes, yes.

823
00:44:29,202 --> 00:44:33,002
{\fs20}Oh! Oh!

824
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:35,939
{\fs20}All right, so that's how I'm getting it.

825
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,069
{\fs20}- Getting what?
- This is just... I shouldn't.

826
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,773
{\fs20}I, I couldn't. You know what?
I can. I'm gonna take it.

827
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:43,748
{\fs20}What are you talking about?

828
00:44:43,816 --> 00:44:46,250
{\fs20}I'm talking about a very generous girl

829
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,119
{\fs20}who wants to give her rescuer
a cherry red Ferrari...

830
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:52,214
{\fs20}...for free!

831
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:54,716
{\fs20}This is sick!

832
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:58,560
{\fs20}Well, uh, good luck with
that. I'm just going to go.

833
00:44:58,631 --> 00:44:59,723
{\fs20}What do you mean?

834
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:01,767
{\fs20}Do you have another one at your house?

835
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:04,268
{\fs20}Am I, am I supposed to
follow you or something?

836
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:06,430
{\fs20}So seriously, no, no Ferrari?

837
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:12,441
{\fs20}Where's the $100 million, at least?!

838
00:45:13,313 --> 00:45:14,507
{\fs20}Boo!

839
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,614
{\fs20}Hey, hey, hey! Get your
own campaign vehicle.

840
00:45:19,686 --> 00:45:21,449
{\fs20}Yeah.

841
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:24,251
{\fs20}- Hi.
- Hey, Aunt Jill.

842
00:45:24,324 --> 00:45:26,349
{\fs20}Hey, guys. How did last night go?

843
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:29,827
{\fs20}An angry dwarf kicked me in the
leg, and I didn't get a free Ferrari.

844
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:30,954
{\fs20}So there you go.

845
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,191
{\fs20}Oh. How sad.

846
00:45:33,266 --> 00:45:36,599
{\fs20}- He's talking about our bedtime story.
- Oh.

847
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:39,900
{\fs20}Uncle Skeeter said Jeremiah
would get a new horse and a kiss,

848
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:41,872
{\fs20}but I said the dwarf would kick him.

849
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,639
{\fs20}You said it.

850
00:45:45,712 --> 00:45:47,680
{\fs20}Maybe that's how it works.

851
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:49,339
{\fs20}The kids control the stories.

852
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,885
{\fs20}And there are the wind chimes.
You know what that means.

853
00:45:53,953 --> 00:45:55,113
{\fs20}What what means?

854
00:45:55,188 --> 00:45:57,383
{\fs20}Huh?

855
00:45:57,457 --> 00:45:59,618
{\fs20}Nothing. Don't worry about it.

856
00:45:59,692 --> 00:46:00,750
{\fs20}I won't.

857
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:05,958
{\fs20}OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing?

858
00:46:08,968 --> 00:46:12,802
{\fs20}Working off the hamburgers
he ate last night.

859
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:15,670
{\fs20}Yes, I gave Bugsy some hamburgers,

860
00:46:15,742 --> 00:46:19,303
{\fs20}but I gave the children
that wheat germ stuff

861
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:21,040
{\fs20}because that's what they love.

862
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:24,413
{\fs20}I guess it's, uh, Bugsy
watching the TV then too?

863
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:27,078
{\fs20}Yeah, I flipped that on
and, look, he's glued to it.

864
00:46:30,923 --> 00:46:32,481
{\fs20}I'm innocent!

865
00:46:33,926 --> 00:46:35,359
{\fs20}What was that?

866
00:46:35,428 --> 00:46:38,659
{\fs20}Uh... that was the sleep
panic disorder, I believe.

867
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:41,700
{\fs20}Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.

868
00:46:41,768 --> 00:46:43,759
{\fs20}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncle a kiss.

869
00:46:43,836 --> 00:46:46,168
{\fs20}I'm a relative, I
deserve it. Right there.

870
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:47,934
{\fs20}Oh, that felt nice.

871
00:46:48,007 --> 00:46:49,941
{\fs20}How about one more for the road?

872
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:53,672
{\fs20}- No.
- Come on, baby!

873
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:56,408
{\fs20}Don't worry, we'll be back tonight.

874
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:57,915
{\fs20}Yeah, no, I'm not worried.

875
00:46:57,984 --> 00:47:00,384
{\fs20}You're coming back, we
got a big story tonight!

876
00:47:00,453 --> 00:47:04,150
{\fs20}About some hotel theme ideas! Yeah!

877
00:47:04,223 --> 00:47:06,919
{\fs20}- Maybe we won't come back.
- What?

878
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:09,553
{\fs20}- Skeeter?
- Sir Butt-Kiss. Sir... Kendall.

879
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:14,362
{\fs20}I understand that you feel a need to
prepare for our little... showdown.

880
00:47:14,434 --> 00:47:16,265
{\fs20}- Yeah.
- That does not excuse you

881
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:18,098
{\fs20}from maintenance responsibilities.

882
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:20,105
{\fs20}- Oh, no. Check.
- Lights are out in the spa.

883
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:22,607
{\fs20}- The south service elevator is slow.
- Check.

884
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:24,233
{\fs20}Let me try that cheesecake.

885
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:27,979
{\fs20}Oh, another thing.

886
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:32,279
{\fs20}I heard about your big hero act
with my girlfriend last night.

887
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,320
{\fs20}- This paparazzi was...
- I know what it is you're trying to do,

888
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:37,151
{\fs20}and it's not gonna work.

889
00:47:37,223 --> 00:47:38,781
{\fs20}You have to find another way

890
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:41,622
{\fs20}to cozy up to the old man
because I'm here to tell you

891
00:47:41,694 --> 00:47:45,926
{\fs20}Violet Nottingham is not gonna
date a gum-scraping handyman.

892
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:49,792
{\fs20}Hey, Kendall.

893
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:55,238
{\fs20}Two things. First off, you
got something right there.

894
00:47:55,308 --> 00:47:59,404
{\fs20}Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.

895
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:02,915
{\fs20}Good. Secondly, when I get
the job at the new hotel,

896
00:48:02,982 --> 00:48:07,146
{\fs20}I was actually considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.

897
00:48:08,488 --> 00:48:12,185
{\fs20}Your brief little trip to
the land of make-believe

898
00:48:12,258 --> 00:48:14,453
{\fs20}is just about over, my friend. OK?

899
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:17,826
{\fs20}We all know your failed father
ran this hotel into the ground,

900
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:20,559
{\fs20}and thankfully, you will
not get the chance to make

901
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,430
{\fs20}the same mistake all over again.

902
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:25,969
{\fs20}May want to pick that up.

903
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:35,111
{\fs20}- It's Duncan.
- Lover, hello.

904
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:36,671
{\fs20}I'm looking for the hotel site.

905
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:38,876
{\fs20}I gave you the address, macho bunny.

906
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:41,681
{\fs20}The address you gave me is no
good. There's a school here.

907
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:44,621
{\fs20}- Oh, what school?
- Webster Elementary School.

908
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,454
{\fs20}- Oh, then you're in the right place.
- Is that so?

909
00:48:47,527 --> 00:48:50,257
{\fs20}- This school is being shut down.
- Uh-huh.

910
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:53,264
{\fs20}The old man pulled a few strings
at the board of education.

911
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:55,857
{\fs20}- Really?
- We start demolition immediately.

912
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:58,062
{\fs20}That is very exciting news.

913
00:48:58,137 --> 00:49:00,367
{\fs20}Oh, Pinky.

914
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:07,879
{\fs20}Hello!

915
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:09,881
{\fs20}Skeeter? Hey, it's Wendy.

916
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:13,146
{\fs20}- Hey, sissy.
- Hey. How's it going?

917
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,847
{\fs20}- Are the kids OK?
- Oh, yeah. We're having a blast.

918
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:17,389
{\fs20}That was impressive, Bobbi,

919
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:20,550
{\fs20}but Uncle Skeeter can jump
over the couch the long way.

920
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:23,959
{\fs20}- Skeeter, can I talk to them?
- No, I'm taking them camping.

921
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,759
{\fs20}- No.
- Have fun in Arizona. Bye!

922
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:28,766
{\fs20}Camping? No, Skeeter,
they could get poison ivy!

923
00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:31,667
{\fs20}- Let's go. Quietly.
- Where are we going?

924
00:49:31,737 --> 00:49:33,705
{\fs20}- Someplace special, fools.
- Whoo-hoo!

925
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:37,504
{\fs20}Now march, march, march, march...

926
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:39,374
{\fs20}I don't know but it's been said

927
00:49:39,445 --> 00:49:41,037
{\fs20}Bugsy's eyes pop out of his head

928
00:49:41,113 --> 00:49:43,343
{\fs20}March, march, march...

929
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:45,543
{\fs20}- Whoo-hoo!
- March, let's go.

930
00:49:47,653 --> 00:49:48,881
{\fs20}Whoa! Cool!

931
00:49:48,955 --> 00:49:51,253
{\fs20}We're going to have
ourselves a camp-out.

932
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:54,384
{\fs20}You guys, look what he's
done! Isn't this cool?

933
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,860
{\fs20}- See? See how nice I am?
- Yeah.

934
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:58,988
{\fs20}Whoa, OK, just be
careful around the fire.

935
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:02,660
{\fs20}Hey, Jill. Shh. Don't want
everyone to hear we're here.

936
00:50:04,904 --> 00:50:09,068
{\fs20}I heard about marshmallows.
Saw them in magazines.

937
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:12,076
{\fs20}I never imagined they
would be this good.

938
00:50:12,144 --> 00:50:15,238
{\fs20}Let's just hope your mother
doesn't find out I gave you any.

939
00:50:15,314 --> 00:50:17,976
{\fs20}- I won't tell her.
- I'm not talking about you.

940
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,312
{\fs20}She's the weak link.

941
00:50:19,385 --> 00:50:21,819
{\fs20}I think I can let this one slide.

942
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:24,947
{\fs20}Ahh! The mermaid's
being cool. Look at that.

943
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:26,889
{\fs20}- The what?
- The nothing.

944
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:32,827
{\fs20}You know, when we were younger and
your mom and I were out on the roof,

945
00:50:32,898 --> 00:50:35,230
{\fs20}my dad would always tell
us to look at the stars

946
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:39,465
{\fs20}and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...

947
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:42,098
{\fs20}Right over there. Right
over there. Look, look.

948
00:50:42,174 --> 00:50:43,801
{\fs20}To me, that looks like a camel.

949
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:45,969
{\fs20}You see the humps? Huh?
The tongue hanging out?

950
00:50:46,045 --> 00:50:47,410
{\fs20}Oh, yeah. I see that.

951
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,505
{\fs20}Hey, look over there! It's a pyramid.

952
00:50:49,582 --> 00:50:51,948
{\fs20}Yeah! Hey, good one, Patrick.

953
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:54,919
{\fs20}Look, right next to the
moon. Right, right beside it.

954
00:50:54,987 --> 00:50:57,012
{\fs20}It looks exactly like Bugsy.

955
00:50:57,089 --> 00:50:59,489
{\fs20}Oh, my God!

956
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:02,493
{\fs20}Don't worry, Bugsy. Your
eyes are still bigger.

957
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:08,526
{\fs20}Uncle Skeeter?

958
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:10,000
{\fs20}Yes, good-looking.

959
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,536
{\fs20}Do you think my father will come back?

960
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:20,473
{\fs20}Um... Well, that's a tough one.

961
00:51:23,382 --> 00:51:27,682
{\fs20}He must be going through
some... mental malfunction

962
00:51:27,753 --> 00:51:32,520
{\fs20}to not want to be with you two
guys every second of the day.

963
00:51:32,591 --> 00:51:37,221
{\fs20}But, uh, I do know this.

964
00:51:37,296 --> 00:51:39,924
{\fs20}You're always going to have your mother.

965
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:43,264
{\fs20}You're always gonna have
this girl to hang out with.

966
00:51:43,335 --> 00:51:46,736
{\fs20}And me, I ain't ever going anywhere.

967
00:51:48,074 --> 00:51:49,564
{\fs20}OK?

968
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:53,578
{\fs20}I'm like the stink on your
feet. I'll always be around.

969
00:51:58,884 --> 00:52:01,978
{\fs20}OK. You guys made me
late. I hope you're happy.

970
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:04,852
{\fs20}Well, thank you. Have
fun at night school.

971
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:08,022
{\fs20}See you tomorrow.

972
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:10,460
{\fs20}All right, we got rid of
her, so let's get to business.

973
00:52:10,529 --> 00:52:12,394
{\fs20}Put the s'mores down. Story time.

974
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:17,332
{\fs20}All right, guys. Tonight's
story's gonna be extra special.

975
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:19,200
{\fs20}It's called...

976
00:52:19,271 --> 00:52:24,174
{\fs20}... The Great Hotel Idea Story.

977
00:52:24,243 --> 00:52:25,335
{\fs20}Yeah!

978
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:27,606
{\fs20}- What?
- Boring.

979
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,580
{\fs20}Come on, guys, I really
need you to do this.

980
00:52:29,648 --> 00:52:31,411
{\fs20}It's gonna help my life a lot. Please?

981
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:33,982
{\fs20}All right, you know what?

982
00:52:34,053 --> 00:52:36,351
{\fs20}We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.

983
00:52:36,422 --> 00:52:38,788
{\fs20}How about some Evel Knievel stuff?

984
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:42,259
{\fs20}Racing, jumping, flying...

985
00:52:42,328 --> 00:52:44,728
{\fs20}Or maybe something like romantic?

986
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,257
{\fs20}I have a good idea.

987
00:52:48,334 --> 00:52:51,462
{\fs20}Let's combine the action and the romance

988
00:52:51,537 --> 00:52:54,199
{\fs20}and make a romaction story.

989
00:52:54,273 --> 00:52:56,400
{\fs20}- Yeah.
- Let us begin.

990
00:52:56,475 --> 00:52:59,911
{\fs20}The greatest of all the
heroes in ancient Greece

991
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:02,447
{\fs20}was, of course, Skeetacus.

992
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:05,917
{\fs20}He was truly amazing

993
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:10,979
{\fs20}yet totally underrated and
had been ignored for years.

994
00:53:11,056 --> 00:53:16,323
{\fs20}Finally Skeetacus had his chance to
show his skills in the grand arena.

995
00:53:18,097 --> 00:53:20,793
{\fs20}If he could impress the
daughter of the emperor,

996
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:23,994
{\fs20}he knew he would one day rule the land.

997
00:53:27,006 --> 00:53:29,566
{\fs20}- Skeetacus, Skeetacus!
- Go on, Skeetacus!

998
00:53:29,642 --> 00:53:32,577
{\fs20}That's pretty fancy chariot work.

999
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:34,078
{\fs20}For a peasant.

1000
00:53:34,146 --> 00:53:36,910
{\fs20}I see London, I see France

1001
00:53:36,982 --> 00:53:39,314
{\fs20}I see my golden underpants

1002
00:53:39,385 --> 00:53:41,114
{\fs20}Whoo!

1003
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:52,624
{\fs20}Oh, wh... what is he doing?

1004
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:54,891
{\fs20}Whoa!

1005
00:53:59,705 --> 00:54:01,138
{\fs20}Bring on the elephants!

1006
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,010
{\fs20}- Whoa.
- Ooh.

1007
00:54:07,413 --> 00:54:08,937
{\fs20}All right.

1008
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:10,709
{\fs20}You know how Hercules

1009
00:54:10,783 --> 00:54:12,751
{\fs20}supposedly founded the Olympics?

1010
00:54:17,523 --> 00:54:21,550
{\fs20}Well, Skeetacus invented the X Games.

1011
00:54:21,627 --> 00:54:23,151
{\fs20}He's never gonna make it!

1012
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:37,907
{\fs20}Now that's first class.

1013
00:54:39,445 --> 00:54:40,537
{\fs20}Hey!

1014
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:42,478
{\fs20}- Bravo!
- Wow.

1015
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:47,250
{\fs20}Can you dig it?

1016
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:49,514
{\fs20}Skeetacus!

1017
00:54:49,588 --> 00:54:51,419
{\fs20}How we doing so far, huh?

1018
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:55,517
{\fs20}- This is the best story yet.
- Can we get to the romance now?

1019
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:57,391
{\fs20}Well, shorty, you tell me?

1020
00:54:57,463 --> 00:54:59,988
{\fs20}Does Skeetacus get
the girl he was after?

1021
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:01,532
{\fs20}In these stories,

1022
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,091
{\fs20}the hero always gets the
fairest maiden in the land.

1023
00:55:04,169 --> 00:55:06,660
{\fs20}Yes! You said it! OK,
so it's gonna happen!

1024
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:09,799
{\fs20}Uh, right. So, what? They're
thirsty? They go off for drinks?

1025
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:12,343
{\fs20}A little wine and cheese action? Yes?

1026
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:17,405
{\fs20}Yeah, they can go to an old
tavern. And guess who's there?

1027
00:55:17,483 --> 00:55:19,417
{\fs20}Led Zeppelin. Say Led Zeppelin, please.

1028
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:23,387
{\fs20}No. All the girls that were
mean to Skeetacus growing up.

1029
00:55:23,455 --> 00:55:25,753
{\fs20}What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1030
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:27,655
{\fs20}He was like the coolest guy in school.

1031
00:55:27,726 --> 00:55:29,694
{\fs20}That's not what Mom said.

1032
00:55:29,762 --> 00:55:31,753
{\fs20}All right, everybody
was mean to Skeetacus.

1033
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,594
{\fs20}He had problems. All
right, tell your story.

1034
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:35,964
{\fs20}Oh, my God...

1035
00:55:36,035 --> 00:55:37,366
{\fs20}They see he's now with

1036
00:55:37,436 --> 00:55:39,199
{\fs20}the fairest maiden in all the land,

1037
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:42,638
{\fs20}and they are really jealous.

1038
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,869
{\fs20}So jealous they don't know what to do.

1039
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:47,777
{\fs20}They just start nervously
doing the hokey-pokey.

1040
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:49,677
{\fs20}Put your right hand in

1041
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:51,545
{\fs20}You put your right hand out

1042
00:55:51,617 --> 00:55:53,312
{\fs20}You put your right hand in

1043
00:55:53,385 --> 00:55:55,319
{\fs20}And you shake it all about

1044
00:55:56,689 --> 00:55:58,247
{\fs20}OK.

1045
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:00,349
{\fs20}So then,

1046
00:56:00,426 --> 00:56:03,088
{\fs20}Skeetacus takes his
date out to the beach.

1047
00:56:03,162 --> 00:56:06,359
{\fs20}All of a sudden, a big hairy guy

1048
00:56:06,432 --> 00:56:09,731
{\fs20}washes up onshore, passed out.

1049
00:56:09,802 --> 00:56:11,667
{\fs20}Why a hairy guy? I don't get it.

1050
00:56:11,737 --> 00:56:12,829
{\fs20}Just 'cause.

1051
00:56:12,905 --> 00:56:16,102
{\fs20}He had something stuck in his
throat, and he wasn't breathing.

1052
00:56:19,712 --> 00:56:23,307
{\fs20}- Thanks.
- He's OK.

1053
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:26,579
{\fs20}And then it starts pouring, so
they run into a magical cave.

1054
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:29,621
{\fs20}- Caves are nice.
- And Abe Lincoln's there.

1055
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:32,020
{\fs20}Abe Lincoln? What,
is this a joke to you?

1056
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:34,958
{\fs20}What the heck's the matter
with you? Oh, I'm sorry.

1057
00:56:35,027 --> 00:56:36,221
{\fs20}I, I didn't mean to yell.

1058
00:56:36,295 --> 00:56:38,786
{\fs20}The Abe Lincoln thing,
that's, that's a good idea.

1059
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:42,823
{\fs20}It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?

1060
00:56:42,901 --> 00:56:46,302
{\fs20}Don't you think he should?
It's... been a long time for him.

1061
00:56:46,372 --> 00:56:51,469
{\fs20}His lips are very dry
from not using them.

1062
00:56:51,543 --> 00:56:53,170
{\fs20}Bugsy, you with me?

1063
00:56:56,215 --> 00:56:57,807
{\fs20}We'll see.

1064
00:56:57,883 --> 00:57:00,443
{\fs20}- Hello?
- Mmm.

1065
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:03,147
{\fs20}Hey, is this the fairest
maiden in the land?

1066
00:57:03,222 --> 00:57:05,247
{\fs20}Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?

1067
00:57:05,324 --> 00:57:08,623
{\fs20}Yes, it is. Sorry about that
Ferrari confusion the other night.

1068
00:57:08,694 --> 00:57:12,130
{\fs20}I'm here at the beach right now and
I had a hunch you might be here too.

1069
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:13,960
{\fs20}What do you say we
get a little lunchsky?

1070
00:57:14,033 --> 00:57:15,523
{\fs20}That sounds so delightful.

1071
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:18,627
{\fs20}But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.

1072
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:21,066
{\fs20}Vegas?

1073
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,506
{\fs20}Uh, no one talked about Vegas.

1074
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:25,839
{\fs20}Don't tell Kendall. He
thinks I'm in the library.

1075
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:28,243
{\fs20}Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,

1076
00:57:28,313 --> 00:57:30,508
{\fs20}I, I really thought we
were gonna hang out today.

1077
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:33,312
{\fs20}Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.

1078
00:57:33,385 --> 00:57:34,374
{\fs20}Bye, Skeeter.

1079
00:57:35,587 --> 00:57:37,316
{\fs20}Hmm.

1080
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:40,415
{\fs20}So our date's gonna be
tomorrow? I can live with that.

1081
00:57:40,492 --> 00:57:43,518
{\fs20}Hey! Look out! Look out!

1082
00:57:43,595 --> 00:57:47,964
{\fs20}Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!

1083
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:51,264
{\fs20}What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?

1084
00:57:51,336 --> 00:57:53,861
{\fs20}Aren't you supposed to be in school?

1085
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:55,804
{\fs20}I'm supposed to be
looking for a job now,

1086
00:57:55,874 --> 00:57:59,037
{\fs20}but for some reason I felt
like coming to the beach today.

1087
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:00,339
{\fs20}Huh.

1088
00:58:00,412 --> 00:58:01,879
{\fs20}Um, are you hungry?

1089
00:58:01,947 --> 00:58:04,939
{\fs20}Yes, I'm always hungry when I'm in pain.

1090
00:58:05,017 --> 00:58:07,110
{\fs20}Good. Because I'm buying.

1091
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:09,950
{\fs20}I'll let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,

1092
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:13,219
{\fs20}- so how was I gonna pay?
- Of course you got your wallet stolen.

1093
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:16,625
{\fs20}- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's always something with you.

1094
00:58:16,695 --> 00:58:18,526
{\fs20}- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.

1095
00:58:18,597 --> 00:58:21,122
{\fs20}- Gonna wear that all day?
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat.

1096
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,896
{\fs20}- I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
- I'll take it back. Thanks.

1097
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:32,106
{\fs20}This is perfect for your free lunch.

1098
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:35,237
{\fs20}Oh, my gosh. You guys, you
guys, you guys. Over there.

1099
00:58:35,314 --> 00:58:37,248
{\fs20}Is that... is that Skeeter Bronson?

1100
00:58:37,316 --> 00:58:38,783
{\fs20}- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.

1101
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:41,217
{\fs20}- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.

1102
00:58:41,286 --> 00:58:43,481
{\fs20}Hey! Do you remember me?

1103
00:58:43,555 --> 00:58:46,456
{\fs20}It's Donna Hynde from high school.

1104
00:58:46,525 --> 00:58:48,288
{\fs20}Yeah, I do.

1105
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,955
{\fs20}Thought I was going to run into
you shortly. And here you are.

1106
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,261
{\fs20}Yeah. Wow, this is so... weird. Uh...

1107
00:58:55,334 --> 00:58:57,802
{\fs20}We were just planning
our high school reunion.

1108
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:01,135
{\fs20}We were totally just talking
about you. It's so weird.

1109
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:03,174
{\fs20}I was just talking about you guys too.

1110
00:59:03,242 --> 00:59:04,732
{\fs20}Sure, he was.

1111
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,472
{\fs20}Mind pretending to be my
girlfriend for a second?

1112
00:59:07,546 --> 00:59:09,480
{\fs20}Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

1113
00:59:09,548 --> 00:59:11,914
{\fs20}I'll, uh, convert my truck to biodiesel.

1114
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:15,342
{\fs20}- OK, I'll do it.
- Ding-dong.

1115
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,583
{\fs20}Uh, this is my girlfriend,
guys. This is Jill.

1116
00:59:18,657 --> 00:59:20,352
{\fs20}Hello.

1117
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:21,949
{\fs20}She's your girlfriend?

1118
00:59:22,027 --> 00:59:23,460
{\fs20}Yeah. Yeah.

1119
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:25,087
{\fs20}Yes, I am.

1120
00:59:25,164 --> 00:59:26,495
{\fs20}- Right?
- Yup.

1121
00:59:26,565 --> 00:59:28,795
{\fs20}She thinks I'm...

1122
00:59:28,867 --> 00:59:32,268
{\fs20}You want me to... Oh. Uh... romantic.

1123
00:59:32,337 --> 00:59:34,202
{\fs20}She likes how romantic I can be.

1124
00:59:34,273 --> 00:59:37,299
{\fs20}And, uh, "great kisser,"
she likes to say.

1125
00:59:37,376 --> 00:59:40,709
{\fs20}Oh, yeah. That's... a little too much.

1126
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:43,839
{\fs20}- Oh. Sorry.
- Wow, you are really pretty.

1127
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:46,214
{\fs20}- I mean, she's all right.
- Thanks.

1128
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:49,152
{\fs20}I've seen hotter, but she's pretty cool.

1129
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:50,552
{\fs20}So super skinny.

1130
00:59:50,622 --> 00:59:54,251
{\fs20}Skinnier than you. But... Yeah.

1131
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:56,651
{\fs20}Whatever.

1132
00:59:56,728 --> 00:59:59,356
{\fs20}I feel really awful
saying this out loud.

1133
00:59:59,431 --> 01:00:04,198
{\fs20}We were really terrible to Skeeter
in high school. Awful. So mean.

1134
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:05,702
{\fs20}My Skeeter?

1135
01:00:05,771 --> 01:00:08,171
{\fs20}- They were.
- You had a hard time in high school?

1136
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,903
{\fs20}Look at you now. You
turned out pretty... cute.

1137
01:00:11,977 --> 01:00:13,535
{\fs20}- Yeah!
- You know...

1138
01:00:13,612 --> 01:00:16,740
{\fs20}the pimples went away,
and, uh, these came to play.

1139
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:21,249
{\fs20}- You want to touch them?
- Oh, that's OK.

1140
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,448
{\fs20}- Later, later.
- They're here for you. Ding-dong.

1141
01:00:25,724 --> 01:00:27,385
{\fs20}You put your right hand in

1142
01:00:27,459 --> 01:00:29,859
{\fs20}You put your right hand out

1143
01:00:29,928 --> 01:00:31,520
{\fs20}You put your right hand in

1144
01:00:31,597 --> 01:00:33,462
{\fs20}- And you shake it all about
- OK.

1145
01:00:33,532 --> 01:00:35,557
{\fs20}- I think we should leave.
- Yes.

1146
01:00:35,634 --> 01:00:37,499
{\fs20}And you turn yourself around

1147
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:40,003
{\fs20}- All right. Bye-bye.
- That's what it's all about

1148
01:00:40,072 --> 01:00:41,334
{\fs20}What's happening?

1149
01:00:41,406 --> 01:00:43,704
{\fs20}Hey, so I spoke to Wendy.

1150
01:00:43,775 --> 01:00:45,675
{\fs20}She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.

1151
01:00:45,744 --> 01:00:47,769
{\fs20}This is the longest
she's been away from them.

1152
01:00:47,846 --> 01:00:52,442
{\fs20}That's right. This is my
last night with the kids.

1153
01:00:52,517 --> 01:00:54,314
{\fs20}You know, they're gonna be devastated.

1154
01:00:54,386 --> 01:00:56,047
{\fs20}They worship you

1155
01:00:56,121 --> 01:00:58,885
{\fs20}and those amazing bedtime
stories you've been telling them.

1156
01:00:58,957 --> 01:01:01,721
{\fs20}Oh, well, they say all
the good parts. I promise.

1157
01:01:01,793 --> 01:01:03,886
{\fs20}Oh, my gosh. Is he unconscious?

1158
01:01:03,962 --> 01:01:05,054
{\fs20}Yeah, yeah.

1159
01:01:07,532 --> 01:01:09,966
{\fs20}Boom! Oh.

1160
01:01:11,503 --> 01:01:12,800
{\fs20}Thanks!

1161
01:01:13,872 --> 01:01:15,032
{\fs20}Whoa!

1162
01:01:15,107 --> 01:01:16,972
{\fs20}- Yeah?
- Check out Mr. Smooth.

1163
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:20,637
{\fs20}Well, you know, I do what I do.

1164
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:23,272
{\fs20}- Think we should get out of this rain?
- What rain?

1165
01:01:25,951 --> 01:01:27,680
{\fs20}Oh, shoot! Where did that come from?

1166
01:01:27,753 --> 01:01:29,550
{\fs20}I don't know! Isn't it amazing?

1167
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:32,749
{\fs20}- Let's get out of this!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!

1168
01:01:34,726 --> 01:01:36,990
{\fs20}I can read the future.

1169
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:42,325
{\fs20}Good God. So...

1170
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:46,667
{\fs20}So... The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?

1171
01:01:46,738 --> 01:01:49,400
{\fs20}I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...

1172
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:50,805
{\fs20}good luck on it anyway.

1173
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:52,241
{\fs20}- Thank you.
- Yep.

1174
01:01:52,311 --> 01:01:56,645
{\fs20}Actually, you can come if
you want. It's like a party.

1175
01:01:56,715 --> 01:01:59,445
{\fs20}You know, Wendy's gonna
be watching the kids,

1176
01:01:59,518 --> 01:02:00,815
{\fs20}and we could have fun.

1177
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:02,513
{\fs20}You can meet me there.

1178
01:02:03,555 --> 01:02:05,648
{\fs20}Yeah. That would, uh...

1179
01:02:05,724 --> 01:02:09,387
{\fs20}I could do that. I could meet you, um...

1180
01:02:09,461 --> 01:02:12,089
{\fs20}...after night school or something.

1181
01:02:13,999 --> 01:02:16,092
{\fs20}It's you?

1182
01:02:16,168 --> 01:02:18,329
{\fs20}It's me what?

1183
01:02:19,938 --> 01:02:22,839
{\fs20}You're the fairest maiden in the land?

1184
01:02:24,876 --> 01:02:28,073
{\fs20}"Fair" as in "doesn't
cheat at checkers"?

1185
01:02:30,115 --> 01:02:32,583
{\fs20}No, fairest as in...

1186
01:02:34,186 --> 01:02:36,211
{\fs20}..."beautifulest."

1187
01:02:46,198 --> 01:02:49,065
{\fs20}Wait, wait. Something
weird's gonna happen.

1188
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:52,000
{\fs20}Oh.

1189
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:55,164
{\fs20}No, yeah, we don't... This is a mistake.

1190
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,176
{\fs20}No, no, no, not between
us. I mean like, some...

1191
01:02:59,244 --> 01:03:02,111
{\fs20}No! No, no! Oh, here comes Abe!

1192
01:03:02,948 --> 01:03:04,711
{\fs20}No!

1193
01:03:13,592 --> 01:03:15,184
{\fs20}Ah! Look.

1194
01:03:16,161 --> 01:03:18,686
{\fs20}- Wow, a penny.
- No, no, no.

1195
01:03:18,764 --> 01:03:21,858
{\fs20}This is the weird thing I was
talking about. Abe Lincoln.

1196
01:03:21,933 --> 01:03:24,834
{\fs20}- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

1197
01:03:24,903 --> 01:03:27,838
{\fs20}Abe's not gonna interrupt
this time. That was it.

1198
01:03:27,906 --> 01:03:29,635
{\fs20}It's supposed to end better than this.

1199
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:32,768
{\fs20}Stick around. I'm tellin' ya,
you're gonna be missing out.

1200
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:36,540
{\fs20}Nice imagination, Patrick.

1201
01:03:44,389 --> 01:03:46,118
{\fs20}- Skeeter?
- Yo.

1202
01:03:46,191 --> 01:03:48,921
{\fs20}We've got a little bit of a
shaving situation in there.

1203
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:51,326
{\fs20}Oh, no, no, no. I took
the razor blades out.

1204
01:03:51,396 --> 01:03:53,227
{\fs20}Don't worry. Their father ain't around,

1205
01:03:53,298 --> 01:03:55,459
{\fs20}I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.

1206
01:03:57,102 --> 01:03:59,536
{\fs20}I'm Princess Leia.

1207
01:03:59,604 --> 01:04:01,299
{\fs20}Uh-huh.

1208
01:04:03,074 --> 01:04:05,634
{\fs20}So, are you ready for the
big showdown tomorrow night?

1209
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:06,699
{\fs20}Oh, yeah.

1210
01:04:06,778 --> 01:04:08,075
{\fs20}What I'm going to do is

1211
01:04:08,146 --> 01:04:10,080
{\fs20}tell them a bedtime story tonight.

1212
01:04:10,148 --> 01:04:12,946
{\fs20}I'll have me win in the story.

1213
01:04:13,018 --> 01:04:16,545
{\fs20}Then I'll win for reals. Do you dig?

1214
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:18,316
{\fs20}Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.

1215
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,620
{\fs20}So it's like, um,
positive visualization.

1216
01:04:20,692 --> 01:04:22,421
{\fs20}I read a book on that once.

1217
01:04:23,395 --> 01:04:25,693
{\fs20}Read the back cover, at least.

1218
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,097
{\fs20}I can't read.

1219
01:04:31,636 --> 01:04:33,866
{\fs20}Shut up, Bugsy!

1220
01:04:33,939 --> 01:04:36,567
{\fs20}I've got opposable thumbs.
How do you feel about that?

1221
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:40,235
{\fs20}You children ready?

1222
01:04:40,312 --> 01:04:43,042
{\fs20}Because here comes our last story.

1223
01:04:44,216 --> 01:04:46,912
{\fs20}The fate of the entire universe

1224
01:04:46,985 --> 01:04:48,816
{\fs20}hung in the balance,

1225
01:04:48,887 --> 01:04:51,151
{\fs20}as the Supreme Galactic Council

1226
01:04:51,223 --> 01:04:53,657
{\fs20}met to determine who would control

1227
01:04:53,725 --> 01:04:58,924
{\fs20}the new planet in the vast
Nottinghamian star system.

1228
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:04,634
{\fs20}Most in attendance expected
Supreme Leader Barracto

1229
01:05:04,703 --> 01:05:07,900
{\fs20}to rule in favor of General Kendallo,

1230
01:05:07,973 --> 01:05:10,806
{\fs20}the evil governor of Hotelium.

1231
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:15,072
{\fs20}But there was a wild card in the mix...

1232
01:05:16,214 --> 01:05:18,842
{\fs20}... Skeeto Bronsonnian

1233
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:21,943
{\fs20}and his sidekick, Mickey Doo Quicky Doo.

1234
01:05:23,588 --> 01:05:25,488
{\fs20}They all watched with excitement.

1235
01:05:25,557 --> 01:05:28,117
{\fs20}Lieutenant Jilli and
her two young cadets,

1236
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:32,220
{\fs20}Aspenoff, and even the
great Captain Bugzoid.

1237
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:36,825
{\fs20}Hey, since it's outer space, Skeeto
should talk like a goofy alien.

1238
01:05:36,902 --> 01:05:40,065
{\fs20}What?

1239
01:05:42,307 --> 01:05:45,208
{\fs20}That's disgusting. I'm not
going to translate that.

1240
01:05:45,277 --> 01:05:46,505
{\fs20}Silence!

1241
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:47,977
{\fs20}The leader of the new planet

1242
01:05:48,046 --> 01:05:51,243
{\fs20}shall be determined
the old-fashioned way:

1243
01:05:51,316 --> 01:05:54,547
{\fs20}A zero-gravity fight.

1244
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:09,597
{\fs20}OK, now we get to the
part the crowd came to see.

1245
01:06:09,668 --> 01:06:12,762
{\fs20}Skeeto defeating Kendallo, right?

1246
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:17,333
{\fs20}I think we need to
see them battle first.

1247
01:06:29,721 --> 01:06:31,916
{\fs20}Kendallo makes the first move.

1248
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:44,901
{\fs20}- Skeeto!
- But the kids

1249
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:47,165
{\fs20}really want to see Skeeto
kick his butt, right?

1250
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:58,077
{\fs20}Wet willy.

1251
01:06:58,149 --> 01:07:00,674
{\fs20}Boring!

1252
01:07:00,752 --> 01:07:03,414
{\fs20}Uh, bring out the booger monster!

1253
01:07:07,726 --> 01:07:09,887
{\fs20}Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

1254
01:07:19,671 --> 01:07:23,266
{\fs20}All right, have the booger
monster smack Kendallo around.

1255
01:07:23,341 --> 01:07:25,741
{\fs20}No, I think he should kiss him.

1256
01:07:28,613 --> 01:07:30,945
{\fs20}Would you get to Skeeto winning already?

1257
01:07:31,016 --> 01:07:32,950
{\fs20}OK.

1258
01:07:36,087 --> 01:07:37,850
{\fs20}Whoa!

1259
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:47,764
{\fs20}Arise, Skeeto, sharif of Nottinghamia.

1260
01:07:57,108 --> 01:07:58,575
{\fs20}- Whoopee!
- Whoo!

1261
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:03,707
{\fs20}And that is the perfect ending

1262
01:08:03,782 --> 01:08:05,647
{\fs20}to our last story.

1263
01:08:05,717 --> 01:08:07,184
{\fs20}Thank you, children.

1264
01:08:07,252 --> 01:08:08,844
{\fs20}Oh, that's not the ending.

1265
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,820
{\fs20}Yeah. That would be too obvious.

1266
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:11,878
{\fs20}What do you mean?

1267
01:08:11,956 --> 01:08:13,548
{\fs20}Somebody threw a fireball at Skeeto

1268
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:15,786
{\fs20}and Skeeto got incineratated.

1269
01:08:17,762 --> 01:08:20,322
{\fs20}- The end.
- "Incineratated"?

1270
01:08:20,398 --> 01:08:23,697
{\fs20}You mean "incinerated"?

1271
01:08:23,768 --> 01:08:26,896
{\fs20}No! No, no! He can't catch on fire.

1272
01:08:26,971 --> 01:08:29,565
{\fs20}Yeah. I'm Captain Skeeto. I'm on fire!

1273
01:08:29,641 --> 01:08:32,075
{\fs20}No, no, no. The story
can't end like that.

1274
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:33,974
{\fs20}What happened to a nice, happy ending?

1275
01:08:34,045 --> 01:08:37,173
{\fs20}You said happy endings
don't really happen.

1276
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:38,738
{\fs20}We want our story to be real.

1277
01:08:38,817 --> 01:08:41,047
{\fs20}Oh, I was just saying
that. I was stupid.

1278
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:42,677
{\fs20}No, no, no, no, no.

1279
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:45,245
{\fs20}So, what? We're really going
to have me on fire? Hey!

1280
01:08:45,323 --> 01:08:48,451
{\fs20}Don't fall asleep, or the story
will lock. Stop it! Wake up!

1281
01:08:48,526 --> 01:08:50,926
{\fs20}Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

1282
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:54,463
{\fs20}I can't believe Skeeter didn't tell you.

1283
01:08:54,532 --> 01:08:57,524
{\fs20}And I'm sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hotel

1284
01:08:57,602 --> 01:09:01,470
{\fs20}is going up right here where
the, where the school is.

1285
01:09:01,539 --> 01:09:03,439
{\fs20}Well, I'm pretty sure...

1286
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:04,497
{\fs20}Excuse me. Yeah.

1287
01:09:04,576 --> 01:09:06,703
{\fs20}Everything's ready for the presentation.

1288
01:09:06,778 --> 01:09:08,245
{\fs20}- Good.
- Ten-four, rubber duck.

1289
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:09,905
{\fs20}Got it. Great.

1290
01:09:13,351 --> 01:09:14,375
{\fs20}Oh, uh

1291
01:09:14,452 --> 01:09:17,080
{\fs20}Fire

1292
01:09:20,692 --> 01:09:23,160
{\fs20}Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire

1293
01:09:25,563 --> 01:09:26,860
{\fs20}Is this burning

1294
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:28,159
{\fs20}An et...

1295
01:09:29,634 --> 01:09:31,659
{\fs20}Burn, baby, burn

1296
01:09:33,471 --> 01:09:37,373
{\fs20}OK. The good news is, you're
going to win the competition.

1297
01:09:37,442 --> 01:09:40,377
{\fs20}The bad news is, you're
probably gonna catch on fire,

1298
01:09:40,445 --> 01:09:43,539
{\fs20}but not if you take a few precautions.

1299
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:46,644
{\fs20}Oven mitts, smoke alarm.

1300
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:51,210
{\fs20}Yeah.

1301
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:56,019
{\fs20}"Flame-resistant Christmas
tree spray." Yeah.

1302
01:09:57,562 --> 01:09:59,928
{\fs20}Yeah. Yeah, yeah, this will work.

1303
01:10:00,698 --> 01:10:01,756
{\fs20}Excuse me. Sir?

1304
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,664
{\fs20}Those are actually for Christmas trees.

1305
01:10:03,735 --> 01:10:04,793
{\fs20}I know. 'Tis the season.

1306
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:07,064
{\fs20}- Ow! God!
- I'm so sorry.

1307
01:10:07,138 --> 01:10:08,605
{\fs20}It burns!

1308
01:10:08,673 --> 01:10:09,970
{\fs20}Here, let me make it up to you.

1309
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:11,838
{\fs20}- Ow!
- It's for trees!

1310
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:13,309
{\fs20}It's for trees!

1311
01:10:13,378 --> 01:10:15,039
{\fs20}You're right! That hurts!

1312
01:10:16,381 --> 01:10:18,315
{\fs20}I'm sorry about that!

1313
01:10:27,192 --> 01:10:29,854
{\fs20}Antibacterial wipes, anybody?

1314
01:10:29,928 --> 01:10:32,089
{\fs20}Aloha. Aloha.

1315
01:10:32,163 --> 01:10:33,596
{\fs20}Thank you so much.

1316
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,397
{\fs20}Whoa!

1317
01:10:38,503 --> 01:10:41,495
{\fs20}Steady. Steady.

1318
01:10:46,845 --> 01:10:49,313
{\fs20}- Kona coffee ice cream.
- Yeah? What's the catch?

1319
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,008
{\fs20}You're gonna light it on fire?
'Cause I'm on to you, honey.

1320
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,142
{\fs20}No fire. It would melt.

1321
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:56,813
{\fs20}Just take the ice
cream and a chill pill.

1322
01:11:06,564 --> 01:11:09,055
{\fs20}- Ah!
- Boo!

1323
01:11:09,133 --> 01:11:11,567
{\fs20}- Skeeter.
- Yes.

1324
01:11:11,636 --> 01:11:13,695
{\fs20}- That wasn't very nice.
- What wasn't?

1325
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:16,239
{\fs20}- You pushed that man in the pool.
- No, he jumped in.

1326
01:11:16,307 --> 01:11:17,433
{\fs20}Hey, you see Jill around?

1327
01:11:17,508 --> 01:11:20,375
{\fs20}No, I ain't, I ain't
seen Jill tonight, mate.

1328
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:27,043
{\fs20}Ooh! I am cold.

1329
01:11:27,118 --> 01:11:29,712
{\fs20}I'll get you a towel.

1330
01:11:29,787 --> 01:11:31,516
{\fs20}- I've got your towel.
- Oh, blimey.

1331
01:11:31,589 --> 01:11:33,250
{\fs20}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1332
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,322
{\fs20}I love you.

1333
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:43,691
{\fs20}You brought me a grilled
cheese sandwich once.

1334
01:11:43,768 --> 01:11:44,757
{\fs20}Yeah. I did, yes.

1335
01:11:44,836 --> 01:11:46,736
{\fs20}It was Monterey Jack.
It's a good cheese.

1336
01:11:50,241 --> 01:11:52,106
{\fs20}Ow!

1337
01:11:52,176 --> 01:11:53,438
{\fs20}Skeeter, are you all right?

1338
01:11:53,511 --> 01:11:56,275
{\fs20}A bee stung my tongue!

1339
01:11:58,249 --> 01:12:02,242
{\fs20}The meeting for the exciting new hotel
will take place in the living room.

1340
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,118
{\fs20}So I don't think you're
going to want to miss this.

1341
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:07,350
{\fs20}No, it's swelling up!

1342
01:12:11,663 --> 01:12:14,962
{\fs20}- Can I sit there, please, mate?
- Yes, of course.

1343
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:17,433
{\fs20}- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.

1344
01:12:17,502 --> 01:12:20,300
{\fs20}Before we begin, I
would just like to say,

1345
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:23,033
{\fs20}personally, happy birthday.

1346
01:12:23,107 --> 01:12:24,631
{\fs20}Happy birthday.

1347
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:25,971
{\fs20}Happy birthday, Daddy.

1348
01:12:26,044 --> 01:12:27,375
{\fs20}Thank you, Kendall.

1349
01:12:27,445 --> 01:12:30,039
{\fs20}Yes, now, as you can see,

1350
01:12:30,114 --> 01:12:32,412
{\fs20}I've invited some of the staff to sit in

1351
01:12:32,483 --> 01:12:36,180
{\fs20}to see how your ideas would
play with the "regular folk."

1352
01:12:36,254 --> 01:12:39,280
{\fs20}- No offense.
- None taken, Barry. None taken.

1353
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:41,717
{\fs20}So, gentlemen,

1354
01:12:41,793 --> 01:12:43,727
{\fs20}which of you would like to go first?

1355
01:12:46,264 --> 01:12:47,356
{\fs20}Fair enough.

1356
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,666
{\fs20}Mr. Nottingham, you
were absolutely right

1357
01:12:51,736 --> 01:12:55,228
{\fs20}when you said the rock
and roll theme was old hat.

1358
01:12:57,709 --> 01:13:00,439
{\fs20}Gone. Your insight, sir,

1359
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:03,571
{\fs20}has inspired me to, to dig deeper,

1360
01:13:03,648 --> 01:13:06,481
{\fs20}to find the commonality at the heart

1361
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:08,018
{\fs20}of the American experience.

1362
01:13:08,086 --> 01:13:10,020
{\fs20}I speak, of course...

1363
01:13:10,088 --> 01:13:12,022
{\fs20}...of the musical theater.

1364
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:14,650
{\fs20}And, more specifically...

1365
01:13:15,593 --> 01:13:16,924
{\fs20}...Broadway!

1366
01:13:20,365 --> 01:13:21,832
{\fs20}Hit it.

1367
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:26,029
{\fs20}Oh, when you first pull up

1368
01:13:26,104 --> 01:13:28,129
{\fs20}To the grand front door

1369
01:13:28,206 --> 01:13:31,437
{\fs20}There isn't just a
bellhop There's an overture

1370
01:13:31,509 --> 01:13:36,970
{\fs20}At the Nottingham Broadway Mega Resort

1371
01:13:37,048 --> 01:13:40,017
{\fs20}Oh there's a pool for the Sharks

1372
01:13:40,084 --> 01:13:41,813
{\fs20}A pool for the Jets

1373
01:13:41,886 --> 01:13:45,549
{\fs20}And you can bring Cats
'cause we take pets

1374
01:13:45,623 --> 01:13:47,318
{\fs20}At the Nottingham Broadway

1375
01:13:47,392 --> 01:13:52,728
{\fs20}Mega Resort

1376
01:13:59,137 --> 01:14:03,005
{\fs20}Original, impressive, well done.

1377
01:14:03,074 --> 01:14:04,302
{\fs20}Thank you, Kendall.

1378
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:06,172
{\fs20}Thank you, sir.

1379
01:14:13,184 --> 01:14:15,209
{\fs20}Uh, sorry about that.

1380
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:18,255
{\fs20}I was, uh, just resting my eyes.

1381
01:14:21,893 --> 01:14:24,487
{\fs20}Skeeter. You're up.

1382
01:14:41,345 --> 01:14:42,835
{\fs20}Are you all right, Skeeter?

1383
01:14:44,749 --> 01:14:47,309
{\fs20}A bee bit my tongue.

1384
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:49,043
{\fs20}I'm sorry?

1385
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,851
{\fs20}A bee... stung my tongue.

1386
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:58,492
{\fs20}"A bee stung my tongue."

1387
01:14:58,563 --> 01:15:01,555
{\fs20}Oh, you understand him? Oh.

1388
01:15:01,632 --> 01:15:04,965
{\fs20}How did a bee sting your tongue?

1389
01:15:05,036 --> 01:15:06,401
{\fs20}Uh...

1390
01:15:06,471 --> 01:15:08,939
{\fs20}I was eating ice cream,
and suddenly a bee...

1391
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:12,464
{\fs20}Uh, it was on an ice
cream, and he licked it.

1392
01:15:12,543 --> 01:15:16,570
{\fs20}Hmm. Can you translate
Skeeter's presentation for us?

1393
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:18,945
{\fs20}- Mmm!
- Uh... Yes!

1394
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:20,483
{\fs20}Yes, I can do that.

1395
01:15:22,787 --> 01:15:24,379
{\fs20}Thank you. Ready?

1396
01:15:24,455 --> 01:15:26,514
{\fs20}- I'm ready. OK.
- Ready?

1397
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:38,065
{\fs20}"I spent the last week in the
hotel, the hotel where I live..."

1398
01:15:38,136 --> 01:15:40,434
{\fs20}With my niece and nephew.

1399
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:42,837
{\fs20}"With my niece and my nephew."

1400
01:15:47,311 --> 01:15:52,271
{\fs20}"To a kid, everything about a
hotel is strange and wonderful."

1401
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:56,411
{\fs20}"Sleeping in a different bed."

1402
01:15:58,122 --> 01:15:59,680
{\fs20}"Hanging out in the lobby."

1403
01:16:01,893 --> 01:16:04,123
{\fs20}"Jumping up and down on the alligator."

1404
01:16:09,267 --> 01:16:11,997
{\fs20}"Riding up and down in the elevator."

1405
01:16:12,069 --> 01:16:13,127
{\fs20}Ah!

1406
01:16:13,204 --> 01:16:15,001
{\fs20}Sorry. Yeah, I see now that an alligator

1407
01:16:15,072 --> 01:16:16,699
{\fs20}wouldn't be in that context.

1408
01:16:22,747 --> 01:16:27,150
{\fs20}"Some hotels try to make it seem
as much like home as possible."

1409
01:16:28,986 --> 01:16:30,954
{\fs20}"But they're missing the point."

1410
01:16:35,693 --> 01:16:39,356
{\fs20}"If you wanted to stay in a place
like home, then why not stay at home?"

1411
01:16:43,634 --> 01:16:47,161
{\fs20}"Our guests should experience
an escape from the everyday."

1412
01:16:52,076 --> 01:16:56,410
{\fs20}"And that's what I'd like
to capture in our new hotel."

1413
01:17:00,952 --> 01:17:05,514
{\fs20}"What every kid knows and what
every adult has forgotten."

1414
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:15,165
{\fs20}"Like my father said to me,

1415
01:17:15,233 --> 01:17:19,670
{\fs20}your fun is only limited
by your imagination."

1416
01:17:22,707 --> 01:17:25,574
{\fs20}- That was beautiful.
- Yeah? All right. Settle down.

1417
01:17:25,643 --> 01:17:27,076
{\fs20}Just the way it built.

1418
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:31,080
{\fs20}And that's it? I'm sorry.
I don't understand it.

1419
01:17:33,384 --> 01:17:36,615
{\fs20}That... was... brilliant!

1420
01:17:36,687 --> 01:17:39,918
{\fs20}Congratulations, my boy. You've
just won the keys to the kingdom.

1421
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:56,501
{\fs20}Boogie, don't do that. Germs.

1422
01:17:59,143 --> 01:18:01,941
{\fs20}Congratulations. Great
job. Keep icing that tongue.

1423
01:18:02,013 --> 01:18:04,447
{\fs20}- All right.
- Congratulations, Skeeter.

1424
01:18:04,515 --> 01:18:06,449
{\fs20}- Congratulations. That was great.
- Yeah?

1425
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,050
{\fs20}That's just terrific.

1426
01:18:11,188 --> 01:18:12,553
{\fs20}Congratulations, Skeeter.

1427
01:18:12,623 --> 01:18:15,820
{\fs20}All right, Kendall. Yeah.
No hard feelings, pal.

1428
01:18:15,893 --> 01:18:18,885
{\fs20}Of course not. You deserve it.
You're a better man than me.

1429
01:18:18,963 --> 01:18:21,431
{\fs20}- You have an iron will.
- Yeah. That's what they say.

1430
01:18:21,499 --> 01:18:24,991
{\fs20}I would not have the guts to tear down
the school my niece and nephew attend.

1431
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:27,037
{\fs20}What?

1432
01:18:28,472 --> 01:18:31,168
{\fs20}You do know that's the
site for the new hotel?

1433
01:18:31,242 --> 01:18:33,142
{\fs20}What are you talking about?

1434
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:35,440
{\fs20}- Good show, old son.
- Oh, sir.

1435
01:18:35,513 --> 01:18:39,711
{\fs20}That bee sting language was really
working for you on a sympathetic level.

1436
01:18:39,784 --> 01:18:42,412
{\fs20}Good, I'm glad. I wanted to
talk to you about the location

1437
01:18:42,486 --> 01:18:43,919
{\fs20}that we're building the hotel.

1438
01:18:43,988 --> 01:18:46,149
{\fs20}Happy birthday to you

1439
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:49,454
{\fs20}Happy birthday to you

1440
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:52,519
{\fs20}Happy birthday

1441
01:19:14,385 --> 01:19:17,548
{\fs20}Bronson, you're fired!

1442
01:19:18,923 --> 01:19:21,289
{\fs20}Fired?

1443
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:22,519
{\fs20}Oh...

1444
01:19:22,593 --> 01:19:24,618
{\fs20}That's how it connects.

1445
01:19:35,873 --> 01:19:36,897
{\fs20}Yes?

1446
01:19:36,974 --> 01:19:38,874
{\fs20}Do you know where Jill
Hastings' class is?

1447
01:19:38,943 --> 01:19:40,274
{\fs20}It's right over there.

1448
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:44,679
{\fs20}Why won't you answer my calls?

1449
01:19:44,749 --> 01:19:47,217
{\fs20}Because I know it's you calling.

1450
01:19:47,284 --> 01:19:49,548
{\fs20}You got to believe me,
Jill. I had no idea...

1451
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:54,080
{\fs20}Don't destroy the sliver of respect
I have for you by making lame excuses.

1452
01:19:55,426 --> 01:19:59,556
{\fs20}Just go away and stay away.

1453
01:20:01,632 --> 01:20:05,068
{\fs20}Uncle Skeeter? Do you want
to incinertate our school

1454
01:20:05,136 --> 01:20:07,934
{\fs20}'cause we incinertated you in the story?

1455
01:20:08,005 --> 01:20:10,269
{\fs20}No, I wouldn't do that.

1456
01:20:10,341 --> 01:20:13,139
{\fs20}We thought you were
supposed to be the good guy.

1457
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:28,422
{\fs20}So did I.

1458
01:20:47,711 --> 01:20:50,544
{\fs20}"Skeeto defeats Kendallo."

1459
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:53,850
{\fs20}Not really.

1460
01:20:53,918 --> 01:20:57,979
{\fs20}- Yeah?
- Hey.

1461
01:20:58,055 --> 01:21:00,956
{\fs20}Oh, hey. Welcome back.

1462
01:21:02,526 --> 01:21:04,255
{\fs20}So, you mad at me, too?

1463
01:21:04,328 --> 01:21:08,162
{\fs20}Not as mad as Jill, but, uh, mad, yes.

1464
01:21:08,232 --> 01:21:10,860
{\fs20}I didn't know the new
hotel was going up there.

1465
01:21:11,602 --> 01:21:12,762
{\fs20}I figured that.

1466
01:21:12,837 --> 01:21:13,929
{\fs20}Then what are you mad at?

1467
01:21:14,004 --> 01:21:15,528
{\fs20}I gave the kids junk food?

1468
01:21:15,606 --> 01:21:17,801
{\fs20}No, I figured you'd do that too.

1469
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:21,003
{\fs20}I'm mad because you told my kids

1470
01:21:21,078 --> 01:21:23,410
{\fs20}that in real life there
are no happy endings.

1471
01:21:23,481 --> 01:21:25,415
{\fs20}Well, look around you, Wendy.

1472
01:21:25,483 --> 01:21:27,610
{\fs20}Do you see any happy endings here?

1473
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:35,324
{\fs20}I don't know. You and Dad always
had so much fun in this room.

1474
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:37,053
{\fs20}For whatever reason, I didn't.

1475
01:21:37,127 --> 01:21:40,187
{\fs20}I was always the cynic,
the, the sourpuss.

1476
01:21:40,264 --> 01:21:43,062
{\fs20}The black cloud. The energy drainer.

1477
01:21:43,133 --> 01:21:45,260
{\fs20}The... dead fish.

1478
01:21:45,336 --> 01:21:47,964
{\fs20}Yes, all of those things.

1479
01:21:48,038 --> 01:21:50,063
{\fs20}But when I left Bobbi
and Patrick with you,

1480
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:53,268
{\fs20}I guess I just was hoping
you'd rub off on them.

1481
01:21:53,344 --> 01:21:57,542
{\fs20}Get them to be lighter.
Have fun. Enjoy themselves.

1482
01:21:58,616 --> 01:22:00,140
{\fs20}I thought Dad would like that.

1483
01:22:01,652 --> 01:22:04,849
{\fs20}Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona.

1484
01:22:04,922 --> 01:22:07,152
{\fs20}Teaching, not principaling.

1485
01:22:07,224 --> 01:22:08,691
{\fs20}That's cool.

1486
01:22:08,759 --> 01:22:11,853
{\fs20}Yeah, well, maybe you can
come visit when we get settled.

1487
01:22:11,929 --> 01:22:14,591
{\fs20}I know by then the kids
will really want to see you.

1488
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:22,705
{\fs20}All right. Love you.

1489
01:22:22,773 --> 01:22:24,104
{\fs20}Love you.

1490
01:22:28,879 --> 01:22:33,748
{\fs20}And so Skeeter sat on his
bed, filled with regret,

1491
01:22:33,817 --> 01:22:36,183
{\fs20}wondering how to put the
pieces of his life together

1492
01:22:36,253 --> 01:22:38,278
{\fs20}after one magical week.

1493
01:22:38,355 --> 01:22:42,052
{\fs20}- Great ending, huh?
- That was your ending, son?

1494
01:22:42,126 --> 01:22:45,357
{\fs20}I thought this was just a sad part,
and you were about to make it better.

1495
01:22:45,429 --> 01:22:47,260
{\fs20}What? How could I make it any better?

1496
01:22:47,331 --> 01:22:49,822
{\fs20}Well, In the stories I told you,

1497
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,731
{\fs20}just when things looked bleakest,

1498
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:55,363
{\fs20}the hero would do something
unexpected and courageous

1499
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:58,237
{\fs20}to beat the bad guy, save
the day, and get the girl!

1500
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,335
{\fs20}Yeah. How can I do that?

1501
01:23:01,412 --> 01:23:03,004
{\fs20}It's your story, not mine.

1502
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,207
{\fs20}But you better get
moving. Go get 'em, son.

1503
01:23:16,193 --> 01:23:18,354
{\fs20}Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham?

1504
01:23:18,429 --> 01:23:20,954
{\fs20}I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a moment.

1505
01:23:21,031 --> 01:23:24,228
{\fs20}My name is Jill Hastings. I'm
a teacher at Webster Elementary.

1506
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:27,828
{\fs20}Save our school! Save our school!

1507
01:23:27,905 --> 01:23:31,363
{\fs20}Save our school! Save our school!

1508
01:23:31,442 --> 01:23:33,137
{\fs20}Save our school!

1509
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,905
{\fs20}Save our school!

1510
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:38,073
{\fs20}My men are in position. We
are ready for the demolition.

1511
01:23:38,148 --> 01:23:40,309
{\fs20}Excellent. Mr. Nottingham said he'd call

1512
01:23:40,384 --> 01:23:42,477
{\fs20}if he had a problem
getting the variance,

1513
01:23:42,553 --> 01:23:45,113
{\fs20}so if we don't hear from
him in the next 20 minutes,

1514
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:47,214
{\fs20}I say we just... blow it all up.

1515
01:23:53,297 --> 01:23:56,824
{\fs20}Madam, the war is over.
You lost. I'm sorry.

1516
01:24:00,504 --> 01:24:03,735
{\fs20}This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham.
We're talking about children.

1517
01:24:03,807 --> 01:24:06,833
{\fs20}There must be other possible
sites for your hotel complex

1518
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:09,435
{\fs20}that would not result
in the displacement...

1519
01:24:09,513 --> 01:24:11,413
{\fs20}Hey, hey! Barry, Jill. How you doing?

1520
01:24:11,482 --> 01:24:14,383
{\fs20}We're just wrapping up here.
Donna, you remember Jill, right?

1521
01:24:14,451 --> 01:24:18,649
{\fs20}Of course! Oh, my God.
That jacket is so cute!

1522
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:21,555
{\fs20}Uh, thank you.

1523
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,115
{\fs20}Bronson, what are you doing here?

1524
01:24:23,193 --> 01:24:25,627
{\fs20}What am I doing here?
Yeah, what am I doing here?

1525
01:24:25,696 --> 01:24:29,530
{\fs20}Oh, uh, well, Mr. Bronson,
as a concerned citizen,

1526
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,329
{\fs20}wanted to bring points to my attention

1527
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:34,030
{\fs20}before I made any hasty
decisions about the property.

1528
01:24:34,104 --> 01:24:37,471
{\fs20}And they are points that are
going to take me years to analyze.

1529
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:39,702
{\fs20}- Years?
- Years.

1530
01:24:39,777 --> 01:24:43,304
{\fs20}Bronson, are you
playing hardball with me?

1531
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,745
{\fs20}I am, sir.

1532
01:24:44,815 --> 01:24:48,046
{\fs20}Because your application
for variance has been...

1533
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:51,149
{\fs20}Denied.

1534
01:24:52,723 --> 01:24:54,020
{\fs20}Denied?

1535
01:24:54,091 --> 01:24:55,956
{\fs20}Yes. But the good news is

1536
01:24:56,026 --> 01:24:58,460
{\fs20}Donna and I found you
another piece of property

1537
01:24:58,529 --> 01:25:02,397
{\fs20}right on the beach in Santa Monica
that is uptight and out of sight.

1538
01:25:02,466 --> 01:25:05,026
{\fs20}Beachfront was my first
choice, but it's not for sale.

1539
01:25:05,102 --> 01:25:06,569
{\fs20}It is now.

1540
01:25:06,637 --> 01:25:08,867
{\fs20}It is! Isn't that fabulous?

1541
01:25:09,373 --> 01:25:10,465
{\fs20}Really?

1542
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:11,974
{\fs20}Friends?

1543
01:25:12,042 --> 01:25:14,033
{\fs20}Oh, oh. Yeah, well, germs.

1544
01:25:14,111 --> 01:25:17,638
{\fs20}Let's get past that.
Come here. Come here.

1545
01:25:17,715 --> 01:25:21,082
{\fs20}No, no, no, no, no.

1546
01:25:21,151 --> 01:25:23,984
{\fs20}I'm touching you, and
it's OK. Look at that.

1547
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:26,147
{\fs20}Aw...

1548
01:25:26,223 --> 01:25:30,057
{\fs20}Ooh. You're enjoying it.
Good. Bring me closer.

1549
01:25:30,127 --> 01:25:33,824
{\fs20}That is so sweet. And creepy.

1550
01:25:36,967 --> 01:25:39,026
{\fs20}Attention, please, ladies and gentlemen.

1551
01:25:39,103 --> 01:25:43,472
{\fs20}We are working with highly-sensitive,
dangerous radio-controlled explosives.

1552
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,269
{\fs20}Boo!

1553
01:25:45,342 --> 01:25:49,278
{\fs20}And so to avoid any tragic misfires,

1554
01:25:49,346 --> 01:25:51,814
{\fs20}I would ask that you all
turn off your cell phones.

1555
01:25:51,882 --> 01:25:55,113
{\fs20}All of you, please. Turn
your cell phones off.

1556
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,779
{\fs20}Did you really just fix everything?

1557
01:25:58,856 --> 01:26:00,790
{\fs20}Not everything.

1558
01:26:04,328 --> 01:26:06,523
{\fs20}- Yes?
- We appear to have a situation.

1559
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:08,565
{\fs20}I can't reach Kendall on his cell phone

1560
01:26:08,632 --> 01:26:12,432
{\fs20}to halt the demolition which
will begin in... 13 minutes.

1561
01:26:12,503 --> 01:26:14,403
{\fs20}This sign we made is awesome!

1562
01:26:14,471 --> 01:26:17,531
{\fs20}We need a window where those
construction guys can see it.

1563
01:26:17,608 --> 01:26:19,473
{\fs20}Then they'll change their minds.

1564
01:26:21,044 --> 01:26:22,705
{\fs20}Bobbi, I found one.

1565
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:28,815
{\fs20}That's my Prius!

1566
01:26:28,886 --> 01:26:30,683
{\fs20}- OK. Where's your truck?
- My truck?

1567
01:26:30,754 --> 01:26:32,813
{\fs20}I had to give it back to the hotel.

1568
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:35,484
{\fs20}What do you mean you
gave it back to the hotel?

1569
01:26:35,559 --> 01:26:36,890
{\fs20}Come here! Come here!

1570
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,292
{\fs20}Sorry!

1571
01:26:40,731 --> 01:26:42,596
{\fs20}It's for a good cause!

1572
01:26:45,435 --> 01:26:47,767
{\fs20}Have you ever driven a motorcycle?

1573
01:26:47,838 --> 01:26:49,169
{\fs20}No!

1574
01:27:20,337 --> 01:27:22,032
{\fs20}Oh, my God!

1575
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:27,643
{\fs20}No, no, no, no!

1576
01:27:32,616 --> 01:27:34,208
{\fs20}Ooh! Yah! Booya!

1577
01:27:45,128 --> 01:27:48,359
{\fs20}Have you seen Bobbi? Patrick?

1578
01:27:48,432 --> 01:27:50,798
{\fs20}Bobbi! Patrick!

1579
01:27:52,836 --> 01:27:54,565
{\fs20}What are you going to do?

1580
01:28:13,557 --> 01:28:15,252
{\fs20}I'll take that back.

1581
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,085
{\fs20}No fair!

1582
01:28:19,162 --> 01:28:22,598
{\fs20}Hey, people, that's
60 seconds! Whoo-hoo!

1583
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:25,567
{\fs20}Wait! Wait a minute! I
can't find my children!

1584
01:28:25,636 --> 01:28:27,763
{\fs20}- They might be in there!
- Nice try.

1585
01:28:27,838 --> 01:28:30,671
{\fs20}We cleared the building hours
ago. OK? Everything is fine.

1586
01:28:32,976 --> 01:28:34,773
{\fs20}No! Let me through!

1587
01:28:34,845 --> 01:28:37,837
{\fs20}Hey, we got to check the rooms
before we start making booms.

1588
01:28:37,915 --> 01:28:39,712
{\fs20}We've checked it already!

1589
01:28:39,783 --> 01:28:41,011
{\fs20}Do it myself.

1590
01:28:42,419 --> 01:28:45,081
{\fs20}Uncle Skeeter!

1591
01:28:45,155 --> 01:28:47,623
{\fs20}Hey! Get out of there!

1592
01:28:47,691 --> 01:28:49,090
{\fs20}- Five...
- No!

1593
01:28:49,159 --> 01:28:50,683
{\fs20}- Grab the bar!
- Four...

1594
01:28:51,929 --> 01:28:53,897
{\fs20}Three...

1595
01:28:54,531 --> 01:28:56,123
{\fs20}Two...

1596
01:28:56,199 --> 01:28:57,188
{\fs20}One!

1597
01:29:03,941 --> 01:29:06,876
{\fs20}The king has issued a proclamation.

1598
01:29:07,878 --> 01:29:09,971
{\fs20}The hotel moves away.

1599
01:29:10,047 --> 01:29:12,447
{\fs20}The school will stay.

1600
01:29:12,516 --> 01:29:14,746
{\fs20}Long live Webster Elementary!

1601
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:21,250
{\fs20}- Mom!
- Mom!

1602
01:29:21,325 --> 01:29:22,883
{\fs20}Bobbi! Patrick!

1603
01:29:24,161 --> 01:29:25,355
{\fs20}Oh!

1604
01:29:27,864 --> 01:29:31,664
{\fs20}Hey, hey, hey. You
guys underdemeciated me.

1605
01:29:31,735 --> 01:29:34,363
{\fs20}Come here! I just got to know you guys.

1606
01:29:34,438 --> 01:29:36,906
{\fs20}You think I'm gonna let
you slip away from me now?

1607
01:29:36,974 --> 01:29:39,602
{\fs20}I knew you were the good guy.

1608
01:29:39,676 --> 01:29:41,075
{\fs20}Yeah.

1609
01:29:41,144 --> 01:29:45,171
{\fs20}Uh, Patrick, hi. I'm Trisha Sparks.

1610
01:29:45,248 --> 01:29:48,547
{\fs20}I just wanted you to know that...
thanks for saving the school.

1611
01:29:50,587 --> 01:29:52,282
{\fs20}Western. Go Western.

1612
01:29:52,356 --> 01:29:57,020
{\fs20}- No thanks necessary, ma'am.
- That's my boy. That's my boy.

1613
01:29:57,094 --> 01:30:01,190
{\fs20}There must be some way for
me to show my appreciation.

1614
01:30:01,264 --> 01:30:06,964
{\fs20}Oh-ho-ho!
Get it.

1615
01:30:08,105 --> 01:30:12,098
{\fs20}Ooh!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1616
01:30:12,175 --> 01:30:13,836
{\fs20}Hey, isn't she a little old for you?

1617
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,879
{\fs20}- She's hot.
- So is she. What do you think?

1618
01:30:16,947 --> 01:30:18,744
{\fs20}If Master Stinky's getting a kiss,

1619
01:30:18,815 --> 01:30:21,943
{\fs20}shouldn't, shouldn't I get
a little mermaid action?

1620
01:30:22,019 --> 01:30:24,078
{\fs20}- Come on, already.
- Ooh!

1621
01:30:38,435 --> 01:30:41,029
{\fs20}Now look what my boy has done.

1622
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:43,937
{\fs20}Turned his back on the world
of luxury hotel management

1623
01:30:44,007 --> 01:30:46,999
{\fs20}to start a small family business.

1624
01:30:47,077 --> 01:30:51,241
{\fs20}And bless his heart, he
even named it after me.

1625
01:30:51,314 --> 01:30:54,613
{\fs20}Hey, speaking of s'mores, it
looks like Bugsy ate them all.

1626
01:30:56,653 --> 01:30:58,518
{\fs20}We're completely out of marshmallows.

1627
01:30:58,588 --> 01:31:01,955
{\fs20}Oh, all right. Let me
handle that. Room service!

1628
01:31:04,061 --> 01:31:06,086
{\fs20}- Yes, sir?
- Hi, Kendall.

1629
01:31:06,163 --> 01:31:07,687
{\fs20}Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows.

1630
01:31:07,764 --> 01:31:10,324
{\fs20}If you could just go get him
some, that would be great.

1631
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,992
{\fs20}Right on it, sir. Anything else?

1632
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:14,162
{\fs20}Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh...

1633
01:31:14,237 --> 01:31:15,898
{\fs20}...Housekeeping?

1634
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,867
{\fs20}Hey, Aspen.

1635
01:31:18,942 --> 01:31:21,308
{\fs20}Could you just make sure
that Bugsy's cage is clean

1636
01:31:21,378 --> 01:31:22,970
{\fs20}before he checks out in the morning?

1637
01:31:23,046 --> 01:31:25,913
{\fs20}His marshmallows don't agree
with him, there's gonna be a mess.

1638
01:31:29,486 --> 01:31:30,748
{\fs20}All right.

1639
01:31:32,255 --> 01:31:33,586
{\fs20}OK, bye, guys.

1640
01:31:33,657 --> 01:31:35,989
{\fs20}I think Bugsy is trying to tell us

1641
01:31:36,059 --> 01:31:38,027
{\fs20}that our tale has reached its end.

1642
01:31:38,095 --> 01:31:39,824
{\fs20}But before I go, let me tell you

1643
01:31:39,896 --> 01:31:42,296
{\fs20}what our heroes and
villains are doing now.

1644
01:31:42,365 --> 01:31:44,265
{\fs20}My old friend, Barry Nottingham,

1645
01:31:44,334 --> 01:31:46,894
{\fs20}overcame his fear of
germs to such a degree

1646
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:49,302
{\fs20}that he decided to
leave the hotel business

1647
01:31:49,372 --> 01:31:51,966
{\fs20}and enter the field of medicine.

1648
01:31:52,042 --> 01:31:56,342
{\fs20}He is currently the school
nurse at Webster Elementary.

1649
01:31:56,413 --> 01:31:58,677
{\fs20}Violet now runs the hotel empire,

1650
01:31:58,748 --> 01:32:01,148
{\fs20}along with her husband, Mickey,

1651
01:32:01,218 --> 01:32:03,277
{\fs20}the former room service waiter

1652
01:32:03,353 --> 01:32:06,186
{\fs20}who is now the ninth-richest
person in the world.

1653
01:32:07,324 --> 01:32:09,258
{\fs20}And Skeeter and Jill?

1654
01:32:09,326 --> 01:32:12,762
{\fs20}After the double wedding of the century,

1655
01:32:12,829 --> 01:32:17,459
{\fs20}they lived... well, happily ever after,

1656
01:32:17,534 --> 01:32:19,297
{\fs20}running Marty's Motel

1657
01:32:19,369 --> 01:32:22,600
{\fs20}and spending a lot of
time with my grandkids,

1658
01:32:22,672 --> 01:32:25,436
{\fs20}whose adventures have just begun.

1659
01:32:25,509 --> 01:32:29,536
{\fs20}Though, not everyone
is quite so excited.

1660
01:32:29,613 --> 01:32:32,411
{\fs20}But that is a whole other story.

1661
01:32:32,482 --> 01:32:34,279
{\fs20}The end.

1662
01:32:36,753 --> 01:32:38,983
{\fs20}Don't stop believing

1663
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:43,418
{\fs20}Hold on to that feeling

1664
01:32:43,493 --> 01:32:46,758
{\fs20}Streetlight people

1665
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:51,426
{\fs20}Oh-oh-whoa

1666
01:32:51,501 --> 01:32:55,369
{\fs20}Don't stop believing

1667
01:32:55,438 --> 01:32:58,930
{\fs20}Hold on

1668
01:32:59,009 --> 01:33:02,604
{\fs20}Streetlight people

1669
01:33:02,679 --> 01:33:07,275
{\fs20}Oh-oh-whoa

1670
01:33:25,202 --> 01:33:27,432
{\fs20}Just a small town girl

1671
01:33:28,738 --> 01:33:31,935
{\fs20}Livin' in a lonely world

1672
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:35,202
{\fs20}She took the midnight train

1673
01:33:35,278 --> 01:33:38,714
{\fs20}Goin' anywhere

1674
01:33:41,318 --> 01:33:43,912
{\fs20}Just a city boy

1675
01:33:45,422 --> 01:33:48,357
{\fs20}Born and raised in south Detroit

1676
01:33:49,659 --> 01:33:51,559
{\fs20}He took the midnight train

1677
01:33:51,628 --> 01:33:55,564
{\fs20}Goin' anywhere

1678
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:16,347
{\fs20}A singer in a smoky room

1679
01:34:17,854 --> 01:34:21,346
{\fs20}A smell of wine and cheap perfume

1680
01:34:21,424 --> 01:34:24,257
{\fs20}For a smile they can share the night

1681
01:34:24,327 --> 01:34:28,787
{\fs20}It goes on and on and on and on

1682
01:34:28,865 --> 01:34:32,961
{\fs20}Strangers waiting

1683
01:34:34,037 --> 01:34:36,505
{\fs20}Up and down the boulevard

1684
01:34:36,573 --> 01:34:38,905
{\fs20}Their shadows

1685
01:34:38,975 --> 01:34:43,241
{\fs20}Searching in the night

1686
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:48,945
{\fs20}Streetlight people

1687
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:53,253
{\fs20}Living just to find emotion

1688
01:34:53,323 --> 01:34:54,984
{\fs20}Hiding

1689
01:34:55,058 --> 01:34:59,825
{\fs20}Somewhere in the night

1690
01:35:09,873 --> 01:35:12,865
{\fs20}Working hard to get my fill

1691
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:17,744
{\fs20}Everybody wants a thrill

1692
01:35:17,814 --> 01:35:20,806
{\fs20}Paying anything to roll the dice

1693
01:35:20,884 --> 01:35:24,684
{\fs20}Just one more time

1694
01:35:25,689 --> 01:35:27,418
{\fs20}Some will win

1695
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:29,720
{\fs20}Some will lose

1696
01:35:29,793 --> 01:35:33,388
{\fs20}Some were born to sing the blues

1697
01:35:33,463 --> 01:35:36,432
{\fs20}Oh the movie never ends

1698
01:35:36,499 --> 01:35:40,902
{\fs20}It goes on and on and on and on

1699
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:44,872
{\fs20}Strangers waiting

1700
01:35:46,076 --> 01:35:48,567
{\fs20}Up and down the boulevard

1701
01:35:48,645 --> 01:35:50,806
{\fs20}Their shadows

1702
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,249
{\fs20}Searching in the night

1703
01:35:57,087 --> 01:36:00,750
{\fs20}Streetlight people

1704
01:36:02,092 --> 01:36:05,027
{\fs20}Living just to find emotion

1705
01:36:05,095 --> 01:36:07,120
{\fs20}Hiding

1706
01:36:07,197 --> 01:36:12,157
{\fs20}Somewhere in the night

1707
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:32,846
{\fs20}Don't stop believing

1708
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:37,059
{\fs20}Hold on to that feeling

1709
01:36:37,127 --> 01:36:40,563
{\fs20}Streetlight people

1710
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:44,999
{\fs20}Oh-oh-whoa

1711
01:36:45,068 --> 01:36:48,560
{\fs20}Don't stop believing

1712
01:36:49,506 --> 01:36:52,907
{\fs20}Hold on

1713
01:36:52,976 --> 01:36:56,377
{\fs20}Streetlight people

1714
01:36:56,446 --> 01:37:00,177
{\fs20}Oh-oh-whoa
