that which is

a rush in my blood.

87
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,916
The siege itself was
almost as bad as
the assaults,

88
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,439
and the assaults
were out of this world.

89
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,398
They kept coming at us,
wave after wave.

Totally
indifferent
to casualties.

91
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,914
Of course,
the Chinese always had
plenty of bodies to spare.

92
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,194
They seemed
to be fascinated
with our Springfield 1903.

93
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,996
The rifle
our snipers used.

94
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,672
They called it "the weapon
of the silent death."

95
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,878
I wish
I could remember
that phrase in Chinese.

96
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,190
Actually,
it was rather beautiful.

97
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,308
In battle, sir,
how do you keep
from being scared?

98
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,037
You don't.
My God, was I scared!

99
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,233
I must have lost about
20 pounds, all of it brown!

100
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,599
But fear has a way of
providing you with
a little bonus.

101
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,958
It gives you

102
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,359
"the wolf."

103
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,348
"The wolf?"

104
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,873
It's a quotation from
Theodore Roosevelt.
Let me see.

105

"All men who
have felt the power

the wolf rises in the heart."

107
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,511

I know that man was
meant to be a warrior.

110
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,993

the appearances.

111
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,992
Otherwise I'll get
an earache from
Mrs. Malloy.

112
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,957
It's delicious, sir.

113
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,513
I don't imagine
I had much appetite

114
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,875
when I was
appointed cadet major.

115
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,032
My God.
Can't be 45 years ago.

116
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,319
Nobody's that old.

117
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,595
Wasn't General Black
the commander then, sir?

118
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,237
General Black?
Yes. Yes, General Black.

119
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,711
We cadets used to say that
his name described his heart.

120
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,435
But we respected
the hell out of him,
I can tell you that.

121
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,078
He went the whole
nine yards.

122
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,912
It didn't matter
whether it was war

123
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,912
or growing roses
or making men.

124
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,594
You know
that picture of him that
hangs in the admin building?

125
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,239
When I was a plebe,
that used to scare me,

126
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,799
just walking
under that picture.

127
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,949
That's why
they hung it there.

128
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,155
(ALL LAUGH)

129
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,038
The truth is, I think,
you would have loved
him like a father.

130
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,189
I know I did.

131
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,555
And speaking of fathers,
Mr. Moreland,

132
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,790
is your dad still at
Fort Benning?

133
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,155
No, sir,
he's at Fort Polk now.

134
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,038
Well, a good top sergeant
is worth his weight in gold.

135
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,955
I know many a colonel who's
had his ass saved by
a clever sergeant.

136
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,474
Excuse me, Mrs. Malloy.

137
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,474
I'm sure
he's very proud of you, son.

138
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,068
I hope he is, sir.
Thank you.

139
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,031
My doctor allows me
one of these a day.
This is my third.

140
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,752
I wish
I could tell you

141
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,515
that there are more old
generals than old doctors,
but I'm afraid it's not true.

142
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,237
Mrs. Malloy, my officers and I
will have coffee and brandy in
the study.

143
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,639
Gentlemen?

144
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,231
I'm afraid I can't
vouch for the vintage,

145
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,074
but ultimately
it is the company
that counts, isn't it?

146
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,192
So, what shall we drink to?

147
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,472
I tell you what.
Let's drink to the one
thing that never changes.

148
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,120
To the one permanent
part of a man's life.

149
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,588
What's that, sir?

150
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,039
Honor.

151
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,434
Honor, indeed.

152
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,070
Burglarproof, foolproof,
weatherproof. 100 proof.
Honor.

153
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,755
Everything else is
subject to
the powers that be,

154
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,353
dependent upon the caprices
of often inferior men.

155
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,029
But your honor is
your own, inviolate.

156
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,910
So, then.
To honor.

157
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,312
To honor.
To honor.

158
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,152
Drink up.
We have things to do.

159
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,995
Bunker Hill is
rich in ceremony,

160
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,629
but this is an occasion
I always like to keep
rather private,

161
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,748
when I say goodbye to
one major and appoint
another in his place.

162
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,951
The cadet major is outranked
militarily only by me,

163
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,918
so that
makes it a position
of some responsibility.

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,149
You'll attest to that,
won't you, Cooper?

165
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,878
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid I can.

166
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,238
Captain Moreland,
like your predecessor

167
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,515
you've distinguished yourself
for a number of years here
as an underclassman.

168
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,997
And in
recognition of your
scholarship and leadership,

169
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,674
your exemplary character,

170
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,829
I take pleasure
in conferring upon you
the rank of cadet major

171
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,111
with all
the responsibilities
and privileges of that rank.

172
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,432
Now, they'll
respect the rank.

173
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,034
But God knows,
they won't respect the man

174
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,792
unless he earns it.

175
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,678
And the loyalty of men

176
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,438
is always hard-earned.

177
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,709
I'll do my best, sir.

178
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,233
I have every
confidence in you.

179
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,548
Thank you, sir.

180
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,709
Congratulations, Brian.

181
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,392
Don't make me look
too bad in comparison.

182
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,674
Don't worry.

183
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,554
John, if you do half as well
at West Point as you've
done here,

184
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,914
you're going to
make a splendid officer.

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,434
Thank you, sir.
The credit would go to you.

186
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,711
If you
gentlemen wouldn't
mind accompanying me

187
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,836
as far as the
administration building,

188
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,950
I have my annual
battle of the paperclips
with the board of trustees.

189
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,152
Entirely adequate.

190
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,194
Listen, don't even ask me
what we had for dinner.
Can't remember.

191
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,510
We had this stuff...
We had brandy.

192
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,029
...that poured in
some green liquid.
Drank brandy with the general.

193
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,350
Incredible.
Do you even like brandy?

194
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,870
That's beside the point.
Can't stand it.

195
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,510
They're beautiful, roomie.
You earned them.

196
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,036
Yeah. You deserve
them as much as I do.

197
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,676
No way, José.
I'm half-civilian
on my mother's side.

198
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,832
Even if I did get you
through math, science,

199
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,355
military science...
True. True. Very true.

200
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,429
Did you get 'em?

201
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,472
Whatever happened to
good manners?

202
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,835
The simple custom
of knocking...

203
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,274
The gold. I'd give my
right nut for those
oak leaves.

204
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,433
Does a major
live at this address?
Can I touch 'em? Please?

205
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,152
Man, I can't believe it!

206
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,952
Don't cream on 'em.
They'll tarnish.

207
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,109
Listen, West,
you should've been there.

208
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,509
We talked about battles
that he'd been in.

209
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,352
No shit!
Drank brandy.

210
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,953
No shit!
Toasted honor.

211
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,713
Brandy and everything, you can
tell your grandchildren
about it.

212
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,950
Listen. We are gonna
have such a great year.

213
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,399
It's gonna be
the best year yet.

214
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,029
We are gonna
command the best regiment
this school has ever seen.

215
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,189
Damn well said!

216
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,636
In honor of this
auspicious occasion,
Major Moreland,

217
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,912
your presence is
requested in the hallway.

218
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,309
Dismissed!

219
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,949
ALL: Major Moreland,
he's our man

220
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,349
Major Moreland,
he's our man

221
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,149
He's the baddest in the land

222
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,789
Thank you, Dave.
Thank you. Thanks.

223
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,557
That was a nice thing
to do, Shawn. I mean it.

224
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,959
Thanks.

225
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,478
(MARCHING MUSIC)

226
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,790
ANNOUNCER: The corps of
cadets is commanded by
Major John Cooper.

227
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,677
(APPLAUSE)

228
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,352
The incoming
corps commander is
Major Brian Moreland.

229
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,431
(APPLAUSE)

230
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,469
B Company is led by
Cadet Captain David Shawn.

231
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,516
Eyes right!

232
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,953
Eyes right!

233
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,114
A Company is led by
Cadet Captain JC Pierce.

234
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,511
Company, turn!

235
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,958
C Company is led by
Cadet Captain Robert Harris.

236
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,835
Eyes right!

237
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,355
D Troop is led by
Cadet Captain...

238
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,112
Eyes right!
...Alex Dwyer.

239
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,075
Present arms!

240
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,394
Staff, present arms.

241
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,394
(GUNSHOT)

242
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,438
Stand at ease!

243
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,228
Staff, stand at ease.

244
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,069
Ladies and gentlemen,

245
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,076
for 141 years,
old soldiers like myself
have stood here on this day

246
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,277
and told the finest
of America's young men

247
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,557
the meaning of the word
"commencement. "

248
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,077
It is a beginning,
we told them.

249
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,313
But today,

250
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,590
this day,

251
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,109
it has another meaning,
an end.

252
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,796
An end
to nearly a century
and a half of tradition

253
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,315
and an end
to the heart of us.

254
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,232
I have been informed that
Bunker Hill Academy is
to be closed,

255
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,231
all of its
buildings torn down,
nothing to be left,

256
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,793
but memories.

257
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,633
It is the decision of
the board of trustees
in all their wisdom

258
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,110
that this institution be sold

259
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,957
and the land developed
for its real estate potential.

260
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,634
In order to allow the
incoming seniors to
graduate

261
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,713
and the underclassmen
to seek enrollment elsewhere,

262
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,958
the board has
graciously extended

263
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,878
the date of
termination for one year.

264
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,312
One year.

265
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,435
I stand here today with you

266
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,473
and look out
over these young men

267
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,833
and, of course, I am reminded
of other commencement days
and other young men,

268
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,035
men of courage and conviction,

269
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,477
men who have given everything.

270
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,356
In Mexico. In the great
catastrophe of the Civil War.

271
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,316
In Flanders and the Argonne.

272
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,036
In the jungles
of the Philippines
and on Omaha Beach.

273
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,239
In the snows of Bastogne,
in the Mekong Delta

274
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,473
and at the siege of Khe Sanh.

275
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,389
How, then,
can others say
this land is for sale?

276
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,348
It has been
purchased and paid for

277
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,555
with the blood
of our graduates.

278
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,876
I am a veteran of
many terrible battles.

279
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,630
But no battle is more
important than this one,

280
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,917
and this final battle,
I intend to win.

281
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,478
We have a year.

282
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,755
Entire wars have
been won in less time.

283
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,157
Men of the corps,
so long as breath
and spirit remain,

284
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,030
we must fight to
preserve this academy

285
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,149
so that the traditions
that were born here
may endure here.

286
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,671
We must
pledge ourselves
to that mission.

287
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,710
BACHE: Yes, come in.

288
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,308
Sir. Major Moreland, sir,
requesting permission
to speak.

289
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,233
Go ahead, Major.

290
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,198
Sir, those of us staying
summer session were
wondering...

291
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,633
We wondered if...

292
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,469
Stand at ease, Major.

293
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,392
Sir, how can they do this?

294
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,675
With the stroke of a pen, sir.

295
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,479
Their field of honor
was a desk top.

296
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,198
They didn't consult me.

297
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,036
Never even hinted at
what their plans were.

298
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,671
They just
papered it and penciled it
and they went ahead and did it

299
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,115
because that's
what the numbers said.

300
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,991
Sir, all they want is money.
Let them raise the tuition.
We'll pay it.

301
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,635
I'm afraid it's not
quite that simple, son.

302
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,590
There's a feeling
on the outside that

303
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,839
schools like this
are anachronistic

304
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,233
and leaders of men
like you and me
are dinosaurs.

305
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,068
Sir?

306
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,714
Well, you go to the movies,
you read books.

307
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,555
A military leader is always
portrayed as slightly insane.

308
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,237
Very often
more than slightly.

309
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,400
That's because
it is insane to

310
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,359

311

held in contempt.

I really deserve the
rank of major.

313
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,714

for myself.

314

the others or the school...

315

Sit down, Mr. Moreland.
Sir.

316

Never be ashamed of
being human.

Without humanity,
a leader becomes
a tyrant.

318
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,795
I was relieved, sir.
I figured I had
another year.

319
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,792
I could graduate
and go on to West Point.

320

those 12 years,

all my life.

younger than myself

little white shirts
with cut-off sleeves,

330

their days

makes me want to puke.

They like it like that,
civilians.

335
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,992
Well, the one thing
civilians know is
their rights.

336
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,153

within their rights to
push us out to make way

going to let them

Sure.

346
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,719
I did. I figured after one
whole year of being shit on,

347
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,558
I'd get hit by
a bus or something

348
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,074
and never get a chance
to shit on the next bunch.

349
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,357
So you didn't get
hit by a bus.
So what?

It'll be
another year
of getting shit on.

Will your folks let you
come back here for just
one year?

M-16s, ten full racks.

465
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,633
All right,
that's 20 to a rack.

466
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,272
200 M-16s.

467
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,833
45mm automatics, model 191 1,
four racks, 24 to a rack.

468
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,432
Six crates of
M-16 bayonets.

469
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,473
Six 81 mm mortars.

470
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,951
Jesus Christ! Bache has
enough armament here to
start World War III.

471
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,519
So glad they're going.

472
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,119
I didn't want them
here in the first place.

473
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,314
That was
the general's notion of
national defense, stock...

474
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,438
How did you
get in here?

475
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,312
The door was open.

476
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,117
Wonderful.

477
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,833
What do you say we lock it?

478
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,029
What's going on?
What's going on?

479
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,394
We're taking inventory.

480
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,040
Apparently,
we're no longer to
be trusted with weapons.

481
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,991
What are we gonna
drill with this summer?

482
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,150
After last night?
That was an accident, sir.

483
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,471
That's not
for you to decide and
I don't care to discuss it.

484
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,319
Look, I came to
ask about the general.

485
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,391
He's in intensive care.
How is he?

486
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,797
They say
the next 24 hours
will be the critical stage.

487
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,269
General's a strong man.
He'll be all right.

488
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,470
I'm only telling
you what they told me.
You can ask for yourself.

489
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,915
I did. I called the hospital.
They wouldn't let me talk
to him.

490
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,393
All right, then you
know as much as I do.

491
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,839
Well, who...

492
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,599
Who's gonna be in charge
of the summer session?

493
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,194
I'm not sure
there'll be a summer session.

494
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,195
What?

495
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,952
Goodbye, Mr. Moreland.

496
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,315
TV: They're worthwhile only
if there is a reasonable
chance for success.

497
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,994
Let me, ask you.
How much time has
elapsed since...

498
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,196
18 hours
and 12 minutes.

499
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,838
Dr McCoy
must have told you...

500
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,433
Why doesn't
the man use his phaser?

501
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,589
He can't.

502
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,749
How come?

503
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,836
The brain's protected
by an electromagnetic shield

504
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,399
which is phaser-proof

505
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,708
You seen this one before?

506
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,279
I've seen all of them before.

507
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,874
Turn on the news, quick!

508
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,473
You're not
supposed to be here!

509
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,432
We're watching this!

510
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,272
(SHOUTS OF PROTEST)

511
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,115
Shut up!

512
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,437
...shattered overnight by
the still-unexplained shooting

513
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,078
of a local boy.

514
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,995
Donald Andrews,
17, of Foxhaven,
died late last night

515
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,469
as a result of
a gunshot wound...

516
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,318
God, the kid
bought it, huh?

517
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,436
...between local
boys and cadets.

518
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,799
The shot was allegedly fired
by General Harlan Bache,

519
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,678
superintendent
of the Bunker Hill
Military Academy.

520
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,117
In response
to the tragedy,

521
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,952
police have
ordered all weapons

522
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,395
on academy grounds
to be confiscated.

523
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,789
What are we
supposed to
train with?

524
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,956
...maintained an armory
on the school grounds,

525
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,430
which cadets have used
for training purposes.

526
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,878
Meanwhile, General Bache
lies in very critical
condition

527
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,951
at Valley Community Hospital,

528
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,508
suffering from a heart attack
which occurred immediately

529
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,353
following the tragic
events at the school.

530
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,353
The school itself,
which had planned to
cease operations next June,

531
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,432
has been ordered
closed immediately
by its proprietors.

532
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,749
ALL: What?

533
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,798
Son of a bitch!

534
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,117
Anderson's father's
a big lawyer. Maybe he
can write something up.

535
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,673
Shovel, stop your goddamn
feeding your face, will you?

536
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,758
I'd like to grab a grenade
and ram it right up
their asses!

537
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,959
That's not fair.

538
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,639
Stop feeding! They
don't even give a shit!

539
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,793
Leave me alone!

540
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,989
Hey!

541
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,356
Here's today's
closing figure.

542
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,835
The lady
said the proprietors
ordered the school closed.

543
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,953
Now, as I see it,
we are the proprietors.

544
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,873
What does that mean to us?

545
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,479
Get the door.

546
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,351
All right, now listen up.

547
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,234
Mr. Stewart?
Yes.

548
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,515
Captain Dwyer, sir,
Bunker Hill Academy.

549
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,875
What can I do for you?
Provision list, sir.

550
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,473
Why? I heard they
were closing the place.

551
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,516
That's affirmative, sir.
Mopping-up battalion
has to eat though.

552
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,999
It took 150 years
to build the place.

553
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,911
It's gonna take time to
put it to bed, as they say.

554
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,628
Usually they want me
to deliver the stuff myself.

555
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,392
SOP undergoing
change nowadays, sir,

556
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,794
because of all
the unpleasantness.

557
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,835
SOP?

558
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,035
Standard Operating
Procedure, sir.

559
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,076
Call the academy if
you'd like some
verification.

560
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,394
Oh, no. That's okay.
Thank you, sir. Let's go.

561
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,517
Come on, let's go. Move it!

What is this?

568
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,231
They were all right
here just hours ago.

569
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,834
I... I don't understand.

570
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,276
See those racks?
They were filled.

571
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,794
What's going on here, Dean?

572
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,637
Moreland?
Who is this boy?

573
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,590
He's the ranking cadet.
Moreland.

574
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,756
Do you have any
explanation for this?

575
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,671
My God, son. Where
are all the weapons?

576
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,552
The weapons are secured, sir.

577
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,398
What do you mean secured?

578
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,959
You mean you stole them?

579
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,395
No, sir.
We confiscated them.

580
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,953
I don't believe this.
Dean, where's the phone?

581
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,433
There's one in the
office near the entrance.

582
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,715
I'll call the state police.
Afraid not, sir.
We've cut the lines.

583
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,835
Oh, my God.

584
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,315
Listen, kid, if you don't
turn those weapons over
immediately,

585
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,038
you're going to jail.
Now don't be an idiot.

The right to bear
arms is guaranteed in
the Constitution, sir.

587
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,559
You tell us where
you put those weapons

or this'll be the
sorriest day of
your life.

We have three demands.
They're very reasonable.

When they're met,
we'll be happy to
return every weapon,

checking the hood?

to be a real emergency
situation here.

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,752
Hey, JC, are you
catching that action?

having some problems?

I see 'em.
I see 'em!

Yeah, I'm talking to you!

624

Dwyer, for Christ's sake
hurry up!

625
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,273
Come on, let's go.
You guys having
a problem?

629
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,952
Dwyer, you better
get back in the truck.

The problem
is this asshole
just shot up the town.

better than nothing.

to be.

what I just saw out there.

00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,549
We didn't train
to go spastic at the
first sign of trouble.

Goddamn! I'm glad the
general didn't see that.

686
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,076
These cadets
will follow you
only if they respect you.

687
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,557
All right. Sit down.
At ease.

lose the truck?
It stalled down.

The townies had
Dwyer and me in
a hard place.

690
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,031
Shawn grabbed the chance
to use his shiny new weapon.

691
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,072
We were in
an explosive situation

692
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,718
which jeopardized
the entire mission.

693
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,677
I simply
defused the situation.

694
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,593
That's just beautiful.
You really have a way
with words.

695
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,592
He did get us out of it, Alex.

696
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,194
Dwyer, you'd still be
getting thrown around
by those townies

697
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,396
if he hadn't cut
loose a few live rounds.

698
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,397
Look, Alex, I don't like
the idea of gunplay either,

699
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,152
but the mission was successful
and nobody got hurt.

700
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,434
No, that's my whole point!

701
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,318
Now, I don't call
what happened today
a successful mission.

702
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,389
Naturally.

703
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,879
Look, we have to let
people know we're serious.

704
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,473
We just
also have to let them know
we don't want to hurt anyone.

705
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,879
All right, look,
what are we asking?

706
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,155
We're asking that the
school be kept open.
That's all.

707
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,869
Other kids are
vandalizing their school.
We want ours to stay open.

708
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,428
Now if we behave like soldiers
and not a bunch of kids in
a riot,

709
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,709
we can win this.

be done by the book.

711
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,194
Yeah, that's
all I'm asking.

712
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,637
It'll be done by the book.

the whole nine yards.

Lieutenant Hanson
of the state police.

717
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,348
Now before things get
out of hand,

718
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,954
put down your weapons
and open the gates.
You hear me?

719
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,392
We have conditions first.
Let's have an answer
on those.

720
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,399
You have illegally
seized private property.

721
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,232
Under the revisions
of the state penal code

722
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,117
you have
committed grand larceny.

723
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,589
You have also
threatened the life
of a federal officer.

724
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,035
Nobody's life was threatened.
Now what about those demands?

725
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,475
You have
fired upon citizens
and a deputy sheriff.

726
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,831
You boys are all in
very serious trouble.

727
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,911
Put down your weapons
or we'll take you in
by force.

728
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,228
What about the demands?

729
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,038
You have one minute
to comply.

730
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,549

00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,275
Pull it back!

740
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,632
Would you
describe the situation here
at Bunker Hill as stalemate?

741
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,312
I would not
call it a stalemate.

742
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,389
We're trying to ascertain

743
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,711
how many of the cadets
are actually rebellious
and how many are hostages.

744
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,638
We hadn't heard
there were any
hostages.

745
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,551
We have reason to
believe there are, sir.

746
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,792
Are the state police
prepared to use force to
bring the situation to an end?

747
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,833
We will protect
the lives and the property
of the people of the state.

748
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,076
If it means resorting...

749
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,113
Even if that means...

750
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,872
They won't interview us.

751
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,393
The police won't let 'em.

752
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,438
Why do I
get the feeling that
that guy would get pleasure

753
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,351
blowing our brains
all over his truck?

754
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,077
Do you see any
way out of this?

755
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,839
Depends on Bache.

756
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,870
I'm wondering
about that heart attack.

757
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,754
What if
General Bache never
even had a heart attack?

758
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,276
What if they're
just keeping him from us?

759
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,672
Why would they do that?

760
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,875
I don't know. To rattle us.

761
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,757
Make more of the whole
thing than we ever wanted.

Battalion dismissed!

775
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,471
Yaw!
(ALL CHEER)

776
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,637
This is Major Moreland.
Over.

777
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,393
This is Sergeant Briggs.
Yes, sir.

778
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,758
I have a delegation here
that wants to meet with you.

779
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,752
You tell the board we'll
be honored to meet
with them.

780
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,671
It's a delegation
of parents.

781
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,989
Parents?
Six of them.

782
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,038
The man in charge is
Master Sergeant
Kevin Moreland.

783
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,073
Will you talk to them?

784
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,029
Yes, sir.
Send them in
at 0930 hours.

785
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,519
Affirmative.

786
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,230
So it's your father.
So what?

787
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,959
Damn near everybody here
in this place has got
a mother or father

788
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,474
hanging around
outside that gate.

789
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,879
You don't.

790
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,269
Yeah, well,
I'm a hard case.

791
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,712
Sorry.
Forget it.

792
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,429
Look, at least
your old man has got
a nodding acquaintance

793
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,873
with the real world.

794
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,472
Hell, I like him.

795
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,629
Everybody
likes my old man.

796
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,039
You do too, Brian. Admit it.
That's why you're so scared.

797
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,838
No, I ain't scared.

798
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,029
I don't know if I like him.
I'm still thinking about it.

799
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,759
Yeah, well,
don't rush into anything.

800
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,476
When my mother died,

801
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,360
I was sitting
in the hallway in
the army hospital.

802
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,196
I was worried as hell.
'Cause I knew she was
real sick.

803
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,350
She had this
bad kidney thing.

804
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,468
So I'm sitting there
and my father comes
out of the room

805
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,274
and tells me
that she's dead.

806
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,113
He led me to
this little chapel
they had there in the hospital

807
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,988
and he sat me down and
he told me I could cry
for 15 minutes.

808
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,637
He gave me 15 minutes to cry
and after that I wasn't
supposed to cry again.

809
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,995
So he left me
alone in the chapel

810
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,876
and came back...
he came back 15 minutes later.

811
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,912
Jesus. What did you do?

812
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,713
Well, I did
what I was told.

813
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,834
I cried for 15 minutes.

814
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,509
She was a beautiful woman,

815
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,432
my mother.

816
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,154
She was crazy
about the old man.

817
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,192
I don't know,
I guess he loved her too.

818
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,588
You never
told me that story.

819
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,313
Yeah, I was 12.
That's when I came here.

820
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,514
(DOOR OPENS)
Brian.

821
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,831
Hey, Brian, they're down
at the gate. Better get going.

822
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,478
All right.

823
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,029
When this is over,
you and me are gonna
go round and round.

824
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,079
Yeah? But first you're
gonna move your goddamn arm.

825
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,239
Hello, Brian.

826
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,799
Hello, sir.

827
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,795
You look like you
might have grown
an inch or two.

828
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,477
You've put on
a couple of pounds too.

829
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,277
A couple.
Sorry you had to come
all the way up here, sir.

830
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,475
Nah.

831
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,040
How you doing, Alex?
Hello, Sergeant Moreland.

832
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,399
The old place looks
a little different...

833
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,078
Come on Moreland,
get to the bottom line.

834
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,559
Hold your water.

835
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,269
Bottom line.

836
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,798
The truth is,
Brian, these folks are
worried about their kids.

837
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,757
The poop back there said
some of them are being held

838
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,909
in here
against their will.

839
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,514
No, that's not true.
Everyone in here is here
because they want to be here.

840
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,273
I don't believe it. Our son
would not be involved in
something like this.

841
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,113
Lady, if my son
can be involved
in it,

842
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,758
your son
can be involved in it.

843
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,148
Let's not get
holier-than-thou.

844
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,390
Let us see
our children and
hear it from them.

845
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,515
Yes.

846
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,397
Ma'am, I can't call my
soldiers away from
their posts

847
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,232
just to calm down
their parents.
I'm sorry.

848
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,594
My God!
You're only children!

849
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,113
They're gonna
try to add kidnapping
to the rest of it, kid,

850
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,189
you oughta know that.

851
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,111
We want to see our kid.
I'll try to arrange something.

852
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,269
Good. Now, we're
getting somewhere.

853
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,588
It'll be done
under my terms.

854
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,278
I hope you're very
proud of your son,
Sergeant Moreland.

855
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,157
You have fathered
a perfect son of a bitch.

856
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,753
You people shut up!

857
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,116
I can't think through
all your static.

858
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,474
We aren't in the army,
Sergeant.

859
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,871
No apologies necessary.

860
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,509
Just keep the hell quiet
and let me take care
of this.

861
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,118
Frigging feather merchants.

862
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,119
I don't blame them, sir.
It's a little hard to
understand.

863
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,833
Ever get in the habit?

864
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,353
No, sir. No, thanks.

865
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,556
Smart.
Damn things
will kill you.

866
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,553
What am I gonna tell
those people outside?

867
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,313
Sorry, sir.
I never thought
this would involve you.

868
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,556
Let me tell 'em
it was growing pains.

869
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,830
The wrong execution
of the right idea.

870
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,077
The wrong execution
of the right idea?

871
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,430
Yeah. They'll
understand that.

872
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,350
Look, Brian, all the men in
our family have been soldiers.

873
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,032
I know.
Just plain old dogfaces

874
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,473
with a knack
for surviving.

875
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,714
I was hoping somebody
along the line would
break into brass.

876
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,915
I have my command, Dad.

877
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,035
I don't think
you're thinking straight.

878
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,317
What you have here
is a bad way to lose
a pretty bright future, kid.

879
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,032
Stop calling me kid.

880
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,636
You expect me
to call you Major?

881
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,478
You can forget it.

882
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,833
Look at this operation.

883
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,188
You got all your strength
nose to nose with the cops.

884
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,709
Eventually even those
bullhorn yo-yos are
gonna figure out

885
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,916
you've got a vulnerable rear
flank and they're gonna
sneak in there.

886
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,560
Maybe over there.
Over there, by the field,
behind the cover of the trees,

887
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,949
and they're
just gonna throw a net
over your little pink asses.

888
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,195
You can say all that...

889
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,679
The first canister
of tear gas,

890
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,399
half your troops
will wet their pants
and run like rabbits.

891
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,751
Or for that matter, how bright
was it to let this delegation
in here?

892
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,031
Look at me.
Within 5 seconds,
I could break your neck

893
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,758
and you wouldn't be
able to do a thing
about it.

894
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,996
You'd be shot. My next
in command would take over.

895
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,309
I read that book too.

896
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,073
On the other hand,
we could take you all
as hostages or prisoners,

897
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,639
but we won't.
We have a code of honor here.

898
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,076
Sweet Jesus! A code of honor.
Is that what this is
all about?

899
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,435
Somebody's lofty load
of shit about honor?
Yours?

900
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,353
Yes, mine,
and I learned it here.
General Bache lives it...

901
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,668
Bache?
Are you kidding me?

902
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,273
Bache is here because
there's no place...

903
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,759
He is the example
we all try to follow!

904
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,229
Bache has been passed over
so many times,

905
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,197
he's got a permanent
stiff neck from the draft.

906
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,554
I'll tell you about Bache!

907
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,313
Bache is living proof
that horses' asses
outnumber horses!

908
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,517
Captain Shawn, escort my...
the sergeant off the base!

909
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,113
Muster the men
in the quad.

910
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,838
Yes, sir.

911
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,916
We've pulled together
pretty well, haven't we?

912
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,228
ALL: Yes, sir!

913
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,036
General Bache
would be proud of us.

914
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,709
And if he were here,
I know he'd tell us
to hold out.

915
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,234
To finish what we've started
and not to be halfway about
anything.

916
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,119
But outside they're saying
that some of you are being
held against your will,

917
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,396
that you really
don't want to be here.

918
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,516
Now either they're
right or we're right.

919
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,989
Nobody's gonna cut you down if
you honestly don't believe in
what we're doing here,

920
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,229
or if you're afraid
of parents or the cops.

921
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,230
So anybody who
isn't 100 percent sure

922
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,754
of why we're here
and what we're doing,

923
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,838
take one step forward.

924
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,589
Battalion!

925
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,948
CAPTAINS: Company!

926
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,951
Attention!

927
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,113
Left!
Left!

928
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,311
Face!

929
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,391
Forward!
Forward!

930
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,549
March!

931
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,756
Major Moreland,
he's our man

932
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,950
Major Moreland, he's our man

933
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,153
Bunker Hill
we make our stand

934
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,231
Sound off
One, two

935
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,430
Sound off
Three, four

936
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,433
One, two, three, four

937
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,638
(RADIO PLAYING SLOW HAND
BY THE POINTER SISTERS)

938
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,678
Sir?
You got any grenades?

939
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,994
Thank you, sir.

940
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,318
You got any grenades?
Sure.

941
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,954
Can I have one?
Here you go.

942
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,076
Thanks.
Oh, and, Shovel?

943
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,833
Don't eat it.
Cute.

944
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,678
Carry on.
Thank you, sir.

945
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,359
Any news from the outside?
Ten-hut.

946
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,108
Carry on.
No news, sir.

947
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,034
His batteries are down, sir.
We can't even pick up the
shitkickers.

948
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,633
We can see them
from here, sir.

949
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,392
They're all
sitting with their
thumbs up their asses.

950
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,193
They don't scare us,
do they, Charlie?

951
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,789
No, sir.

952
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,155
Me either, sir.
They don't scare me.

953
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,234
Good night, guys.

954
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,759
BOTH: Good night, sir.

955
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,397
Charlie.

956
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,996
That's what I call
grace under pressure.

957
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,992
Why not?
Nero fiddled
while Rome burned.

958
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,435
That wasn't grace,
that was crazy.

959
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,676
It all depends on your
point of view, doesn't it?

960
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,672
That's Peru. Meaning?

961
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,558
Meaning maybe
this is just as crazy.

962
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,879
Alex, you've been picking at
this thing from the beginning.

963
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,116
What's wrong with you?

964
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,516
Things are going beautifully.
We're in better shape now
than we began.

965
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,953
Now we're a corps.

966
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,508
General Bache
used to talk about
men under pressure.

967
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,636
How they act as one.
Come together.
We're seeing it.

968
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,677
Thus spake Saint Bache.

969
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,113
Okay.
He's only a man, Brian.

970
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,556
Like your father,
like my father.
Just a man.

971
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,677
Not every word
out of his mouth
is some holy nugget.

972
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,273
Right. Whatever you say.

973
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,189
Look,
don't let that display
of loyalty go to your head.

974
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,111
It won't mean beans
to anybody out there.

975
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,714
They'll say it was
frustrated brainwashing.

976
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,833
Hell, maybe they're right.

977
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,598
I half expected you
to be the one to
break ranks.

978
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,272
Head for the
comforts of home.

979
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,713
The thought
crossed my mind.

980
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,319
What stopped you?

981
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,630
My sense of honor may be
a little ragged around
the edges,

982
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,631
but I don't
walk out on a friend.

983
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,788
If you want
to argue about this,
we'll argue in the morning.

984
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,440
I've got to
get some sleep.

985
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,831
All right.
It can wait
till morning.

986
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,873
What do you think they put
in those flak jackets?
Is it lead or what?

987
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,438
No. Lead's too heavy.
They wouldn't be
able to move.

988
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,239
They probably use
some sort of super-plastic.

989
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,909
I read that it's
got something to do
with the configuration...

990
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,110
Hey, wanna try and
spell that, bonehead?

991
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,237
He couldn't even
spell his own name.

992
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,033
What are you laughing at?
Keep it down.

993
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,031
(VEHICLES APPROACHING)

994
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,428
Shit. Down. Berets off.

995
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,310
Forward
observation
to command post.

996
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,231
Convoy approaching.
Looks like heavy stuff.

997
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,709
Have C Squad
cover the rooftops.

998
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:05,119
C Squad,
rear of the building!
A Squad, behind the trees!

999
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,112
How's it going, Brian?
They had to call in
the heavyweights.

1000
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,949
Can I get more
power on the rooftops.

1001
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,155
I already have, sir.

1002
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,673
Then reinforce the
rear and left flanks.

1003
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,749
Yes, sir.

1004
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,796
No one fires unless
I give the order,
understood?

1005
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,199
CADETS: Yes, sir.

1006
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:21,068
Man, this is too much!
There must be 100 trucks
coming in here.

1007
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,354
Don't sweat it.

1008
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,990
WOMAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
Stephen Miller?

1009
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,238
Stephen Miller?

1010
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,718
It's Mom, honey.

1011
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,551
Will you listen to me, please?

1012
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:01,716
It's still not too
late to come out of there
and forget it ever happened.

1013
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,275
We have such a wonderful
summer planned for you.

1014
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,639
Don't go and get involved
in something like this.

1015
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,039
Please.

1016
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,832
Don't spoil everything now!

1017
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,513
Please.

1018
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,793
Come out and
at least talk to us.

1019
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:27,028
Five minutes.
Just let us know
you're all right.

1020
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,429
MAN: Charlie Auden!
This is Dad, Charlie.

1021
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,952
Your mother and I are
pretty scared out here.

1022
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,554
She's crying all the time.
I can't stop her.

1023
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,158
You were never all that crazy
about this school.

1024
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,515
You've been complaining
all year.

1025
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,191
We can't figure out why you're
in there somewhere with a gun.

1026
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,075
I mean,
we just can't believe it.

1027
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,594
Come on home, Charlie.

1028
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,156
Look, you can go to
any kind of school
you want to.

1029
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,958
Just come out of there.

1030
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,271
Please come out.

1031
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,598
Don't hurt yourself.

1032
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,633
Come on out.

1033
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,874
WOMAN: Billy. Billy,
I hope you can hear me.

1034
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,799
Billy, look you've always
gone along with the crowd,

1035
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,558
and I know kids are like that.

1036
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,636
But this is one thing
you've got to do for
yourself.

1037
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:40,351
Sometimes being accepted by
your friends isn't worth
the price.

1038
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,032
Your real friends...

1039
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,111
Who goes there?
Lieutenant West.

1040
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,474
Advance and be recognized.

1041
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,678
Stand easy.

1042
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,110
Everything okay?
Yes, sir.

1043
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,349
What are your orders?

1044
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,750
Shoot
anything that comes over,
under or around the wall.

1045
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,559
On whose orders?

1046
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,551
Captain Shawn's, sir.

1047
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,308
Carry on.

1048
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,674
Yes, sir.

1049
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,954
Just a minute.

1050
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,109
Would you?

1051
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,668
Yes, sir. No problem, sir.

1052
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,630
Carry on.
Yes, sir.

1053
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,038
Any contact?

1054
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,478
No. Nothing.

1055
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,909
Maybe they just plan on,
you know, just coming in.

1056
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,990
They would have done that
if that's what they came for.

1057
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:42,079
I was hoping to get some
word on the general,
see how he's doing.

1058
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,917
Bug, go to the mess hall
and get us a pot of
hot coffee.

1059
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,388
Yes, sir.

1060
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,154
Sit down.

1061
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,628
Do you
really expect them
to negotiate with us?

1062
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:17,152
Yeah. They're not gonna stay
out there forever. We'll
hear from them.

1063
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,318
I don't know, Brian.

1064
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,953
Things might escalate.

1065
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,913
Escalate? How?

1066
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,915
For one thing,
Shawn's Red Berets
are really pumped up.

1067
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,112
There's a sentry out there
ready to shoot to kill.

1068
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,474
That's a sentry's job.

1069
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,551
What good is he if
he's not prepared
to shoot?

1070
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,834
Maybe he's a little
more than ready.

1071
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,229
And it's coming
from Shawn, Brian.

1072
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:46,916
I think he's running private
little pep rallies out there
for them or something.

1073
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,276
A natural-born leader.

1074
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,996
He's got me
a little worried, is all.

1075
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,513
He's too much into this.
He's at a pitch, man.

1076
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,750
He's always been
like that, Eddie.

1077
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:03,393
After the Hulk, who would
you want on your side if
you were in a fight?

1078

now to reporter Alex Dwyer
on the scene of the uprising.

1230
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,109
I'm outside the gates
of Bunker Hill Academy

1231
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,838
talking to
a National Guardsman,

1232
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,558
a young man not much
older than the infants

1233
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:51,791
who have taken over
this old institution.

1234
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,314
Let's see
what the grunt
on the street says.

1235
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,632
Trooper, how do you feel
about the possibility of
taking this school by force?

1236
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:00,950
Give me those!
I'd like to frag the freaks!

1237
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,550
Sir, what's your
opinion of this crisis?

1238
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,232
I feel sorry for
the little cherubs.

1239

It's society's fault.
We failed to meet
the needs...

1240

Thank you,
Private Bleeding Heart.

1241
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,077
We take you now
to a press meeting,
live in progress,

1242
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,879
with Colonel Adolf Kerby
of the National Guard.

1243
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,750
Can you hear me?
You're an ass, Dwyer.

1244
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,354
It's the governor's
fervent hope that force

1245
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,318
will not be necessary
in retaking the school.

1246
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,630
However,
the governor
will not stand by

1247
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,109
indefinitely and
allow this to continue.

1248

with Major Moreland.

Defending cadets.
Let's go. Come on.

1256

some dissension...

1257
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,110
No, this is
a military operation.

1258
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,475

no desertion and no...

station should sleep.

the press that easily.

1262

It's getting to be
a real pain in the ass!
Drop it!

1264
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,719
Back to you, Walter.
The major's getting
pissed off.

1265
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,153
Come on. Move out.

1266

And we don't want to
piss off the major.

save this school

01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,078
Please,
let's just give up, okay?

1381
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,319
I mean, we'll leave, okay?
Please?

1382
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,958
It'll be all right.

1383
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,632
No, it won't.

1384
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:46,797
Close your eyes.

1385
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,831
I can't.

1386
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,751
Get low, Derek. Come on.

1387

(SOBS)

1388
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:02,356
Derek! Derek, don't run!

1389
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:03,759

01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,751

KERBY: Hold your fire!

1393
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:10,918

1394
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:30,317
You boys in here,
this is the end of it.

1395
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,278
Right now, right here.

1396
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,635
You're coming out.
Someone finally
had to die.

1397
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,671
Kerby,
hold it right there!

1398
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,396
You will talk to
our men through us.

1399
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:46,233
I want all of you boys to know
that at dawn we will take
this campus.

1400
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:51,474
My men, our tanks,
our helicopters, we
will take this campus.

1401
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,311
I don't want to see
any more of you boys die.

1402
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:58,632
SHAWN: Men,
stand fast and listen up.

1403
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,517
You are soldiers.

1404
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,558
You will continue
to follow the orders
of your superior officers.

1405
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,153
You will continue...

1406
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,390
Those who don't
want this to happen,

1407
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,118
at dawn throw
down your weapons

1408
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,270
and run
to the nearest
National Guardsman.

1409
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:17,309
We will do our best to
protect you and to see
that you get out safely.

1410
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,437
Like they did Charlie!
The bastards killed him!

1411
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:28,919
Mr. Moreland!

1412
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:33,714
Dawn.

1413
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,271
I got a tank up here, Billy.

1414
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,031
Where's Moreland?

1415
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:03,839
Bug, where's Moreland?

1416
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:05,313
I don't know.

1417
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,398
Not here.

1418
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:09,668
Have you seen Shawn?

1419
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,074
No.

1420
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:13,276
They've all disappeared.

1421
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,798
I don't know where anybody is.

1422
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:32,395
BACHE'S VOICE:
...honor, country.

1423
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,234
These are the
virtues instilled in
a cadet at Bunker Hill.

1424
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,436
They form
the backbone
of a curriculum

1425
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:43,036
which has produced
a long and illustrious
line of soldiers and statesmen

1426
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,231
who have served
the United States

1427
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:48,471
with distinction
since before the
Civil War.

1428
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:53,035
At Bunker Hill our goal is
not only to educate the boy,

1429
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,512
it is to develop the man,
to plumb potential,

1430
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:02,757
to nurture it in an atmosphere
of strict discipline and
intensive training.

1431
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,674
Those boys who are dedicated
often find acceptance to
West Point,

1432
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,514
Annapolis or the Air Force
Academy, where...

1433
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,310
I was thinking about Charlie.

1434
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:34,197
You know, he came in here
scared of his own shadow,
homesick.

1435
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,269
Used to cry himself to sleep.

1436
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:44,638
I was betting
he wouldn't last the
first week of orientation.

1437
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:49,109
You'd call "Right face"
and he'd go in the
other direction.

1438
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:55,754
And by Thanksgiving
he was calling cadence.

1439
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:03,230
Never got a hit in inspection.
He turned out to be a tough
little kid.

1440
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:10,917
Always so eager to please.

1441
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,915
It's getting close to dawn.

1442
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,274
That plebe year,
it's a tough time.

1443
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,112
Yeah, it is.

1444
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:56,636
Some of them,
like Charlie,
thrive on it.

1445
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:02,515
I did. I... I thrived on it.

1446
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,631
I can't remember why anymore.

1447
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:16,834
I was thinking about

1448
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:21,948
that basketball game
we played, one on one,
last winter.

1449
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:30,270
It was so cold,
hurt to breathe,
and your fingers

1450
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,709
could barely feel the ball,
you know.

1451
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:36,276
There was no net on the hoop.

1452
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:41,957
We were always arguing the
other's shot didn't go in.
Laughing and acting crazy.

1453
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,833
Yeah. I remember that.

1454
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:50,989
It was so dark you
couldn't see the ball
against the backboard.

1455
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,630
I love that feeling.

1456
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:56,234
We'll have a rematch,
one on one.

1457
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:06,078
It's gonna
hurt like hell to
leave it all behind.

1458
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:09,709
No one leaves
it all behind, Brian.
We're gonna take it with us.

1459
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,508
Were they just words?

1460
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,394
Honor, duty, country?

1461
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:25,195
I loved that man.

1462
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:31,390
Being in his presence
made me feel privileged.

1463
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:45,793
But there had to
be something missing
in all that he taught us,

1464
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,235
or this wouldn't
have happened.

1465
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:21,275
I... I've done
a terrible thing here.

1466
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,959
You weren't alone.
We were all in it together.

1467
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:32,111
It was my command
and I was in charge.

1468
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:36,390
When I knelt
next to Charlie,

1469
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:41,431
I tried to find
some justification.

1470
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,151
But honor
doesn't count for shit

1471

at a dead little boy.

1472

or bugles or flags
or 21-gun salutes.

1474
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:06,509
All you think about is
what a neat little kid
he was...

1475
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,230
and how you're
gonna miss him.

1476
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,270
