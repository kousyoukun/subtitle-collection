00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:41,003
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

3
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,804
<i>Is Cristina there?</i>

4
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:44,605
No, she's not available.
May I take a message?

5
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,375
<i>Uh, yeah, well, um...</i>

6
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,409
<i>Yeah, sorry. I'm a friend
from her group...</i>

7
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,411
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

8
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,180
From her shit?

9
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,615
<i>Um...
Look, just tell her I'm from group.</i>

10
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:56,919
<i>I'm Charlie.
She's got my number.</i>

11
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:58,753
Oh, she goes to your group?

12
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:00,856
<i>I shouldn't have, um...</i>

13
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:03,424
<i>Look, just tell her
Charlie called.</i>

14
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,394
And I will do
exactly that, Charlie,

15
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,695
once you tell me what kind
of group we're talking about.

16
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,898
- Is it AA? NA?
- <i>Look...</i>

17
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:12,500
<i>You sound exactly like
she describes you.</i>

18
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,535
Uh,
does she talk about me in group?

19
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,239
<i>I don't think I
can really talk about that.</i>

20
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:19,408
What does she say about me?

21
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,310
<i>Well, she loves you very much.</i>

22
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,211
What does she love about me?

23
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:26,480
<i>Oh, okay. Well...</i>

24
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,582
<i>She loves that you're creative.</i>

25
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,086
<i>You love art
and TV and movies.</i>

26
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,554
Okay, well,
lots of people love movies.

27
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:36,724
<i>Yeah, but she says
you love scary movies</i>

28
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:38,994
<i>and that you guys
have that in common.</i>

29
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,696
<i>She's proud
of making a fan out of you.</i>

30
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,099
- She is?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

31
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:47,501
<i>Well, she told me the other
day, she wonders...</i>

32
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,072
<i>what's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

33
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:51,605
Uh... <i>The Babadook.</i>

34
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,976
It's an amazing meditation
on motherhood and grief.

35
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,847
<i>Isn't that
a little fancy pants?</i>

36
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,648
Well, it's elevated horror.

37
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,518
<i>Uh-huh.
What does that mean, "Elevated horror"?</i>

38
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,423
You know, it's scary but with complex
emotional and thematic underpinnings.

39
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:12,894
It's not just some schlocky, cheeseball
nonsense with wall-to-wall jump scares.

40
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:16,431
<i>Hmm.
Sounds kind of boring to me.</i>

41
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,867
<i>Have you ever seen</i> Stab?

42
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:21,769
Once, I think.

43
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:24,239
At a sleepover
when I was, like, 12.

44
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:29,277
<i>You live in Woodsboro
and you don't know</i> Stab?

45
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,678
<i>Your mother loves that movie.</i>

46
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:33,415
<i>She talks about it
all the time in group.</i>

47
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,716
<i>How well do you remember
the original?</i>

48
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:37,319
I don't know.

49
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:39,720
I mean, it was super '90s.

50
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:43,557
It was really over-lit
and everyone had weird hair.

51
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:47,195
<i>Uh-huh.
Do you remember the beginning?</i>

52
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,930
Not really.

53
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:50,465
It started with
a kill scene, right?

54
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,000
They always started
with a kill scene.

55
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:54,568
<i>Yeah, that's right.
That's right.</i>

56
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,005
<i>It's a girl at home, alone.</i>

57
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,674
<i>She answers a wrong number and
starts talking with the killer</i>

58
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,145
<i>who makes her play a game.</i>

59
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:06,882
<i>Would you like to
play a game...</i>

60
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,917
<i>Tara?</i>

61
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,599
<i>All systems armed.</i>

62
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:36,104
This isn't fucking funny, Amber.

63
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:39,908
<i>I told you, this isn't Amber.</i>

64
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,415
<i>Amber's looking
particularly fetching tonight.</i>

65
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:52,653
<i>She really shouldn't leave her phone
lying around for anyone to clone.</i>

66
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:54,422
What do you want?

67
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:58,026
<i>I told you,
I want to play a game.</i>

68
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,895
Stab <i>movie trivia,</i>
<i>three rounds.</i>

69
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:01,563
<i>You call the cops,
she dies.</i>

70
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,598
<i>You get a question wrong,
she dies.</i>

71
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,133
<i>Her parents aren't home.</i>

72
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:08,003
<i>I can be in that room
in 15 seconds.</i>

73
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:10,906
<i>You want a warmup question?</i>

74
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,808
I told you
I don't know these movies!

75
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,377
Ask me about something
I do know.

76
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,480
Ask me about <i>It Follows.</i>
Ask me about <i>Hereditary.</i>

77
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,881
Ask me about <i>The Witch.</i>

78
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,050
<i>In the first</i> Stab <i>movie,</i>

79
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,952
<i>what Woodsboro native
was introduced</i>

80
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:26,888
<i>as the franchise's
main character?</i>

81
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:29,357
It's Sidney Prescott!

82
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,459
It's Sidney Prescott
and she lived on Elm.

83
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:34,663
<i>Correct. You see,
you're gonna do great at this.</i>

84
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,797
<i>Okay, question one...</i>

85
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:39,201
No, I got that one right.
It should count.

86
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,002
<i>Anyone could have
gotten that one right.</i>

87
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:43,572
<i>Sidney's in every movie
but the last one.</i>

88
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:44,906
<i>Question one:</i>

89
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,908
<i>Who wrote the original book</i>

90
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:49,978
<i>that the</i> Stab <i>movies</i>
<i>are based on?</i>

91
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,983
Um... Um...

92
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:57,052
The... The chick from TV!

93
00:06:57,185 --> 00:07:00,889
<i>"The chick from TV"
is not gonna cut it, Tara.</i>

94
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:03,791
Gale Weathers!

95
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,994
It is Gale Weathers,
you motherfucker!

96
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:07,329
<i>Correct.</i>

97
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,564
<i>Amber might live
to see the sunrise.</i>

98
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:13,767
<i>Question two: Who played the dumb
bitch in the beginning of</i> Stab 1

99
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:18,039
<i>who answers the phone and
gets carved up by the killer?</i>

100
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:19,341
Fuck you.

101
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,509
<i>Is that the answer
you're going with?</i>

102
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,916
<i>A non-answer
counts as a wrong answer, Tara.</i>

103
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,451
<i>Time's running out.</i>

104
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:35,457
<i>Ticktock, ticktock,
ticktock, ticktock...</i>

105
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:37,525
Heather Graham!

106
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:41,429
<i>Correct!
You pulled that one out.</i>

107
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:44,065
<i>Now for the final question:</i>

108
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,870
<i>Who was the killer in</i> Stab 1?

109
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,440
Oh, I know this one, you fuck.

110
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,476
It's Billy Loomis!

111
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,411
It's Billy Loomis,
and he was Sidney's boyfriend,

112
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,547
he was played by Luke Wilson,
and I got you, asshole!

113
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:03,985
I got it! I got it right!

114
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:09,057
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, Tara,
but that's just not correct.</i>

115
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,759
What?

116
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,495
No, no, it is. It is.
That is right.

117
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:17,532
<i>The correct answer
is Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.</i>

118
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,502
<i>There are two killers</i>
<i>in the original</i> Stab.

119
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:23,905
<i>I'm afraid someone's
got to die now.</i>

120
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,841
No, no, no.
Amber, I'm coming.

121
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,146
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

122
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,598
<i>All systems armed.</i>

123
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:00,308
The police are on their way,
asshole!

124
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,187
<i>All systems disarmed.</i>

125
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:16,224
<i>All systems armed.</i>

126
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:21,162
- <i>All systems disarmed.</i>
- Oh, my God. No.

127
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:23,064
<i>All systems armed.</i>

128
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:26,501
<i>All systems disarmed.
All systems armed.</i>

129
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,837
<i>All systems disarmed.</i>

130
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,072
<i>All systems armed.</i>

131
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,038
Hello?

132
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:07,075
<i>Bonus question, Tara.</i>

133
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:09,611
Please stop.

134
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:12,180
<i>Do you think
I made it inside your house</i>

135
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:14,249
<i>before you could rearm?</i>

136
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:56,691
Help!

137
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:11,973
No! No, no, no!

138
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:44,339
Excuse me, miss?

139
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,842
- What'd you just take?
- Your boner pills.

140
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,344
Good luck getting it up now.

141
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:51,279
You, um...

142
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,748
You are my boner pills.

143
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:58,086
No. No.

144
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:09,597
You okay?

145
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:11,232
Yes.

146
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:14,302
You don't have to check on me all the time.
I'm not breakable.

147
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,170
Yeah, this I know.

148
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:21,709
Shit.

149
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:31,486
- <i>Sam?</i>
- Hey. What's going on?

150
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:36,457
<i>Uh, Tara...
was attacked.</i>

151
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,127
What? Is she...

152
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,263
<i>She's alive,
but in bad shape.</i>

153
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:44,332
<i>She was...</i>

154
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,301
<i>stabbed.</i>

155
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,938
- Stabbed? What the fuck?
- <i>She made it through surgery</i>

156
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,705
<i>and the doctor
said it went well.</i>

157
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,440
<i>She's resting now.</i>

158
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,609
<i>I know you guys
aren't on the best terms, but...</i>

159
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:56,077
I'm on my way.

160
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,048
<i>She's gonna be okay, Sam.
We'll see you soon.</i>

161
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,783
- Hey, wait, Wes!
- <i>Yeah?</i>

162
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,786
Do they know who did this?

163
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,122
<i>It's probably better
if you just come here.</i>

164
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,557
Wes.

165
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:11,192
<i>She said it was someone</i>

166
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:13,394
<i>in a fucking Ghostface mask.</i>

167
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:22,737
My sister was attacked.

168
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,673
I gotta go.

169
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:28,209
Wait, hey! Hey, hey hey.
I'm... I'm going with you.

170
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:32,180
- No. No, Richie...
- No, Sam. I'm coming with you.

171
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,850
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

172
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:38,887
<i>Attention, Panthers.</i>

173
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:42,256
<i>A reminder that all classes
and school activities</i>

174
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,760
<i>are canceled tomorrow
due to public safety concerns.</i>

175
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:46,862
That was Sam.

176
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:49,497
- She's coming?
- Yeah.

177
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:51,934
Watch everything get worse.

178
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:54,736
All I'm saying is,
with everything going on right now,

179
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,273
I think it's time we take our relationship
to the next, most intimate level.

180
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:01,643
He wants me to accept
his Find My Fam request.

181
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:04,646
It's the smartest option with
a would-be killer on the loose.

182
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,281
You know exactly where I am and
I know exactly where you are.

183
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:09,283
Aw, you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend.

184
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,285
And you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend.

185
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,522
Is this because you two
aren't having sex yet?

186
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:16,190
You bring up a very good point.

187
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:18,393
Not that I want to sound
like a stereotypical jock

188
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,561
- trying to get into his girl's pants...
- Great!

189
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,965
Don't do it, Liv.
There's a psycho out there.

190
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:24,365
You make yourself
harder to find.

191
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,901
Delete social media,
tape over your phone camera,

192
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:27,201
disable GPS.

193
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:29,170
Yes, thank you very much,
Edward Snowden.

194
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:32,173
Actually, your mother just interrogated
me about Tara's attempted murder,

195
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,942
which was very fun.

196
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:37,846
I'm sure she's asking everybody.
I mean, Ghostface is back.

197
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,514
The press
still isn't saying Ghostface.

198
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:40,949
My mom doesn't want
to cause a panic.

199
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,851
It'll get out by the second
or third killing.

200
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:46,788
Jesus, Mindy, there wasn't
a first killing. Tara's alive.

201
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:49,791
- Mmm. I mean, she could still die.
- What the fuck?

202
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:51,225
Or the killer
could come back for her.

203
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,493
Fuck! Mindy, come on.

204
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:54,262
I'm just telling you,
arm up, okay?

205
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,397
Pepper spray, check.
Taser, check.

206
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:57,866
Girlfriend repellent, check.

207
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:00,969
Nice. Thank you.

208
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:04,739
Holy shit.
Is that... Vince?

209
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:07,142
Wait. The creep
you hooked up with last summer?

210
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:11,446
- Yeah. He worked with me and Tara.
- He worked with Tara?

211
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,315
He's been stalking my Instagram
the last couple weeks,

212
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:17,418
posting the creepiest shit.

213
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,654
Probably time to introduce him
to Hobbs and Shaw.

214
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:22,290
Maybe not the best idea
to incite violence

215
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,093
right in front
of the sheriff.

216
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:25,861
Looks like he's leaving.

217
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:27,930
Thanks anyways, boys.

218
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:29,530
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

219
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:32,266
Hmm. Tara says
she fought back hard.

220
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,634
You've got bruises.

221
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,236
It's from football practice.

222
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:38,473
- Oh, sure.
- Tara's awake. She just texted.

223
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,374
I'm going to the hospital.
You guys coming?

224
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:41,977
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

225
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,578
Oh, uh...
I can't,

226
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,080
but I'll meet
you guys there.

227
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:46,748
All right.

228
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:59,027
- I've actually never seen <i>Stab.</i>
- You've never seen <i>Stab?</i>

229
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:02,030
- Mmm.
- Not even the one that came out last year?

230
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:04,099
I've never seen
<i>Gone with the Wind</i> either,

231
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:07,803
but I don't consider it, like,
a huge hole in my cinematic education.

232
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:11,639
Most of the <i>Stab</i> movies are based
on things that happened here.

233
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,741
Define "things."

234
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:14,810
Things like...

235
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:17,311
a guy named Billy Loomis
and his friend

236
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:19,148
carved up a bunch
of high-school kids

237
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,050
while wearing
this Halloween ghost mask.

238
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,986
You mean like
in <i>Halloween?</i>

239
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,455
- No. Not like in <i>Halloween.</i>
- Oh.

240
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:29,958
Sounds a lot
like <i>Halloween.</i>

241
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:31,994
- All right, it's a little like <i>Halloween.</i>
- Okay.

242
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:36,098
And every decade or so,
some idiot gets the bright idea

243
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:39,234
to put on the mask, kill his
friends, and get famous too.

244
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,469
The last time it happened
was in 2011.

245
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:43,504
And we came here
voluntarily?

246
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:46,041
Well, I got to make sure
Tara's okay.

247
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:47,810
Right. Yes, of course.

248
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:49,945
And I got to make sure we don't
get sliced up by some lunatic

249
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,047
who saw <i>Friday the 13th</i> and
thought, "You know what?

250
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:56,084
That Jason guy,
he's got some pretty solid ideas."

251
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:59,587
Can I ask you
one question though?

252
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,454
Yeah.

253
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:02,090
Do you have any idea why

254
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:05,760
someone wearing that mask
would want to kill your sister?

255
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:07,963
No.

256
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:30,085
How are you feeling?

257
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:31,887
You came.

258
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,654
Of course I came.

259
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,158
This is my boyfriend,
Richie.

260
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,127
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry if I'm intruding.

261
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,795
Nice to meet you too.

262
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:44,432
Hi.

263
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,635
- Thank you for calling.
- Of course.

264
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:51,572
Look at your hair!
I like it.

265
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:54,609
These are Chad and Mindy,
the twins. And Wes.

266
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:55,944
I used to babysit them all.

267
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:58,247
Which is always how
I like to be introduced.

268
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,850
And Amber. Hey.

269
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,518
Hi. Nice to see you.

270
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:06,587
Hi. I'm Richie.

271
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,890
Hi.

272
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:09,124
Where's Mom?

273
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:10,391
She's stuck
at a conference in London.

274
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,626
She called me earlier.

275
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,929
Yeah, for all of ten minutes.

276
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:17,299
Uh, look, guys,
Tara's really tired.

277
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,001
Maybe we should
just give her some space.

278
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:20,302
Yeah.

279
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,004
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

280
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:25,473
Not you, Sam.

281
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:27,876
I want you to stay.

282
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:29,344
Okay.

283
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:31,046
- But the rest.
- Yeah.

284
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:36,985
If it's okay with you,
I could sleep here tonight.

285
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,854
I'd really like that.

286
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,088
Okay.

287
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:42,790
- Do you have your extra inhaler?
- I'll be fine.

288
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:43,959
Okay.

289
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,096
Bye.

290
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,865
- Okay, I'll be right outside.
- Thank you.

291
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,199
Bye.

292
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,811
Sam,
I was so scared.

293
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:06,248
I know. It's okay.

294
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:13,088
<i>So what is she like,
the sister?</i>

295
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:14,957
Sam?
Oh, Sam is so cool.

296
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,724
You only say that
because she let you

297
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,492
wear Pokémon onesies
to bed for a year.

298
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,963
True. That's a true statement.

299
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:24,665
No, trust me. Sam is not cool.
Her dad left her mom, right?

300
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,668
Walks right out when Tara's
eight, Sam's 13.

301
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:30,238
Sam started acting out,
getting in trouble with the cops.

302
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:34,343
And then, on Sam's 18th
birthday, she leaves.

303
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:35,576
Ghosts them all.

304
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,611
Maybe Sam's changed.

305
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:39,381
I just don't want
to see Tara hurt again.

306
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:43,018
So what, you're protecting Tara
from her own sister now?

307
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,585
Well, someone has to.

308
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,855
Okay, so no guys
are good enough for her,

309
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:48,622
and now her family's
off-limits too?

310
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:50,558
Mmm, motive.

311
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,394
"If I can't have her,
no one can."

312
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,561
What?

313
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,163
We know
you have a crush on Tara.

314
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:56,597
Okay.
Come on, Mindy.

315
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,867
But we're all suspects.

316
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:04,739
- Except maybe Liv.
- Thank you.

317
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:06,274
You're way too boring
to be a psycho.

318
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,810
Yo, Liv.
You want a real drink?

319
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:11,413
Or are you happy sitting
at this kids' table?

320
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,816
Listen up, uglier Michael
Myers, it was a summer fling.

321
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,684
- It meant nothing.
- Was I talking to you?

322
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:17,986
I don't care
who you're talking to.

323
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,620
- Liv, let's go.
- Don't talk to her!

324
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:21,356
I don't want to hear
your voice.

325
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,723
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hey!

326
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:25,160
Get out of here
or I'm calling the cops.

327
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:26,694
Go!

328
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,864
- I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
- Hey, man, fuck you.

329
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,166
You kids too! Let's go!

330
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,969
Do you see this shit?

331
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,974
Fuck this bar, man.

332
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:44,913
Fuck you.

333
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:50,285
Fuck it!

334
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:54,923
What the fuck?

335
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:09,770
What the fuck?

336
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:16,178
Is that you, pretty boy? Huh?

337
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,712
Get out of my fucking car!

338
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:10,866
Hey.

339
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,136
- You okay?
- Yeah.

340
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,204
Just a bad dream.

341
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,340
What are you watching?

342
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:21,042
Oh, <i>Stab</i> is on Netflix.

343
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:25,147
What?
I want to be prepared.

344
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:27,748
I got to go
find something to eat.

345
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:29,317
Yeah, okay.

346
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,009
How you doing, Sam?

347
00:22:56,811 --> 00:23:01,449
Mmm. Antipsychotics aren't working
as well as they used to, are they?

348
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:02,817
Fuck you.

349
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,054
You can't run
from who you are, Sam.

350
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:07,989
I'm just trying to help.

351
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:13,428
Hey, when are you gonna tell her
why all this is happening?

352
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:21,870
<i>Blue team, ICU.</i>

353
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,444
Hello.

354
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:31,880
<i>Hello, Samantha.</i>

355
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:36,284
Who is this?

356
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:39,487
<i>Someone who knows
your little family secret.</i>

357
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:43,058
You're the fuck
who hurt my sister?

358
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:45,994
<i>Oh, she's not
the only one I'm gonna hurt.</i>

359
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:50,899
<i>I had to get you to come
back here somehow, didn't I?</i>

360
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:53,201
You want to fuck with me,
asshole?

361
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:55,604
I'm right here. Come and get me.

362
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:57,505
<i>With pleasure.</i>

363
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:13,989
Help!

364
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,865
Help! Help!

365
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,935
Somebody help me!
He's trying to kill me!

366
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,871
What's going on?
You're okay.

367
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,140
Somebody tried to kill me
in the break room!

368
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:45,720
I've got a body
outside a bar on Main,

369
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,289
and now you get attacked here.

370
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:49,090
You said the call came
from Amber's number?

371
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:52,027
So? We know he cloned my phone
before when he attacked Tara.

372
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,497
Or, and I'm just
spit-balling here...

373
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,797
you're the killer.

374
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:58,933
And where were you
when all this happened?

375
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,903
I was...
watching Netflix.

376
00:25:02,037 --> 00:25:05,340
- Yeah. Super-solid alibi, bro.
- So where were you?

377
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:07,942
I was questioning her
at the sheriff's station.

378
00:25:08,076 --> 00:25:09,477
Yeah,
I came as soon as I heard.

379
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:11,379
But, you know,
the Netflix alibi is good, too.

380
00:25:11,513 --> 00:25:12,614
Both of you,
stop it.

381
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,449
You're gonna put more cops
on her room, right?

382
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:15,950
Yes.

383
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:17,619
And I can move you
to a private floor.

384
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:19,988
Deputy Vinson knows what he's doing.
You'll be safe.

385
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:21,556
Like we've been so far?

386
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:25,193
Samantha,
let's step outside.

387
00:25:29,164 --> 00:25:31,866
Nice to see you,
Deputy Hicks.

388
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,469
- So many fun memories.
- It's "Sheriff" Hicks.

389
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:36,338
I remember you too...

390
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:39,140
and all the trouble
you used to cause your family.

391
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,110
Your presence here
is not helping.

392
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:43,878
So maybe when the sun comes up,

393
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:45,580
you and your boyfriend
can hit the road

394
00:25:45,714 --> 00:25:48,516
and leave it to people who
actually care about this community.

395
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:03,698
Well,
she remains a delight.

396
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,133
Are you okay?

397
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:07,435
Um, would you mind
giving us a second?

398
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,003
I need to talk to Tara.

399
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:10,405
Come on, Netflix.
Let's go.

400
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:29,991
Do you remember
when Dad left?

401
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:32,527
Parts, sure.

402
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:36,464
I was eight. I don't know what
that has to do with anything.

403
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:38,400
It has to do with it.

404
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,439
Do you remember how...

405
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:47,142
Mom used to keep those boxes
up in the attic?

406
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:49,944
Well, I was up there once,

407
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:53,615
when I was 13,
looking for Christmas presents.

408
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:56,985
And I found these old diaries
that she kept from high school.

409
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:59,087
- Sam, what is...
- Please.

410
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,022
I just... I have to do this.

411
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:02,825
So I found these old diaries.

412
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:06,594
And I knew it was wrong,
but I read some anyway

413
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:08,898
because Mom got pregnant
with me in high school,

414
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,333
and I thought it could be cool to
find out how she and Dad got together.

415
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:14,536
How romantic
it must have been.

416
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,172
So I read some.

417
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:20,308
Only it wasn't romantic.

418
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:23,978
Mom was dating Dad, but...

419
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:27,883
she was in love
with this other guy...

420
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:30,084
and he got her pregnant.

421
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,020
She told Dad it was his,

422
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,354
and that's why
he proposed senior year.

423
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:34,589
Sam, what are you talking about?

424
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:37,058
And I'm sitting there,
in this attic,

425
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,160
and I'm 13...

426
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:43,097
and I just found out
my dad isn't my dad.

427
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:49,103
So I go find Mom in her bedroom,
and I'm screaming at her

428
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:51,841
and shoving this diary
in her face,

429
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:54,008
and I didn't even realize...

430
00:27:54,142 --> 00:27:56,578
that Dad was standing
right behind me.

431
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:00,415
He didn't know.

432
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:05,420
He found out right then from me.

433
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:10,558
He left that night.

434
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,261
I'm the reason he left.

435
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:14,729
No.

436
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:16,966
- No, Sam...
- Mom never forgave me.

437
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:21,135
Then she made me promise never to
tell you because you were so young.

438
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:24,372
And that's why I changed

439
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:29,143
and I got distant
and weird with you.

440
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:33,214
And I went out
and I started doing

441
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:36,217
every drug
that I could get my hands on

442
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:39,087
until I couldn't take it anymore
and I left town.

443
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,257
I just couldn't be
around you anymore, Tara.

444
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,026
Not only because I destroyed
our family that night,

445
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:46,427
but because...

446
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:50,064
those diaries told me
who my real father was.

447
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:55,136
It was Billy Loomis.

448
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:57,272
And somebody knows,

449
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:59,107
and I think
that's why you got hurt.

450
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,878
And I'm so fucking sorry that I
never told you and that I ran away.

451
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:04,345
- I'm so sorry.
- Get out.

452
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,814
Tara.

453
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:08,149
You're gone
for five years...

454
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:09,784
Five whole years.

455
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,820
And then I get stabbed
and you want to come back

456
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:13,421
and drop
all this shit on me?

457
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:16,624
- I thought I was protecting you.
- Protecting me from what?

458
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:20,228
The truth?

459
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:22,096
No.

460
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,632
- No, I... Please, Tara.
- Sam.

461
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:27,903
- I need you to get the fuck out.
- I'm so sorry.

462
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,203
- Sam.
- Please.

463
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:31,339
Get the fuck out!

464
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:53,227
Hey, hey. It's okay, it's me.

465
00:29:54,997 --> 00:29:56,664
Were you listening
at the door?

466
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:59,200
No, no,
of course not.

467
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,604
Okay, yeah,
I was listening at the door.

468
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:04,739
It doesn't freak you out...

469
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:07,876
that my real father
was a serial killer?

470
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:09,677
I mean...

471
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:11,446
yeah.

472
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:13,348
A great deal, yeah.

473
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,384
Okay, well, then go.
I get it.

474
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:19,454
I just got to stay
and figure it out.

475
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:21,356
I'm not leaving you here, Sam.

476
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,892
You know that part
in horror movies

477
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:26,194
where you want to yell
at the characters to be smart

478
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:27,896
and get the fuck out?

479
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:31,332
This is that part, Richie.

480
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:33,368
You should get the fuck out.

481
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:38,640
But I'm staying.

482
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,611
I love you.

483
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:51,552
- You're such a dumbass.
- I'm such a dumbass.

484
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:53,956
So...

485
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:56,290
your sister won't talk to you.

486
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,861
The police aren't gonna help.

487
00:30:58,994 --> 00:31:00,628
What's our next move?

488
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:04,867
We go talk to an expert.

489
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:10,806
<i>...temperatures
here Tuesday, Wednesday in the mid-50s,</i>

490
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:13,876
<i>and then finally we'll see those
mid-60s returning next week.</i>

491
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:17,345
<i>Just one night after a
local teen was attacked in her home</i>

492
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:19,714
<i>by an assailant
wearing a Ghostface costume,</i>

493
00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:22,784
<i>Sheriff Judy Hicks has now confirmed
two more late-night attacks</i>

494
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:24,820
<i>that have left Woodsboro
reeling.</i>

495
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:26,587
<i>The first victim,
Vincent Schneider,</i>

496
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:29,158
<i>was found dead behind
the Corner Pocket Pool Hall.</i>

497
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,126
<i>A second victim,
as yet unnamed,</i>

498
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:35,430
<i>was attacked inside Woodsboro General
Hospital, but escaped without injuries.</i>

499
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:38,133
<i>Needless to say, Woodsboro
is on high alert today...</i>

500
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:41,502
<i>Live from Studio
1-A in Rockefeller Plaza...</i>

501
00:31:41,636 --> 00:31:43,271
<i>Good morning.
I'm Gale Weathers.</i>

502
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:46,674
<i>Before we dive in,
I want to tell you a little story</i>

503
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:49,377
<i>that happened on the way
into the studio this morning.</i>

504
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,679
<i>I stopped to get a bacon...</i>

505
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:54,515
<i>...at a bodega, already
a quintessentially New York...</i>

506
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:55,717
Go away!

507
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:58,219
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Riley!

508
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:00,655
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

509
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:03,391
I don't give interviews.

510
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:04,927
We're not looking
for an interview.

511
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,763
Give me one good reason
why I should talk to you.

512
00:32:08,897 --> 00:32:11,299
I'm Billy Loomis's daughter.

513
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,369
That's a terrible reason
for me to talk to you.

514
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:17,672
My name is Samantha Carpenter.

515
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:19,808
I was attacked last night
at the hospital.

516
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:23,244
The night before that,
my sister was stabbed seven times.

517
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:24,947
I know you know
what that's like.

518
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,050
I'm just trying
to protect my family.

519
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:31,954
Five minutes.
That's all I'm asking.

520
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:35,623
I'll give you
two minutes.

521
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:37,291
I'm missing a show I like.

522
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:39,393
<i>...bangs again,
stage an intervention.</i>

523
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:40,996
Gale Weathers.

524
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,265
- Weren't you two, um...
- Yeah.

525
00:32:53,142 --> 00:32:54,176
Who's he?

526
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,377
Oh, this is Richie,
my boyfriend.

527
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:58,247
How long have
you known him?

528
00:32:58,379 --> 00:32:59,547
Six months?

529
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,917
Did he know who your dad was
when you met?

530
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,318
Express any interest
in Woodsboro

531
00:33:04,452 --> 00:33:06,420
or the Ghostface killings?

532
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:08,090
What the hell
are you talking about?

533
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:10,993
Your killer's obsessed
with the <i>Stab</i> movies, right?

534
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:15,831
Well, there are certain rules
to surviving a <i>Stab</i> movie.

535
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:18,432
Believe me, I know.

536
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,170
Rule number one:

537
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:23,038
Never trust
the love interest.

538
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:26,507
They seem sweet, caring, supportive.
Then welcome to act 3,

539
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:27,943
where they're trying
to rip your head off.

540
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:30,745
I was with Sam in Modesto
when Tara was attacked.

541
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:32,915
And let me guess,
you were just in the other room,

542
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:36,185
conveniently unaccounted for when
she was attacked at the hospital.

543
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:39,654
Okay, do I have to take this from
shitty Sam Elliott over here, or what?

544
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:42,157
Rule number two...

545
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:46,694
...the killer's motive is always
connected to something in the past.

546
00:33:47,762 --> 00:33:49,430
- I'm related to Billy.
- Right,

547
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:52,333
but then why kill
that random Vince guy?

548
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:53,969
That's for you
to figure out.

549
00:33:54,102 --> 00:33:57,306
And rule number three,
and this is the most important rule:

550
00:33:57,438 --> 00:34:02,110
The first victim always has a friend
group that the killer is a part of.

551
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:05,280
Does your sister have a
close-knit group of friends?

552
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:06,882
Yeah.

553
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:09,517
She does.

554
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,352
Then look for the killer there.

555
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:14,189
If you can find out
why they're doing this,

556
00:34:14,323 --> 00:34:15,891
you can figure out
who's next.

557
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:18,093
So help us.

558
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:20,896
Help us figure out
who is behind this.

559
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:23,798
You kidding me?
I've been stabbed nine times.

560
00:34:23,932 --> 00:34:26,400
I've got permanent nerve damage
and a fun little limp.

561
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,469
You think I want
to do that again?

562
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:32,440
You just said it always goes
back to the past, right?

563
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:36,477
So if I'm in danger...

564
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:38,981
that means you're in danger.

565
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:41,515
Come on.

566
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,052
Let's do this together.

567
00:34:47,189 --> 00:34:48,156
Your time's up.

568
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,690
Jesus!

569
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,996
Yeah, he's way more fun
in the movies.

570
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:58,499
Okay, uh,
what's next?

571
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:00,035
The friends.

572
00:35:01,702 --> 00:35:03,404
<i>Thanks so much for that, Kevin.</i>

573
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:04,873
<i>Coming up after
our local weather,</i>

574
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:07,910
<i>the pros and cons of
reuniting with old friends.</i>

575
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:37,505
Hello?

576
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,440
<i>Hey, Sid, it's me.</i>

577
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:41,944
Dewey?

578
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:44,478
Oh, my God.
How long has it been?

579
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:47,349
I'm just trying to get a run in
before I take the girls to school.

580
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,417
How are you?

581
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:50,419
I'm good,
really good.

582
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,120
How are you?
How's Mark?

583
00:35:52,254 --> 00:35:53,721
I think I'll keep him.

584
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,656
How are things
in the sheriff's business?

585
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,392
Uh, they're...

586
00:35:57,525 --> 00:36:01,196
- They're fine. But, Sid...
- <i>Have you talked to Gale lately?</i>

587
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,598
No. Not in a couple years.

588
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:07,768
I know things didn't end well
with you guys, but...

589
00:36:07,903 --> 00:36:08,971
Sid...

590
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:10,872
it's happening again.

591
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,345
What are you talking about?

592
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:18,947
<i>Some idiot in a Ghostface mask.</i>

593
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:21,749
<i>Three attacks so far.
One dead.</i>

594
00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:24,785
Something about this one
just feels different.

595
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,156
Are you okay?

596
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,459
<i>I'm fine,
you know me.</i>

597
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,361
Yeah.

598
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:34,029
I do. That's why I'm asking.

599
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:36,298
I'm fine.

600
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:37,698
I just...

601
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,901
want you to be safe up there.
Do you have a gun?

602
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:43,472
I'm Sidney fucking Prescott.
Of course I have a gun.

603
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,075
Good. That's good.

604
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:49,144
Does Gale know?

605
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:51,079
No, she's my next call.

606
00:36:51,645 --> 00:36:52,981
But, Sid, promise me:

607
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:56,151
<i>No matter what you hear
or what you see on the news,</i>

608
00:36:56,284 --> 00:36:57,486
<i>don't come here.</i>

609
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:58,854
No offense, Dewey.
I have no intention

610
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:00,889
of ever setting foot
in that town again.

611
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:02,656
Good.

612
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,460
Dewey...

613
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:08,830
<i>whoever this killer's after,
I'm glad they have you to protect them.</i>

614
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:11,565
But...

615
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:14,136
you be safe, okay?

616
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:16,670
Will do.

617
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:18,807
<i>It's good to hear your voice.</i>

618
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:20,674
You too, Sid.

619
00:37:23,544 --> 00:37:26,448
Come on.
Get it together, Dewey.

620
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:51,306
Probably shouldn't
have sent the smiley face.

621
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:35,383
Holy shit. He came.

622
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:42,290
I've decided to temporarily
assist you in your investigation.

623
00:38:42,424 --> 00:38:43,892
Thank you.

624
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:47,661
Look, just because
that guy showered

625
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:49,730
doesn't mean
he should have a gun.

626
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:52,633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

627
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,507
How do you know
so much about the <i>Stab</i> movies?

628
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,242
Runs in her family.

629
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:02,077
Randy was our uncle.

630
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,045
RIP.

631
00:39:05,347 --> 00:39:07,748
You said to bring everybody.

632
00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:09,217
Hey.

633
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:13,188
Ooh, suspects!

634
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:16,358
My brother
would be so proud.

635
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:18,059
Hey, Martha.

636
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:21,396
Dewey! Hi!

637
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,031
You look...

638
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:26,168
Yeah.

639
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:27,735
How's the wife?

640
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:29,538
Mom, we're good.
Thank you.

641
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,807
All right, kids,
have fun.

642
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:38,079
I asked Mindy to call everybody
here, because...

643
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:42,317
there's something
I have to tell you.

644
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:45,187
Let me get this straight.

645
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,556
You're saying that you're
the daughter of Billy Loomis,

646
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,790
and, what,
that one of us is the killer?

647
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:52,561
The killer told me
he knew my secret.

648
00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:55,096
He attacked Tara
to lure me back here.

649
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,599
But then why
immediately go and murder

650
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,767
some douche-nozzle
that was stalking Liv?

651
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:01,403
And why
does it have to be one of us?

652
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,839
What about Deputy Dewey here?
Maybe he's the killer.

653
00:40:05,307 --> 00:40:06,208
No offense.

654
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:08,543
None taken,
but what's my motive?

655
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:10,478
You got stabbed a billion times,

656
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:13,548
got dumped by your famous wife
and crawled into a bottle.

657
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:15,884
I think it's safe to say
you're on the suspect list.

658
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:18,019
Well, maybe you're the killer.

659
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:20,355
Because that cut deep.

660
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:23,258
That douche-nozzle
is connected.

661
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:26,161
I googled him.
His mom is Leslie Macher.

662
00:40:26,995 --> 00:40:29,064
- Stu Macher's sister.
- Who's Stu Macher?

663
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:31,466
He's Billy Loomis's accomplice.

664
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,268
A real loony tune.

665
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,036
Okay. Okay.

666
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,641
So the first three attacks are all on
people related to the original killers.

667
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:42,344
Oh, my God.
He's making a requel!

668
00:40:42,477 --> 00:40:43,345
A what?

669
00:40:43,478 --> 00:40:44,512
Or a legacyquel.

670
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:45,680
Fans are torn
on the terminology.

671
00:40:45,814 --> 00:40:46,815
Please speak English.

672
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:48,016
Remember the <i>Stab</i> movie

673
00:40:48,149 --> 00:40:49,284
that came out last year?

674
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,418
Oh, yeah!

675
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:51,920
The one the <i>Knives Out</i> guy
directed?

676
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:53,655
I actually really liked
that one.

677
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,423
Of course you did.
You have terrible taste.

678
00:40:55,557 --> 00:40:56,858
I hate you.

679
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:59,661
The point is, the hard-core
<i>Stab</i> fans hated it.

680
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:01,029
You go on 4chan
and Dreadit,

681
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:02,664
all they're talking about
is how <i>Stab 8</i>

682
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:04,199
pissed on their childhoods.

683
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,334
How they crammed in social
commentary just to elevate it.

684
00:41:06,468 --> 00:41:08,136
How the main character's
a Mary Sue.

685
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,804
- What's a Mary Sue?
- You really don't want to know.

686
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:11,940
What's wrong
with elevated horror?

687
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:13,975
I mean,
Jordan Peele fucking rules.

688
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:16,278
Uh, obviously,
but that's not <i>Stab.</i>

689
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:21,082
Real <i>Stab</i> movies are meta
slasher whodunits, full stop.

690
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:23,551
- Come on. It's just a movie.
- No, it's not.

691
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:26,955
To some people, the original is
their favorite thing in the world.

692
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:29,424
The movie that made them
love horror.

693
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:32,761
That Mom or Dad showed them when they
were ten that bonded them together.

694
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:36,364
And God help anyone who slightly
fucks with that special memory.

695
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:38,533
Who makes a movie
they think disrespects it.

696
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:42,937
It sounds like our killer is
writing his own version of <i>Stab 8,</i>

697
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:45,573
but doing it as a requel.

698
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:46,741
Which is?

699
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:50,545
See, you can't just reboot a
franchise from scratch anymore.

700
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,980
The fans won't stand for it.

701
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:54,616
<i>Black Christmas, Child's Play,
Flatliners...</i>

702
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:56,084
That shit doesn't work.

703
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:58,620
But you can't just do
a straight sequel, either.

704
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:00,188
You got to build something new.

705
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:03,024
But not too new,
or the Internet goes bug-fucking nuts.

706
00:42:03,158 --> 00:42:05,026
It got to be part
of an ongoing story line,

707
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,530
even if the story shouldn't have
been ongoing in the first place.

708
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:10,098
New main characters, yes,

709
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:13,835
but supported by and related to
legacy characters.

710
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:15,970
Not quite a reboot,
not quite a sequel.

711
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:17,572
Like the new <i>Halloween, Saw,</i>

712
00:42:17,706 --> 00:42:19,841
<i>Terminator, Jurassic
Park, Ghostbusters...</i>

713
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:21,176
fuck, even <i>Star Wars!</i>

714
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:24,979
It always, always goes back
to the original!

715
00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:29,984
Are you telling me that I'm caught
in the middle of fan-fucking-fiction?

716
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:33,488
Not just in the middle, Sam.

717
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:35,590
You're the star.

718
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,762
So, not to put
too fine a point on it,

719
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:44,432
but, according
to requel rules...

720
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:47,369
...who's next?

721
00:42:47,936 --> 00:42:49,504
Going by the pattern,

722
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:53,274
whoever it is has to be connected
to someone that came before.

723
00:42:57,345 --> 00:42:59,514
I'm starting
to regret coming here.

724
00:42:59,647 --> 00:43:01,282
Jesus, my mom was
a character in one of them.

725
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:03,918
No one cares about the shitty
inferior sequels, Wes.

726
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:05,019
You're safe.

727
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:06,554
With Randy as our uncle, though,

728
00:43:06,688 --> 00:43:07,789
you and I are probably screwed.

729
00:43:07,956 --> 00:43:09,524
- Wait. What?
- Or you're the killer,

730
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:13,361
and this whole elaborate monologue
is just to cover your tracks.

731
00:43:13,495 --> 00:43:17,232
I think it's pretty clear
who the killer is at this point.

732
00:43:17,365 --> 00:43:18,400
Who?

733
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:20,502
You.

734
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:21,703
What...

735
00:43:21,837 --> 00:43:23,705
It makes perfect
requel sense.

736
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,074
- That actually does make sense.
- Yeah.

737
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:32,180
Fuck this.

738
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:35,950
- Meet you back at the motel.
- Sam, wait.

739
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:37,352
Sam, wait.

740
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:42,157
The first fucking rule of
these movies is don't split up!

741
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:48,930
The nerve of that girl,
right?

742
00:43:50,532 --> 00:43:53,101
Really not
in the mood right now.

743
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:54,269
Sam, Sam, Sam.

744
00:43:54,402 --> 00:43:56,471
There is a killer
on the loose.

745
00:43:56,604 --> 00:43:58,573
He's threatening you.
He's threatening your sister.

746
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:01,476
Are you gonna run away from
who you are like you always do,

747
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:02,944
or are you gonna use it?

748
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,446
I'm not like you.

749
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:05,447
Really?

750
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,682
Then how else
are you gonna survive?

751
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:11,619
I say accept who you are, let's get
out there, find out who's doing this,

752
00:44:11,753 --> 00:44:13,688
and cut some
fucking throats!

753
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:15,089
No!

754
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:25,333
Mmm. And extra edamame.
Please.

755
00:44:26,334 --> 00:44:29,037
Thank you.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

756
00:44:30,338 --> 00:44:31,406
Bye.

757
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:40,315
That you, tiger?

758
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:20,188
Jesus!

759
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:24,827
Are you being safe out there,
honey?

760
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,329
To the point that
all my friends mock me, yes.

761
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:29,297
Good boy.

762
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,933
What's for dinner?

763
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:33,134
Sushi. I was just leaving
to pick it up.

764
00:45:33,268 --> 00:45:35,436
Oh. Why don't you
just Postmates it?

765
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,973
Oh, it gets all smooshy
by the time it's here.

766
00:45:38,106 --> 00:45:40,009
I know you hate that.

767
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:41,977
- Go shower. I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

768
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,579
- Can you put this away for me?
- Yes.

769
00:45:45,848 --> 00:45:47,348
Okay.

770
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:49,150
- Love you.
- Love you.

771
00:45:49,284 --> 00:45:51,252
- Lock the door.
- I will.

772
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:29,992
Sheriff Hicks.

773
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:32,760
<i>Hello, Sheriff Judy.</i>

774
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:35,630
- Who is this?
- <i>I think you know.</i>

775
00:46:35,763 --> 00:46:39,534
<i>I'm a fan of scary movies.
And knives.</i>

776
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:42,938
<i>What's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

777
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:45,373
I prefer animated films
and musicals.

778
00:46:45,506 --> 00:46:47,408
Why are you doing this?

779
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:51,847
<i>I'll tell you all about it.
I'm calling to turn myself in.</i>

780
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:53,348
I think that's a great idea.

781
00:46:53,481 --> 00:46:54,950
<i>We'll sit down at the station,</i>

782
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:58,020
<i>and I'll tell you about
the two people I've killed.</i>

783
00:46:58,152 --> 00:46:59,487
You've only killed one person.

784
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:02,156
<i>By the time I see you,</i>

785
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,893
<i>I'll have gutted your baby boy.</i>

786
00:47:05,027 --> 00:47:06,829
No.

787
00:47:06,962 --> 00:47:08,296
Whoa.

788
00:47:10,032 --> 00:47:11,599
Fuck you!

789
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:17,039
Pick up, Wes!

790
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:29,717
This is Sheriff Hicks.

791
00:47:29,852 --> 00:47:31,586
I need units to converge
on my house ASAP.

792
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:34,089
<i>Copy that. We're on it.</i>

793
00:47:35,124 --> 00:47:37,225
<i>Can't get him
on the phone, can you?</i>

794
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:38,793
<i>He must be busy.</i>

795
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:41,130
How do I know
you're anywhere near him?

796
00:47:41,262 --> 00:47:44,165
<i>Ever seen the movie</i> Psycho?

797
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:56,879
Please...

798
00:47:58,047 --> 00:47:59,247
don't hurt my boy.

799
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,515
<i>Why not?</i>

800
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:03,785
- He's a good kid.
- <i>Is he, now?</i>

801
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:05,386
He never hurt anyone.

802
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,355
<i>That's not enough.</i>

803
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:09,657
Please! I'll do anything!

804
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:13,962
<i>You're not gonna
make it in time, Sheriff Judy.</i>

805
00:48:31,947 --> 00:48:32,948
Wes!

806
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:34,850
I'm coming!

807
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:36,819
Wes!

808
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:45,928
Help!

809
00:48:48,197 --> 00:48:49,731
Help!

810
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:21,522
Okay.

811
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,450
Mom?

812
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:47,175
Mom?

813
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:35,090
Fuck... you!

814
00:53:21,236 --> 00:53:23,604
Miss, you can't be here.
You can't be here.

815
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,073
No, I'm sorry.
I know her son.

816
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:28,542
- Her son, Wes. Is he...
- I'm sorry.

817
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:37,019
I'm sorry.

818
00:53:48,463 --> 00:53:49,965
Excuse me.

819
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,835
Oh, my God.

820
00:53:54,403 --> 00:53:55,504
You're...

821
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:58,006
Well, you're you.

822
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,573
Last time I checked.

823
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:03,644
Are you okay? You seem like
you're having a bit of a moment.

824
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:05,013
Did you know the sheriff?

825
00:54:06,081 --> 00:54:07,249
Sort of.

826
00:54:08,016 --> 00:54:09,851
She didn't like me very much.

827
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:11,652
She didn't like me either.

828
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:15,589
Um... I'm Samantha.
Sam. Carpenter.

829
00:54:15,723 --> 00:54:17,225
My sister and I were attacked.

830
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,395
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

831
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:22,164
I'm Gale...

832
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:27,969
Riley.

833
00:54:28,103 --> 00:54:30,939
Weathers. I'm Gale Weathers.
Excuse me.

834
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:34,642
Gale?

835
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:35,911
- A text?
- Ow.

836
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:37,645
You tell me the killer is back
in a text?

837
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,680
- Ow, that hurts.
- Good!

838
00:54:39,815 --> 00:54:42,583
- You were on the air.
- How do you know?

839
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:44,986
A hunch.

840
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,721
You look good.
Are you still writing?

841
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:50,158
No time.

842
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:52,227
You were always happiest
when you were writing.

843
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,429
Well, sir, it's okay.
We're here with Gale.

844
00:54:54,563 --> 00:54:57,598
I'd give you a hand,
but I can't release anybody right now.

845
00:54:57,731 --> 00:54:59,468
Couldn't resist a good story,
could you?

846
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,802
Don't be an idiot, Dewey.

847
00:55:00,936 --> 00:55:02,736
I'm here
because I was worried about you.

848
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:04,339
Okay, yes.

849
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:07,843
My producers wanted me to cover
this, for obvious reasons,

850
00:55:07,976 --> 00:55:10,078
but 90% is because of you.

851
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:12,780
Well, I feel 90% better.

852
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:14,549
Don't be so sensitive.

853
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:16,518
Since when did you care
about my feelings?

854
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,420
Especially not
in the last couple years.

855
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:21,423
All right, listen. Let's not pretend
I'm the one who ended things.

856
00:55:21,556 --> 00:55:25,127
No one's pretending, Gale.
I remember what happened.

857
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:28,830
Why aren't you in uniform?

858
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:31,133
I retired.

859
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:32,834
Since when?

860
00:55:33,902 --> 00:55:35,370
Since they asked me to.

861
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:37,671
Oh, Dewey.

862
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:39,773
I don't need your pity, Gale.

863
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:42,944
I made my choices.
So did you.

864
00:55:43,078 --> 00:55:46,047
It was my turn.
It was a great opportunity.

865
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:48,216
- You said you'd try.
- And I did.

866
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:49,284
For two whole months!

867
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:51,386
Listen, if you want to make me
feel worse

868
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,221
than I already do,
good luck.

869
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:56,591
The mornings aren't so bad,
'cause I get to see you.

870
00:55:56,757 --> 00:55:59,261
Pretend I'm still back there
in New York.

871
00:56:00,428 --> 00:56:01,930
But then I remember...

872
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:04,866
that I couldn't hack it.

873
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,068
I left
in the middle of the night...

874
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,204
like a coward.

875
00:56:09,938 --> 00:56:12,007
Why wouldn't you
tell me that then?

876
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:14,242
It would have mattered.

877
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:18,346
You are a lot of things,
Dewey...

878
00:56:19,814 --> 00:56:21,883
but you are not a coward.

879
00:56:22,417 --> 00:56:23,552
You just...

880
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:25,854
You just were meant to be
in Woodsboro.

881
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:28,023
And you weren't?

882
00:56:30,492 --> 00:56:32,793
Promise me you'll leave
as soon as you can.

883
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:34,795
You know I can't promise that.

884
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:41,136
I'm sorry about Judy.

885
00:56:42,204 --> 00:56:43,771
Yeah, me too.

886
00:56:45,373 --> 00:56:48,243
But she'll make a great chapter
in your next book.

887
00:56:50,512 --> 00:56:52,080
<i>And don't even get me started</i>

888
00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:54,249
<i>on Ghostface's
signature new weapon.</i>

889
00:56:54,382 --> 00:56:56,051
<i>That shit is lit.</i>

890
00:56:56,184 --> 00:56:58,687
<i>And can we talk about</i>
<i>the title?</i> Stab?

891
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,322
<i>What, just like the original?</i>

892
00:57:00,455 --> 00:57:02,624
<i>Just call it</i> Stab 8.
<i>It's fucking</i> Stab 8.

893
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:04,758
<i>You're not fooling anyone.</i>

894
00:57:04,893 --> 00:57:05,994
<i>It's such bullsh...</i>

895
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:07,662
<i>Where have you been? You okay?</i>

896
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:08,796
Yeah, I'm fine.

897
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:09,931
<i>That Mindy girl wasn't kidding.</i>

898
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:11,933
<i>Stab 8</i> is not like the others.

899
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:14,102
I mean, no connection
to the other movies.

900
00:57:14,236 --> 00:57:16,238
- No legacy characters at all.
- <i>Richie.</i>

901
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:18,807
If you ask me, this franchise goes
off the rails with number five.

902
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,245
Richie, listen to me.
He killed two more people.

903
00:57:23,378 --> 00:57:24,479
Wes and his mother.

904
00:57:24,613 --> 00:57:27,082
<i>He killed the sheriff?
You can do that?</i>

905
00:57:27,215 --> 00:57:29,584
<i>I mean, are you okay?
Where are you?</i>

906
00:57:30,485 --> 00:57:33,622
- I'll call you right back.
- <i>No, Sam...</i>

907
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:35,290
Who's at the hospital?

908
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,193
Who's watching my sister?

909
00:57:38,326 --> 00:57:40,362
I just heard about the sheriff.

910
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:43,565
They needed me here!

911
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:46,334
- Where are you going?
- My sister's in trouble!

912
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:51,172
...where Judy Hicks
has just been brutally murdered.

913
00:57:56,678 --> 00:57:59,780
What are you waiting for?
Drive!

914
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:02,183
Come on. Let's go!

915
00:58:02,317 --> 00:58:04,252
- <i>Are the doors locked?</i>
- <i>Yeah, we should check.</i>

916
00:58:04,386 --> 00:58:07,622
<i>Joey and Pacey, check the front door.
Jen and Cliff, get flashlights...</i>

917
00:58:10,892 --> 00:58:12,827
- <i>Where you going?</i>
- Hello?

918
00:58:12,961 --> 00:58:14,129
<i>You stay there.</i>

919
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:15,964
<i>No, I'm coming with you.</i>

920
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:17,732
<i>Okay.</i>

921
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:19,267
<i>He's got you.</i>

922
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:20,235
Hello?

923
00:58:20,368 --> 00:58:21,703
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

924
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,171
<i>Please. Quit tripping out.</i>

925
00:58:23,305 --> 00:58:25,240
<i>This is just Dawson
up to his old tired tricks.</i>

926
00:58:25,373 --> 00:58:27,075
<i>There's no psychopath
in this house.</i>

927
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,277
<i>Yes, there is.
And you brought her.</i>

928
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:31,212
Fuck this.

929
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:43,191
Fuck!

930
00:58:44,292 --> 00:58:45,327
Oh!

931
00:59:34,743 --> 00:59:36,144
Goddamn it!

932
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:38,012
Should you really be making
a phone call right now?

933
00:59:38,146 --> 00:59:40,148
Please, please.

934
01:00:07,776 --> 01:00:11,881
Stop! You know we have to live
through this to help her, right?

935
01:00:12,013 --> 01:00:13,181
Just hold on.

936
01:00:59,461 --> 01:01:02,363
Holy shit.

937
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,777
Ow! Ow.

938
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:18,246
- Goddamn it!
- Richie?

939
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:19,747
What are you doing here?

940
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:21,917
Sam called. She said that...

941
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,451
you were in trouble.

942
01:01:23,585 --> 01:01:25,987
- Did you hit me with the phone?
- Look out!

943
01:02:06,996 --> 01:02:08,329
Richie!

944
01:02:08,463 --> 01:02:11,065
- <i>Are you at the hospital?</i>
- Hello, Samantha.

945
01:02:12,066 --> 01:02:15,136
Richie can't come
to the phone right now.

946
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:16,906
He's finding out what happens
to people

947
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:20,141
who stick their noses in business
that doesn't concern them.

948
01:02:20,275 --> 01:02:23,344
- <i>Please don't hurt him.</i>
- Tell you what. You can choose.

949
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:25,213
I'll only kill one.

950
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:27,482
<i>What? What? Tera!</i>

951
01:02:27,615 --> 01:02:29,651
Who do you want to hear die?

952
01:02:29,784 --> 01:02:32,587
<i>No. Please! I'm begging you.
Please don't hurt them.</i>

953
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,622
Really?
You can't save your own sister?

954
01:02:34,756 --> 01:02:37,125
All you have to do is say,
"Kill Richie."

955
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:39,327
<i>No!</i>

956
01:02:40,128 --> 01:02:41,462
<i>Tara! Don't touch her!</i>

957
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:43,298
<i>Please, please, please.
I'm begging you.</i>

958
01:02:43,431 --> 01:02:45,034
Or say, "Kill Tara,"

959
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:48,770
and I'll make sure to hit all
the organs I missed last time.

960
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:50,405
- <i>No!</i>
- Fuck you!

961
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:53,107
<i>I'm begging you.
Please don't hurt her.</i>

962
01:02:53,241 --> 01:02:56,210
Last chance to save one.
Choose!

963
01:02:56,344 --> 01:02:58,780
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

964
01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:00,481
You want to know why, Sam?

965
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:02,517
Maybe it's because
you're a selfish bitch

966
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:06,454
who can't even make a decision to
save the life of someone you love.

967
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:11,060
Maybe you're too weak
for this franchise.

968
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:13,461
<i>Maybe you're right.</i>

969
01:03:14,562 --> 01:03:16,932
<i>Or maybe I'm just
stalling for time, fuckhead.</i>

970
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:23,839
I'll get Richie.

971
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:25,239
Tara!

972
01:03:26,274 --> 01:03:27,609
Oh, my God!

973
01:03:30,244 --> 01:03:31,379
Come on.

974
01:03:31,512 --> 01:03:33,314
It's okay. I got you.

975
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:36,819
It's gonna be all right.

976
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:39,888
Get the elevator!

977
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:04,345
Not today.

978
01:04:18,894 --> 01:04:20,194
Richie.

979
01:04:28,971 --> 01:04:30,806
- Come on, hurry up.
- Oh!

980
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:34,642
- The head.
- What?

981
01:04:34,776 --> 01:04:37,245
You have to shoot 'em in the
head, or they always come back.

982
01:04:37,378 --> 01:04:39,614
Dewey!
Who gives a fuck?

983
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:42,684
- I do.
- No! Dewey!

984
01:05:21,689 --> 01:05:23,926
Yes, today.

985
01:05:45,546 --> 01:05:47,582
It's an honor.

986
01:06:31,827 --> 01:06:33,294
No!

987
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:36,297
No! No!

988
01:07:16,171 --> 01:07:17,538
I'm sorry.

989
01:07:20,408 --> 01:07:22,410
I didn't know him well, but...

990
01:07:23,511 --> 01:07:24,745
he helped me.

991
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:28,884
That's what he did.

992
01:07:29,017 --> 01:07:30,351
He helped people.

993
01:07:31,686 --> 01:07:33,421
I should've stopped him.

994
01:07:34,755 --> 01:07:37,025
If you had,
my sister would be dead.

995
01:07:40,128 --> 01:07:42,931
Samantha, your sister's awake.

996
01:08:00,381 --> 01:08:01,716
Gale.

997
01:08:02,184 --> 01:08:03,384
Sidney.

998
01:08:06,288 --> 01:08:07,823
I came as soon as I heard.

999
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:12,828
I'm so sorry.

1000
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:24,405
You shouldn't be here.

1001
01:08:24,538 --> 01:08:26,141
You shouldn't be here either.

1002
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:31,246
- Mark and the kids are okay?
- Yeah, they're safe for now.

1003
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:33,781
I'm here to make sure of that.

1004
01:08:35,284 --> 01:08:36,517
Come here.

1005
01:08:50,232 --> 01:08:51,266
How you feeling?

1006
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,868
Every time I get attacked,

1007
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:54,870
they give me better painkillers.

1008
01:08:55,503 --> 01:08:57,039
So there's that.

1009
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:01,143
I'm sorry.

1010
01:09:01,276 --> 01:09:03,211
For what?
You saved my life.

1011
01:09:06,815 --> 01:09:08,749
For not telling you
sooner.

1012
01:09:10,252 --> 01:09:11,853
For being the reason Dad left.

1013
01:09:11,987 --> 01:09:13,889
You're not the reason Dad left.

1014
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:17,692
You didn't choose where you
came from. Or who you came from.

1015
01:09:17,826 --> 01:09:19,560
I don't blame you for that.

1016
01:09:21,396 --> 01:09:23,265
I blame you for leaving me too.

1017
01:09:23,398 --> 01:09:25,934
That's never gonna happen again.

1018
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:28,870
I know.

1019
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:32,640
But why didn't you
come to me back then?

1020
01:09:32,773 --> 01:09:34,810
I could've helped.

1021
01:09:34,943 --> 01:09:36,111
Because...

1022
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:39,982
I was scared.

1023
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:42,050
Of what?

1024
01:09:43,285 --> 01:09:46,989
I was scared that I would
turn out just like him.

1025
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,657
So I ran.

1026
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:52,427
To protect you.

1027
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,162
From me.

1028
01:09:54,997 --> 01:09:56,031
Sam...

1029
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:59,167
you could never be like him.

1030
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:08,377
- You're so high right now.
- I'm so high right now.

1031
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:11,013
I'm not even gonna lie.

1032
01:10:15,283 --> 01:10:16,852
I love you.

1033
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:19,054
I love you too.

1034
01:10:22,757 --> 01:10:24,092
So what do we do now?

1035
01:10:25,093 --> 01:10:28,230
What nobody ever does
in these situations.

1036
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:32,566
We're gonna get the fuck
out of Woodsboro.

1037
01:10:39,307 --> 01:10:40,876
- That's her?
- Yeah.

1038
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:45,080
Samantha?

1039
01:10:47,748 --> 01:10:48,749
It's Sam.

1040
01:10:48,884 --> 01:10:50,785
- I'm...
- I know who you are.

1041
01:10:52,686 --> 01:10:54,156
I hope you're okay.

1042
01:10:55,057 --> 01:10:57,725
- Listen, I'm sorry...
- You're Billy's daughter.

1043
01:10:59,428 --> 01:11:01,263
We'll bring the car around.

1044
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,935
Yeah. I'm his daughter.

1045
01:11:07,668 --> 01:11:09,371
I'm sorry
if that's weird for you.

1046
01:11:09,504 --> 01:11:11,239
No, no, it's...

1047
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,811
I've been through this.
A lot.

1048
01:11:16,545 --> 01:11:17,846
You want to talk?

1049
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:20,148
I appreciate it.

1050
01:11:21,249 --> 01:11:22,384
And I'm...

1051
01:11:22,984 --> 01:11:25,253
I'm really sorry about Dewey.

1052
01:11:25,387 --> 01:11:28,156
But I'm taking my sister away
from all this.

1053
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:32,760
I tried running too.

1054
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:34,662
It doesn't work,
it always follows.

1055
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:36,597
All due respect,
that's your life, not mine.

1056
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:39,401
- I'm not so sure about that.
- What do you want from me, lady?

1057
01:11:39,534 --> 01:11:41,803
Hey! Watch your tone,
new girl.

1058
01:11:41,937 --> 01:11:44,738
You know how they always say
it goes back to the original?

1059
01:11:44,873 --> 01:11:46,374
Here's the original.

1060
01:11:46,508 --> 01:11:47,843
I want your help.

1061
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:49,377
Because you're wrong,
this is your life now.

1062
01:11:49,511 --> 01:11:52,080
Which means whoever this is
will keep coming for you.

1063
01:11:52,214 --> 01:11:54,416
- So?
- So I want you to help us kill him.

1064
01:11:54,549 --> 01:11:59,787
You want me to help you and the host
of a morning show commit murder?

1065
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:00,956
- Correct.
- Yeah.

1066
01:12:01,089 --> 01:12:03,657
And I'm what
in this scenario?

1067
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:06,194
The bait?
The helpless victim?

1068
01:12:06,328 --> 01:12:09,197
- If the shoe fits...
- You're not helpless, Sam.

1069
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:11,333
He killed your friend,
he killed ours.

1070
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:14,668
And I have kids, which means I won't
sleep until he's in the ground.

1071
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:18,940
Look, I'm sorry about what
this has done to your lives.

1072
01:12:19,074 --> 01:12:22,477
But no matter what you
or the killer or anyone says,

1073
01:12:22,611 --> 01:12:24,312
this isn't my story.

1074
01:12:24,446 --> 01:12:25,580
All right!

1075
01:12:25,713 --> 01:12:27,415
Let's get the fuck out of town,
huh?

1076
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:30,385
Sorry.
That's my boyfriend, Richie.

1077
01:12:30,519 --> 01:12:32,220
Nice to meet... We met.

1078
01:12:32,354 --> 01:12:34,890
Sam, please get in the car so we
never have to see these people again.

1079
01:12:35,023 --> 01:12:38,193
- Sam...
- No. We're leaving.

1080
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,694
That's the only way
I can protect Tara.

1081
01:12:42,297 --> 01:12:43,331
Okay, good luck.

1082
01:12:47,102 --> 01:12:48,203
You too.

1083
01:12:53,008 --> 01:12:54,409
Well,
that went fucking horribly.

1084
01:12:54,543 --> 01:12:57,078
Don't worry, I have a plan.
She seems really tough.

1085
01:12:57,212 --> 01:12:59,414
Honestly, Sid,
who gives a shit?

1086
01:12:59,548 --> 01:13:01,483
You said it yourself,
he's gonna go after her.

1087
01:13:01,616 --> 01:13:03,018
I put a tracker
on her car.

1088
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:04,752
- You did what?
- It seemed like something

1089
01:13:04,886 --> 01:13:06,720
Gale Weathers would do.

1090
01:13:06,855 --> 01:13:09,090
Take that as a compliment.

1091
01:13:10,592 --> 01:13:13,428
I left a message for Mom.
I told her where we're going.

1092
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:18,633
Fuck, where is it?

1093
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:19,968
Where's what?

1094
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:22,470
My inhaler.
I usually keep an extra one.

1095
01:13:23,538 --> 01:13:24,472
Should we go back?

1096
01:13:24,606 --> 01:13:25,907
Whoa. Okay.

1097
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:27,976
I vote for not going back
to the murder hospital.

1098
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:30,312
- You want to stop at a pharmacy?
- I'd need a prescription.

1099
01:13:30,445 --> 01:13:32,713
But I left an extra one
at Amber's.

1100
01:13:32,847 --> 01:13:35,749
- Her house is on the way.
- No. No. No, no, no.

1101
01:13:35,884 --> 01:13:37,118
I'd be in and out.

1102
01:13:37,252 --> 01:13:38,786
Could you hold out
till Modesto?

1103
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,022
- I don't think so.
- Okay, what's the address?

1104
01:13:41,156 --> 01:13:42,824
123 No Fucking Way Lane.

1105
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:44,626
Richie, she needs it.

1106
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:48,263
And I need to keep all the
blood inside my body. So do you.

1107
01:13:48,396 --> 01:13:49,331
Richie, please.

1108
01:13:50,465 --> 01:13:51,765
It's okay.

1109
01:13:53,301 --> 01:13:56,404
Okay, yeah. Fuck.
What's the goddamn address?

1110
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:18,526
Keep pouring, Wheeler.
Thank you.

1111
01:14:19,427 --> 01:14:20,428
Hey.

1112
01:14:20,562 --> 01:14:21,630
To Wes!

1113
01:14:21,762 --> 01:14:23,431
To Wes!

1114
01:14:23,565 --> 01:14:24,866
Beautiful son of a bitch.

1115
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,334
We love you, buddy!

1116
01:14:26,468 --> 01:14:28,837
Shots, really?
This is supposed to be a memorial.

1117
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,438
Well, this is how I mourn

1118
01:14:30,572 --> 01:14:34,843
and distract myself from
the looming specter of Death.

1119
01:14:34,976 --> 01:14:36,478
Hey, we're low on beer.

1120
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:39,114
There's more in the basement.
I'll go get some.

1121
01:15:18,753 --> 01:15:21,623
What the fuck, Mindy?
Jesus!

1122
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:23,558
That was a test.
And you failed.

1123
01:15:23,692 --> 01:15:26,127
Never go off on your own
with a masked killer around.

1124
01:15:26,261 --> 01:15:28,163
You're the one that said
we needed more beer.

1125
01:15:28,296 --> 01:15:30,332
And you should have asked me
to come with you.

1126
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,002
You know what else
you shouldn't do

1127
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:35,704
when there's
a masked killer around?

1128
01:15:35,837 --> 01:15:37,339
What?

1129
01:15:37,472 --> 01:15:42,077
Follow someone into
a dark, creepy basement alone.

1130
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:44,846
I mean...

1131
01:15:46,548 --> 01:15:48,149
...how do you know
I'm not the killer?

1132
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,088
Because I am.

1133
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:58,126
I'm not, actually.

1134
01:15:58,259 --> 01:16:02,764
But let that be a lesson.
Don't trust anyone.

1135
01:16:02,897 --> 01:16:06,401
Then how can I trust you when
you say you're not the killer?

1136
01:16:06,534 --> 01:16:07,635
Exactly.

1137
01:16:08,737 --> 01:16:09,771
You're learning.

1138
01:16:10,405 --> 01:16:12,006
Now let's go back
upstairs.

1139
01:16:19,414 --> 01:16:20,448
You first.

1140
01:16:21,817 --> 01:16:23,051
Very good.

1141
01:16:33,863 --> 01:16:37,198
I think... Think I'm ready.

1142
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:40,101
I mean, I think we should.

1143
01:16:40,235 --> 01:16:43,271
Like now.
You want to go upstairs?

1144
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:45,373
Like... Like upstairs?

1145
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:47,342
Uh-huh. Right now.

1146
01:16:48,777 --> 01:16:50,145
Um...

1147
01:16:51,946 --> 01:16:56,718
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I think I have to pass on that.

1148
01:16:57,185 --> 01:16:58,420
What?

1149
01:17:00,522 --> 01:17:01,723
Why?

1150
01:17:03,591 --> 01:17:09,297
You know, I'm not like entirely
sure that you're not the...

1151
01:17:10,398 --> 01:17:11,433
killer.

1152
01:17:11,566 --> 01:17:13,401
"Don't take this
the wrong way"?

1153
01:17:13,535 --> 01:17:17,807
No, no, look. I'm almost 100%
certain that you are not,

1154
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:21,743
but the safest option
is to be down here

1155
01:17:21,877 --> 01:17:22,878
with all the people...

1156
01:17:23,011 --> 01:17:24,312
Fuck you.

1157
01:17:24,446 --> 01:17:25,815
...and the potential witnesses.

1158
01:17:25,947 --> 01:17:28,583
That is a completely valid
emotional response to have.

1159
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:31,553
- That too.
- Fucking asshole.

1160
01:17:32,922 --> 01:17:34,155
Good job.

1161
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:36,892
Fuck you, Mindy.

1162
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:40,863
If I hadn't have written
that book about your mother,

1163
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:43,064
- none of this would've happened.
- Gale.

1164
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:46,201
- I started all of this.
- No, you didn't.

1165
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:49,437
Billy Loomis started this,
and we're gonna end it.

1166
01:17:50,104 --> 01:17:51,439
After tonight,
no more books,

1167
01:17:51,573 --> 01:17:55,009
no more movies,
no more fucking Ghostface.

1168
01:17:55,143 --> 01:17:58,079
- <i>Don't you know the rules?</i>
- <i>What rules?</i>

1169
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,718
<i>There are specific rules</i>

1170
01:18:03,853 --> 01:18:07,655
<i>that one must abide by to
successfully survive a horror movie.</i>

1171
01:18:07,789 --> 01:18:08,790
<i>For instance,</i>

1172
01:18:08,924 --> 01:18:10,325
<i>number one...</i>

1173
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:13,094
Don't do it.
Don't go outside after her.

1174
01:18:13,228 --> 01:18:14,262
She's not texting me back.

1175
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:15,663
Because she's probably dead.

1176
01:18:15,797 --> 01:18:16,966
Jesus, Mindy.

1177
01:18:17,098 --> 01:18:18,633
That's my girlfriend,
and I love her.

1178
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:20,568
Was your girlfriend.

1179
01:18:20,702 --> 01:18:22,737
You're just gonna sit and watch a
movie about our uncle getting stabbed?

1180
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:25,473
It calms me down, okay?
I'm also gonna smoke some weed

1181
01:18:25,607 --> 01:18:28,176
and possibly
hook up with Frances.

1182
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:30,645
Have fun.

1183
01:18:30,778 --> 01:18:33,448
Oh, my God, at least take
some sort of weapon.

1184
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,250
Here you go.

1185
01:18:49,097 --> 01:18:50,431
All right.

1186
01:18:54,003 --> 01:18:56,805
What?

1187
01:19:04,212 --> 01:19:06,214
Ah.

1188
01:19:19,627 --> 01:19:20,795
Liv?

1189
01:19:26,401 --> 01:19:27,602
Liv?

1190
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,795
All right.
Okay, yeah, no.

1191
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:56,598
Shit!

1192
01:20:06,774 --> 01:20:08,743
Fuck!

1193
01:20:32,433 --> 01:20:34,736
Please, please, please.

1194
01:21:07,769 --> 01:21:09,138
Whoa! Stop! Wait!

1195
01:21:22,717 --> 01:21:25,486
Oh, perfect.
She's having a party.

1196
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,622
Who has a party in the
middle of a killing spree?

1197
01:21:27,755 --> 01:21:30,025
- Look, I'm aborting the plan.
- No, we're already here.

1198
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,961
I'll go in quickly and get it.
I'll be back in five.

1199
01:21:33,095 --> 01:21:34,195
I'm coming too.

1200
01:21:34,328 --> 01:21:35,864
If you think I'm waiting
out here

1201
01:21:35,998 --> 01:21:38,433
just to get murdered,
you're out of your mind.

1202
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:49,912
Tara!

1203
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:53,082
What are you doing
out of the hospital?

1204
01:21:53,214 --> 01:21:54,649
Should you even be up
and around?

1205
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:57,552
- I need my spare inhaler.
- Why? Where are you going?

1206
01:22:00,788 --> 01:22:04,392
It's fine. Don't tell me.
I get it. Just be safe, okay?

1207
01:22:05,426 --> 01:22:07,261
I think it's in my room.

1208
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:09,564
All right, everyone!

1209
01:22:09,697 --> 01:22:12,600
Thanks for coming,
but the party's over!

1210
01:22:13,434 --> 01:22:14,635
- Time to go!
- Why?

1211
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:17,106
But it's so early!

1212
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:18,606
Let's go.

1213
01:22:20,575 --> 01:22:24,079
Hey, hey, hey! Hello!
Can we cut the music, please?

1214
01:22:25,379 --> 01:22:28,516
Uh, hi... Gen Z.
How are you? Um...

1215
01:22:28,649 --> 01:22:32,386
Both Sam and Tara here have been
attacked by the killer twice.

1216
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:36,390
And now they're here, which makes
this place a huge murder target, so...

1217
01:22:36,524 --> 01:22:38,426
if I were you,
I would probably leave.

1218
01:22:39,928 --> 01:22:41,429
Okay, I tried to be nice.
Get the fuck out!

1219
01:22:41,562 --> 01:22:43,331
Please get the fuck out.

1220
01:22:43,464 --> 01:22:45,600
- Sincerely, get the fuck out.
- Buzzkill!

1221
01:22:45,733 --> 01:22:47,535
Thank you. Thank you all.

1222
01:22:47,668 --> 01:22:50,505
I'm saving your life. I promise.

1223
01:22:50,638 --> 01:22:54,275
Thanks, teens.

1224
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:56,044
Thank you so much.

1225
01:22:56,178 --> 01:22:58,646
Thank you for leaving the cup.

1226
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,082
Thank you.

1227
01:23:00,215 --> 01:23:01,649
Saving your life.

1228
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:03,785
I'm saving your life.

1229
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,822
Saving your life, thank you.

1230
01:23:07,923 --> 01:23:09,624
<i>And number three:</i>

1231
01:23:09,757 --> 01:23:12,161
<i>Never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances,</i>

1232
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:14,129
<i>say, "I'll be right back."</i>

1233
01:23:14,263 --> 01:23:15,964
<i>'Cause you won't be back.</i>

1234
01:23:16,098 --> 01:23:19,101
Hey,
somebody's goofy-ass dad's kicking us out.

1235
01:23:19,234 --> 01:23:20,635
Goddamn it.

1236
01:23:20,768 --> 01:23:21,602
Thank you.

1237
01:23:21,736 --> 01:23:23,337
Thanks, guys,
have a good night.

1238
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:24,772
- You have my number.
- Bye.

1239
01:23:24,907 --> 01:23:26,641
Bye.

1240
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:39,121
Hi. Uh...

1241
01:23:39,254 --> 01:23:41,656
Is there any beer left?
There's none in the kitchen.

1242
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:44,725
Yes, Richie,
there's beer in the basement.

1243
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:47,562
Right behind you.
Basement.

1244
01:23:47,996 --> 01:23:48,864
Yeah.

1245
01:23:48,997 --> 01:23:50,933
Do you want to, uh,
come with me?

1246
01:23:51,066 --> 01:23:54,102
No. But you were right to ask.

1247
01:23:54,236 --> 01:23:56,337
Yeah. Um...

1248
01:23:57,806 --> 01:23:59,842
Okay, I'll be right back...
Aha!

1249
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:03,912
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

1250
01:24:05,013 --> 01:24:06,581
Well, he's dead.

1251
01:24:07,782 --> 01:24:09,885
The goddamn fucking Uber
canceled on me!

1252
01:24:10,018 --> 01:24:10,953
Great.

1253
01:24:11,086 --> 01:24:12,553
Now I can't have sex,

1254
01:24:12,687 --> 01:24:14,388
and I can't get a ride home.

1255
01:24:14,522 --> 01:24:17,125
Could this night
get any shittier?

1256
01:24:17,259 --> 01:24:19,228
Liv, where's my brother?

1257
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,863
What? I don't know, Mindy.

1258
01:24:20,996 --> 01:24:23,664
Probably off accusing everyone
of being the killer!

1259
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:26,601
He actually went looking
for you.

1260
01:24:27,903 --> 01:24:30,038
I didn't see him.
Okay?

1261
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,975
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1262
01:24:33,909 --> 01:24:36,845
Just revising my suspect list.

1263
01:24:39,547 --> 01:24:40,816
Fuck this!

1264
01:24:47,622 --> 01:24:49,724
Are you afraid of me,
Mindy?

1265
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:55,563
You think I did something
to your brother? Huh?

1266
01:24:55,696 --> 01:24:58,666
You think I'm gonna...
cut you up?

1267
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:02,536
A little bit now...
yeah.

1268
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:06,540
I thought you said I was
too boring to be the killer.

1269
01:25:06,674 --> 01:25:09,144
Maybe that's the twist.

1270
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:14,415
What do you think, huh?
You're the expert.

1271
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:19,922
You know what eventually happens
to the expert?

1272
01:25:20,822 --> 01:25:21,957
What?

1273
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:29,998
Enjoy your stupid movie.

1274
01:25:32,433 --> 01:25:35,370
Fucking psycho.

1275
01:25:35,503 --> 01:25:37,005
They stopped.

1276
01:25:37,139 --> 01:25:39,174
- Gas station?
- No. I...

1277
01:25:39,308 --> 01:25:41,575
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1278
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:46,547
Oh, shit. How far are we?

1279
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:48,317
Too far.

1280
01:25:48,449 --> 01:25:49,650
Damn it.

1281
01:25:49,784 --> 01:25:51,954
Tara, we're leaving!

1282
01:25:57,591 --> 01:25:58,793
Hello.

1283
01:25:58,927 --> 01:26:00,594
You need to get out
of that house right now.

1284
01:26:00,728 --> 01:26:01,729
How do you know where I am?

1285
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:03,497
You're in Stu Macher's house,

1286
01:26:03,631 --> 01:26:04,866
<i>where your dad and Stu
killed everyone.</i>

1287
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,401
<i>Someone planned
to get you there.</i>

1288
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:08,536
<i>You need to get the fuck out,
Sam!</i>

1289
01:26:16,477 --> 01:26:18,512
<i>No, Jamie. Watch out.</i>

1290
01:26:18,646 --> 01:26:20,849
<i>Watch out, Jamie.</i>

1291
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:22,985
<i>You know he's around.</i>

1292
01:26:23,819 --> 01:26:25,020
- What?
- <i>There he is.</i>

1293
01:26:25,153 --> 01:26:29,124
Come on, man, turn around!
Turn around! Dude!

1294
01:26:29,257 --> 01:26:30,926
<i>I told you.</i>

1295
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:33,728
<i>I told you, he's around the corner.
Jamie.</i>

1296
01:26:33,862 --> 01:26:36,832
- <i>Look behind you.</i>
- No, Randy, look behind you.

1297
01:26:36,965 --> 01:26:38,834
Come on, man,
turn around!

1298
01:26:38,967 --> 01:26:42,304
Dude, what are you doing?
You can do it!

1299
01:26:42,437 --> 01:26:45,374
These are your rules!
Own that shit.

1300
01:26:45,506 --> 01:26:47,442
<i>Behind you! Turn around.</i>

1301
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:49,710
Look behind...

1302
01:26:51,313 --> 01:26:52,613
Oh, shit!

1303
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:13,701
- Mindy.
- That's a lot of blood, Sam.

1304
01:27:13,835 --> 01:27:15,837
No, Mindy, stay with me.

1305
01:27:15,971 --> 01:27:18,807
What did you do to her?

1306
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:20,942
Nothing.
No, I didn't do anything.

1307
01:27:21,076 --> 01:27:23,378
- The killer, he...
- Mindy!

1308
01:27:23,812 --> 01:27:24,745
What the fuck?

1309
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,348
Richie, where the fuck were you?

1310
01:27:26,481 --> 01:27:27,816
I went into the basement
to get beer.

1311
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:29,084
You went to the basement alone?

1312
01:27:29,217 --> 01:27:30,919
I asked her to come with me!
She said no!

1313
01:27:31,053 --> 01:27:32,521
Fuck!

1314
01:27:32,653 --> 01:27:34,022
Stay the fuck back.

1315
01:27:34,156 --> 01:27:35,290
Jesus Christ!

1316
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,590
I was with Tara,

1317
01:27:36,724 --> 01:27:38,026
but the rest of you
were wandering around.

1318
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,727
One of you
is the fucking killer!

1319
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:42,297
Fuck you, Amber. Fuck you!

1320
01:27:42,431 --> 01:27:43,932
Why is there blood
on your hands?

1321
01:27:44,066 --> 01:27:45,133
What?

1322
01:27:47,235 --> 01:27:48,136
I found Chad.

1323
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:50,372
- I found Chad and he's...
- Chad?

1324
01:27:50,505 --> 01:27:52,740
- You're fucking lying.
- No.

1325
01:27:52,874 --> 01:27:54,910
- You're the killer.
- No, I'm not.

1326
01:27:55,043 --> 01:27:55,977
Liv, stop.

1327
01:27:56,111 --> 01:27:58,180
- Fuck you!
- Liv, just stop!

1328
01:27:58,313 --> 01:28:02,050
Fuck you, Amber.
I'm not the fucking killer!

1329
01:28:02,184 --> 01:28:03,285
I know.

1330
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,956
Welcome to act three.

1331
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:09,224
Run!

1332
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,527
Holy shit!

1333
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,962
- Sam, come on!
- No...

1334
01:28:14,096 --> 01:28:16,865
Run! Go, go, go! Go!

1335
01:28:18,366 --> 01:28:19,700
Oh, my God.
Holy shit!

1336
01:28:19,835 --> 01:28:21,937
- Oh, my God... Tara!
- Wait, no, Sam.

1337
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:23,004
- She has a gun.
- Richie.

1338
01:28:23,138 --> 01:28:25,673
There are always
two killers.

1339
01:28:34,015 --> 01:28:36,184
Sam, please put the knife down.

1340
01:28:38,253 --> 01:28:39,821
Look, I think...

1341
01:28:39,955 --> 01:28:42,224
- The other killer might be Tara.
- What?

1342
01:28:42,357 --> 01:28:43,791
She's the one
that brought us here,

1343
01:28:43,925 --> 01:28:46,061
and you two have been
estranged for years.

1344
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:48,930
I mean,

1345
01:28:49,663 --> 01:28:51,665
how well
do you really know her?

1346
01:28:51,799 --> 01:28:53,301
Better than I know you.

1347
01:28:56,438 --> 01:28:58,273
Sam, wait, whoa. Sam!

1348
01:29:14,788 --> 01:29:16,291
Sounds about right.

1349
01:29:16,825 --> 01:29:17,791
You ready?

1350
01:29:17,926 --> 01:29:19,995
For this? Never.

1351
01:29:20,694 --> 01:29:22,030
Here we go.

1352
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:31,640
Help me, help me! He stabbed me!

1353
01:29:31,772 --> 01:29:33,542
- What do you think?
- Trap.

1354
01:29:33,674 --> 01:29:35,177
Fuck it.

1355
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:36,378
Ow!

1356
01:29:38,746 --> 01:29:40,315
Gale! Gale!

1357
01:29:40,448 --> 01:29:41,715
Wait. Let me see.

1358
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:42,884
Let me see.

1359
01:29:43,018 --> 01:29:45,253
- You got to go to the hospital.
- No.

1360
01:29:45,387 --> 01:29:48,689
You said we were gonna finish
this. Go finish it, Sidney.

1361
01:29:49,324 --> 01:29:50,525
Gale.

1362
01:29:50,892 --> 01:29:52,127
For Dewey.

1363
01:30:32,901 --> 01:30:34,603
Anyone hiding,
killer or not,

1364
01:30:34,735 --> 01:30:37,239
you have five seconds
to show yourself!

1365
01:31:10,939 --> 01:31:12,240
Oh, Tara.

1366
01:31:12,374 --> 01:31:13,408
Oh, my God.

1367
01:31:21,683 --> 01:31:23,251
Sam.

1368
01:31:23,885 --> 01:31:25,253
Sam, please.

1369
01:31:35,096 --> 01:31:37,666
<i>Hello, Sidney!</i>

1370
01:31:37,798 --> 01:31:39,901
Hello there.
Where'd you go?

1371
01:31:40,035 --> 01:31:43,538
<i>Oh, this isn't Amber.
I'm the other one.</i>

1372
01:31:44,172 --> 01:31:47,575
Oh. There's two of you. Again.

1373
01:31:47,709 --> 01:31:49,277
I've seen this movie before.

1374
01:31:49,411 --> 01:31:51,179
<i>Not this movie, Sidney.</i>

1375
01:31:51,313 --> 01:31:53,515
You really need
some new material.

1376
01:31:54,549 --> 01:31:57,218
<i>I got you here, didn't I?</i>

1377
01:31:57,352 --> 01:31:59,688
You might actually be
the most derivative one of all.

1378
01:31:59,821 --> 01:32:01,222
I mean, Christ,
the same house?

1379
01:32:01,356 --> 01:32:03,625
<i>Maybe so.
But you forgot the first rule</i>

1380
01:32:03,758 --> 01:32:05,660
<i>of surviving a</i> Stab <i>movie.</i>

1381
01:32:05,794 --> 01:32:06,795
<i>Never answer the...</i>

1382
01:32:06,928 --> 01:32:08,563
- I'm bored.
- <i>Wait!</i>

1383
01:32:12,934 --> 01:32:14,502
Put your hands up!
Show me your hands!

1384
01:32:14,636 --> 01:32:16,037
What are you doing in there?

1385
01:32:16,171 --> 01:32:18,373
- Hiding from murderers.
- I told you to come out!

1386
01:32:18,506 --> 01:32:21,509
I'm not gonna come out!
You're shooting everything!

1387
01:32:22,177 --> 01:32:24,312
Holy shit,
it's Ghostface!

1388
01:32:40,161 --> 01:32:42,030
Richie! Gun. Get the gun.

1389
01:32:42,163 --> 01:32:44,566
Yeah, kind of hard
since you shot me in the leg.

1390
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:46,968
Fuck. Fuck.

1391
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:57,278
- Yes! Yes!
- Shoot him!

1392
01:33:00,048 --> 01:33:01,216
Thank God you're okay.

1393
01:33:05,186 --> 01:33:07,122
'Cause I really,

1394
01:33:07,255 --> 01:33:09,624
really wanted to be
the one to kill you.

1395
01:33:13,829 --> 01:33:15,563
Sit the fuck down, Prescott!

1396
01:33:37,452 --> 01:33:40,054
I can't believe this worked.

1397
01:33:44,492 --> 01:33:47,362
I know.
It's a bummer it's me.

1398
01:33:51,065 --> 01:33:55,136
But it really was
the best choice for the movie.

1399
01:33:56,204 --> 01:33:58,540
This isn't a fucking movie!

1400
01:33:59,641 --> 01:34:01,576
No. But it will be.

1401
01:34:02,777 --> 01:34:05,580
- That's the point, right, Amber?
- Right, hon!

1402
01:34:05,713 --> 01:34:09,517
Third act bloodbath, check.
Killers revealed, check.

1403
01:34:09,651 --> 01:34:11,486
Time for the big finale!

1404
01:34:14,189 --> 01:34:16,558
- Richie...
- Shh, shh...

1405
01:34:17,992 --> 01:34:20,028
Okay. Okay.

1406
01:34:20,161 --> 01:34:21,596
Let's get 'em
into the kitchen.

1407
01:34:23,131 --> 01:34:24,332
Let's go, bitch!

1408
01:34:24,466 --> 01:34:26,568
Someone has to
save the franchise.

1409
01:34:26,701 --> 01:34:31,606
You see, no one has made a great
<i>Stab</i> movie since the first one.

1410
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:33,107
Not really.

1411
01:34:33,241 --> 01:34:34,476
Hey, baby, you want to go get

1412
01:34:34,609 --> 01:34:37,979
- the very ex-Mrs. Riley?
- Yeah, I do.

1413
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,048
Hey, hey!

1414
01:34:40,181 --> 01:34:42,717
Whoa... whoa.

1415
01:34:43,819 --> 01:34:45,053
Sidney Prescott.

1416
01:34:45,186 --> 01:34:46,988
You know...

1417
01:34:48,223 --> 01:34:49,557
I'm a really big fan.

1418
01:34:49,691 --> 01:34:50,458
Go fuck yourself.

1419
01:34:50,592 --> 01:34:52,393
You see the last <i>Stab</i> movie?

1420
01:34:52,527 --> 01:34:54,262
Not really a fan
of scary movies.

1421
01:34:54,395 --> 01:34:56,631
That checks out.
Anyway, it sucked balls.

1422
01:34:56,764 --> 01:34:59,067
Because nobody takes
the true fans seriously.

1423
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,668
Not really.

1424
01:35:01,302 --> 01:35:03,806
They just laugh at us, and why?

1425
01:35:03,939 --> 01:35:05,975
Because we love something?

1426
01:35:06,107 --> 01:35:08,009
We're just a fucking joke
to them?

1427
01:35:08,911 --> 01:35:12,547
How can fandom be toxic?

1428
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:14,282
It's about love!

1429
01:35:14,415 --> 01:35:17,987
They don't fucking understand that
these movies are important to people.

1430
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:19,787
- Richie...
- We're gonna help them!

1431
01:35:20,622 --> 01:35:22,925
Hollywood's
totally fucking out of ideas,

1432
01:35:23,057 --> 01:35:26,361
so we decided we'd give them some
new source material to follow.

1433
01:35:26,494 --> 01:35:28,329
You know,
bring it back to basics.

1434
01:35:28,463 --> 01:35:30,698
Because that's how you make
a great <i>Stab</i> movie, Sam.

1435
01:35:31,766 --> 01:35:33,768
"Based on actual events."

1436
01:35:36,005 --> 01:35:37,272
- Gale.
- Shh, shh.

1437
01:35:37,405 --> 01:35:40,108
Back up. Back up.

1438
01:35:45,346 --> 01:35:47,850
You did all this
just to make me the hero

1439
01:35:47,983 --> 01:35:49,217
of your fucked-up movie?

1440
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:52,487
Sweetie, you're not the hero.

1441
01:35:54,422 --> 01:35:56,190
You're the villain.

1442
01:35:56,859 --> 01:35:58,027
The daughter of Billy Loomis

1443
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,295
who sees fucked-up visions
of her dead dad?

1444
01:36:00,428 --> 01:36:02,463
Sidney Prescott
killed your father.

1445
01:36:02,597 --> 01:36:03,798
You...

1446
01:36:03,933 --> 01:36:07,735
did all this just to get her
back to Woodsboro.

1447
01:36:09,004 --> 01:36:10,438
You know what the biggest
problem

1448
01:36:10,572 --> 01:36:12,574
with the <i>Stab</i> movies is?

1449
01:36:12,707 --> 01:36:15,878
There's no Michael Myers
or Jason Voorhees.

1450
01:36:16,011 --> 01:36:18,713
No bad guy to keep coming back.

1451
01:36:18,847 --> 01:36:22,150
But the illegitimate daughter
of the original mastermind?

1452
01:36:22,283 --> 01:36:24,619
Now that's a fucking villain.

1453
01:36:24,752 --> 01:36:27,689
- How did you know?
- About your father?

1454
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:32,093
It's a small town,
and your mom's a drunk!

1455
01:36:32,226 --> 01:36:35,163
I met Richie
on the <i>Stab</i> subreddit.

1456
01:36:35,296 --> 01:36:39,500
I've been obsessed ever since
my parents bought this house.

1457
01:36:39,634 --> 01:36:42,337
We realized pretty quickly
we had similar ideas.

1458
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,907
Wasn't that hard for me
to find you in Modesto.

1459
01:36:45,808 --> 01:36:48,109
It wasn't that hard for me
to fuck you, either.

1460
01:36:48,242 --> 01:36:49,611
But I guess
being a sexually available woman

1461
01:36:49,744 --> 01:36:51,646
is supposed to be empowering
these days.

1462
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:52,848
Fuck you!

1463
01:36:52,982 --> 01:36:54,515
Well, now you're just
quoting the original.

1464
01:36:56,184 --> 01:36:58,586
But it wouldn't work
with just you, Sam.

1465
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:02,457
See, we had to bring the legacy
characters back to make it matter.

1466
01:37:03,358 --> 01:37:06,127
Can't have a bona fide Halloween
without Jamie Lee!

1467
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,261
Nope!

1468
01:37:07,395 --> 01:37:08,730
Dewey had to die
to make it real.

1469
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:11,199
To show that this
wasn't just some bullshit,

1470
01:37:11,332 --> 01:37:15,004
cash-in, run-of-the-mill sequel.

1471
01:37:15,136 --> 01:37:18,706
Because our movie
has fucking stakes!

1472
01:37:19,607 --> 01:37:22,176
'Cause anyone can die
in a requel.

1473
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:24,579
No!

1474
01:37:26,347 --> 01:37:28,316
Goddamn it. Whoa, whoa!

1475
01:37:28,449 --> 01:37:30,785
No, hey! Sit the fuck down.

1476
01:37:34,222 --> 01:37:36,257
I'm so sorry, Sid.

1477
01:37:36,391 --> 01:37:38,226
We can't let you live either.

1478
01:37:38,359 --> 01:37:40,328
I mean,
surviving this many times...

1479
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:42,664
that would just be ridiculous.

1480
01:37:42,797 --> 01:37:45,968
This time the fans are gonna be
the ones who win.

1481
01:37:48,636 --> 01:37:51,572
- That about cover it?
- Nailed it, baby.

1482
01:37:52,373 --> 01:37:53,708
Get Tara out of the closet.

1483
01:37:53,842 --> 01:37:56,477
We got to start staging
the bodies!

1484
01:37:56,611 --> 01:38:00,381
Stay with me, Sid.
Stay with me.

1485
01:38:00,515 --> 01:38:03,251
You really
should've listened to Dewey.

1486
01:38:03,384 --> 01:38:06,754
He nailed it in one!
Dude, look at the love interest!

1487
01:38:06,889 --> 01:38:07,956
Are you fucking stupid?

1488
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:10,159
I even had you convinced
it could be your sister.

1489
01:38:12,493 --> 01:38:14,830
Um, she's not here.

1490
01:38:17,498 --> 01:38:19,835
What the fuck do you mean,
"She's not here"?

1491
01:38:19,968 --> 01:38:21,136
She's not here!

1492
01:38:21,269 --> 01:38:23,371
I untied her.

1493
01:38:24,405 --> 01:38:26,875
Guess you're not
as persuasive as you thought.

1494
01:38:33,015 --> 01:38:34,950
That's for you.

1495
01:38:35,084 --> 01:38:36,551
Yeah.

1496
01:38:36,684 --> 01:38:38,653
Like your gimpy little sister's
gonna make a difference.

1497
01:38:38,786 --> 01:38:40,455
She's our fucking pincushion
at this point.

1498
01:38:40,588 --> 01:38:43,624
Amber! Fan out.
She couldn't have gotten far.

1499
01:38:43,758 --> 01:38:45,493
I can't find her!

1500
01:38:51,934 --> 01:38:53,468
Amber?

1501
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:19,862
Sam! Where you going?
Your big scene's coming up!

1502
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:29,303
Fucking kill you!

1503
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:34,308
The fucking hand sanitizer?

1504
01:39:39,982 --> 01:39:42,617
No, no, no, it's not my fault!
It's not my fault!

1505
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,552
Let me guess,
the movies made you do it?

1506
01:39:44,685 --> 01:39:47,256
No, it was the message boards!
I was radicalized.

1507
01:39:47,388 --> 01:39:49,524
- By movie fans?
- Yes, they're so mad!

1508
01:39:49,657 --> 01:39:51,292
Please, it's not my fault.
I'm just a dumb kid.

1509
01:39:51,425 --> 01:39:52,693
I wanted to be
a part of something.

1510
01:39:52,828 --> 01:39:56,098
"A part of something"?
You killed my best friend!

1511
01:39:56,231 --> 01:39:58,200
Yeah, and he died like a pussy.

1512
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:13,982
That's the thing about slashers,
Sam.

1513
01:40:16,018 --> 01:40:17,820
So many blood trails.

1514
01:40:17,953 --> 01:40:19,554
This one yours?

1515
01:40:20,521 --> 01:40:22,456
Only one way to find out!

1516
01:40:28,729 --> 01:40:31,465
I was the last thing Dewey saw
before he died too.

1517
01:40:31,599 --> 01:40:33,836
I can't believe
I get to do you both.

1518
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:38,639
No last-minute saves this time.
Your story's over!

1519
01:40:44,146 --> 01:40:45,981
Time to pass the torch.

1520
01:40:46,581 --> 01:40:48,349
It's all yours, bitch!

1521
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,789
- You want to do the honors?
- This one's yours.

1522
01:40:59,627 --> 01:41:02,331
No, stop, stop, stop!
I'm sorry about Dewey.

1523
01:41:02,496 --> 01:41:03,832
Fuck you.

1524
01:41:18,013 --> 01:41:19,647
Enjoy that torch.

1525
01:41:35,763 --> 01:41:38,100
Stop...

1526
01:41:38,233 --> 01:41:39,400
fucking up...

1527
01:41:39,533 --> 01:41:41,569
my ending!

1528
01:41:47,042 --> 01:41:48,076
Sam?

1529
01:41:50,478 --> 01:41:51,813
Sam!

1530
01:42:00,655 --> 01:42:02,057
Okay.

1531
01:42:08,931 --> 01:42:10,765
What are you gonna do now, huh?

1532
01:42:10,899 --> 01:42:13,101
Make a scary phone call to me?

1533
01:42:13,235 --> 01:42:16,737
Pop out of that closet
in a Ghostface mask?

1534
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:18,407
No.

1535
01:42:18,974 --> 01:42:20,976
Because you're the villain!

1536
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:24,645
And the villain dies at the end.

1537
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:26,714
Those are the rules.

1538
01:42:27,816 --> 01:42:29,550
I'm introducing
a new rule.

1539
01:42:30,819 --> 01:42:32,854
And what would that be? Huh?

1540
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:35,157
Well?

1541
01:42:37,893 --> 01:42:40,795
Never fuck with
the daughter of a serial killer.

1542
01:43:03,751 --> 01:43:05,519
Wait!

1543
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:11,525
What about... my ending?

1544
01:43:16,664 --> 01:43:18,033
Here it comes.

1545
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:19,734
No!

1546
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:57,538
Careful,
they always come back.

1547
01:44:08,316 --> 01:44:09,851
Okay, then.

1548
01:44:17,926 --> 01:44:22,264
I still prefer <i>The Babadook.</i>

1549
01:44:34,309 --> 01:44:35,444
Are you okay?

1550
01:44:35,576 --> 01:44:37,145
- Are you good?
- Mm-hmm.

1551
01:44:47,422 --> 01:44:48,890
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

1552
01:44:51,126 --> 01:44:52,660
Excuse me, sir.

1553
01:44:54,595 --> 01:44:56,764
- Hey.
- Hey.

1554
01:44:56,898 --> 01:44:58,732
She's gonna be okay.

1555
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:13,215
Can you take us to a
different hospital this time?

1556
01:45:13,348 --> 01:45:14,682
Of course.

1557
01:45:17,352 --> 01:45:18,854
You ready to go?

1558
01:45:23,757 --> 01:45:25,861
I'll be right back, yeah?

1559
01:45:32,267 --> 01:45:33,869
Your vitals look good.

1560
01:45:34,569 --> 01:45:36,471
Just sit tight
for a draft, okay?

1561
01:45:36,605 --> 01:45:38,874
Sidney. Gale.

1562
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:42,978
Thank you both.

1563
01:45:43,677 --> 01:45:44,980
For everything.

1564
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,183
Are you gonna be all right?

1565
01:45:49,017 --> 01:45:51,920
I'll survive.
I always do.

1566
01:45:52,487 --> 01:45:53,822
You were right...

1567
01:45:54,322 --> 01:45:55,957
about not running.

1568
01:45:56,525 --> 01:45:58,059
Sorry about that.

1569
01:45:59,861 --> 01:46:01,129
How are you doing?

1570
01:46:02,864 --> 01:46:04,399
Ask me in a few days.

1571
01:46:06,101 --> 01:46:08,403
But at least I know
what I'm gonna write about.

1572
01:46:08,537 --> 01:46:10,138
What's that?

1573
01:46:11,106 --> 01:46:12,207
Not this.

1574
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:14,543
Those fuckers can die
in anonymity.

1575
01:46:15,343 --> 01:46:17,212
But maybe something
about a good man

1576
01:46:17,345 --> 01:46:19,381
who used to be
the sheriff here once.

1577
01:46:20,748 --> 01:46:22,450
I'd like to read that story.

1578
01:46:23,852 --> 01:46:25,954
Can I ask you a weird question?

1579
01:46:26,488 --> 01:46:28,023
Yeah.

1580
01:46:29,291 --> 01:46:30,926
Am I gonna be okay?

1581
01:46:33,395 --> 01:46:34,896
Eventually.

1582
01:46:59,187 --> 01:47:01,389
- Hey.
- Wait. Sam, Sam, Sam!

1583
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:03,858
Thank you.

1584
01:47:06,228 --> 01:47:08,796
Well, you're not going
anywhere without me.

1585
01:47:09,864 --> 01:47:11,166
Don't worry.

1586
01:47:11,299 --> 01:47:13,802
I'm gonna hold your hand
all the way there.

1587
01:47:17,172 --> 01:47:19,274
I can take care of her
and her sister.

1588
01:47:19,407 --> 01:47:21,509
She's all ready
for transportation.

1589
01:47:30,619 --> 01:47:35,357
Twenty-five years ago,
almost to the day, in this very house

1590
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:37,058
a tragic story ended.

1591
01:47:37,192 --> 01:47:40,095
Tonight, a new chapter
came to a close.

1592
01:47:40,228 --> 01:47:42,364
Police do not have
a lot of information right now,

1593
01:47:42,497 --> 01:47:44,366
as they are still
collecting evidence.

1594
01:47:44,499 --> 01:47:47,402
As you can see, this is
a very active crime scene here.

1595
01:47:47,535 --> 01:47:50,238
An unknown number of fatalities,
several injuries,

1596
01:47:50,372 --> 01:47:53,842
some people being taken off by
ambulance right now as we speak.

1597
01:47:53,975 --> 01:47:55,776
This is a developing story...

01:48:17,372 --> 01:48:22,372
