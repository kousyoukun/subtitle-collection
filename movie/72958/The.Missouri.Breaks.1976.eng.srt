1
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,277
The first time I saw this country,

2
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:54,327
it had buffalo grass
and bluejoint up to the stirrups.

3
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,456
By the second year we had
8,000 Texas half-bred cattle

4
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:03,748
and over 3,500 volumes of
English literature in my library.

5
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:07,753
We just cut out
the unbranded stock

6
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,925
and divided 'em up between the outfits.

7
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:15,270
There was no arguin'
over mavericks like today.

8
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,721
You got it good today.

9
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:22,151
Two per cent annual loss then.
Now it's seven from rustling alone,

10
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:28,150
not to mention winterkill, calving loss,
miring down in the spring.

11
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,371
How many are you?

12
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:44,960
Mr Braxton, did you see they sew old boot
tops on the saddle to hold ammunition?

13
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:48,212
Pete, don't pester him
if he doesn't wanna be pestered.

14
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:52,213
Well, it'd just be awful nice
to know the whole story.

15
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:56,885
Well... it's beautiful country.

16
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:01,437
Yes, sir. It sure is.

17
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:06,065
You especially feel that now?

18
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:12,692
Yeah.

19
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:25,711
(singing "Oh, Susannah")

20
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:53,948
Sh, sh, sh.

21
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:08,080
(child cries)

22
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:13,678
I sure hope them sportin' ladies
don't get sunburned.

23
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,511
I like 'em white as pastry.

24
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:21,184
Ladies.

25
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:36,281
Are we all set here?

26
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,867
All set, Pete.

27
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:55,422
Shall we start the horse... or will you?

28
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,805
I will, sir.

29
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,930
Well, that's one of them.

30
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:43,510
His name was Sandy Chase and he came
here from Rhode Island with the army.

31
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,888
He was 24 years old.

32
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:54,779
We lost seven per cent of stock between
spring and fall last year, to rustlers.

33
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:58,857
You always mention the percentage.
I wonder why you do that.

34
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:02,198
This is my fourth frontier
and I know how they run.

35
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,166
I was in the California gold fields
before I was 18.

36
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:09,160
I was at the rush at Alder Gulch
and I went to South America.

37
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:13,246
These long ropers in the Missouri Breaks
are a mixed bag.

38
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:16,005
Barbers from Minneapolis,

39
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:21,511
failed grangers, Scandinavian half-breeds,
wolfers and woodcutters,

40
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:25,640
dishonest apprentices,
raftsmen, poisoners.

41
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:30,145
You give them a chance
and they'll waste everything.

42
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:41,529
You're astonished at my arrogance,
at not even having a trial, aren't you?

43
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:44,327
Then why don't you get over it?

44
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:49,083
Our situation has become
nearly as bad as it could be.

45
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:53,589
Honey, pull down Tristram Shandy again
for me, would you?

46
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:11,146
Daddy.

47
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,986
Excuse me.

48
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:32,958
Come on! Giddap! Yah!

49
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,161
Got the gate.

50
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:25,009
How'd she go, Tom?

51
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,592
Everybody else been back a day.

52
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:33,306
Brought in about 14 head
of the first-class order.

53
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,563
Yeah.

54
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,690
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,857
How was Wyoming?

56
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:45,198
It was fine.

57
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:51,282
Spent a couple of days in KC trying to
keep from associating with criminals.

58
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:55,497
Why, they've hit the Union Pacific
down there so many times

59
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,294
the place has begun to look like
a lawmen's convention.

60
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:01,713
They got two Pinkerton in KC

61
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:06,671
and I do believe one of 'em
was the legendary Charlie Siringo.

62
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,301
Did he claim to be a border cowboy?

63
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:14,687
Can't remember.
Said he could talk Mexican.

64
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,855
Yeah, that's him.

65
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:20,684
How'd you know it was a detective?

66
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:25,530
Rancher's wife wanting to go to bed
with him. He kept givin' her a "no".

67
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,197
Damned if I can understand that.

68
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:31,365
- Well, I took care of her, Cal.
- You did that, huh?

69
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,998
You're damn sure.
Had a good time too, thank you.

70
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,621
Did you?

71
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:41,795
Spent the night in Martinsdale.
Couldn't get no credit at the whorehouse,

72
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:46,172
so I picked up this chubby little girl
off some sodbuster's outfit.

73
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:48,760
Yeah... How was she?

74
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,690
About like a Swiss clock. Same exact
movement over and over again.

75
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,148
Yeah.

76
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:21,942
- It was Sandy, huh?
- Yeah.

77
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,278
Yeah.

78
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,082
Sandy's gone. He's dead.

79
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:33,916
David Braxton's foreman...
What's his name, Cary?

80
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:36,251
- Pete Marker.
- Pete Marker.

81
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:39,050
...caught him and they hung him.

82
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:42,584
Goddamn it.

83
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,054
I knew somebody's bunch
wasn't in that corral.

84
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,180
Little Tod was in town.
Everybody was at the hanging.

85
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,644
- How'd Sandy go out?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

86
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,987
They hung him up on a cottonwood,
though, and he sort of...

87
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,571
He sort of what?

88
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,579
Sort of strangled for a while.

89
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:18,630
Braxton was there dressed in a suit.

90
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:21,591
- Lookin' like God.
- Hah!

91
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,513
Goddamn.

92
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,760
I'll tell you, the first time I met Sandy...

93
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:33,100
Listen at this, now.

94
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:36,598
The first time I met Sandy,
he was rustling on his own.

95
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:40,777
He had a stolen cavalry pony
and he kept this dog.

96
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:45,901
As soon as he killed a steer, he'd cut
the brand off and feed it to the dog.

97
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,489
He said to get enough
evidence to convict him

98
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:51,537
they'd have to pick through
the dog's shit for a week

99
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:54,535
before they could find the brand.

100
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:08,259
My aunt ran a laundry in St Paul.

101
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:13,099
Got strangled by a Chinaman
while she's washing her dog.

102
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:16,181
It's easy to die. Easy!

103
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,809
Well, they sure killed Sandy.

104
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:25,155
He was the only comedian in this outfit.
Every outfit oughta have a comedian.

105
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:28,401
You can't run that many rustled horses
across open ground.

106
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,452
I know I've been saying that.
But you can't.

107
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:37,202
What do we do, Tom? Open up a stand
and sell stolen horses over the counter?

108
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,953
No. We gotta get a relay ranch
halfway across

109
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,544
so as we got somewheres
to relay 'em at.

110
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:48,052
- That's right.
- That's just really great.

111
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:50,218
Only we ain't got a ranch.

112
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:54,013
We ain't got no money!
The only horses we got are out there.

113
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:57,559
We can't move them across the breaks
without everybody knowing.

114
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:00,523
Let's just stick up the NP Railroad
and buy a ranch.

115
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,523
Hell, let's rob a bank.

116
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:06,601
If we're gonna get hung for rustlin' horses,
we oughta be robbin' trains.

117
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,693
Why don't you boys join
that Hole-in-the-Wall bunch

118
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:13,241
and you'll be around people
that think like that?

119
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:24,589
Boy, a couple of years ago they'd have
put Sandy in Red Lodge penitentiary,

120
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:26,755
weavin' bridles.

121
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:33,175
Seems like there's
something new in the air.

122
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,896
I bet you Marker'll bait crows with Sandy
for a week before he'll cut him down.

123
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:45,939
I worked for that son of a bitch once
on the reservation roundup.

124
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,822
He will leave Sandy in the trees.

125
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:55,443
When we was fightin' in Kansas,
we had relays all over the damn place.

126
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,331
We relayed a cousin of mine

127
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:01,957
all the way from Medicine Tree
to the hot springs in New Mexico.

128
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:03,995
He beat the telegraph.

129
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,626
Took the detectives two years to cover
the same ground he'd covered in a week.

130
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,971
And when they got there
he was in his grave up on the Chama.

131
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:17,842
Why was you havin' to move
this cousin around so much?

132
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:20,646
He did card tricks.

133
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,811
I get it.

134
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:29,811
He done a trick for this nigger on
the Chama. The nigger throttled him.

135
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:32,403
Mm-hm. I see.

136
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:38,152
Say, Cal...

137
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:41,872
Why don't we put that relay
in Braxton's backyard?

138
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:47,002
Yeah.

139
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:52,507
It beats sendin' three or four horses
at a time out into Kansas.

140
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:55,922
The law there is pretty effective now.

141
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:04,226
I get a kick out of Little Tod.
He says we oughta rob a train.

142
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:11,693
No...

143
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:15,023
I'm tired, Cal.

144
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:20,617
I'm gonna turn in.
Tomorrow we have a nice day.

145
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,710
Too bad about Sandy.

146
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,242
(train whistle)

147
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:49,165
(cocks gun)

148
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:54,706
All right, move over there. Move, move!

149
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,759
I want you to uncouple that car. Hurry up!

150
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:01,421
I can't do it. I'm not sure I'm able to do it.

151
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:03,680
Just get down there and pull the pin out.

152
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,305
- I'm a clerk. I'm not mechanical.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

153
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:23,410
Whoo-hoo!

154
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:40,549
- Get the money out. What's your name?
- Nelson.

155
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,589
Nelson, you do this right,

156
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:47,634
you can say you've seen Jesse James
and lived to tell the story.

157
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,439
You're not Jesse James.

158
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,980
You ain't Charlie Siringo.
Just give me the money, Nelson.

159
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:58,487
- I'm not permitted to touch this.
- Gimme the goddamn money.

160
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:04,858
Whoa!

161
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:18,205
Gee!

162
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:22,256
- Don't start blamin' me.
- I am blamin' you.

163
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:25,175
This is it on trains. This is it.

164
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,588
God Almighty.

165
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:29,762
This is it. No more trains, Tod.

166
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:33,098
- I just don't wanna get blamed.
- Sh...

167
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:35,521
We got it! It's all over the place.

168
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,359
Yahoo!

169
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:40,811
(Little Tod laughs) We got it.

170
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:47,319
- You need some help?
- Just pick up the money, goddamn it.

171
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,281
Agh!

172
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:55,871
But they're all ones.
Tom, they're all ones.

173
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:02,425
- Where am I gonna put 'em all?
- I don't wanna hear that now. Just...

174
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,847
Ain't it just terrible?

175
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:11,517
The next time you mention trains,
it's gonna get worse.

176
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:16,515
You boys new at this?

177
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:23,113
Appreciate your concern, Nelson.

178
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:26,316
(laughing)

179
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:27,863
Yahoo!

180
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,321
Let's get every goddamn one up.

181
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:34,411
Hey, look! There's tens in the water.

182
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:37,378
Get in there, Tod.
Get in the water. Get those tens.

183
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,912
Yahoo!

184
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:44,927
(train whistle)

185
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,720
Little Tod...

186
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:54,387
Get out of my way.

187
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,567
Come on. Let's get outta here
with what we got.

188
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:24,549
Mornin', my little darlin'.

189
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:28,259
Hey, Si. We'll see 'em in church.

190
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:36,140
I think all of you working men and women

191
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:39,475
have had time now to consider
this case before us.

192
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:42,728
- There's Braxton.
- I have reviewed its details,

193
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:46,527
and now I feel secure enough
to pronounce sentence.

194
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:50,026
Subject, of course,
to your scrutiny and support.

195
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,616
Make him confess first.

196
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:56,032
I think the kindest thing
we can do to this bird

197
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,918
is to send him up to the territorial prison.

198
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:03,790
He's been about as cooperative
as any prisoner we've tried around here.

199
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:08,301
- I see no direct call to hang him.
- Don't he look like God?

200
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:11,845
Who's got an opinion about
how long we might send him up?

201
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:15,058
-  Life is indicated.
- (woman) He'll take anything.

202
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:17,392
How would 10 to 20 sound to you?

203
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:21,649
Sounds about right to me.
How soon would I be eligible for parole?

204
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:24,646
- In about two weeks.
- (laughter)

205
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:31,152
Anything you'd like to say
before we send you to your just deserts?

206
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:33,776
And if I may speak for the court,

207
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:36,748
we would prefer
that it be something colourful,

208
00:22:36,874 --> 00:22:40,040
life on the frontier being what it is.

209
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:42,917
Just that...

210
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:50,838
it may seem to you boys
like a hard way to make the papers,

211
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:54,506
but I'm not ashamed of robbing that train,

212
00:22:54,641 --> 00:23:01,011
of blowing bridges, sticking up banks, or
for my careless devil-may-care gunplay.

213
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:02,808
(laughter)

214
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:06,939
I'm not ashamed of pissing away
the money on hard living either,

215
00:23:07,071 --> 00:23:10,190
because I'm that kind of guy.

216
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:13,609
But as a concession to me
for my cooperation,

217
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:17,444
I would like you all
to refer to me from now on

218
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:20,154
as "The Lonesome Kid".

219
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,459
Especially in front of outsiders
here in the West.

220
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:31,544
That's enough of that! Let's all go up
to the bar and make fools of ourselves.

221
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:33,718
(music starts)

222
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:49,275
Yahoo!

223
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:55,068
(Braxton) Whoo! I haven't danced like that
since Chicago.

224
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,910
I'm Tom Logan.

225
00:23:57,037 --> 00:24:03,538
I'd like to congratulate you, sir,
on your treatment of that impostor.

226
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:06,338
Oh... My daughter, Jane.

227
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:07,839
Hello.

228
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:10,966
People have told me
I should talk to you, Mr Braxton.

229
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:14,378
I just sold a family implement business
in the Shonkin range

230
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:18,012
and I'm thinkin' of buying a small ranch.

231
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:24,680
You done so well I'd like
a piece out by you for good luck.

232
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:30,527
Well... the Cannon Ranch is for sale.

233
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,025
Isn't much. Four sections and a cabin.
Pole corrals around it.

234
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,860
But it's well watered,
and pretty fair shelter.

235
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:44,912
The owner's living in town now.
Has a cooperage at the end of Main,

236
00:24:45,043 --> 00:24:47,083
past the livery.

237
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:51,375
I understand you had
some rustlin' problems.

238
00:24:51,508 --> 00:24:54,343
Seven per cent losses per annum.

239
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:01,268
You should know about that.
First year, that might just break you.

240
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:03,302
Mm...

241
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:07,481
I understand
you had to hang someone here.

242
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:10,732
I did that.

243
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,860
Oh, that's tough.

244
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:18,566
What was this?
Some kind of a desperado?

245
00:25:18,702 --> 00:25:20,077
No.

246
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:24,996
He was a thief, with probably a million
good reasons for being on hard times.

247
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:28,708
The main thing is that
we put him out of his misery.

248
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:35,498
Don't you believe
in hangin' thieves, miss?

249
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:37,675
No, sir, I don't. Do you?

250
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:42,716
I surely do. How in the world else
are we gonna have law and order?

251
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:47,099
Well, what do you know?

252
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:51,477
Maybe you can buy that Cannon Ranch,
get started in the cattle business.

253
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,686
With your attitude toward human life,

254
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,236
you may yet get to be
one of the barons of this prairie,

255
00:25:57,366 --> 00:26:01,992
and have your picture on page one,
or page three, of the Chicago papers.

256
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,115
And for your birthday you can have
a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice,

257
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:10,833
just the way the other hangmen
up this way do.

258
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:14,755
You sound bitter, lady.

259
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:17,754
You should have seen
that young man's face.

260
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:20,638
- He did not die quickly.
- I don't wanna hear about it.

261
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:23,800
I don't think you can really picture
the man's face.

262
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:27,101
I don't want to hear about it, miss.

263
00:26:28,438 --> 00:26:31,108
Thank you for your information,
Mr Braxton.

264
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:36,572
I'll go over to the cooperage and ask
Mr Cannon about them four sections.

265
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:39,366
Pleasure to meet you too, miss.

266
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:58,416
Welcome to town, now.

267
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:01,885
Damn, I feel better now.

268
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:04,053
- Damned if I don't.
- Me too.

269
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:06,222
(thunder)

270
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:15,813
Oh, God! You didn't cut him down yet.

271
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:17,984
We did! That's...

272
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:21,525
Whoa!

273
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,326
- Oh...
- Oh, Pete.

274
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:29,242
My God. They've killed my man.

275
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:39,089
- Si, are we gonna go to that whorehouse?
- Where the hell you clodhoppers been at?

276
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:42,586
File that. We got it.
Let's go for a ride.

277
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:45,638
I wanna go to a whorehouse,
play cards, get drunk.

278
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:50,511
We can go to the whorehouse later.
Ain't you got no pride of ownership?

279
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:54,097
I buy you a brand-new ranch.
Do you wanna ride out and look at it?

280
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:57,317
Hell, we own it, we can go anytime.
Let's go for a drink.

281
00:27:57,444 --> 00:28:00,694
- Let's play cards...
- Let's go to the whorehouse.

282
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:05,283
You're gonna have to pick and choose
on that cos the money's about all gone.

283
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,411
- The money can't be gone.
- Well, it is and I'm glad.

284
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:10,246
- I'm glad too.
- Why?

285
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:12,200
Because robbin' trains is...

286
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:16,877
We start a pattern of robbin' trains
and we're gonna get detectives.

287
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:20,339
From then, you can back
the calendar down till they hang us.

288
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,506
That's why.

289
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:32,140
I still think we should rob a bank.
Rob trains, rob a bank.

290
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,722
- All right, let's go to the whorehouse.
- Mm-mm.

291
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:47,358
You here for a party?

292
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:52,907
- That's right.
- What kind of a party?

293
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,084
(sniggering)

294
00:29:00,215 --> 00:29:02,255
Well...

295
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,881
You got any girls?

296
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:19,272
Go on, Si.

297
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:32,537
The girls here can show you
to the party rooms.

298
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:35,788
I like them ribbons.

299
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:39,289
Anybody want anything to eat?

300
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:46,213
Well, is he the one that I want.
You just come right on up here with me.

301
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:52,509
Where are the chubby ones?
I want a chub...

302
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:54,682
Oh, yeah.

303
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:59,021
Ain't that a match-up?
Ain't that a match-up?

304
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:01,770
Just like you and your horse, Little Tod.

305
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,204
- That one got away!
- You'll pay for that.

306
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:22,171
In my home town,
I'm considered a dangerous person.

307
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:28,133
Yeah? In your home town a man can get
a bad reputation for smokin' corn silk.

308
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,133
Cary'll stay at the breaks,
but somebody must tend this place.

309
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:37,134
I can tell you one damn thing,
it isn't gonna be me.

310
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,895
Agh!

311
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:46,817
I got you! Told you I was gonna get you,
you son of a bitch.

312
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:48,986
Here! How about this?

313
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,583
I like this place, Cal.

314
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,796
- Yeah.
- I like it quiet.

315
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:10,340
(clattering)

316
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,799
Cary, don't throw them tools
down there like that, please.

317
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:20,309
I spent my first 18 years
on one of these goddamn things,

318
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:22,764
workin' for my uncle that raised me.

319
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:25,437
I worked myself cross-eyed too.

320
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:31,523
About the only thing I had for distraction
was this dog.

321
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:35,991
I'd had the dog since it was ten years old.

322
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:39,999
And he shot it...

323
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:44,667
for stickin' its tongue on a pat of butter.

324
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:48,080
So I stayed one more night.

325
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:53,968
And I killed his seed bull,
I rustled every damn horse he had

326
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:58,142
including a racer that I sold as
a cow pony to an Indian rancher,

327
00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:00,593
and I took the whole damn remuda.

328
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:04,062
I come within a hair's breadth
of sendin' him to kingdom come.

329
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:09,232
I was that close to shootin'
that son of a bitch in the brainpan.

330
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:16,567
I never did have that kind of background.

331
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:20,866
Never had nothin' neither.
My folks always wanted a place.

332
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:24,249
They was good people,
so I always saw it with their eyes.

333
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:26,619
I can see that.

334
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:32,758
But when you think about it, you wouldn't
want the weight of a damn place like this.

335
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:38,843
Do you do alterations too, ma'am?

336
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:44,018
Nope.

337
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:50,399
And I don't do
your wire-ripped shirts neither.

338
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:56,904
There you go.

339
00:32:57,035 --> 00:33:01,080
Si, you're beginnin' to sound
like a real old lady.

340
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:04,076
What do you say
we just jump this pissant seamstress?

341
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:08,289
You guys are soon gonna learn
to treat me nice.

342
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:11,292
- Yahoo!
- Whoa! Watch it!

343
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,084
Come on! I'll kill ya.

344
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:16,587
Everybody's so scared of the Mounties
that nobody even tries.

345
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:18,548
The horses are hardly guarded.

346
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:24,268
- You talkin' to me about Canada again?
- You're goddamn right I am.

347
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:26,472
Them Mounties scares me, Cal.

348
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:30,105
Hell, they scare everybody.
That's why it'll be so easy.

349
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:32,441
The Indians won't touch them horses.

350
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,441
We can take all 60 of them ponies
at a walk.

351
00:33:39,077 --> 00:33:41,485
All Canadian government brand?

352
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:47,576
Until we can get 'em to the breaks for
modification, and then down here to relay.

353
00:33:47,711 --> 00:33:50,795
That doesn't quite
settle it though, does it?

354
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:53,378
No, it don't.

355
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,629
Someone's gonna have to stay here.

356
00:33:57,762 --> 00:34:00,633
Well, it isn't gonna be me.

357
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:05,058
It's gotta be one of the two of us,
and I'll tell you one thing.

358
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:08,970
You had all the fun on that train
while I baby-sat these savages.

359
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:13,520
I'm going to Canada for sure.
That's settled. That's it.

360
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,165
(sighs)

361
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,712
I gotta stay on this
goddamn piece of ground.

362
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:37,925
Goddamn! I can't even believe this!

363
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:45,302
That is pitiful.
You assholes will just get lost.

364
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:51,022
- He was the best foreman.
- He was the only foreman I ever had.

365
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:55,099
- Pete Marker was a hard man.
- He surely was, David.

366
00:34:55,236 --> 00:35:00,278
He could break a horse better than
the bronc fighters. He could do every job.

367
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:02,982
He was a great ramrod.

368
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,911
He personified the American West
in the days of its rowdy youth.

369
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,496
- Sure did.
- Excuse me.

370
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:05,223
- Lee Clayton.
- Oh, my God, you gave me a scare.

371
00:36:05,348 --> 00:36:09,891
- All I could see was your horse.
- That was all you were meant to see.

372
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:14,062
Is the owner about?

373
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,895
Who may I say is calling?

374
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:20,395
Lee Clayton. I just said that.

375
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,359
I have a short memory.

376
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:30,199
Well, I'll tell Daddy that you're here,

377
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:33,036
and then I can get back
to what I was doing before.

378
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:39,040
Tell him Lee Clayton from Medicine Hat,
Wyoming. Here on business.

379
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:41,415
- You got it?
- Yes.

380
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:05,153
- Come in. I've been expecting you.
- Oh, sir.

381
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:08,901
I don't know why it would not
have tired me more than it did,

382
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:14,577
to have travelled all this distance
without more than a catnap.

383
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:18,292
You've a wonderful set of books here, sir.

384
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:20,627
- Yes, I have.
- Truly, truly beautiful.

385
00:37:20,757 --> 00:37:22,963
I don't spend the time with them I should.

386
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:30,340
I'm of the opinion... I would only claim
books that was about right from wrong.

387
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:35,137
Otherwise how are we to find
our paradise among the stars?

388
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:37,311
True. Please.

389
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:43,484
Oh, sir. I'm sorry for your trouble.
I wasn't aware.

390
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:47,196
Gentlemen, Robert E Lee Clayton.

391
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:54,404
I understand that you hung a thief

392
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,783
and neglected to find out where they were
caching the stock. How was that?

393
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,163
He didn't wanna talk. He was about to die.

394
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:06,213
Oh, I see. Then you pampered him.

395
00:38:06,344 --> 00:38:09,380
- No, sir!
- We hung that man.

396
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:12,965
Well, you pampered the man...
you pampered the man,

397
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:18,059
and the result of that
is the loss of this poor man's life!

398
00:38:19,274 --> 00:38:21,847
- Please, this is outrageous.
- You, you, you...

399
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:25,519
- (woman screams)
- Take your hands off!

400
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:32,156
Realise the fact that as a result of that
this poor man has lost his life.

401
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:38,206
If you'd invited me into the neighbourhood
before, it wouldn't have happened.

402
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:41,335
You've got to give me some thoughts.

403
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:46,466
I'm gonna turn my horse out.
Then I'll wash my body.

404
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:53,301
And, miss...
the only thing not on my diet

405
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:57,810
would be the green top of the beet
and okra.

406
00:38:58,354 --> 00:39:04,024
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me,
but I'm under a severe attack from a tooth.

407
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:06,987
Sir. Miss.

408
00:39:13,578 --> 00:39:16,448
- Where'd he come from?
- What was all that about?

409
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:20,993
I got recommendations for this man from
all the Wyoming outfits he's worked for.

410
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:24,413
- I'm assured that he's a top regulator.
- Regulator?

411
00:39:24,547 --> 00:39:28,794
- You mean you asked him up here?
- You're damn right I did.

412
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:32,177
They killed my ramrod
and I want them to pay for it.

413
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:34,796
I always wondered
what Lee Clayton looked like.

414
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:37,803
And smelled like.

415
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:40,224
I always figured him to be a little fella.

416
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:43,973
He's supposed to have a Creedmore rifle
he carries as a saddle gun.

417
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:46,350
Supposed to be able
to hit out to 500 yards.

418
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:49,273
- Oh, Mr Rate. 500 yards...
- I mean it.

419
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:52,572
He never carries a side arm,
so you know he's a dry-gulcher.

420
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,401
But he smells like a wet-gulcher
and he dresses like a clown.

421
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:59,989
He don't have no wife,
but he sure keeps himself spruced up.

422
00:40:00,124 --> 00:40:05,664
Many a rustler has said his prayers when
he got a whiff of them lavender bath salts.

423
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:09,082
(chattering and laughter continues)

424
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:16,344
- Daddy, I wanna know how...
- Not now. Shh!

425
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:19,677
- Vern, scat. Out of here.
- You betcha. I will.

426
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:24,474
- Adios, buddies.
- Send you a postal card from Canada.

427
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:27,063
Cal, why can't I go to Canada?

428
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:29,862
You gotta tend to the cabin
in the breaks, Cary.

429
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:35,029
You don't hear Tom complainin'.
See you in a few weeks, Tom.

430
00:40:37,578 --> 00:40:39,618
(horse neighs)

431
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:44,911
They'll be back, Buck.
Don't you worry about it.

432
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:58,679
Well, by gosh. Good mornin' to you, miss.

433
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:02,971
Good morning to you, Mr Logan.
You bought this place already, huh?

434
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:04,646
Yes, ma'am.

435
00:41:04,772 --> 00:41:09,233
I guess that kinda
makes us neighbours, doesn't it?

436
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,483
- Where are you headed?
- Oh, I'm gonna go over on the table.

437
00:41:14,615 --> 00:41:16,987
Well, may I accompany you?

438
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:19,157
No.

439
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:23,415
- Why not?
- No good reason. I don't want company.

440
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:26,577
Come on. Give me a chance.

441
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:30,459
Give you a chance.
Give you a chance for what?

442
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:36,011
Miss, I'm gonna take this opportunity
to be just a little damn bit offended.

443
00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:38,675
Cos if there's anybody in this district

444
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:43,302
who's got a right to think of themselves
as wholesome companionship,

445
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:46,105
why, it's yours truly.

446
00:41:50,693 --> 00:41:55,853
If you're such a wholesome companion,
what were you doing at the whorehouse?

447
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,030
Who in the world told you that?

448
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:01,326
Mary O'Connell,
that little blonde you paid for.

449
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:03,660
Well, I hope that's all she told you.

450
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:06,956
She told me everything.
We're starved for news out here.

451
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:11,331
- All I ever hear about is grass.
- What's the matter with grass?

452
00:42:11,464 --> 00:42:14,999
Samuel Johnson said
"A blade of grass is a blade of grass."

453
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:19,796
- "Tell me about a human being."
- I don't understand that.

454
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:24,178
It just means that Samuel Johnson
was as bored as I am with nature.

455
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,145
We had a famous painter
out here last year.

456
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:31,684
That man must have painted ten square
miles of canvas, not one human face.

457
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:36,978
I wish he'd painted that boy Sandy hangin'
up so decoratively against the mountains.

458
00:42:37,114 --> 00:42:39,487
Because his pink tongue and white face

459
00:42:39,617 --> 00:42:42,322
would have set off
the green of Montana splendidly.

460
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:47,448
I mean, it would have made the
damnedest bank calendar you ever saw.

461
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:52,540
Well, you succeeded. This is where
I was coming to and you're still with me.

462
00:42:52,672 --> 00:42:55,127
The persistence
of the young rancher, huh?

463
00:42:55,258 --> 00:43:00,252
- Well, I know what I want is all.
- What do you want?

464
00:43:00,388 --> 00:43:03,472
I mean, I know what it is
when I want something.

465
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,051
- Oh, come on!
- "Oh, come on" what?

466
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:11,931
- Why don't you just say what you mean?
- This is what I mean.

467
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:16,146
- Do you want me?
- What does that mean?

468
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:19,482
I mean you're followin' me around.
What you got in mind?

469
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:22,735
- Me?
- Sexual intercourse?

470
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,576
- Oh, my...
- Well, all right.

471
00:43:27,248 --> 00:43:28,956
All right.

472
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:32,286
Come on. Get down off your horse.

473
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,212
I'm not gonna have any hesitation from
you. Not from a frequenter of whores.

474
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:40,046
All right, all right. Just back off.

475
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:43,131
I'm gonna step down at my own speed.

476
00:43:45,474 --> 00:43:47,514
All right.

477
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,680
I'm going to lose it right here,
in all these blades of grass.

478
00:43:55,735 --> 00:43:58,190
Do I have to come to you? All right.

479
00:43:58,321 --> 00:44:00,443
- Hold it.
- What?

480
00:44:00,573 --> 00:44:03,443
Who asked you to do all this?

481
00:44:03,576 --> 00:44:06,577
- Well, your entire behaviour...
- Never mind that.

482
00:44:06,704 --> 00:44:09,824
I didn't ask you.
You said that you wanted it.

483
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:12,495
- Well, do you?
- No.

484
00:44:12,627 --> 00:44:16,576
- Well, you're not gonna get it.
- Keep the dang thing. I don't want it.

485
00:44:16,714 --> 00:44:21,423
- I forgot. You do have your whores.
- Sure do. Like 'em too.

486
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:24,043
I'll tell you something. If you want them...

487
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,806
I keep tellin' ya. I want them a lot.
I don't want you at all.

488
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:31,093
Why are you bein' so mean to me?

489
00:44:31,228 --> 00:44:35,143
People have neglected to tell you
what a nasty little bitch you are,

490
00:44:35,274 --> 00:44:37,848
and I'm makin' up for their negligence.

491
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:41,188
I just seem mean.
I'm only being thorough.

492
00:44:46,911 --> 00:44:53,329
If you're gonna start that, I'm gonna go
home and shovel manure on the pansies.

493
00:44:55,044 --> 00:44:58,828
Well, you just wait a minute
because I'm gonna stop.

494
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,883
You gonna talk nice?

495
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:07,219
I will do my best.

496
00:45:07,932 --> 00:45:09,971
You bastard.

497
00:45:11,102 --> 00:45:15,099
- Can I have a kiss?
- No. I hardly know you.

498
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:21,103
Why don't we take a walk and talk about
the Wild West and how to get out of it?

499
00:45:22,905 --> 00:45:26,819
Well... all right. I can talk about that.

500
00:45:28,077 --> 00:45:30,912
Cal, I forgot how to tie a diamond hitch.

501
00:45:31,038 --> 00:45:34,158
- A squaw hitch is all you need.
- You'll be gone two weeks?

502
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:38,788
Give or take a few days. Cary, you're
gonna move some stock to make way.

503
00:45:38,921 --> 00:45:40,997
- No more than two...
- Or three at a time.

504
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:45,343
- I've been doin' this for a while.
- I reckon you have. Let's go.

505
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:50,590
Keep low, boy.

506
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:57,309
Hell of a damn way to ride off.

507
00:45:59,483 --> 00:46:01,523
(yelling)

508
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,487
- Stay with your horse.
- Get a hold.

509
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:09,660
Si, stay with your horse! Si!

510
00:46:09,785 --> 00:46:13,368
Goddamn it, he knows what he's doing.

511
00:46:15,332 --> 00:46:17,788
Si let go of the rope.

512
00:46:17,918 --> 00:46:19,958
Oh, Jesus.

513
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:22,459
- Help!
- You're gonna drown!

514
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,831
Help! Get me in.

515
00:46:28,971 --> 00:46:33,763
We did it. We crossed
that son of a bitch, didn't we?

516
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:37,807
I couldn't swim,
but I was swimmin', right?

517
00:46:39,857 --> 00:46:41,600
I can! I did it!

518
00:46:41,734 --> 00:46:44,307
We deserve a lot of damn credit.

519
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:48,110
We crossed the Mighty Mo
and I want some damn credit.

520
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,033
Supposin' if the catfish
in that son of a bitch could eat a pig.

521
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:55,617
Or a chicken.

522
00:46:57,917 --> 00:46:59,956
Get out.

523
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,709
- Easy, now.
- Tom!

524
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:08,465
Hey, Tom!

525
00:47:10,137 --> 00:47:11,679
Huh?

526
00:47:11,806 --> 00:47:15,221
You're the only rancher
who hasn't met the new regulator.

527
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:17,972
Tom Logan, Robert E Lee Clayton.

528
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:22,516
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance, sir.

529
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,401
Damn near... sucked my boot off.

530
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:29,277
Pleasure to meet you.

531
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:32,822
Regulator - ain't that like a dry-gulcher?

532
00:47:33,536 --> 00:47:36,655
That's not the softest term
you could use, I'd say.

533
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:40,537
Well, a regulator...
Correct me if I'm wrong.

534
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:43,540
Isn't a regulator one of these boys

535
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:46,790
that shoots people
and don't never get near 'em?

536
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:48,667
That's it.

537
00:47:51,428 --> 00:47:55,806
Well, what about the binoculars?
What are they for?

538
00:47:56,684 --> 00:48:00,812
Well, I've taken to watchin'
funny-lookin' birds.

539
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:03,897
I see.

540
00:48:04,024 --> 00:48:06,100
Well, hell, I don't know.

541
00:48:06,235 --> 00:48:10,731
I suppose if you didn't get a way off,
a mile or so to do the job,

542
00:48:10,865 --> 00:48:12,941
you'd just get messy like I done here.

543
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:15,946
Easy, Tom. Don't let me down.

544
00:48:16,078 --> 00:48:20,407
I've just heard this from all the other
dreamers tryin' to ranch around here.

545
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:27,255
Lee, did you ever hit a man from a mile off
while he was carryin' a pail of water?

546
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:30,050
A mile, well...

547
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:32,713
But I don't remember the pail.

548
00:48:33,721 --> 00:48:35,464
No, sir.

549
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:40,893
When you hang a man,
usually he has a chance to talk,

550
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,270
or say goodbye, write a letter...

551
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:48,144
Besides, a Creedmore...

552
00:48:49,653 --> 00:48:53,983
- It's a Creedmore, isn't it?
- It is a Creedmore, and a beautiful one.

553
00:48:54,116 --> 00:48:57,034
Must make a pretty good
mess of a human.

554
00:48:57,161 --> 00:49:00,743
You hit a guy from 500 yards out, say,

555
00:49:00,873 --> 00:49:06,080
why, the suddenness of it, he don't have a
few seconds to make his act of contrition.

556
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:08,833
And you never have to look him in the eye.

557
00:49:08,964 --> 00:49:11,586
Right there, that makes all the difference.

558
00:49:11,717 --> 00:49:15,797
I would disagree, sir. The thing that
makes all the difference in the world

559
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,259
is the fact that it accomplishes
the task, you see.

560
00:49:21,435 --> 00:49:23,677
This old boy in Wyoming...

561
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:25,604
Whoa.

562
00:49:26,482 --> 00:49:31,393
This old boy in Wyoming, he sat down
just to pull sandburs out of his trousers,

563
00:49:31,528 --> 00:49:35,941
and his skull suddenly flew into pieces
about the size of your thumbnail.

564
00:49:36,075 --> 00:49:40,820
That was the first time
I ever heard the term "regulator".

565
00:49:40,955 --> 00:49:44,454
- That was the first time.
- First time.

566
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:50,207
What would be your line of work, sir?

567
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:53,589
I was in the implement business
up in the Shonkin Sag,

568
00:49:53,717 --> 00:49:57,086
but I started back in the ranch
south of here.

569
00:49:58,138 --> 00:50:01,638
You started back in? You was before...?

570
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:06,180
My family used to have a place,
but when they lost it I hired out.

571
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:08,389
Oh, I see.

572
00:50:08,524 --> 00:50:12,652
I certainly wish you
good fortune, Mr Logan.

573
00:50:12,778 --> 00:50:15,269
The times are hard on a small operator.

574
00:50:15,406 --> 00:50:17,279
Heyah!

575
00:50:19,243 --> 00:50:22,279
I hope the damn horse thieves
leave you something.

576
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:25,698
- I hope so too.
- Good day to you, sir.

577
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:28,121
Bye-bye now.

578
00:50:28,252 --> 00:50:32,000
This colt of yours will be all right
if you can find a wet mare.

579
00:50:32,131 --> 00:50:34,170
- Is the mother dead?
- Yeah.

580
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:38,297
She got bogged down in a mire
about a mile from here.

581
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:42,213
- See you later, Tom. Thanks.
- All right, Mr Braxton.

582
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:45,019
Damn those hands of mine.

583
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,309
Good luck, Old Sloppy.

584
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:03,491
Must have smelled something.

585
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:08,448
The closer you get towards Canada,
the more things eat your horses.

586
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:13,087
Probably smelled a bear or a cat
or some damn thing.

587
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:15,918
Either one would go ahead
and eat your horse...

588
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:18,089
Whoa...

589
00:51:21,847 --> 00:51:27,303
Damn! I don't know why they had
to put Canada way the hell up here.

590
00:51:37,863 --> 00:51:40,235
Well, hello, Jane.

591
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:43,406
Hello, Tom.

592
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:46,868
I didn't think I'd find you here.

593
00:51:46,997 --> 00:51:51,077
- Why'd you think that?
- Cos I haven't seen you.

594
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:56,121
You thought I was gonna
come courtin', didn't ya?

595
00:51:56,256 --> 00:51:58,664
Maybe so. Mm-hm.

596
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:03,297
You was too harsh to me last time.
I never kick a dead horse, lady.

597
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:12,687
That sure is some garden you've started
here. Have you had one before?

598
00:52:12,815 --> 00:52:16,682
No. My aunt had one
and I kinda took it over.

599
00:52:17,903 --> 00:52:20,441
I ain't half bad at it though.

600
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:22,612
(chuckles) No.

601
00:52:25,744 --> 00:52:28,911
Why don't you get down off your horse?

602
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:31,079
I will, thank you.

603
00:52:35,003 --> 00:52:39,131
You're a lot nicer than you was before.
Why is that?

604
00:52:40,926 --> 00:52:45,967
Well, you didn't come courtin' me
like I figured you would, and...

605
00:52:46,098 --> 00:52:48,340
I'm...

606
00:52:48,475 --> 00:52:50,717
You're what?

607
00:52:50,853 --> 00:52:54,103
I'm tryin' to revive your interest.

608
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:56,900
Oh, yeah?

609
00:52:57,025 --> 00:53:01,771
Well... come here a minute
and I'll show you something.

610
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:09,283
All right.

611
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:12,245
Now lift that up.

612
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,459
(water starts flowing)

613
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:25,925
(Jane laughs)

614
00:53:28,098 --> 00:53:31,265
Close her down. Garden's watered.

615
00:53:34,605 --> 00:53:37,475
I admire you.

616
00:53:37,608 --> 00:53:42,151
Come in the house.
I'll make you a cup of chinee tea.

617
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:44,318
Chinese tea?

618
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,878
Northern Pacific Railroad.
Where did you get these?

619
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:01,043
Just souvenirs.

620
00:54:08,847 --> 00:54:10,887
Mm...

621
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,721
How long does the tea take?

622
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:17,095
Five or ten minutes.

623
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,316
Can I come over there?

624
00:54:28,283 --> 00:54:31,368
I'll come over there if you ask me to.

625
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:41,034
Let's go over there.

626
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:49,502
You sure about that?

627
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:54,639
That's right.

628
00:54:56,812 --> 00:54:59,682
How do you know you're sure about that?

629
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:03,058
Well, why do you think?

630
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:09,941
Cos that's the reason why
you come out here in the first place.

631
00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:13,825
That's right.

632
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:19,620
This here tea's gonna get black as ink.

633
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,166
We'll write somebody a letter with it.

634
00:55:29,928 --> 00:55:32,846
Let's write your father a letter.

635
00:55:32,973 --> 00:55:37,718
Tell him that you're the prisoner
of the chinee tea slavers.

636
00:56:11,928 --> 00:56:14,799
Would you like to do this?

637
00:56:17,476 --> 00:56:20,726
Yeah... I would like to.

638
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:24,476
That's what I would like to do.

639
00:56:34,409 --> 00:56:36,449
Sorry.

640
00:57:11,696 --> 00:57:14,152
(bird calls)

641
00:57:14,282 --> 00:57:16,322
God.

642
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:18,860
God, God.

643
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:21,035
(shrill bird calls)

644
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,335
(mumbles)

645
00:57:33,218 --> 00:57:35,626
Sniper, sniper, sniper.

646
00:57:56,992 --> 00:57:59,317
(whistles imitating bird)

647
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:02,951
(bugle call)

648
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:23,510
Goddamn. They're pretty.

649
00:58:23,643 --> 00:58:27,475
Yeah. They're neat
little bastards, ain't they?

650
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:31,767
(Cal) Oh, boy. There's more of 'em
than I expected.

651
00:58:31,902 --> 00:58:35,650
(Little Tod) Yeah. Do you suppose
them catfish ever look up?

652
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,651
- Piss on them.
- From up here?

653
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,451
Sh!

654
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,824
Supposed to be
the best police in the world.

655
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,875
- They don't scare me.
- Me neither.

656
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:57,502
Let's take these horses to the home
of the brave and the land of the free.

657
00:58:57,636 --> 00:58:58,834
- Not today.
- What?

658
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:01,296
Not today!

659
00:59:01,431 --> 00:59:03,471
Goddamn.

660
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:13,230
I'm gonna have an awful lot of
explaining to do when I get home.

661
00:59:13,363 --> 00:59:16,981
But I'm not gonna lie my way
out of this one.

662
00:59:17,116 --> 00:59:19,358
Yes, I am.

663
00:59:19,494 --> 00:59:22,863
- Which one?
- I'm gonna lie my way out of it.

664
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,162
- Where'd she go?
- Who?

665
00:59:27,293 --> 00:59:30,164
- Your ma.
- Oh...

666
00:59:30,296 --> 00:59:35,005
Well, she listened very carefully
to my father for about three years,

667
00:59:35,134 --> 00:59:36,712
weighed every word,

668
00:59:36,844 --> 00:59:43,013
and then she up and ran off with the first
unreasonable man that she could find.

669
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:48,978
Wait a minute. Stop. This is a nice way
to ride, but I know a much better way.

670
00:59:50,149 --> 00:59:52,605
Where are you goin'?

671
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:00,948
Ooh!

672
01:00:02,161 --> 01:00:05,613
- Well, that is clever.
- Yeah.

673
01:00:05,748 --> 01:00:08,583
Would you say that this is lewd conduct?

674
01:00:09,544 --> 01:00:11,786
Well, I couldn't say for sure.

675
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:17,466
My father has a library full of law books,
cos he believes in the law.

676
01:00:17,593 --> 01:00:21,176
He says that we haven't got
any law up here yet.

677
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:25,090
What brings that to your mind?

678
01:00:25,226 --> 01:00:31,015
Because in one of those law books of his,
there's a whole section on lewd conduct.

679
01:00:31,149 --> 01:00:35,063
- What about it?
- It's against the law.

680
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:44,906
Are you an outlaw?

681
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:54,838
I'm a jackpot rancher with a milk cow and
100 square foot of root vegetables. Why?

682
01:00:54,964 --> 01:00:59,258
- Why do you have so many guns?
- Because I'm a sportsman.

683
01:01:01,012 --> 01:01:03,882
Why do you have a sawed-off shotgun?

684
01:01:04,891 --> 01:01:08,390
Well, because I'm a sawed-off sportsman.

685
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:10,512
(chuckles)

686
01:01:10,647 --> 01:01:13,897
Well, something has sure
started in my thinking,

687
01:01:14,025 --> 01:01:19,481
and I don't know why we should go on
if you're just gonna end up dead.

688
01:01:20,823 --> 01:01:23,112
Whoa.

689
01:01:23,242 --> 01:01:28,035
Can we get down here
for a while and talk?

690
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:33,211
- Yeah. OK.
- You can make it?

691
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,950
(distant singing)

692
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,333
(Mounties) * When the trumpet of the Lord
shall sound and time shall be no more

693
01:02:20,466 --> 01:02:24,381
* And the morning breaks
eternal, bright and fair

694
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:28,462
* And the chosen ones shall gather
over on the other shore

695
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:32,727
* And the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

696
01:02:32,854 --> 01:02:37,101
* When the roll is called up yonder

697
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:41,527
* When the roll is called up yonder...

698
01:02:41,654 --> 01:02:45,699
Now they've locked in with Jesus.
Let's do it.

699
01:02:45,825 --> 01:02:52,029
- Makes me feel real safe and peaceful.
- Well, that's what Sundays are for.

700
01:03:39,378 --> 01:03:42,794
(Mounties sing
"Bringing In the Sheaves")

701
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:29,091
For the best police in the world,
Mounties are dumber than sticks.

702
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,797
We just left 'em nothin'.

703
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,136
Ha-ha! Whoo!

704
01:04:38,646 --> 01:04:40,685
(scraping)

705
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:55,735
Damn.

706
01:04:55,872 --> 01:04:59,655
Shouldn't crawl up on people like that.

707
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:03,042
Well, I'm not the crawlin' kind.

708
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:07,998
I was just passin' by and I thought
I'd ask you a question or two.

709
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:12,511
There was a family of Logans
out of Kaycee, Wyoming.

710
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:16,007
There was four brothers.
The youngest was a kid named Lonnie.

711
01:05:16,142 --> 01:05:18,300
They was all pretty quick,

712
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:21,140
except for Lonnie -
he was a fiddle player, and...

713
01:05:21,272 --> 01:05:23,727
They killed him off right quick.

714
01:05:23,858 --> 01:05:27,523
Some of the ranchers had found him
thievin' or something like that.

715
01:05:27,653 --> 01:05:32,315
Anyway, I was wonderin'...
would they be kin to ya?

716
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,323
No. No.

717
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:38,912
Well, I didn't think so
because you don't carry a gun.

718
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,079
No, I never carry a gun.

719
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:45,829
I never wear a gun neither.

720
01:05:45,963 --> 01:05:50,590
Oh, once in a while I carry
this little darlin' around.

721
01:05:50,718 --> 01:05:55,179
She's almost like a poem.
You know, it's all hand-done.

722
01:05:55,306 --> 01:05:57,631
Etched, you know, scratched in silver.

723
01:05:57,767 --> 01:06:00,851
Oh, she's a beauty.
Made for the president of Mexico.

724
01:06:00,978 --> 01:06:03,386
I diverted it for a hundred-dollar bill.

725
01:06:03,522 --> 01:06:06,393
But it doesn't shoot worth a damn.

726
01:06:08,277 --> 01:06:13,864
Some damn fool came along
and filed off the top of the front sight.

727
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:19,702
And you have to sort of play with it.

728
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,166
It isn't easy.

729
01:06:26,295 --> 01:06:28,620
Have a look at the rope.

730
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:34,469
Not bad.

731
01:06:34,595 --> 01:06:36,635
There's one left.

732
01:06:45,064 --> 01:06:47,103
I doubt it.

733
01:07:05,584 --> 01:07:07,624
You're smart.

734
01:07:09,922 --> 01:07:11,962
Farmers ain't smart.

735
01:07:12,091 --> 01:07:15,626
I don't know exactly where you came
from or what you were doing,

736
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:21,846
but I think you ought to go back to it,
because you can't farm worth spit.

737
01:07:25,813 --> 01:07:29,478
Unless... unless you lost your nerve.

738
01:07:30,484 --> 01:07:35,230
In that case, cabbages
is just what the doctor ordered.

739
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:45,746
Is your nerve gone?

740
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,330
(sings) Is your nerve gone?

741
01:07:51,922 --> 01:07:53,962
Yah!

742
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,550
Easy, easy!

743
01:08:02,892 --> 01:08:06,592
We're home, boys. We'll bed down soon.

744
01:08:06,729 --> 01:08:09,398
How we gonna get 'em
to swim across the Mighty Mo?

745
01:08:09,523 --> 01:08:12,441
If you can get one or two to go,
they'll all go.

746
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:15,652
Here's the breaks. Come on!

747
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,531
Back in the USA! What a relief.

748
01:08:22,828 --> 01:08:24,073
Hey!

749
01:08:24,705 --> 01:08:26,745
Slow, boys.

750
01:08:29,293 --> 01:08:31,084
(gunshot)

751
01:08:31,212 --> 01:08:32,670
Mounties!

752
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:37,295
Come on. Let's get outta here.

753
01:08:37,426 --> 01:08:39,300
Get down.

754
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,554
Let's get outta here.

755
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:47,390
Come on! Yah! Yah!

756
01:08:51,273 --> 01:08:53,396
(gunshot)

757
01:08:55,486 --> 01:08:57,146
Agh!

758
01:09:03,452 --> 01:09:05,492
Let's go! Let's go!

759
01:09:38,445 --> 01:09:42,028
Wonder where Little Tod
got himself off to.

760
01:09:43,576 --> 01:09:45,615
I don't know.

761
01:09:46,912 --> 01:09:50,032
I don't know where my finger is either.

762
01:09:50,624 --> 01:09:56,579
Them Mounties... followed us
right into the United States of America,

763
01:09:56,714 --> 01:09:58,753
got their horses back.

764
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:02,375
It's not even legal!

765
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:09,883
Tie that hand up and let's move. Maybe
we'll meet Little Tod at the Snake's Cross.

766
01:10:11,812 --> 01:10:13,686
(yells)

767
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:33,663
(squawks)

768
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:36,852
Come on.

769
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:39,020
Come on. Go! Go!

770
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:39,707
Whoa, there.

771
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:41,828
(laughs)

772
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:48,633
Do you always get off
your horse that way?

773
01:12:50,763 --> 01:12:53,550
I'm not chasin' you.

774
01:12:53,682 --> 01:12:58,095
- Who did you think was after you?
- This is the haunt of thieves and killers.

775
01:12:58,228 --> 01:13:00,470
Oh, shit. Here.

776
01:13:01,273 --> 01:13:07,358
This ain't the haunt of nothin' but
diamondbacks and old farts like me.

777
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:12,070
- Who are ya?
- My name's Jim Ferguson.

778
01:13:13,077 --> 01:13:15,698
I'm pleased to meet you.
What's your name?

779
01:13:15,829 --> 01:13:17,786
Tod La Frambois.

780
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:19,954
La Frambois.

781
01:13:21,335 --> 01:13:24,953
- What's your trade, Mr La Frambois?
- Trade?

782
01:13:25,089 --> 01:13:29,466
Well, I been in the...
farm implement business.

783
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:34,932
Now I'm lookin' to get on with the ranch.
Maybe down around Absaroka.

784
01:13:35,641 --> 01:13:38,096
That'd be over that way.

785
01:13:43,982 --> 01:13:48,395
I tell you what. I got a nice hare
on a stick over here.

786
01:13:50,531 --> 01:13:52,570
Let's go have a bite to eat.

787
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:55,369
- Well... thank you.
- Come on.

788
01:14:02,918 --> 01:14:04,958
(strums mandolin)

789
01:14:06,338 --> 01:14:12,341
* Life is like a mountain railway

790
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:19,347
* With an engineer that's brave

791
01:14:20,269 --> 01:14:26,888
* We must make this run successful

792
01:14:27,025 --> 01:14:34,072
* From the cradle to the grave

793
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:40,949
* Heed the curves, the fills, the tunnels

794
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:46,324
* Never falter, never quail

795
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:48,335
Never quail.

796
01:14:48,463 --> 01:14:54,632
* Keep your hand upon the throttle

797
01:14:54,761 --> 01:15:01,215
* And your eye upon the rail

798
01:15:03,353 --> 01:15:05,595
- Sweet song.
- Yeah.

799
01:15:07,941 --> 01:15:13,315
Do you believe that life is like
a mountain railroad, Mr La Frambois?

800
01:15:14,656 --> 01:15:17,741
All I know, Jim, is that...

801
01:15:17,868 --> 01:15:21,319
life is not like anything I ever seen before.

802
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:25,288
Yes.

803
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:32,626
It's really strange runnin' into a preacher
out here, in this hellhole.

804
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:37,885
I believe that life is
like a mountain railway,

805
01:15:38,013 --> 01:15:41,464
but not for the reasons in the song.

806
01:15:42,309 --> 01:15:44,717
I think life is like a mountain railway

807
01:15:44,853 --> 01:15:50,358
cos you don't have no idea what sleazy
son of a bitch got his hand on the throttle.

808
01:15:50,484 --> 01:15:54,316
That's a real strange attitude
for a preacher.

809
01:15:58,575 --> 01:16:01,066
Yep.

810
01:16:01,203 --> 01:16:03,658
I ain't no preacher.

811
01:16:09,503 --> 01:16:11,294
What do you do?

812
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:15,336
I'm about a quarter-ass horse thief.

813
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:18,918
Anything to get some grits in my stomach.

814
01:16:19,054 --> 01:16:21,806
Not doin' too good at it neither.

815
01:16:21,932 --> 01:16:25,301
Otherwise I wouldn't be eatin' hare.

816
01:16:25,435 --> 01:16:27,891
I'd be in Dodge City,

817
01:16:28,021 --> 01:16:31,853
playin' with them big asses,
drinkin' champagne.

818
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:34,396
(chuckles)

819
01:16:34,528 --> 01:16:38,063
What about yourself there, Tod?

820
01:16:38,198 --> 01:16:40,191
What do you do?

821
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:46,364
Well, there's really nothin' to say.
I'm a single man. Implement business.

822
01:16:48,834 --> 01:16:52,701
- Where you got this implement business?
- It's in Big Sandy.

823
01:16:52,838 --> 01:16:55,411
No, I mean the Shonkin Sag.

824
01:16:55,549 --> 01:16:58,300
- No, I mean Big Sandy. Big...
- (laughs)

825
01:17:01,555 --> 01:17:04,390
I was raised up in Big Sandy.

826
01:17:04,516 --> 01:17:08,845
There ain't a teeny-weeny
implement business in Big Sandy,

827
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:11,648
and not in Shonkin Sag neither.

828
01:17:13,984 --> 01:17:19,061
Mr Ferguson, I'm really grateful to you
for your hospitality and everything,

829
01:17:19,197 --> 01:17:22,317
but my line of work is
none of your damn business.

830
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:27,029
I'm sorry, Tod. I didn't mean
to get you all riled up like that.

831
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:29,536
I'll tell you what.

832
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:34,577
Maybe one of these days, I'll get
a chance to cook your supper for you.

833
01:17:34,713 --> 01:17:38,296
Hah! Hooray for a free dang meal.

834
01:17:40,469 --> 01:17:41,749
Good.

835
01:17:41,887 --> 01:17:43,926
Thank God.

836
01:17:49,603 --> 01:17:52,224
I hope you keep my business
to yourself too.

837
01:17:52,356 --> 01:17:54,644
Hey. You got my word.

838
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:58,188
That's good enough. (hums)

839
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:28,135
(snoring)

840
01:18:44,116 --> 01:18:47,485
What the hell's goin' on here?

841
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:51,368
Goddamn. What the hell's
the matter with you?

842
01:18:51,498 --> 01:18:54,831
Something... I don't know...

843
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,747
Tryin' to get some sleep here.

844
01:19:09,641 --> 01:19:13,010
I want you to cinch up good
on the knot there.

845
01:19:13,145 --> 01:19:16,181
- Yeah, I did.
- All right, now don't have fear.

846
01:19:16,314 --> 01:19:19,185
This is the way my daddy taught me, now.

847
01:19:21,653 --> 01:19:24,689
Easy aces, now. Come on.

848
01:19:24,823 --> 01:19:27,065
Come on.

849
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:33,618
- This is the part I hate. I can't swim a lick.
- Come on.

850
01:19:33,749 --> 01:19:35,788
- What do I do?
- Now slide off.

851
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:39,618
Slide off. Let her go.
Let the horse go. Don't hold on.

852
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:42,590
- That's it. Now we're doin' it.
- Whoo-hoo!

853
01:19:42,716 --> 01:19:45,385
I got you now.

854
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,550
Damn!

855
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:52,132
- Hell, this is easy.
- Up on that beast now.

856
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,969
You're halfway to the barn now, laddie.

857
01:19:56,104 --> 01:19:58,642
- Halfway.
- Yee-hah!

858
01:19:58,774 --> 01:20:02,142
Come on! We've cut that son of a bitch.

859
01:20:04,362 --> 01:20:07,447
We cut that goddamn thing
slicker than butter.

860
01:20:07,574 --> 01:20:10,943
Listen, you go on ahead now.

861
01:20:11,077 --> 01:20:14,031
You go on over there
and I'll secure the rope here.

862
01:20:14,164 --> 01:20:16,453
- You got a good hold on that?
- Yeah.

863
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:22,087
You get goin' now, and then you pull me
in case something happens to me.

864
01:20:22,214 --> 01:20:24,253
Yah!

865
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:27,049
Let her go now.

866
01:20:27,552 --> 01:20:29,592
I don't know about this.

867
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,631
That's it. Go ahead.

868
01:20:34,768 --> 01:20:35,847
In you go.

869
01:20:35,977 --> 01:20:38,599
Damn horse won't swim. Come on.

870
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,517
- Dig your heels in now.
- This isn't bad at all.

871
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:42,764
Yah!

872
01:20:43,652 --> 01:20:45,644
I can't swim. Bring me in.

873
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:48,696
Now, you dirt turkey,
are you gonna talk to me?

874
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:51,611
You gonna tell me somethin' now?

875
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:56,571
Listen, son, you got two choices now.
Drink this muddy son of a bitch,

876
01:20:56,706 --> 01:20:59,660
or tell me about Tom Logan
and your goddamn rustlin'.

877
01:20:59,793 --> 01:21:02,200
You... You son...

878
01:21:02,337 --> 01:21:05,706
- I'm gonna give you one...
- I'm not gonna say anything.

879
01:21:05,841 --> 01:21:08,296
Mr La Frambois, one.

880
01:21:11,012 --> 01:21:12,175
Agh!

881
01:21:22,732 --> 01:21:24,974
Adios, amigo.

882
01:22:00,645 --> 01:22:02,685
(neighs)

883
01:22:03,773 --> 01:22:05,849
That's Little Tod's horse.

884
01:22:05,984 --> 01:22:08,226
Damned if it ain't.

885
01:22:13,116 --> 01:22:16,319
What happened?
Did he get bucked off or what?

886
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,160
- I don't know.
- Cal?

887
01:22:22,834 --> 01:22:26,001
- What is it?
- What the hell's goin' on?

888
01:22:26,129 --> 01:22:28,335
Let's get inside.

889
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:35,924
- What's happening?
- Lee Clayton. Lee Clayton!

890
01:22:39,559 --> 01:22:43,972
Come here, Sandy, old girl.
We're goin' to a picnic.

891
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:49,106
(Clayton whistling)

892
01:22:51,363 --> 01:22:53,154
He never will close that gate.

893
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:56,864
It wasn't near as gloomy around here
when we only had rustlers.

894
01:22:56,993 --> 01:23:01,157
Never seen nothin' like him. Come on.

895
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:05,287
Never thought Mr Braxton
would call in a man like that.

896
01:23:10,423 --> 01:23:12,463
(laughs)

897
01:23:15,303 --> 01:23:18,553
I presume you've had an enlightening trip.

898
01:23:18,682 --> 01:23:20,425
Mm...

899
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:25,137
Well, what kind of trip did you have?

900
01:23:28,274 --> 01:23:30,812
What did you learn?

901
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:36,780
Lower your voice. I feel an attack of gas
and that could be perilous to both of us.

902
01:23:36,908 --> 01:23:39,150
(farts) That's good.

903
01:23:43,373 --> 01:23:45,864
What did you learn?

904
01:23:48,586 --> 01:23:53,332
The one man that could have told me
something didn't tell me nothing,

905
01:23:53,466 --> 01:23:57,298
and then he upped and drowned himself
in the Missouri River.

906
01:23:59,097 --> 01:24:01,588
You've got no further
than we did without you.

907
01:24:01,725 --> 01:24:05,674
Oh, I can track a bluebottle fly
right up your nose.

908
01:24:05,812 --> 01:24:09,679
And I've taken to trackin'
what people are thinkin'.

909
01:24:09,816 --> 01:24:12,141
Where's your wife?

910
01:24:12,277 --> 01:24:14,946
What has that got to... Damn it!

911
01:24:15,989 --> 01:24:18,444
I detest your impertinence.

912
01:24:18,575 --> 01:24:23,201
You stay out of my private life,
you lilac-smellin' son of a bitch.

913
01:24:25,123 --> 01:24:28,741
You ain't the first mental wizard
I ever met, you know.

914
01:24:28,877 --> 01:24:32,411
I've met ranchers, outlaws,
stock detectives

915
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:36,414
who thought they was
mental wizards like yourself.

916
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:40,762
There was one thing I could
never understand and that was...

917
01:24:40,889 --> 01:24:44,174
"Why can't they hang on to their women?"

918
01:24:44,309 --> 01:24:48,141
You're beginning to rave.
And you're beginning to bore me.

919
01:24:48,271 --> 01:24:50,347
So you're gonna stop.

920
01:24:50,482 --> 01:24:53,436
You're gonna stop spying on me
and on my family.

921
01:24:53,568 --> 01:24:55,857
You were never hired to do that.

922
01:24:55,987 --> 01:24:58,395
I do not, and Jane does not,

923
01:24:58,531 --> 01:25:02,363
and the dozen dolts who work for me
do not steal horses.

924
01:25:04,496 --> 01:25:07,532
But somebody does, don't he?

925
01:25:20,595 --> 01:25:22,635
(hoof beats)

926
01:25:29,938 --> 01:25:33,389
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.

927
01:25:34,484 --> 01:25:36,393
- Cal!
- Long time, Logan.

928
01:25:36,528 --> 01:25:40,608
Cal, I want you to meet
a good friend of mine. Jane Braxton.

929
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:44,026
- How do?
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

930
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,494
She was born and bred here, Cal,
and ready for city lights.

931
01:25:47,622 --> 01:25:50,956
Pretty ladies should have what they want.

932
01:25:51,084 --> 01:25:54,369
- How's the ranch comin', Tom?
- You want a tour?

933
01:25:55,922 --> 01:25:58,413
Sure do.

934
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:01,005
I'll see you later. Bye.

935
01:26:11,646 --> 01:26:15,264
Cal, come on, I'll show you the orchard.
Come on, buddy.

936
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,100
This little bastard was
in sorry shape before I got to it.

937
01:26:19,237 --> 01:26:23,982
These trees wouldn't have turned out
a peck of apples apiece.

938
01:26:24,117 --> 01:26:28,695
No wonder that guy's makin' barrels in
town. He wasn't running this place right.

939
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:31,747
This tree was all full of scale and blight.

940
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:38,244
These limbs I dug out of here had borers
in 'em and insect eggs all over everything.

941
01:26:38,381 --> 01:26:40,208
It was...

942
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,388
Little Tod didn't come home.

943
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:55,394
What the hell are you doin'?

944
01:26:55,523 --> 01:27:01,608
What difference does it make whether
blight or borers eat up this whole ranch?

945
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:06,659
Well, Cal, I just have to say it.

946
01:27:08,912 --> 01:27:12,197
I'd prefer that they didn't ruin the orchard.

947
01:27:24,385 --> 01:27:26,841
Poor Little Tod.

948
01:27:44,572 --> 01:27:47,407
Gimme that cartridge.

949
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:55,791
That girl's old man
hired Lee Clayton, didn't he?

950
01:27:57,961 --> 01:28:00,748
Yeah. He did.

951
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,415
What about her? Where's her husband at?

952
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:08,050
She don't have a husband.
She don't need one.

953
01:28:08,179 --> 01:28:10,931
She don't need one.

954
01:28:11,057 --> 01:28:14,592
Boy, you're pretty far gone, ain't ya?

955
01:28:14,727 --> 01:28:20,101
- It's the way it happens, isn't it, Cal?
- I wouldn't know.

956
01:28:20,233 --> 01:28:23,981
Not since that dog of mine
put his tongue on the butter.

957
01:28:45,758 --> 01:28:47,798
Where's Lee Clayton? Is he here?

958
01:28:47,927 --> 01:28:52,256
You betcha. Moved right in.
Made himself at home. Boy!

959
01:28:55,268 --> 01:28:57,307
Robert Lee?

960
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,656
(Clayton singing)

961
01:29:21,961 --> 01:29:24,203
Robert Lee.

962
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:33,926
You know, the old man built this tub
for the old lady, and she ran out on him.

963
01:29:34,057 --> 01:29:37,223
Wasn't that you callin' me out there?

964
01:29:37,351 --> 01:29:39,889
Yes, son. That was me.

965
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:42,808
There's no way you can win, you know.

966
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:43,972
What?

967
01:29:44,108 --> 01:29:45,935
- There's no way you can win.
- Win?

968
01:29:46,069 --> 01:29:49,769
It's kin of mine is all
that calls me Robert Lee.

969
01:29:49,906 --> 01:29:52,231
I'm going to bust your fat ass.

970
01:29:54,118 --> 01:29:58,496
How am I to get my nourishment
spending my dinner hour here with you?

971
01:29:58,623 --> 01:30:03,664
You ain't gonna get no nourishment.
You're gonna dry up and blow away.

972
01:30:08,841 --> 01:30:11,511
It just ain't in the cards, angel.

973
01:30:11,636 --> 01:30:15,135
Can't you see that the list
is as long as my arm?

974
01:30:15,264 --> 01:30:17,755
You're under the headin'
of what I do for a livin'.

975
01:30:17,892 --> 01:30:22,186
Now step outside, because
my stomach has commenced to growl.

976
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,979
Are you scared?

977
01:30:28,027 --> 01:30:30,269
Shakin' all over.

978
01:30:30,405 --> 01:30:33,690
It's almost like I don't have a prayer.

979
01:30:34,742 --> 01:30:37,280
But I can't lose this appetite.
What ails me?

980
01:30:37,412 --> 01:30:42,204
You're floatin' there in your confirmation
dress waitin' for God to save ya.

981
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:46,378
Did it ever bother you, sittin' up there
in that cabin drinkin' coffee,

982
01:30:46,504 --> 01:30:51,047
while that fiddler's wife
was screamin' in the Sandwash?

983
01:30:52,927 --> 01:30:57,007
Well, first off... I don't drink coffee.

984
01:30:57,140 --> 01:31:00,140
Now can I climb out?
I'm hungry for my supper.

985
01:31:00,268 --> 01:31:03,518
Where's your Creedmore at, Robert Lee?

986
01:31:03,646 --> 01:31:07,774
Where's your cabbage-shootin' Mexican
pistola with flowers on the handle?

987
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,735
Why don't you go get it?

988
01:31:11,821 --> 01:31:14,359
That settles it.

989
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:16,364
I'm not that hungry

990
01:31:16,492 --> 01:31:21,403
and I'll stay here till someone fetches me
who cares about my welfare.

991
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:25,157
- I deplore...
- Get up, you dry-gulchin' piece of slime.

992
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:27,416
A little bathe in the tub here...

993
01:31:27,545 --> 01:31:29,169
Get up!

994
01:31:29,672 --> 01:31:31,581
Get up!

995
01:31:31,716 --> 01:31:35,927
I want to lie here and lose.
No dinner. No nothing.

996
01:31:41,893 --> 01:31:43,470
Well?

997
01:31:58,326 --> 01:31:59,321
(gunshot)

998
01:31:59,452 --> 01:32:02,073
(water dripping)

999
01:32:09,003 --> 01:32:11,375
My God. You ain't even there.

1000
01:32:37,907 --> 01:32:39,946
Did you kill him?

1001
01:32:40,076 --> 01:32:46,446
No, I just emptied his tub. Somebody's
gonna have to do something about that.

1002
01:33:05,017 --> 01:33:07,057
What's become of Tom?

1003
01:33:08,896 --> 01:33:11,933
- Isn't he on his place?
- No, he's not.

1004
01:33:12,066 --> 01:33:16,692
Well, that's not what I call ranching.
I know what you're driving at.

1005
01:33:16,821 --> 01:33:20,818
All I can tell you is that things have
been nearly as bad as they could be.

1006
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:24,995
If those two men have reason to look
for one another, I'm not interfering.

1007
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:27,612
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him.

1008
01:33:27,748 --> 01:33:29,326
No.

1009
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:31,949
You can't.

1010
01:33:32,086 --> 01:33:34,043
I won't.

1011
01:33:34,839 --> 01:33:37,959
I hope that you choke on that.

1012
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:43,555
You don't mean that, darling.

1013
01:33:44,724 --> 01:33:46,965
- Vern, scat.
- You betcha.

1014
01:33:48,352 --> 01:33:51,555
I wouldn't have hired Lee
if the rustlers hadn't killed Pete.

1015
01:33:51,689 --> 01:33:54,809
This has nothing to do with Pete,
law, or stealing horses.

1016
01:33:54,942 --> 01:33:58,062
- Then what does it have to do with?
- Tom Logan.

1017
01:33:58,195 --> 01:34:00,521
Tom Logan.

1018
01:34:01,657 --> 01:34:06,615
- I never even think about him.
- You can't bear me being with him.

1019
01:34:06,746 --> 01:34:12,286
Now, Daddy, goddamn it.
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him!

1020
01:34:12,418 --> 01:34:16,996
You think I couldn't bear living here alone,
don't you? Start me thinking.

1021
01:34:17,131 --> 01:34:19,171
No... No.

1022
01:34:20,551 --> 01:34:23,172
No, I won't. I won't.

1023
01:34:26,849 --> 01:34:30,016
- (horse snorts)
- (Logan) Whoa, Buck.

1024
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,849
- Oh...
- What the hell are you doin'?

1025
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:38,354
- Cal's got me lookin' out for Lee Clayton.
- Come on down. Old Buck come up lame.

1026
01:34:38,486 --> 01:34:42,697
Gimme a hand. Goddamn it.
Easy, Buck. Come on now.

1027
01:34:43,532 --> 01:34:47,577
Only goddamn intelligent horse.
Easy, boy.

1028
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,119
I had him.

1029
01:34:56,796 --> 01:35:02,501
You think anybody could do it?
I mean... an ordinary fella?

1030
01:35:06,389 --> 01:35:08,428
I don't know.

1031
01:35:10,685 --> 01:35:15,643
Seems like somebody oughta
be able to get the job done.

1032
01:35:15,773 --> 01:35:18,228
Just watch it is all.

1033
01:35:21,237 --> 01:35:23,988
I'll tell you one thing, though.

1034
01:35:25,074 --> 01:35:27,113
Don't start talkin' to him.

1035
01:35:27,243 --> 01:35:30,612
I don't care what the plan is,
as long as you get us outta here.

1036
01:35:30,746 --> 01:35:35,455
That's what I'd like.
Let's just pull our socks up and get out.

1037
01:35:35,584 --> 01:35:38,336
We're gonna hit Braxton.

1038
01:35:38,462 --> 01:35:42,840
We're gonna take everything he's got.
Blooded stock an' all.

1039
01:35:42,967 --> 01:35:46,585
- That's the least we can do.
- And maybe flush us a regulator.

1040
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:49,638
I would love to include the old man.

1041
01:35:49,765 --> 01:35:52,470
A .44-40 in the brain
would be my sentence for him.

1042
01:35:52,601 --> 01:35:55,436
I don't know why you don't want
to go along with that.

1043
01:35:55,563 --> 01:35:56,973
I'd just sooner we didn't.

1044
01:35:57,106 --> 01:36:00,724
I wanna know on what grounds
you don't wanna shoot Braxton!

1045
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:04,359
We ain't gonna do it
because I said we ain't gonna do it!

1046
01:36:06,323 --> 01:36:08,530
Am I perfectly clear on that, Cal?

1047
01:36:08,659 --> 01:36:11,328
Goddamn it, let's not start that stuff.

1048
01:36:11,454 --> 01:36:15,072
Really, Tom, it's only
gonna wreck the whole job.

1049
01:36:15,207 --> 01:36:17,247
Cal?

1050
01:36:30,181 --> 01:36:33,715
Hey, Woodruff.
Braxton got you nighthawking.

1051
01:36:33,851 --> 01:36:36,306
Mr Logan, what you doin'
out of bed at this hour?

1052
01:36:36,437 --> 01:36:41,063
Lookin' for a better life, Woodruff. What
do you know that's new and exciting?

1053
01:36:41,192 --> 01:36:45,320
- Same old thing.
- What do you got in here?

1054
01:36:45,446 --> 01:36:47,771
Oh...

1055
01:36:47,907 --> 01:36:49,069
37.

1056
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:52,284
And I got the walkin' horse, but...

1057
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:56,490
You're gonna take 'em.

1058
01:36:56,624 --> 01:36:59,993
You bet. You wanna get down now?

1059
01:37:00,127 --> 01:37:05,252
And reach me over that bird's head Colt
you got stuck in your shirt there.

1060
01:37:05,382 --> 01:37:08,549
Butt first, if you please, Woodruff.

1061
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:32,653
- You think you're smart, don't you?
- Well, I ain't dumb and I ain't tied up.

1062
01:37:33,744 --> 01:37:35,950
You just lay on that soft spot.

1063
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,780
- You're slicker than snot on a door knob.
- Thank you, Cary.

1064
01:37:44,922 --> 01:37:46,961
I tell you one goddamn thing.

1065
01:37:47,091 --> 01:37:52,963
Old Braxton's gonna be one
surprised-assed son of a bitch, ain't he?

1066
01:37:54,431 --> 01:37:59,936
I regret Pete Marker wasn't here
to get the news, that sorry bag of shit.

1067
01:38:00,062 --> 01:38:03,597
We'll see him in hell, that son of a bitch.

1068
01:38:03,732 --> 01:38:07,944
Shut up, Si, or you'll push these horses
all the way down to Kansas without us.

1069
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:11,653
Let's push, boys. I feel eyes all over us.

1070
01:38:32,761 --> 01:38:37,174
That relay ranch is dead.
Anybody got a preferred district?

1071
01:38:37,308 --> 01:38:39,549
- Hellsgate for me.
- Big Hole.

1072
01:38:39,685 --> 01:38:42,639
Big Hole. I'll meet you there. Cal?

1073
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:46,262
Dodge Pole. Shit, that's all that's left.

1074
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,436
- We'll meet back at the old cabin. Cary?
- All right.

1075
01:38:49,570 --> 01:38:53,983
Remember, I wanna get $20 a head
for these or we're doing this job...

1076
01:39:08,589 --> 01:39:13,050
I could have picked off one or two of them
maybe, but we'd have lost the rest.

1077
01:39:13,177 --> 01:39:18,882
Supposin' you had a barn full of nasty
old bats. You wanted to get rid of them.

1078
01:39:19,016 --> 01:39:23,892
The worst thing you could do is just
get your gun and start shootin' around.

1079
01:39:24,021 --> 01:39:26,227
What good would it do you?

1080
01:39:26,357 --> 01:39:29,560
They'd leave and they'd be back
by 7.30 in the morning.

1081
01:39:29,693 --> 01:39:33,905
If you want to get rid of a whole lot
of evil bats, there's only one way.

1082
01:39:34,031 --> 01:39:38,029
And the way is this.
You wait till the dawn comes.

1083
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,743
About 4.30 and you're waitin'
outside by the barrels.

1084
01:39:41,872 --> 01:39:46,534
Then you close the door real quick
and all the bats are inside.

1085
01:39:46,669 --> 01:39:50,287
Then while they're sleepin',
the lovely little sweethearts,

1086
01:39:50,422 --> 01:39:53,874
you have every one of the dirty
little buggers at your mercy.

1087
01:39:54,009 --> 01:39:58,755
- That's the only way you can do it.
- That's all very informative.

1088
01:39:58,889 --> 01:40:01,345
But every horse I own is gone.

1089
01:40:01,475 --> 01:40:05,140
The only way you're going
to get paid is if I get them back.

1090
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:07,761
(laughs) Golly.

1091
01:40:07,898 --> 01:40:10,519
I don't care a damn about that. Come on.

1092
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:12,690
Always finish the work.

1093
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:17,612
And... I don't give a damn
whether or not I get paid.

1094
01:40:17,741 --> 01:40:23,826
And, uh... talkin' about horses, I think
I know the horse you're worrying about.

1095
01:40:23,956 --> 01:40:26,957
- He wears a black hat, he's two-legged...
- Shut up.

1096
01:40:27,084 --> 01:40:29,492
..and I think I know
where he stands at stud.

1097
01:40:29,628 --> 01:40:32,380
Shut up! You're out of control.
You're through.

1098
01:40:32,506 --> 01:40:34,831
I want you off the place. Now get!

1099
01:40:34,967 --> 01:40:37,968
Well, it is your place, sir.

1100
01:40:38,095 --> 01:40:42,804
But the work is mine
and I'll have the say about that.

1101
01:40:42,933 --> 01:40:44,178
(sings)

1102
01:40:44,309 --> 01:40:46,931
Come on, Jess.
We know when we're not wanted.

1103
01:40:47,062 --> 01:40:50,229
Let's go out to the bat hunt now.

1104
01:40:50,357 --> 01:40:55,897
You lazy no-good bastards, get back
to work or I'll fire every one of you!

1105
01:41:04,872 --> 01:41:06,911
(bird call)

1106
01:41:13,422 --> 01:41:16,376
They call this country Hellsgate.

1107
01:41:18,469 --> 01:41:23,546
When my dad came in here, it was
nothing but a bunch of savage Indians...

1108
01:41:23,682 --> 01:41:25,722
and Jesuits.

1109
01:41:27,978 --> 01:41:33,898
Old Thomas Jefferson said that he was
a warrior so his son could be a farmer,

1110
01:41:34,026 --> 01:41:36,695
so his son could be a poet.

1111
01:41:40,157 --> 01:41:44,285
I raise cattle
so my son can be a merchant,

1112
01:41:44,411 --> 01:41:47,412
so his son can move to Newport,
Rhode Island, buy a sailboat

1113
01:41:47,539 --> 01:41:53,743
and never see one of these bastard-assed
son-of-a-bitchin' mountains again.

1114
01:41:56,799 --> 01:41:59,254
Who was Thomas Jefferson?

1115
01:42:02,387 --> 01:42:05,057
Guy back east.

1116
01:42:08,435 --> 01:42:11,602
I'll bet you're about done in.
You had a long day.

1117
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:13,557
That's true.

1118
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:16,228
Mother, you wanna show
our boy the bunkhouse?

1119
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:20,144
Surely. I'll bring him a blanket.

1120
01:42:21,907 --> 01:42:24,659
I'll see you before
you start out in the morning.

1121
01:42:24,785 --> 01:42:26,991
Fine.

1122
01:42:27,121 --> 01:42:30,205
Let me thank you again
for selling me those horses.

1123
01:42:30,332 --> 01:42:32,372
It's my pleasure.

1124
01:42:33,418 --> 01:42:36,953
My compliments to the artist
that changed those brands.

1125
01:42:37,089 --> 01:42:39,378
Was it you?

1126
01:42:41,009 --> 01:42:45,387
I learned it from a nice boy from
Newport, Rhode Island, with no sailboat.

1127
01:42:45,514 --> 01:42:50,970
They hung him in a cottonwood south of
the Shonkin Sag, by the neck, until dead.

1128
01:43:02,364 --> 01:43:05,235
- You've got five minutes.
- OK. Sh.

1129
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:11,487
Wait. It would help if you got
out of your drawers altogether.

1130
01:43:11,623 --> 01:43:13,532
- No.
- Sh.

1131
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:18,376
- What good is it keepin' them on one leg?
- Why don't you shut up?

1132
01:43:19,464 --> 01:43:23,047
You've only got four of your minutes left.

1133
01:43:25,804 --> 01:43:29,090
Besides, I'm beginning to chafe.

1134
01:43:31,476 --> 01:43:33,303
Agh!

1135
01:43:34,146 --> 01:43:36,388
(screams)

1136
01:43:38,233 --> 01:43:42,101
- Hon? Honey?
- (continues screaming)

1137
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:55,580
(distant explosion)

1138
01:44:15,938 --> 01:44:18,511
Kid. Hey, kid.

1139
01:44:18,649 --> 01:44:21,685
Here's a buck. Go get me a whiskey
and the rest is yours.

1140
01:44:21,818 --> 01:44:25,353
- Good stuff. Go on. Hurry up.
- (distant explosion)

1141
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,657
Hurry up.

1142
01:44:35,165 --> 01:44:37,573
Thanks.

1143
01:45:02,192 --> 01:45:04,232
Hold these, junior.

1144
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:09,607
I won't be but a minute,
then we'll go get something to eat.

1145
01:45:19,751 --> 01:45:21,791
Hey!

1146
01:45:25,382 --> 01:45:28,336
Hey! Hey!

1147
01:45:33,098 --> 01:45:34,722
Hey!

1148
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:39,977
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:45:53,327 --> 01:45:56,197
I ain't got but $54, mister.

1150
01:45:56,329 --> 01:45:59,615
But I want all three horses or nothing.

1151
01:46:01,626 --> 01:46:03,868
What you got to trade?

1152
01:46:05,672 --> 01:46:07,712
A clarinet. (laughs)

1153
01:46:13,847 --> 01:46:16,682
All right, I'll take it.

1154
01:47:04,189 --> 01:47:06,228
(puffing)

1155
01:47:07,234 --> 01:47:09,273
(squeaky notes)

1156
01:47:36,388 --> 01:47:39,258
I can't use it. It looks too tight.

1157
01:47:44,146 --> 01:47:47,312
Here. Let me try it on.

1158
01:47:48,817 --> 01:47:52,400
Put your arm in. You can't tell till it's on.

1159
01:47:52,529 --> 01:47:55,067
Oh, it fits...

1160
01:47:55,699 --> 01:47:58,368
I don't want the goddamn thing.

1161
01:48:42,996 --> 01:48:45,321
(neighing)

1162
01:48:46,833 --> 01:48:48,956
(laughs)

1163
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:04,430
Smoked meat!

1164
01:49:15,779 --> 01:49:18,270
(groans)

1165
01:49:23,703 --> 01:49:26,325
Old smoked meat.

1166
01:49:33,755 --> 01:49:36,211
Where's Tom Logan?

1167
01:49:44,307 --> 01:49:47,474
I couldn't get him to come out.

1168
01:49:47,602 --> 01:49:49,642
God!

1169
01:49:53,358 --> 01:49:56,145
Too proud, huh?

1170
01:49:57,112 --> 01:49:59,151
I reckon.

1171
01:50:05,203 --> 01:50:07,077
(crashing)

1172
01:50:09,207 --> 01:50:12,825
I'd like about anything
but getting burned up.

1173
01:50:26,975 --> 01:50:31,186
Well, you're about
the last of your kind, old man.

1174
01:50:33,565 --> 01:50:36,850
If I was a better businessman
than I am a manhunter,

1175
01:50:36,985 --> 01:50:39,654
I'd put you in the circus.

1176
01:50:49,581 --> 01:50:54,871
You know, about this time of year -
Indian summer - gettin' there...

1177
01:50:55,003 --> 01:50:58,253
they say you can see
the Star of Bethlehem,

1178
01:50:58,381 --> 01:51:01,086
if you look real good.

1179
01:51:01,217 --> 01:51:06,971
I seen it once or twice. But you gotta look
away and then you gotta look at it, see?

1180
01:51:07,098 --> 01:51:10,930
You gotta look at it
just a minute, like that, see?

1181
01:51:13,396 --> 01:51:15,887
See what I mean?

1182
01:51:39,422 --> 01:51:43,752
Well, old Granny's gettin' tired now.

1183
01:51:52,852 --> 01:51:54,892
(Clayton singing)

1184
01:52:45,029 --> 01:52:46,572
(neighing)

1185
01:52:51,703 --> 01:52:53,742
Cal?

1186
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,499
Si?

1187
01:53:14,809 --> 01:53:17,561
Oh... Oh...

1188
01:53:20,106 --> 01:53:22,478
Oh, my God.

1189
01:54:18,164 --> 01:54:19,279
(kisses)

1190
01:54:19,415 --> 01:54:21,455
No. Kiss first.

1191
01:54:22,669 --> 01:54:24,708
Kiss first.

1192
01:54:29,884 --> 01:54:32,636
You have the lips of Salome,

1193
01:54:32,762 --> 01:54:35,218
and the eyes of Cleopatra.

1194
01:54:40,436 --> 01:54:42,476
(humming)

1195
01:54:44,566 --> 01:54:46,392
(plays harmonica)

1196
01:54:47,944 --> 01:54:52,902
I dedicate this song
to the only woman I ever loved.

1197
01:54:56,286 --> 01:55:00,330
I'm too shy to turn around
and say it to your face,

1198
01:55:00,456 --> 01:55:03,541
but I mean it from my heart.

1199
01:55:03,668 --> 01:55:05,957
I don't love you, you harlot.

1200
01:55:06,087 --> 01:55:10,001
I'm not even speaking to you.
Do you know that?

1201
01:55:13,136 --> 01:55:15,841
Come on. Would you?

1202
01:55:18,182 --> 01:55:22,809
That for you, and your disloyalty
and your treachery.

1203
01:55:24,188 --> 01:55:26,228
Dear heart.

1204
01:55:31,446 --> 01:55:33,485
(mumbles)

1205
01:55:40,788 --> 01:55:44,122
Grandma... Grandma.

1206
01:55:48,004 --> 01:55:51,289
Say good night to Granny.

1207
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:54,176
I'll play you a tune.

1208
01:56:01,643 --> 01:56:03,682
(horse urinates)

1209
01:56:11,319 --> 01:56:14,937
Well, that's a fine thing.

1210
01:56:15,073 --> 01:56:19,569
You've pissed right in the middle
of my love song.

1211
01:56:19,702 --> 01:56:20,698
(laughs)

1212
01:56:20,828 --> 01:56:23,450
God! Pissin' over my song.

1213
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:44,139
Well...

1214
01:57:11,003 --> 01:57:13,839
(gasps)

1215
01:57:13,965 --> 01:57:16,835
(Logan) You know what woke you up?

1216
01:57:18,928 --> 01:57:22,095
Lee, you just had your throat cut.

1217
01:57:53,087 --> 01:57:55,625
(footsteps)

1218
01:58:01,137 --> 01:58:03,426
Where is he?

1219
01:58:21,866 --> 01:58:24,737
He's in there.

1220
01:58:37,965 --> 01:58:42,010
All the rest of the hands left
a couple of days ago except for Vern.

1221
01:58:42,136 --> 01:58:46,383
- I'm stayin'. You betcha.
- It's all right, Vern.

1222
01:58:49,811 --> 01:58:56,145
I told him I was leaving last night
and he... sort of came unravelled.

1223
01:58:56,275 --> 01:58:59,442
He's just lost himself.

1224
01:59:01,447 --> 01:59:04,484
Well, all I can say is
he'd better leave the room,

1225
01:59:04,617 --> 01:59:07,534
cos I'm gonna do it regardless.

1226
01:59:07,662 --> 01:59:10,947
Get out of the way, Vern.
You recognise this?

1227
01:59:12,667 --> 01:59:16,415
- You recognise it?
- (Vern) No. No.

1228
01:59:16,546 --> 01:59:19,084
Please, don't shoot him.

1229
01:59:19,215 --> 01:59:22,132
What are you caterwauling about, Vern?

1230
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:24,466
Get out of the way
before I put one into you.

1231
01:59:24,595 --> 01:59:27,762
You might as well. He's all I got. No...

1232
01:59:28,933 --> 01:59:32,017
He's all I have. He's all I have.

1233
01:59:32,144 --> 01:59:34,932
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Shoot me.

1234
01:59:36,566 --> 01:59:39,021
(Vern) Shoot me. Yes, shoot me.

1235
01:59:41,237 --> 01:59:44,321
- Praise the Lord.
- Get out! Get that son of a bitch away.

1236
01:59:44,448 --> 01:59:48,577
- Vern, will you get away?
- I will. You betcha.

1237
01:59:50,997 --> 01:59:53,238
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- What for?

1238
01:59:54,292 --> 01:59:56,961
For everything.

1239
01:59:59,797 --> 02:00:02,039
Your friends, are they...

1240
02:00:04,927 --> 02:00:06,967
Yeah.

1241
02:00:13,769 --> 02:00:15,809
If...

1242
02:00:19,275 --> 02:00:22,276
What were you gonna do? Just take off?

1243
02:00:22,403 --> 02:00:23,566
Yes.

1244
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:29,325
What'd you expect?

1245
02:00:29,452 --> 02:00:31,575
To see you, for one thing.

1246
02:00:36,167 --> 02:00:39,203
- Did you think I'd be above ground?
- Well, of course.

1247
02:00:39,337 --> 02:00:43,880
- Why "of course"?
- Because I just can't imagine you dead.

1248
02:00:44,926 --> 02:00:48,129
My God, are you gonna make me say it?

1249
02:00:51,432 --> 02:00:52,547
Tom!

1250
02:01:07,657 --> 02:01:10,361
(Vern moaning)

1251
02:01:43,025 --> 02:01:45,481
(buggy approaches)

1252
02:01:57,707 --> 02:02:00,376
You've just about done it, huh?

1253
02:02:01,627 --> 02:02:03,667
Yeah.

1254
02:02:06,048 --> 02:02:09,464
Well, I think I've found
a buyer for the ranch.

1255
02:02:09,593 --> 02:02:15,383
I'm going into Absaroka now
to see about it and find a place for Vern.

1256
02:02:17,101 --> 02:02:18,725
Well...

1257
02:02:19,895 --> 02:02:21,935
I'm glad.

1258
02:02:23,899 --> 02:02:28,941
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
tryin' to get back at somebody.

1259
02:02:30,072 --> 02:02:32,112
Why'd you say that?

1260
02:02:33,784 --> 02:02:36,454
No reason.

1261
02:02:42,209 --> 02:02:44,831
Well, hell, neither do I.

1262
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:56,465
Where do you think you'll be...
in about six months?

1263
02:02:58,517 --> 02:03:03,428
Well, if I was to guess,
I'd say north of the breaks.

1264
02:03:04,356 --> 02:03:06,563
There's the Little Rockies up there.

1265
02:03:06,692 --> 02:03:11,935
A lot of little valleys are supposed
to have water year round.

1266
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:17,112
Sounds like a real good guess.
