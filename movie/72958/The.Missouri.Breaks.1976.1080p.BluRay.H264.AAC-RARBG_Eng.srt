1
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,793
First time I saw this country,

2
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,338
it had buffalo grass and blue-joint
up to the stirrups.

3
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,467
By the second year
we had 8,000 Texas half-bred cattle,

4
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,931
and over 3,500 volumes
of English literature in my library.

5
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,227
Hell, we just cut out the unbranded stock

6
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,480
and divided them up even handed
between the outfits.

7
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,609
There was no arguing over mavericks
like today.

8
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,737
You've got it good today.

9
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,031
Two percent annual loss then.

10
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,076
Now it's seven percent from rustling alone,
not to mention winter kill,

11
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,913
calving loss, miring down in the spring.

12
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,547
How many are you?

13
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,763
Mr. Braxton, did you notice how these guys
sew their old boot tops on the saddle

14
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,473
to hold ammunition?

15
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,809
Pete, don't pester him
if he doesn't want to be pestered.

16
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,688
Well, it'd just be awful nice
to know the whole story.

17
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,401
Well, it's beautiful country.

18
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,322
Yes, sir. It sure is.

19
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,285
You especially feel that now?

20
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,832
Yeah.

21
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,936
I sure hope them sporting ladies
don't get sunburned.

22
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,440
I like them white as a pastry.

23
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,234
Ladies.

24
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,916
Are you all set here?

25
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,085
All set, Pete.

26
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,436
Shall we start the horse or will you?

27
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,731
I will, sir.

28
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,267
- Goodbye, Tom.
- Well, that's one of them.

29
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,898
His name was Sandy Chase

30
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,110
and he came here from Rhode Island
with the Army.

31
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,986
He was 24 years old.

32
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,866
We lost Seven percent of our stock

33
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,703
between spring roundup and shipment
in the fall last year to rustlers.

34
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,289
You always mention the percentage.

35
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,417
I wonder why you do that.

36
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,670
This is my fourth frontier
and I know how they run.

37
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,673
I was in the California gold fields
before I was 18.

38
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,299
I was at the rush at Golden Gulch

39
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,844
and I went with the Grazing Committee
to South America.

40
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,764
These long ropers in the Missouri Breaks
are a mixed bag.

41
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,475
Barbers from Minneapolis,

42
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,437
failed grangers, Scandinavian half-breeds,

43
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,649
wolfers and woodcutters,
dishonest apprentices,

44
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,444
raftsmen, poisoners.

45
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,864
You give them a chance
and they'll waste everything.

46
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:39,708
You're astonished at my arrogance.
At not even having a trial, aren't you?

47
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,712
Then why don't you get over it?

48
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,965
Our situation has become
nearly as bad as it could be.

49
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:53,013
Honey, pull down Tristam Shandy
again for me, would you?

50
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,779
Daddy.

51
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,578
Excuse me.

52
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,836
Get that gate.

53
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,300
Come on.

54
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,770
How did she go, Tom?

55
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,108
Everybody else been back a day.

56
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,570
Brought in about 14 head
of the first-class order.

57
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,947
Yeah.

58
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,415
- How was Wyoming?
- It was fine.

59
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,626
Spent a couple of days in K.C.

60
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,754
trying to keep from associating
with criminals.

61
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,884
Why, they hit the Union Pacific
down there so many times

62
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,430
the place has begun to look like
a lawmen's convention.

63
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,141
They got two Pinkertons in K.C.

64
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:05,353
and I do believe that one of them
was the legendary Charlie Siringo.

65
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,691
Did he claim to be a border cowboy?

66
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,193
I can't remember.

67
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,530
- Said he could talk Mexican.
- Yeah, that's him.

68
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,409
How'd you know it was a detective?

69
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,495
Rancher's wife
wanting to go to bed with him.

70
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,539
He kept giving her a no.

71
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,542
Damned if I can understand that.

72
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,878
Well, I took care of her, Cal.

73
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,589
- You did that, huh?
- You're damn sure.

74
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,508
- Had a good time, too, thank you.
- Did you?

75
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,470
Spent the night in Martinsdale.

76
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,306
Couldn't get no credit at the whorehouse,

77
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,644
so I picked up this chubby little girl
off some sodbuster's outfit.

78
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,229
Yeah. How was she?

79
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,902
About like a Swiss clock.

80
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,488
Same exact movement
over and over again.

81
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,075
Yeah.

82
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,137
- It was Sandy, huh?
- Yeah.

83
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,932
Yeah.

84
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,478
Sandy's gone. He's dead.

85
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,440
David Braxton's foreman,
what's his name, Cary?

86
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,567
Pete Marker.

87
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,821
Pete Marker caught him,
and they hung him.

88
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,241
Damn it!

89
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,453
I knew somebody's bunch
wasn't in that corral.

90
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,625
Little Tod was in town.
Everybody was at the hanging.

91
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,134
- How'd Sandy go out?
- Pretty good.

92
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,927
Pretty good. Yeah.

93
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,432
They hung him up on a cottonwood though,
and he sort of...

94
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,893
He sort of what?

95
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,606
Sort of strangled for a while.

96
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,404
Braxton was there dressed in a suit
looking like God.

97
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,494
God damn!

98
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,290
Boy, I'll tell you,
the first time I met Sandy...

99
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,333
Now, listen to this, now.

100
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,254
First time I met Sandy
he was rustling on his own.

101
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,175
He had a stolen cavalry pony
and he kept this dog.

102
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,510
As soon as he'd kill the steer,

103
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,388
why he'd cut the brand off
and feed it to the dog.

104
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,932
He said before they'd get
enough evidence to convict him,

105
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,144
they'd have to lock that dog up,
and pick through his shit for a week,

106
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,688
before they can find the brand.

107
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,535
My aunt ran a laundry in St. Paul.

108
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,832
Got strangled by a Chinaman
while she was washing her dog.

109
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,502
It's easy to die. Easy.

110
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,215
Well, they sure killed Sandy.

111
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,133
He was the only comedian in this outfit.

112
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,636
- Well, you can't...
- Every outfit ought to have a comedian.

113
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,597
You can't run that many rustled horses
across open ground.

114
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,934
Now, I know I've been saying that
but you can't, is all.

115
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,852
What are we supposed to do, Tom?

116
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,523
Open up a stand and sell stolen horses
over the counter?

117
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,360
No, we gotta get a relay ranch
halfway across,

118
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,029
so as we got somewheres
where we can relay them at.

119
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,906
- That's right.
- Well, that's just...

120
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,492
That's just really fucking great.

121
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,577
Only we ain't got a ranch.

122
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,456
We ain't got no money!
The only horses we got are out there!

123
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,708
We can't move the bastards
across the Breaks

124
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,001
without everybody knowing.

125
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,004
Let's just stick up the N.P. Railroad
and buy a ranch.

126
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,048
Hell, let's rob a bank.

127
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,592
I mean, if we're gonna get hung
for rustling horses,

128
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,052
we ought to be robbing trains.

129
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,264
Why don't you boys just move on down
with that hole-in-the-wall bunch

130
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,933
and you'll be around people
that think like that.

131
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,068
Boy, a couple of years ago
they'd have put Sandy

132
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,363
in Red Lodge Penitentiary weaving bridles.

133
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,369
Seem like there's something new in the air.

134
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:41,296
I'll bet you Marker'll bait crows with Sandy
for a week before he'll cut him down.

135
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:45,341
I worked for that son of a bitch once
on the reservation roundup.

136
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,052
And he will leave Sandy in the trees.

137
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,975
Hell, when we was fighting in Kansas,
we had relays all over the damn place.

138
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,103
We relayed a cousin of mine

139
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,399
all the way from Medicine Tree
to the hot springs in New Mexico.

140
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,359
He beat the telegraph.

141
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,320
It took the detectives two years

142
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,031
to cover the same ground
he covered in a week.

143
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,534
And when they got there
he was in his grave up on the Chama.

144
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,872
Why was you having to move
this cousin around so much?

145
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,125
He did card tricks.

146
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,753
I get it.

147
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,800
So he done a card trick for this nigger
up on the Chama

148
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,552
and the nigger throttled him.

149
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,055
I see.

150
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,392
Say, Cal?

151
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,314
Why don't we put that relay
in Braxton's backyard?

152
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah.

153
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,866
It sure beats sending three or four horses
at a time out into Kansas.

154
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,452
The law there is pretty effective now.

155
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,543
I get a kick out of Little Tod.
He says we ought to rob a train.

156
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,259
No...

157
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,721
I'm tired, Cal.

158
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,852
I'm gonna turn in.
Tomorrow we have a nice day.

159
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,695
Too bad about Sandy.

160
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,654
All right, move over there! Move, move!

161
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,324
All right, I want you to uncouple that car.

162
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,367
- Hurry up!
- I can't do it.

163
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,828
I'm not sure I'm able to do it.

164
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,081
Just get down there and pull the pin out!
Go on!

165
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,917
- I'm a clerk, I'm not mechanically inclined.
- Hurry up!

166
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,406
Okay, get the money out.

167
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,034
- What's your name?
- Nelson.

168
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,369
Nelson, you're doing all right.

169
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:46,207
You do this right, you can say you seen
Jesse James and lived to tell the story.

170
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,417
You're not Jesse James.

171
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,214
You ain't Charlie Siringo.
Just give me the money, Nelson.

172
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,093
- I'm not permitted to touch this.
- Give me the God damn money.

173
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,740
Don't start blaming me.

174
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,576
I am blaming you!

175
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,370
This is it on trains! This is it!

176
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,038
God Almighty!

177
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,623
This is it!

178
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,250
No more trains, Tod!

179
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,043
I just don't wanna get blamed!

180
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,886
We got it!

181
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,681
You need some help?

182
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,267
Just pick up the money, God damn it.

183
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,276
But they're all ones! Tom, they're all ones!

184
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,946
Where am I gonna put them all?

185
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,657
I don't want to hear that now, just...

186
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,953
God, isn't this just terrible?

187
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,540
Yeah, and the next time you mention trains
it's gonna get worse!

188
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,546
You boys new at this?

189
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,969
Appreciate your concern, Nelson.

190
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,690
Look, there's tens in the water.
Get in there, Tod.

191
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,901
Get in the water! Get those tens!

192
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,286
One more time.

193
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,251
Get out of my way!

194
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,966
Come on now, let's get out of here
with what we've got.

195
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,990
Morning, my little darling.

196
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,618
Easy, Si, or you'll see them in church.

197
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,584
I think all of you working men and women

198
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,921
have had time now
to consider this case before us.

199
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,131
There's Braxton.

200
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,174
And I have reviewed its details

201
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,928
and now I feel secure enough
to pronounce sentence.

202
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,557
Subject, of course,
to your scrutiny and support.

203
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,018
Make him confess first.
We wanna hear him confess.

204
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,313
I think the kindest thing we can do
to this bird

205
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,399
is to send him up to the territorial prison.

206
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,777
He's been about as cooperative
as any prisoner we've tried around here.

207
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,195
Cecil's always cooperative.

208
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,614
And I see no direct cause to hang him.

209
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,575
Don't he look like God?

210
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,245
Now, who's got an opinion about how
long you might think of sending him up?

211
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,457
- I think it's clearly indicated.
- He'll take anything.

212
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,044
- How would 10 to 20 sound to you?
- Sounds about right to me.

213
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,381
- How soon would I be eligible for parole?
- In about two weeks.

214
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,758
Two weeks!

215
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,429
Anything further
you'd like to say to the Court

216
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,598
before we send you to your just deserts?

217
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,433
And if I may speak for the Court,

218
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,062
we would prefer
that it be something colorful.

219
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,564
Life on the frontier being what it is.

220
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,484
Just that...

221
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,572
It may seem to you boys

222
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,158
like a hard way to make the papers.

223
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,078
But I'm not ashamed of robbing that train,

224
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,041
of blowing bridges, sticking up banks,

225
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,461
or for my careless, devil-may-care gunplay.

226
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,300
I'm not ashamed of pissing away
the money on hard living either

227
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,135
because I'm that kind of guy.

228
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,973
But as a concession to me
for my cooperation,

229
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:16,310
I would like you all to refer to me
from now on

230
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,729
as The Lonesome Kid.

231
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:24,610
Especially in front of outsiders
here in the West.

232
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,946
That's enough of that!

233
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,533
Let's all go up to the bar
and make fools of ourselves.

234
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,556
I haven't danced liked that since Chicago.

235
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,392
I'm Tom Logan.

236
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:00,688
I'd like to congratulate you, sir
on your treatment of that imposter.

237
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,527
- My daughter, Jane.
- Hello.

238
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,364
People have told me that
I should talk to you, Mr. Braxton.

239
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,993
I just sold a family implement business
up in the Shonkin Range

240
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,454
and I'm thinking of buying a small ranch.

241
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,877
You done so well,
I'd like a piece out by you for good luck.

242
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,967
Well, the Cannon Ranch is for sale.

243
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,554
Isn't much, four sections and a cabin.

244
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,514
Pole corrals around it.

245
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,726
But it's well watered
and pretty fair shelter.

246
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,854
The owner's living in town now,

247
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,232
has a cooperage down at the end of Main,
past the livery.

248
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,196
I understand
you had some rustling problems.

249
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,948
Seven percent losses per annum.

250
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,746
You should know about that.
First year, that might just break you.

251
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,253
I understand
you had to hang someone here.

252
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,381
I did that.

253
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,468
That's tough.

254
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,181
What was this, some kind of a desperado?

255
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,601
No. He was a thief.

256
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,438
With probably a million good reasons
for being on hard times.

257
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,274
The main thing is that
we put him out of his misery.

258
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,949
Don't you believe in hanging thieves, miss?

259
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,117
No, sir, I don't, do you?

260
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,953
Well, I surely do.

261
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,456
How in the world else
are we gonna have law and order?

262
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,793
Well, what do you know?

263
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,756
Maybe you can buy that Cannon Ranch,
get yourself started in the cattle business.

264
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,467
'Cause with an attitude toward
human life like you have,

265
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,637
you may yet get to be
one of the barons of this prairie

266
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,973
and have your picture up on page one,

267
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,350
or page three anyway,
of the Chicago papers.

268
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:06,480
And for your birthday you can have
a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice,

269
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,817
just the way the other hangmen
up this way do.

270
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,820
You sound bitter, lady.

271
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,115
You should've seen that young man's face.

272
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,160
- He did not die quickly.
- I don't want to hear about it, miss.

273
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,163
I don't think that you can
really picture the man's face.

274
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,499
I don't want to hear about it, miss.

275
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,254
Thank you for your information,
Mr. Braxton.

276
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:35,009
I'll go over at the cooperage and ask
Mr. Cannon about them four sections.

277
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,429
Pleasure to meet you too, miss.

278
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,406
It's up to Tom now.

279
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,992
Damn, I feel better now.

280
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,871
- Damned if I don't.
- Me, too.

281
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,337
I see him. Hold it.

282
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,883
- Oh, God! You didn't cut him down, yet.
- We did!

283
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,225
- Oh, God!
- Oh, Pete.

284
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,228
Oh, my God, they've killed my man.

285
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,072
Where the hell you clodhoppers been at?

286
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,240
- File that.
- What is it?

287
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,950
Get the guns. Let's go for a ride.

288
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,369
I wanna go to a whorehouse.

289
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,329
I wanna play some cards.
I wanna get drunk.

290
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,623
We can go to the whorehouse
and do all that later.

291
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,209
What's the matter with you?
Ain't you got no pride of ownership?

292
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,460
I buy you a brand new ranch,

293
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,462
don't you even wanna ride out
and look at it?

294
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,589
- Hell, we own it. We can go anytime.
- Yeah?

295
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,715
Let's go for a drink.

296
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,509
Let's play some cards
and get some woman.

297
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,968
Let's go to the whorehouse.

298
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,596
Well, you're gonna have to
pick and choose on that

299
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,598
because the money's about all gone.

300
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,266
Hell, the money can't be gone.

301
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,686
- Well, it is and I'm glad.
- And I'm glad, too.

302
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,271
- Why?
- Because robbing trains...

303
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,693
We start a pattern of robbing trains
and we're gonna get detectives.

304
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,780
From that moment on, you can just back
the calendar down till they hang us.

305
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,198
That's why.

306
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,415
I still think we should rob a bank.

307
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,916
Rob trains, rob a bank.

308
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,129
- All right, let's go to the whorehouse.
- Yeah.

309
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,265
You here for a party?

310
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,562
- That's right.
- What kind of a party?

311
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,946
Well...

312
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,199
You got any girls?

313
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,713
Go on, Si.

314
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,142
The girls here can show you
to the party rooms.

315
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,481
- I like them ribbons.
- No, shit.

316
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,525
Anybody want anything to eat?

317
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,571
Well, he's the one that I want.

318
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,282
You just come right on upstairs with me.

319
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,536
- Come on now.
- Where's the chubby one?

320
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,039
Take it easy, will you? Give me a kiss.

321
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,457
Oh, yeah.

322
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,337
Ain't that a match up?

323
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,131
Just like you and your horse, Little Tod.

324
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,855
Well, that one got away.

325
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,357
You'll pay for that.

326
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,568
In my hometown
I'm considered a dangerous person.

327
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,988
Yeah? In your home town
a man can get a bad reputation

328
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,949
for smoking corn silk.

329
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,284
Coil under a rock.

330
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,579
Well, Cary'll stay up at the Breaks,
but somebody's gotta tend this place.

331
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,375
Well, I can tell you one damn thing,
it isn't gonna be me.

332
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,342
I got you! I'm gonna get you, son of a bitch!

333
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,762
Here, how about this, guys?

334
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,234
I like this place, Cal.

335
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,572
Yeah, I like it quiet.

336
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:13,412
Cary, don't throw them tools
down there like that, please.

337
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,585
I spent my first 18 years
on one of these God damn things

338
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,129
working for my uncle that raised me.

339
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,715
And I worked myself cross-eyed, too.

340
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,970
About the only thing I had for distraction
was this dog.

341
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,683
And I'd had the dog
since I was 10 years old.

342
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,645
And he shot it

343
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,150
for sticking it's tongue on a pat of butter.

344
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,070
So I stayed one more night,

345
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,824
then I killed his seed bull.

346
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,702
I rustled every damned horse he had,

347
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:57,539
including a racer that I sold
as a cow pony to an Indian rancher.

348
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,000
And I took the whole damn remuda.

349
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,503
And I come within a hair's breadth
of sending his sorry hide to kingdom come.

350
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,591
I mean, I was that close to shooting
that son of a bitch in the brainpan.

351
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,515
Well, I never did have
that kind of background.

352
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,185
Never had nothing, neither.

353
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,228
My folks always wanted a place.

354
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,857
They was good people so I always
sort of saw it with their eyes, you know.

355
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,525
Yeah, I see that.

356
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,070
But when you think about it,

357
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,490
you wouldn't want the weight
of a damn place like this.

358
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,080
Do you do alterations, too, ma'am?

359
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,542
Nope.

360
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:49,716
And I don't do your
wire ripped shirts, neither.

361
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,431
There you go.

362
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,977
Si, you're beginning to sound
like a real old lady.

363
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,522
What do you say we just jump
this piss-ass seamstress?

364
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:07,234
You guys are soon gonna learn
to treat me nice.

365
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,489
Come on, I'll kill you!

366
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,993
And everybody's so scared of
the damn Mounties that nobody even tries.

367
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,911
These horses ain't even half guarded.

368
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,247
Are you gonna talk to me
about Canada again?

369
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,416
You're God damn right I am.

370
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,836
Them Mounties scares me, Cal.

371
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,754
Why, hell, they scare everybody.

372
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,548
That's why it's gonna be so easy.

373
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,758
The Indians won't even touch them horses.

374
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,761
We can take all 60 of them ponies at a walk.

375
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,100
All Canadian government brand?

376
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,353
Until we can get them down
to the Breaks for modification

377
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,564
and then down here to relay.

378
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,901
Well, that doesn't quite settle it,
though, does it?

379
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,778
No, it don't.

380
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,533
Somebody's gonna have to stay here.

381
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,244
Well, it isn't gonna be me.

382
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,914
Well, it's gotta be one of the two of us.

383
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,541
And I'll tell you one God damn thing...

384
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,336
You had all the fun on that train
while I had to baby-sit these savages.

385
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:12,007
And I'm going to Canada for sure.
That's settled. Now, that's it.

386
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:34,029
I gotta stay on this
God damn piece of ground.

387
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:37,032
God damn! I can't even believe this.

388
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,953
Shit, that's pitiful.

389
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,539
You assholes will just get lost.

390
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,667
He was the best foreman
in the entire territory.

391
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,836
He's the only foreman I ever had.

392
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,881
- Pete Marker was a hard man.
- Amen.

393
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,591
Surely he was, David.

394
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,928
He could break out a good stride horse
better than the bronc fighters.

395
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,679
He could do every job he asked you to do.

396
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,640
He was a great ramrod.

397
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,682
Yes, he was.

398
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,270
He personified the American West
in the days of its rowdy youth.

399
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,730
Sure did.

400
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,107
Excuse me.

401
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,951
Lee Clayton.

402
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,496
Oh, my God, you gave me a scare.
All I could see was your horse.

403
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,166
Well, that was all you were meant to see.

404
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,501
Is the owner about?

405
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,881
Who may I say is calling?

406
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,757
Lee Clayton.

407
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,801
I just said that.

408
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,929
I have a short memory.

409
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,394
Well, I'll tell Daddy that you're here

410
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,355
and then I can get back to what I was doing
before the horse trick.

411
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,109
Tell him Lee Clayton,
from Medicine Hat, Wyoming,

412
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,028
here on business.

413
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,447
- You got it?
- Yes.

414
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,511
- Come in. I've been expecting you.
- Sir.

415
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,350
I don't know why
it would not have tired me more than it did

416
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,187
to have traveled all this distance
without more than a cat nap.

417
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,609
You know, you've a wonderful
set of books here, sir.

418
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,903
- Yes, I have.
- Truly, truly beautiful.

419
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,322
I don't spend the time with them I should.

420
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,241
Well, I'm of the opinion,

421
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,202
I would only claim books

422
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,621
that was about right from wrong.

423
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:33,625
Otherwise, how are we to find
our paradise among the stars?

424
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,336
True. Please.

425
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,383
Sir, I'm sorry for your trouble.

426
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,926
I wasn't aware.

427
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,513
Gentlemen, Robert E. Lee Clayton.

428
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,853
I understand that you hung a thief

429
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,274
and that you neglected to find out
where they were caching the stock.

430
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,858
How was that?

431
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,611
He didn't want to talk
and he was about to die.

432
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,197
I see.

433
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,157
- Well, then you pampered him.
- No!

434
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,201
- That's an outrage.
- We hung that man.

435
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,037
- We hung that man.
- You pampered the man!

436
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,915
You pampered the man
and the result of that

437
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,668
is the loss of this poor man's life!

438
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,380
But please, this is outrageous.

439
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,467
Please take your hands off!

440
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,845
And realize the fact

441
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,308
that as a result of that
this poor man has lost his life!

442
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,685
And if you'd invited me
into the neighborhood before,

443
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,061
it wouldn't have happened.

444
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,730
What kind of a man is he?

445
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,733
You've got to give me some thoughts.

446
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,403
I'm gonna turn my horse out.

447
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,905
Then I'll wash my body.

448
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,867
And miss,

449
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,953
the only thing not on my diet

450
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,498
would be the green top of the beet

451
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,250
and okra.

452
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,544
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me,

453
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,130
but I'm under a severe attack from a tooth.

454
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,424
Sir.

455
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,343
Miss.

456
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,602
- Where'd he come from?
- What was all that about?

457
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,063
I got unequivocal recommendations
for this man

458
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,440
from all the Wyoming outfits
he's worked for.

459
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,902
- I've been assured that he's a top regulator.
- That clunk, regulator?

460
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,862
You mean to say you asked him up here?

461
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,655
You're damn right I did.

462
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,743
They killed my ramrod
and I want them to pay for it.

463
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,329
You know, I always did wonder
what Lee Clayton looked like.

464
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,872
And smelled like.

465
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,667
I always figured he would be a little fellow.

466
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,463
He's supposed to have a Creedmoor rifle
he carries as a saddle gun.

467
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,965
Supposed to be able to hit out to 500 yards.

468
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,300
Mr. Rate!

469
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,053
He never carries a sidearm,

470
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,222
so you know the son of a gun
is a dry gulcher.

471
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,140
He smells like a wet tub.

472
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,145
He don't have no life
but he sure does keeps himself spruced up.

473
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,814
Many a rustler's said his prayers

474
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,609
when he got a whiff of them
lavender bath salts and sagebrush.

475
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,244
- Daddy, I wanna know how you...
- Not now, dear.

476
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:19,165
- Vern, scat, out of here, go.
- I will. You betcha, I will.

477
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,458
Adios, buddies.

478
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,877
Send you a postal card from Canada.

479
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,339
Cal, why can't I go to Canada?

480
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,300
'Cause you gotta tend to the cabin
in the Breaks, Cary.

481
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,386
You don't hear Tom complaining, do you?

482
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,638
See you in a few weeks, Tom!

483
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,440
They'll be back, Buck.
Don't you worry about it.

484
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,163
Well, by gosh! Good morning to you, miss.

485
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,498
Good morning to you, Mr. Logan.

486
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,626
- You bought this place already, huh?
- Yes, ma'am.

487
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,881
Well, I guess that kind of makes us
neighbors then, doesn't it?

488
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,384
Where are you headed?

489
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,053
I'm gonna go over on the table.

490
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,390
- Well, may I accompany you?
- No.

491
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,684
Why not?

492
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,854
No good reason.
I just don't want any company.

493
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,231
Well, come on, give me a chance.

494
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,902
Give you a chance?
Give you a chance for what?

495
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,322
You know, miss,
I'm gonna take this opportunity

496
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,574
to be just a little damn bit offended.

497
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:40,079
'Cause if there's anybody in this district
got a right to think of theyselves

498
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:45,251
as wholesome companionship,
why, it's yours truly.

499
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,133
Well, if you're such
a wholesome companion

500
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,594
what were you doing at the whorehouse?

501
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,430
Who in the world told you that?

502
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,642
Mary O'Connell,
that little blonde you paid for.

503
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,311
Well, I hope that's all she told you.

504
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,562
She told me everything.

505
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,942
We're kind of starved for news out here.
All I ever hear about is grass.

506
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,777
What's the matter with grass?

507
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,405
Samuel Johnson said,
"A blade of grass is a blade of grass,

508
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,033
"now tell me something about
a human being."

509
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,370
- I don't understand that at all.
- It just means

510
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,623
that Samuel Johnson was as bored
as I am with nature.

511
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,876
We had a famous painter out here last year,
natural scenes.

512
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,212
That man must have painted
10 square miles of canvas,

513
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,880
not one human face.

514
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,633
And I wish he could have been here
to paint that boy, Sandy,

515
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,469
hanging up so decoratively
against the mountains.

516
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,680
Because his pink tongue, and his white face

517
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,683
would have just set off
the green of Montana splendidly.

518
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:45,436
I mean, it would have made
the damndest bank calendar you ever saw.

519
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,357
Well, you succeeded.

520
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,068
This was where I was coming to
and you're still with me.

521
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,487
The persistence of the young rancher.

522
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,991
Well, I know what I want, is all.

523
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,409
What do you want?

524
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,453
I mean, I know what it is
when I want something.

525
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,622
Come on.

526
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,499
Come on what?

527
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,835
Why don't you just say what you mean?

528
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,212
This is what I mean.

529
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,839
Do you want me?

530
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,508
What does that mean?

531
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,969
I mean that you're following me around
on your damn horse.

532
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,887
- What have you got in mind?
- Me?

533
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,681
Sexual intercourse?

534
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,019
- Oh, my.
- Well, all right.

535
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,854
All right.

536
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,607
Come on. Get down off your horse.

537
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,485
Now, I'm not gonna have
any hesitation from you.

538
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,530
Not from a frequenter of whores.
Now, get down from your horse.

539
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,490
All right, just back off.

540
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,993
I'm gonna step down with my own speed.

541
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,039
All right.

542
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,169
I'm going to lose it right here.

543
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,713
In all these blades of grass.

544
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,591
Do I have to come to you?

545
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,384
- All right.
- Hold it.

546
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,221
- What?
- Who asked you to do all this?

547
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,892
- Well, your entire behavior is...
- Never mind that.

548
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,978
I didn't ask you.
You said that you wanted it.

549
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,230
- Well, do you?
- No.

550
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,650
- Well, then, you're not gonna get it.
- Good.

551
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,152
Keep the dang thing, I don't want it.

552
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,571
I forgot.
You do have your whores, don't you?

553
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,782
Sure do. Like them, too.

554
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,076
Well, I'll tell you something,

555
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,161
- if you want them more...
- I keep telling you,

556
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,081
I want them a lot. I don't want you at all.

557
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,500
Well, why are you being so mean to me?

558
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,587
People have been neglecting to tell you
what a nasty little bitch you are

559
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,382
and I'm just having to make up
for their negligence.

560
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,635
I just seem mean. I'm only being thorough.

561
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,142
Well, if you're gonna start that,

562
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:52,021
I'm just gonna go home
and shovel steer manure on the pansies.

563
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:57,568
Well, you just wait a minute
because I'm gonna stop.

564
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,574
You gonna talk nice?

565
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,119
I will do my best,

566
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,663
you bastard.

567
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,459
- Can I have a kiss?
- No, I hardly know you.

568
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,005
Why don't we just take walk
and we'll just talk about the Wild West

569
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,508
and how to get the hell out of it.

570
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:26,264
Well, all right. I can talk about that.

571
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,351
Cal, you know,
I forgot how to tie a diamond hitch.

572
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,271
A squaw hitch. That's all you need
for a load that light, anyway.

573
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,815
- You'll be gone for a couple of weeks.
- Give or take a few days.

574
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,151
Start to move some of this stock down
to make way.

575
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,194
- No more than two or three...
- Three at a time.

576
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,988
Hell, I been doing this for a while,
you know.

577
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,157
Yeah, I reckon you have. Let's go.

578
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,162
Keep low, boy.

579
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,335
Hell of a damn way to ride off.

580
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,428
Stay with your horse.

581
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,015
Stay with your horse, Si!

582
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,189
Si, let go of the ropes.

583
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,815
Help!

584
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,569
He's gonna drown!

585
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,529
Help! Give me a hand!

586
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:32,121
We did it.
We crossed that son of a bitch, didn't we?

587
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,541
- I couldn't swim, but...
- Yeah, I know.

588
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,835
But I was swimming, right?

589
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,922
I can, I did it!

590
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,799
We deserve a lot of damn credit.

591
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:47,553
I mean, we crossed the Mighty Mo
and I want some damn credit!

592
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:52,350
Most of them catfish in that
son of a bitch could eat a pig!

593
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,935
Or a chicken.

594
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,564
Get up.

595
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,109
- Easy now.
- Tom.

596
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,747
You're the only rancher around here
who hasn't met the new regulator.

597
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,416
Tom Logan, Robert E. Lee Clayton.

598
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,711
It's a pleasure
to make it your acquaintance, sir.

599
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,924
Damn near sucked my boot off.

600
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,679
Pleasure to meet you, Regulator.

601
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,723
Ain't that like a dry gulcher?

602
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,018
That's not the softest term
you could use, I'd say.

603
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,022
Well, Regulator,
correct me now if I'm wrong.

604
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,025
Isn't a regulator one of these boys

605
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,654
that shoots people
and don't never get near them?

606
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,072
That's it.

607
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,951
Well...

608
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,872
What about the binoculars?
What are they for?

609
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,834
Well, I've taken to watching
funny-looking birds.

610
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,670
I see.

611
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,548
Well, hell, I don't know.

612
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:10,136
I suppose if you didn't get away
off a mile or so to do the job,

613
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,555
you'd just get messy like I done here.

614
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,849
Easy, Tom. Don't let me down.

615
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:19,812
I've just had to hear this from all the other
dreamers trying to ranch around here.

616
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,232
Lee, did you ever hit a man from a mile off

617
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,444
while he was carrying a pail of water?

618
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,487
A mile, well...

619
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,866
But I don't remember the pail.

620
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,410
No, sir.

621
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:40,374
When you hang a man, you usually...
He has a chance to talk

622
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,045
or say goodbye, write a letter.

623
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,672
Besides, a Creedmoor.

624
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,551
That's a Creedmoor, isn't it?

625
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,554
It is a Creedmoor, sir, and a beautiful one.

626
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,390
Must make a pretty good mess of a human.

627
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,769
When you hit a guy from 500 yards out,

628
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,354
say, why, the suddenness of it,

629
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,358
he don't even have a few seconds
to make his Act of Contrition.

630
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,444
Not only that,
but you never have to look him in the eye.

631
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,863
Right there, that makes all the difference.

632
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,698
I would disagree with you, sir.

633
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,493
The thing that makes all the difference
in the world, I believe,

634
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,621
is the fact that it accomplishes
the task, you see.

635
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,833
This old boy in Wyoming...

636
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,547
This old boy in Wyoming,
he sat down on the ground,

637
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,883
just to pull sandburs out of his trousers

638
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,219
and his skull just suddenly flew into pieces

639
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,429
about the size of your thumbnail.

640
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:39,934
That was the first time
I ever heard the term "regulator."

641
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,520
That was the first time?

642
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,938
First time.

643
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,568
What would be your line of work, sir?

644
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,155
I used to be in the implement business
up in the Shonkin Sag,

645
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,242
but I started back in to ranch south of here.

646
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,246
When you started back in, it was before?

647
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:05,710
My family used to have a place
but when they lost it I hired out.

648
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,712
I see.

649
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:11,090
Well, I certainly wish you
good fortune, Mr. Logan.

650
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,720
You know, the times are hard.
I'm a small operator.

651
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,976
And I hope the damn horse thieves
leaves you something.

652
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,644
I hope so, too.

653
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,272
- Good day to you, sir.
- Bye-bye, now.

654
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:31,736
I think this colt of yours will be all right
if you can find a wet mare.

655
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,779
- Is the mother dead?
- Yeah.

656
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,616
She got bogged down in a mire
about a mile from here.

657
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,411
See you later, Tom. Thanks.

658
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,748
- All right, Mr. Braxton.
- Damn those hands of mine.

659
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,710
Good luck, Old Sloppy.

660
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,850
Must have smelled something.

661
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,771
Closer you get towards Canada
the more things eat your horses.

662
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,984
Probably smelled a bear or a cat
or some damn thing.

663
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,988
Either one of them just go ahead
and eat your horses up.

664
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,366
Easy.

665
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,536
Damn!

666
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,499
I don't why they had to put Canada
way the hell up here.

667
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,595
Well, hello, Jane.

668
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,139
Hello, Tom.

669
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,519
I didn't think I'd find you here.

670
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,270
Why'd you think that?

671
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,522
'Cause I haven't seen you.

672
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:54,693
You thought I was gonna come courting,
didn't you?

673
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,904
Maybe so.

674
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:02,743
You was too harsh to me last time.
I never kick a dead horse, lady.

675
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,166
That sure is some garden
you've started here.

676
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,335
Have you had one before?

677
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:16,048
No. My aunt had one
and I kind of took it over.

678
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,510
I ain't half bad at it, though.

679
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,929
No.

680
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,852
Why don't you get down off your horse?

681
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,104
I will, thank you.

682
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,570
You're a lot nicer than you was before.
Why is that?

683
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:44,160
Well, you didn't come courting me
like I figured you would and I...

684
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,956
You what?

685
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,459
I'm trying to revive your interest.

686
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,753
Yeah?

687
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,926
Come here a minute,
and I'll show you something.

688
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,100
All right.

689
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,353
Now, lift that up.

690
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,623
Close her down. Garden's watered.

691
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,461
I admire you.

692
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,797
Come on in the house.

693
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,592
I'll make you cup of Chinee tea.

694
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,093
Chinee tea?

695
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,316
Northern Pacific Railroad?
Where did you get these?

696
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,526
Just souvenirs.

697
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,332
How long does the tea take?

698
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,918
Five or ten minutes.

699
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,092
Can I come over there?

700
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,266
I'll come over there if you ask me to.

701
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,400
Let's go over there.

702
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,325
You sure about that?

703
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,664
That's right.

704
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,502
How do you know you're sure about that?

705
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,880
Well, why do you think?

706
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:08,971
'Cause that's the reason why
you come out here in the first place.

707
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,016
That's right.

708
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,106
This here tea's gonna get black as ink.

709
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,113
We'll write somebody a letter with it.

710
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,827
Let's write your father a letter.

711
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:37,166
Tell him that you're the prisoner
of the Chinee Tea Slavers.

712
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,118
Would you like to do this?

713
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,998
Yeah.

714
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,167
I would like to.

715
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,796
That's what I would like to do.

716
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,182
I'm sorry.

717
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,721
God.

718
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,498
God damn. That's pretty.

719
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,084
Yeah. They're neat little bastards,
ain't they?

720
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,131
Boy, there's more of them than I expected.

721
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,927
Yeah. Do you suppose them catfish
ever look up?

722
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,387
- Piss on them.
- From up here?

723
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,273
Supposed to be the best police
in the world.

724
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,443
- They don't scare me.
- Me, neither.

725
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,989
Come on, let's take these horses
to the home of the brave

726
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,200
- and land of the free.
- Not today.

727
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,160
- What do you mean?
- Not today.

728
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,631
I'm gonna have an awful lot of explaining
to do when I get home.

729
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,717
But I'm not going to lie my way
out of this one.

730
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,803
Yes, I am.

731
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,807
- Which one?
- I'm gonna lie my way out of it.

732
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,019
- Where did she go?
- Who?

733
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,646
Your ma.

734
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:34,444
Well, she listened very carefully
to my father for about three years,

735
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,405
weighed every word,

736
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:40,450
and then she up and ran off with the first
unreasonable man that she could find.

737
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,829
Wait a minute. Stop.

738
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,332
Look, this is a nice way to ride,
but I know a much better way.

739
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:52,087
- What? Where you going?
- Just wait.

740
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,349
- Well, that is clever.
- Yeah, isn't it?

741
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,769
Would you say that this is lewd conduct?

742
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,273
Well, I couldn't say for sure.

743
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:16,737
My father has a library full of law books,
'cause he believes in the law.

744
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:20,198
And he says that we haven't
got any law up here, yet.

745
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,785
What brings that to your mind?

746
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,997
Because in one of those law books of his

747
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,458
there's a whole section on lewd conduct.

748
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,960
What about it?

749
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,379
It's against the law.

750
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,846
Are you an outlaw?

751
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:50,437
I'm a jackpot rancher with a milk cow

752
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,482
and a 100 square foot
of root vegetables. Why?

753
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,401
Why do you have so many guns?

754
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,654
Because I'm a sportsman.

755
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,200
Why do you have a sawed-off shotgun?

756
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,120
Well, because, I'm a sawed-off sportsman.

757
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,044
Well, something has sure started
in my thinking,

758
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:18,173
I don't know why we should go on,
if you're just gonna end up dead.

759
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:26,098
Can we get down here for a while?

760
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,770
- Yeah, okay.
- You can make it?

761
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,217
Now, they've locked in with Jesus.
Let's do it.

762
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,512
Makes me feel real safe and peaceful.

763
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,723
Well, that's what Sunday's are for.

764
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:28,572
For the best police in the world
them Mounties are dumber than sticks.

765
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,616
- We just walked them backwards.
- Pipe down. Cut it.

766
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:53,889
Damn.

767
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,726
Shouldn't crawl up on people like that.

768
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:01,354
Well, I'm not the crawling kind.

769
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,149
I was just passing by.

770
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,818
I thought I'd ask you a question or two.

771
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:11,823
There was a family of Logans
out at K.C. Wyoming.

772
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,325
There was four brothers.

773
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,535
The youngest was a kid
by the name of Lonnie.

774
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,662
They was all pretty quick, you know.

775
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:20,624
Except for Lonnie, he was a fiddle player,

776
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,168
and they killed him off right quick.

777
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:27,047
'Cause some of the ranchers
found him thieving or something like that.

778
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:30,300
Anyway, I was wondering,
would they be kin to you?

779
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,345
No.

780
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,848
Well, I didn't think so,
because you don't carry a gun.

781
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,393
No, I never carry a gun.

782
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,397
I never wear a gun, neither.

783
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:49,819
Once in a while
I carry this little darling around.

784
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,863
She's almost like a poem.

785
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,700
You know, it's all hand done.
Etched, you know.

786
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,662
Scratched in silver. She's a beauty.

787
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:02,666
Made for the President of Mexico.
I diverted it for a $100 bill.

788
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,834
But it doesn't shoot worth a damn.

789
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,382
Some damn fool came along and filed off

790
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,885
the top of the front sight there.

791
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,306
And, you have to sort of play with it.

792
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,896
It isn't easy.

793
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:27,482
Have a look at the rope.

794
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,823
Not bad. There's one left.

795
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,042
I doubt it.

796
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,438
You're smart.

797
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,942
Farmers ain't smart.

798
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,987
I don't know just exactly where
you came from

799
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:17,949
or what you were doing,
but I think you ought to go back to it

800
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,076
because you can't farm worth a spit.

801
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,541
Unless...

802
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,002
You lost your nerve.

803
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:33,548
And in that case, cabbages
is just what the doctor ordered.

804
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,475
Is your nerve gone?

805
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,197
Easy, easy.

806
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,080
We're home, boys. We'll bed down soon.

807
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:09,000
How're we gonna get them to swim
across the Mighty Mo?

808
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,961
If we get one or two to go, they'll all go.

809
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,713
Here's the Breaks!

810
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:17,884
Back in the USA. What a relief.

811
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,642
Boys.

812
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,148
- Mounties!
- They can handle weapons.

813
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,191
Come on, move!

814
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,069
Let's get out of here.

815
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,758
I wonder where Little Tod
got himself off to.

816
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,262
I don't know.

817
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,683
I don't know where my finger is, either.

818
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,477
Them Mounties.

819
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:55,523
Followed us right into
the United States of America,

820
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,942
got their horses back.

821
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,112
It's not even legal!

822
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,782
We'll tie that hand up and let's move.

823
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,453
Maybe we'll catch up with Little Tod
at the Snake's Cross.

824
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:38,394
Hey, there.

825
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,779
Do you always get off your horse that way?

826
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,282
I'm not chasing you.

827
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,786
Who in the hell did you think
was after you?

828
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:57,622
This is supposed to be the haunt
of thieves and killers.

829
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:59,957
Shit. Here.

830
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:04,962
This ain't the haunt of nothing
but diamondbacks and old farts like me.

831
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,092
Who are you?

832
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:11,636
Well, my name's Jim Ferguson.

833
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:15,181
I'm pleased to meet you,
what's your name?

834
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,808
Tod La Frambois.

835
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,643
La Frambois?

836
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,981
- What's your trade there, Mr. La Frambois?
- Trade?

837
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:28,027
Well, I've been in
the farm implement business.

838
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:33,157
Now I'm looking to get on with a ranch.
Maybe down around Absaroka.

839
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,869
That'd be over that way.

840
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:47,505
I'll tell you what.
I got a nice hare on a stick over here.

841
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:52,009
Come on, let's go have a bite to eat.

842
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,012
Come on.

843
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:07,567
Life is like

844
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:11,571
A mountain railway

845
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:18,202
With an engineer that's brave

846
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:25,376
We must make this run successful

847
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:32,550
From the cradle to the grave

848
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:36,387
Heed the curves

849
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,724
Build the tunnels

850
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:45,688
Never falter, never quail

851
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,898
Never quail.

852
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:53,237
Keep your hand upon the throttle

853
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:59,577
And your eye upon rail

854
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,499
- Sweet song.
- Yeah.

855
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:11,464
Do you believe that life is like
a mountain railroad, Mr. La Frambois?

856
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:16,427
All I know, Jim, is that

857
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:20,765
life is not like anything I ever seen before.

858
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:31,526
You know, it's really strange running
into a preacher out here in this hellhole.

859
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,738
I believe that life is like a mountain railway.

860
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:40,952
But not for the reasons in the song.

861
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:45,831
I think life is like a mountain railway
'cause you don't have no idea

862
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:49,794
what sleazy son of a bitch
has got his hand on the throttle.

863
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:53,548
That's a real strange attitude
for a preacher.

864
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:02,265
I ain't no preacher.

865
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,648
Well, what do you do?

866
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,942
I'm about a quarter-ass horse thief.

867
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,988
Anything to get some grits in my stomach.

868
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,658
Not doing too good at it, neither.

869
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,995
Otherwise, I wouldn't be eating hare.

870
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,455
I'd be in Dodge City,

871
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:30,751
playing with them big asses,
drinking champagne.

872
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:38,509
What about yourself there, Tod?
What do you do?

873
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,679
Well, there's really nothing to say.

874
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:45,683
I'm a single man. Implement business.

875
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,229
Where you got this implement business?

876
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,023
It's in Big Sandy.

877
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:55,860
No, I mean the Shonkin Sag.
No, I mean Big Sandy.

878
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,737
Yeah, Big...

879
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:00,865
Sandy.

880
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,868
I was raised up in Big Sandy

881
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,830
and there ain't a teeny weeny
implement business in Big Sandy

882
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,708
and not in Shonkin Sag, neither.

883
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,379
Mr. Ferguson,

884
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:19,425
I'm really grateful to you
for your hospitality and everything,

885
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,637
but my line of work
is none of your damn business.

886
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,474
I'm sorry, Tod, I didn't mean
to get you all riled up like that.

887
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,392
I'll tell you what...

888
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,103
Maybe one of these days,

889
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,190
I'll get a chance
to cook your supper for you.

890
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,485
Hooray! A free dang meal.

891
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,114
Good. Thank you, Tod.

892
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:51,749
I hope you'll keep my business
to yourself, too.

893
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,920
- You got my word.
- That's good enough.

894
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:45,720
What the hell's going on here?

895
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,180
God damn.

896
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,725
What the hell's the matter with you?

897
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,268
I don't know, something...

898
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,647
Trying to get some sleep here.

899
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:12,371
Now I want you to cinch up good
on the knot there.

900
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:13,664
Yeah, I did.

901
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,708
All right, now don't have fear.

902
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,043
That's the way my daddy taught me now.

903
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:23,549
Easy aces, now. Come on.

904
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,801
Come on.

905
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:27,928
Put that down.

906
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:31,474
This is the part I hate. I can't swim a lick.

907
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,768
Don't fight it, get it? That's just what I'd do.

908
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,729
Okay, now slide off. Slide off, let her go.

909
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:39,523
Let her go. Let the horse walk on.
Hold on, that's it.

910
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,025
Now we're doing it.

911
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:46,030
I got you now. I'm holding on.
Let's float the boat.

912
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,491
Beautiful!

913
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:51,202
- This was easy.
- Hop on that beast now.

914
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:55,498
Well, we're half way
to the barn now, laddie.

915
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,878
Come on. We cut that son of a bitch.

916
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,717
We cut that god damn thing
slicker than butter.

917
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,428
Now, listen. You go on ahead now.

918
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,557
You go on over there
and I'll secure the rope here.

919
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,309
- You got a good hold on that?
- Yeah.

920
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:17,561
- All right, you just go on now.
- Over there?

921
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,524
Yeah, and then you pull me in case
something happens to me. Understand?

922
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:25,986
Let her go now.

923
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,739
I don't know about this.

924
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:32,910
That's it. Go ahead.

925
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:37,665
- In you go.
- The damn horse won't swim. Come on.

926
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,209
- Dig your heels in now.
- This isn't bad.

927
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,877
Not bad at all.

928
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,422
Bring me in!

929
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:47,716
You dirty tricker, are you gonna talk to me?

930
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,469
You gonna tell me something now?

931
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,597
Listen, son, you got two choices, now.

932
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:56,100
Are you gonna drink
this muddy son of a bitch

933
01:20:56,142 --> 01:21:00,229
or are you gonna tell me about Tom Logan
and your God damn rustlers?

934
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:02,940
I'm gonna give you one!

935
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,278
Mr. La Frambois, one.

936
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:05,085
That's Little Tod's horse.

937
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,046
Damned if it ain't.

938
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:15,471
What happened?
Did he get bucked off or what?

939
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,682
- I don't know.
- Cal?

940
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,688
- What is it?
- What the hell's going on?

941
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:27,358
Just get inside.

942
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,697
- What's happening?
- Lee Clayton.

943
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,039
Come here, Sandy, old girl.
We're going to a picnic.

944
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,800
He never will close that gate, will he?

945
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:56,345
It wasn't near as gloomy around here
when we only had just rustlers.

946
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:59,348
Never seen nothing like that, never.
Come on.

947
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:04,186
I never thought Mr. Braxton
would call in a man like that.

948
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,241
I presume you've had an enlightening trip.

949
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,539
Well, what kind of trip did you have?

950
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,378
What did you learn?

951
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,339
You'll have to lower you voice for that.

952
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:36,427
I feel an attack of gas
and that could be perilous to both of us.

953
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:38,303
That's good.

954
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,435
What did you learn?

955
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:52,234
That the one man that could have
told me something didn't tell me nothing.

956
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:56,697
And then he upped and drowned himself
in the Missouri River.

957
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,993
You've got no further
than we did without you.

958
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,955
I can track a bluebottle fly
right up your nose.

959
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,167
And I've taken to tracking
what people are thinking.

960
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,461
Where's your wife?

961
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,922
What has that got to... Damn it!

962
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,426
I detest your impertinence!

963
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:22,598
You stay out of my private life
you lilac-smelling son of a bitch!

964
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:28,187
Well, you ain't the first mental wizard
I ever met, you know.

965
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:31,899
I met ranchers, outlaws, stock detectives

966
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:35,069
who thought they was mental wizards
like yourself.

967
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:39,490
And there was one thing
I could never understand, and that was...

968
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,326
Why can't they hang onto their women?

969
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:47,581
Well, you're beginning to rave.
And you're beginning to bore me.

970
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:49,333
So you're gonna stop.

971
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,878
You're gonna stop spying on me,
and on my family.

972
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:57,841
You were never hired to do that.
I do not, and Jane does not

973
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:01,845
and the dozen dotes who work for me
do not steal horses!

974
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,974
But somebody does, don't he?

975
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:32,709
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.

976
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,838
- Cal!
- Long time, Logan.

977
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,092
Cal, I want you to meet a good friend
of mine. Jane Braxton.

978
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:41,343
How do?

979
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,762
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, ma'am.

980
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:47,182
She was born and bred here, Cal,
and ready for city lights.

981
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:50,269
Well, pretty ladies
should have what they want.

982
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:52,229
How's the ranch coming, Tom?

983
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,814
Well, you want a tour?

984
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,608
Sure do.

985
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,334
Cal, come on, I'll show you the orchard.
Come on, buddy.

986
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,672
This little bastard was in sorry shape
before I got to it.

987
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:22,759
These trees wouldn't have turned out
a peck of apples apiece.

988
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:25,971
No wonder that guy
was making barrels in town.

989
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:28,223
He sure wasn't running this place right.

990
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:31,310
The tree here was all full of scale
and blight

991
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:34,813
and these limbs I dug out of here
had bores all in them

992
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:37,149
and insect eggs all over everything

993
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:38,901
I mean, it was...

994
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,697
Little Tod didn't come home.

995
01:26:52,415 --> 01:26:54,875
What the hell are you doing?
I mean, just for instance,

996
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,294
what difference does it make
whether scale, blight or bores

997
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,880
eats up this whole God damn ranch?

998
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,802
Well, Cal, I just have to say it.

999
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,308
I'd prefer that they didn't ruin the orchard.

1000
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:25,447
Poor Little Tod.

1001
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,801
Give me that cartridge.

1002
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:53,684
That girl's old man hired Lee Clayton,
didn't he?

1003
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,064
Yeah, he did.

1004
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,943
What about her, where's her husband at?

1005
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:06,697
She don't have a husband,
she don't need one.

1006
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:09,408
Don't need one?

1007
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,120
Boy, you're pretty far gone, ain't you?

1008
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,373
That's the way it happens, isn't it, Cal?

1009
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,000
I wouldn't know.

1010
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:23,463
Not since that dog of mine
put his tongue on the butter.

1011
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:48,530
- Where's Lee Clayton? Is he here?
- You betcha.

1012
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,241
Moved right in. Made himself at home.

1013
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:56,163
Robert Lee?

1014
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:22,773
Robert Lee?

1015
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:31,114
You know, the old man built this tub
for the old lady

1016
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:33,075
and she run out on him.

1017
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,869
Wasn't that you calling me out there?

1018
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,497
Yeah, son, that was me.

1019
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,125
Well, there's no way you can win,
you know.

1020
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,293
What?

1021
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,629
- There's no way you can win.
- Win?

1022
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:49,716
Well, it's kin of mine is all
that's what calls me Robert Lee.

1023
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,676
I'm gonna bust your fat ass.

1024
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:57,682
Well, I hope I can get my nourishment
spending my dinner hour here with you.

1025
01:29:58,017 --> 01:30:02,062
You ain't gonna get no nourishment.
You're gonna dry up and blow away.

1026
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:10,404
But it just ain't in the cards, angel.

1027
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:14,574
I mean, can't you see that the list
is as long as my arm?

1028
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:17,494
And you come under the heading
of what I do for a living.

1029
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:21,206
Now step outside, for as my stomach
has commenced to growl.

1030
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,251
Are you scared?

1031
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:28,505
Shaking all over.

1032
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,259
It's almost like I don't have a prayer.

1033
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,847
But I can't lose this appetite. What ails me?

1034
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,182
You're just floating there
in your confirmation dress,

1035
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,268
waiting for God to save you.

1036
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:45,856
Did it ever bother you sitting up there
in that cabin drinking coffee,

1037
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:49,317
while that fiddler's wife
was screaming in the sand wash?

1038
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:56,032
Well, first off, I don't drink coffee.

1039
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,119
Now can I climb out?
I'm hungry for my supper.

1040
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:02,205
Where's your Creedmoor at, Robert Lee?

1041
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,667
Where's your cabbage-shooting
Mexican pistola,

1042
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:09,296
with flowers on the handle, Robert Lee?
Why don't you go get it?

1043
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:13,133
Well, that settles it.

1044
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,845
I'm not that hungry, and I'll stay here

1045
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:20,557
till someone fetches me
who cares about my welfare

1046
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:21,808
and deplores...

1047
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:24,603
Get up, you dry gulching
piece of floating slime.

1048
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,606
Get up!

1049
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,738
I want to lie here and lose.
No dinner. No nothing.

1050
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:42,245
Well?

1051
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:10,607
My God, you ain't even there!

1052
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,885
Did you kill him?

1053
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:41,596
No, I just emptied his tub.

1054
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:44,808
Somebody's gonna have to do something
about that.

1055
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:06,329
What's become of Tom?

1056
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:10,458
- Isn't he on his place?
- No, he's not.

1057
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:15,672
Well, that's not what I call ranching,
and I know what you're driving at.

1058
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:17,007
All I can tell you, my darling,

1059
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:20,135
is that things have been nearly as bad
as they could be around here.

1060
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:23,263
And if those two men have some reason
to be looking for one another,

1061
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:24,639
it's not my place to interfere.

1062
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:27,058
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him!

1063
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:28,560
No!

1064
01:33:28,644 --> 01:33:30,228
You can't.

1065
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,689
I won't.

1066
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,860
I hope that you choke on that.

1067
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:41,865
You don't mean that, darling!

1068
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:51,291
I would never have hired Lee Clayton
if those rustlers hadn't killed Pete Marker.

1069
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:54,878
This has nothing to do with Pete, or law,
or stealing horses, and you know it.

1070
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,505
- Then what does it have to do with?
- Tom Logan.

1071
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:59,090
Tom Logan.

1072
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:02,886
Well, I never even think about him.

1073
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:06,056
You can't bear me being with him, can you?

1074
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:09,768
Now, Daddy, God damn it,
you find Lee Clayton and you stop him!

1075
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:14,689
You think I couldn't bear living here alone,
don't you?

1076
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:17,067
Stop Lee Clayton? No.

1077
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,364
No, I won't.

1078
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:32,248
What the hell are you doing?

1079
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:34,501
Cal's got me looking out for Lee Clayton.

1080
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:37,087
Come on down. Old Buck come up lame.

1081
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:40,382
- Give me a hand, God damn it.
- Easy, Buck.

1082
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,467
Come on, now.

1083
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:45,720
The only God damn intelligent horse...

1084
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:46,930
Easy, boy.

1085
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:49,849
I had him.

1086
01:34:56,148 --> 01:34:59,359
You think anybody could do it? I mean...

1087
01:35:00,903 --> 01:35:02,570
An ordinary fellow?

1088
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,242
I don't know.

1089
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:13,623
It seemed like somebody
ought to be able to get the job done.

1090
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:17,168
Just watch it, is all.

1091
01:35:20,464 --> 01:35:22,757
I'll tell you one thing, though...

1092
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:26,511
Don't start talking to him.

1093
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:30,223
I don't care what the plan is,
as long as you get us the hell out of here.

1094
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:34,102
Yeah, that's what I'd like.
Let's just pull our socks up and get out.

1095
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:36,479
We're gonna hit Braxton.

1096
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:41,985
We're gonna take everything he's got.
Blooded stock and all.

1097
01:35:42,027 --> 01:35:43,987
I think that's the least we can do.

1098
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:46,072
And maybe flush us a regulator.

1099
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,908
Yeah, well, I would love to include
the old man.

1100
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:51,995
A.44.40 in the brainpan
would be my sentence for him.

1101
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:55,039
Now I don't know why you don't want
to go along with that, Tom.

1102
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:56,624
I'd just as soon we didn't, Cal.

1103
01:35:56,667 --> 01:36:00,170
I want to know on what grounds you don't
wanna shoot Braxton like he deserves?

1104
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:03,757
We ain't gonna do it because
I said we ain't gonna do it!

1105
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:08,261
Now, am I perfectly clear on that, Cal?

1106
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:10,597
God damn it, let's not start that stuff.

1107
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:11,848
Yeah, really.

1108
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:14,559
Tom, it's only gonna wreck the whole job.

1109
01:36:14,643 --> 01:36:15,685
Cal.

1110
01:36:29,533 --> 01:36:32,786
Hey, Woodruff,
Braxton's got you nighthawking.

1111
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:36,039
Hey, Mr. Logan, what you doing
out of bed at this hour?

1112
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:38,500
Looking for a better life, Woodruff.

1113
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:40,543
What do you know that's new and exciting?

1114
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:41,961
Same old thing.

1115
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:44,297
What have you got in here?

1116
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:50,428
.37. And I got the horse bit.

1117
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,098
You're gonna take them?

1118
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:58,728
You bet. Want to get down now

1119
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:04,484
and reach me over that bird's head Colt
you got stuck in your shirt there.

1120
01:37:04,568 --> 01:37:06,820
Butt first, if you please, Woodruff.

1121
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:28,758
You think you're smart, don't you?

1122
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:30,844
Yeah, well, I ain't dumb, and I ain't tied up.

1123
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:35,473
You just lay on that soft spot.

1124
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:37,892
Tom, you're slicker
than snot on a doorknob.

1125
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:39,769
Why, thank you, Cary.

1126
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:46,276
I'll tell you one God damn thing,

1127
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:50,446
old Braxton's gonna be one surprised-ass
son of a bitch, ain't he?

1128
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:57,495
You know, I regret Pete Marker
wasn't here to get the news,

1129
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,289
that sorry bag of shit.

1130
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:03,459
We'll see him in hell, that son of a bitch,
if he don't turn out to be the Devil himself.

1131
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:05,587
Shut up, Si, you're gonna put
these damn horses

1132
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:07,463
all the way down to Kansas without us!

1133
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:10,967
Let's push, boys. I feel eyes all over us.

1134
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:34,282
That relay ranch is dead.

1135
01:38:34,783 --> 01:38:37,660
- Anybody got a preferred district?
- Hells Gate for me.

1136
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:41,664
Big Hole? I'll meet you there. Cal?

1137
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:45,501
I suppose. Shit, that's all that's left.

1138
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:48,171
All right, we'll meet back at the old cabin.
Cary?

1139
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:49,255
Yeah, all right.

1140
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:53,343
Remember, I want to get $20 dollars a head
for these, or we'll be doing this job...

1141
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:10,526
Well, I could have picked off
one or two of them, maybe

1142
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:12,445
but we'd have lost the rest for sure.

1143
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:16,240
Well, now, supposing you had a barn
full of nasty old bats

1144
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:18,201
and you wanted to get rid of them.

1145
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:20,536
Well, the worst thing you could do
is just get your gun

1146
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:23,414
and just start shooting and banging around

1147
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:26,334
and what good would it do you?
It wouldn't do a damn bit of good.

1148
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:29,045
They'd all leave and then they'd be back
by 7:30 in the morning.

1149
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:31,464
Now, if you want to get rid of
a whole lot of evil bats,

1150
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:33,383
there's only one way.

1151
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:35,051
And the way is this...

1152
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,928
You wait till the dawn comes.

1153
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:40,556
About 4:30, and you're waiting outside
by the barrels there.

1154
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:45,561
And then, you close the door real quick
and all of the bats are inside

1155
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:49,565
and then while they're sleeping,
the lovely little sweethearts,

1156
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:53,111
you have every one
of the dirty little buggers at your mercy.

1157
01:39:53,195 --> 01:39:54,612
And that's the only way you can do it.

1158
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:57,699
Well, that's all very informative.

1159
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,243
But every horse I own is gone.

1160
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:04,706
And the only way you're gonna get paid
is if I get them back.

1161
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:09,502
I don't care a damn about that.

1162
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,963
I always finish the work.

1163
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:16,634
And I don't give a damn whether or not
I get paid.

1164
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:21,014
And talking about horses,

1165
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:23,349
I think I know the horse
that you're worrying about.

1166
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,310
- He wears a black hat, he's two legged...
- Shut up!

1167
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:28,938
And I think I know where he stands at stud.

1168
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:31,816
Shut up! You're out of control,
you're through!

1169
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,985
I want you off the place. Now, git!

1170
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:37,113
Well, it is your place, sir.

1171
01:40:37,322 --> 01:40:40,783
But the work is mine
and I'll have the say about that.

1172
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:45,955
Come on now, Jess,
we know when we're not wanted.

1173
01:40:46,331 --> 01:40:48,708
Let's go out to the manhunt now.

1174
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,961
You lazy no-good bastards,
get back to work

1175
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,671
or I'll fire every damn one of you.

1176
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:15,318
They call this country Hells Gate.

1177
01:41:17,821 --> 01:41:21,532
When my dad came in here it was nothing
but a bunch of savage Indians...

1178
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:24,077
And Jesuits.

1179
01:41:27,289 --> 01:41:30,333
Old Thomas Jefferson said
that he was a warrior

1180
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:33,294
so his son could be a farmer,

1181
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:35,755
so his son could be a poet.

1182
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,345
And I raise cattle
so my son can be a merchant,

1183
01:41:43,806 --> 01:41:47,100
so his son can move to Newport,
Rhode Island and buy a sailboat

1184
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:50,853
and never see one of these bastard-ass
son of a bitching mountains again.

1185
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:58,194
Who was Thomas Jefferson?

1186
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:03,366
A guy back East.

1187
01:42:07,955 --> 01:42:10,623
I'll bet you're about done in.
You had a long day.

1188
01:42:10,707 --> 01:42:11,874
That's true.

1189
01:42:13,043 --> 01:42:15,753
Mother, you want to show our boy
the bunkhouse?

1190
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:17,046
Surely.

1191
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:20,133
I'll bring him a blanket.

1192
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:24,053
I'll see you before you start out
in the morning.

1193
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:25,429
Fine.

1194
01:42:26,431 --> 01:42:29,600
And let me thank you again
for selling me those horses.

1195
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:31,352
It's my pleasure.

1196
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:36,107
And my compliments to the artist
who changed those brands.

1197
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:37,859
Was it you?

1198
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:44,407
I learned it from a nice boy from Newport,
Rhode Island with no sailboat.

1199
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:48,202
They hung him in a cottonwood,
south of the Shonkin Sag by the neck,

1200
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:50,329
until dead, that would be.

1201
01:43:01,633 --> 01:43:03,593
You've got five minutes.

1202
01:43:05,762 --> 01:43:08,681
Wait, it would help

1203
01:43:09,057 --> 01:43:12,018
- if you got out of your drawers altogether.
- No!

1204
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:15,354
What good is it keeping them on one leg?

1205
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:17,440
Why don't you shut up?

1206
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:21,277
You've only got four of your minutes left.

1207
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:27,491
And besides, I'm beginning to chafe.

1208
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:38,794
Honey.

1209
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:18,793
Kid. Here.

1210
01:44:18,835 --> 01:44:21,504
Here's a buck. Go get me a whiskey,
and the rest is yours.

1211
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:23,714
Good stuff. Go on, hurry up.

1212
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:35,768
Thanks.

1213
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:03,254
Hold these, Junior.

1214
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:09,051
I won't be but a minute,
then we'll go get us something to eat.

1215
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:55,431
I ain't got but $54 dollars, mister.

1216
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:58,517
But I want all three horses. Or nothing.

1217
01:46:00,812 --> 01:46:02,271
What have you got to trade?

1218
01:46:04,941 --> 01:46:06,025
A clarinet.

1219
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:15,117
All right, I'll take it.

1220
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:37,283
I can't use it.

1221
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,416
Here, let me try it on.

1222
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:51,714
Put your arm in. You can't tell till it's on.

1223
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:56,552
- It fits perfect...
- I don't want the God damn thing.

1224
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:03,285
Smoked meat.

1225
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:24,723
Old smoked meat.

1226
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:34,692
Where's Tom Logan?

1227
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:46,036
I couldn't get him to come out.

1228
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,330
God.

1229
01:49:52,877 --> 01:49:54,461
Too proud, huh?

1230
01:49:56,464 --> 01:49:57,715
I reckon.

1231
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:12,313
I'd like about anything but getting burnt up.

1232
01:50:28,246 --> 01:50:31,248
Well, you're about the last of your kind,
old man.

1233
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:36,295
If I was a better businessman
than I am a man hunter,

1234
01:50:36,379 --> 01:50:38,213
I'd put you in the circus.

1235
01:50:49,017 --> 01:50:52,227
You know, about this time of year,
Indian summer,

1236
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:53,854
it's getting there,

1237
01:50:54,397 --> 01:50:57,024
they say you can see
the Star of Bethlehem,

1238
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,568
if you look real good.

1239
01:51:00,403 --> 01:51:02,321
I seen it once or twice.

1240
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:07,534
But you gotta look away
and then you gotta look at it, see,

1241
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:09,995
and you gotta look just a minute like that.

1242
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:14,249
See what I mean?

1243
01:51:40,235 --> 01:51:43,195
Well, old Granny's getting tired now.

1244
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:52,181
Cal?

1245
01:52:58,104 --> 01:52:59,188
Si?

1246
01:53:19,709 --> 01:53:21,043
Oh, my God.

1247
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:22,938
No, kiss first.

1248
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:31,446
You've the lips of Salome

1249
01:54:32,156 --> 01:54:34,157
and the eyes of Cleopatra.

1250
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:52,134
I dedicate this song
to the only woman I ever loved.

1251
01:54:55,805 --> 01:54:59,057
I'm too shy to turn around
and say it to your face.

1252
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:01,977
But I mean it from my heart.

1253
01:55:03,104 --> 01:55:05,439
I don't love you, you harlot.

1254
01:55:05,481 --> 01:55:08,317
I'm not even speaking to you.
Do you know that?

1255
01:55:12,405 --> 01:55:15,532
Come on. Would you?

1256
01:55:17,493 --> 01:55:21,330
That for you,
and your disloyalty and your treachery.

1257
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:25,167
Dear heart.

1258
01:55:47,315 --> 01:55:49,775
Say good night to Granny.

1259
01:55:51,027 --> 01:55:52,653
I'll play you a tune.

1260
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,840
Well, that's a fine thing.

1261
01:56:14,425 --> 01:56:17,511
You pissed
right in the middle of my love song.

1262
01:56:20,264 --> 01:56:22,683
God, pissing on my song.

1263
01:56:41,536 --> 01:56:42,661
Well.

1264
01:57:13,484 --> 01:57:14,943
You know what woke you up?

1265
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:20,449
Lee, you just had your throat cut.

1266
01:58:00,865 --> 01:58:01,865
Where is he?

1267
01:58:21,552 --> 01:58:23,136
He's in there.

1268
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:40,320
All the rest of the hands left
a couple days ago except for Vern here.

1269
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:44,783
- I'm staying. You betcha.
- It's all right, Vern.

1270
01:58:49,372 --> 01:58:51,331
I told him I was leaving last night

1271
01:58:52,166 --> 01:58:54,417
and he sort of came unraveled.

1272
01:58:56,087 --> 01:58:57,504
He's just lost himself.

1273
01:59:00,925 --> 01:59:04,386
Well, all I can say is
he'd better leave the room

1274
01:59:04,428 --> 01:59:06,388
'cause I'm gonna do it regardless.

1275
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:08,682
- Get out of the way, Vern.
- No.

1276
01:59:08,724 --> 01:59:10,225
You recognize this?

1277
01:59:12,061 --> 01:59:15,397
- You recognize it?
- No.

1278
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:18,817
Please don't shoot him.

1279
01:59:18,901 --> 01:59:21,570
What the hell
are you caterwauling about, Vern?

1280
01:59:21,654 --> 01:59:23,905
Get out of the way, Vern,
before I put one into you!

1281
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:26,408
You might as well. He's all I got. No.

1282
01:59:28,369 --> 01:59:30,996
Just go ahead, he's all I have.

1283
01:59:31,914 --> 01:59:33,790
Yes, sir. Shoot me.

1284
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:37,586
Shoot me, yes, shoot me!

1285
01:59:41,674 --> 01:59:44,301
Get out of here!
Get that son of a bitch away!

1286
01:59:44,385 --> 01:59:47,304
- Vern, will you get away?
- I will. You betcha.

1287
01:59:50,558 --> 01:59:52,684
- I'm sorry, Tom!
- What for?

1288
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:55,270
For everything.

1289
01:59:59,108 --> 02:00:00,442
Your friends, are they...

1290
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:05,238
Yeah.

1291
02:00:18,794 --> 02:00:22,631
- What were you gonna do, just take off?
- Yes.

1292
02:00:25,676 --> 02:00:26,718
What did you expect?

1293
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,180
To see you, for one thing.

1294
02:00:35,561 --> 02:00:38,647
- Did you think I'd be above ground?
- Well, of course.

1295
02:00:38,731 --> 02:00:39,731
Why of course?

1296
02:00:39,815 --> 02:00:42,400
Because I just can't imagine you dead.

1297
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:47,113
My God, are you gonna make me say it?

1298
02:00:50,785 --> 02:00:51,826
Tom!

1299
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:59,394
You just about done it?

1300
02:02:00,855 --> 02:02:02,230
Just about.

1301
02:02:05,526 --> 02:02:08,194
Well, I think I found a buyer for the ranch.

1302
02:02:08,904 --> 02:02:11,573
I'm going into Absaroka
now to see about it,

1303
02:02:12,074 --> 02:02:13,742
and find a place for Vern.

1304
02:02:19,165 --> 02:02:20,165
I'm glad.

1305
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,295
You know, I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

1306
02:02:25,379 --> 02:02:27,255
trying to get back at somebody.

1307
02:02:29,633 --> 02:02:31,092
Why'd you say that?

1308
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:34,888
No reason.

1309
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:44,397
Why, hell, neither do I.

1310
02:02:49,987 --> 02:02:51,613
But where do you think you'll be

1311
02:02:53,074 --> 02:02:55,909
in about six months?

1312
02:02:57,953 --> 02:03:00,914
Well, if I was to guess, I'd say

1313
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:02,916
north of the Breaks,

1314
02:03:03,834 --> 02:03:06,252
there's the little Rockies up there,

1315
02:03:06,295 --> 02:03:09,130
and a lot of little valleys
are supposed to have water year around.

1316
02:03:13,469 --> 02:03:15,428
Sounds like a real good guess.
