1
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,757
The first time I saw this country,

2
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:53,807
it had buffalo grass
and bluejoint up to the stirrups.

3
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:57,936
By the second year we had
8,000 Texas half-bred cattle

4
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:03,228
and over 3,500 volumes of
English literature in my library.

5
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:07,233
We just cut out
the unbranded stock

6
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:10,405
and divided 'em up between the outfits.

7
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:14,750
There was no arguin'
over mavericks like today.

8
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:17,201
You got it good today.

9
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:21,631
Two per cent annual loss then.
Now it's seven from rustling alone,

10
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:27,630
not to mention winterkill, calving loss,
miring down in the spring.

11
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:35,851
How many are you?

12
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:44,440
Mr Braxton, did you see they sew old boot
tops on the saddle to hold ammunition?

13
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:47,692
Pete, don't pester him
if he doesn't wanna be pestered.

14
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:51,693
Well, it'd just be awful nice
to know the whole story.

15
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:56,365
Well... it's beautiful country.

16
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:00,917
Yes, sir. It sure is.

17
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,545
You especially feel that now?

18
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,172
Yeah.

19
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:53,428
Sh, sh, sh.

20
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:13,158
I sure hope them sportin' ladies
don't get sunburned.

21
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:16,991
I like 'em white as pastry.

22
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,664
Ladies.

23
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,761
Are we all set here?

24
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:38,347
All set, Pete.

25
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:54,902
Shall we start the horse... or will you?

26
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:58,285
I will, sir.

27
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,410
Well, that's one of them.

28
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:42,990
His name was Sandy Chase and he came
here from Rhode Island with the army.

29
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,368
He was 24 years old.

30
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:54,259
We lost seven per cent of stock between
spring and fall last year, to rustlers.

31
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:58,337
You always mention the percentage.
I wonder why you do that.

32
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:01,678
This is my fourth frontier
and I know how they run.

33
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:04,646
I was in the California gold fields
before I was 18.

34
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:08,640
I was at the rush at Alder Gulch
and I went to South America.

35
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:12,726
These long ropers in the Missouri Breaks
are a mixed bag.

36
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:15,485
Barbers from Minneapolis,

37
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:20,991
failed grangers, Scandinavian half-breeds,
wolfers and woodcutters,

38
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:25,120
dishonest apprentices,
raftsmen, poisoners.

39
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,625
You give them a chance
and they'll waste everything.

40
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:41,009
You're astonished at my arrogance,
at not even having a trial, aren't you?

41
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:43,807
Then why don't you get over it?

42
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:48,563
Our situation has become
nearly as bad as it could be.

43
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:53,069
Honey, pull down Tristram Shandy again
for me, would you?

44
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,626
Daddy.

45
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:17,466
Excuse me.

46
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:32,438
Come on! Giddap! Yah!

47
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:07,641
Got the gate.

48
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:24,489
How'd she go, Tom?

49
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,072
Everybody else been back a day.

50
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:32,786
Brought in about 14 head
of the first-class order.

51
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,043
Yeah.

52
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:38,170
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,337
How was Wyoming?

54
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:44,678
It was fine.

55
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:50,762
Spent a couple of days in KC trying to
keep from associating with criminals.

56
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:54,977
Why, they've hit the Union Pacific
down there so many times

57
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:58,774
the place has begun to look like
a lawmen's convention.

58
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:01,193
They got two Pinkerton in KC

59
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:06,151
and I do believe one of 'em
was the legendary Charlie Siringo.

60
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,781
Did he claim to be a border cowboy?

61
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,167
Can't remember.
Said he could talk Mexican.

62
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:16,335
Yeah, that's him.

63
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:20,164
How'd you know it was a detective?

64
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:25,010
Rancher's wife wanting to go to bed
with him. He kept givin' her a "no".

65
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,677
Damned if I can understand that.

66
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:30,845
- Well, I took care of her, Cal.
- You did that, huh?

67
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:34,478
You're damn sure.
Had a good time too, thank you.

68
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,101
Did you?

69
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:41,275
Spent the night in Martinsdale.
Couldn't get no credit at the whorehouse,

70
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:45,652
so I picked up this chubby little girl
off some sodbuster's outfit.

71
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:48,240
Yeah... How was she?

72
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,170
About like a Swiss clock. Same exact
movement over and over again.

73
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,628
Yeah.

74
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,422
- It was Sandy, huh?
- Yeah.

75
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,758
Yeah.

76
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,562
Sandy's gone. He's dead.

77
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:33,396
David Braxton's foreman...
What's his name, Cary?

78
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,731
- Pete Marker.
- Pete Marker.

79
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,530
...caught him and they hung him.

80
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:42,064
Goddamn it.

81
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,534
I knew somebody's bunch
wasn't in that corral.

82
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,660
Little Tod was in town.
Everybody was at the hanging.

83
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,124
- How'd Sandy go out?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

84
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,467
They hung him up on a cottonwood,
though, and he sort of...

85
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,051
He sort of what?

86
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:14,059
Sort of strangled for a while.

87
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:18,110
Braxton was there dressed in a suit.

88
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:21,071
- Lookin' like God.
- Hah!

89
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,993
Goddamn.

90
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,240
I'll tell you, the first time I met Sandy...

91
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:32,580
Listen at this, now.

92
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,078
The first time I met Sandy,
he was rustling on his own.

93
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,257
He had a stolen cavalry pony
and he kept this dog.

94
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:45,381
As soon as he killed a steer, he'd cut
the brand off and feed it to the dog.

95
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:47,969
He said to get enough
evidence to convict him

96
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:51,017
they'd have to pick through
the dog's shit for a week

97
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:54,015
before they could find the brand.

98
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,739
My aunt ran a laundry in St Paul.

99
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:12,579
Got strangled by a Chinaman
while she's washing her dog.

100
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:15,661
It's easy to die. Easy!

101
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,289
Well, they sure killed Sandy.

102
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:24,635
He was the only comedian in this outfit.
Every outfit oughta have a comedian.

103
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,881
You can't run that many rustled horses
across open ground.

104
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:30,932
I know I've been saying that.
But you can't.

105
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:36,682
What do we do, Tom? Open up a stand
and sell stolen horses over the counter?

106
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,433
No. We gotta get a relay ranch
halfway across

107
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:43,024
so as we got somewheres
to relay 'em at.

108
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:47,532
- That's right.
- That's just really great.

109
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,698
Only we ain't got a ranch.

110
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,493
We ain't got no money!
The only horses we got are out there.

111
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:57,039
We can't move them across the breaks
without everybody knowing.

112
00:13:57,168 --> 00:14:00,003
Let's just stick up the NP Railroad
and buy a ranch.

113
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,003
Hell, let's rob a bank.

114
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:06,081
If we're gonna get hung for rustlin' horses,
we oughta be robbin' trains.

115
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:09,173
Why don't you boys join
that Hole-in-the-Wall bunch

116
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:12,721
and you'll be around people
that think like that?

117
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:24,069
Boy, a couple of years ago they'd have
put Sandy in Red Lodge penitentiary,

118
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,235
weavin' bridles.

119
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:32,655
Seems like there's
something new in the air.

120
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,376
I bet you Marker'll bait crows with Sandy
for a week before he'll cut him down.

121
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:45,419
I worked for that son of a bitch once
on the reservation roundup.

122
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,302
He will leave Sandy in the trees.

123
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:54,923
When we was fightin' in Kansas,
we had relays all over the damn place.

124
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,811
We relayed a cousin of mine

125
00:14:57,937 --> 00:15:01,437
all the way from Medicine Tree
to the hot springs in New Mexico.

126
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,475
He beat the telegraph.

127
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,106
Took the detectives two years to cover
the same ground he'd covered in a week.

128
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:12,451
And when they got there
he was in his grave up on the Chama.

129
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:17,322
Why was you havin' to move
this cousin around so much?

130
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:20,126
He did card tricks.

131
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,291
I get it.

132
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,291
He done a trick for this nigger on
the Chama. The nigger throttled him.

133
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:31,883
Mm-hm. I see.

134
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:37,632
Say, Cal...

135
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:41,352
Why don't we put that relay
in Braxton's backyard?

136
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,482
Yeah.

137
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,987
It beats sendin' three or four horses
at a time out into Kansas.

138
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,402
The law there is pretty effective now.

139
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:03,706
I get a kick out of Little Tod.
He says we oughta rob a train.

140
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,173
No...

141
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,503
I'm tired, Cal.

142
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:20,097
I'm gonna turn in.
Tomorrow we have a nice day.

143
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:29,190
Too bad about Sandy.

144
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:54,186
All right, move over there. Move, move!

145
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:57,239
I want you to uncouple that car. Hurry up!

146
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,901
I can't do it. I'm not sure I'm able to do it.

147
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:03,160
Just get down there and pull the pin out.

148
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:07,785
- I'm a clerk. I'm not mechanical.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

149
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,890
Whoo-hoo!

150
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:40,029
- Get the money out. What's your name?
- Nelson.

151
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,069
Nelson, you do this right,

152
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:47,114
you can say you've seen Jesse James
and lived to tell the story.

153
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,919
You're not Jesse James.

154
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:53,460
You ain't Charlie Siringo.
Just give me the money, Nelson.

155
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:57,967
- I'm not permitted to touch this.
- Gimme the goddamn money.

156
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:04,338
Whoa!

157
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:17,685
Gee!

158
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:21,736
- Don't start blamin' me.
- I am blamin' you.

159
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,655
This is it on trains. This is it.

160
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:26,068
God Almighty.

161
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:29,242
This is it. No more trains, Tod.

162
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,578
- I just don't wanna get blamed.
- Sh...

163
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,001
We got it! It's all over the place.

164
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,839
Yahoo!

165
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:40,291
We got it.

166
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:46,799
- You need some help?
- Just pick up the money, goddamn it.

167
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:48,761
Agh!

168
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:55,351
But they're all ones.
Tom, they're all ones.

169
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:01,905
- Where am I gonna put 'em all?
- I don't wanna hear that now. Just...

170
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,327
Ain't it just terrible?

171
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:10,997
The next time you mention trains,
it's gonna get worse.

172
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,995
You boys new at this?

173
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,593
Appreciate your concern, Nelson.

174
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:27,343
Yahoo!

175
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,801
Let's get every goddamn one up.

176
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:33,891
Hey, look! There's tens in the water.

177
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,858
Get in there, Tod.
Get in the water. Get those tens.

178
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:39,392
Yahoo!

179
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,200
Little Tod...

180
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:53,867
Get out of my way.

181
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,047
Come on. Let's get outta here
with what we got.

182
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:24,029
Mornin', my little darlin'.

183
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,739
Hey, Si. We'll see 'em in church.

184
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:35,620
I think all of you working men and women

185
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,955
have had time now to consider
this case before us.

186
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:42,208
- There's Braxton.
- I have reviewed its details,

187
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:46,007
and now I feel secure enough
to pronounce sentence.

188
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,506
Subject, of course,
to your scrutiny and support.

189
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,096
Make him confess first.

190
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:55,512
I think the kindest thing
we can do to this bird

191
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:58,398
is to send him up to the territorial prison.

192
00:21:58,524 --> 00:22:03,270
He's been about as cooperative
as any prisoner we've tried around here.

193
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:07,781
- I see no direct call to hang him.
- Don't he look like God?

194
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,325
Who's got an opinion about
how long we might send him up?

195
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:14,538
- Life is indicated.
- He'll take anything.

196
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,872
How would 10 to 20 sound to you?

197
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:21,129
Sounds about right to me.
How soon would I be eligible for parole?

198
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:24,126
In about two weeks.

199
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:30,632
Anything you'd like to say
before we send you to your just deserts?

200
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:33,256
And if I may speak for the court,

201
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:36,228
we would prefer
that it be something colourful,

202
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,520
life on the frontier being what it is.

203
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,397
Just that...

204
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:50,318
it may seem to you boys
like a hard way to make the papers,

205
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:53,986
but I'm not ashamed of robbing that train,

206
00:22:54,121 --> 00:23:00,491
of blowing bridges, sticking up banks, or
for my careless devil-may-care gunplay.

207
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:06,419
I'm not ashamed of pissing away
the money on hard living either,

208
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,670
because I'm that kind of guy.

209
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:13,089
But as a concession to me
for my cooperation,

210
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:16,924
I would like you all
to refer to me from now on

211
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:19,634
as "The Lonesome Kid".

212
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,939
Especially in front of outsiders
here in the West.

213
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:31,024
That's enough of that! Let's all go up
to the bar and make fools of ourselves.

214
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,755
Yahoo!

215
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:54,548
Whoo! I haven't danced like that
since Chicago.

216
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:56,390
I'm Tom Logan.

217
00:23:56,517 --> 00:24:03,018
I'd like to congratulate you, sir,
on your treatment of that impostor.

218
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:05,818
Oh... My daughter, Jane.

219
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,319
Hello.

220
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,446
People have told me
I should talk to you, Mr Braxton.

221
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:13,858
I just sold a family implement business
in the Shonkin range

222
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:17,492
and I'm thinkin' of buying a small ranch.

223
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:24,160
You done so well I'd like
a piece out by you for good luck.

224
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:30,007
Well... the Cannon Ranch is for sale.

225
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,505
Isn't much. Four sections and a cabin.
Pole corrals around it.

226
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,340
But it's well watered,
and pretty fair shelter.

227
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:44,392
The owner's living in town now.
Has a cooperage at the end of Main,

228
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:46,563
past the livery.

229
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:50,855
I understand you had
some rustlin' problems.

230
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:53,823
Seven per cent losses per annum.

231
00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:00,748
You should know about that.
First year, that might just break you.

232
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:02,782
Mm...

233
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:06,961
I understand
you had to hang someone here.

234
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,212
I did that.

235
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,340
Oh, that's tough.

236
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:18,046
What was this?
Some kind of a desperado?

237
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,557
No.

238
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:24,476
He was a thief, with probably a million
good reasons for being on hard times.

239
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:28,188
The main thing is that
we put him out of his misery.

240
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,978
Don't you believe
in hangin' thieves, miss?

241
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,155
No, sir, I don't. Do you?

242
00:25:37,284 --> 00:25:42,196
I surely do. How in the world else
are we gonna have law and order?

243
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:46,579
Well, what do you know?

244
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,957
Maybe you can buy that Cannon Ranch,
get started in the cattle business.

245
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,166
With your attitude toward human life,

246
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,716
you may yet get to be
one of the barons of this prairie,

247
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:01,472
and have your picture on page one,
or page three, of the Chicago papers.

248
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,595
And for your birthday you can have
a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice,

249
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,313
just the way the other hangmen
up this way do.

250
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:14,235
You sound bitter, lady.

251
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:17,234
You should have seen
that young man's face.

252
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:20,118
- He did not die quickly.
- I don't wanna hear about it.

253
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:23,280
I don't think you can really picture
the man's face.

254
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:26,581
I don't want to hear about it, miss.

255
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:30,588
Thank you for your information,
Mr Braxton.

256
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:36,052
I'll go over to the cooperage and ask
Mr Cannon about them four sections.

257
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,846
Pleasure to meet you too, miss.

258
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:57,896
Welcome to town, now.

259
00:26:58,032 --> 00:27:01,365
Damn, I feel better now.

260
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,533
- Damned if I don't.
- Me too.

261
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:15,293
Oh, God! You didn't cut him down yet.

262
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:17,464
We did! That's...

263
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:21,005
Whoa!

264
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,806
- Oh...
- Oh, Pete.

265
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,722
My God. They've killed my man.

266
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:38,569
- Si, are we gonna go to that whorehouse?
- Where the hell you clodhoppers been at?

267
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:42,066
File that. We got it.
Let's go for a ride.

268
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:45,118
I wanna go to a whorehouse,
play cards, get drunk.

269
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:49,991
We can go to the whorehouse later.
Ain't you got no pride of ownership?

270
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,577
I buy you a brand-new ranch.
Do you wanna ride out and look at it?

271
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:56,797
Hell, we own it, we can go anytime.
Let's go for a drink.

272
00:27:56,924 --> 00:28:00,174
- Let's play cards...
- Let's go to the whorehouse.

273
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:04,763
You're gonna have to pick and choose
on that cos the money's about all gone.

274
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,891
- The money can't be gone.
- Well, it is and I'm glad.

275
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,726
- I'm glad too.
- Why?

276
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,680
Because robbin' trains is...

277
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:16,357
We start a pattern of robbin' trains
and we're gonna get detectives.

278
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:19,819
From then, you can back
the calendar down till they hang us.

279
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:21,986
That's why.

280
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:31,620
I still think we should rob a bank.
Rob trains, rob a bank.

281
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,202
- All right, let's go to the whorehouse.
- Mm-mm.

282
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,838
You here for a party?

283
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,387
- That's right.
- What kind of a party?

284
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,735
Well...

285
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,361
You got any girls?

286
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:18,752
Go on, Si.

287
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:32,017
The girls here can show you
to the party rooms.

288
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,268
I like them ribbons.

289
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:38,769
Anybody want anything to eat?

290
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:45,693
Well, is he the one that I want.
You just come right on up here with me.

291
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:51,989
Where are the chubby ones?
I want a chub...

292
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:54,162
Oh, yeah.

293
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:58,501
Ain't that a match-up?
Ain't that a match-up?

294
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,250
Just like you and your horse, Little Tod.

295
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,684
- That one got away!
- You'll pay for that.

296
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,651
In my home town,
I'm considered a dangerous person.

297
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:27,613
Yeah? In your home town a man can get
a bad reputation for smokin' corn silk.

298
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,613
Cary'll stay at the breaks,
but somebody must tend this place.

299
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:36,614
I can tell you one damn thing,
it isn't gonna be me.

300
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,375
Agh!

301
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:46,297
I got you! Told you I was gonna get you,
you son of a bitch.

302
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,466
Here! How about this?

303
00:31:00,607 --> 00:31:03,063
I like this place, Cal.

304
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,276
- Yeah.
- I like it quiet.

305
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,279
Cary, don't throw them tools
down there like that, please.

306
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:19,789
I spent my first 18 years
on one of these goddamn things,

307
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:22,244
workin' for my uncle that raised me.

308
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:24,917
I worked myself cross-eyed too.

309
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:31,003
About the only thing I had for distraction
was this dog.

310
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:35,471
I'd had the dog since it was ten years old.

311
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:39,479
And he shot it...

312
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:44,147
for stickin' its tongue on a pat of butter.

313
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,560
So I stayed one more night.

314
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:53,448
And I killed his seed bull,
I rustled every damn horse he had

315
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:57,622
including a racer that I sold as
a cow pony to an Indian rancher,

316
00:31:57,748 --> 00:32:00,073
and I took the whole damn remuda.

317
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,542
I come within a hair's breadth
of sendin' him to kingdom come.

318
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:08,712
I was that close to shootin'
that son of a bitch in the brainpan.

319
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:16,047
I never did have that kind of background.

320
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:20,346
Never had nothin' neither.
My folks always wanted a place.

321
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:23,729
They was good people,
so I always saw it with their eyes.

322
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:26,099
I can see that.

323
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:32,238
But when you think about it, you wouldn't
want the weight of a damn place like this.

324
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:38,323
Do you do alterations too, ma'am?

325
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,498
Nope.

326
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:49,879
And I don't do
your wire-ripped shirts neither.

327
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:56,384
There you go.

328
00:32:56,515 --> 00:33:00,560
Si, you're beginnin' to sound
like a real old lady.

329
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:03,556
What do you say
we just jump this pissant seamstress?

330
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:07,769
You guys are soon gonna learn
to treat me nice.

331
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:10,772
- Yahoo!
- Whoa! Watch it!

332
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:12,564
Come on! I'll kill ya.

333
00:33:12,698 --> 00:33:16,067
Everybody's so scared of the Mounties
that nobody even tries.

334
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:18,028
The horses are hardly guarded.

335
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:23,748
- You talkin' to me about Canada again?
- You're goddamn right I am.

336
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,952
Them Mounties scares me, Cal.

337
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:29,585
Hell, they scare everybody.
That's why it'll be so easy.

338
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:31,921
The Indians won't touch them horses.

339
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,921
We can take all 60 of them ponies
at a walk.

340
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,965
All Canadian government brand?

341
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:47,056
Until we can get 'em to the breaks for
modification, and then down here to relay.

342
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,275
That doesn't quite
settle it though, does it?

343
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:52,858
No, it don't.

344
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:57,109
Someone's gonna have to stay here.

345
00:33:57,242 --> 00:34:00,113
Well, it isn't gonna be me.

346
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,538
It's gotta be one of the two of us,
and I'll tell you one thing.

347
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:08,450
You had all the fun on that train
while I baby-sat these savages.

348
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm going to Canada for sure.
That's settled. That's it.

349
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:34,192
I gotta stay on this
goddamn piece of ground.

350
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:37,405
Goddamn! I can't even believe this!

351
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:44,782
That is pitiful.
You assholes will just get lost.

352
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:50,502
- He was the best foreman.
- He was the only foreman I ever had.

353
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,579
- Pete Marker was a hard man.
- He surely was, David.

354
00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:59,758
He could break a horse better than
the bronc fighters. He could do every job.

355
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:02,462
He was a great ramrod.

356
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,391
He personified the American West
in the days of its rowdy youth.

357
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,976
- Sure did.
- Excuse me.

358
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,703
- Lee Clayton.
- Oh, my God, you gave me a scare.

359
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:09,371
- All I could see was your horse.
- That was all you were meant to see.

360
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:13,542
Is the owner about?

361
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,375
Who may I say is calling?

362
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:19,875
Lee Clayton. I just said that.

363
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,839
I have a short memory.

364
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:29,679
Well, I'll tell Daddy that you're here,

365
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:32,516
and then I can get back
to what I was doing before.

366
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:38,520
Tell him Lee Clayton from Medicine Hat,
Wyoming. Here on business.

367
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,895
- You got it?
- Yes.

368
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:04,633
- Come in. I've been expecting you.
- Oh, sir.

369
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:08,381
I don't know why it would not
have tired me more than it did,

370
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:14,057
to have travelled all this distance
without more than a catnap.

371
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:17,772
You've a wonderful set of books here, sir.

372
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:20,107
- Yes, I have.
- Truly, truly beautiful.

373
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,443
I don't spend the time with them I should.

374
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:29,820
I'm of the opinion... I would only claim
books that was about right from wrong.

375
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:34,617
Otherwise how are we to find
our paradise among the stars?

376
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:36,791
True. Please.

377
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:42,964
Oh, sir. I'm sorry for your trouble.
I wasn't aware.

378
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:46,676
Gentlemen, Robert E Lee Clayton.

379
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:53,884
I understand that you hung a thief

380
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:59,263
and neglected to find out where they were
caching the stock. How was that?

381
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:01,643
He didn't wanna talk. He was about to die.

382
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:05,693
Oh, I see. Then you pampered him.

383
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,860
- No, sir!
- We hung that man.

384
00:38:08,994 --> 00:38:12,445
Well, you pampered the man...
you pampered the man,

385
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:17,539
and the result of that
is the loss of this poor man's life!

386
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,327
- Please, this is outrageous.
- You, you, you...

387
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,999
Take your hands off!

388
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:31,636
Realise the fact that as a result of that
this poor man has lost his life.

389
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:37,686
If you'd invited me into the neighbourhood
before, it wouldn't have happened.

390
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:40,815
You've got to give me some thoughts.

391
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:45,946
I'm gonna turn my horse out.
Then I'll wash my body.

392
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:52,781
And, miss...
the only thing not on my diet

393
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:57,290
would be the green top of the beet
and okra.

394
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:03,504
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me,
but I'm under a severe attack from a tooth.

395
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,467
Sir. Miss.

396
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:15,928
- Where'd he come from?
- What was all that about?

397
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:20,473
I got recommendations for this man from
all the Wyoming outfits he's worked for.

398
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:23,893
- I'm assured that he's a top regulator.
- Regulator?

399
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:28,274
- You mean you asked him up here?
- You're damn right I did.

400
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:31,657
They killed my ramrod
and I want them to pay for it.

401
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:34,276
I always wondered
what Lee Clayton looked like.

402
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:37,283
And smelled like.

403
00:39:37,415 --> 00:39:39,704
I always figured him to be a little fella.

404
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,453
He's supposed to have a Creedmore rifle
he carries as a saddle gun.

405
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:45,830
Supposed to be able
to hit out to 500 yards.

406
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,753
- Oh, Mr Rate. 500 yards...
- I mean it.

407
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:52,052
He never carries a side arm,
so you know he's a dry-gulcher.

408
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,881
But he smells like a wet-gulcher
and he dresses like a clown.

409
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:59,469
He don't have no wife,
but he sure keeps himself spruced up.

410
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:05,144
Many a rustler has said his prayers when
he got a whiff of them lavender bath salts.

411
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:15,824
- Daddy, I wanna know how...
- Not now. Shh!

412
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:19,157
- Vern, scat. Out of here.
- You betcha. I will.

413
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:23,954
- Adios, buddies.
- Send you a postal card from Canada.

414
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:26,543
Cal, why can't I go to Canada?

415
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:29,342
You gotta tend to the cabin
in the breaks, Cary.

416
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:34,509
You don't hear Tom complainin'.
See you in a few weeks, Tom.

417
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:44,391
They'll be back, Buck.
Don't you worry about it.

418
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:58,159
Well, by gosh. Good mornin' to you, miss.

419
00:40:58,288 --> 00:41:02,451
Good morning to you, Mr Logan.
You bought this place already, huh?

420
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:04,126
Yes, ma'am.

421
00:41:04,252 --> 00:41:08,713
I guess that kinda
makes us neighbours, doesn't it?

422
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:13,963
- Where are you headed?
- Oh, I'm gonna go over on the table.

423
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:16,467
Well, may I accompany you?

424
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:18,637
No.

425
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,895
- Why not?
- No good reason. I don't want company.

426
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:26,057
Come on. Give me a chance.

427
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:29,939
Give you a chance.
Give you a chance for what?

428
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:35,491
Miss, I'm gonna take this opportunity
to be just a little damn bit offended.

429
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:38,155
Cos if there's anybody in this district

430
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:42,782
who's got a right to think of themselves
as wholesome companionship,

431
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:45,585
why, it's yours truly.

432
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:55,333
If you're such a wholesome companion,
what were you doing at the whorehouse?

433
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,510
Who in the world told you that?

434
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:00,806
Mary O'Connell,
that little blonde you paid for.

435
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,140
Well, I hope that's all she told you.

436
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:06,436
She told me everything.
We're starved for news out here.

437
00:42:06,564 --> 00:42:10,811
- All I ever hear about is grass.
- What's the matter with grass?

438
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:14,479
Samuel Johnson said
"A blade of grass is a blade of grass. "

439
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:19,276
- "Tell me about a human being. "
- I don't understand that.

440
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,658
It just means that Samuel Johnson
was as bored as I am with nature.

441
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,625
We had a famous painter
out here last year.

442
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:31,164
That man must have painted ten square
miles of canvas, not one human face.

443
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:36,458
I wish he'd painted that boy Sandy hangin'
up so decoratively against the mountains.

444
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:38,967
Because his pink tongue and white face

445
00:42:39,097 --> 00:42:41,802
would have set off
the green of Montana splendidly.

446
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:46,928
I mean, it would have made the
damnedest bank calendar you ever saw.

447
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:52,020
Well, you succeeded. This is where
I was coming to and you're still with me.

448
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,607
The persistence
of the young rancher, huh?

449
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:59,732
- Well, I know what I want is all.
- What do you want?

450
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,952
I mean, I know what it is
when I want something.

451
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:06,531
- Oh, come on!
- "Oh, come on" what?

452
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:11,411
- Why don't you just say what you mean?
- This is what I mean.

453
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:15,626
- Do you want me?
- What does that mean?

454
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,962
I mean you're followin' me around.
What you got in mind?

455
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:22,215
- Me?
- Sexual intercourse?

456
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,056
- Oh, my...
- Well, all right.

457
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:28,436
All right.

458
00:43:28,563 --> 00:43:31,766
Come on. Get down off your horse.

459
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,692
I'm not gonna have any hesitation from
you. Not from a frequenter of whores.

460
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:39,526
All right, all right. Just back off.

461
00:43:39,657 --> 00:43:42,611
I'm gonna step down at my own speed.

462
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:46,994
All right.

463
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,160
I'm going to lose it right here,
in all these blades of grass.

464
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,670
Do I have to come to you? All right.

465
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,923
- Hold it.
- What?

466
00:44:00,053 --> 00:44:02,923
Who asked you to do all this?

467
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:06,057
- Well, your entire behaviour...
- Never mind that.

468
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:09,304
I didn't ask you.
You said that you wanted it.

469
00:44:09,437 --> 00:44:11,975
- Well, do you?
- No.

470
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:16,056
- Well, you're not gonna get it.
- Keep the dang thing. I don't want it.

471
00:44:16,194 --> 00:44:20,903
- I forgot. You do have your whores.
- Sure do. Like 'em too.

472
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:23,523
I'll tell you something. If you want them...

473
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,286
I keep tellin' ya. I want them a lot.
I don't want you at all.

474
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:30,573
Why are you bein' so mean to me?

475
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:34,623
People have neglected to tell you
what a nasty little bitch you are,

476
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:37,328
and I'm makin' up for their negligence.

477
00:44:37,465 --> 00:44:40,668
I just seem mean.
I'm only being thorough.

478
00:44:46,391 --> 00:44:52,809
If you're gonna start that, I'm gonna go
home and shovel manure on the pansies.

479
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:58,308
Well, you just wait a minute
because I'm gonna stop.

480
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,363
You gonna talk nice?

481
00:45:04,492 --> 00:45:06,699
I will do my best.

482
00:45:07,412 --> 00:45:09,451
You bastard.

483
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:14,579
- Can I have a kiss?
- No. I hardly know you.

484
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:20,583
Why don't we take a walk and talk about
the Wild West and how to get out of it?

485
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:26,299
Well... all right. I can talk about that.

486
00:45:27,557 --> 00:45:30,392
Cal, I forgot how to tie a diamond hitch.

487
00:45:30,518 --> 00:45:33,638
- A squaw hitch is all you need.
- You'll be gone two weeks?

488
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:38,268
Give or take a few days. Cary, you're
gonna move some stock to make way.

489
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:40,477
- No more than two...
- Or three at a time.

490
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:44,823
- I've been doin' this for a while.
- I reckon you have. Let's go.

491
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:50,070
Keep low, boy.

492
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,789
Hell of a damn way to ride off.

493
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,967
- Stay with your horse.
- Get a hold.

494
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:09,140
Si, stay with your horse! Si!

495
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:12,848
Goddamn it, he knows what he's doing.

496
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:17,268
Si let go of the rope.

497
00:46:17,398 --> 00:46:19,438
Oh, Jesus.

498
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:21,939
- Help!
- You're gonna drown!

499
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,311
Help! Get me in.

500
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:33,243
We did it. We crossed
that son of a bitch, didn't we?

501
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:37,287
I couldn't swim,
but I was swimmin', right?

502
00:46:39,337 --> 00:46:41,080
I can! I did it!

503
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:43,787
We deserve a lot of damn credit.

504
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:47,590
We crossed the Mighty Mo
and I want some damn credit.

505
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,513
Supposin' if the catfish
in that son of a bitch could eat a pig.

506
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:55,097
Or a chicken.

507
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,436
Get out.

508
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:03,189
- Easy, now.
- Tom!

509
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:07,945
Hey, Tom!

510
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:11,159
Huh?

511
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:14,701
You're the only rancher
who hasn't met the new regulator.

512
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,452
Tom Logan, Robert E Lee Clayton.

513
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:21,996
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance, sir.

514
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,881
Damn near... sucked my boot off.

515
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:28,757
Pleasure to meet you.

516
00:47:28,886 --> 00:47:32,302
Regulator - ain't that like a dry-gulcher?

517
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,135
That's not the softest term
you could use, I'd say.

518
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:40,017
Well, a regulator...
Correct me if I'm wrong.

519
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:43,020
Isn't a regulator one of these boys

520
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,270
that shoots people
and don't never get near 'em?

521
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:48,147
That's it.

522
00:47:50,908 --> 00:47:55,286
Well, what about the binoculars?
What are they for?

523
00:47:56,164 --> 00:48:00,292
Well, I've taken to watchin'
funny-lookin' birds.

524
00:48:01,586 --> 00:48:03,377
I see.

525
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:05,580
Well, hell, I don't know.

526
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:10,211
I suppose if you didn't get a way off,
a mile or so to do the job,

527
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,421
you'd just get messy like I done here.

528
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:15,426
Easy, Tom. Don't let me down.

529
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:19,887
I've just heard this from all the other
dreamers tryin' to ranch around here.

530
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:26,735
Lee, did you ever hit a man from a mile off
while he was carryin' a pail of water?

531
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:29,530
A mile, well...

532
00:48:29,655 --> 00:48:32,193
But I don't remember the pail.

533
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,944
No, sir.

534
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:40,373
When you hang a man,
usually he has a chance to talk,

535
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,750
or say goodbye, write a letter...

536
00:48:44,837 --> 00:48:47,624
Besides, a Creedmore...

537
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:53,463
- It's a Creedmore, isn't it?
- It is a Creedmore, and a beautiful one.

538
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:56,514
Must make a pretty good
mess of a human.

539
00:48:56,641 --> 00:49:00,223
You hit a guy from 500 yards out, say,

540
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:05,560
why, the suddenness of it, he don't have a
few seconds to make his act of contrition.

541
00:49:05,691 --> 00:49:08,313
And you never have to look him in the eye.

542
00:49:08,444 --> 00:49:11,066
Right there, that makes all the difference.

543
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:15,277
I would disagree, sir. The thing that
makes all the difference in the world

544
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,739
is the fact that it accomplishes
the task, you see.

545
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:23,157
This old boy in Wyoming...

546
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:25,084
Whoa.

547
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:30,873
This old boy in Wyoming, he sat down
just to pull sandburs out of his trousers,

548
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:35,421
and his skull suddenly flew into pieces
about the size of your thumbnail.

549
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:40,300
That was the first time
I ever heard the term "regulator".

550
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,934
- That was the first time.
- First time.

551
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:49,687
What would be your line of work, sir?

552
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:53,069
I was in the implement business
up in the Shonkin Sag,

553
00:49:53,197 --> 00:49:56,566
but I started back in the ranch
south of here.

554
00:49:57,618 --> 00:50:01,118
You started back in? You was before...?

555
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:05,660
My family used to have a place,
but when they lost it I hired out.

556
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:07,869
Oh, I see.

557
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:12,132
I certainly wish you
good fortune, Mr Logan.

558
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:14,749
The times are hard on a small operator.

559
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,759
Heyah!

560
00:50:18,723 --> 00:50:21,759
I hope the damn horse thieves
leave you something.

561
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:25,178
- I hope so too.
- Good day to you, sir.

562
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,601
Bye-bye now.

563
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:31,480
This colt of yours will be all right
if you can find a wet mare.

564
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,650
- Is the mother dead?
- Yeah.

565
00:50:33,779 --> 00:50:37,777
She got bogged down in a mire
about a mile from here.

566
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:41,693
- See you later, Tom. Thanks.
- All right, Mr Braxton.

567
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:44,499
Damn those hands of mine.

568
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,789
Good luck, Old Sloppy.

569
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:02,971
Must have smelled something.

570
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,928
The closer you get towards Canada,
the more things eat your horses.

571
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:12,567
Probably smelled a bear or a cat
or some damn thing.

572
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:15,398
Either one would go ahead
and eat your horse...

573
00:51:15,529 --> 00:51:17,569
Whoa...

574
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:26,783
Damn! I don't know why they had
to put Canada way the hell up here.

575
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,715
Well, hello, Jane.

576
00:51:40,846 --> 00:51:42,886
Hello, Tom.

577
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:46,348
I didn't think I'd find you here.

578
00:51:46,477 --> 00:51:50,557
- Why'd you think that?
- Cos I haven't seen you.

579
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:55,601
You thought I was gonna
come courtin', didn't ya?

580
00:51:55,736 --> 00:51:58,144
Maybe so. Mm-hm.

581
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:02,777
You was too harsh to me last time.
I never kick a dead horse, lady.

582
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:12,167
That sure is some garden you've started
here. Have you had one before?

583
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:16,162
No. My aunt had one
and I kinda took it over.

584
00:52:17,383 --> 00:52:19,921
I ain't half bad at it though.

585
00:52:20,052 --> 00:52:22,092
No.

586
00:52:25,224 --> 00:52:28,391
Why don't you get down off your horse?

587
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:30,559
I will, thank you.

588
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:38,611
You're a lot nicer than you was before.
Why is that?

589
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:45,447
Well, you didn't come courtin' me
like I figured you would, and...

590
00:52:45,578 --> 00:52:47,820
I'm...

591
00:52:47,955 --> 00:52:50,197
You're what?

592
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,583
I'm tryin' to revive your interest.

593
00:52:53,711 --> 00:52:56,380
Oh, yeah?

594
00:52:56,505 --> 00:53:01,251
Well... come here a minute
and I'll show you something.

595
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:08,763
All right.

596
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:11,725
Now lift that up.

597
00:53:27,578 --> 00:53:30,745
Close her down. Garden's watered.

598
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,955
I admire you.

599
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:41,631
Come in the house.
I'll make you a cup of chinee tea.

600
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,798
Chinese tea?

601
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:58,358
Northern Pacific Railroad.
Where did you get these?

602
00:53:58,484 --> 00:54:00,523
Just souvenirs.

603
00:54:08,327 --> 00:54:10,367
Mm...

604
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,201
How long does the tea take?

605
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,575
Five or ten minutes.

606
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,796
Can I come over there?

607
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:30,848
I'll come over there if you ask me to.

608
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:40,514
Let's go over there.

609
00:54:46,657 --> 00:54:48,982
You sure about that?

610
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,119
That's right.

611
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:59,162
How do you know you're sure about that?

612
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,538
Well, why do you think?

613
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:09,421
Cos that's the reason why
you come out here in the first place.

614
00:55:11,265 --> 00:55:13,305
That's right.

615
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:19,100
This here tea's gonna get black as ink.

616
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,646
We'll write somebody a letter with it.

617
00:55:29,408 --> 00:55:32,326
Let's write your father a letter.

618
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:37,198
Tell him that you're the prisoner
of the chinee tea slavers.

619
00:56:11,408 --> 00:56:14,279
Would you like to do this?

620
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:20,206
Yeah... I would like to.

621
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:23,956
That's what I would like to do.

622
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:35,929
Sorry.

623
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:15,802
God.

624
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,340
God, God.

625
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:35,106
Sniper, sniper, sniper.

626
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,990
Goddamn. They're pretty.

627
00:58:23,123 --> 00:58:26,955
Yeah. They're neat
little bastards, ain't they?

628
00:58:27,961 --> 00:58:31,247
Oh, boy. There's more of 'em
than I expected.

629
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:35,130
Yeah. Do you suppose
them catfish ever look up?

630
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,131
- Piss on them.
- From up here?

631
00:58:40,891 --> 00:58:42,931
Sh!

632
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,304
Supposed to be
the best police in the world.

633
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,355
- They don't scare me.
- Me neither.

634
00:58:52,486 --> 00:58:56,982
Let's take these horses to the home
of the brave and the land of the free.

635
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,314
- Not today.
- What?

636
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,776
Not today!

637
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:02,951
Goddamn.

638
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:12,710
I'm gonna have an awful lot of
explaining to do when I get home.

639
00:59:12,843 --> 00:59:16,461
But I'm not gonna lie my way
out of this one.

640
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:18,838
Yes, I am.

641
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:22,343
- Which one?
- I'm gonna lie my way out of it.

642
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,642
- Where'd she go?
- Who?

643
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:29,644
- Your ma.
- Oh...

644
00:59:29,776 --> 00:59:34,485
Well, she listened very carefully
to my father for about three years,

645
00:59:34,614 --> 00:59:36,192
weighed every word,

646
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:42,493
and then she up and ran off with the first
unreasonable man that she could find.

647
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:48,458
Wait a minute. Stop. This is a nice way
to ride, but I know a much better way.

648
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:52,085
Where are you goin'?

649
00:59:58,388 --> 01:00:00,428
Ooh!

650
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:05,093
- Well, that is clever.
- Yeah.

651
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:08,063
Would you say that this is lewd conduct?

652
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:11,266
Well, I couldn't say for sure.

653
01:00:12,486 --> 01:00:16,946
My father has a library full of law books,
cos he believes in the law.

654
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:20,656
He says that we haven't got
any law up here yet.

655
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,570
What brings that to your mind?

656
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:30,495
Because in one of those law books of his,
there's a whole section on lewd conduct.

657
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:34,543
- What about it?
- It's against the law.

658
01:00:41,765 --> 01:00:44,386
Are you an outlaw?

659
01:00:47,521 --> 01:00:54,318
I'm a jackpot rancher with a milk cow and
100 square foot of root vegetables. Why?

660
01:00:54,444 --> 01:00:58,738
- Why do you have so many guns?
- Because I'm a sportsman.

661
01:01:00,492 --> 01:01:03,362
Why do you have a sawed-off shotgun?

662
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:07,870
Well, because I'm a sawed-off sportsman.

663
01:01:10,127 --> 01:01:13,377
Well, something has sure
started in my thinking,

664
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:18,961
and I don't know why we should go on
if you're just gonna end up dead.

665
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:22,592
Whoa.

666
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:27,515
Can we get down here
for a while and talk?

667
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:32,691
- Yeah. OK.
- You can make it?

668
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,813
* When the trumpet of the Lord
shall sound and time shall be no more

669
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:23,861
* And the morning breaks
eternal, bright and fair

670
01:02:23,992 --> 01:02:27,942
* And the chosen ones shall gather
over on the other shore

671
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,207
* And the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there

672
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:36,581
* When the roll is called up yonder

673
01:02:36,713 --> 01:02:41,007
* When the roll is called up yonder...

674
01:02:41,134 --> 01:02:45,179
Now they've locked in with Jesus.
Let's do it.

675
01:02:45,305 --> 01:02:51,509
- Makes me feel real safe and peaceful.
- Well, that's what Sundays are for.

676
01:04:25,155 --> 01:04:28,571
For the best police in the world,
Mounties are dumber than sticks.

677
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,277
We just left 'em nothin'.

678
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:32,616
Ha-ha! Whoo!

679
01:04:52,724 --> 01:04:55,215
Damn.

680
01:04:55,352 --> 01:04:59,135
Shouldn't crawl up on people like that.

681
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:02,522
Well, I'm not the crawlin' kind.

682
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:07,478
I was just passin' by and I thought
I'd ask you a question or two.

683
01:05:07,614 --> 01:05:11,991
There was a family of Logans
out of Kaycee, Wyoming.

684
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:15,487
There was four brothers.
The youngest was a kid named Lonnie.

685
01:05:15,622 --> 01:05:17,780
They was all pretty quick,

686
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,620
except for Lonnie -
he was a fiddle player, and...

687
01:05:20,752 --> 01:05:23,207
They killed him off right quick.

688
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:27,003
Some of the ranchers had found him
thievin' or something like that.

689
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:31,795
Anyway, I was wonderin'...
would they be kin to ya?

690
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,803
No. No.

691
01:05:33,932 --> 01:05:38,392
Well, I didn't think so
because you don't carry a gun.

692
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,559
No, I never carry a gun.

693
01:05:43,233 --> 01:05:45,309
I never wear a gun neither.

694
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:50,070
Oh, once in a while I carry
this little darlin' around.

695
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:54,659
She's almost like a poem.
You know, it's all hand-done.

696
01:05:54,786 --> 01:05:57,111
Etched, you know, scratched in silver.

697
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,331
Oh, she's a beauty.
Made for the president of Mexico.

698
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,866
I diverted it for a hundred-dollar bill.

699
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:05,873
But it doesn't shoot worth a damn.

700
01:06:07,757 --> 01:06:13,344
Some damn fool came along
and filed off the top of the front sight.

701
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:19,182
And you have to sort of play with it.

702
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,646
It isn't easy.

703
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:28,100
Have a look at the rope.

704
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:33,949
Not bad.

705
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:36,115
There's one left.

706
01:06:44,544 --> 01:06:46,583
I doubt it.

707
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:07,104
You're smart.

708
01:07:09,402 --> 01:07:11,442
Farmers ain't smart.

709
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:15,106
I don't know exactly where you came
from or what you were doing,

710
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:21,326
but I think you ought to go back to it,
because you can't farm worth spit.

711
01:07:25,293 --> 01:07:28,958
Unless... unless you lost your nerve.

712
01:07:29,964 --> 01:07:34,710
In that case, cabbages
is just what the doctor ordered.

713
01:07:41,893 --> 01:07:45,226
Is your nerve gone?

714
01:07:45,355 --> 01:07:47,810
Is your nerve gone?

715
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:53,442
Yah!

716
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,030
Easy, easy!

717
01:08:02,372 --> 01:08:06,072
We're home, boys. We'll bed down soon.

718
01:08:06,209 --> 01:08:08,878
How we gonna get 'em
to swim across the Mighty Mo?

719
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:11,921
If you can get one or two to go,
they'll all go.

720
01:08:12,048 --> 01:08:15,132
Here's the breaks. Come on!

721
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,011
Back in the USA! What a relief.

722
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:23,553
Hey!

723
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:26,225
Slow, boys.

724
01:08:30,692 --> 01:08:32,150
Mounties!

725
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:36,775
Come on. Let's get outta here.

726
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:38,780
Get down.

727
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,034
Let's get outta here.

728
01:08:44,831 --> 01:08:46,870
Come on! Yah! Yah!

729
01:08:54,966 --> 01:08:56,626
Agh!

730
01:09:02,932 --> 01:09:04,972
Let's go! Let's go!

731
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:41,508
Wonder where Little Tod
got himself off to.

732
01:09:43,056 --> 01:09:45,095
I don't know.

733
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:49,512
I don't know where my finger is either.

734
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:56,059
Them Mounties... followed us
right into the United States of America,

735
01:09:56,194 --> 01:09:58,233
got their horses back.

736
01:09:59,447 --> 01:10:01,855
It's not even legal!

737
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:09,363
Tie that hand up and let's move. Maybe
we'll meet Little Tod at the Snake's Cross.

738
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:36,332
Come on.

739
01:11:36,461 --> 01:11:38,500
Come on. Go! Go!

740
01:12:37,313 --> 01:12:39,187
Whoa, there.

741
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:48,113
Do you always get off
your horse that way?

742
01:12:50,243 --> 01:12:53,030
I'm not chasin' you.

743
01:12:53,162 --> 01:12:57,575
- Who did you think was after you?
- This is the haunt of thieves and killers.

744
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,950
Oh, shit. Here.

745
01:13:00,753 --> 01:13:06,838
This ain't the haunt of nothin' but
diamondbacks and old farts like me.

746
01:13:07,802 --> 01:13:11,550
- Who are ya?
- My name's Jim Ferguson.

747
01:13:12,557 --> 01:13:15,178
I'm pleased to meet you.
What's your name?

748
01:13:15,309 --> 01:13:17,266
Tod La Frambois.

749
01:13:17,395 --> 01:13:19,434
La Frambois.

750
01:13:20,815 --> 01:13:24,433
- What's your trade, Mr La Frambois?
- Trade?

751
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:28,946
Well, I been in the...
farm implement business.

752
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:34,412
Now I'm lookin' to get on with the ranch.
Maybe down around Absaroka.

753
01:13:35,121 --> 01:13:37,576
That'd be over that way.

754
01:13:43,462 --> 01:13:47,875
I tell you what. I got a nice hare
on a stick over here.

755
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:52,050
Let's go have a bite to eat.

756
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:54,849
- Well... thank you.
- Come on.

757
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:11,821
* Life is like a mountain railway

758
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:18,827
* With an engineer that's brave

759
01:14:19,749 --> 01:14:26,368
* We must make this run successful

760
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:33,552
* From the cradle to the grave

761
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:40,429
* Heed the curves, the fills, the tunnels

762
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:45,804
* Never falter, never quail

763
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:47,815
Never quail.

764
01:14:47,943 --> 01:14:54,112
* Keep your hand upon the throttle

765
01:14:54,241 --> 01:15:00,695
* And your eye upon the rail

766
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:05,075
- Sweet song.
- Yeah.

767
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:12,795
Do you believe that life is like
a mountain railroad, Mr La Frambois?

768
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:17,221
All I know, Jim, is that...

769
01:15:17,348 --> 01:15:20,799
life is not like anything I ever seen before.

770
01:15:22,728 --> 01:15:24,768
Yes.

771
01:15:26,816 --> 01:15:32,106
It's really strange runnin' into a preacher
out here, in this hellhole.

772
01:15:32,822 --> 01:15:37,365
I believe that life is
like a mountain railway,

773
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:40,944
but not for the reasons in the song.

774
01:15:41,789 --> 01:15:44,197
I think life is like a mountain railway

775
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:49,838
cos you don't have no idea what sleazy
son of a bitch got his hand on the throttle.

776
01:15:49,964 --> 01:15:53,796
That's a real strange attitude
for a preacher.

777
01:15:58,055 --> 01:16:00,546
Yep.

778
01:16:00,683 --> 01:16:03,138
I ain't no preacher.

779
01:16:08,983 --> 01:16:10,774
What do you do?

780
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:14,816
I'm about a quarter-ass horse thief.

781
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:18,398
Anything to get some grits in my stomach.

782
01:16:18,534 --> 01:16:21,286
Not doin' too good at it neither.

783
01:16:21,412 --> 01:16:24,781
Otherwise I wouldn't be eatin' hare.

784
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:27,371
I'd be in Dodge City,

785
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:31,333
playin' with them big asses,
drinkin' champagne.

786
01:16:34,008 --> 01:16:37,543
What about yourself there, Tod?

787
01:16:37,678 --> 01:16:39,671
What do you do?

788
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:45,844
Well, there's really nothin' to say.
I'm a single man. Implement business.

789
01:16:48,314 --> 01:16:52,181
- Where you got this implement business?
- It's in Big Sandy.

790
01:16:52,318 --> 01:16:54,891
No, I mean the Shonkin Sag.

791
01:16:55,029 --> 01:16:57,780
No, I mean Big Sandy. Big...

792
01:17:01,035 --> 01:17:03,870
I was raised up in Big Sandy.

793
01:17:03,996 --> 01:17:08,325
There ain't a teeny-weeny
implement business in Big Sandy,

794
01:17:08,459 --> 01:17:11,128
and not in Shonkin Sag neither.

795
01:17:13,464 --> 01:17:18,541
Mr Ferguson, I'm really grateful to you
for your hospitality and everything,

796
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:21,797
but my line of work is
none of your damn business.

797
01:17:21,931 --> 01:17:26,509
I'm sorry, Tod. I didn't mean
to get you all riled up like that.

798
01:17:26,644 --> 01:17:29,016
I'll tell you what.

799
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:34,057
Maybe one of these days, I'll get
a chance to cook your supper for you.

800
01:17:34,193 --> 01:17:37,776
Hah! Hooray for a free dang meal.

801
01:17:39,949 --> 01:17:41,229
Good.

802
01:17:41,367 --> 01:17:43,406
Thank God.

803
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:51,704
I hope you keep my business
to yourself too.

804
01:17:51,836 --> 01:17:54,124
Hey. You got my word.

805
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,668
That's good enough.

806
01:18:43,596 --> 01:18:46,965
What the hell's goin' on here?

807
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:50,848
Goddamn. What the hell's
the matter with you?

808
01:18:50,978 --> 01:18:54,311
Something... I don't know...

809
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,227
Tryin' to get some sleep here.

810
01:19:09,121 --> 01:19:12,490
I want you to cinch up good
on the knot there.

811
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:15,661
- Yeah, I did.
- All right, now don't have fear.

812
01:19:15,794 --> 01:19:18,665
This is the way my daddy taught me, now.

813
01:19:21,133 --> 01:19:24,169
Easy aces, now. Come on.

814
01:19:24,303 --> 01:19:26,545
Come on.

815
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:33,098
- This is the part I hate. I can't swim a lick.
- Come on.

816
01:19:33,229 --> 01:19:35,268
- What do I do?
- Now slide off.

817
01:19:35,397 --> 01:19:39,098
Slide off. Let her go.
Let the horse go. Don't hold on.

818
01:19:39,235 --> 01:19:42,070
- That's it. Now we're doin' it.
- Whoo-hoo!

819
01:19:42,196 --> 01:19:44,865
I got you now.

820
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,030
Damn!

821
01:19:48,243 --> 01:19:51,612
- Hell, this is easy.
- Up on that beast now.

822
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,449
You're halfway to the barn now, laddie.

823
01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:58,122
- Halfway.
- Yee-hah!

824
01:19:58,254 --> 01:20:01,622
Come on! We've cut that son of a bitch.

825
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:06,927
We cut that goddamn thing
slicker than butter.

826
01:20:07,054 --> 01:20:10,423
Listen, you go on ahead now.

827
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:13,511
You go on over there
and I'll secure the rope here.

828
01:20:13,644 --> 01:20:15,933
- You got a good hold on that?
- Yeah.

829
01:20:16,063 --> 01:20:21,567
You get goin' now, and then you pull me
in case something happens to me.

830
01:20:21,694 --> 01:20:23,733
Yah!

831
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:26,529
Let her go now.

832
01:20:27,032 --> 01:20:29,072
I don't know about this.

833
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:34,111
That's it. Go ahead.

834
01:20:34,248 --> 01:20:35,327
In you go.

835
01:20:35,457 --> 01:20:38,079
Damn horse won't swim. Come on.

836
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,997
- Dig your heels in now.
- This isn't bad at all.

837
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,244
Yah!

838
01:20:43,132 --> 01:20:45,124
I can't swim. Bring me in.

839
01:20:45,259 --> 01:20:48,176
Now, you dirt turkey,
are you gonna talk to me?

840
01:20:48,304 --> 01:20:51,091
You gonna tell me somethin' now?

841
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:56,051
Listen, son, you got two choices now.
Drink this muddy son of a bitch,

842
01:20:56,186 --> 01:20:59,140
or tell me about Tom Logan
and your goddamn rustlin'.

843
01:20:59,273 --> 01:21:01,680
You... You son...

844
01:21:01,817 --> 01:21:05,186
- I'm gonna give you one...
- I'm not gonna say anything.

845
01:21:05,321 --> 01:21:07,776
Mr La Frambois, one.

846
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:11,655
Agh!

847
01:21:22,212 --> 01:21:24,454
Adios, amigo.

848
01:22:03,253 --> 01:22:05,329
That's Little Tod's horse.

849
01:22:05,464 --> 01:22:07,706
Damned if it ain't.

850
01:22:12,596 --> 01:22:15,799
What happened?
Did he get bucked off or what?

851
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,640
- I don't know.
- Cal?

852
01:22:22,314 --> 01:22:25,481
- What is it?
- What the hell's goin' on?

853
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:27,815
Let's get inside.

854
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:35,404
- What's happening?
- Lee Clayton. Lee Clayton!

855
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:43,452
Come here, Sandy, old girl.
We're goin' to a picnic.

856
01:22:50,843 --> 01:22:52,634
He never will close that gate.

857
01:22:52,761 --> 01:22:56,344
It wasn't near as gloomy around here
when we only had rustlers.

858
01:22:56,473 --> 01:23:00,637
Never seen nothin' like him. Come on.

859
01:23:00,769 --> 01:23:04,767
Never thought Mr Braxton
would call in a man like that.

860
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:18,033
I presume you've had an enlightening trip.

861
01:23:18,162 --> 01:23:19,905
Mm...

862
01:23:21,331 --> 01:23:24,617
Well, what kind of trip did you have?

863
01:23:27,754 --> 01:23:30,292
What did you learn?

864
01:23:30,424 --> 01:23:36,260
Lower your voice. I feel an attack of gas
and that could be perilous to both of us.

865
01:23:36,388 --> 01:23:38,630
That's good.

866
01:23:42,853 --> 01:23:45,344
What did you learn?

867
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:52,812
The one man that could have told me
something didn't tell me nothing,

868
01:23:52,946 --> 01:23:56,778
and then he upped and drowned himself
in the Missouri River.

869
01:23:58,577 --> 01:24:01,068
You've got no further
than we did without you.

870
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:05,154
Oh, I can track a bluebottle fly
right up your nose.

871
01:24:05,292 --> 01:24:09,159
And I've taken to trackin'
what people are thinkin'.

872
01:24:09,296 --> 01:24:11,621
Where's your wife?

873
01:24:11,757 --> 01:24:14,426
What has that got to... Damn it!

874
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:17,924
I detest your impertinence.

875
01:24:18,055 --> 01:24:22,681
You stay out of my private life,
you lilac-smellin' son of a bitch.

876
01:24:24,603 --> 01:24:28,221
You ain't the first mental wizard
I ever met, you know.

877
01:24:28,357 --> 01:24:31,891
I've met ranchers, outlaws,
stock detectives

878
01:24:32,027 --> 01:24:35,894
who thought they was
mental wizards like yourself.

879
01:24:36,031 --> 01:24:40,242
There was one thing I could
never understand and that was...

880
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:43,654
"Why can't they hang on to their women?"

881
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:47,621
You're beginning to rave.
And you're beginning to bore me.

882
01:24:47,751 --> 01:24:49,827
So you're gonna stop.

883
01:24:49,962 --> 01:24:52,916
You're gonna stop spying on me
and on my family.

884
01:24:53,048 --> 01:24:55,337
You were never hired to do that.

885
01:24:55,467 --> 01:24:57,875
I do not, and Jane does not,

886
01:24:58,011 --> 01:25:01,843
and the dozen dolts who work for me
do not steal horses.

887
01:25:03,976 --> 01:25:07,012
But somebody does, don't he?

888
01:25:29,418 --> 01:25:32,869
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.

889
01:25:33,964 --> 01:25:35,873
- Cal!
- Long time, Logan.

890
01:25:36,008 --> 01:25:40,088
Cal, I want you to meet
a good friend of mine. Jane Braxton.

891
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,506
- How do?
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

892
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,974
She was born and bred here, Cal,
and ready for city lights.

893
01:25:47,102 --> 01:25:50,436
Pretty ladies should have what they want.

894
01:25:50,564 --> 01:25:53,849
- How's the ranch comin', Tom?
- You want a tour?

895
01:25:55,402 --> 01:25:57,893
Sure do.

896
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:00,485
I'll see you later. Bye.

897
01:26:11,126 --> 01:26:14,744
Cal, come on, I'll show you the orchard.
Come on, buddy.

898
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,580
This little bastard was
in sorry shape before I got to it.

899
01:26:18,717 --> 01:26:23,462
These trees wouldn't have turned out
a peck of apples apiece.

900
01:26:23,597 --> 01:26:28,175
No wonder that guy's makin' barrels in
town. He wasn't running this place right.

901
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:31,227
This tree was all full of scale and blight.

902
01:26:31,355 --> 01:26:37,724
These limbs I dug out of here had borers
in 'em and insect eggs all over everything.

903
01:26:37,861 --> 01:26:39,688
It was...

904
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:44,868
Little Tod didn't come home.

905
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:54,874
What the hell are you doin'?

906
01:26:55,003 --> 01:27:01,088
What difference does it make whether
blight or borers eat up this whole ranch?

907
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:06,139
Well, Cal, I just have to say it.

908
01:27:08,392 --> 01:27:11,677
I'd prefer that they didn't ruin the orchard.

909
01:27:23,865 --> 01:27:26,321
Poor Little Tod.

910
01:27:44,052 --> 01:27:46,887
Gimme that cartridge.

911
01:27:51,059 --> 01:27:55,271
That girl's old man
hired Lee Clayton, didn't he?

912
01:27:57,441 --> 01:28:00,228
Yeah. He did.

913
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,895
What about her? Where's her husband at?

914
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:07,530
She don't have a husband.
She don't need one.

915
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:10,411
She don't need one.

916
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:14,072
Boy, you're pretty far gone, ain't ya?

917
01:28:14,207 --> 01:28:19,581
- It's the way it happens, isn't it, Cal?
- I wouldn't know.

918
01:28:19,713 --> 01:28:23,461
Not since that dog of mine
put his tongue on the butter.

919
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:47,278
Where's Lee Clayton? Is he here?

920
01:28:47,407 --> 01:28:51,736
You betcha. Moved right in.
Made himself at home. Boy!

921
01:28:54,748 --> 01:28:56,787
Robert Lee?

922
01:29:21,441 --> 01:29:23,683
Robert Lee.

923
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:33,406
You know, the old man built this tub
for the old lady, and she ran out on him.

924
01:29:33,537 --> 01:29:36,703
Wasn't that you callin' me out there?

925
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:39,369
Yes, son. That was me.

926
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:42,288
There's no way you can win, you know.

927
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,452
What?

928
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:45,415
- There's no way you can win.
- Win?

929
01:29:45,549 --> 01:29:49,249
It's kin of mine is all
that calls me Robert Lee.

930
01:29:49,386 --> 01:29:51,711
I'm going to bust your fat ass.

931
01:29:53,598 --> 01:29:57,976
How am I to get my nourishment
spending my dinner hour here with you?

932
01:29:58,103 --> 01:30:03,144
You ain't gonna get no nourishment.
You're gonna dry up and blow away.

933
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:10,991
It just ain't in the cards, angel.

934
01:30:11,116 --> 01:30:14,615
Can't you see that the list
is as long as my arm?

935
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:17,235
You're under the headin'
of what I do for a livin'.

936
01:30:17,372 --> 01:30:21,666
Now step outside, because
my stomach has commenced to growl.

937
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,459
Are you scared?

938
01:30:27,507 --> 01:30:29,749
Shakin' all over.

939
01:30:29,885 --> 01:30:33,170
It's almost like I don't have a prayer.

940
01:30:34,222 --> 01:30:36,760
But I can't lose this appetite.
What ails me?

941
01:30:36,892 --> 01:30:41,684
You're floatin' there in your confirmation
dress waitin' for God to save ya.

942
01:30:41,813 --> 01:30:45,858
Did it ever bother you, sittin' up there
in that cabin drinkin' coffee,

943
01:30:45,984 --> 01:30:50,527
while that fiddler's wife
was screamin' in the Sandwash?

944
01:30:52,407 --> 01:30:56,487
Well, first off... I don't drink coffee.

945
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:59,620
Now can I climb out?
I'm hungry for my supper.

946
01:30:59,748 --> 01:31:02,998
Where's your Creedmore at, Robert Lee?

947
01:31:03,126 --> 01:31:07,254
Where's your cabbage-shootin' Mexican
pistola with flowers on the handle?

948
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,215
Why don't you go get it?

949
01:31:11,301 --> 01:31:13,839
That settles it.

950
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:15,844
I'm not that hungry

951
01:31:15,972 --> 01:31:20,883
and I'll stay here till someone fetches me
who cares about my welfare.

952
01:31:21,019 --> 01:31:24,637
- I deplore...
- Get up, you dry-gulchin' piece of slime.

953
01:31:24,773 --> 01:31:26,896
A little bathe in the tub here...

954
01:31:27,025 --> 01:31:28,649
Get up!

955
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:31,061
Get up!

956
01:31:31,196 --> 01:31:35,407
I want to lie here and lose.
No dinner. No nothing.

957
01:31:41,373 --> 01:31:42,950
Well?

958
01:32:08,483 --> 01:32:10,855
My God. You ain't even there.

959
01:32:37,387 --> 01:32:39,426
Did you kill him?

960
01:32:39,556 --> 01:32:45,926
No, I just emptied his tub. Somebody's
gonna have to do something about that.

961
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:06,537
What's become of Tom?

962
01:33:08,376 --> 01:33:11,413
- Isn't he on his place?
- No, he's not.

963
01:33:11,546 --> 01:33:16,172
Well, that's not what I call ranching.
I know what you're driving at.

964
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:20,298
All I can tell you is that things have
been nearly as bad as they could be.

965
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:24,475
If those two men have reason to look
for one another, I'm not interfering.

966
01:33:24,601 --> 01:33:27,092
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him.

967
01:33:27,228 --> 01:33:28,806
No.

968
01:33:28,938 --> 01:33:31,429
You can't.

969
01:33:31,566 --> 01:33:33,523
I won't.

970
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:37,439
I hope that you choke on that.

971
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:43,035
You don't mean that, darling.

972
01:33:44,204 --> 01:33:46,445
- Vern, scat.
- You betcha.

973
01:33:47,832 --> 01:33:51,035
I wouldn't have hired Lee
if the rustlers hadn't killed Pete.

974
01:33:51,169 --> 01:33:54,289
This has nothing to do with Pete,
law, or stealing horses.

975
01:33:54,422 --> 01:33:57,542
- Then what does it have to do with?
- Tom Logan.

976
01:33:57,675 --> 01:34:00,001
Tom Logan.

977
01:34:01,137 --> 01:34:06,095
- I never even think about him.
- You can't bear me being with him.

978
01:34:06,226 --> 01:34:11,766
Now, Daddy, goddamn it.
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him!

979
01:34:11,898 --> 01:34:16,476
You think I couldn't bear living here alone,
don't you? Start me thinking.

980
01:34:16,611 --> 01:34:18,651
No... No.

981
01:34:20,031 --> 01:34:22,652
No, I won't. I won't.

982
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:29,496
Whoa, Buck.

983
01:34:29,624 --> 01:34:32,329
- Oh...
- What the hell are you doin'?

984
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:37,834
- Cal's got me lookin' out for Lee Clayton.
- Come on down. Old Buck come up lame.

985
01:34:37,966 --> 01:34:42,177
Gimme a hand. Goddamn it.
Easy, Buck. Come on now.

986
01:34:43,012 --> 01:34:47,057
Only goddamn intelligent horse.
Easy, boy.

987
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,599
I had him.

988
01:34:56,276 --> 01:35:01,981
You think anybody could do it?
I mean... an ordinary fella?

989
01:35:05,869 --> 01:35:07,908
I don't know.

990
01:35:10,165 --> 01:35:15,123
Seems like somebody oughta
be able to get the job done.

991
01:35:15,253 --> 01:35:17,708
Just watch it is all.

992
01:35:20,717 --> 01:35:23,468
I'll tell you one thing, though.

993
01:35:24,554 --> 01:35:26,593
Don't start talkin' to him.

994
01:35:26,723 --> 01:35:30,092
I don't care what the plan is,
as long as you get us outta here.

995
01:35:30,226 --> 01:35:34,935
That's what I'd like.
Let's just pull our socks up and get out.

996
01:35:35,064 --> 01:35:37,816
We're gonna hit Braxton.

997
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:42,320
We're gonna take everything he's got.
Blooded stock an' all.

998
01:35:42,447 --> 01:35:46,065
- That's the least we can do.
- And maybe flush us a regulator.

999
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:49,118
I would love to include the old man.

1000
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:51,950
A.44-40 in the brain
would be my sentence for him.

1001
01:35:52,081 --> 01:35:54,916
I don't know why you don't want
to go along with that.

1002
01:35:55,043 --> 01:35:56,453
I'd just sooner we didn't.

1003
01:35:56,586 --> 01:36:00,204
I wanna know on what grounds
you don't wanna shoot Braxton!

1004
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:03,839
We ain't gonna do it
because I said we ain't gonna do it!

1005
01:36:05,803 --> 01:36:08,010
Am I perfectly clear on that, Cal?

1006
01:36:08,139 --> 01:36:10,808
Goddamn it, let's not start that stuff.

1007
01:36:10,934 --> 01:36:14,552
Really, Tom, it's only
gonna wreck the whole job.

1008
01:36:14,687 --> 01:36:16,727
Cal?

1009
01:36:29,661 --> 01:36:33,195
Hey, Woodruff.
Braxton got you nighthawking.

1010
01:36:33,331 --> 01:36:35,786
Mr Logan, what you doin'
out of bed at this hour?

1011
01:36:35,917 --> 01:36:40,543
Lookin' for a better life, Woodruff. What
do you know that's new and exciting?

1012
01:36:40,672 --> 01:36:44,800
- Same old thing.
- What do you got in here?

1013
01:36:44,926 --> 01:36:47,251
Oh...

1014
01:36:47,387 --> 01:36:48,549
37.

1015
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,764
And I got the walkin' horse, but...

1016
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:55,970
You're gonna take 'em.

1017
01:36:56,104 --> 01:36:59,473
You bet. You wanna get down now?

1018
01:36:59,607 --> 01:37:04,732
And reach me over that bird's head Colt
you got stuck in your shirt there.

1019
01:37:04,862 --> 01:37:08,029
Butt first, if you please, Woodruff.

1020
01:37:26,759 --> 01:37:32,133
- You think you're smart, don't you?
- Well, I ain't dumb and I ain't tied up.

1021
01:37:33,224 --> 01:37:35,430
You just lay on that soft spot.

1022
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:39,260
- You're slicker than snot on a door knob.
- Thank you, Cary.

1023
01:37:44,402 --> 01:37:46,441
I tell you one goddamn thing.

1024
01:37:46,571 --> 01:37:52,443
Old Braxton's gonna be one
surprised-assed son of a bitch, ain't he?

1025
01:37:53,911 --> 01:37:59,416
I regret Pete Marker wasn't here
to get the news, that sorry bag of shit.

1026
01:37:59,542 --> 01:38:03,077
We'll see him in hell, that son of a bitch.

1027
01:38:03,212 --> 01:38:07,424
Shut up, Si, or you'll push these horses
all the way down to Kansas without us.

1028
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:11,133
Let's push, boys. I feel eyes all over us.

1029
01:38:32,241 --> 01:38:36,654
That relay ranch is dead.
Anybody got a preferred district?

1030
01:38:36,788 --> 01:38:39,029
- Hellsgate for me.
- Big Hole.

1031
01:38:39,165 --> 01:38:42,119
Big Hole. I'll meet you there. Cal?

1032
01:38:43,169 --> 01:38:45,742
Dodge Pole. Shit, that's all that's left.

1033
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,916
- We'll meet back at the old cabin. Cary?
- All right.

1034
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:53,463
Remember, I wanna get $20 a head
for these or we're doing this job...

1035
01:39:08,069 --> 01:39:12,530
I could have picked off one or two of them
maybe, but we'd have lost the rest.

1036
01:39:12,657 --> 01:39:18,362
Supposin' you had a barn full of nasty
old bats. You wanted to get rid of them.

1037
01:39:18,496 --> 01:39:23,372
The worst thing you could do is just
get your gun and start shootin' around.

1038
01:39:23,501 --> 01:39:25,707
What good would it do you?

1039
01:39:25,837 --> 01:39:29,040
They'd leave and they'd be back
by 7.30 in the morning.

1040
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:33,385
If you want to get rid of a whole lot
of evil bats, there's only one way.

1041
01:39:33,511 --> 01:39:37,509
And the way is this.
You wait till the dawn comes.

1042
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:41,223
About 4.30 and you're waitin'
outside by the barrels.

1043
01:39:41,352 --> 01:39:46,014
Then you close the door real quick
and all the bats are inside.

1044
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:49,767
Then while they're sleepin',
the lovely little sweethearts,

1045
01:39:49,902 --> 01:39:53,354
you have every one of the dirty
little buggers at your mercy.

1046
01:39:53,489 --> 01:39:58,235
- That's the only way you can do it.
- That's all very informative.

1047
01:39:58,369 --> 01:40:00,825
But every horse I own is gone.

1048
01:40:00,955 --> 01:40:04,620
The only way you're going
to get paid is if I get them back.

1049
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,241
Golly.

1050
01:40:07,378 --> 01:40:09,999
I don't care a damn about that. Come on.

1051
01:40:10,131 --> 01:40:12,170
Always finish the work.

1052
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:17,092
And... I don't give a damn
whether or not I get paid.

1053
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:23,306
And, uh... talkin' about horses, I think
I know the horse you're worrying about.

1054
01:40:23,436 --> 01:40:26,437
- He wears a black hat, he's two-legged...
- Shut up.

1055
01:40:26,564 --> 01:40:28,972
.. and I think I know
where he stands at stud.

1056
01:40:29,108 --> 01:40:31,860
Shut up! You're out of control.
You're through.

1057
01:40:31,986 --> 01:40:34,311
I want you off the place. Now get!

1058
01:40:34,447 --> 01:40:37,448
Well, it is your place, sir.

1059
01:40:37,575 --> 01:40:42,284
But the work is mine
and I'll have the say about that.

1060
01:40:43,789 --> 01:40:46,411
Come on, Jess.
We know when we're not wanted.

1061
01:40:46,542 --> 01:40:49,709
Let's go out to the bat hunt now.

1062
01:40:49,837 --> 01:40:55,377
You lazy no-good bastards, get back
to work or I'll fire every one of you!

1063
01:41:12,902 --> 01:41:15,856
They call this country Hellsgate.

1064
01:41:17,949 --> 01:41:23,026
When my dad came in here, it was
nothing but a bunch of savage Indians...

1065
01:41:23,162 --> 01:41:25,202
and Jesuits.

1066
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:33,378
Old Thomas Jefferson said that he was
a warrior so his son could be a farmer,

1067
01:41:33,506 --> 01:41:36,175
so his son could be a poet.

1068
01:41:39,637 --> 01:41:43,765
I raise cattle
so my son can be a merchant,

1069
01:41:43,891 --> 01:41:46,892
so his son can move to Newport,
Rhode Island, buy a sailboat

1070
01:41:47,019 --> 01:41:53,223
and never see one of these bastard-assed
son-of-a-bitchin' mountains again.

1071
01:41:56,279 --> 01:41:58,734
Who was Thomas Jefferson?

1072
01:42:01,867 --> 01:42:04,537
Guy back east.

1073
01:42:07,915 --> 01:42:11,082
I'll bet you're about done in.
You had a long day.

1074
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:13,037
That's true.

1075
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:15,708
Mother, you wanna show
our boy the bunkhouse?

1076
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:19,624
Surely. I'll bring him a blanket.

1077
01:42:21,387 --> 01:42:24,139
I'll see you before
you start out in the morning.

1078
01:42:24,265 --> 01:42:26,471
Fine.

1079
01:42:26,601 --> 01:42:29,685
Let me thank you again
for selling me those horses.

1080
01:42:29,812 --> 01:42:31,852
It's my pleasure.

1081
01:42:32,898 --> 01:42:36,433
My compliments to the artist
that changed those brands.

1082
01:42:36,569 --> 01:42:38,858
Was it you?

1083
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:44,867
I learned it from a nice boy from
Newport, Rhode Island, with no sailboat.

1084
01:42:44,994 --> 01:42:50,450
They hung him in a cottonwood south of
the Shonkin Sag, by the neck, until dead.

1085
01:43:01,844 --> 01:43:04,715
- You've got five minutes.
- OK. Sh.

1086
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:10,967
Wait. It would help if you got
out of your drawers altogether.

1087
01:43:11,103 --> 01:43:13,012
- No.
- Sh.

1088
01:43:13,147 --> 01:43:17,856
- What good is it keepin' them on one leg?
- Why don't you shut up?

1089
01:43:18,944 --> 01:43:22,527
You've only got four of your minutes left.

1090
01:43:25,284 --> 01:43:28,570
Besides, I'm beginning to chafe.

1091
01:43:30,956 --> 01:43:32,783
Agh!

1092
01:43:37,713 --> 01:43:41,581
Hon? Honey?

1093
01:44:15,418 --> 01:44:17,991
Kid. Hey, kid.

1094
01:44:18,129 --> 01:44:21,165
Here's a buck. Go get me a whiskey
and the rest is yours.

1095
01:44:21,298 --> 01:44:24,833
Good stuff. Go on. Hurry up.

1096
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:30,137
Hurry up.

1097
01:44:34,645 --> 01:44:37,053
Thanks.

1098
01:45:01,672 --> 01:45:03,712
Hold these, junior.

1099
01:45:05,718 --> 01:45:09,087
I won't be but a minute,
then we'll go get something to eat.

1100
01:45:19,231 --> 01:45:21,271
Hey!

1101
01:45:24,862 --> 01:45:27,816
Hey! Hey!

1102
01:45:32,578 --> 01:45:34,202
Hey!

1103
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,457
Hey! Hey!

1104
01:45:52,807 --> 01:45:55,677
I ain't got but $54, mister.

1105
01:45:55,809 --> 01:45:59,095
But I want all three horses or nothing.

1106
01:46:01,106 --> 01:46:03,348
What you got to trade?

1107
01:46:05,152 --> 01:46:07,192
A clarinet.

1108
01:46:13,327 --> 01:46:16,162
All right, I'll take it.

1109
01:47:35,868 --> 01:47:38,738
I can't use it. It looks too tight.

1110
01:47:43,626 --> 01:47:46,792
Here. Let me try it on.

1111
01:47:48,297 --> 01:47:51,880
Put your arm in. You can't tell till it's on.

1112
01:47:52,009 --> 01:47:54,547
Oh, it fits...

1113
01:47:55,179 --> 01:47:57,848
I don't want the goddamn thing.

1114
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:03,910
Smoked meat!

1115
01:49:23,183 --> 01:49:25,805
Old smoked meat.

1116
01:49:33,235 --> 01:49:35,691
Where's Tom Logan?

1117
01:49:43,787 --> 01:49:46,954
I couldn't get him to come out.

1118
01:49:47,082 --> 01:49:49,122
God!

1119
01:49:52,838 --> 01:49:55,625
Too proud, huh?

1120
01:49:56,592 --> 01:49:58,631
I reckon.

1121
01:50:08,687 --> 01:50:12,305
I'd like about anything
but getting burned up.

1122
01:50:26,455 --> 01:50:30,666
Well, you're about
the last of your kind, old man.

1123
01:50:33,045 --> 01:50:36,330
If I was a better businessman
than I am a manhunter,

1124
01:50:36,465 --> 01:50:39,134
I'd put you in the circus.

1125
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:54,351
You know, about this time of year -
Indian summer - gettin' there...

1126
01:50:54,483 --> 01:50:57,733
they say you can see
the Star of Bethlehem,

1127
01:50:57,861 --> 01:51:00,566
if you look real good.

1128
01:51:00,697 --> 01:51:06,451
I seen it once or twice. But you gotta look
away and then you gotta look at it, see?

1129
01:51:06,578 --> 01:51:10,410
You gotta look at it
just a minute, like that, see?

1130
01:51:12,876 --> 01:51:15,367
See what I mean?

1131
01:51:38,902 --> 01:51:43,232
Well, old Granny's gettin' tired now.

1132
01:52:51,183 --> 01:52:53,222
Cal?

1133
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:59,979
Si?

1134
01:53:14,289 --> 01:53:17,041
Oh... Oh...

1135
01:53:19,586 --> 01:53:21,958
Oh, my God.

1136
01:54:18,895 --> 01:54:20,935
No. Kiss first.

1137
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:24,188
Kiss first.

1138
01:54:29,364 --> 01:54:32,116
You have the lips of Salome,

1139
01:54:32,242 --> 01:54:34,698
and the eyes of Cleopatra.

1140
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:52,382
I dedicate this song
to the only woman I ever loved.

1141
01:54:55,766 --> 01:54:59,810
I'm too shy to turn around
and say it to your face,

1142
01:54:59,936 --> 01:55:03,021
but I mean it from my heart.

1143
01:55:03,148 --> 01:55:05,437
I don't love you, you harlot.

1144
01:55:05,567 --> 01:55:09,481
I'm not even speaking to you.
Do you know that?

1145
01:55:12,616 --> 01:55:15,321
Come on. Would you?

1146
01:55:17,662 --> 01:55:22,289
That for you, and your disloyalty
and your treachery.

1147
01:55:23,668 --> 01:55:25,708
Dear heart.

1148
01:55:40,268 --> 01:55:43,602
Grandma... Grandma.

1149
01:55:47,484 --> 01:55:50,769
Say good night to Granny.

1150
01:55:50,904 --> 01:55:53,656
I'll play you a tune.

1151
01:56:10,799 --> 01:56:14,417
Well, that's a fine thing.

1152
01:56:14,553 --> 01:56:19,049
You've pissed right in the middle
of my love song.

1153
01:56:20,308 --> 01:56:22,930
God! Pissin' over my song.

1154
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:43,619
Well...

1155
01:57:13,445 --> 01:57:16,315
You know what woke you up?

1156
01:57:18,408 --> 01:57:21,575
Lee, you just had your throat cut.

1157
01:58:00,617 --> 01:58:02,906
Where is he?

1158
01:58:21,346 --> 01:58:24,217
He's in there.

1159
01:58:37,445 --> 01:58:41,490
All the rest of the hands left
a couple of days ago except for Vern.

1160
01:58:41,616 --> 01:58:45,863
- I'm stayin'. You betcha.
- It's all right, Vern.

1161
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:55,625
I told him I was leaving last night
and he... sort of came unravelled.

1162
01:58:55,755 --> 01:58:58,922
He's just lost himself.

1163
01:59:00,927 --> 01:59:03,964
Well, all I can say is
he'd better leave the room,

1164
01:59:04,097 --> 01:59:07,014
cos I'm gonna do it regardless.

1165
01:59:07,142 --> 01:59:10,427
Get out of the way, Vern.
You recognise this?

1166
01:59:12,147 --> 01:59:15,895
- You recognise it?
- No. No.

1167
01:59:16,026 --> 01:59:18,564
Please, don't shoot him.

1168
01:59:18,695 --> 01:59:21,612
What are you caterwauling about, Vern?

1169
01:59:21,740 --> 01:59:23,946
Get out of the way
before I put one into you.

1170
01:59:24,075 --> 01:59:27,242
You might as well. He's all I got. No...

1171
01:59:28,413 --> 01:59:31,497
He's all I have. He's all I have.

1172
01:59:31,624 --> 01:59:34,412
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Shoot me.

1173
01:59:36,046 --> 01:59:38,501
Shoot me. Yes, shoot me.

1174
01:59:40,717 --> 01:59:43,801
- Praise the Lord.
- Get out! Get that son of a bitch away.

1175
01:59:43,928 --> 01:59:48,057
- Vern, will you get away?
- I will. You betcha.

1176
01:59:50,477 --> 01:59:52,718
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- What for?

1177
01:59:53,772 --> 01:59:56,441
For everything.

1178
01:59:59,277 --> 02:00:01,519
Your friends, are they...

1179
02:00:04,407 --> 02:00:06,447
Yeah.

1180
02:00:13,249 --> 02:00:15,289
If...

1181
02:00:18,755 --> 02:00:21,756
What were you gonna do? Just take off?

1182
02:00:21,883 --> 02:00:23,046
Yes.

1183
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:28,805
What'd you expect?

1184
02:00:28,932 --> 02:00:31,055
To see you, for one thing.

1185
02:00:35,647 --> 02:00:38,683
- Did you think I'd be above ground?
- Well, of course.

1186
02:00:38,817 --> 02:00:43,360
- Why "of course"?
- Because I just can't imagine you dead.

1187
02:00:44,406 --> 02:00:47,609
My God, are you gonna make me say it?

1188
02:00:50,912 --> 02:00:52,027
Tom!

1189
02:01:57,187 --> 02:01:59,856
You've just about done it, huh?

1190
02:02:01,107 --> 02:02:03,147
Yeah.

1191
02:02:05,528 --> 02:02:08,944
Well, I think I've found
a buyer for the ranch.

1192
02:02:09,073 --> 02:02:14,863
I'm going into Absaroka now
to see about it and find a place for Vern.

1193
02:02:16,581 --> 02:02:18,205
Well...

1194
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:21,415
I'm glad.

1195
02:02:23,379 --> 02:02:28,421
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
tryin' to get back at somebody.

1196
02:02:29,552 --> 02:02:31,592
Why'd you say that?

1197
02:02:33,264 --> 02:02:35,934
No reason.

1198
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:44,311
Well, hell, neither do I.

1199
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:55,945
Where do you think you'll be...
in about six months?

1200
02:02:57,997 --> 02:03:02,908
Well, if I was to guess,
I'd say north of the breaks.

1201
02:03:03,836 --> 02:03:06,043
There's the Little Rockies up there.

1202
02:03:06,172 --> 02:03:11,415
A lot of little valleys are supposed
to have water year round.

1203
02:03:13,638 --> 02:03:16,592
Sounds like a real good guess.
