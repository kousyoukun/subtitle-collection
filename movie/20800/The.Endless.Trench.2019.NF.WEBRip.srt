Andalusia, 1936

00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,583
raid - incursion, sudden attack,

4
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:15,167
rapid raid party against the enemy
to cause turmoil.

5
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,000
Everyone move now.

6
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,708
Quick! This way.

7
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,375
Come on, get up, quick!

8
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,292
Come on, get up!

9
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,833
Quick now!

10
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,125
What do you want?

11
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,792
There's no one here.

12
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,333
Higinio, quick.

13
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,500
Quick, quick!

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,250
Quick!

15
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,708
- Open now!
- Go find him.

16
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,667
- In the neighbor's house.
- Come on, check that door, too!

17
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,708
Open!

18
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,417
Open up!

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,250
Good morning.

20
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,125
Out of the way. Don't move.

21
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,250
Check the back.

22
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,583
- Can I help?
- Button it.

23
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:16,167
- Check the courtyard too.
- My husband left last night.

24
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:18,417
- There's nobody here.
- Shut up.

25
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,667
- There's nobody.
- See? What I said.

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,625
All right, next ones on the list.

27
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,500
What are you doing?

28
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,833
What are you doing?

29
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:45,917
What is it?

30
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,208
Listen, I need to make a run for it.

31
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,292
They'll ransack everything.

32
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,458
- Where will you go?
- The mountains or somewhere safe.

33
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,833
- Shall I go with you?
- No, I'll come back for you.

34
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:58,292
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

35
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,167
Take this.

36
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,167
What's it for?

37
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,000
So you can wear it. Go on.

38
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,417
Quick! Over here!

39
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,625
Over here!

40
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,708
It's Higinio!

41
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,542
- Stop!
- Stop!

42
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,167
Move it.

43
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,053
These are the last ones
and we're done, huh?

44
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,833
Come on, move it. Get in.

45
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,167
Don't move!

46
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,583
Get a move on, quick!

47
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,958
Come on! Get a move on!

48
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,167
Shut up!

49
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,250
I don't want to hear a word!

50
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,667
Come on! Get a move on, quick!

51
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,167
No talking, huh?

52
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,167
What's going on in there?

53
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,042
Come on, out you come!

54
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:08,250
- Move it.
- Where are you taking them?

55
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,042
- Shut up!
- Leave her!

56
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,500
What are you doing?

57
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,542
Quiet! Nobody move!

58
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,333
- Come on! Move!
- Everyone stay put!

59
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,958
- Quiet!
- Go, go, go!

60
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,208
- What the hell? Sit down.
- Please.

61
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,125
- What the hell are you doing?
- Please.

62
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:09,667
- I'm begging you.
- Go back to your place!

63
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,833
Get off!

64
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,208
One of them got away!
Stop!

65
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,750
Stop, stop, stop!

66
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:27,917
Stop!

67
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,292
Halt!

68
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,542
He ran that way!

69
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,875
Fede, it's Higinio.

70
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,208
Higinio.

71
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,375
You gave us a real fright.

72
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,083
What's going on here?

73
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,583
- What's going on?
- What did you expect?

74
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,083
I could see all this madness coming.

75
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,583
- I could see it.
- What?

76
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,500
How many times did I tell you?
"Bullets won't solve this."

77
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,500
Priests can't be touched.

78
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,333
Landowners can't be touched.

79
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:48,792
Bullets won't solve it.
I told you a thousand times.

80
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,417
I didn't order any killings.

81
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,167
But your people did.
You support them.

82
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,625
Shooting your mouth off about...

83
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,333
having to kill,
and now look what we have.

84
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,875
This is complete madness.

85
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,625
Let's try to be quiet down here.

86
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,208
Fancy a cigarette?

87
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,958
A cigarette, huh?
A cigarette.

88
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,833
Help soothe things a bit.

89
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,417
This is Damián, my cousin.

90
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,125
He arrived last night, escaped a raid
a few days ago in Carmona.

91
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,625
I know you.

92
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,375
I saw you at a meeting
about a year ago.

93
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,417
I was from the support group.

94
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,292
Yeah, your face looks familiar.

95
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,750
You did a lot for us.

96
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,542
Come and fight with us if you want.

97
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,042
What do I do about Rosa?

98
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,542
I have to fetch her.

99
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,292
You're going back to the village?

100
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,583
That's going into the lion's den.

101
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,292
Has she been reported?

102
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,583
Not at all.

103
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,833
Rosa doesn't get into politics,
just me.

104
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,458
She'll be all right, then.

105
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,583
They got married not long ago.

106
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,125
Right.

107
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,167
See what happens?

108
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,125
It's easy to spot a newly-wed.

109
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:22,833
That's what I think.

110
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:47,500
It's enough, right?

111
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,875
Let's go.

112
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,250
Gonzalo!

113
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,042
- Gonzalo.
- What is it?

114
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,708
Come in.

115
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,417
Coming.

116
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,458
Are you staying out all night or what?

117
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,500
Joaquín is coming...

118
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,333
Why are you with these people?

119
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,208
That's my business.

120
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,167
Don't get into trouble.

121
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,833
What trouble do you mean?

122
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,583
All right, have some dinner.

123
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,750
I don't want dinner.

124
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,833
I don't feel hungry.

125
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,375
Dear God, Higinio.

126
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,292
What happened?

127
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,875
We have to go.

128
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,417
What happened?

129
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,417
We have to take
all the money there is.

130
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,542
And head for the mountains...

131
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,958
before it gets light.

132
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,500
What happened to your leg?

133
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,750
What happened?

134
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,500
Don't move.

135
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,042
God, have you seen
the state of your leg?

136
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,750
The bullet is still in there.

137
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:40,625
- Rosa.
- What?

138
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,625
If they catch me, I'm dead.

139
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:47,125
Listen, have you seen
the state of your leg?

140
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:48,500
Where will you go?

141
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,375
- Let's go.
- No, you listen to me.

142
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,542
They're all over the village.

143
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,792
Go to bed.
I'll stay here a while.

144
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,333
Come on.

145
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,208
Higinio,

146
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,375
look at me.

147
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,833
Why did you make that hole?

148
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:23,167
Gonzalo was looking around there
and didn't spot a thing.

149
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,292
Why not get in there,
we can treat your wound,

150
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,375
and then we leave. Okay?

151
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,792
Please.

152
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,542
Come on.

153
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,417
That's the way.

154
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:40,833
Come on.

155
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:06,917
hide - to move somebody or something
to a safe location or place.

156
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,042
- What are you doing?
- Taking them down.

157
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,667
They’ve said that all the curtains have to
come down!

158
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:28,458
No, but... You searched the house,
and now the curtains.

159
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,958
I'll take them down and that's it.

160
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,083
See? Problem solved.

161
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:34,792
Gonzalo, listen to me a minute.

162
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,500
Just a second, stop a minute.
You know...

163
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,042
that maybe Higinio didn't do
everything the right way,

164
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,792
but he never hurt anyone,
he shouldn't be on a list.

165
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,333
You know us.

166
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,083
Well, first he has to turn up,
then we'll see.

167
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:51,083
But I mean that you could say
it was a mistake,

168
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,167
- and take his name off the list.
- A mistake?

169
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,208
He made the mistake when he burnt down
what he shouldn't, huh?

170
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,333
Burnt what?

171
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,708
What?

172
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,542
Barcenillas hermitage,

173
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,042
belongs to the Carmelite nuns,
St. Philip Neri, did he not say?

174
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,450
- That isn't true.
- Didn't he?

175
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,583
- It's not true.
- No?

176
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,167
He may have his ideas,
but he's not violent.

177
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,958
What did he do
when they killed Gonzalo's brother?

178
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,708
He did nothing.

179
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:18,042
Right, he didn't do or say anything,
and he was a councillor.

180
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,250
Isabel, go home.

181
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:21,833
No, no, no.
I want her to know.

182
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,208
Now she's begging, but I want her
to know how alone you felt.

183
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,875
Please, Isabel.

184
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,875
Don't act the innocent, all right?
Don't do it.

185
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,750
We've been locked up afraid
they'd do something if we went out.

186
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,208
And you lot didn't care.

187
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:41,375
If these people hadn't come,
my husband would have been next.

188
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,500
Okay, that's enough.
Stop it.

189
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,875
Just stay out of it.
Go on, go home.

190
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,208
Go home, woman.

191
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,792
Listen to me, Gonzalo.

192
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,667
You know, you know full well,

193
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,458
how sad we are
about your brother.

194
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,750
As soon as we found out,
Higinio himself went to tell you that.

195
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,458
Now do you understand why
I have to do something?

196
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,250
I'm begging you please.

197
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
You should have said that
to your husband.

198
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,542
Begged him.

199
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,042
You should have begged him, right?

200
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,750
Come on, Gonzalo.

201
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:21,375
- Don't take the curtains.
- I'm taking them.

202
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,083
Don't, they're mine.
Give me the curtains!

203
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,333
Hand them over.

204
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,792
They're mine, give them to me!

205
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,958
Don't take the curtains, Gonzalo.

206
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:56,542
"What is it?"
"Searching Remedios's house."

207
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,667
<i>”The blond guy”,</i>

208
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,958
<i>and “the stockade guy” got away.</i>

209
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:43,667
What are you doing there?

210
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,750
What's going on outside?

211
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,667
No, that isn't the point.
What did I say?

212
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,625
Did you talk to anyone?

213
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,417
- Do me a favour and get in there.
- Did you talk to anyone?

214
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,792
Armando has switched sides.

215
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:12,958
The twin, right?

216
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,500
No, Nogales.

217
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,667
Nogales?

218
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,583
Nogales?

219
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,458
I don't trust anyone now.

220
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Gonzalo is giving out
a list of names.

221
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,833
There's nothing worse
than an angry idiot.

222
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:38,042
Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth,
now look at him blabbing.

223
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,458
The trouble with him is
that he's scared.

224
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:45,542
Scared of what?

225
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,750
I don't know.

226
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,500
That we'll come back.

227
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,542
Did you put on the ointment?

228
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,542
I forgot all about the ointment.

229
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,333
Careful, careful.

230
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,208
Does it hurt?

231
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,000
I can put up with it.

232
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,792
God, you really stink.

233
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
- What do you mean I stink?
- This.

234
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,042
What's wrong? It smells of me.

235
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,542
You haven't changed it
since you got in there.

236
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,333
Why would I change shirts?

237
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:31,542
"My back is really hurting."

238
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,708
I can already walk.

239
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,375
Higinio.

240
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:45,417
What?

241
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,708
What was planed for the next week
is going to be impossible.

242
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,375
How can you say that?

243
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,875
They arrested the man
who was going to get us to Portugal.

244
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,375
That can't be, Rosa,
that can't be.

245
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,833
- That can't be.
- It's all right, I'll find a way.

246
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,792
We have to leave now.
We have to risk it.

247
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,625
We can't wait any longer.

248
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,042
Now is the time.

249
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,333
- We must leave now.
- For God's sake.

250
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,583
Take it easy,
I'll find a way.

251
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:39,292
arrest - temporary loss of freedom
by authority of law.

252
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,375
If you don't know anything,
why so nervous?

253
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:42,917
I don't know.

254
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:46,000
What do you expect if you come
to my house this late?

255
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,583
You didn't hear about him,
not even from someone else?

256
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,833
No, I already said I didn't.
He left and that was the last I heard.

257
00:24:56,625 --> 00:25:00,167
Then why are you so desperate
to have him wiped off the list?

258
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,000
Haven't you already had enough?

259
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,000
I don't know anything.

260
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,792
What did you say when he left?

261
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,292
Nothing,
I couldn't even say goodbye.

262
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,083
So how did you know
what time he left?

263
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:13,583
The time, I...

264
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,417
He left in the morning,
but I don't know at what time.

265
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,583
They saw you washing a man's shirt
the other day.

266
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,583
Don't act stupid.

267
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,625
Nothing goes unnoticed here.

268
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,958
Or wasn't it your husband's?

269
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:36,458
Yes, it is...
It was my husband's, but...

270
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,958
I found it a week after he left,
it was dirty so I washed it.

271
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:52,333
Your neighbors say
you always kept the front door open,

272
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,792
and now it's almost always shut.

273
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,667
Just what I needed.

274
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,542
Quit crying.

275
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,958
I said quit crying, okay?

276
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,083
If you don't collaborate now,
we have orders to carry out.

277
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:12,542
You see...
I really don't know anything.

278
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,500
A couple of questions.

279
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,208
No, no, no, more questions?
But I already told you...

280
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,792
- No, please!
- Don't make it more difficult.

281
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,333
Please don't do this!

282
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,583
I don't know anything or where he is.
For God's sake, please don't!

283
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,500
- Come on now.
- I want to stay here!

284
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:30,250
I'm telling you
that I don't know anything!

285
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,500
Please.

286
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,958
Is he not here?

287
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,375
Looks that way.

288
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,708
I tell you, I hear noises, huh?

289
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,333
- Did you check there?
- Where?

290
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:15,792
There.

291
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,500
Where the jars are.

292
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,250
Have a look inside.

293
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,625
It's empty.

294
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,833
Looks like there's a bit of oil
in this one.

295
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:37,542
Sure?

296
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:52,708
- No one here.
- Nothing?

297
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,750
Scram!

298
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,333
Scram!

299
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,417
Scram, that isn't for you!

300
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,500
Give it to me!

301
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,167
Rosa.

302
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,292
Rosa.

303
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:33,458
What did they do to you?

304
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,917
What happened?

305
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:43,167
What happened?

306
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,625
What happened to you?

307
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,292
They told me that they'd caught you.

308
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,083
I didn't say a word.

309
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,583
It's over. Let them just catch me.

310
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:28,042
Why am I here
if I can't even take care of you?

311
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,417
Come here.

312
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,333
Higinio.

313
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,375
What?

314
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,958
They told me I have to report
to the barracks every day.

315
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:33,750
And...

316
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:37,375
They've made me leave
the front door open.

317
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,833
It's all right.

318
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,792
It's fine.

319
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,667
Promise me you won't come out
if I'm not here.

320
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:48,958
Promise me.

321
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:51,958
Swear on it.

322
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,458
I swear.

323
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:13,708
What do you imagine
the sea looks like?

324
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
I don't know.

325
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,667
"Gonzalo is coming."

326
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:19,042
I imagine...

327
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,208
that it must be like
the countryside...

328
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,292
"I miss you."

329
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:25,458
...in summer when the sunlight
is shining down hard

330
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,833
and it merges with the horizon.

331
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,167
Like that, but with water.

332
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:34,333
"Don't go yet."

333
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,583
What a pity.

334
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:36,958
"I love you."

335
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,667
We should have let your father
pay for the honeymoon.

336
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,958
We'll enjoy it more when we do it
with the money we earn.

337
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:49,167
"Do you know what day today is?"

338
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,542
"Of course, happy anniversary."

339
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:57,792
Rosa.

340
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,292
Don't forget
to stir the ashes properly later.

341
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,875
All right.

342
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,583
You told me three times already.

343
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:13,250
What about the books
I asked you for?

344
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,917
I can't be seen bringing books
on politics...

345
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:21,042
and things that...
It's obvious they're not for me.

346
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:33,500
- Kids, come here. Hello.
- Hello.

347
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,292
What are you doing?

348
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,375
Do me a favour and get in there.

349
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,708
Can you please get in there?

350
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,625
I'm listening to what people
are saying.

351
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:03,458
I saw Pero when I was peeking
through the window.

352
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:07,123
Wasn't he on the front
with the Nationalist faction?

353
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:13,542
Either he has a twin brother
or he's out there celebrating the victory.

354
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,083
Rosa.

355
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:31,667
Is it over?

356
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,208
So why don't you tell me?

357
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,292
Because it isn't over.

358
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,583
They executed Arenas.

359
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,917
And Enrique, Andrés, Quijo.

360
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:02,250
They killed all the councillors
that they caught.

361
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,458
They've put out a reward
for your capture.

362
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:13,375
I heard they're offering
60,000 pesetas.

363
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,375
What have I done
to be worth that much?

364
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:20,333
I don't know, they're saying
you did terrible things.

365
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,958
- Who's saying that?
- Everyone.

366
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,417
Those coming back
from the front...

367
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:31,000
are blaming those of you
who didn't come back.

368
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,750
So, it isn't over.

369
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:56,750
danger - risk or imminent possibility
that something bad may occur.

370
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,917
Think she knows something?

371
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:12,458
I think so.
She's hiding something.

372
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,875
We have to interrogate her,
get as much as we can.

373
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:19,333
- Interrogate her right here.
- I don't agree.

374
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:22,417
Let's take her with us.
Interrogate her and whatever else.

375
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,083
No, no way.
Listen to me.

376
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,750
We do as I say, interrogate her here.

377
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,000
You're shouting.

378
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:12,500
It'll happen again,
just wait and see.

379
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,625
Since the war ended
he's become even more obsessed.

380
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Rosa!

381
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:24,458
Gonzalo, It’s Higinio, my father-in-law.
We are having dinner, okay?

382
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,542
Okay.

383
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:27,792
Same thing every day.

384
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,375
So, is Higinio all right?

385
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,667
He's all right.

386
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,958
But this is getting unbearable.

387
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:44,292
He's beginning to shout in his sleep.

388
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:47,667
They turned the place upside
down the other day...

389
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,833
I don't know how
they didn't find him.

390
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,875
You mean he's here?

391
00:39:58,542 --> 00:39:59,542
He's there.

392
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,667
Under the jars.

393
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,958
He's hiding inside there.

394
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,667
Dear God.

395
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,333
He's been there three years.

396
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,500
Pretty much.

397
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:24,208
If you want, fetch the plates
on the shelf and have a word.

398
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:28,125
Do me a favour
and fetch me those plates, please.

399
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:34,333
Father.

400
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,792
Pick something off the shelf,
anything.

401
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,083
But why didn't you say anything to me?

402
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,750
We thought it was best
not to tell anyone.

403
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,333
Father, I need your help.

404
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:49,708
Whatever you want.

405
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:53,000
The wall where the sideboard is.

406
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:55,500
I need you to build a false wall,

407
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,500
and then make a hole
behind the sideboard.

408
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,917
You want to hide in there?

409
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,208
Yes.

410
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,750
Your house is safer.

411
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:06,375
Rosa will show you the plans.

412
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,875
The sooner you build the wall,
the better.

413
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:25,833
As soon as it's ready,
Higinio will go there.

414
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,875
What about you?

415
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,000
I...
If you don't mind,

416
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,083
I'd move in with you.

417
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:39,667
If people ask, we tell them
that money is really tight and...

418
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,958
that way I can take charge
of your deceased wife's workshop.

419
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,417
Quick.

420
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,375
Remember to clean the hole with anise
and lavender to get rid of the smell.

421
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:57,542
Okay.

422
00:41:57,667 --> 00:42:00,458
No, hang on. Wait.
Let's see.

423
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,750
Done.

424
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,583
That's it.

425
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,000
That's it.

426
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,750
Ready.

427
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,750
You'll do a good job.
Nice and quick.

428
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:18,250
Go on, off you go.

429
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:19,750
Rosa.

430
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:23,125
Do it now while everyone
is at the procession, hurry.

431
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:35,917
What is it?

432
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,375
- I can't.
- Yes you can.

433
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:42,000
What do you mean?
Listen to me.

434
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:44,000
If you stay, they'll catch you.

435
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,833
You have to go now.

436
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,125
Of course you can.
Why wouldn't you?

437
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:51,375
You can do it.

438
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,375
I won't leave you alone.

439
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,500
You'll do a great job, okay?

440
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:58,208
Come on.

441
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:03,042
REDS OUT
LONG LIVE SPAIN

442
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,542
Hurry.

443
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:28,667
Come on, we'll be late.

444
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:30,042
Move it.

445
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:21,917
Are you looking for something, madam?

446
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,458
Excuse me!

447
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,083
Excuse me!

448
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:33,458
Halt, this is the Civil Guard!

449
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,208
Stop or I'll shoot!

450
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,458
This is the Civil Guard!

451
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,625
Come in.

452
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,167
Take off those clothes.

453
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:39,458
All of them.

454
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,375
Why did you take so long?

455
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,000
I got lost.

456
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:47,750
- In your village?
- Yes.

457
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,625
There's a basin in there
to wash yourself.

458
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:53,708
Come on, hurry up.

459
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:31,542
Son.

460
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,083
Are you all right?

461
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:34,917
Yes.

462
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:37,083
Do you need anything?

463
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:38,250
No.

464
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,750
- If you need anything...
- Silence!

465
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:43,875
Silence.

466
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,167
That's what I need.

467
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:07,375
enclose - put a person or an animal
in a place they cannot leave.

468
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,917
I saw him in the square,
next to the barracks.

469
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,333
So sad he couldn't
say goodbye to his son.

470
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:19,208
Now he's left this world
and won't be able to.

471
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:57,917
Let's be on our way.

472
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:42,792
FEBRUARY 8th, 1944

473
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,417
I have three sacks of dirt, you know?

474
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,000
Give them to me tomorrow.

475
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:41,375
I reckon that in about a year or so

476
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:45,667
I'll have dug the hole
as far as the grove.

477
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,292
And if anything happens...

478
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,167
Higinio, I want a baby.

479
00:50:58,542 --> 00:51:00,083
Not this again, Rosa.

480
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:03,083
Didn't we say when the allies
won the war?

481
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,083
And when will that be?
When will they win?

482
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:11,250
When I can't have children anymore?

483
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:15,792
When my belly starts showing,
I'll go to Granada.

484
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:18,625
Then I'll say it's a nephew
I have to take care of.

485
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:22,500
Meanwhile, how do I survive?

486
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,417
I'll leave you food
and whatever else you need.

487
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,375
Can you hear yourself?

488
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,542
Don't you realise it's absurd
and really dangerous?

489
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,542
Do you realise they could kill you,
me and the baby?

490
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:40,250
Do you realise what might happen?

491
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,125
Let's use our heads.
Is the time to save.

492
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:49,042
I can lend you a hand darning,
doing hems... Please, Rosa.

493
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,875
Let's use our heads.

494
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,958
Let's give the allies some time.

495
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:09,375
<i>Today, 6 June 1944,</i>

496
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,708
<i>the allies have started disembarking
over 150,000 troops.</i>

497
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:18,417
<i>Led by General Eisenhower, allied troops</i>

498
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:22,500
<i>have overcome the defences
developed by Field Marshal Rommel.</i>

499
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,375
<i>British and US command of the air</i>

500
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,708
<i>were key to the success
of the operation.</i>

501
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:33,000
<i>Allied aircraft have destroyed
bridges over the Seine and the Loire.</i>

502
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:38,083
<i>The successful landing has enabled
allied troops to quickly advance</i>

503
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,042
<i>towards the heart of France.</i>

504
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,417
Hold your arms out.

505
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:52,542
Great.

506
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:55,708
- Looks good, huh?
- Yes. Will you wear it now?

507
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:57,958
I'll button it up like that.

508
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,667
This...

509
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:03,167
I'll have the other one by Thursday.

510
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,208
Okay?

511
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,083
Great.

512
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:09,958
All right.

513
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:17,208
You're an artist Rosa.

514
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:21,750
Now you can tell people I don't
just sew uniforms. I mend all sorts.

515
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,167
And for a good price, too.

516
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:26,042
And they get to see
the prettiest seamstress.

517
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:29,167
You're a smooth one.
I'm charging you the same.

518
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:32,042
I'm just saying it as an art lover.

519
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,833
Where are my boots?

520
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:36,958
Oh, yes.

521
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:27,792
Stop.

522
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:32,625
No, stop.

523
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:35,292
Not now, stop.

524
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:38,375
I have to get my period, stop.

525
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:24,625
A fun girl from Córdoba.

526
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:27,458
It's what made me
fall in love with her.

527
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,292
Things were different then.

528
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:34,500
Because for a few months now,

529
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,917
...she always looks sad.

530
00:55:38,833 --> 00:55:40,542
Like she's not excited about anything.

531
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:43,792
Now all she does is eat.

532
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,958
All she does is eat,
never leaves the house.

533
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:52,000
I say, "Carmen, let's go to
the festival, make yourself pretty...

534
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:54,333
A colourful dress, let's..."

535
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:57,917
- Make the most of the festival.
- Like before...

536
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,167
She doesn't feel up to it.

537
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:01,958
She's not the same now.

538
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,458
Poor thing.

539
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,000
Maybe I rushed into getting married.

540
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:13,375
Don't say that, Rodrigo.

541
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:18,667
These things take time,
they take getting used to.

542
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:22,417
Why that face?

543
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:24,042
What face?

544
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:26,042
That face.

545
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,792
What face?

546
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:30,500
You smiled, didn't you?

547
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:36,500
Do you find it funny to see me
full of doubts?

548
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:39,167
No, it's the other way around.

549
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:41,792
I feel sad for both of you.

550
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:44,500
Anyway, I don't know...

551
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,167
There's another hole here, too.

552
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:50,542
- Another one?
- Yes.

553
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,667
I hadn't seen that one.

554
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,792
That's from Sunday.

555
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:10,042
I'll mend that for you.
I'll cover it up so you won't see it.

556
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:21,042
I know you feel the same way
as I do.

557
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:24,333
How do you mean?

558
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:30,917
Stop, stop.

559
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,708
I said stop!

560
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,125
Rosa...

561
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:38,125
Get out of my house right now.

562
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:43,500
I told you to get out right now
or I'll start screaming.

563
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:44,708
Take it easy.

564
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,708
I'm leaving.

565
00:57:58,458 --> 00:57:59,667
Coward...

566
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:03,958
It's shameful.

567
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,750
It's shameful.

568
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:16,792
Coward.

569
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,167
Really, it's shameful.

570
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:28,000
Do you think
I don't know you're there...

571
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,958
...watching?

572
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,667
You saw it, right?

573
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,917
I'm talking to you.

574
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:44,333
See what he was going
to do to me?

575
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,125
Don't do a thing.

576
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:55,958
Just stay there, all shut in.

577
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,000
Like a worm, like a coward.

578
00:58:59,042 --> 00:59:01,500
It's as if you were dead already!

579
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,125
- Rosa, please.
- Rosa, what?

580
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:06,333
- Everyone will hear you.
- What do I care if they hear me?

581
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,083
You're not here, are you?

582
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,208
Are you?

583
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:17,917
Is there somebody here?

584
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,250
I'm asking you

585
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:23,958
if you're here.

586
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:28,958
You're not here.

587
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:31,500
I'm all alone.

588
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:38,000
You're not a man, a husband,
a father, you're nothing. I'm alone.

589
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:43,250
Who are you?

590
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:53,958
Get in there and read your
trashy novels, and shut the door!

591
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,292
Father?

592
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:02,750
Rosa! Anyone there?

593
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:06,208
What are you doing here?
Please leave.

594
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:08,458
No, let me explain.

595
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:12,625
In the last few days I've been
thinking a lot about what happened.

596
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,125
As well as apologising to you,

597
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:20,875
I'd like to regain
our professional relationship.

598
01:01:21,292 --> 01:01:24,250
I think that this got
a little out of hand.

599
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:31,167
I brought you this coat to sew,
because the sleeves are torn

600
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,375
and the pockets.

601
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,667
Please put it there and leave.

602
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:52,208
Don't you want to talk
about what happened?

603
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:58,958
Rosa, that's enough.

604
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:47,958
The scissors!

605
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:50,958
Grab them!

606
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:07,625
There.

607
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:51,417
Did I kill him?

608
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:53,958
Did I kill him?

609
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:03,917
I want to leave.

610
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,292
I want to leave.

611
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:18,208
Rosa, please, we can't.

612
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:21,417
If they find him, they'll kill us.

613
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,458
We have to hide him and get rid
of him, then we'll decide what to do.

614
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:27,875
Okay?

615
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:30,958
Don't worry.

616
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,042
My mattress was on fire.

617
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:50,875
That's why I took so long.

618
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,167
I think that a lot of dirt
is going to be needed here.

619
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,958
- Good afternoon, Rosa.
- Hello.

620
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:19,875
This young lady was knocking
on the door of your old house.

621
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:23,667
I came out and told her you hadn't
lived there for at least five years.

622
01:06:23,917 --> 01:06:25,500
I was given the wrong address.

623
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:27,250
This is Mari Carmen,

624
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,167
the wife of Rodrigo,
the civil guard who went missing.

625
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,333
I know.

626
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,667
I'm really sorry.

627
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:37,167
I'm visiting places he used to go
in case somebody knows something.

628
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:40,750
His colleagues told me he brought
the company uniforms here

629
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,000
so you would mend them.

630
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:45,000
Yes, sometimes he brought me things.

631
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,375
Thank you for coming with me Gonzalo.
It was very kind of you.

632
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:50,958
Would you mind
if I spoke to her alone?

633
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,542
Not at all, at your service.

634
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:55,208
All right, goodbye.

635
01:06:58,167 --> 01:06:59,458
May I come in?

636
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,875
Yes, of course.

637
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,458
I don't think
I'll be able to help you very much.

638
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:21,417
Sorry.

639
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:25,875
I'm sorry, but...

640
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,458
I know that you lost your husband,
too.

641
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,833
Maybe you could tell me...

642
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,125
...what I should do, because...

643
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:42,667
...I feel lost.

644
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,083
Take it easy.
I'll fetch you some water.

645
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:32,417
This belonged to my husband.

646
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:37,458
You see...

647
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:41,083
He left it for me to mend the sleeve,
but what with...

648
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:45,167
...everything that happened,
I forgot that I had it.

649
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,500
It still smells of him.

650
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,208
If you want,
I can mend it this evening.

651
01:08:58,542 --> 01:08:59,958
And give it to you tomorrow.

652
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,292
Obviously, I won't charge.

653
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:11,958
Afternoon.

654
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:23,083
I saw General Franco.

655
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:28,542
Where?

656
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,333
In the newsreel they showed
before the film.

657
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:38,000
He doesn't sound like a leader...

658
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:41,833
He doesn't sound like a leader?

659
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:44,875
So, what does he sound like?

660
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,458
What does that mean?

661
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,708
Well, his voice is sort of...

662
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,167
...very gentle, like...

663
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:53,958
Like nothing much.

664
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,708
When we listen to him on the radio
you say that he scares you.

665
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,750
Because I've realised that if you only
listen to him and don't see him, okay.

666
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:07,667
But if you see him talking, you say...

667
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:10,750
He looks like a woman in disguise.

668
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:12,167
God, Rosa.

669
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:14,083
It's true.

670
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,000
It's true, he doesn't look...

671
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:22,375
His body doesn't match that
of a head of...

672
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:28,417
<i>There are those who have tried to</i>

673
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,417
<i>speculate about current difficulties,</i>

674
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,667
<i>as if they were not something
other generations bequeathed us.</i>

675
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:39,667
<i>All of today's difficulties
stem from the Spain of the past.</i>

676
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:43,958
<i>In spite of these difficulties,
today Spain has been reborn,</i>

677
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,375
<i>a Spain that is guided
along the path of...</i>

678
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:18,375
What's this?

679
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,333
What are we celebrating?

680
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:22,083
I'm expecting.

681
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:31,833
We're going to have a baby.

682
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,208
Are you sure?

683
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:42,708
Why wouldn't I be sure?

684
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:52,042
- Rosa, are you sure that it's...?
- Higinio...

685
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:55,083
- No, Rosa...
- Higinio, please.

686
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,667
No, wait a minute...

687
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:01,833
It's our baby and we're having it.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

688
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,167
Why not...?

689
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:36,833
ally - said of a State,
country, army, etc.,

690
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:39,917
that is linked to another
for a common purpose.

691
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,042
<i>Dear cousin,</i>

692
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:15,542
<i>I hope that things
are nice and quiet there.</i>

693
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:17,667
<i>I miss you.</i>

694
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:20,375
<i>I know that the last few weeks
we spent together</i>

695
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:22,042
<i>were not easy,</i>

696
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:25,875
<i>but we'll be able
to talk about it soon.</i>

697
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,292
<i>I can't wait to see you
and give you a hug, I love you.</i>

698
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:32,125
<i>Your cousin Beatriz.</i>

699
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:36,125
<i>Allied attacks have spread
through the Ardennes.</i>

700
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:39,958
<i>The Allies have occupied
towns to the west of Bastogne.</i>

701
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:44,083
<i>German troops continue
to be overcome in bloody battles.</i>

702
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,333
<i>In Greece, Churchill has urged
the unconditional surrender...</i>

703
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,292
Coming.

704
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:33,708
OK.

705
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,250
This way.

706
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,667
Come here.

707
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:30,042
If you know the owner isn't here,
why do you leave her post?

708
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:32,583
What are you doing there?
They'll see you.

709
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,500
There's no one outside at this time.

710
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:37,125
And don't smoke here.

711
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:40,250
You really are stupid, huh?

712
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:42,375
Stop it, you taste of cigarettes.

713
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:46,792
- Give me a hug, then.
- You're desperate, aren't you?

714
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:48,958
Get off me.

715
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,208
Why do you get so uptight?

716
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:52,792
I don't get uptight.

717
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,667
Yes, you do.

718
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,958
Like when I accidentally
brush against your hand.

719
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,042
Yes, accidentally on purpose.

720
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:03,083
I'm just a bit cautious,
whereas you're irresponsible.

721
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:08,917
Tell me something.

722
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,250
If they assured you

723
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:15,083
that no one would say anything
for kissing me in public,

724
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:16,958
would you do it?

725
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:21,750
What a stupid question, huh?

726
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:24,917
Answer me.

727
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,458
Answer me. Would you kiss me?

728
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:33,875
I guess. I don't know, I guess so.

729
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,083
I don't think so.

730
01:16:35,667 --> 01:16:36,667
Hey, cut it out.

731
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,000
Let go.

732
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,375
Cut it out.

733
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:42,708
I'll make you relax.

734
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:44,792
I'll tickle you.

735
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:47,333
I won't let you go.

736
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:51,125
- Crap.
- Wait, wait.

737
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,375
It's okay.

738
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:53,542
Leave it there.

739
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:55,083
- Bollocks.
- Shit.

740
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:56,958
Is it broken?

741
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,542
Leave it.
Let's go.

742
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:29,625
Jesus!

743
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:35,375
Go on, get dressed.

744
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:50,875
Will you report us?

745
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,458
How are things on the outside?

746
01:17:59,792 --> 01:18:00,958
- What?
- The World War.

747
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:04,750
The Allies.
How are they doing?

748
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,792
They're advancing, aren't they?

749
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,625
Yes, they're advancing, I mean...

750
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,333
they're winning.

751
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:16,375
They're advancing?

752
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:18,917
I think this war
is never going to end.

753
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:20,125
That's what I think.

754
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:22,542
Please don't tell anyone.

755
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:25,708
Do me a favour
and don't talk rubbish.

756
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,250
Why would I say anything?

757
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:29,292
I just appeared before you two.

758
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:30,778
But don't tell your wife, either.

759
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:33,125
No one is going to say anything here,
okay?

760
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:36,417
Now that you mentioned Rosa,

761
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,500
until she gets back here,

762
01:18:38,667 --> 01:18:41,458
you'll bring me a nice stew
twice a week.

763
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,625
I could eat a horse.

764
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:47,958
And when you come,

765
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:51,083
pop a newspaper in the letter box,
any one will do.

766
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:53,792
Maybe I'll find out what's going on.

767
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:56,958
All right?

768
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,208
All right?

769
01:19:00,292 --> 01:19:01,708
- All right.
- All right.

770
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:14,792
Obviously...

771
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:18,000
mistakes were made or else
we wouldn't be in this situation.

772
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:21,000
But some good things were done
in the Republican period.

773
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:24,500
For example,
legislating for land redistribution,

774
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:27,042
teaching people to read and write,
healthcare,

775
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:30,375
making sure everyone has access
to medical treatment.

776
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:31,958
It's a human rights matter.

777
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,958
That can all be achieved.

778
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:37,750
People should have a decent living.

779
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:39,917
Don't you think so?

780
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:43,250
I don't get involved
in those sort of things.

781
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:46,000
Politics and me...

782
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:47,833
Nothing.

783
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:53,417
That's what the regime
has achieved.

784
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,375
Ensuring people don't think.

785
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,875
Imagine that what you say happens,

786
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:07,292
the Allies win the War
and they oust Franco from power.

787
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,042
What would you do?

788
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:12,333
Go out.

789
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,083
Out on the street to celebrate.

790
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:16,750
Like that?

791
01:20:16,917 --> 01:20:18,000
Just like that?

792
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,625
Isn't that enough?

793
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:22,083
And keep on fighting
for what I said.

794
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,500
And will you tell everyone
what I am?

795
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,958
I'm a man of my word.

796
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,958
But you'd still look at me
with a long face.

797
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:43,000
The Allies won't change that.

798
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:45,292
Or anyone else.

799
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,667
What I can't change
is what goes on in your head.

800
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:50,917
What I think is my business.

801
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,417
Okay.

802
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:58,208
I'll tell you one thing.

803
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:01,042
Your mother's chickpeas
are the best I've ever eaten.

804
01:21:04,917 --> 01:21:06,042
See you on Thursday?

805
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,917
Thursday?
Maybe.

806
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:11,542
If Rosa hasn't come back yet.
It can't be long now.

807
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:16,083
Well, you can come anyway.

808
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:18,667
And how will you explain it to her?

809
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,542
I don't know.

810
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:25,875
Just in case, I'll say goodbye, okay?
Bye, Higinio.

811
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,125
Bye, Enrique.

812
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:32,542
Careful on your way out.

813
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,292
Don't worry.

814
01:22:04,292 --> 01:22:05,292
Higinio.

815
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,958
- How are you?
- Fine.

816
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:48,542
- What about you?
- Let me take a look.

817
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,625
You look great.

818
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:55,375
Better than I expected to find you.

819
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:11,958
It's a boy.

820
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,250
Come here.

821
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,250
Oh, my little one.

822
01:23:37,792 --> 01:23:38,958
Did you see?

823
01:23:39,292 --> 01:23:40,292
Say hello.

824
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,792
Seen how little he is?

825
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,750
Not that little,
he weighed almost 5kg.

826
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:50,292
The doctor said he'd never seen
anything like it in his life.

827
01:23:56,042 --> 01:23:57,917
We're going to have a problem.

828
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:00,958
He looks just like you.

829
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:03,500
Yes?

830
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:06,542
You know what they'll say
in the village?

831
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,375
Just like me.

832
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:11,875
Yes, for now.

833
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,958
He doesn't know you yet.

834
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:22,958
There, there, sweetie.

835
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:37,500
<i>Today marks the Allied victory
in Europe.</i>

836
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:40,125
<i>Germany has surrendered
unconditionally.</i>

837
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:42,375
<i>War is over in Europe.</i>

838
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:46,458
<i>The surrender was signed
in Reims at 2.41am.</i>

839
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:48,292
<i>The United Press agency</i>

840
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:51,792
<i>announces that the German
foreign minister, von Krosigk,</i>

841
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,958
<i>broadcasting from Flensburg,</i>

842
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,292
<i>states that the high command
accepts unconditional surrender.</i>

843
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:01,292
<i>The same agency adds that
the official declaration of victory</i>

844
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:03,292
<i>will be made at 6pm...</i>

845
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:04,958
This is going to end.

846
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:08,000
- We'll be able to go outside.
- He was just going to sleep.

847
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:10,500
It doesn't matter,
we have to celebrate

848
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,042
that I'm going to give you
the life you deserve.

849
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,958
Right now, Jaime. Jaime.

850
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:16,958
- Give him to me.
- Right now, right now.

851
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,000
With Daddy.
Right now with Daddy on the street.

852
01:25:34,667 --> 01:25:35,792
Jaime!

853
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,083
Jaime!

854
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:41,042
What are you doing?

855
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,292
Going to the promenade, coming?

856
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:46,292
Can Antonio come with us?

857
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:48,500
There are a lot of us.

858
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:50,292
Just to look, then.

859
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,500
Okay.

860
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:52,625
Let's go.

861
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:06,417
decade - period of ten years.

862
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:11,375
Again? Do me a favour

863
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,792
and close things.
I've told you before.

864
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:15,667
Done.

865
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:18,625
Spain has joined the UN.

866
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,292
What's that?

867
01:26:20,458 --> 01:26:22,333
A group of nations

868
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:25,042
that joined together
to solve things peacefully.

869
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:27,625
Do they know what Franco
is doing here?

870
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:31,000
No idea.
But now we're a member of the UN.

871
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,917
Watch out, this is hot.

872
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:39,250
Who's that kid you were with
this morning, Jaime?

873
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:40,833
Rafa.

874
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:45,667
Where did you go?

875
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:47,750
To play football.

876
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:52,208
To that waste ground where I told you
it was good for playing?

877
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:56,875
And who played?

878
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,625
Lots of kids you don't know.

879
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,417
If you tell me who they are I will.

880
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:04,000
I don't know their names.

881
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,458
Well, you must call them something.

882
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:09,125
Tom, Dick, Harry,
pass me the ball, right?

883
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:11,792
We're not much bothered
about names.

884
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:14,292
I say: hey, pass it!
That's it.

885
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,583
Sit in. Hang on, wait...

886
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:18,583
That's it.

887
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,042
There you go.

888
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:23,167
Here.

889
01:27:24,792 --> 01:27:26,792
What's going on in the village?

890
01:27:29,292 --> 01:27:31,292
Life, Higinio, I don't know.

891
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,917
Something must be going on, huh?

892
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:39,750
They ran over Pruden's dog yesterday.

893
01:27:40,958 --> 01:27:42,875
Enrique the postman
is getting married.

894
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:45,042
He's getting married?

895
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:51,083
Everyone thought he'd stay a bachelor,
but no, he's marrying.

896
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:01,833
Stop that please, Jaime,
I can't concentrate.

897
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:07,083
Why are you wearing
a woman's cardigan?

898
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,917
Don't you like it?

899
01:28:09,042 --> 01:28:10,375
I don't know.

900
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,917
- You know what you have to do.
- What?

901
01:28:15,417 --> 01:28:16,458
Grow up.

902
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:18,083
Okay.

903
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,292
I'll get it.

904
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:27,042
Shut that.

905
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:33,167
Shut it, will you?

906
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,375
Is your aunt there?

907
01:28:34,583 --> 01:28:35,667
No, she went out.

908
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:38,000
These trousers need mending.

909
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:41,833
You can leave them here,
I'll make a note. Come in.

910
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:46,000
What's your name?
What do you need?

911
01:28:46,417 --> 01:28:48,458
Aren't you a bit young for this?

912
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:52,667
Dunno. I've done it a thousand times.

913
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:53,917
Yeah?

914
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,542
All right, write this down.

915
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:01,375
That's it.

916
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:04,292
My name is Gonzalo Palacio.

917
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,417
- Okay.
- Look.

918
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:10,750
The zip needs fixing, look...

919
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:13,417
It needs changing, I don't know.

920
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:15,958
And then, this hole here.
Look.

921
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:20,250
Okay?

922
01:29:22,417 --> 01:29:23,875
So, what's up?

923
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:28,000
You're the man of the house, right?

924
01:29:29,417 --> 01:29:30,417
Yeah.

925
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:32,708
Is your aunt good to you?

926
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:40,333
You know that your aunt and uncle
were neighbors of mine?

927
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:42,667
They were tough on me.

928
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,917
And do you miss them?

929
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:53,458
Who?

930
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,875
Who do you think?
Your mum and dad.

931
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

932
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:03,917
What's up?

933
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,750
Are you unsure?

934
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:07,833
No.

935
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:10,167
I'm not unsure.

936
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,917
You wouldn't remember,
you were little, weren't you?

937
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,417
Has the cat got your tongue?

938
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,417
I don't bite, lad.

939
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:23,833
Hello, Gonzalo.

940
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:25,417
- Afternoon.
- What's up?

941
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:30,167
I brought these trousers for you
to mend and he was taking note.

942
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:32,250
Let's have a look.

943
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,542
Okay, then...

944
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:37,625
I'll have this ready in two days.

945
01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:40,167
- In two days?
- You can pick it up.

946
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:42,958
My wife might come by.

947
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:46,708
- All right. Bye, then.
- Okay. Bye, lad.

948
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:48,333
Bye.

949
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:49,958
- Bye, Rosa.
- Bye.

950
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:54,375
What's he doing here?
Why out of the blue?

951
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:57,000
- No idea.
- Don't you see him around?

952
01:30:57,167 --> 01:30:58,833
- Sometimes.
- How often?

953
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:00,417
The village isn't that big.

954
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:02,042
Let's think about it.

955
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,917
He must have said something,
hinted at something.

956
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:06,583
He came with the trousers.

957
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:10,958
He came so you could mend them
and something else, huh?

958
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:13,708
And what did I tell you?

959
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,083
How many times
have we rehearsed it?

960
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:20,625
I won't talk to strangers,
I won't talk to strangers...

961
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
All for nothing.

962
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:23,458
Sorry.

963
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:25,458
No, they'll kill me!

964
01:31:25,667 --> 01:31:28,167
- Wise up, they'll kill me!
- That's enough.

965
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:31,833
Wise up, this isn't a game.

966
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:34,000
- Pay him no heed, son.
- I'm sorry.

967
01:32:55,417 --> 01:33:00,625
separate - isolated, distant, remote.

968
01:33:02,417 --> 01:33:04,667
The kids will have a real feast.

969
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,458
Are we all ready?
Jaime!

970
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:13,625
Jaime!

971
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,542
Hurry up, love.

972
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:17,958
- Sorry, sorry.
- Everyone is waiting.

973
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:22,708
- Manuel, we're not models.
- Can you two swap?

974
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:25,458
Put your hands
on your mum's shoulders.

975
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:27,542
All right, just a second.

976
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:30,250
- All ready, okay?
- Right.

977
01:33:30,417 --> 01:33:31,542
We're ready.

978
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:33,292
Stand still, huh?

979
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:43,042
<i>The American military band plays
"Welcome to the Army."</i>

980
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:45,208
<i>They greet Eisenhower</i>

981
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:48,083
<i>against a backdrop of cheers
from the crowds here,</i>

982
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:49,417
<i>while he gets off the plane.</i>

983
01:33:49,542 --> 01:33:53,333
<i>His Excellency
is at the foot of the plane,</i>

984
01:33:53,417 --> 01:33:55,542
<i>and now both heads of state,</i>

985
01:33:55,708 --> 01:34:00,125
<i>President Eisenhower and Franco,
greet each other warmly.</i>

986
01:34:03,417 --> 01:34:08,083
<i>Franco is followed by the ministers
of Aviation and Foreign Affairs.</i>

987
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:14,708
<i>...the Spanish ambassadors
in Washington and the USA in Madrid,</i>

988
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:16,417
<i>and the Marquises of Villaverde...</i>

989
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:39,792
<i>Attention, the US president
is going to speak.</i>

990
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,917
What?

991
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,708
That dress really suits you.

992
01:35:19,042 --> 01:35:20,333
Thank you.

993
01:35:20,917 --> 01:35:22,375
Don't change.

994
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,000
Sure.

995
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,833
I like to see you looking pretty.

996
01:35:28,917 --> 01:35:30,542
Don't be silly...

997
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:46,542
The parish people
are organising trips.

998
01:36:48,417 --> 01:36:50,208
Anyone can sign up.

999
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,042
Fine.

1000
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:58,583
Some of the lad's friends
go with their parents.

1001
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:08,542
I was thinking that maybe
I could go with Jaime, too.

1002
01:37:09,458 --> 01:37:10,875
Where?

1003
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:13,875
The next trip is to Marbella.

1004
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,125
To the beach.

1005
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,958
But wasn't that for our honeymoon?

1006
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:28,875
What if there isn't one in the end?

1007
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:33,375
Why wouldn't there be?

1008
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:43,917
Besides, if something happens to me...

1009
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:48,167
If I fall ill or something happens,
who will come?

1010
01:37:50,708 --> 01:37:53,042
I think it's stupid, Rosa.

1011
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:12,583
<i>What will you do here by yourself?
Come on, you still have time.</i>

1012
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:16,167
<i>I wish I could, Puri.
I have a stack of work.</i>

1013
01:38:16,542 --> 01:38:17,333
<i>I can't.</i>

1014
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:19,208
<i>And behave yourself, huh?</i>

1015
01:38:19,375 --> 01:38:21,000
<i>Yes, don't worry, Auntie.</i>

1016
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:17,083
Can I have my handbag?

1017
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:20,333
Whose phone number is this,
please?

1018
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:23,458
Must be a customer's,
I don't remember.

1019
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,083
Since when do you smoke?

1020
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:26,208
I don't.

1021
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:32,792
- Why are you rummaging here?
- Figuring out what you keep from me.

1022
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:34,792
Just what I needed.

1023
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:38,083
Since when do you mix
with the civil guard's wife?

1024
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:41,208
Which civil guard?

1025
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:43,958
You can lie out there,
not here at home.

1026
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:46,583
Since when do you mix with her?

1027
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:51,208
- I don't know where...
- I saw you.

1028
01:39:51,417 --> 01:39:53,250
Don't kick up a fuss, okay?

1029
01:39:53,417 --> 01:39:57,583
Fifteen years hanging out with her
and you're not going to tell me?

1030
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:02,583
Not fifteen years,
things don't happen overnight.

1031
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:05,875
For God's sake, Rosa.

1032
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,125
For God's sake.

1033
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:10,708
Do you realise what you're doing?

1034
01:40:11,042 --> 01:40:12,917
You're jeopardising everything.

1035
01:40:13,042 --> 01:40:14,833
- What should I do?
- Why her?

1036
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:16,708
- Explain what...
- You explain.

1037
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:20,083
If she stops me on the street
and wants to chat, what?

1038
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:23,375
- Do I say no?
- Does it ease your conscience?

1039
01:40:23,542 --> 01:40:26,208
I'm the one who sleeps on top
of the dead body.

1040
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:28,250
Please, Rosa.

1041
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:30,542
Why don't you go outside?

1042
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:32,333
You can be yourself.

1043
01:40:32,542 --> 01:40:34,250
- Go on out.
- What?

1044
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:37,083
There's one Rosa here
and another out there.

1045
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:39,000
You're an impostor. I don't know you.

1046
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:40,333
Of course not.

1047
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:41,875
What can I do?

1048
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:46,292
Stay here? Crawl in there with you,
not have a life?

1049
01:40:46,375 --> 01:40:48,167
I'm your husband.

1050
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,250
- I'm sick of it, Higinio.
- Of what?

1051
01:40:51,542 --> 01:40:53,958
- What are you sick of?
- What?

1052
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,042
Of being cooped up? That's me.

1053
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:58,458
Sick of living this way,
I can't take it.

1054
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:01,708
Sick of lying to everyone
on the street.

1055
01:41:01,792 --> 01:41:05,583
And me? I don't see the light of day.
Twenty years cooped up.

1056
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:08,542
My whole life is you and a kid
who might not be mine.

1057
01:41:12,917 --> 01:41:14,000
Say that again.

1058
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:15,208
It was your idea.

1059
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:18,000
It was your idea, your idea.

1060
01:41:18,167 --> 01:41:21,667
- You said to me...
- Repeat what you just said.

1061
01:41:21,833 --> 01:41:24,958
- What you said about my son.
- You said, stay in there.

1062
01:41:25,167 --> 01:41:26,917
You locked me up for 20 years.

1063
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:28,167
There's a quick solution.

1064
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:30,125
Locked up in that shitty hole.

1065
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:32,292
I'll open the door for you, then.

1066
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:33,917
- Stop it.
- No, get out.

1067
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:35,958
- Go, I can't stand you anymore!
- Rosa.

1068
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:38,792
I can't stand you anymore.

1069
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,875
You're not even capable of going out.

1070
01:41:48,958 --> 01:41:51,875
You can't do it, that's your problem.

1071
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,375
Well, well, well...

1072
01:41:57,375 --> 01:42:00,708
We did all of this
so we could be together, right?

1073
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,083
Well look how together we are.

1074
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:08,333
You've broken...

1075
01:42:08,625 --> 01:42:09,917
...my things.

1076
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,625
When did you arrive?

1077
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:44,708
Last night.

1078
01:42:45,917 --> 01:42:48,875
He got in late.
That's why I didn't tell you.

1079
01:42:50,667 --> 01:42:52,375
He told me what the sea is like.

1080
01:42:52,542 --> 01:42:54,875
- Tell your dad.
- Yeah.

1081
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:57,250
I was telling her that it's salty.

1082
01:42:57,417 --> 01:43:00,042
But not like you've added salt to it.

1083
01:43:00,583 --> 01:43:02,375
A wave hit me in the face,

1084
01:43:02,583 --> 01:43:07,167
and it smelled like fresh fish
or something like that.

1085
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:09,667
And the temperature changes.

1086
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:13,583
Suddenly you feel a cold current
around your legs.

1087
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:17,667
You stay in the same place,
but there's another warm layer.

1088
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,625
Sounds nice.

1089
01:43:21,417 --> 01:43:25,042
And the seabed is strange,
it's like the land but...

1090
01:43:25,375 --> 01:43:27,667
it's all sand.

1091
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:30,542
What colour is it?

1092
01:43:31,333 --> 01:43:32,625
Dark blue.

1093
01:43:32,917 --> 01:43:36,000
And it looks greenish in other places.

1094
01:43:36,417 --> 01:43:39,250
As if it were moving.
The blue is...

1095
01:43:39,542 --> 01:43:41,417
mixed in with...

1096
01:43:41,833 --> 01:43:43,583
...with white.

1097
01:43:44,208 --> 01:43:47,833
to change - to modify appearance,
condition or behaviour.

1098
01:44:07,917 --> 01:44:10,750
SPAIN - 40 BILLION IN REVENUE
SUNSHINE BOOM

1099
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:22,833
FACING 1963 WITH OPTIMISM

1100
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:30,917
<i>Today, like yesterday.</i>

1101
01:44:35,208 --> 01:44:36,375
<i>Dear listeners...</i>

1102
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:40,458
Come out for a bit.
You've been cooped up all day.

1103
01:44:40,667 --> 01:44:42,250
I'm fine here.

1104
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:44,708
Want something?

1105
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:46,875
Hi.
I'm here with a friend.

1106
01:44:47,042 --> 01:44:48,583
Wait for me here.

1107
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:54,083
- Hi.
- Hi, Mum.

1108
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:55,833
Come here, Juan.

1109
01:44:56,833 --> 01:45:00,375
Dad, no need to worry,
Juan knows you're here.

1110
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:04,875
Sorry I couldn't let you know before,
but he's in a fix and needs help.

1111
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,250
Rosa, my mum.

1112
01:45:06,417 --> 01:45:07,458
Pleased to meet you.

1113
01:45:07,625 --> 01:45:10,958
Twenty-five years keeping it a secret
that I'm here,

1114
01:45:11,083 --> 01:45:13,458
and now because you think
things are changing,

1115
01:45:13,625 --> 01:45:16,375
you tell a friend your dad
is hiding here?

1116
01:45:16,667 --> 01:45:18,917
It's only for a couple of days.

1117
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:21,333
Can't you show some solidarity?

1118
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:23,792
What about your fighting spirit?

1119
01:45:35,958 --> 01:45:39,667
They found a guy in Segovia,
20 years in hiding.

1120
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:42,208
They got a tip-off.

1121
01:45:43,792 --> 01:45:46,875
They say Madrid has not a special group
to find your kind.

1122
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:50,833
The authorities find out
if there are local tip-offs or clues.

1123
01:45:50,958 --> 01:45:54,625
There's no specific search operation
organised from Madrid.

1124
01:45:54,792 --> 01:45:56,458
You're like a teacher.

1125
01:45:57,083 --> 01:45:58,083
Thanks.

1126
01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:59,792
It's not a compliment.

1127
01:46:12,875 --> 01:46:13,875
Yes?

1128
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:18,083
She says I'm getting obsessive,
won't give me information.

1129
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,208
Did they warn you?

1130
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,250
No, just said speak softly.

1131
01:46:24,125 --> 01:46:27,208
You said you saw
the other guy's hiding place.

1132
01:46:28,417 --> 01:46:30,708
Yeah, but when he wasn't there.

1133
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:33,583
Give me details.

1134
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:37,083
He was an anarchist
who fought on the front...

1135
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:39,417
No, I mean the hiding place.

1136
01:46:42,542 --> 01:46:44,917
Under a flight of stairs.

1137
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:47,625
He built a wall to cover the hole.

1138
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:55,708
If this was under the stairs...

1139
01:46:56,292 --> 01:46:58,250
the guy built a wall
to cover the hole.

1140
01:46:58,333 --> 01:47:00,417
You could only stand up in one place,

1141
01:47:00,625 --> 01:47:01,708
that was here.

1142
01:47:02,292 --> 01:47:04,583
It wasn't really very safe.

1143
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:06,750
Where did he do his business?

1144
01:47:07,667 --> 01:47:09,667
How did he crap?

1145
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:16,000
The upstairs drainpipe
went through the hole.

1146
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:19,042
He made a hole in the pipe,
did his business there.

1147
01:47:19,208 --> 01:47:22,083
I do it in a bucket
and then put it outside.

1148
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,250
Right.

1149
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:28,542
You can tell that other guy
about me,

1150
01:47:28,792 --> 01:47:31,000
but please don't mention my name.

1151
01:47:31,333 --> 01:47:32,333
All right.

1152
01:47:32,542 --> 01:47:36,667
Knowing there are others in a similar
situation will raise their spirits.

1153
01:47:36,792 --> 01:47:39,042
Makes them feel accompanied.

1154
01:47:40,208 --> 01:47:41,958
Accompanied, he says.

1155
01:47:42,542 --> 01:47:45,625
The only company here
are the creepy crawlies,

1156
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:47,583
the few bits and bobs,

1157
01:47:48,667 --> 01:47:50,958
and death.
That's all the company.

1158
01:47:51,042 --> 01:47:52,583
Don't say that.

1159
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:55,167
At least you could be with them.

1160
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:56,333
You're joking.

1161
01:47:57,083 --> 01:48:00,292
Where are they now?
Look at them, out there.

1162
01:48:00,458 --> 01:48:02,875
And here I am inside.

1163
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:08,250
Jaime has grown up
and I didn't even notice.

1164
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:13,875
Juan,

1165
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:15,083
listen to me.

1166
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:18,958
Forget leaflets and secret meetings.

1167
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:23,667
Go out and take a walk
with a woman on your arm.

1168
01:48:25,167 --> 01:48:27,917
And have kids,
play with them outdoors,

1169
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:29,958
like a father should.

1170
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:32,042
Listen to the kids laugh.

1171
01:48:32,792 --> 01:48:35,125
Not sit in here sewing like me.

1172
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:38,708
I'll carry on sewing.

1173
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:41,333
This order Rosa gave me...

1174
01:48:42,875 --> 01:48:45,750
is for the day before yesterday.

1175
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:57,750
franco (frank in Spanish)
simple, sincere, straightforward

1176
01:48:57,833 --> 01:48:58,833
and honest in attitude.

1177
01:48:59,167 --> 01:49:02,208
<i>Often, at the end of the year,</i>

1178
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:06,417
<i>when we gather at home
and engage in spiritual reflection</i>

1179
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,958
<i>in the peace of God...</i>

1180
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:11,958
Maybe it wasn't a good idea
to buy the TV.

1181
01:49:13,875 --> 01:49:17,167
<i>...wellbeing does not merely depend
on its smooth progress...</i>

1182
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:19,833
- We're paying a fortune...
- Rosa, please.

1183
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:21,792
I can't hear.

1184
01:49:23,083 --> 01:49:24,708
<i>...Spain is once again...</i>

1185
01:49:24,792 --> 01:49:26,625
Would you credit it, Dad?

1186
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:30,125
Hidden in a hole for 30 years
because of him and look at you.

1187
01:49:30,333 --> 01:49:31,375
What?

1188
01:49:31,583 --> 01:49:33,625
<i>Twenty-six years of peace...</i>

1189
01:49:33,833 --> 01:49:34,667
Forget it.

1190
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:39,292
<i>...in which we have lived united
by a common ideal,</i>

1191
01:49:39,375 --> 01:49:43,875
<i>upholding our goals of justice
with tireless perseverance...</i>

1192
01:49:43,958 --> 01:49:46,292
Dinner's served. Higinio.

1193
01:49:46,458 --> 01:49:48,000
<i>...while all around us...</i>

1194
01:49:48,167 --> 01:49:51,542
<i>a problematic world caused</i>

1195
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:53,958
<i>troubles, dramatic changes...</i>

1196
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:56,000
Help yourself, son.

1197
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:01,458
to dig up
1. Exhume, remove from under the earth.

1198
01:50:01,542 --> 01:50:05,708
2. Bring back the memory of what is
forgotten and buried in silence.

1199
01:50:05,792 --> 01:50:08,083
Here it is, I couldn't find it.

1200
01:50:09,333 --> 01:50:12,958
If you bought a TV,
things must be going well for you.

1201
01:50:13,042 --> 01:50:14,542
That's a laugh.

1202
01:50:15,125 --> 01:50:17,250
I've been paying it off for three years.

1203
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:19,958
What do I owe you?

1204
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:21,917
That'll be...

1205
01:50:22,958 --> 01:50:24,958
Thirty-five pesetas.

1206
01:50:26,458 --> 01:50:27,750
Jesus.

1207
01:50:28,208 --> 01:50:29,625
Make it thirty.

1208
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:37,750
I was in your old house the other day.

1209
01:50:37,917 --> 01:50:38,958
- Really?
- Yes.

1210
01:50:40,208 --> 01:50:42,458
A married couple moved in.

1211
01:50:43,208 --> 01:50:45,625
- Is María Ángeles not there?
- No.

1212
01:50:46,292 --> 01:50:50,667
Her mother fell ill and she left.
She isn't going to pay two rents.

1213
01:50:50,750 --> 01:50:52,458
So she left.

1214
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,250
I went to say hello to the couple
and they said, "Please come in."

1215
01:50:57,958 --> 01:51:02,667
"Did you know there was a hole
in the kitchen?" he says.

1216
01:51:03,333 --> 01:51:04,333
A hole?

1217
01:51:04,375 --> 01:51:06,167
A big one.

1218
01:51:06,417 --> 01:51:08,458
- Where the jars are.
- Right.

1219
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:10,000
The whole length of the shelf.

1220
01:51:10,417 --> 01:51:13,667
A person could fit in there
no trouble.

1221
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:15,667
First I heard of it.
Your change.

1222
01:51:15,917 --> 01:51:18,458
There was even an old blanket inside.

1223
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:22,208
- Must have belonged to María Ángeles.
- No.

1224
01:51:22,917 --> 01:51:24,792
I went to see her mother,

1225
01:51:25,167 --> 01:51:27,208
and I asked her.

1226
01:51:27,417 --> 01:51:29,792
She said she knew nothing about it.

1227
01:51:30,792 --> 01:51:34,458
I inherited that house
from my uncle, then I sold it,

1228
01:51:34,542 --> 01:51:36,958
I don't know what was there
or anything.

1229
01:51:37,167 --> 01:51:38,292
Sure.

1230
01:51:38,667 --> 01:51:40,500
Must have been your uncle's.

1231
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:42,917
- Yes, probably.
- Sure.

1232
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:46,250
- Okay, bye now.
- Okay, Rosa...

1233
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:48,542
Hang on.

1234
01:51:49,625 --> 01:51:51,375
- Must be careful...
- Don't trip.

1235
01:51:51,625 --> 01:51:53,292
...with the step. Okay.

1236
01:51:53,417 --> 01:51:54,958
- Bye then.
- Bye.

1237
01:52:13,292 --> 01:52:14,500
He's there again.

1238
01:52:16,333 --> 01:52:18,458
He won't give up till he catches me.

1239
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:22,292
Where?

1240
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:24,500
Over there, at the bar.

1241
01:52:27,958 --> 01:52:29,750
Because he gets bored.

1242
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:32,708
Since his wife died he gets bored.

1243
01:52:32,792 --> 01:52:34,125
He's been there two weeks.

1244
01:52:34,417 --> 01:52:36,917
You could stop staring out
the window, too.

1245
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:46,833
Why do all this now?

1246
01:52:47,083 --> 01:52:48,458
He knows the whole story.

1247
01:52:48,833 --> 01:52:50,333
He's obsessed.

1248
01:52:52,208 --> 01:52:53,667
God.

1249
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:56,750
Burn that.

1250
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,458
You'll have to take it out bit by bit.

1251
01:53:01,667 --> 01:53:03,000
If you do it all at once...

1252
01:53:06,167 --> 01:53:07,708
Oh, dear Lord.

1253
01:53:25,458 --> 01:53:27,250
Don't tell the lad about this.

1254
01:53:45,292 --> 01:53:46,542
It's me.

1255
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:52,625
Evening.

1256
01:53:53,083 --> 01:53:54,333
Evening.

1257
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,500
What are you doing?

1258
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Please don't go.
Don't leave me here alone.

1259
01:55:00,375 --> 01:55:04,000
Gonzalo isn't in the square, the lad
will be here soon. I won't be long.

1260
01:55:04,167 --> 01:55:06,333
- Don't worry.
- Rosa, please.

1261
01:55:07,292 --> 01:55:08,667
I'll be right back.

1262
02:00:17,333 --> 02:00:18,917
Fucking bastard...

1263
02:00:22,875 --> 02:00:24,958
There, I've got you...

1264
02:00:25,875 --> 02:00:27,500
Get in your little hole...

1265
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,417
I know you're there.

1266
02:00:32,917 --> 02:00:33,917
I saw you.

1267
02:00:34,542 --> 02:00:35,875
Higinio!

1268
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:39,083
You're in there.

1269
02:00:41,292 --> 02:00:44,292
You're there, you bastard.

1270
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:54,917
Open up! Open up!

1271
02:00:56,917 --> 02:00:58,708
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1272
02:00:58,792 --> 02:00:59,792
What do you mean?

1273
02:00:59,833 --> 02:01:00,833
Get out!

1274
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:04,083
- I saw him. I know he's hiding over there.
- Out!

1275
02:01:04,167 --> 02:01:07,000
- I'll tell everyone!
- Out! Out of here right now!

1276
02:01:07,083 --> 02:01:08,875
Get out right now!

1277
02:01:08,958 --> 02:01:11,333
Gonna hit an old man?

1278
02:01:11,417 --> 02:01:14,125
- Shame on you!
- Out of my house now!

1279
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:16,958
- You should be ashamed!
- Get out now!

1280
02:01:17,167 --> 02:01:19,625
He's hiding in there.

1281
02:01:19,792 --> 02:01:21,958
- I saw it all.
- What's going on?

1282
02:01:22,125 --> 02:01:24,875
- What is happening?
- Just as well you're here.

1283
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,750
They're hiding Higinio Blanco here,
a war criminal.

1284
02:01:28,833 --> 02:01:31,417
- That's a lie.
- He was sentenced in the year...

1285
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:34,542
- You're calling me a liar?
- Please calm down.

1286
02:01:34,667 --> 02:01:36,958
We're here about a broken door.

1287
02:01:37,083 --> 02:01:38,708
- Who lives here?
- Me.

1288
02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:40,375
I just arrived home...

1289
02:01:40,458 --> 02:01:43,458
I found him completely drunk
and in my house,

1290
02:01:43,542 --> 02:01:45,458
I don't know
what he came here to steal.

1291
02:01:45,667 --> 02:01:47,458
The back door is splintered.

1292
02:01:47,917 --> 02:01:49,333
Can you see it?

1293
02:01:49,958 --> 02:01:52,208
- Did you do that?
- Hang on...

1294
02:01:52,333 --> 02:01:54,625
I'm no thief,
I didn't come here to steal.

1295
02:01:54,792 --> 02:01:59,000
I'm telling you that a war criminal
is hiding here: Higinio Blanco.

1296
02:01:59,292 --> 02:02:02,375
- Did you force entry?
- Of course it was him.

1297
02:02:02,542 --> 02:02:04,333
My brother died because of him.

1298
02:02:04,458 --> 02:02:06,917
Did you break down the door
and trespass?

1299
02:02:06,958 --> 02:02:08,125
But what is this?

1300
02:02:08,333 --> 02:02:12,542
Please go in and take a look
at what I'm telling you about.

1301
02:02:12,667 --> 02:02:13,917
Have you been drinking?

1302
02:02:13,958 --> 02:02:16,250
Can't you see he stinks of alcohol?

1303
02:02:16,333 --> 02:02:19,125
- You'll have to come to the station.
- Take a look.

1304
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:22,000
- Why don't you do what I say?
- I give the orders here!

1305
02:02:22,083 --> 02:02:24,333
Both of you, down to the station now!

1306
02:02:24,458 --> 02:02:27,417
- Both? I told you all I know.
- I didn't do anything.

1307
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,542
You should look in there...

1308
02:02:48,542 --> 02:02:50,000
How are you, son?

1309
02:02:50,292 --> 02:02:52,417
- I'm fine. Where's Dad?
- In here.

1310
02:02:52,667 --> 02:02:54,083
Come in.

1311
02:02:54,417 --> 02:02:55,667
It's over.

1312
02:02:56,875 --> 02:02:58,000
Evening.

1313
02:02:58,083 --> 02:02:59,458
Did they accompany you?

1314
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:01,250
No, and they won't, either.

1315
02:03:01,417 --> 02:03:04,083
- What happened?
- They made him pay for the door.

1316
02:03:04,292 --> 02:03:06,167
And pay compensation, too.

1317
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,292
Good.

1318
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:12,125
What did he say at the station?

1319
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:17,333
What do you think?

1320
02:03:17,667 --> 02:03:19,542
Any old lie, I don't know.

1321
02:03:21,667 --> 02:03:23,458
He said you were an informer.

1322
02:03:24,292 --> 02:03:25,667
You reported neighbors.

1323
02:03:25,958 --> 02:03:29,042
You reported his brother
so they'd kill him.

1324
02:03:29,875 --> 02:03:31,375
Is that all true?

1325
02:03:33,958 --> 02:03:35,458
Is it true or not?

1326
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:40,417
Those of us who disappeared
were blamed for all the war crimes.

1327
02:03:41,167 --> 02:03:42,708
That's the truth.

1328
02:03:48,125 --> 02:03:49,625
I'm sick of this.

1329
02:03:50,417 --> 02:03:53,958
If I have to protect you,
I deserve to know who you are

1330
02:03:54,208 --> 02:03:55,958
and what you've done.

1331
02:03:57,083 --> 02:04:01,458
It's not normal that you've been there
30 years if you didn't do anything.

1332
02:04:01,708 --> 02:04:04,250
- Jaime...
- Don't start with this again.

1333
02:04:04,542 --> 02:04:07,792
You've been scaring me all my life,
I'm done.

1334
02:04:08,417 --> 02:04:10,417
I've been terrified since I was a kid,

1335
02:04:10,542 --> 02:04:13,375
measuring every gesture, look,
lying to everyone,

1336
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:16,708
saying my mother is my aunt
and I don't know my father,

1337
02:04:16,833 --> 02:04:18,792
when in fact he lived

1338
02:04:19,208 --> 02:04:20,792
behind a wall in my house,

1339
02:04:21,542 --> 02:04:22,958
hiding there like...

1340
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,042
Aren't you ashamed?
This is my house.

1341
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,333
Your house?

1342
02:04:27,917 --> 02:04:29,750
What house? Not here.

1343
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,917
That's your house, you live there.

1344
02:04:33,125 --> 02:04:37,625
Cowards who hid away while the others
fought and died on the front

1345
02:04:37,875 --> 02:04:41,000
have to live behind a wall
while our lives go on.

1346
02:04:41,083 --> 02:04:44,500
- Lower your voice, please.
- Who's listening?

1347
02:04:44,792 --> 02:04:46,750
- The neighbors?
- They can hear you.

1348
02:04:46,875 --> 02:04:49,375
They've known he's there
from the beginning.

1349
02:04:49,542 --> 02:04:51,958
Luisa told me she hears him
shouting in his sleep.

1350
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
- That's not true.
- Imagine his dreams.

1351
02:04:54,083 --> 02:04:58,292
Her parents think he's gone mad
from being locked up so long.

1352
02:04:58,458 --> 02:05:00,500
Hidden like a...

1353
02:05:00,667 --> 02:05:02,417
Always talking about fighting...

1354
02:05:02,958 --> 02:05:05,708
Your way of fighting meant nothing.

1355
02:05:05,792 --> 02:05:08,417
A coward who doesn't have the balls
to go outside.

1356
02:05:08,833 --> 02:05:11,167
Don't talk to your father that way.

1357
02:05:14,833 --> 02:05:17,917
You've no idea
what we've gone through for you.

1358
02:05:27,917 --> 02:05:30,042
I pity you two...

1359
02:05:32,125 --> 02:05:35,667
There's no one out there waiting
to eat you alive.

1360
02:05:37,708 --> 02:05:39,458
I was at the police station.

1361
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:43,458
Even the civil guard
aren't interested.

1362
02:06:04,375 --> 02:06:06,417
- Higinio.
- What?

1363
02:06:07,958 --> 02:06:10,208
Do you think the lad is right?

1364
02:06:11,417 --> 02:06:12,583
About what?

1365
02:06:13,667 --> 02:06:17,250
That if you came out,
nothing would happen.

1366
02:06:17,958 --> 02:06:18,958
No way.

1367
02:06:19,292 --> 02:06:21,083
Being in here is one thing,

1368
02:06:21,167 --> 02:06:23,958
them letting me
live out there is another.

1369
02:06:26,667 --> 02:06:28,583
- Good night.
- Good night.

1370
02:07:03,583 --> 02:07:04,917
Who's there?

1371
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:43,667
Took your time digging me up, huh?

1372
02:07:47,167 --> 02:07:49,708
Please swallow the smoke, it smells.

1373
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:08,500
It's really dry.

1374
02:08:08,958 --> 02:08:11,167
Dry...
Have you seen yourself?

1375
02:08:11,833 --> 02:08:13,417
You sure are dry.

1376
02:08:14,792 --> 02:08:15,792
That's true.

1377
02:08:19,833 --> 02:08:22,000
You're really brave, Higinio.

1378
02:08:23,167 --> 02:08:25,708
Brave enough not even to take
your own life.

1379
02:08:28,917 --> 02:08:30,583
I guess you're sick of hearing it,

1380
02:08:30,667 --> 02:08:34,667
but few people would put up
with this with your integrity.

1381
02:08:37,667 --> 02:08:38,833
Thanks.

1382
02:08:44,625 --> 02:08:47,750
Maybe your fear won't make people
see you as a hero.

1383
02:08:49,458 --> 02:08:52,167
But you're no less a victim
because of it.

1384
02:09:30,458 --> 02:09:31,875
Thanks.

1385
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,792
Oh, Higinio...

1386
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:02,958
amnesty - official pardon
for those convicted of political offences.

1387
02:10:46,458 --> 02:10:49,000
<i>Here is the news.</i>

1388
02:10:49,125 --> 02:10:52,167
<i>Commemorating the 30th anniversary
of the end of the Civil War</i>

1389
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:54,208
<i>and peace nationwide,</i>

1390
02:10:54,375 --> 02:10:57,500
<i>the Council of Ministers has

1391
02:10:57,583 --> 02:11:00,500
<i>ordering the expiration of offences

1392
02:11:00,583 --> 02:11:03,333
<i>any event related to the war.</i>

1393
02:11:03,875 --> 02:11:06,958
<i>The preamble of the Decree

1394
02:11:07,083 --> 02:11:10,792

1395

1399
02:11:23,667 --> 02:11:25,083
Rosa.

1400
02:11:25,167 --> 02:11:26,875
Amnesty has been declared.

1401
02:11:27,417 --> 02:11:28,958
Hold it there.

1402
02:11:29,458 --> 02:11:31,125
Down, down...

1403
02:11:32,958 --> 02:11:35,292
Put it on the bed.

1404
02:11:41,417 --> 02:11:43,625
No, this is bed linen.

1405
02:11:45,333 --> 02:11:47,833
The first thing we'll do
when we go out

1406
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,375
is buy you new clothes
so you look smart.

1407
02:11:52,583 --> 02:11:53,583
Let's see how...

1408
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:57,833
It doesn't fit, right?

1409
02:11:57,958 --> 02:12:00,917
I'll fetch some scissors
and fix it right away.

1410
02:12:01,667 --> 02:12:04,583
Now it's not dangerous to hang out
our clothes together.

1411
02:12:43,083 --> 02:12:44,083
Higinio...

1412
02:12:47,083 --> 02:12:49,000
Why did you take off the trousers?

1413
02:12:52,292 --> 02:12:54,750
- I don't know, Rosa.
- What do you mean?

1414
02:12:57,083 --> 02:13:01,500
What they say in Madrid doesn't matter
if a neighbor is after you.

1415
02:13:01,958 --> 02:13:03,208
What neighbor?

1416
02:13:03,292 --> 02:13:07,208
Didn't you hear what they're saying
on the radio and in the press?

1417
02:13:07,875 --> 02:13:09,708
It's not that bad here.

1418
02:13:10,125 --> 02:13:11,625
Come on.

1419
02:13:14,667 --> 02:13:16,250
All right, then.

1420
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:25,875
What are you doing?

1421
02:13:27,167 --> 02:13:28,792
Can't you see?

1422
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:34,250
Where are you going?

1423
02:13:34,417 --> 02:13:35,917
I'm going...

1424
02:13:37,167 --> 02:13:38,333
...to the coast.

1425
02:13:39,083 --> 02:13:41,708
To the seaside,
that's where I'm going.

1426
02:13:43,542 --> 02:13:45,958
How will you get there?

1427
02:13:47,125 --> 02:13:49,417
- Stop that.
- The bus leaves at 11.

1428
02:13:50,792 --> 02:13:52,500
Why do I know that?

1429
02:13:54,583 --> 02:13:57,167
Because I look at the timetables
every week.

1430
02:13:58,292 --> 02:14:00,500
So if you want, come with me

1431
02:14:01,375 --> 02:14:04,125
and I'll buy you a swim trunks
when we get there.

1432
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,208
You know I can't go.

1433
02:14:07,708 --> 02:14:09,750
Stop this nonsense. Rosa!

1434
02:14:12,667 --> 02:14:14,083
Rosa!

1435
02:14:15,083 --> 02:14:16,083
Please, Rosa.

1436
02:14:16,625 --> 02:14:18,125
Don't leave again.

1437
02:14:18,250 --> 02:14:19,250
Rosa!

1438
02:16:04,833 --> 02:16:10,292
to go out
to leave a place and go outside.

1439
02:18:05,458 --> 02:18:06,750
Hello.

1440
02:18:07,708 --> 02:18:08,958
Hello.

1441
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:12,750
Rosa.

1442
02:19:22,667 --> 02:19:24,542
Didn't you catch the bus?

1443
02:19:25,833 --> 02:19:27,167
Looks that way.

1444
02:19:48,083 --> 02:19:49,875
I have to get my ID card.

1445
02:20:23,875 --> 02:20:24,875
Hello.

1446
02:20:25,375 --> 02:20:26,208
Hello.

1447
02:20:26,292 --> 02:20:28,167
Can I help you?

1448
02:20:28,750 --> 02:20:33,125
It turns out we used to live here...

1449
02:20:33,875 --> 02:20:36,500
at least 30 years ago...

1450
02:20:37,125 --> 02:20:39,208
Well, this house was...

1451
02:21:47,917 --> 02:21:51,167
From the publication
of the Decree in 1969,

1452
02:21:51,250 --> 02:21:56,458
more and more cases were revealed
of people who, fearing reprisals,

1453
02:21:56,542 --> 02:21:58,458
went into hiding at home.

1454
02:21:59,833 --> 02:22:03,958
These people were given
the nickname "moles".

1455
02:22:04,042 --> 02:22:09,083
In some cases, they remained in hiding
for over 30 years.
