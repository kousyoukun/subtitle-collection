00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,370
看着我
look at me

148
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,830
你为什么要打那个洞？
Why did you make that hole?

149
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,160
贡萨洛四处张望 什么也没发现
Gonzalo was looking around there and didn't spot a thing

150
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,290
为什么不进去 我们可以治疗你的伤口
Why not get in there, we can treat your wound,

151
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,370
然后我们离开 好吗？
and then we leave. Okay?

152
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,790
请
Please

153
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,540
开始
Come on

154
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,410
这就是方法
That's the way

155
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,830
开始
Come on

156
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,910
隐藏——将某人或某物转移到一个安全的地点或地方
hide - to move somebody or something to a safe location or place

157
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,040
你在做什么?-拿下他们
What are you doing? - Taking them down

158
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,660
他们说所有的窗帘都要放下来
They’ve said that all the curtains have to come down!

159
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:28,450
没有 但是...你搜查了房子 现在又搜查了窗帘
No, but... You searched the house, and now the curtains

160
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,950
我会把它们拿下来 就这样
I'll take them down and that's it

161
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,080
看到了吗？问题解决了
See? Problem solved

162
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,790
贡萨洛 听我说
Gonzalo, listen to me a minute

163
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,500
等一下 停一下 你是知道的
Just a second, stop a minute. You know

164
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,040
也许伊吉尼奥没有用正确的方式做好每一件事
that maybe Higinio didn't do everything the right way,

165
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,790
但是他从不伤害任何人 他不应该在名单上
but he never hurt anyone, he shouldn't be on a list

166
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,330
你了解我们
You know us

167
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,080
嗯 首先他必须出现 然后我们会看到
Well, first he has to turn up, then we'll see

168
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,080
但是我的意思是你可以说这是一个错误
But I mean that you could say it was a mistake,

169
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,160
把他的名字从名单上去掉 -一个错误？
and take his name off the list. - A mistake?

170
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,200
他烧了不该烧的东西 犯了错误 是吗？
He made the mistake when he burnt down what he shouldn't, huh?

171
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,330
烧了什么？
Burnt what?

172
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,700
什么？
What?

173
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,540
巴尔塞纳尔修道院
Barcenillas hermitage,

174
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,040
属于卡梅尔修女 圣斐理伯·奈里 他没说吗？
belongs to the Carmelite nuns, St. Philip Neri, did he not say?

175
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,450
那不是真的 -不是吗？
That isn't true. - Didn't he?

176
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,580
这不是真的 -没有？
It's not true. - No?

177
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,160
他可能有自己的想法 但他不暴力
He may have his ideas, but he's not violent

178
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,950
当他们杀了贡萨洛的兄弟时 他做了什么？
What did he do when they killed Gonzalo's brother?

179
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,700
他什么也没做
He did nothing

180
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,040
对 他什么也没做 什么也没说 他是议员
Right, he didn't do or say anything, and he was a councillor

181
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,250
伊莎贝尔 回家吧
Isabel, go home

182
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,830
不不不我想让她知道
No, no, no. I want her to know

183
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,200
现在她在乞求 但我想让她知道你有多孤独
Now she's begging, but I want her to know how alone you felt

184
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,870
拜托 伊莎贝尔
Please, Isabel

185
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,870
别装无辜 好吗？不要这样做
Don't act the innocent, all right? Don't do it

186
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,750
我们被关了起来 害怕如果我们出去他们会有所行动
We've been locked up afraid they'd do something if we went out

187
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,200
你们都不在乎
And you lot didn't care

188
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,370
如果这些人没来 我丈夫会是下一个
If these people hadn't come, my husband would have been next

189
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,500
好了 够了 得了
Okay, that's enough. Stop it

190
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,870
别管它 走吧 回家
Just stay out of it. Go on, go home

191
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,200
回家吧 女人
Go home, woman

192
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,790
听我说 贡萨洛
Listen to me, Gonzalo

193
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,660
你知道 你很清楚
You know, you know full well,

194
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,450
我们对你哥哥有多难过
how sad we are about your brother

195
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,750
我们一发现 伊吉尼奥就亲自去告诉你了
As soon as we found out, Higinio himself went to tell you that

196
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,450
现在你明白我为什么要做什么了吗？
Now do you understand why I have to do something?

197
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,250
我求你了
I'm begging you please

198
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
你应该对你丈夫说的
You should have said that to your husband

199
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,540
恳求他
Begged him

200
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,040
你应该求他的 对吗？
You should have begged him, right?

201
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,750
来吧 贡萨洛
Come on, Gonzalo

202
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,370
不要拉窗帘 -我要带走他们
Don't take the curtains. - I'm taking them

203
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,080
不要 它们是我的 把窗帘给我
Don't, they're mine. Give me the curtains!

204
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,330
把他们交出来
Hand them over

205
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,790
它们是我的 给我
They're mine, give them to me!

206
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,950
别拿窗帘 贡萨洛
Don't take the curtains, Gonzalo

207
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,540
什么事？搜查雷麦黛丝的房子
What is it? Searching Remedios's house.

208
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,660
“金发男”
”The blond guy”,

209
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,950
和“寨子男”逃走了
and “the stockade guy” got away

210
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,660
你在那里做什么？
What are you doing there?

211
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,750
外面发生了什么？
What's going on outside?

212
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,660
不 这不是重点 我说了什么？
No, that isn't the point. What did I say?

213
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,620
你和谁谈过了吗？
Did you talk to anyone?

214
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,410
帮我个忙 进去吧 -你和谁谈过了吗？
Do me a favour and get in there. - Did you talk to anyone?

215
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,790
阿曼多改变了立场
Armando has switched sides

216
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,950
双胞胎 对吗？
The twin, right?

217
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,500
不 诺加莱斯
No, Nogales

218
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,660
诺加莱斯？
Nogales?

219
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,580
诺加莱斯？
Nogales?

220
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,450
我现在谁都不相信
I don't trust anyone now

221
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
贡萨洛正在分发一份名单
Gonzalo is giving out a list of names

222
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,830
没有什么比愤怒的白痴更糟糕的了
There's nothing worse than an angry idiot

223
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,040
黄油在他嘴里不会融化 现在看看他在胡说八道
Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, now look at him blabbing

224
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,450
他的问题是他害怕
The trouble with him is that he's scared

225
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,540
害怕什么？
Scared of what?

226
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,750
我不知道
I don't know

227
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,500
我们会回来的
That we'll come back

228
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,540
你涂药膏了吗？
Did you put on the ointment?

229
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,540
我完全忘记了药膏
I forgot all about the ointment

230
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,330
小心 小心
Careful, careful

231
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,200
疼吗？
Does it hurt?

232
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,000
我可以忍受
I can put up with it

233
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,790
天啊 你真臭
God, you really stink

234
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
你说我臭是什么意思？-这个
What do you mean I stink? - This

235
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,040
怎么了？它有我的味道
What's wrong? It smells of me

236
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
自从你进去后就没换过
You haven't changed it since you got in there

237
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,330
我为什么要换衬衫？
Why would I change shirts?

238
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,540
我的背真的很痛
My back is really hurting.

239
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,700
我已经能走路了
I can already walk

240
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,370
伊吉尼奥
Higinio

241
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,410
什么？
What?

242
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,700
下周的计划是不可能的
What was planed for the next week is going to be impossible

243
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,370
你怎么能这么说？
How can you say that?

244
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,870
他们逮捕了要带我们去葡萄牙的人
They arrested the man who was going to get us to Portugal

245
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,370
那不可能 罗莎 那不可能
That can't be, Rosa, that can't be

246
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,830
那不可能 -没关系 我会想办法的
That can't be. - It's all right, I'll find a way

247
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,790
我们现在必须离开 我们必须冒这个险
We have to leave now. We have to risk it

248
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,620
我们不能再等了
We can't wait any longer

249
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
现在是时候了
Now is the time

250
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,330
我们现在必须离开 -看在上帝的份上
We must leave now. - For God's sake

251
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,580
放轻松 我会找到办法的
Take it easy, I'll find a way

252
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:39,290
逮捕——法律权威对自由的暂时丧失
arrest - temporary loss of freedom by authority of law

253
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,370
如果你什么都不知道 为什么这么紧张？
If you don't know anything, why so nervous?

254
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,910
我不知道
I don't know

255
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,000
如果你这么晚来我家 你会有什么期待？
What do you expect if you come to my house this late?

256
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,580
你没听说过他 甚至没从别人那里听说过？
You didn't hear about him, not even from someone else?

257
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,830
不 我已经说过了 他走了 这是我最后一次听到
No, I already said I didn't. He left and that was the last I heard

258
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,160
那你为什么这么想把他从名单上抹去？
Then why are you so desperate to have him wiped off the list?

259
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,000
你还没喝够吗？
Haven't you already had enough?

260
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,000
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything

261
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,790
他离开时你说了什么？
What did you say when he left?

262
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,290
没什么 我甚至不能说再见
Nothing, I couldn't even say goodbye

263
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,080
你怎么知道他什么时候离开的？
So how did you know what time he left?

264
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,580
时间 我
The time, I

265
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,410
他早上离开了 但不知道什么时候
He left in the morning, but I don't know at what time

266
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,580
前几天他们看见你在洗一个男人的衬衫
They saw you washing a man's shirt the other day

267
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,580
不要装傻
Don't act stupid

268
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,620
这里没有什么不被注意的
Nothing goes unnoticed here

269
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,950
还是不是你丈夫的？
Or wasn't it your husband's?

270
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,450
是的 它是...这是我丈夫的 但是
Yes, it is... It was my husband's, but

271
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,950
他走后一周 我发现它很脏 所以我就把它洗了
I found it a week after he left, it was dirty so I washed it

272
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,330
你的邻居说你总是开着前门
Your neighbors say you always kept the front door open,

273
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,790
现在它几乎总是关着
now it's almost always shut

274
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,660
正是我所需要的
Just what I needed

275
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,540
别哭了
Quit crying

276
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,950
我说别哭了 好吗？
I said quit crying, okay?

277
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,080
如果你现在不合作 我们有命令要执行
If you don't collaborate now, we have orders to carry out

278
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,540
你瞧...我真的什么都不知道
You see... I really don't know anything

279
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,500
几个问题
A couple of questions

280
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,200
不不不还有问题吗？但是我已经告诉你了
No, no, no, more questions? But I already told you

281
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,790
不求你了 -不要让它变得更难
No, please! - Don't make it more difficult

282
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,330
请不要这样做
Please don't do this!

283
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,580
我什么都不知道 也不知道他在哪里 看在上帝的份上 请不要
I don't know anything or where he is. For God's sake, please don't!

284
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,500
来吧 -我想留在这里
Come on now. - I want to stay here!

285
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,250
我告诉你我什么都不知道
I'm telling you that I don't know anything!

286
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,500
请
Please

287
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,950
他不在吗？
Is he not here?

288
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,370
看起来是这样
Looks that way

289
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,700
我告诉你 我听到噪音 嗯？
I tell you, I hear noises, huh?

290
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,330
你检查过了吗？-哪里？
Did you check there? - Where?

291
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,790
在那里
There

292
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,500
罐子在哪里
Where the jars are

293
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,250
看看里面
Have a look inside

294
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,620
它是空的
It's empty

295
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,830
看起来这里面有点油
Looks like there's a bit of oil in this one

296
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,540
确定吗？
Sure?

297
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,700
这里没人 -没什么？
No one here. - Nothing?

298
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,750
滚开
Scram!

299
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,330
滚开
Scram!

300
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,410
滚开 那不是给你的
Scram, that isn't for you!

301
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,500
给我
Give it to me!

302
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,160
罗莎
Rosa

303
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,290
罗莎
Rosa

304
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,450
他们对你做了什么？
What did they do to you?

305
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,910
发生什么事了？
What happened?

306
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,160
发生什么事了？
What happened?

307
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,620
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

308
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,290
他们告诉我他们抓到你了
They told me that they'd caught you

309
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,080
我一句话也没说
I didn't say a word

310
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,580
结束了 让他们抓住我
It's over. Let them just catch me

311
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,040
如果我连你都照顾不了 为什么我会在这里？
Why am I here if I can't even take care of you?

312
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,410
来这里
Come here

313
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,330
伊吉尼奥
Higinio

314
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,370
什么？
What?

315
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,950
他们告诉我 我必须每天去军营报到
They told me I have to report to the barracks every day

316
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,750
和
And

317
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,370
他们让我把门开着
They've made me leave the front door open

318
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,830
没关系
It's all right

319
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,790
没关系
It's fine

320
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,660
答应我 如果我不在 你不会出来
Promise me you won't come out if I'm not here

321
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,950
答应我
Promise me

322
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,950
发誓
Swear on it

323
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,450
我发誓
I swear

324
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,700
你想象大海是什么样子的？
What do you imagine the sea looks like?

325
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
我不知道
I don't know

326
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,660
贡萨洛来了
Gonzalo is coming.

327
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:21,200
我想象当阳光猛烈照射下来时
I imagine that when the sunlight is shining down hard

328
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,290
我想你
I miss you.

329
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:25,450
它一定像夏天的乡村
it must be like the countryside in summer

330
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,830
太阳与地平线融为一体
and the sun merges with the horizon

331
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
就像那样 但是有水
Like that, but with water

332
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,330
先别走
Don't go yet.

333
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,580
真遗憾
What a pity

334
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:36,950
我爱你
I love you.

335
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,660
我们应该让你父亲支付蜜月费用
We should have let your father pay for the honeymoon

336
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,950
当我们用挣来的钱去做的时候 我们会更享受它
We'll enjoy it more when we do it with the money we earn

337
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,160
你知道今天是星期几吗？
Do you know what day today is?

338
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,540
当然 周年快乐
Of course, happy anniversary.

339
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,790
罗莎
Rosa

340
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,290
以后别忘了适当搅拌骨灰
Don't forget to stir the ashes properly later

341
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,870
好
All right

342
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,580
你已经告诉我三次了
You told me three times already

343
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,250
我向你要的书呢？
What about the books I asked you for?

344
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,910
我不能被看到带着关于政治的书
I can't be seen bringing books on politics

345
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,040
还有那些...很明显他们不适合我
and things that... It's obvious they're not for me

346
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,500
孩子们 过来 你好 -你好
Kids, come here. Hello. - Hello

347
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,290
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

348
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,370
帮我个忙 进去吧
Do me a favour and get in there

349
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,700
你能进去吗？
Can you please get in there?

350
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,620
我在听人们在说什么
I'm listening to what people are saying

351
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,450
我透过窗户偷看的时候看见了佩罗
I saw Pero when I was peeking through the window

352
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,120
他不是站在民族主义阵营的前线吗？
Wasn't he on the front with the Nationalist faction?

353
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,540
要么他有一个双胞胎兄弟 要么他在外面庆祝胜利
Either he has a twin brother or he's out there celebrating the victory

354
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,080
罗莎
Rosa

355
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,660
结束了吗？
Is it over?

356
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,200
你为什么不告诉我？
So why don't you tell me?

357
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,290
因为还没有结束
Because it isn't over

358
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,580
他们处决了阿里纳斯
They executed Arenas

359
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,910
恩里克 安德烈斯 奎约
And Enrique, Andrés, Quijo

360
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,250
他们杀了所有被抓的议员
They killed all the councillors that they caught

361
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,450
他们已经悬赏捉拿你
They've put out a reward for your capture

362
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,370
我听说他们出价6万比塞塔
I heard they're offering 60,000 pesetas

363
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,370
我做了什么才值那么多钱？
What have I done to be worth that much?

364
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,330
我不知道 他们说你做了可怕的事情
I don't know, they're saying you did terrible things

365
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,950
谁说的？-每个人
Who's saying that? - Everyone

366
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,410
那些从前面回来的人
Those coming back from the front

367
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,000
他们责怪你们中没有回来的人
they are blaming those of you who didn't come back

368
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,750
所以 还没有结束
So, it isn't over

369
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:56,750
危险——可能发生坏事的风险或迫在眉睫的可能性
danger - risk or imminent possibility that something bad may occur

370
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,910
你觉得她知道些什么吗？
Think she knows something?

371
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,450
我也这么认为她在隐瞒什么
I think so. She's hiding something

372
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,870
我们必须审问她 尽我们所能
We have to interrogate her, get as much as we can

373
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,330
在这里审问她 -我不同意
Interrogate her right here. - I don't agree

374
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,410
我们带她一起去吧 审问她和其他什么
Let's take her with us. Interrogate her and whatever else

375
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,080
不 不可能 听我说
No, no way. Listen to me

376
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,750
我们照我说的做 在这里审问她
We do as I say, interrogate her here

377
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,000
你在大喊大叫
You're shouting

378
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,500
会再发生的 等着瞧吧
It'll happen again, just wait and see

379
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,620
自从战争结束后 他变得更加着迷
Since the war ended he's become even more obsessed

380
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
罗莎
Rosa!

381
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,450
贡萨洛 我是伊吉尼奥 我的岳父 我们在吃饭 好吗？
Gonzalo, It’s Higinio, my father-in-law. We are having dinner, okay?

382
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,540
行
Okay

383
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,790
每天都一样
Same thing every day

384
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,370
那么 伊吉尼奥没事吧？
So, is Higinio all right?

385
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,660
他没事
He's all right

386
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,950
但是这越来越让人无法忍受了
But this is getting unbearable

387
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,290
他开始在睡梦中大喊大叫
He's beginning to shout in his sleep

388
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,660
前几天他们把这个地方翻了个底朝天
They turned the place upside down the other day

389
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,830
我不知道他们怎么没找到他
I don't know how they didn't find him

390
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,870
你是说他在这里？
You mean he's here?

391
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
他在那里
He's there

392
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,660
罐子下面
Under the jars

393
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,950
他藏在里面
He's hiding inside there

394
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,660
亲爱的上帝
Dear God

395
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,330
他在那里已经三年了
He's been there three years

396
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,500
几乎
Pretty much

397
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,200
如果你愿意 把架子上的盘子拿来 说几句话
If you want, fetch the plates on the shelf and have a word

398
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,120
请帮我把那些盘子拿来
Do me a favour and fetch me those plates, please

399
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,330
父亲
Father

400
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,790
从架子上拿些东西 任何东西
Pick something off the shelf, anything

401
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,080
但是你为什么不跟我说点什么？
But why didn't you say anything to me?

402
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,750
我们认为最好不要告诉任何人
We thought it was best not to tell anyone

403
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,330
父亲 我需要你的帮助
Father, I need your help

404
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,700
你想要什么都行
Whatever you want

405
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,000
餐具柜所在的墙
The wall where the sideboard is

406
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,500
我需要你建一堵假墙
I need you to build a false wall,

407
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,500
然后在餐具柜后面挖一个洞
and then make a hole behind the sideboard

408
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,910
你想藏在那里吗？
You want to hide in there?

409
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,200
是
Yes

410
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,750
你的房子更安全
Your house is safer

411
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,370
罗莎会给你看计划
Rosa will show you the plans

412
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,870
你建墙越快越好
The sooner you build the wall, the better

413
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,830
一旦准备好了 伊吉尼奥就会去那里
As soon as it's ready, Higinio will go there

414
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,870
你呢？
What about you?

415
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,000
i...如果你不介意的话
I... If you don't mind,

416
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,080
我会和你一起住
I'd move in with you

417
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,660
如果人们问 我们会告诉他们钱很紧
If people ask, we tell them that money is really tight and

418
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,950
这样我就可以管理你已故妻子的工作室
that way I can take charge of your deceased wife's workshop

419
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,410
快
Quick

420
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,370
记得用茴香和熏衣草来清理这个洞以去除气味
Remember to clean the hole with anise and lavender to get rid of the smell

421
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,540
行
Okay

422

455
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,000
我迷路了

在你的村子里？-是的

如果你需要什么...-安静
If you need anything... - Silence!

465
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,870
沉默
Silence

466
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,160
这正是我需要的
That's what I need

467

将人或动物放在他们不能离开的地方

468
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,910
我在兵营旁边的广场上看见了他
I saw him in the square, next to the barracks

469
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,330
他难过得无法和儿子说再见

470
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,200
现在他离开了这个世界 再也不能

471
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,910
让我们上路吧

472
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,790
1944年2月8日

我有三袋土 你知道吗？

我会一直挖到树林

伊吉尼奥 我想要个孩子

479
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,080
别再这样了 罗莎
Not this again, Rosa

480
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,080
我们不是说过盟军何时赢得战争吗？
Didn't we say when the allies won the war?

481
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,080
那会是什么时候？他们什么时候会赢？
And when will that be? When will they win?

482
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,250
当我不能再有孩子的时候？
When I can't have children anymore?

When my belly starts showing, I'll go to Granada

484
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,620

Then I'll say it's a nephew I have to take care of

485
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,500
同时 我如何生存？
Meanwhile, how do I survive?

486
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,410
我会给你留下食物和你需要的任何东西

487
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,370
你能听到自己吗？

你没意识到这很荒谬而且很危险吗？
Don't you realise it's absurd and really dangerous?

489
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:38,540
你知道他们会杀了你、我和孩子吗？
Do you realise they could kill you, me and the baby?

490
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,250
你知道会发生什么吗？
Do you realise what might happen?

491

让我们开动脑筋 是拯救的时候了

让我们用我们的头脑

494

让我们给盟友一些时间

503
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,040
走向法国的心脏

504
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,410
伸出你的手臂

一个来自科尔多瓦的有趣女孩

这让我爱上了她
It's what made me fall in love with her

527
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,290
那时情况不同

528
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,500
因为几个月来
Because for a few months now,

529
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,910
她看起来总是很悲伤
she always looks sad

530
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,540
好像她对什么都不感兴趣
Like she's not excited about anything

531
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:43,790
现在她所做的就是吃东西
Now all she does is eat

532
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,950
她只吃东西 从不出门
All she does is eat, never leaves the house

533
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,000
我说 卡门 让我们去节日 让你自己漂亮
I say, Carmen, let's go to the festival, make yourself pretty

534
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,330
让我们穿上色彩鲜艳的衣服...
A colourful dress, let's...

535
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:57,910
充分利用节日 -像以前一样

她觉得不能胜任
She doesn't feel up to it

537
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,950
她现在不一样了
She's not the same now

538
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,450
可怜的东西
Poor thing

539
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,000
也许我匆忙结婚了
Maybe I rushed into getting married

540
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,370
别这么说 罗德里戈
Don't say that, Rodrigo

541
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:18,660
这些事情需要时间 需要习惯
These things take time, they take getting used to

542
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,410
为什么是那张脸？
Why that face?

543
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,040
什么脸？
What face?

那张脸
That face

545
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,790
什么脸？
What face?

546
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,500
你笑了 不是吗？
You smiled, didn't you?

547
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,500
看到我充满疑虑 你觉得好笑吗？
Do you find it funny to see me full of doubts?

548
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,160
不 反过来
No, it's the other way around

549
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,790
我为你们俩感到难过
I feel sad for both of you

550
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,500
不管怎样 我不知道
Anyway, I don't know

551
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,160
这里还有一个洞
There's another hole here, too

552
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,540
又一个？-是的
Another one? - Yes

553
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,660
我没见过那个
I hadn't seen that one

554
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,790
那是星期天的
That's from Sunday

555
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:10,040
我会帮你修好的 我会把它盖住 这样你就看不见了
I'll mend that for you. I'll cover it up so you won't see it

556
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,040
我知道你和我有同样的感觉
I know you feel the same way as I do

557
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,330
什么意思？
How do you mean?

558
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,910
停下 停下
Stop, stop

559
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,700
我说停下
I said stop!

560
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,120
罗莎
Rosa

561
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,120
马上滚出我的房子
Get out of my house right now

562
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,500
我告诉过你马上出去 否则我会开始尖叫
I told you to get out right now or I'll start screaming

563
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,700
松懈
Take it easy

564
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,700
我要走了
I'm leaving

565
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,660
懦夫
Coward

566
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,950
这是可耻的
It's shameful

567
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,750
这是可耻的
It's shameful

568
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,790
懦夫
Coward

569
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,160
真的 这是可耻的
Really, it's shameful

570
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,000
你以为我不知道你在那里吗
Do you think I don't know you're there

571
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,950
看吗？
watching?

572
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,660
你看到了 对吧？
You saw it, right?

573
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:40,910
我在和你说话
I'm talking to you

574
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,330
看看他会对我做什么？
See what he was going to do to me?

575
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,120
什么也别做
Don't do a thing

576
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,950
呆在那里 都关在里面
Just stay there, all shut in

577
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,000
像虫子一样 像懦夫一样
Like a worm, like a coward

578
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,500
就好像你已经死了一样
It's as if you were dead already!

579
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,120
罗莎求你了 -罗莎 什么？
Rosa, please. - Rosa, what?

580
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,330
每个人都会听到你 -如果他们听到我 我在乎什么？
Everyone will hear you. - What do I care if they hear me?

581
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,080
你不在这里 是吗？
You're not here, are you?

582
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,200
是吗？
Are you?

583
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,910
这里有人吗？
Is there somebody here?

584
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:22,250
我在问你
I'm asking you

585
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,950
如果你在这里
if you're here

586
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,950
你不在这里
You're not here

587
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:31,500
我很孤独
I'm all alone

588
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:38,000
你不是男人 丈夫 父亲 你什么都不是 我一个人
You're not a man, a husband, a father, you're nothing. I'm alone

589
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,250
你是谁？
Who are you?

590
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,950
进去看看你的垃圾小说 关上门
Get in there and read your trashy novels, and shut the door!

591
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,290
父亲
Father?

592
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,750
罗莎 有人在吗？
Rosa! Anyone there?

593
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:06,200
在这里干吗？请离开
What are you doing here? Please leave

594
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,450
不 让我解释一下
No, let me explain

595
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,620
在过去的几天里 我一直在思考发生了什么
In the last few days I've been thinking a lot about what happened

596
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,120
除了向你道歉
As well as apologising to you,

597
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,870
我想恢复我们的职业关系
I'd like to regain our professional relationship

598
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:24,250
我认为这有点失控了
I think that this got a little out of hand

599
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:31,160
我给你带来这件外套要缝 因为袖子撕破了
I brought you this coat to sew, because the sleeves are torn

600
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,370
还有口袋
and the pockets

601
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,660
请放在那里 然后离开
Please put it there and leave

602
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,200
你不想谈谈发生了什么吗？
Don't you want to talk about what happened?

603
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,950
罗莎 够了
Rosa, that's enough

604
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:47,950
剪刀
The scissors!

605
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:50,950
抓住他们
Grab them!

606
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,620
在那里
There

607
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,410
我杀了他吗？
Did I kill him?

608
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,950
我杀了他吗？
Did I kill him?

609
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,910
我想离开
I want to leave

610
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,290
我想离开
I want to leave

611
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,200
罗莎 求你了 我们不能
Rosa, please, we can't

612
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,410
如果他们找到他 他们会杀了我们
If they find him, they'll kill us

613
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:25,450
我们必须把他藏起来 除掉他 然后再决定怎么做
We have to hide him and get rid of him, then we'll decide what to do

614
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,870
好吗？
Okay?

615
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:30,950
别担心
Don't worry

616
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,040
我的床垫着火了
My mattress was on fire

617
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:50,870
这就是为什么我花了这么长时间
That's why I took so long

618
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,160
我认为这里需要大量的泥土
I think that a lot of dirt is going to be needed here

619
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,950
下午好 罗莎 -你好
Good afternoon, Rosa. - Hello

620
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,870
这位年轻女士正在敲你老房子的门
This young lady was knocking on the door of your old house

621
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:23,660
我出来告诉她你至少有五年没在那里住了
I came out and told her you hadn't lived there for at least five years

622
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,500
我被给错了地址
I was given the wrong address

623
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,250
这是玛丽·卡门
This is Mari Carmen,

624
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,160
失踪的国民警卫队成员罗德里戈的妻子
the wife of Rodrigo, the civil guard who went missing

625
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,330

我正在参观他过去常去的地方 以防有人知道什么
I'm visiting places he used to go in case somebody knows something

628
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:40,750
他的同事告诉我他把公司制服带来了
His colleagues told me he brought the company uniforms here

629
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,000
这样你就能修补它们
so that you would mend them

630
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:45,000
是的 有时他给我带东西
Yes, sometimes he brought me things

631
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,370
谢谢你和我一起去贡萨洛 你真是太好了
Thank you for coming with me Gonzalo. It was very kind of you

632
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,950
你介意我单独和她说话吗？
Would you mind if I spoke to her alone?

633
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,540
不客气 为您服务
Not at all, at your service

634
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,200
好吧 再见
All right, goodbye

635
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,450

是的 当然
Yes, of course

637
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,450
我想我帮不了你多少忙
I don't think I'll be able to help you very much

638
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,410
对不起
Sorry

639
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,870
对不起 但是
I'm sorry, but

640
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,450
我知道你也失去了你的丈夫
I know that you lost your husband, too

641
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,830
也许你可以告诉我
Maybe you could tell me

642
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,120
我应该做什么 因为
what I should do, because

643
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,660
我感到失落
I feel lost

644
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:46,080
放轻松 我去给你拿点水
Take it easy. I'll fetch you some water

645
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,410
这是我丈夫的
This belonged to my husband

646
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,450
你瞧
You see

647
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,080
他留给我修理袖子
He left it for me to mend the sleeve,

648
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:45,160
但是发生了这么多事情 我忘记了我拥有它
but what with everything that happened, I forgot that I had it

649
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,500
仍然有他的味道
It still smells of him

650
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,200
如果你愿意 我今天晚上可以修理它
If you want, I can mend it this evening

651
01:08:58,540 --> 01:08:59,950
明天给你
And give it to you tomorrow

652
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,290
显然 我不会收费
Obviously, I won't charge

653
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:11,950
下午
Afternoon

654
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,080
我见到了佛朗哥将军
I saw General Franco

655
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:28,540
哪里？
Where?

656
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,330
在电影上映前的新闻短片中
In the newsreel they showed before the film

657
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,000
他听起来不像一个领导者
He doesn't sound like a leader

658
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,830
他听起来不像一个领导者？
He doesn't sound like a leader?

659
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,870
他听起来像什么？
So, what does he sound like?

660
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,450
这是什么意思？
What does that mean?

661
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,700
他的声音有点
Well, his voice is sort of

662
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:52,160
非常温柔 就像
very gentle, like

663
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:53,950
不太喜欢
Like nothing much

664
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,700
当我们在收音机里听到他时 你说他让你害怕
When we listen to him on the radio you say that he scares you

665
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,750
因为我意识到如果你只听他的 不看他 好吗
Because I've realised that if you only listen to him and don't see him, okay

666
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,660
但是如果你看到他说话 你会说
But if you see him talking, you say

667
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,750
他看起来像一个乔装打扮的女人
He looks like a woman in disguise

668
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,160
上帝 罗莎

It's true

是真的 他看起来不像
It's true, he doesn't look

671
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:22,370
他的身体和一个
His body doesn't match that of a head of

672
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:28,410
有些人试图
There are those who have tried to

673
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,410
推测当前的困难
speculate about current difficulties,

674
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,660
好像它们不是其他世代留给我们的东西
as if they were not something other generations bequeathed us

675
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,660
今天的所有困难都源于过去的西班牙
All of today's difficulties stem from the Spain of the past

676
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:43,950
尽管有这些困难 今天西班牙已经重生
In spite of these difficulties, today Spain has been reborn,

677
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:46,370

678

What's this?

679
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,330
我们在庆祝什么？
What are we celebrating?

680
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,080
我在期待
I'm expecting

682
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

683
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:42,700
为什么我不能确定？
Why wouldn't I be sure?

684
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:52,040
罗莎 你确定这是...？-希吉尼奥

这是我们的孩子 我们要生了 我不想再谈这个了
It's our baby and we're having it. I don't want to talk about it anymore

688
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,160
为什么不呢...？
Why not...?

指国家、国家、军队等 ,

but we'll be able to talk about it soon

697
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,290
我等不及要见到你 给你一个拥抱 我爱你
I can't wait to see you and give you a hug, I love you

来这里

707

If you know the owner isn't here, why do you leave her post?

708
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:32,580
你在那里做什么？他们会看到你的
What are you doing there? They'll see you

709
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,500
此时外面没有人
There's no one outside at this time

710
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,120
不要在这里抽烟

711
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,250
你真的很蠢 是吧？

放开我
Get off me

715
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,200
你为什么这么紧张？
Why do you get so uptight?

716
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:52,790
我不紧张
I don't get uptight

717
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,660
是的 你知道
Yes, you do

718
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:56,950
就像我不小心碰到你的手
Like when I accidentally brush against your hand

719
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,040
是的 是故意的

720
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,080

I'm just a bit cautious, whereas you're irresponsible

721
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,910
告诉我一些事
Tell me something

722
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:12,250
如果他们向你保证

没人会因为当众吻我而说什么
that no one would say anything for kissing me in public,

724
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:16,950
你会做吗？
would you do it?

725
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:21,750

729

730

糟糕 -等等 等等
Crap. - Wait, wait

737
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:52,370
没关系
It's okay

738
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,540
把它放在那里
Leave it there

739
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,080
胡说 -妈的

Is it broken?

741

别管它 走吧
Leave it. Let's go

742
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:29,620

745
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,450
外面的情况怎么样？
How are things on the outside?

746
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:00,950
什么？-世界大战

盟军 他们怎么样了？

我认为这场战争永远不会结束

754
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:22,540
请不要告诉任何人

755

帮我个忙 别说废话
Do me a favour and don't talk rubbish

756

757
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,290
我刚刚出现在你们两个面前

758
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:30,770
但是也不要告诉你的妻子

759
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:33,120
这里没人会说什么 好吗？
No one is going to say anything here, okay?

760
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:36,410
既然你提到了罗莎
Now that you mentioned Rosa,

761
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,500
直到她回到这里
until she gets back here,

762
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,450
你会一周两次给我带来美味的炖肉
you'll bring me a nice stew twice a week

763
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,620
我能吃下一匹马
I could eat a horse

764
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,950
当你来的时候

好吗？

好吧 -好吧
All right. - All right

770
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,790
明显
Obviously

771
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:18,000
犯了错误 否则我们就不会处于这种情况
mistakes were made or else we wouldn't be in this situation

772
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,000
但是在共和党时期做了一些好事
But some good things were done in the Republican period

773
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:24,500
例如 立法重新分配土地

774
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,040
教人们读写 医疗保健

确保每个人都能得到治疗

776
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:31,950
这是人权问题

777
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,950
这一切都可以实现
That can all be achieved

778
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,750
人们应该有体面的生活

779
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:39,910
你不这样认为吗？

780
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,250
我不参与那些事情

没有任何东西
Nothing

783
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,410
这就是该政权所取得的成就

784

确保人们不会思考

785
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,870
想象你所说的发生了

786
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:07,290
盟军赢得了战争 他们将佛朗哥赶下台
the Allies win the War and they oust Franco from power

787
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,040
你会怎么做？
What would you do?

788
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:12,330
熄灭
Go out

789
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,080
在街上庆祝
Out on the street to celebrate

790
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,750

01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:18,000
就这样？
Just like that?

792
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,620
这还不够吗？
Isn't that enough?

793
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,080
继续为我所说的而奋斗
And keep on fighting for what I said

794
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,500
你能告诉每个人我是什么吗？
And will you tell everyone what I am?

795
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,950
我是一个守信的人
I'm a man of my word

796
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,950
但你还是会拉长着脸看着我
But you'd still look at me with a long face

797
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:43,000
盟军不会改变这一点
The Allies won't change that

798
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:45,290
或者其他人
Or anyone else

799
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,660
我不能改变的是你脑子里在想什么
What I can't change is what goes on in your head

800
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:50,910
我认为是我的事
What I think is my business

801
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:56,410

如果罗莎还没回来 现在不会太久了
If Rosa hasn't come back yet. It can't be long now

807
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,080
不管怎样 你都可以来
Well, you can come anyway

808
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:18,660
你将如何向她解释？

809
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,540
我不知道

Fifteen years hanging out with her and you're not going to tell me?

1029

解释什么...-你解释

我是你丈夫

1048
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,250
我受够了 希吉尼奥 -什么？

被关起来？那是我
Of being cooped up? That's me

厌倦了这样的生活 我受不了了
Sick of living this way, I can't take it

厌倦了对街上的每个人撒谎

1053
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:05,580

And me? I don't see the light of day. Twenty years cooped up

你把我关了20年

有一个快速的解决方案

1062
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:30,120
被锁在那个破洞里
Locked up in that shitty hole

1063
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:32,290
那我来为你开门

住手 -不 出去

我再也受不了你了
I can't stand you anymore

1067
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:48,870
你甚至不能出去
You're not even capable of going out

1068
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:51,870
你做不到 那是你的问题
You can't do it, that's your problem

1069
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:55,370
好 好 好
Well, well, well

1070
01:41:57,370 --> 01:42:00,700
我们这么做是为了能在一起 对吗？
We did all of this so we could be together, right?

1071
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,080
看看我们在一起有多好
Well look how together we are

1072
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:09,910
你弄坏了我的东西
You've broken my things

1073
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,620

1075
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:48,870
他迟到了 这就是为什么我没有告诉你
He got in late. That's why I didn't tell you

1076
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,370
他告诉我大海是什么样的
He told me what the sea is like

1077
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,870
告诉你爸爸 -是的
Tell your dad. - Yeah

1078
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:57,250
我告诉她它是咸的
I was telling her that it's salty

1079
01:42:57,410 --> 01:43:00,040
但不像你在里面放了盐
But not like you've added salt to it

1080
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:02,370
一个波浪打在我的脸上
A wave hit me in the face,

1081
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:07,160
它闻起来像新鲜的鱼或者类似的东西

1082
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,660
温度会变化

1083
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:13,580

1084
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:17,660
你呆在同一个地方 但还有另一层温暖
You stay in the same place, but there's another warm layer

1085
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,620
听起来不错
Sounds nice

1086
01:43:21,410 --> 01:43:25,040
海底很奇怪 就像陆地一样 但是
And the seabed is strange, it's like the land but

1087
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:27,660
全是沙子
it's all sand

1088
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,540
它是什么颜色的？
What colour is it?

1089
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,620
深蓝
Dark blue

1090
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:36,000
在其他地方它看起来是绿色的
And it looks greenish in other places

1091
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:39,250
好像它在动 蓝色是
As if it were moving. The blue is

1092
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,410
混入
mixed in with

1093
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:43,580
用白色
with white

1094
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,830
改变——改变外貌、状况或行为
to change - to modify appearance, condition or behaviour

1095
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:10,750

乐观地面对1963年

1097
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,910

Sorry I couldn't let you know before, but he's in a fix and needs help

1108
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,250

见到你很高兴

Twenty-five years keeping it a secret that I'm here,

1111
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,450
现在因为你认为事情正在改变
and now because you think things are changing,

1112
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:16,370
你告诉一个朋友你爸爸藏在这里？

只是几天而已

你不能表现出一些团结吗？

你的战斗精神呢？

1116
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:39,660

1157

你在开玩笑

你应该感到羞耻 -现在出去

他藏在那里

They're hiding Higinio Blanco here, a war criminal

1281
02:01:28,830 --> 02:01:31,410

That's a lie. - He was sentenced in the year

1282

我们是为了一扇破门而来的
We're here about a broken door

1284

我刚到家

我发现他完全喝醉了 在我家

我不知道他来这里偷什么

后门被打碎了

是你做的吗？-坚持住
Did you do that? - Hang on

1291

我不是小偷 我不是来偷东西的
I'm no thief, I didn't come here to steal

1292
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:59,000

I'm telling you that a war criminal is hiding here: Higinio Blanco

你破门而入了吗？

但这是什么？
But what is this?

1297

你没看见他有酒精的味道吗？

你们两个 马上去车站
Both of you, down to the station now!

两者都有？我把我知道的都告诉你了 -我什么也没做
Both? I told you all I know. - I didn't do anything

1304
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,540
你应该看看里面
You should look in there

1305

不 他们也不会
No, and they won't, either

1312
02:03:01,410 --> 02:03:04,080
发生什么事了？-他们让他为门付钱
What happened? - They made him pay for the door

1313
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:06,160

他在车站说了什么？

你怎么想呢?
What do you think?

1317
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:19,540
任何古老的谎言 我不知道
Any old lie, I don't know

1318
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:23,450
他说你是个告密者
He said you were an informer

1319
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:25,660
你举报了邻居

你举报了他的兄弟 所以他们会杀了他

1322
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:35,450
这是真的还是假的？
Is it true or not?

1323

1325

我受够了
I'm sick of this

1326
02:03:50,410 --> 02:03:53,950
如果我必须保护你 我有权知道你是谁
If I have to protect you, I deserve to know who you are

1327
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:55,950
你做了什么
and what you've done

1328
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:01,450
如果你什么都没做 你在那里呆了30年是不正常的
It's not normal that you've been there 30 years if you didn't do anything

1329
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:04,250
杰米...-不要再从这个开始了
Jaime... - Don't start with this again

1330

我从小就害怕
I've been terrified since I was a kid,

1332
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:13,370
测量每个手势 看 对每个人撒谎

说我妈妈是我阿姨 我不认识我爸爸
saying my mother is my aunt and I don't know my father,

1334
02:04:16,830 --> 02:04:20,790
事实上他住在我房子的墙后
when in fact he lived behind a wall in my house,

1335
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:22,950
像这样躲在那里

1336
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,040
你不觉得羞耻吗？这是我的房子

什么房子？不在这里

那是你的房子 你住在那里
That's your house, you live there

1340
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:37,620
懦夫躲起来 而其他人在前线战斗并死去
Cowards who hid away while the others fought and died on the front

1341
02:04:37,870 --> 02:04:41,000
在我们继续生活的时候 我不得不躲在墙后
have to live behind a wall while our lives go on

1342
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:44,500
请小声点 -谁在听？
Lower your voice, please. - Who's listening?

1343
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:46,750
邻居？-他们能听到你
The neighbors? - They can hear you

1344
02:04:46,870 --> 02:04:49,370
他们从一开始就知道他在那里
They've known he's there from the beginning

1345
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:51,950
路易莎告诉我她听到他在睡梦中大喊大叫
Luisa told me she hears him shouting in his sleep

1346
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
那不是真的 -想象他的梦
That's not true. - Imagine his dreams

1347
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:58,290
她的父母认为他被关了这么久已经疯了
Her parents think he's gone mad from being locked up so long

1348
02:04:58,450 --> 02:05:00,500

总是谈论战斗
Always talking about fighting

1350
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:05,700
你的战斗方式毫无意义
Your way of fighting meant nothing

1351
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:08,410
一个没有勇气出去的懦夫
A coward who doesn't have the balls to go outside

1352
02:05:08,830 --> 02:05:11,160

外面没人等着吃你活着
There's no one out there waiting to eat you alive

1356
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:39,450
我在警察局

甚至国民警卫队也不感兴趣

1358
02:06:04,370 --> 02:06:06,410
伊吉尼奥 -什么？

1359

你认为这个小伙子是对的吗？

待在这里是一回事
Being in here is one thing,

02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:28,580
晚安 -晚安

1366
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:04,910
谁在那里？
Who's there?

1367
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:43,660
慢慢地挖掘我 嗯？
Took your time digging me up, huh?

1368

请把烟咽下去 它有气味

真的很干

你真的很勇敢 伊吉尼奥

勇敢到连自己的生命都不要去拿

我想你已经听腻了

1376
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:34,660
但是很少有人会容忍你的正直

谢谢

Maybe your fear won't make people see you as a hero

1379
02:08:49,450 --> 02:08:52,160
但是你也因此成为了受害者
But you're no less a victim because of it

1380

谢谢
