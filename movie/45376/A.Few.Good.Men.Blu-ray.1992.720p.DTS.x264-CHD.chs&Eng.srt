1
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,480
古巴 关达那摩湾 美国海军基地

2
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,240
<i><b><font color=#FFFF80>义海雄风</b></i>

3
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,460
齐步走！
Forward march!

4
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,970
我请求
I'm requesting...

5
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,180
上校，我想请求由我担任律师
Captain, I'd like to request that it be me who's the attorney...

6
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,020
这是我自己决定的
That it be myself who's assigned.

7
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,940
不行，我想请求指任我作
No, I'd like to request that it be I who am assigned...

8
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,650
“这是我的决定”？
"That it be I who am assigned"?

9
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,070
这样不错，显得信心十足
That's good. That's confidence-inspiring.

10
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,030
措辞也很得体
Good grammar there.

11
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,280
上校，我想请求指任我为律师
Captain, I'd like to request...

12
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,950
上校，我想请求指任我为律师
<font size=18 color=#9B9BFF>华盛顿哥伦比亚特区  法务总监办事处
that I be the attorney assigned.

13
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,580
嗨，我是盖洛维少校，来这见威斯特上校
I'm Lieutenant Commander Galloway here to see Captain West.

14
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,540
快进去吧，少校，他们正等着你
Go right in, Commander. They're expecting you.

15
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,040
谢谢
Thank you.

16
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,550
乔，快进来 谢谢，长官
Jo, come on in. Thank you, sir.

17
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,640
威斯特上校，这就是盖洛维少校
Captain West, this is Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

18
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,060
乔，你认识劳伦斯少校吧？ 是的，长官
Jo, you know Commander Lawrence. Yes, sir.

19
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,270
上校，很感谢你这么快就接见我
Captain, I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.

20
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,940
干嘛不坐下？ 不用，长官
Would you like to sit down? I'm fine, sir.

21
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,480
坐吧 好的
Have a seat. Okay.

22
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,730
我听说上周末在古巴出了麻烦是吧？
I understand we had some trouble over the weekend down in Cuba?

23
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,110
是的，长官，上周五有两名海军陆战队员
Yes, sir. This past Friday, two Marines...

24
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,160
准下士哈罗德・道森 和一等兵劳登・多尼
a Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and a Private Louden Downey...

25
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,410
进入一等兵威廉・圣地亚哥的营房 并殴打了他
entered the barracks room of a P.F.C. William Santiago and assaulted him.

26
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,000
大约一小时后圣地亚哥在基地医院身亡
Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later.

27
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,580
负责给道森和多尼录取口供 的海军调查处官员…
The N.I.S. Agent who took Dawson and Downey's statements...

28
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,960
认定他们是想试图阻止圣地亚哥…
maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago...

29
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,880
举报道森在界线上的开枪事件
from naming Dawson in a fenceline shooting incident.

30
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,720
已安排今天下午四点 在基地举行一次听证会
They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba this afternoon at 16:00.

31
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,680
问题在哪？ 道森和多尼…
What's the problem? Dawson and Downey...

32
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,100
都是模范海军陆战队员 而圣地亚哥是有名的落后分子
are both recruiting poster Marines, and Santiago was known to be a screwup.

33
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,980
我猜这多半是一次“红色条规”
I was thinking it sounded an awful lot like a Code Red.

34
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,270
老天
Christ.

35
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,070
长官，我希望将他们移交华盛顿 并为他们指派一名
Sir, I'd like to have them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel...

36
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,400
能认真调查此事
someone who can really look into this...

37
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,860
不仅精通法律技巧…
someone who possesses not only the legal skill...

38
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,870
而且熟知军队内部运作方式的律师
but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military.

39
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,450
简而言之，上校，我提议…
In short, Captain, I'd like to suggest that...

40
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,450
由我来担任
I be the one who that...

41
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,670
指派我作他们的辩护律师
that it be me who is assigned to represent them... myself.

42
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,300
盖洛维少校，你要不要来杯咖啡？
Commander Galloway, why don'tyou get yourself a cup of coffee?

43
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,380
谢谢，长官，不用
Thank you, sir. I'm fine.

44
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,640
我希望你能回避一下好让我们私下谈谈
I'd like you to leave the room so we can talk about you behind your back.

45
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
没问题，长官
Certainly, sir.

46
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,480
我还以为再也不会有什么“红色条规”了
I thought this Code Red shit wasn't going on anymore.

47
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,650
海军远在关达那摩 谁知道在那有些什么鬼事？
With the Marines at Gitmo, who knows what the hell goes on down there?

48
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,690
我们最好在其他人知道之前查清楚
We better find out before the rest of the world does.

49
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,780
这种鬼事有可能弄得无法收拾
Damn thing could get messy.

50
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,410
好吧，这个盖洛维少校怎么样？
All right, what about this Commander Galloway?

51
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,620
她在内政部担任文职人员…
She's been working a desk in Internal Affairs...

52
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,580
有一年多了
for a little over a year now.

53
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,670
之前呢？ 两年内办过三个案子
Before that? Disposed of three cases in two years.

54
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,580
两年三件案子？罗森博格叛国案吗？
Three cases in two years? Who's she handling, the Rosenbergs?

55
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,170
她不适合做首席律师 但绝对是个好调查员
She's not cut out for litigation. She's a hell of an investigator.

56
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,760
她在内政部协助律师工作非常尽力
In Internal Affairs she can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best of them.

57
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,680
但到了庭讯的时候 我知道，心有余而力不足
But when it comes to trial work... I know. All passion, no street smarts.

58
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,640
叫她进来吧
Bring her back in.

59
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,110
少校，我们明早就将被告转到这里来
Commander, we're gonna have the defendants moved up here in the morning.

60
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,360
谢谢，长官 师部会给他们指派律师
Thankyou, sir. Division will assign them counsel.

61
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,790
但…不是我 根据你的同事对你的评价…
But not me. From what I get from your colleagues...

62
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,200
由你担任此事太过大材小用…
you're much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted...

63
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,330
我相信此案无非是几分钟的庭辩…
in what I'm sure will boil down to a five-minute plea bargain...

64
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,330
以及一个礼拜的文书工作
and a week's worth of paperwork.

65
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,540
长官，我想恐怕没这么简单
Sir, I think there might be more involved than that.

66
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,050
别担心
Don't worry about it.

67
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,050
我保证师部会为此指派合适的人选
I promise you Division will assign the right man for the job.

68
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,430
好了，来吧，拿下二垒
All right. Let's go. Let's get two.

69
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,220
抱歉 用不着抱歉，切比
Sorry. Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.

70
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,470
你只要把球接住就行
You just look the ball into your glove.

71
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,930
第二投
Shooting two.

72
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,730
对不起 你得相信我，切比
Sorry. You gotta trust me, Sherby.

73
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,570
你只要集中精神就能提高接住的成功率
Keep your eyes open, your chances of catching it increase by a factor often.

74
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,480
凯菲 我们再试试
Kaffee. Let's try it again.

75
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,650
戴维，你精神失常吗？
Dave, you seem distraught.

76
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,490
麦德摩的案子 我们约好在十五分钟前会面的
We were supposed to meet 15 minutes ago about the McDermott case.

77
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,280
你是在拖延时间，现在我们马上着手…
You're stalling on this thing. Now we either do it now...

78
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,950
不然我就把你的当事人送上他妈的绞架
or, no kidding, Kaffee, I'm gonna hang your boy from a fucking yardarm!

79
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,000
绞架？切比，海军还在用绞架行刑吗？
Yardarm? Sherby, does the Navy still hang people from yardarms?

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,460
我看不会
I don't think so.

81
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,920
戴维，切比认为海军不会再采用绞刑
Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy hangs people from yardarms anymore.

82
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,340
我要指控他藏毒并在值勤期间吸毒
I'm gonna charge him with possession and being under the influence on duty.

83
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,600
你劝他认罪的话 我可以建议判他三十天监禁
You plead guilty, I'll recommend 30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay.

84
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
那是“牛至”，戴维 只值十美元的调味品
It was oregano, Dave. It was $10 worth of oregano.

85
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,600
可他认为是大麻
Yeah, well, your client thought it was marijuana.

86
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
我的当事人是个傻瓜，但傻并不违法
My client's a moron. That's not against the law.

87
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,900
凯菲，我同样得给上面一个交代 我必须起诉他
Kaffee, I got people to answer to just like you do. I'm gonna charge him.

88
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,150
告他私藏调味品吗？
With what, possession of a condiment?

89
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,820
凯菲 我很想帮你了结此事…
Kaffee. I tried to help you out of this...

90
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,620
但说到监禁时间，我会申请撤诉
but if you ask for jail time, I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

91
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,530
你办不到 我会办到的
You won't get it. I will get it.

92
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,540
如果法官拒绝，我会申请…
And if the M.T.D. Is denied, I'll file a motion...

93
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,460
要求作一次预先取证
seeking to obtain an evidentiary ruling in advance.

94
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,870
然后反对审前监禁
And after that, I'm gonna file against pretrial confinement.

95
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,500
而你得花上三个月来做书面材料…
And you're gonna spend the next three months going blind on paperwork...

96
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,210
就因为一名二等通信兵购买并吸食调味品
because a signalman second-class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano.

97
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,800
再来，拿下二垒
Let's go! Let's get two!

98
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,300
Ｂ级轻罪，二十天监禁
B misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.

99
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,640
Ｃ级轻罪，十五天受限处罚
C misdemeanor, 15 days restricted duty.

100
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,140
不知道我凭什么要接受
I don't know why I'm agreeing to this.

101
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,480
因为你比一般人要明智
'Cause you have wisdom beyond your years.

102
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,030
早
Morning.

103
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,780
早，上校
Morning, Captain.

104
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,400
孩子怎么样，山姆？
How's the baby, Sam?

105
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,700
她大概随时在准备说出她的第一句话
I think she's getting ready to say her first word any day now.

106
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,330
你怎么知道？
How can you tell?

107
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,080
她看起来象有什么话要说
She just looks like she has something to say.

108
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,750
不好意思，抱歉我来晚了
Excuse me. I'm sorry I'm late.

109
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,790
我知道你没什么好借口…
It's all right, Danny. I know you don't have a good excuse...

110
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,920
所以不会强迫你找个坏借口
so I won't force you to come up with a bad one.

111
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,960
谢谢，长官 第一件事与你有关
Thank you, sir. This first one's for you.

112
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,380
看来你要飞黄腾达了
Seems you're moving up in the world.

113
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,390
是师部要人
Been requested by Division.

114
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,220
要我去哪？
Requested to do what?

115
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,640
古巴，关达那摩湾
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

116
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,810
一名叫道森的海军准下士 非法使用所持武器…
A Marine corporal named Dawson illegally fires a round from his weapon...

117
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,730
向界线另一边的古巴境内开枪
over the fenceline and into Cuban territory.

118
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,690
什么“界线”？ 山姆
What's a fenceline? Sam.

119
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,990
是一堵把好人和坏人分隔开来的高墙
A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys.

120
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,320
好学生 一等兵威廉・圣地亚哥…
Teacher's pet. P.F.C. William Santiago...

121
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,700
威胁要向海军调查部门举报道森
threatens to rat on Dawson to Naval Investigative Service.

122
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,790
道森和他的另一名队友…
Dawson and another member of his squad...

123
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,880
一等兵劳登・多尼 进入圣地亚哥的房间…
P.F.C. Louden Downey, go into Santiago's room...

124
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,340
把他捆了起来，在他喉咙里塞了块抹布…
tie him up, stuff a rag down his throat...

125
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,460
一小时后，圣地亚哥死了
and an hour later, Santiago's dead.

126
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,260
主治医师说那块抹布经过了某种毒药处理
Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin.

127
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,510
他们下的毒？
They poisoned it?

128
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,600
他们矢口否认 都说了些什么？
Not according to them. What did they say?

129
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,270
没说太多，他们明天会乘飞机过来…
Not much. They're being flown up here tomorrow...

130
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,810
周三凌晨六点，你要去古巴呆一天…
and on Wednesday at 0600, you'll catch a transport down to Cuba for the day...

131
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,810
看能找到些什么
to find out what you can.

132
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:09,740
同时，去见见隶属内政部的 乔安妮・盖洛维少校
Meantime, go and see Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway... with Internal Affairs.

133
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,360
有问题吗？
Any questions?

134
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,580
去古巴的飞机…是在早上六点吗，长官？
Uh, the flight to Cuba... Was that 0600 in the morning, sir?

135
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,040
看来重点在于师部要依条例行事
Seems important to Division that this one be handled by the book.

136
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,210
所以要我指派辩护律师，有没有志愿者？
So I'm assigning co-counsel. Any volunteers?

137
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,800
不，我手头的案子太多了
I got a stack of papers on my desk about a mile high.

138
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
去帮帮凯菲吧 去干什么？
Work with Kaffee on this. Doing what?

139
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,090
凯菲只要四天就能摆平
Kaffee will have this done in about four days.

140
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,470
做些管理方面的事
Doing various administrative things.

141
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,430
备份什么的
Backup, whatever.

142
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,100
换句话说，就是我没有任何责任了
In other words, I have no responsibilities here whatsoever.

143
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,640
没错
Right.

144
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,810
正合我意
My kind of case.

145
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,900
对
Right.

146
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,480
好的，但我要周三才能拿到报告
Okay, but I've got to have that report by Wednesday.

147
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,580
嗨 稍等一下，嗨
Hi. Hold on. Hi.

148
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,000
丹尼・凯菲，我是来见
Daniel Kaffee. I was told to me with, uh...

149
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,380
盖洛维少校的
Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

150
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,800
来了解一下情况
About a briefing?

151
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,850
我回头打给你
I'll call you back.

152
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,520
你是师部指定的律师？
You're the attorney Division assigned?

153
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,350
我是首席律师，这是山姆
I'm lead counsel. This is Sam Weinberg.

154
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,610
我对此事不负任何责任
I have no responsibilities here whatsoever.

155
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,820
进来吧，请坐
Come in, please. Have a seat.

156
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,450
中尉，你在海军服役多久了？
Lieutenant, how long have you been in the Navy?

157
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,040
快九个月了
Going on nine months now.

158
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,750
你从律师学校毕业多久了？
And how long have you been out of law school?

159
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,380
一年多一点
A little over a year.

160
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,550
明白了
I see.

161
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,880
我做错什么了吗？
Have I done something wrong?

162
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,640
不，只是我请求师部指派律师时…
It's just that when I petition Division to have counsel assigned...

163
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,720
还指望会被认真对待
I was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

164
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,470
恕我冒昧，实际上确实如此
No offense taken, in case you were wondering.

165
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,850
凯菲中尉被公认是 我们部门最会打官司的人
Commander, Lieutenant Kaffee is generally... considered the best litigator in our office.

166
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,150
九个月内他成功地处理过四十四起案件
He's successfully plea-bargained 44 cases in nine months.

167
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,230
再多一件就能奖一套牛排刀
One more, I get a set of steak knives.

168
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,070
你上过庭吗？
Have you ever been in a courtroom?

169
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,700
驾照被吊销时上过一次
I once had my driver's license suspended.

170
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,740
以我的看法，如果闹上法庭…
Commander, from what I understand, if this thing goes to court...

171
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,950
他们需要的就不是律师而是牧师
they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest.

172
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,540
不，他们需要的是律师
No, they'll need a lawyer.

173
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,660
已经联系过道森的家人
Dawson's family's been contacted.

174
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,290
多尼最亲近的人是他姨妈詹妮・米勒
Downey's closest living relative is Ginny Miller, his aunt.

175
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,250
还没和她联系过，需要我来处理吗？
She hasn't been contacted yet. Would you like me to take care of that?

176
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,800
如果你愿意的话
If you feel like it.

177
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,510
你到那要见的人…
One of the people you'll be seeing down there...

178
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,640
是基地指挥官内森・杰赛普上校
is the barracks C.O., Colonel Nathan Jessup.

179
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,850
我猜你也听说过他
I assume you've heard of him.

180
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,350
谁没听说过呢？
Who hasn't?

181
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,060
他最近上了报，可能被任命为…
He's been in the papers lately. He's expected to be appointed...

182
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,940
国家安全委员会的执行主管
director of operations of National Security Council.

183
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,270
是吗？ 这些信…
Really? These are the letters...

184
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,690
是圣地亚哥在关达那摩写的
that Santiago wrote in his eight months at Gitmo.

185
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,240
就是关达那摩湾 我知道
That's Guantanamo Bay. I knew that one.

186
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,820
他曾写给舰队司令 写给海军指挥部的指挥官…
He wrote to the fleet commander to the commandant of the Marine Corps.

187
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,830
甚至议员，他希望能调离基地
Even his senator. He wanted to be transferred off the base.

188
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,790
但没人理会，你在听吗？
No one was listening. Are you with me? Yeah.

189
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,000
最后，他写给海军调查处…
Finally, he wrote to the Naval Investigative Service...

190
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,130
以提供道森准下士非法开枪的资料…
where he offered information about Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting...

191
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,840
作为调动的交换条件
in exchange for a transfer.

192
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,550
很好，就这些吗？
Right. Is that all?

193
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,510
中尉，这些信似乎提供了…
Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like...

194
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,050
你当事人杀害圣地亚哥的动机
your client had a motive to kill Santiago.

195
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,390
明白了，圣地亚哥是谁？
Got you. And Santiago is who?

196
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,020
被害人
The victim.

197
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,770
写下来，可否假设这些信…
Write that down. Am I correct to assume these letters...

198
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,730
描述的并非关达那摩的光彩之处呢？
don't paint a flattering picture of Marine Corps life at Guantanamo Bay?

199
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,230
对，在 进一步地假设…
Yes, among... Am I further right in assuming...

200
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,150
调查此事有没有可能 令安全委员会的人难堪呢？
investigation of this incident might embarrass the Security Council guy?

201
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,240
杰赛普上校 十二年
Colonel Jessup. Twelve years.

202
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,160
什么？
Sorry?

203
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,490
争取判为共谋及行为不当
I'll get them to drop the conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

204
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,330
刑期十二年
Twelve years.

205
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,040
你没和证人谈过也没看过一页档案
You haven't talked to a witness or looked at a piece of paper.

206
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,170
很意外，对吧？
Pretty impressive, huh?

207
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,920
你应该深入调查
You're gonna have to go deeper than that.

208
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,800
你有什么权限是我应该知道的？
Do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that I should know about?

209
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,680
我的工作就是确保你干好你的工作
My job is to make sure that you do your job.

210
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
我是内政部的特别律师…
I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs...

211
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,180
所以我的权限可说就是看着你
so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face.

212
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,350
看看这些信 希望你从古巴回来能向我汇报
Read the letters. I'll expect your report when you return from Cuba.

213
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,110
当然 你可以走了
Sure. You're dismissed.

214
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,690
我总是忘了这个部分
I always forget that part.

215
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,240
他有点分心
He's a little preoccupied.

216
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,490
下周要和贝赛斯塔医院队比赛
Team's playing Bethesda Medical next week.

217
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,450
告诉他在那可别抖机灵
Tell your friend not to get cute down there.

218
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,870
关达那摩的海军可不好惹
The Marines in Guantanamo are fanatical.

219
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,210
哪方面？
About what?

220
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,630
海军方面
About being Marines.

221
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,710
尊敬的长官…
Dear sir...

222
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,590
我是一等兵威廉・Ｔ・圣地亚哥
my name is P.F.C. William T. Santiago.

223
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:45,260
是隶属海军陆战队Ｗ步兵警卫连二Ｂ排 的一名海军陆战队员
I'm a Marine stationed at Marine barracks... Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Bravo.

224
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,140
我写信是想告知您 我在古巴单位上遇到的麻烦…
I'm writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba...

225
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,810
并请求您的帮助
and to ask for your help.

226
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,270
我之前曾因某种原因在训练时晕倒…
I've fallen out on runs before for several reasons...

227
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,270
感觉象是头晕或恶心
such as feeling dizzy or nauseated.

228
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:02,690
但在五月十八日，从一座小石山下来时 我落后了大约二到三十码
But on May 18, I'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards... going down a rocky unstable hill.

229
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,740
我的中士抓住我并把我向山下推
My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill.

230
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,700
然后我眼前一黑，摔倒在地上
Then I saw all black, and the last thing I remembered was hitting the deck.

231
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,160
到医院后我被告知只是中暑而已
I was brought to the hospital where I was told I just had heat exhaustion.

232
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,790
我请求您帮助我
I ask you to help me.

233
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,380
求您，长官，我想要调离步兵警卫连
Please, sir. I just need to be transferred out of R.S.C.

234
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,920
美国海军陆战队一等兵 威廉・Ｔ・圣地亚哥 谨启
Sincerely, P.F.C. William T. Santiago... U.S. Marine Corps.

235
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,970
另附，作为我调离基地的交换条件…
P.S. In exchange for my transfer off the base...

236
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,010
我可以向您提供有关
I'm willing to provide you with information about...

237
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,430
“八月二日夜间向境外非法开枪事件” 的信息
"The illegal fenceline shooting that occurred the night of August 2."

238
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,690
这个该死的一等兵 威廉・圣地亚哥是什么人？
Who the fuck is P.F.C. William T. Santiago?

239
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,860
是隶属第二Ｂ排的一名一等兵，长官
Private Santiago is a member of Second Platoon Bravo, sir.

240
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,110
是吗，他似乎在“香格里拉” 呆得很不开心啊…
Yeah. Well, apparently he's not very happy down here in Shangri-la...

241
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,240
因为他给圣诞老人之外的所有人写信 请求调离
because he's written letters to everybody but Santa Claus... asking for a transfer.

242
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,290
而且还要披露一桩违纪开枪事件
And now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting.

243
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,870
马修？
Matthew?

244
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,540
我感到震惊，长官
I'm appalled, sir.

245
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,790
你感到震惊
You're appalled.

246
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,380
这小子越级上报还出卖自己的队友…
This kid broke the chain of command and ratted on a member of his unit...

247
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,260
谎称他作为一名海军陆战队员…
to say nothing of the fact that he is a U.S. Marine...

248
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,930
就算没有中暑虚脱，似乎也无法参加训练
and it would appear he can't run from here to there... without collapsing from heat exhaustion.

249
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,270
Ｂ排是他妈的怎么回事，马修？
What the fuck is going on in Bravo Company, Matthew?

250
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,360
上校，我想这事最好还是等私下再谈
Colonel, I think it would be better to hold this discussion in private.

251
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,570
没必要，上校，我可以处理好这事，长官
That won't be necessary, Colonel. I can handle the situation, sir.

252
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:29,360
象你处理柯蒂斯・贝尔那样吗？ 别打断我，上尉
The same way you handled Curtis Bell? Don't interrupt me, Lieutenant!

253
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,990
我还是你的上级 而我是你的上级，马修
I'm still your superior officer. And I'm yours, Matthew.

254
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,210
我想知道我们该如何处理这事
I wanna know what we're going to do about this.

255
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,210
我认为圣地亚哥应该马上调离基地
I think Santiago should be transferred off the base immediately.

256
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,880
他那样差劲吗？
He's that bad, huh?

257
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,090
除此之外，信的内容一传出去…
Not only that. But word of this letter is bound to get out.

258
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,090
他可就有得受了
He's gonna get his ass whipped.

259
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,220
调走圣地亚哥
Hmm. Transfer Santiago.

260
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,810
好吧，我相信你是对的
Yes. I'm sure you're right.

261
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,390
我相信就该这么办
I'm sure that's the thing to do.

262
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,980
等等，我有个更好的主意
Wait. I've got a better idea.

263
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,020
我们把整个班都调离基地
Let's transfer the whole squad off the base.

264
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,190
我们…接下来考虑，Ｗ
Let's... On second thought, Windward...

265
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,490
我们将整个Ｗ连都调离基地
Let's transfer the whole Windward Division off the base.

266
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,200
约翰，到外边去把弟兄们都从边境带走
John, go on out there and get those boys down off the fence.

267
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,750
他们正在收拾行李，汤姆
They're packing their bags. Tom.

268
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,420
长官 给我接总统
Sir. Get me the president on the phone.

269
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,590
我们要放弃古巴的军事基地
We're surrendering our position in Cuba.

270
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,090
是，长官 等等，汤姆
Yes, sir. Wait a minute, Tom.

271
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,090
先不要接总统
Don't get the president just yet.

272
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,800
也许我们该考虑一下
Maybe we should consider this for a second.

273
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,140
出去吧，汤姆 是，长官
Dismissed, Tom. Yes, sir.

274
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,100
也许…我刚才是胡说八道
Maybe... and I'm just spit-balling here...

275
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,230
也许作为长官我们有责任训练圣地亚哥
Maybe we have a responsibility as officers to train Santiago.

276
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,440
也许作为长官我们有责任为国家…
Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country...

277
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,820
看着那些肩负国家安全重任的人…
to see that the men and women charged with its security...

278
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,950
受到专业的训练
are trained professionals.

279
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,950
没错，我确信在什么地方看到过这些话
Yes, I'm certain that I read that somewhere once.

280
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,620
我现在想的是，马金森中校…
And now I'm thinking, Colonel Markinson...

281
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,040
你提议调走圣地亚哥…
that your suggestion of transferring Santiago...

282
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,340
痛快固然是痛快…
while expeditious and certainly painless...

283
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,890
但恐怕不是美国人处理事情的方式
might not be, in a manner of speaking... the American way.

284
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,760
圣地亚哥必须留在这
Santiago stays where he is.

285
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,770
我们要训练这个小伙子
We're gonna train the lad.

286
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,810
约翰，由你负责
John, you're in charge.

287
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:33,780
如果圣地亚哥下次的训练和实习报告 还达不到四-六-四-六的话
Santiago doesn't make 4-6-4-6... on his next proficiency and conduct report...

288
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,160
我唯你是问
I'm going to blame you.

289
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,870
我会毙了你 是，长官
Then I'm going to kill you. Yes, sir.

290
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,540
我认为这是个错误，上校
I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

291
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,080
马修，我想我有些话要和你私下聊聊
Matthew, I think I will have that word in private with you now.

292
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,130
约翰，就这样吧 我们午饭时在军官俱乐部碰头…
John, that's all. Why don't we meet at the "O" club and have lunch...

293
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,800
讨论怎样训练小威廉
and we'll talk about the training of young William?

294
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,590
我很乐意听听您的建议，长官
I'd be delighted to hear any suggestions that you might have, sir.

295
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,590
出去吧 是，长官
Dismissed. Yes, sir.

296
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,640
马修，请坐下
Matthew, sit down. Please.

297
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,400
你觉得肯德瑞克怎么样？
What doyou think of Kendrick?

298
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,280
我对他的看法毫无
My opinion of him has nothing to do...

299
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,530
就我个人而言我觉得他不太靠得住…
I think he's pretty much of a weasel myself...

300
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,570
但他是个很不错的军官
but he's an awfully good officer.

301
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,080
我们最终的目的 就是要训练一支最好的海军陆战队
And in the end, we see eye-to-eye on the best way to run a Marine Corps unit.

302
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,710
保家卫国是我们份内的事，马修
We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew.

303
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,460
这是我们该认真对待的职责
That is a responsibility that we have to take pretty seriously.

304
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,880
我相信对于这样一名 不称职的海军陆战队员…
And I believe that taking a Marine who is not quite up to the job...

305
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,430
把他送到其他单位…
and shipping him off to another assignment...

306
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,470
是拿生命当儿戏
puts lives in danger.

307
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,520
坐下，马修
Sit down, Matthew.

308
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,070
想想过去吧
We go back a while.

309
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,660
我们一同上军校，一同接受任命
We went to the Academy together. We were commissioned together.

310
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,200
一同经历过越战
We did our tours in Vietnam together.

311
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,620
只不过我得到的一系列提升…
But I've been promoted up through the chain...

312
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,620
比起你来要运气好一些
with greater speed and success than you have.

313
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,670
现在，如果是因为这个…
Now, if that's a source of tension...

314
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,670
令你感到难堪…
or embarrassment foryou...

315
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,500
我不会太在意
I don't give a shit.

316
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,800
我们的职责性命攸关，马金森中校
We're in the business of saving lives, Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.

317
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,010
永远别在其他军官面前质疑我的命令
Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer.

318
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,370
所有材料都准备好了
All the paperwork's in order.

319
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,410
过去吧 是，长官
Step over there. Yes, sir.

320
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,880
哈罗德，这就是华盛顿特区？
Hal, is this Washington, D. C?

321
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,550
对，我们走吧
All right. Let's move.

322
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,050
是，长官
Yes, sir.

323
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,890
这一击能拿满分 打扰一下
Got all of that one. Excuse me.

324
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,560
我想和你谈谈道森和多尼的事
I wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.

325
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,230
什么？ 道森和多尼
Say again? Dawson and Downey.

326
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,480
这些名字听起来和我有点关系
Those names sound like they should mean something to me...

327
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,400
道森，多尼…你的当事人
Dawson, Downey... your clients.

328
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,780
古巴的事，对了，道森和多尼，没错
The Cuba thing. Yes! Dawson and Downey. Right.

329
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,040
我又做错了什么吗？
I've done something wrong again, haven't I?

330
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,960
我只是奇怪那两个人一早就被关押的同时 他们的律师却在打球
I was just wondering why two guys have been locked up... since this morning while their lawyer's outside hitting a ball.

331
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,630
我们需要训练
We need the practice.

332
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,250
这并不好笑
That wasn't funny.

333
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,380
有一点点好笑
It was a little funny.

334
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,760
如果我向你的上司建议另外指派律师 会不会令你感到羞辱？
Would you be very insulted if I recommended to your supervisor... that he assign different counsel?

335
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,310
理由呢？ 我认为你不适合办理此案
Why? I don't think you're fit to handle it.

336
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,140
你根本不了解我 一般来说，总得花些时间…
You don't even know me. Ordinarily, it takes someone hours...

337
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,860
来了解我适不适合作辩护律师
to discover I'm not fit to handle a defense.

338
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,990
得了吧，这未免太可笑了
Oh, come on. That was damn funny.

339
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,070
你错了
You're wrong.

340
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,160
我了解你
I do know you.

341
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,080
丹尼・艾勒斯塔・凯菲 一九六四年六月八日生于…
Daniel Alistair Kaffee, born June 8, 1964...

342
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
波士顿仁爱医院
at Boston Mercy Hospital.

343
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,460
你父亲莱昂内尔・凯菲…
Your father's Lionel Kaffee...

344
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,050
曾担任海军军法检察官及美国司法部长
former Navy judge advocate and attorney general of the United States.

345
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,670
一九八五年去世
Died 1985.

346
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,510
你上过哈佛法学院，毕业后加入海军…
You went to Harvard law. Then you joined the Navy...

347
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,340
也许这是出于你父亲的要求
probably because that's what your father wanted you to do.

348
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,760
所以现在你只想在海军军法署混上三年
And now you're just treading water for three years in the JAG Corps.

349
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,310
混到退役找一份真正的工作
Just laying low till you can get out and get a real job.

350
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,940
如果是这样的话也无可厚非 我不会告诉任何人
If that's the situation, that's fine. I won't tell anyone.

351
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,280
但我认为如果象求快，耍小聪明的 波斯商贩那样来对待本案…
But it's my feeling that if this case is handled in the same... fast-food, slick-ass, Persian bazaar manner...

352
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,240
用你应付其他案子的那一套…
with which you seem to handle everything else...

353
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,950
就会漏掉一些东西
then something's gonna get missed.

354
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,740
如果道森和多尼因为他们的律师…
And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey...

355
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,370
预先就盘算不尽全力而使他们…
to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary...

356
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,540
多受哪怕一天的牢狱之灾，就是我的失职
because their attorney had predetermined the path of least resistance.

357
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,340
真令我兴奋，少校
I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

358
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,300
我不相信他们会杀人
I don't think your clients murdered anyone.

359
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,720
理由根据呢？
What are you basing this on?

360
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,590
没有动机
There was no intent.

361
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,510
医检报告说圣地亚哥死于窒息…
The doctor's report says Santiago died of asphyxiation...

362
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,520
是因为急性乳酸中毒…
brought on by acute lactic acidosis...

363
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,440
而这种症状很容易让人联想到是人为的
and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poison.

364
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,270
我不知道这表示什么，但听起来相当不妙
I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad.

365
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,230
圣地亚哥是死于凌晨一点
Santiago died at 1:00 a.m.

366
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,150
三点时医生还无法确定死因
At 3:00, the doctor wasn't able to determine the cause of death.

367
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,450
两小时后，他说是死于中毒
Two hours later, he said it was poison.

368
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,030
哦，我现在懂你的意思了
Oh, now I see what you're saying.

369
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,410
肯定是图书馆的普拉姆教授 用烛台打死了他
It had to be Professor Plum in the library with a candlestick.

370
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,950
我去和你的上司谈好了 行啊
I'm gonna talk to your supervisor. Okay.

371
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,170
直接去宾州林荫大道
Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue.

372
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,750
找一幢有柱子的白色宫殿
It's the big white house with the pillars in front.

373
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,050
谢了 我觉得你的运气不会太好
Thank you. I don't think you'll have much luck.

374
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,510
我是由师部任命的
I was assigned by Division.

375
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,680
那儿有人认为我是个很不错的律师
Somebody over there thinks I'm a pretty good lawyer.

376
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,220
我对你的专注和热情表示敬佩…
So while I appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm...

377
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,770
但我认为我自己能处理好这事
I think I can handle things myself.

378
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,930
知道什么是“红色条规”吗？
You know what a Code Red is?

379
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,940
真遗憾
What a pity.

380
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,620
早，长官 早
Morning, sir. Morning.

381
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,210
长官到，立正
Officer on deck!

382
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,460
长官，哈罗德・道森准下士，长官
Sir, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson, sir!

383
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,710
隶属Ｗ步兵警卫连二Ｂ排
Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Bravo.

384
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,090
曾经违纪并且 不能和队友好好相处的哈罗德？
Someone hasn't been working and playing well with others, Harold.

385
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,050
长官，是的，长官
Sir, yes, sir!

386
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,180
长官，一等兵劳登・多尼，长官
Sir, P.F.C. Louden Downey, sir!

387
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,310
我是丹尼・凯菲，这是山姆・温伯格
I'm Daniel Kaffee. This is Sam Weinberg.

388
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,470
坐吧
Sit down.

389
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,650
这是你的签名？ 是的，长官
This your signature? Yes, sir.

390
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,490
用不着叫我长官，这是你的签名吗？
You don't have to call me "sir." Is this your signature?

391
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,700
长官，是的，长官
Sir, yes, sir.

392
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,700
完全没必要一句话叫两次长官
You certainly don't need to do it twice in one sentence.

393
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,370
什么是“红色条规”？ 是一种训诫条规
What's a Code Red? It is a disciplinary engagement.

394
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,830
表示什么？
What's that mean?

395
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,830
如果有陆战队员掉队 就可以用来帮助这个队员跟上队伍
A Marine falls out of line, it's up to the men in his unit to get him on track.

396
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,380
“红色条规”具体是什么花样？ 长官？
What's a garden variety Code Red? Sir?

397
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,380
哈罗德，你这么叫会让我 忍不住回头看是不是我爸爸来了
Harold, you say, "sir," and I turn around and look for my father.

398
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,010
叫我丹尼，凯菲都行
Danny, Daniel, Kaffee.

399
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,180
说明白点 “红色条规”大概是什么意思？
Garden variety. Typical. What's basic Code Red?

400
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,890
长官，比如有队员拒绝按规定洗澡…
Sir, a Marine refuses to bathe on a regular basis...

401
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,560
队友就会给他洗个“军用澡”
the men in his squad will give him a G.I. Shower.

402
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,810
怎么个洗法？
What's that?

403
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,480
用刷子，钢丝刷
Scrub brushes, Brillo pads, steel wool.

404
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,810
太妙了
Beautiful.

405
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,480
圣地亚哥接受的也是“红色条规”吗？
Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red?

406
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,190
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

407
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,660
他从不说话吗？
Does he ever talk?

408
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,040
长官，一等兵多尼会回答你的所有问题
Sir, P.F.C. Downey will answer any direct questions you ask him.

409
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,620
非？
Swell.

410
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,050
多尼，你塞进圣地亚哥嘴里的抹布
Private Downey, the rag you stuffed in Santiago's mouth...

411
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,010
有没有毒？ 没有，长官
Was there poison on it? No, sir.

412
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,590
上光剂，松节油，防冻剂之类？
Silver polish, turpentine, antifreeze?

413
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,050
没有，长官，我们只是想给他剃头
No, sir. We were just gonna shave his head, sir.

414
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,930
突然之间
When all of the sudden...

415
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,430
我们看到他的嘴在流血…
We saw blood dripping down his mouth...

416
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,690
我们撕掉胶布，他满脸都是血，长官
and we pulled the tape off and there was blood all down his face, sir.

417
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,020
接着道森准下士就打电话叫了救护车
That's when Lance Corporal Dawson called the ambulance.

418
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,770
有人看到你打电话吗？
Did anyone see you call the ambulance?

419
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,900
没有，长官
No, sir.

420
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,160
救护车来时你在那吗？
Were you there when the ambulance got there?

421
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,620
是的，长官，这时我们已经被拘捕
Yes, sir. That's when we were taken under arrest.

422
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,620
八月二日夜间 你是否在边界向古巴境内开过枪？
The night of August 2, did you fire a shot across the fenceline into Cuba?

423
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,830
是的，长官 为什么？
Yes, sir. Why?

424
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,750
我的对象在动手，长官 对象？
My mirror engaged, sir. His mirror?

425
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,670
每个美军岗哨都有一个对应的古巴岗哨 称为“对象”
Every American sentry post has a Cuban counterpart, called "mirrors."

426
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:41,220
下士的意思是他的对象想向他开枪
Lance Corporal's claiming that his mirror was about to fire at him.

427
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,760
圣地亚哥写信给海军调查处…
Santiago's letter to the N.I. S...

428
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,310
说你违纪开枪
said you fired illegally.

429
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,310
他说那个人，那个对象
He's saying that the guy, the mirror...

430
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,940
决没有任何行动
He never made a move.

431
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,320
你明白我在说什么吗？
You see what I'm getting at?

432
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,660
既然圣地亚哥和你没有私怨 为何对他执行“红色条规”？
If Santiago didn't have anything on you, then why did you give him a Code Red?

433
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,910
因为他越级上报，长官
'Cause he broke the chain of command, sir.

434
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,960
什么？ 他撇开了自己的单位，长官
He what? He went outside of his unit, sir.

435
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,420
如果他有问题，应该先向我报告，长官
If he had a problem, he should have spoken to me, sir.

436
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,550
然后才是中士，指挥官 好了好了
Then his sergeant, then commander... Yeah. All right.

437
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,260
你袭击他时是否意图杀死他？
Did you assault Santiago with the intent of killing him?

438
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,970
没有，长官 意图何在？
No, sir. What was your intent?

439
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,840
教训他，长官 教训他什么？
To train him, sir. Train him to do what?

440
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,430
考虑个人之前先考虑集体…要尊重秩序
Train him to think of his unit before himself... to respect the code.

441
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,270
什么秩序？
What's the code?

442
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,350
分队，军团，上帝，国家
Unit, Corps, God, Country.

443
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,650
能再说一次吗？
I beg your pardon?

444
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,230
依次为分队、军团、上帝、国家，长官
Unit, Corps, God, Country, sir.

445
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,920
美国政府…
The government of the United States...

446
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,800
要指控你俩谋杀…
wants to charge you two with murder...

447
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,510
你想让我对起诉人说什么 分队，军团，上帝，国家吗？
and you want me to go to the prosecutor... with "Unit, Corps, God, Country"?

448
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,560
这是我们的规矩，长官
That's our code, sir.

449
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,350
你们的规矩
It's your code.

450
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,020
我们还会来
We'll be back.

451
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,980
有什么需要吗？ 书，纸张，香烟，火腿三明治？
You guys need anything... books, papers, cigarettes, ham sandwich?

452
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,320
长官，不用，谢谢，长官
Sir, no, thank you, sir.

453
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,200
哈罗德，我觉得你最好开始明白一件事
Harold, I think there's a concept you better start warming up to.

454
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,490
长官？
Sir?

455
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,200
我是你们唯一的朋友
I'm the only friend you've got.

456
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,510
丹尼・凯菲
Daniel Kaffee

457
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,590
微笑的杰克・罗斯
Smiling Jack Ross.

458
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,930
欢迎你的加入 是吗？
Welcome to the big time. You think so?

459
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,890
为道森和多尼着想 但愿你的专业水平高于垒球水平
Let's hope, for Dawson and Downey, you practice law better than play softball.

460
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,480
真为他俩遗憾 我没有什么能比垒球更擅长
Unfortunately for those two, I don't do anything better than play softball.

461
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,020
我走了，简奈儿 再见
I'm out of here, Janelle. Bye.

462
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,440
等我从古巴回来再见 代我向卡斯特罗问好
See you when I get back from Cuba. Say hi to Castro for me.

463
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,820
没问题，有何见教？
Will do. What are we looking at?

464
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,070
他们认罪 就网开一面只告他们共谋及行为不当
They plead guilty, we drop the conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

465
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,410
二十年，十年后就能回家 我想要十二年
Twentyyears. They're home in half. I want 12.

466
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,410
办不到 他们叫了救护车
Can't do it. They called the ambulance.

467
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,830
我不在乎他们叫过谁，总之他们杀了人
I don't care if they called the Avon lady. They killed a Marine.

468
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,000
那块抹布化验过了 法医和化验报告都说未必如此
The rag was tested for poison. The autopsy, lab reports. They say the same thing: Maybe, maybe not.

469
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,170
关达那摩湾海军医院的内科主任…
Chief of Internal Medicine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Hospital...

470
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,710
说他可以肯定
says he's sure.

471
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,880
你知道“红色条规”吗？
What do you know about Code Reds?

472
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,380
哦，老天
Oh, man.

473
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,430
这算私人谈话吧？ 说说看
We off the record? Tell me.

474
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,600
就依你的，判十二年
I'm gonna give you the 12 years.

475
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,850
不过你在明天给自己惹麻烦之前该知道…
Before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know...

476
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,060
排长乔纳森・肯德瑞克上尉…
the platoon commander, Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

477
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,070
召集手下开过会并且特地…
held a meeting with the men and specifically...

478
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,570
告诉他们别碰圣地亚哥
told them not to touch Santiago.

479
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,030
我们明晚还打篮球吗？ 算是成交了？
We still playing hoops tomorrow night? Do we have a deal?

480
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,790
等我回来再说
I'll talk toyou when I get back.

481
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,040
你好 找到谁替换我了吗？
Hi there. Any luck getting me replaced?

482
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,340
是不是部里所有人都是你的酒友或球友？
Is there anyone in this command you don't either drink or play ball with?

483
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,300
少校 听着，我是来讲和的
Commander... Listen. I came to make peace.

484
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,430
我承认之前对你有误会 怎么样？可以做朋友吗？
Got off on the wrong foot. What do you say? Friends?

485
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,550
我照多尼的要求给他带了些漫画
I brought Downey some comic books he was asking for.

486
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,060
这孩子根本不明白自己的处境
The kid, Kaffee, I swear he doesn't know where he is.

487
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,480
甚至不知为何被捕 少校
Doesn't even know why he's arrested. Commander.

488
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,270
可以叫我乔安妮 乔安妮
You can call me Joanne. Joanne.

489
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,600
乔也可以 好的
Or Jo. Yes.

490
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,690
乔，如果你再私自和我的当事人交谈…
Jo, if you ever speak to a client of mine again without my permission...

491
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,280
我就把你排除在外
I'll have you disbarred.

492
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,610
行吗，朋友？ 有人授权给我
Friends? I had authorization.

493
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,450
谁？ 多尼最亲的亲人
From where? Downey's closest living relative.

494
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,080
詹妮・米勒，他的姨妈
Ginny Miller. His aunt on his mother's side.

495
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,500
詹妮・米勒授权给了你？
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?

496
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,540
我照你的要求给她打了电话
I gave her a call like you asked.

497
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,040
很不错的女人，我们聊了将近一小时
Very nice woman. We spoke for about an hour.

498
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,630
詹妮・米勒授权给了你
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.

499
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,380
我完全有这个权利
Perfectly within my province.

500
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,880
她有车库吗？我们可以在那庭审
Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We could hold the trial there.

501
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,100
我懂缝纫，没准能给他叔叔缝件法官制服
I can sew the costumes. Maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge.

502
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,060
我明天和你一起去古巴
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

503
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,860
看来好戏还在后头
And the hits just keep on coming.

504
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,470
过得怎么样，卢瑟？ 多活一天算一天，中尉
How's it going, Luther? Another day, another dollar, captain.

505
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,720
看来你是听天由命了 爱怎么着怎么着吧
You gotta play them as they lay. What goes around comes around.

506
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,220
惹不起就投降好了 至少我的身体还行
Can't beatthem, joingem. At least I got my health.

507
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,060
这比什么都实在，明天见，卢瑟
Well, then you got everything. See you tomorrow, Luther.

508
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,060
我可会躲着你
Not if I seeyou first.

509
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,400
别忘了莎莉回来时给我作证
Now don't forget. When Sally gets back, you're my witness.

510
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,780
孩子说话了，我女儿说话了
The baby spoke. My daughter said a word.

511
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,150
我可不能肯定她那是在说话
Your daughter made a sound, Sam. I'm not sure it was a word.

512
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,110
得了吧，那肯定是在说话
Come on, now. It was definitely a word.

513
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,740
你明明听到她在指着我说“爸爸”
You heard her. The girl sat here, pointed and said, "Pa."

514
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,870
没错，她就是说“爸爸”
She did. She said, "Pa."

515
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,170
可她指的是邮筒，山姆
She was pointing at a mailbox, Sam.

516
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,290
没错，等于是说：“爸爸，看，邮筒”
That's right, pointing as if to say, "Pa, look. A mailbox."

517
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,930
杰克・罗斯今天找过我 他同意只判十二年
Jack Ross came to see me today. He offered me the 12 years.

518
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,680
正是你想要的不是吗？ 我知道
Oh, that's what you wanted, right? I know, I know.

519
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,400
我是说，我觉得应该接受，应该接受
I mean, I guess I'll take it. I'll take it.

520
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,530
那么，只用了四十五秒就说定了
So... It took about 45 seconds.

521
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,280
没费多大力气
He barely put up a fight.

522
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,950
丹尼，接受吧，这是份大礼
Danny, take the 12 years. It's a gift.

523
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,910
你不相信他们的供词对吧？
You don't believe their story, do you?

524
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,160
你觉得他们该在牢里过下半辈子
You think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives.

525
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,410
我相信他们说的每句话…
I believe every word of their story...

526
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,580
也认为他们该在牢里过下半辈子
and I think they ought to go to jail for the rest oftheir lives.

527
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,880
明天见 好的
See you tomorrow. Okay.

528
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,630
别忘了穿白色制服，那边很热
Don't forget to wear the whites. Very hot down there.

529
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,550
我不喜欢白色制服
I don't like the whites.

530
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,970
没人喜欢，但我们要去古巴
Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba.

531
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,770
有没有茶苯海明？ 是用来降温的吗？
You got Dramamine? Dramamine keeps you cool?

532
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,400
不，是用来防止呕吐的 坐飞机会让你感到不舒服
No, Dramamine keeps you from throwing up. You get sick when you fly.

533
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,860
我不舒服是因为担心飞机撞到山上
I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain.

534
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,440
恐怕茶苯海明没什么用
I don't think Dramaminewill help.

535
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,900
我有些牛至，听说很管用
I got some oregano. I hear that works pretty good.

536
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,580
罗斯提到的一件怪事让我改变了想法
You know, Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left.

537
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,080
他说排长乔纳森・肯德瑞克上尉…
He said the platoon commander Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

538
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,750
召集手下开会告诉他们别碰圣地亚哥
had a meeting with the men and told them not to touch Santiago.

539
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,170
那么？
So?

540
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,960
我从没提过这人，根本不知道他是谁
I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't even know who he is.

541
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,680
管他怎么回事，明天见
Ah, what the hell. I'll see you tomorrow.

542
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,930
两位中尉，盖洛维少校
Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg, Commander Galloway.

543
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,680
我是巴恩斯下士，是来送你们去基地的
I'm Corporal Barnes. I'm to escort you to the windward side of the base.

544
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,930
谢谢 我这有几件迷彩服
Thank you. I got some camouflage jackets here.

545
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,100
我建议你们都穿上 迷彩服？
I suggest you both put them on. Camouflage jackets?

546
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,310
是的，长官，我们一路上离边境相当近
Yes, sir. We'll be riding pretty close to the fenceline.

547
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,520
古巴人看到穿白制服的军官…
The Cubans see an officer wearing white...

548
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,190
有可能认为是重要人物而开枪
they think it might be someone they want to take a shot at.

549
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,490
你出的好主意，山姆
Good call, Sam.

550
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,660
很快就到渡口，要不了多久
We'll just hop on the ferry. We'll be there in no time.

551
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,330
等等，还得坐船吗？ 是的，长官
Wait. We gotta take a boat? Yes, sir.

552
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:57,040
要到海湾的另一侧 没人提过要坐船
To get to the other side of the bay. Nobody said anything about a boat.

553
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,920
有问题吗，长官？ 不，没问题
Is there a problem, sir? No, no problem.

554
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,720
只是讨厌坐船而已
Just not crazy about boats.

555
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,100
老天，凯菲 你可是海军，却因为坐船而感到害怕
Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy, for crying out loud.

556
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,770
没人会对坐船太感兴趣 是的，长官
Nobody likes her very much. Yes, sir!

557
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,530
我是内森・杰赛普，请进
Nathan Jessup. Come on in.

558
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,620
谢谢，长官，我是丹尼・凯菲 道森和多尼的律师
Thank you, sir. Daniel Kaffee. I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey.

559
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,040
这是乔安妮・盖洛维少校
This is Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway.

560
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,330
幸会，少校 她负责监督评估，长官
Pleasure meeting you, Commander. Observing and evaluating, sir.

561
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,290
山姆・温伯格中尉，我的助手
Lieutenant Sam Weinberg. He'll be assisting.

562
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,130
长官 这是我的助手，马金森中校…
Sir. This is my X.O., Colonel Markinson...

563
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,210
和排长肯德瑞克上尉
and platoon leader Lieutenant Kendrick.

564
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,800
是我让他们来的，请坐
I've asked them to join us. Sit down, please.

565
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,340
凯菲中尉 马金森中校
Lieutenant Kaffee. Colonel Markinson.

566
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,930
我曾有幸见过你父亲一面
I had the pleasure of meeting your father once.

567
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,020
我当时才十多岁，他到学校去演讲
I was a teenager. He spoke at my high school.

568
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,180
莱昂纳尔・凯菲？
Lionel Kaffee?

569
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
是的，长官 你们知道吗？
Yes, sir. Well, what do you know?

570
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,730
约翰，他父亲曾在你老家得罪过很多人
John, this man's dad once made a lot of enemies down in your neck of the woods.

571
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,570
杰斐逊和麦迪逊地区学校打官司
Jefferson v. Madison County School District.

572
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,950
当地人反对一个黑人女孩到白人学校上学
Folks down there said a black girl couldn't go to an all-white school.

573
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,950
莱昂纳尔・凯菲说 “我们就等着瞧好了”
Lionel Kaffee said, "Well, we'll just see about that."

574
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,620
你父亲怎么样，丹尼？
How the hell is your dad, Danny?

575
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,080
他七年前去世了，长官
He passed away seven years ago, sir.

576
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,670
千万别以为我是故意这么问
Don't I feel like the fucking asshole.

577
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,050
绝对不会
Not at all.

578
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,390
有什么需要我们效劳的，丹尼？
Well, what can we do for you, Danny?

579
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,390
没什么，长官
Uh, not much, sir.

580
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,890
说起来纯粹只是例行公事而已
This is really a formality more than anything else.

581
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,810
军法署署长要求我们面见所有相关证人
JAG Corps insists that we interview all the relevant witnesses.

582
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,820
署长有权这样要求
The JAG Corps can be demanding that way.

583
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,360
约翰会带你们去见想见的人
John will take you out and show you what you want to see.

584
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,490
之后我们可以一起吃午饭
After that we can all hook up for lunch.

585
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,820
怎么样？ 好的，长官
How does that sound? Good. Fine, sir.

586
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,380
那天下午你召集部下开过会是吗？
I understand you had a meeting with your men that afternoon.

587
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,750
是的，没错 都说了些什么？
Yes, I did. What did you guys talk about?

588
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,220
我告诉他们我们中间有个告密者…
I told the men that we had an informer among us...

589
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,260
不管大家有多想惩罚他…
and that despite any desire they might have to seek retribution...

590
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,850
总之不得伤害一等兵圣地亚哥
Private Santiago was not to be harmed in anyway.

591
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,230
什么时候开的会？
16:00 What time was that meeting? 16:00.

592
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,140
就是四点
That's 4:00.

593
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,030
山姆，应该找人把这些送交他的父母
Sam, we should make sure somebody gets this to his parents.

594
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,280
我们不再需要这些了 是啊
We don't need it anymore. Right.

595
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,790
肯德瑞克上尉，能叫你约翰吗？
Lieutenant Kendrick, may I call you John?

596
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,920
不，不行
No, you may not.

597
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,130
我是不是冒犯了你？
Have I done something to offend you?

598
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,290
不，我喜欢你们海军
No, I like all you Navy boys.

599
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,510
每次我们去什么地方打仗 你们总会送我们一程
Every time we gotta go someplace to fight, you fellas always give us a ride.

600
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,260
肯德瑞克上尉 你认为圣地亚哥是死于谋杀吗？
Lieutenant Kendrick, do you think Santiago was murdered?

601
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,220
少校，我信奉主和他的儿子耶稣
Commander, I believe in God and His Son Jesus Christ.

602
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,270
所以我只能说
And because I do, I can say this:

603
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,060
一等兵圣地亚哥死了，这是个悲剧
Private Santiago is dead, and that is a tragedy.

604
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,400
但他的死是因为不守规矩
But he is dead because he had no code.

605
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,860
他的死是因为他对主不敬 而上帝觉察到了
He is dead because he had no honor, and God was watching.

606
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,990
你同意这种观点吗？
How do you feel about that theory?

607
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,330
有道理，我们走吧
Sounds good. Let's move on.

608
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,370
你的计划是来此调查…
Are you planning on doing any investigating...

609
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,370
还是仅仅来旅游？
or are you just gonna take the guided tour?

610
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,830
我有我的处理方式
I'm pacing myself.

611
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,380
他们来来回回跑了三个钟头…
They were running around for three hours...

612
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,420
想找些白色的东西用来当白旗
Iooking for anything white they could wave in the air.

613
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,800
有些人向一个有线新闻网的人投了降
Some of these people surrendered to a crew from CNN.

614
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,220
我总是说，无遮无掩 却战胜了一支装甲部队
Well, walk softly and carry an armored tank division, I always say.

615
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,810
味道很好，谢谢 是我的荣幸，长官
That was delicious. Thank you. My pleasure, sir.

616
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:31,730
上校，我想问您几个关于九月六日的问题
Colonel, I do have to ask you a couple of questions about September 6.

617
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,360
尽管问
Shoot.

618
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,070
早上六点，您曾接触过 一个海军调查处的官员…
On the morning of the sixth, you were contacted by an N.I.S. Agent...

619
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,570
他说圣地亚哥曾向他透露 一起边界违规开枪事件
who said that Santiago tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting.

620
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,830
是的 圣地亚哥是以此…
Yes. Santiago would reveal the person...

621
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,700
作为调动的交换条件 是的
in exchange for a transfer. Yes.

622
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,630
如果您觉得我漏掉了什么细节…
If you feel there are any details that I'm missing...

623
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,960
您可以直接了当地说出来
you should feel free to speak up.

624
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,880
谢谢
Thank you.

625
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:06,680
然后您将马金森中校 和肯德瑞克上尉叫到了您的办公室
Now, at this point you called Lieutenant Colonel Markinson... and Lieutenant Kendrick into your office.

626
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,440
是这样吗？ 是的
Is that right? Yes.

627
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,650
结果呢？
What happened?

628
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:15,570
我们都同意 为了圣地亚哥的安全应该将他调离基地
We agreed that, for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred off base.

629
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,700
圣地亚哥已被安排调离基地？
Santiago was set to be transferred.

630
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,540
搭乘第二天凌晨六点 第一趟飞往美国的航班
On the first available flight to the States... 0600 the next morning.

631
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,790
从结果来看，五个小时太长了
Five hours too late, as it turned out.

632
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,380
好了，就到这吧，非常感谢各位
All right. That's all I have. Thanks very much for your time.

633
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,760
下士在车上等着，他会送你们回机场
Corporal's waiting with the Jeep. He'll take you back to the flight line.

634
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,800
谢谢，长官 等等，我还有些问题
Thank you, sir. Wait. I've got some questions.

635
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,510
不，别问了 不，我要问
No, you don't. Yes, I do.

636
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,600
不，别问了 圣地亚哥死的那天早上…
No, you don't. On the morning that Santiago died...

637
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,270
三点到五点之间您有没有见过斯通医生？
did you meet with Dr. Stone between 3:00 and 5:00?

638
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:53,400
我的一名步下死了，我当然要见医生
Of course I met with the doctor. One of my men was dead.

639
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,980
懂了吧？人都死了，走吧
See? The man was dead. Let's go.

640
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,780
我想知道您是否听说过“红色条规”
I'm just wondering if you've ever heard the term "Code Red."

641
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,740
我听说过，是的
I've heard the term, yes.

642
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,830
今年二月，您收到过一份警诫备忘录…
This past February, you received a cautionary memo...

643
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,200
是由大西洋舰队总司令签发的…
from the commander-in-chief of the Atlantic fleet...

644
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,460
警告军官 不得纵容现役军人私自实施处罚
warning that the practice of enlisted men... disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers.

645
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,050
我得提醒你写备忘录的人…
Well, I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo...

646
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,050
绝对不用面对…
has never faced the working end...

647
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,180
古巴人手上的苏制ＡＫ４７自动步枪
of a Soviet-made Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.

648
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,970
不过，对于总司令的指示…
However, the directive having come from the commander...

649
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,140
我给予了应有的关注
I gave it its due attention.

650
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,810
你的重点是什么，乔？ 她没有重点
What is your point, Jo? She has no point.

651
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,770
没有重点是她迷人之处
She often has no point. It's part of her charm.

652
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:37,860
我们走了，谢谢 我认为这里仍然存在“红色条规”
We're out of here. Thank you. I think Code Reds still go on here.

653
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,200
是不是这样？ 乔，他用不着回答这些
Do Code Reds still happen here? Jo, he doesn't need to answer that.

654
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,820
不，他必须回答 不，他真的不用
Yes, he does. No, he really doesn't.

655
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,950
他必须回答
Yeah, he really does.

656
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,960
真是抓住了我的要害
You know, it just hit me.

657
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
她军衔比你高吧，丹尼？
She outranks you, Danny.

658
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,880
是的，长官 我要告诉你一件事
Yes, sir. I wanna tell you something.

659
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,470
听好了，因为我很在意这事
And listen up,'cause I really mean this.

660
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,260
你是世上最幸运的男人
You're the luckiest man in the world.

661
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,640
相信我，各位…世上没有什么事情
There is nothing on this earth sexier... believe me, gentlemen...

662
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,730
比你一大早就得给一个女人敬礼更性感
than a woman that you have to salute in the morning.

663
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,690
把她们全都提升，因为事实上
Promote them all, I say,'cause this is true:

664
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,900
如果没有上级军官为你口交…
If you haven't gotten a blow job from a superior officer...

665
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,530
那你就错过了生活中最美妙的东西
well, you're just letting the best in life pass you by.

666
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,280
上校，“红色条规”仍被军官
Colonel, the practice of Code Reds is still condoned by officers...

667
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,790
我的问题在于我是个上校 所以我得去洗个冷水澡…
My problem is that I'm a colonel, so I'll go on taking cold showers...

668
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,410
直到选出一位女总统
until they elect some gal president.

669
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,960
我要你回答我的问题，长官
I need an answer to my question, sir.

670
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,590
注意你的语气，少校
Take caution in your tone, Commander.

671
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,130
我是个平和的人 但这该死的高温让我完全失去了理智
I'm a fair guy, but this fucking heat is making me absolutely crazy.

672
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,220
你问“红色条规”？在档案上…
You wanna ask me about Code Reds? On the record...

673
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,270
我是禁止实施的…
I tell you I discourage the practice...

674
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,390
和总司令的指示一致
in accordance with the commander's directive.

675
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,520
但撇开档案，告诉你 是军团内部训练很重要的一部分
Off the record, I tell you it is an invaluable part... of close-infantry training.

676
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,530
只要事情不是发生在我眼皮底下 就顺其自然
And if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it.

677
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,650
我以我的方式来管理我的部下
I run my unit how I run my unit.

678
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,160
你想调查我 尽管看看你有多大的机会好了
You wanna investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances.

679
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,710
我吃早餐时三百码外 有四千名训练有素的古巴人想干掉我
I eat breakfast 300 yards from 4,000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

680
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,880
所以别以为你可以跑到这来…
So don't think for one second that you can come down here...

681
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,040
耀武扬威…
flash a badge...

682
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,710
吓唬我
and make me nervous.

683
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,090
我们走吧
Let's go.

684
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:35,770
上校，我需要一份圣地亚哥调令的复印件
Colonel, I'll just need a copy of Santiago's transfer order.

685
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,350
什么？
What's that?

686
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,610
圣地亚哥的调令，你们应该有这一类档案
Santiago's transfer order. You guys have paperwork on that kind of thing.

687
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,610
我需要一份存档
I just need it for the file.

688
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,690
存档 是的
For the file. Yeah.

689
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:52,160
你当然可以复印一份调令用来存档
Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order for the file.

690
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,490
我会尽力协助你们 谢谢
I'm here to help in anyway I can. Thank you.

691
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,670
你相不相信我会尽我所能协助你？
You believe that, don't you, Danny, that I'm here to help you in anyway I can?

692
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,880
当然
Of course.

693
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:06,130
去机场时下士会送你们去人事部门…
Corporal will take you by personnel on your way out to the flight line...

694
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,510
你可以复印你想要的所有调令
and you can have all the transfer orders that you want.

695
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,760
走吧 但你们得对我客气点
Let's go. But you have to ask me nicely.

696
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,310
什么？
I beg your pardon?

697
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:21,560
你得对我客气点
You have to ask me nicely.

698
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,020
知道吗，丹尼，枪林弹雨流血我都能应付
You see, Danny, I can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood.

699
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,280
我不需要金钱，不需要奖章
I don't want money, and I don't want medals.

700
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,030
我要的是穿着娘娘腔的白色制服 的你站在那…
What I do want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform...

701
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,620
用你那哈佛练出来的嘴 给我一点该死的尊重
and with your Harvard mouth extend me some fucking courtesy.

702
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,750
你得对我客气点
You gotta ask me nicely.

703
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,590
杰赛普上校，如果不太麻烦的话…
Colonel Jessup, if it's not too much trouble...

704
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:52,630
我想要一份调令的复印件，长官
I'd like a copy of the transfer order, sir.

705
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,310
没问题
No problem.

706
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,680
第七局，“圣地亚哥”领先 “勇士”试图扳平
In the seventh. San Diego leads. Braves try to come back.

707
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,010
跑垒员别急
Runners don't go.

708
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,850
有力的一击，右外野手，好戏上演了
Hard drive, right field. We're gonna have a tied ball game.

709
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,890
成功了，现在的比分是十比十
It's on its way, and it is now 10 to 10.

710
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,900
真是难以置信
And I don't believe it.

711
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,280
谁？ 是我
Who is it? It's me.

712
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,240
我真想你 我在这自言自语都快三个钟头了
I really missed you. I was just saying to myself it's been almost three hours.

713
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,160
马金森失踪了 什么？
Markinson's disappeared. What?

714
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,000
马金森中校擅离职守
Colonel Markinson's gone U. A... unauthorized absence.

715
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,540
知道了，什么时候？
I know what it means. When?

716
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,880
今天下午，我们离开之后
This afternoon. Sometime after we left.

717
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,250
我明早去找他 我找过了
I'll try to find him in the morning. I've already tried.

718
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,050
找过了？
You tried?

719
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,760
乔安，你几乎够得上教科书上定义的…
Joanne, you're coming dangerously close to the textbook definition...

720
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,100
妨碍政府调查的罪名了
of interfering with a government investigation.

721
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,720
我是劳登・多尼的律师
I'm Louden Downey's attorney.

722
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,600
詹妮姨妈说她似乎已和我相交多年
Aunt Ginny. She says she feels like she's known me for years.

723
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,190
所以我建议由我直接介入本案 可以显得更亲近
So I suggested that she might feel more comfortable... if I were directly involved with the case.

724
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,650
一小时前她得到了劳登的签名同意
She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago.

725
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,700
我想你对此期望过高了…
I suppose it's way too much to hope...

726
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,240
你讨好她就会妨碍我
that you're making this up just to bother me.

727
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,450
别担心，我并不想自作主张
Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a motion for separation.

728
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,410
你还是首席辩护 好极了
You're still lead counsel. Splendid.

729
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,330
我猜你也同意 是肯德瑞克授意的“红色条规”
I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red, and so do you.

730
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,090
我们走吧
Let's go.

731
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,720
长官到，立正
Officer on deck!

732
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,720
是肯德瑞克的命令吗？ 长官？
Did Kendrick order the Code Red? Sir?

733
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,510
别好象我在问你是否打扫过厕所似的
Don't say "Sir" like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine.

734
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,810
是不是上尉命令你们…
You heard what I said. Did Lieutenant Kendrick order you guys...

735
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,890
对圣地亚哥实施“红色条规”？
to give Santiago a Code Red?

736
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,270
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

737
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,110
是他吗？ 是的，长官
Did he? Yes, sir.

738
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,160
介不介意说说为什么以前不告诉我？
You mind telling me why you never mentioned this before?

739
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,290
你没问过 这可不会让我对你有什么好印象
You didn't ask. That won't win you a place in my heart.

740
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,660
你在牢里蹲多久我照样拿薪水
I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail.

741
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,750
是的，长官，我知道，长官
Yes, sir. I know you do, sir.

742
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,000
去你的，哈罗德 好了
Fuck you, Harold! All right.

743
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,550
冷静点
At ease.

744
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,510
我们来说说清楚 活见鬼
Let's sort this thing out. Shit!

745
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:32,050
九月六日下午四点排里开过一个会
There was a platoon meeting on September 6 at 4:00 in the afternoon.

746
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,470
肯德瑞克上尉说他严令…
Lieutenant Kendrick says that he gave strict instructions...

747
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:36,640
不许碰圣地亚哥
that nothing was to happen to Santiago.

748
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,810
是真的吗？
Now, is this true?

749
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,440
你们要实话实话
I want you to speak freely.

750
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,900
夫人，是真的…
Ma'am, that's correct...

751
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,690
但之后我们就解散各自回房了
but then he dismissed the platoon and we all went to our rooms.

752
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,070
后来怎么样？
And what happened then?

753
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,820
肯德瑞克上尉去了我们的房间
Lieutenant Kendrick came to our room, ma'am.

754
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,910
几点？
When?

755
00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:00,660
大约散会五分钟之后 长官，四点二十左右
About five minutes after the meeting broke, sir. About 1620.

756
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,330
然后呢？
And what happened then?

757
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,790
肯德瑞克上尉命令我们 对圣地亚哥执行“红色条规”
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red.

758
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,130
杰克
Jack!

759
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,470
等等
Hang on.

760
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,050
他们是奉命行事
They were given an order.

761
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,140
杰克，过来 马上回来
Jack, come on. Be right back.

762
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,430
你干什么，杰克？ 就回来
What are you doing, Jack? Be right back.

763
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,650
你知道这命令多久了？ 我不知道，这位是？
How long did you know about the order? I didn't. Who's this?

764
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,400
乔・盖洛维，多尼的律师 她很高兴认识你
That's Jo Galloway, Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you.

765
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,650
你想指责我什么？ 你知道这个命令多久了？
What exactly are you accusing me of? How long did you know about the order?

766
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,570
他不知道，如果知道却对我们隐瞒 就违反了职业守则第十四条
He didn't,'cause if he did and hadn't told us... he'd be violating about 14 articles of the Code of Ethics.

767
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,030
他就得担心…
He has enough to worry about...

768
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,240
当事人申请无罪…
God forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty...

769
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,540
并为他们是奉命行事作证
and testify for the record that they were given an order.

770
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,250
肯德瑞克曾明令部下不许碰圣地亚哥
Kendrick specifically told those men not to touch Santiago.

771
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,170
没错，然后他找了道森和多尼…
That's right. And then he went into Dawson and Downey's room...

772
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,250
明令他们执行“红色条规”
and specifically told them to give him a Code Red.

773
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,050
可他说…他在说谎 有证据吗？ 有被告作证
Kendrick said different. Have proof? He's lying. I have the defendants.

774
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,260
可我有二十三名 未被指控谋杀的陆战队员…
And I have 23 Marines who aren't accused of murder...

775
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,640
和一名受过四次嘉奖的上尉
and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation.

776
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,890
马金森为何擅离职守？ 无从查究
Why did Markinson go U. A? We'll never know.

777
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,970
你以为我不能传讯他吗？ 你能找到他再说
You don't think I could subpoena him? You can try, but you won't find him.

778
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,900
知道他二十六年军旅生涯的前十七年 是干什么吗？
You know what he did for the first 17 of his 26 years in the Corps?

779
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,520
反谍报工作，他消失了 再没有什么马金森了
Counterintelligence. Markinson's gone. There is no Markinson.

780
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,860
你看，丹尼
Look, Danny.

781
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,490
杰赛普很快就会提升
Jessup's star is on the rise.

782
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,490
师部会给我很大的余地…
Division will give me a lot of room on this one...

783
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,740
使他和部队免于难堪
to spare Jessup and the Corps any embarrassment.

784
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,950
多大的余地？
How much?

785
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,750
过失杀人，两年刑期 他们六个月后就能回家
Involuntary manslaughter, two years, they're home in six months.

786
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,250
没得商量，我们要上庭
No deal. We're going to court.

787
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,130
你们不会 为什么？
No, you're not. Why not?

788
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,550
因为你会输，丹尼明白这一点
'Cause you'll lose, and Danny knows it.

789
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,340
如果上了法庭我就要追查到底
If we do go to court, I'm gonna have to go all the way.

790
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,760
他们就得承担所有罪名…
They're gonna be charged with a whole truckload...

791
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,430
谋杀，共谋，行为不当
murder, conspiracy, conduct unbecoming.

792
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,890
在球场上他能赢我，可他知道…
Even though he's got me by the balls out here, Danny knows...

793
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,270
上了法庭他准会输
that in a courtroom, he loses this case.

794
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,270
丹尼是个天才横溢的律师
Danny is an awfully talented lawyer.

795
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,770
既然知道当事人六个月就能回家…
He's not about to see his clients go to jail for life...

796
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,360
就不会让他们蹲一辈子监狱
when he knows they can be home in six months.

797
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,990
协商到此为止
That's the end of this negotiation.

798
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,280
明早传讯时见
I'll see you tomorrow morning at the arraignment.

799
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,580
好了，情况是这样
All right. Here's the story.

800
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:11,330
政府提出以过失杀人罪判处两年刑期
The government's offering involuntary manslaughter, two years.

801
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,340
六个月后就能回家
Be home in six months.

802
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,630
哇，凯菲，你是世上最了不起的律师
Wow, Kaffee! You're the greatest lawyer in the world!

803
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,760
我们该怎么谢你呢？
Ooh, how can we ever thank you?

804
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,390
伙计们，你们听到我说什么了吧？
Fellas, you hear what I just said?

805
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,730
你们六个月后就能自由
You're going home in six months.

806
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,150
我恐怕不能接受，长官
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

807
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,570
接受什么？ 协商解决，长官
Do what? Make a deal, sir.

808
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,030
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

809
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,990
我们没做错什么，长官 我们只是恪守本份…
We did nothing wrong, sir. We did our job...

810
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:42,240
如果要因此而我会承受的
and if that has consequences, then I'll accept them.

811
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,700
但我不会承认有罪，长官
But I won't say that I'm guilty, sir.

812
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:49,580
是你…是不是她让你们这么说的？
Did you... Did she put you up to this?

813
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,170
这是我们的准则，长官 哦，令人激动
We have a code, sir. Oh, well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!

814
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:56,590
你依你的准则申请无罪 就得在牢里过下半辈子
You and your code plead not guilty. You'll be in jail the rest of your life.

815
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,720
照我说的做六个月后就能回家
Do what I'm telling you, you'll be home in six months.

816
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,510
接受吧，哈罗德，六个月
Do it, Harold. Six months.

817
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,100
算不了什么，一个冰球赛季而已
It's nothing. It's a hockey season.

818
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,270
请允许我… 说吧
Permission to... Speak!

819
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,440
老天
Jesus!

820
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,860
我们以后怎么办，长官？ 什么以后？
What do we do then, sir? When?

821
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,990
六个月后，会被不荣誉解职是吧？长官
After six months, we'll be dishonorably discharged, right, sir?

822
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,320
有可能
Probably.

823
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,570
那时我们怎么办，长官？
Well, what do we do then, sir?

824
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,210
我们入伍是为了按一种明确的法规来生活
We joined the Marines because we wanted to live our lives by a certain code.

825
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,000
我们在部队感受到了
And we found it in the Corps.

826
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,340
现在你却要我们签字承认自己是不光彩的
Now you're asking us to sign a piece of paper that says we have no honor.

827
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,590
要我们承认不是陆战队员
You're asking us to say we're not Marines.

828
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,970
如果法庭判决我们犯了错…
If a court decides that what we did was wrong...

829
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,050
不管什么处罚我都接受
then I'll accept whatever punishment they give.

830
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:47,640
但我相信没做错，长官 我只是履行了自己的职责…
But I believe I was right, sir. I believe I did my job...

831
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,020
我不会为了六个月后能回家…
and I will not dishonor myself, my unit or the Corps...

832
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,190
而让自己，自己的单位和部队蒙羞…
so that I can go home in six months...

833
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,650
长官
sir.

834
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,780
少校，请让我和道森下士 单独聊一会行吗？
Commander, I'd like to talk to Lance Corporal Dawson alone for a minute.

835
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,120
中士
Sergeant.

836
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,710
我们去其他房间
We're gonna go to another room.

837
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,130
我们要去其他监禁室 好的，夫人
We'd like another holding room. All right, ma'am.

838
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,630
不会有问题 坐吧
It's gonna be okay. Sit down.

839
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,100
你很讨厌我是不是？
You don't like me very much, do you?

840
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,650
算了，不必回答，没关系
Forget it. Don't answer that. It doesn't matter.

841
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,240
知道吗…
You know...

842
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,530
多尼很尊敬你
Downey worships you.

843
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,830
你怎么做他就会怎么做
He's gonna do whatever you do.

844
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,580
你真的愿意因为一条准则 而让他受一辈子牢狱之灾吗，哈罗德？
Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code, Harold?

845
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,090
你觉得我们有错吗？ 问题不在这…
Do you think we were right? It doesn't matter...

846
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:06,300
你觉得我们有没有错？ 我觉得你们会输
Do you think we were right? I think you'd lose.

847
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,090
你是个懦夫
You're such a coward.

848
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,760
真不明白怎么会让你穿上军装
I can't believe they let you wear a uniform.

849
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,770
我的责任到此为止，我已经尽了力
I'm not gonna feel responsible for this. I did everything I could.

850
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,350
你去监狱过你的美好生活好了
You're going to Leavenworth for the better part of your life.

851
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,360
和我没半点关系
And you know what? I don't give a shit.

852
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,450
长官离开房间时你怎么不敬礼？
What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?

853
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,540
开门
Open it up.

854
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,330
真不敢相信，真不敢相信
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

855
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,930
就因为恨我他宁可去监狱
Dawson's gonna go to jail just to spite me.

856
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,560
没问题，他想自寻死路是他的事
Fine. If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business.

857
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,390
我可不想陪他去送死 怎样才能给他另找个律师？
I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way. I wanna get him a new lawyer. How?

858
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,900
明早传讯时提出申请就是
Just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment.

859
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,940
法官会问你是否要提出答辩…
The judge will ask you if you want to enter a plea...

860
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,440
你就说希望另行指派律师
and you tell him that you want to have new counsel assigned.

861
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,360
就这样吧
That's that.

862
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,780
还有，当你要求法官另找律师时…
One thing, though. When you ask the judge for new counsel...

863
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,740
丹尼，记住一定要客气点
Danny, be sure and ask nicely.

864
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,500
你想要我怎么做？ 要你让他们接受庭审
What doyou want from me? I want you to let them be judged.

865
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,460
要你站起来进行辩护
I want you to stand up and make an argument.

866
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,210
辩护对屠杀越南人的战犯没用
An argument that didn't work for Calley at My Lai.

867
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,380
对纽伦堡的纳粹分子也没用
An argument that didn't work for the Nazis at Nuremburg.

868
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,380
看在上帝份上，山姆
Oh, for Christ's sake, Sam.

869
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,880
你真认为这是一码事吗？
Do you really think that's the same as two teenage Marines...

870
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,760
他们从不怀疑执行命令有什么错
executing a routine order they never believed would result in harm?

871
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,510
他们可不是纳粹分子
These guys aren't the Nazis.

872
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,680
现在争没用，丹尼，除非你上庭辩护
Don't look now, Danny, but you're making an argument.

873
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,810
是啊，是啊，明早我就给他们找个新律师
Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning I get them a new attorney.

874
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,810
你干嘛这样害怕做律师？
Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer?

875
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,400
是你父亲的期望太高了吗？
Were Daddy's expectations really that high?

876
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,070
得了，别跟我来这套父父子子的激将法
Oh, please. Spare me the psycho-babble father bullshit!

877
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,530
他们会有满意的结果，不过要靠别的律师
Dawson and Downey will have their day in court, but with another lawyer.

878
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,580
别的律师不够好，他们需要你
Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you.

879
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,210
你知道怎么赢 你知道他们有冤情，你知道怎么才能赢
You know how to win. You know they have a case, and you know how to win.

880
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,710
你一走了之等于决定了他们的命运
If you walk away from this now, you've sealed their fate.

881
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,130
圣地亚哥身亡之时 他们的命运就已经注定了
Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died.

882
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:04,970
你相信他们有冤情吗？ 你和道森都活在梦想世界里
Do you believe they have a case? You and Dawson. You both live in the same dream world.

883
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,970
问题不在于我相信什么
It doesn't matter what I believe.

884
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,180
而在于我能证明什么
It only matters what I can prove.

885
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,180
所以别说我知道什么不知道什么
So, please, don't tell me what I know and don't know!

886
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,980
我只知道法律
I know the law!

887
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,900
你对法律一无所知
You know nothing about the law.

888
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,190
你是个二手车推销员，丹尼
You're a used car salesman, Daniel.

889
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,780
你做律师只配处理交通纠纷
You're an ambulance chaser with a rank.

890
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,950
一无是处是你的谋生之道
You're nothing. Live with that.

891
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,370
所以我告诉邓肯…
So I told Duncan...

892
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,670
如果你想上庭，我会申请要求取证…
"If you wanna take this to court I'm gonna file nine discovery motions...

893
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:48,590
你就得因为一个九旬老翁看错特拉华州 的保险条款花上一年时间来组织书面材料
and you're gonna spend a year going blind on paperwork... because a 90-year-old man misread the Delaware insurance code."

894
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,850
然后呢？ 十五分钟后他回了电话
So what happened? He calls back 15 minutes later.

895
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,850
他说“庭外和解好了”
He says, "Let's make a deal."

896
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,440
全体起立
All rise.

897
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,030
哪个案子？
Where are we?

898
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,330
诉讼号 411275VR-5 一案
Docket number 411275VR-5.

899
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,450
美国政府起诉哈罗德・道森准下士…
The United States v. Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson...

900
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,500
和一等兵劳登・多尼
and Private First Class Louden Downey.

901
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,750
罪名为谋杀，同谋策划谋杀…
The accused are charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder...

902
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,380
以及对一名陆战队员行为不当
and conduct unbecoming a United States Marine.

903
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,630
辩方有什么意见吗？
Does the defense wish to enter a plea?

904
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,800
是的
Yeah.

905
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:16,930
他们没有罪
They're not guilty.

906
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,730
提请进行无罪答辩
Enter a plea of not guilty for the accused.

907
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:26,060
现在宣布休庭，三周后上午十点…
We'll adjourn until 1000, three weeks from today...

908
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,110
在最高军事法庭重新开庭审理
at which time this general court-martial will reconvene.

909
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,130
为什么一名只有九个月经验 和资历的中尉…
Why does a lieutenant junior grade with ninth months'experience...

910
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,590
会被指派为一起谋杀案作辩护律师？
and a track record for plea bargaining get assigned a murder case?

911
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,430
难道这样就能避免对簿公堂吗？
Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom?

912
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,930
晚上七点到我家找找答案
We'll work out of my apartment every night, 7:00.

913
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:07,650
乔，记住带一盒便笺 六盒红笔和六盒黑笔
Jo, pick up a carton of legal pads, half a dozen boxes of red and black pens.

914
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,940
山姆，带几盏台灯来 准备一份初步的验尸报告
Sam, get a couple of desk lamps. I need a preliminary medical profile.

915
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:15,450
乔，把道森，多尼和圣地亚哥 所有的训练审核报告找来
Jo, we need all proficiency and conduct reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago.

916
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:17,700
我只有可可饮料和汽水…
The only thing I have to eat is Yoo-hoo and Cocoa Puffs...

917
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,700
想要其他饮料自己带
so if you want anything else, bring it with you.

918
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,950
行吗？ 好的
Okay? Yeah.

919
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,460
原来法庭就是这个样子
So this is what a courtroom looks like.

920
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,470
你和海军调查处的朋友说过吗？
Were you able to speak to your friend at the N.I. S?

921
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,810
说过，她说如果马金森不想被找到…
Yeah. She said if Markinson doesn't want to be found...

922
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,730
我们就别想找到他
we're not gonna find him.

923
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:52,780
哪怕马金森就在你面前你也认不出
She said I could be Markinson, and you wouldn't know it.

924
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,400
你是马金森吗？
Are you Markinson?

925
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,570
不是，我也不是马金森
I'm not Markinson.

926
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,830
那你我都排除在外了
That's two down.

927
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,790
怎么了？
What?

928
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,340
我想知道，现在有乔安妮帮忙…
I'm just wondering, now that Joanne's on this...

929
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,920
你是不是还需要我
I'm just wondering if you still need me.

930
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,800
他们只是执行命令 是不合法的命令
They were following orders. An illegal order.

931
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,090
你认为他们知道这命令不合法吗？
Do you think they knew it was an illegal order?

932
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,510
问题在于凡是正直的人都会拒绝…
It doesn't matter what they knew. Any decent person would have refused...

933
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,850
他们无权怀疑上级的命令
They're not permitted to question orders.

934
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,940
那干嘛要偷偷摸摸？干嘛要用代码？
Then what's the secret? Huh? What are the magic words?

935
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,560
我每天都下命令…
I give orders every day...

936
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,610
我们有棒球比赛和军乐队
We have softball games and marching bands.

937
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:36,940
可他们呆的地方得穿迷彩服 不然就可能被当成靶子
They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot!

938
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,660
我需要你
I need you.

939
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,790
做调查你比我强 而且你知道怎样安排证人
You're better at research than I am, and you know how to prepare a witness.

940
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,260
我带来了验尸报告，还有中餐，先吃点吧
I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first.

941
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,770
怎么了？
What?

942
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,940
有没有宫保鸡丁？
You got any kung pao chicken?

943
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,870
我们要强调的是… 没人能证明那块抹布下过毒
This is our defense... intent. No one can prove there was poison on the rag.

944
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:22,790
“红色条规”在关达那摩湾见怪不怪
Code Red... they're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay.

945
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:27,250
而命令…Ａ：是肯德瑞克下的 Ｂ：他们必须服从
The order... A: Kendrick gave it, B: They had to follow it.

946
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,420
就这些 动机呢？
That's it. What about motive?

947
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,500
这一点我们处于下风
We're a little weak on motive. They had one.

948
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,760
这并不表示他们有罪 别激动
That doesn't mean they're guilty. Relax.

949
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,220
我们会应付好开枪事件
We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up.

950
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,430
开始吧，别管圣地亚哥的具体死因…
Let's start with intent. I don't want to know what made Santiago die.

951
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:42,430
只需要证明有可能是毒药之外的因素
I just want to show it could've been something other than poison.

952
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:46,100
乔，找医生了解和乳酸中毒有关的一切
Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis.

953
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,440
我是华盛顿最高军法处的盖洛维少校
This is Lieutenant Commander Galloway with the JAG Corps in Washington.

954
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,780
我想找出马修・马金森中校的下落
I've been trying to track down a Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

955
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,650
医生，有没有任何外伤？
Doctor, was there any sign of external damage?

956
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:00,240
没有擦伤？没有伤口？淤伤和骨折呢？
No scrapes? No cuts? Bruises? Broken bones?

957
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,660
有没有暴力痕迹？ 难道死亡还不足以证明吗？
Was there any sign of violence? You mean, other than the dead body?

958
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,500
见鬼，我忽略了该死的时间问题
Shit, I walk into that every goddamn time.

959
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,210
他命令我和道森准下士 对威廉执行“红色条规”
He ordered me and Lance Corporal Dawson to give Willie a Code Red.

960
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,510
回答还得更快一些
Answers still have to come much faster.

961
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:19,140
马马虎虎，但最后一句 听起来感觉象在编造事实
This Iowa farm boy thing will play for a while... but in the end, it sounds like he's searching for the truth.

962
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,470
没错，要说“一等兵圣地亚哥”
He's right. From now on, Willie is Private Santiago.

963
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:26,180
别说“威廉”，那会让陪审团产生 对我们不利的情绪，懂吗？
You start calling him Willie, and all of a sudden he's a person... who's got a mother who's gonna miss him, okay?

964
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,190
下午已经拟定了陪审团
They drew the court members this afternoon.

965
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,560
七男两女，五个海军，四个陆战队员
Seven men, two women, five Navy, four Marines.

966
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,150
全是资深军官，两个女的都有孩子
All officers with line experience. Neither of the women have children.

967
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,530
不太妙，我们对此无能为力
That's a bad break. There's nothing we can do.

968
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:38,360
有陪审团就不单纯是法律的问题了
My father always said a jury trial is not just about the law.

969
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,620
而圣地亚哥的无辜身亡会让…
It's about assigning blame. Santiago's dead, and he shouldn't be.

970
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:44,540
陪审团主张有人得为此承担罪责
These nine people are gonna insist that someone be blamed for that.

971
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,080
是当事人还是肯德瑞克…
Ross is handing them our clients. We're gonna hand them Kendrick.

972
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,710
就得看律师如何“推销”自己的观点了
This is about a sales pitch. It's gonna be won by the lawyers.

973
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:54,050
记住表情要严肃，在陪审团面前不要畏缩
So remember, poker faces. Don't flinch in front of the court members.

974
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:57,880
态度要强硬，别低着头如坐针毡
Something doesn't go our way, don't hang your head or shift in your seat.

975
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,720
不管出现什么意外都要让人感觉成竹在胸
Whatever happens, you have to look like it's exactly what you knew would happen.

976
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,390
递文件给我时… 动作要迅速而从容
If you pass me documents... Do it swiftly and don't look eager.

977
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,600
上庭时别打香水，那会分散我的注意力
Don't wear that perfume in court. Wrecks my concentration.

978
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,060
真的吗？
Really?

979
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,520
我是说山姆
I was talking to Sam.

980
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,230
几点了？
What time is it?

981
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,320
该回家了，好好睡一觉
It's time to go home. Try to get some sleep.

982
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,450
能送我一程吗？
Yeah. Give me a ride?

983
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,910
没问题
Sure.

984
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:27,080
你真是个好人，查理布朗（卡通人物）
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

985
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,660
法庭上见，大律师
I'll seeyou in court, counselor.

986
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,590
丹尼，我… 不用说了
Danny, I... You don't have to say it.

987
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:41,050
我们有过分歧，我说过一些无心的话
We've had our differences. I said some things I didn't mean.

988
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:44,510
你也是，但你很高兴我能接下这个案子
You said some things you didn't mean, but you're happy I stuck with the case.

989
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:48,980
如果过去三周以来 你对我多了一些敬意…
And if you've gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks...

990
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,100
我当然会为此而高兴
of course, I'm happy about that.

991
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,270
但用不着太放在心上
But we don't have to make a whole big deal out of it.

992
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:55,610
你喜欢我我也不会要求你说出来
If you like me, I won't make you say it.

993
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:59,150
我只是想提醒你明天别穿错袜子
I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow.

994
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:04,370
好的，很重要提示
Okay. Good tip.

995
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,370
那就万事俱备了
We're ready.

996
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,910
最好相信这一点
Better believe it.

997
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,760
我们要大获全胜
We're gonna get creamed.

998
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,370
凯菲中尉？ 什么事？
Lieutenant Kaffee? Yes?

999
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,790
你会救我们的儿子对吧？
You are gonna save our son, aren't you?

1000
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,170
我会尽力而为
I'll do my best.

1001
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,760
丹尼，我给你介绍一下 劳登的姨妈詹妮・米勒
Danny, I'd like you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt.

1002
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,640
你就是詹妮姨妈？
You're Aunt Ginny? Uh-huh.

1003
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,020
不好意思，没想到你这么年轻
I'm sorry. I was expecting someone older.

1004
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,770
彼此彼此
So was I.

1005
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,900
给个机会掷硬币定输赢吧
Last chance. I'll flip you for it.

1006
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,400
全体起立 太晚了
All rise. Too late.

1007
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:33,080
最高军事法庭，请所有在场人员…
All those having business with this general court-martial...

1008
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,710
坐到前面来，主持审判的是…
stand forward and you shall be heard.

1009
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,250
朱利叶斯・亚历山大・伦道夫将军
Colonel Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding.

1010
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,880
控方准备好作公开陈述了吗？
Is the government prepared to make an opening statement?

1011
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,340
是的，大人
Yes, sir.

1012
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:48,760
本案事实如下：
The facts of the case are these:

1013
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,640
九月六日午夜，被告潜入其队友…
On midnight of September 6, the accused entered the barracks room...

1014
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,680
一等兵威廉・圣地亚哥的房间
of their platoon mate, P.F.C. William Santiago.

1015
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,850
将其弄醒后捆住其手脚…
They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with tape...

1016
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:00,150
并强行将一块抹布塞进他的喉咙
and forced a rag into his throat.

1017
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,860
几分钟后 一种名为“乳酸中毒”的化学反应…
A few minutes later, a chemical reaction called lactic acidosis...

1018
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,030
导致其肺部出血…
caused his lungs to begin bleeding.

1019
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:08,030
因此而窒息…
He drowned in his own blood...

1020
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:11,740
至午夜十二点三十七分被确认死亡
and was pronounced dead at 37 minutes past midnight.

1021
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:16,870
以上为本案事实经过，绝无虚假
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.

1022
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:20,540
各位将会听到被告道森准下士…
That's right. The story I've just told you...

1023
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:24,210
以及一等兵多尼的陈述…
is the exact same story you're gonna hear from Lance Corporal Dawson...

1024
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:27,010
与我刚才所说的完全一致
and it's the exact same story you're gonna hear from Private Downey.

1025
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:29,760
此外，我将向各位证实…
Furthermore, the government will also demonstrate...

1026
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,260
被告在抹布上下过毒…
that the accused soaked the rag in poison...

1027
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,520
而且是怀着杀人动机潜入圣地亚哥的房间
and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.

1028
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,850
现在，凯菲中尉…
Now, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1029
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,070
会努力玩弄一些小魔术来混淆视听
is gonna try and pull off a little magic act here.

1030
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,610
他会用令人震惊的所谓“军规”…
He's gonna try a little misdirection.

1031
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:49,410
某些听起来很正式的术语…
He's gonna astonish you with stories of rituals...

1032
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:52,410
试着误导在场的各位…
and dazzle you with official-sounding terms...

1033
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,370
例如“红色条规”
like "Code Red."

1034
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,790
甚至还有可能牵扯上几位军官
He might even try to cut into a few officers for you.

1035
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:03,750
他没有证据，一点证据都没有 不过会很有娱乐性
He'll have no evidence, mind you, none, but it's gonna be entertaining.

1036
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:07,300
但是最终，世上所有的魔术…
And when we get to the end, all the magic in the world...

1037
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,090
都无法让人忽视一个事实…
will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact...

1038
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:15,770
威廉・圣地亚哥死了 是道森和多尼杀死了他
that Willie Santiago is dead and Dawson and Downey killed him.

1039
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,730
这是本案的事实，是无法否认的
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.

1040
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,070
凯菲中尉
Lieutenant Kaffee.

1041
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:27,070
抹布没下过毒，而且没有杀人动机
There was no poison on the rag, and there was no intent to kill.

1042
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:31,860
不管用什么方式去证明都是徒劳的 因为这不是事实
Any attempt to prove otherwise is futile'cause it just aingt true.

1043
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:35,160
那天夜里道森和多尼 进入圣地亚哥的房间…
When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night...

1044
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,830
不是因为报复或敌意
it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred.

1045
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,620
不是为了杀人或伤人，也不是为了寻开心
It wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks.

1046
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,420
因为他们是奉命行事
It's because it was what they were ordered to do.

1047
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,210
让我重复一次
Let me say that again.

1048
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,430
因为他们是奉命行事
It's because it was what theywere ordered to do.

1049
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,010
在其他地方这无足轻重…
Out in the real world that means nothing...

1050
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:57,310
哪怕在这…海军学院也没什么大不了
and here at the Washington Navy Yard it doesn't mean a whole lot more.

1051
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:01,350
但如果一名 古巴关达那摩湾Ｗ步兵警卫连的…
But if you're a Marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward...

1052
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:04,360
海军陆战队员接到一个命令…
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order...

1053
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,980
不执行就得卷铺盖走人
you follow it or you packyour bags.

1054
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,070
这一点不要弄错
Make no mistake about it.

1055
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:12,410
哈・道森和劳・多尼今天坐在各位面前…
Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you today...

1056
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:15,870
是因为他们履行了自己的职责
because they did their job.

1057
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:21,660
控方要传讯第一个证人吗？
Is the government ready to call its first witness?

1058
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:26,420
庭上，控方请求传召Ｒ・Ｃ・米盖尔先生
If it please the court, the government calls Mr. R.C. McGuire.

1059
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,010
米盖尔先生，请举起你的右手
Mr. McGuire, would you raise your right hand, please?

1060
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:35,850
你愿意发誓你在法庭上…
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give this general court-martial...

1061
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:38,850
所说的一切完全属实，绝无虚假吗？
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1062
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:42,270
我发誓 请坐下，先生
I do. Have a seat, please, sir.

1063
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:45,690
请说出你的全名以及职业
Would you state your full name and occupation, for the record?

1064
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:50,190
罗伯特・Ｃ・米盖尔 海军调查处特别官员
Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent, Naval Investigative Service.

1065
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:54,570
米盖尔先生，今年九月三日 你的办公室是否收到过一等兵…
Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter from P.F.C. William Santiago...

1066
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:56,780
威廉・圣地亚哥的信？
on 3 September of this year?

1067
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,160
是的 信里面说什么？
We did. What did that letter say?

1068
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:03,870
是说他所在单位的一名队员 用所持武器在边界向境外开枪
That a member of Santiago's unit had fired his weapon over the fenceline.

1069
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:06,080
有没有具体说明是谁？
Was that Marine identified in the letter?

1070
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,710
没有，我通知指挥官杰赛普上校…
No. I notified the barracks C.O. Colonel Jessup...

1071
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,760
我将会前往调查
that I would be coming down to investigate.

1072
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,550
调查结果呢？
And what did you find?

1073
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:16,720
记录显示只有一名哨兵归还武器时…
The shift reported only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch...

1074
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,810
少了一发子弹
with a round of ammunition missing.

1075
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:22,100
是谁？ 哈罗德・道森准下士
Who was that? Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.

1076
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,730
该你问了
Your witness.

1077
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,690
米盖尔先生 你向道森询问过开枪事件吗？
Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Dawson about the fenceline shooting?

1078
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:33,740
问过，他声称对方有不利于他的行动
Yes. He claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy.

1079
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,990
你不相信他吗？ 这不关我的…
You don'believe him? It's not my place...

1080
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:41,040
为什么道森准下士触犯了军规却没有 因为无故向敌方开枪受到起诉呢？
Lance Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes. Why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause?

1081
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,710
没有足够的证据来起诉
There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge.

1082
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,670
谢谢
Thank you.

1083
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,880
米盖尔先生，我不明白…
Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what you mean when you say...

1084
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,590
“没有足够的证据”是指什么
"There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge."

1085
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,930
你有威廉・圣地亚哥的信
You had William Santiago's letter.

1086
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,140
圣地亚哥是唯一的目击者
Santiago was the only eyewitness.

1087
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,640
我没来得及询问他 所以不知道他看到了什么
I never had the chance to interview him, so I don't know what he saw.

1088
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,850
我们永远不会知道了，是不是？ 是的
And now we'll never know, will we, Mr. McGuire?

1089
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,440
我问完了 证人请退下
No more questions. The witness is excused.

1090
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,160
海军陆战队Ｗ步兵警卫连二Ｂ排…
Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker, Marine Barracks...

1091
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,490
卡尔・爱德华・汉梅克下士
Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Bravo.

1092
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:29,460
下士，九月六日下午肯德瑞克上尉 召集二排开会时你是否在场？
Corporal, were you present at a meeting that Lieutenant Kendrick held... on the afternoon of September 6 with the members of the Second Platoon?

1093
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,750
在场，长官
Yes, sir.

1094
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:33,460
能说说会议的内容是什么吗？
Would you tell the court the substance of that meeting?

1095
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,720
肯德瑞克上尉说我们排有个告密的…
Lieutenant Kendrick told us we had an informer in our group...

1096
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,470
一等兵圣地亚哥越级…
that Private Santiago had gone outside the chain of command...

1097
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,470
向海军调查处举报排里的一名队员
and reported to the N.I.S. On a member of our platoon.

1098
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:46,480
这是不是让你很气愤？ 你可以说实话，下士
Did that make you mad? You can tell the truth, Corporal.

1099
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,350
你是不是很生气？ 是的，长官
Did it make you mad? Yes, sir.

1100
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,600
有多生气？
How mad?

1101
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:53,570
一等兵圣地亚哥违背了 我们深信不疑的一条规矩，长官
Private Santiago betrayed a code we believe in very deeply, sir.

1102
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:56,650
其他队员有没有生气？ 反对无根据的假设
Were the other squad members angry? Object. Speculation.

1103
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:58,910
比方说道森和多尼？ 控方律师这是在…
Were Dawson and Downey? Is the government counsel...

1104
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:03,530
直接要求证人证实我当事人的想法吗？
honestly asking the witness to testify as to how my clients felt?

1105
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,540
反对有效
Sustained.

1106
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:11,330
下士，肯德瑞克上尉 在会上是否下过什么命令？
Corporal, did Lieutenant Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting?

1107
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,500
是的，长官 什么命令？
Yes, sir. What was it?

1108
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:19,340
他明令我们不得擅自处理这件事
Well, it was clear that he didn't want us taking matters into our own hands.

1109
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,390
是什么命令？
What was the order?

1110
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,270
长官，他说不许碰圣地亚哥
Sir, he said Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1111
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:29,350
该你问了
Your witness.

1112
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:34,360
汉梅克下士，散会五分钟后 你是否去过道森和多尼的房间？
Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson and Downey's barracks... five minutes after this meeting?

1113
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,980
没有，长官
No, sir.

1114
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,740
谢谢，我问完了
Thanks. I have no more questions.

1115
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,860
证人请退下
The witness is excused.

1116
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,040
控方请求传雷蒙德・汤马斯下士
The government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas.

1117
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,330
我知道罗斯上尉是打算传召…
I understand Captain Ross is planning on calling all the other members...

1118
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,040
Ｗ步兵警卫连的所有队员来作证
of Rifle Security Company Windward to testify.

1119
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,290
显然凯菲中尉的辩护重点…
In light of the defense Lieutenant Kaffee is planning to mount...

1120
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:59,300
和排长的明确指示有相当大的关系
the explicit instructions of a platoon leader seems particularly relevant.

1121
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,880
辩方可以同意全部二十二名证人…
The defense is willing to concede that all 22 witnesses...

1122
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,260
的证词和汉梅克下士基本一致…
will testify substantially as Corporal Hammaker did...

1123
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,720
只要控方同意九月六日下午四点二十分…
if the government is willing to concede that none of them...

1124
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,390
他们谁都不在道森和多尼的房间
were in Dawson and Downey's room at 16:20 on September 6.

1125
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,400
上尉？
Captain?

1126
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,940
控方可以同意
The government will stipulate.

1127
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,990
现在休庭，你可以 明天传讯你的下一位证人
Then we'll adjourn for the day. You can call your next witness tomorrow.

1128
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,990
全体起立
All rise.

1129
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,380
我要再演习一下医生那段
I want to go over the doctor again.

1130
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,340
还是直接了当吧 那我们已经演习过了
We're taking the right approach. We've been over this already.

1131
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:41,010
听我说，三点钟时斯通医生 还说不知道圣地亚哥的死因
Listen to me. 3:00... Stone says he doesn't know what killed Santiago.

1132
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,760
等见过杰赛普之后 五点钟时他却说是中毒
Then he meets with Jessup, and at 5:00 he says it was poison?

1133
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,600
医生没有说实话 哦，真是个救星
The doctor's not telling the truth. Oh, that's a relief!

1134
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,770
但我作辩时总不能说他是在撒谎吧
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use the "liar, liar, pants on fire" defense.

1135
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:55,770
我们无法证明他受过胁迫 还是温习一下手头掌握的材料吧
We can't prove coercion. Let's go over what we have, okay?

1136
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:09,660
一等兵圣地亚哥 是零点十二分分送到急救室的…
Private Santiago was admitted to the E.R. At 0012...

1137
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:13,290
在零点三十七分被确认死亡
and he was pronounced dead at 0037.

1138
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:16,540
斯通医生，什么是乳酸中毒？
Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?

1139
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,750
如果 肌肉及人体的其他细胞燃烧的是糖…
If the muscles and other cells of the body burn sugar...

1140
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,670
而不是氧，体内就会产生乳酸
instead of oxygen, lactic acid is produced.

1141
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:26,180
正是乳酸导致了圣地亚哥肺出血
That lactic acid is what caused Santiago's lungs to bleed.

1142
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,180
通常肌肉和其他细胞要多长时间…
Normally, how long does it take for the muscles and other cells...

1143
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,680
才开始燃烧糖而不是氧？
to begin burning sugar instead of oxygen?

1144
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,310
二十到三十分钟
Twenty to thirty minutes.

1145
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:38,150
是什么原因 加速了圣地亚哥肌肉的这种反应？
And what caused this process to be sped up in Santiago's muscles?

1146
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:40,360
某种摄入性中毒
An ingested poison of some kind.

1147
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,490
法官大人，我反对，证人是在推断
Your Honor, we object at this point. The witness is speculating.

1148
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:45,610
斯通中校是医学专家
Commander Stone is an expert medical witness.

1149
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,160
他的观点不能认为是推断
In this courtroom, his opinion is not considered speculation.

1150
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,240
斯通中校是内科医生，不是犯罪学专家
Commander Stone is an internist, not a criminologist.

1151
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,870
医学事实在法庭上不是决定性的
The medical facts here are ultimately inconclusive.

1152
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:57,670
我相信你可以通过交互提问证明这一点
A point I'm confident you'll illustrate to the court under cross-examination.

1153
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:00,880
所以应该不介意我们暂时认可其观点
So I'm sure you won't mind if his opinion is admitted now.

1154
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,710
当然，大人
Not at all, sir.

1155
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:09,390
斯通医生 威廉・圣地亚哥是死于中毒吗？
Dr. Stone, did Willie Santiago die of poisoning?

1156
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,140
毫无疑问
Absolutely.

1157
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:15,350
你知道化验室和验尸官的报告 都显示没有毒药的痕迹吗？
You're aware that the lab and coroner's report show no traces of poison?

1158
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,940
知道 那你怎么证明…
Yes, I am. Then how do you justify...

1159
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,980
严格说来有很多种毒素…
There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable...

1160
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:23,690
在人体组织中是无法检测到的
both in the human body and on a fabric.

1161
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:27,490
在这一案例中酸中毒症状是显而易见的
The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor on this issue.

1162
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,200
谢谢，长官
Thank you, sir.

1163
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,500
中校，如果有人患了某种病…
Commander, is it possible for a person to have an affliction...

1164
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,000
在某种情形下… 有没有可能加速酸中毒的过程呢？
some sort of condition... which might speed up the process of acidosis?

1165
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:44,510
有可能吗，中校？
Commander, is it possible?

1166
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,420
有可能
It's possible.

1167
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:48,930
在什么情形下呢？
What might some of those conditions be?

1168
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:52,510
如果患有冠状动脉紊乱…
If a person had a coronary disorder...

1169
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:55,640
或是大脑紊乱，就会加速该过程
or a cerebral disorder, the process would be more rapid.

1170
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,730
如果我有冠状动脉问题 在嘴里塞上一块干净的抹布…
If I had a coronary condition and a clean rag was placed in my mouth...

1171
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:03,570
塞得非常深，我的细胞是否有可能…
and the rag was pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells...

1172
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:06,400
在拿掉抹布后继续燃烧糖分呢？
would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out?

1173
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,410
那得是病情非常严重的情况下
It would have to be a very serious condition.

1174
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,700
是否有可能病情非常严重…
Is it possible to have a serious coronary condition...

1175
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:15,240
但症状很轻微，以至于在常规的…
where the warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician...

1176
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,830
体检时被医生忽略呢？
during a routine medical exam?

1177
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:21,170
有可能，但还是会有迹象
Possibly. There would still be symptoms, though.

1178
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:23,590
何种迹象？ 有好几百种…
What kind of symptoms? There are hundreds...

1179
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,920
胸口疼？ 是的
Chest pains? Yes.

1180
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,920
气喘？ 是的
Shortness of breath? Yes.

1181
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,430
疲劳？ 当然
Fatigue? Of course.

1182
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:37,980
医生，这是你的签名吗？
Doctor, is this your signature?

1183
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,690
是的
Yes, it is.

1184
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,150
这上面表明 应限制给圣地亚哥分配任务
This is an order for Private Santiago to be put on restrictive duty.

1185
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:49,150
请你读一下你写在下面的备注好吗？
Would you read your handwritten remarks at the bottom of the page, please?

1186
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:53,450
初步测试，阴性，患者胸口疼痛…
"Initial testing, negative. Patient complains of chest pains...

1187
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,660
气喘且易疲劳
shortness of breath and fatigue.

1188
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,540
每周跑步的距离应限制在五英里以内
Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week."

1189
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,840
中校，有没有可能 圣地亚哥患有严重的疾病…
Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago had a serious condition...

1190
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:12,300
而这种疾病会导致化学反应的加速？ 不会
and it was that condition that caused the accelerated chemical reaction?

1191
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,140
不可能吗？
It's not possible?

1192
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,180
是的，我亲自给每个人 做过彻底的身体检查
I personally give each man a thorough physical examination.

1193
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,350
一等兵圣地亚哥各方面都很健康
Private Santiago was given a clean bill of health.

1194
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:24,980
所以非得是中毒对吧，中校？
That's why it had to be poison, right, Commander?

1195
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:29,150
因为如果你让一个 冠状动脉有严重问题的人出任务…
'Cause if you put a man with a serious coronary condition on duty...

1196
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:31,650
而这人死于与心脏有关的事故…
and that man died from a heart-related incident...

1197
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,740
你就会有大麻烦，是吗？
you'd have a lot to answer for, wouldn't you, Doctor?

1198
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,870
反对，请求驳回 反对有效
Object! Move to strike. Sustained.

1199
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,080
我问完了，法官先生
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

1200
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:44,830
斯通医生，你获得行医执照已有十七年
Dr. Stone, you've held a medical license for 17 years.

1201
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,090
通过了内科医学委员会的鉴定
You're Board-certified in internal medicine.

1202
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:52,720
在一家为五千四百二十六人服务的医院 任内科主管
You are chief of internal medicine at a hospital which serves 5,426 people.

1203
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:57,680
以你的医学专业观点来看 圣地亚哥是死于中毒吗？
In your professional medical opinion, was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1204
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,480
辩方重申反对斯通中校的证词…
We renew our objection to Commander Stone's testimony...

1205
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,640
并要求从笔录中撤回
and ask that it be stricken from the record.

1206
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:06,690
请求陪审团对该证人的证词不予考虑
We further ask the court members to lend no weight to this witness's testimony.

1207
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,360
反对无效，予以驳回
The objection is overruled.

1208
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,570
辩方强烈反对并要求进行合议…
The defense strenuously objects and requests an 802 conference...

1209
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:16,780
这样庭上可以有机会在判决前听到辩论
so that His Honor might have a chance to hear discussion before ruling.

1210
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:20,370
辩方的反对我已经听到，反对无效
The objection of the defense has been heard and overruled.

1211
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:23,120
请求重新考虑 你的反对已被记录下来
Move to reconsider. Your objection is noted.

1212
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,170
该证人是一位专家，法庭要听听他的观点
The witness is an expert, and the court will hear his opinion!

1213
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:36,220
斯通医生，以你的专业经验所见…
Dr. Stone, in your expert, professional opinion...

1214
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:39,060
威廉・圣地亚哥是死于中毒吗？
was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1215
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,060
是的
Yes.

1216
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:44,890
谢谢，长官，我问完了
Thank you, sir. I have no more questions.

1217
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,020
中校，你可以下去了
Commander, you may step down.

1218
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:57,620
控方请求休庭 同时请求保留传讯特别证人的权力
Please the court, while we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses... the government rests.

1219
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:01,330
本案押后至十九日星期一上午十点再审…
We'll stand in recess until 1000, Monday the 19th...

1220
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:04,830
届时请辩方传第一证人出庭
at which time, the defense will call its first witness.

1221
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:06,830
全体起立
All rise.

1222
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,050
“我强烈反对”？
"I strenuously object"?

1223
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:22,390
那有什么用？ “反对予以驳回”
Is that how it works? "Objection overruled."

1224
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:24,600
“不，不…我坚持反对”
"No, no. I strenuously object."

1225
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,150
“哦，既然你坚持反对 那我会予以重新考虑
"Oh, well, if you strenuously object, then I should take time to reconsider."

1226
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,770
至少记入了笔录
I got it on the record.

1227
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,070
可也让陪审团以为我们怕那个医生
You also got the court members thinking we're afraid of the doctor.

1228
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:34,860
反对一次就能让人知道他不是犯罪学专家
You object once, so they can hear us say he's not a criminologist.

1229
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:38,570
不断重申就让人感觉 这是律师的古怪花招了
You keep after it, and suddenly it looks like a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks.

1230
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:41,740
书上的法律和庭上的法律是两回事
It's the difference between paper law and trial law.

1231
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,290
结果法官只好强调斯通是专家
You even had the judge saying Stone was an expert!

1232
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:47,250
她已经犯了错，我们不要再提了
She made a mistake. Let's not relive it.

1233
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,550
我要给我妻子打电话，晚上见
I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll see you tonight.

1234
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:57,050
你为什么这样恨他们？
Why do you hate them so much?

1235
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,590
他们以强凌弱，这是事实
They beat up on a weakling. That's all they did.

1236
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:02,680
其他的全都是废话
The rest of this is just smoke-filled coffee house crap.

1237
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,890
他们折磨过一个虚弱的年轻人
They tortured and tormented a weaker kid!

1238
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:07,980
因为不喜欢他就杀了他
They didn't like him, so they killed him.

1239
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:10,980
为什么？因为他跑得不快
And why? Because he couldn't run very fast!

1240
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:14,690
好了，今晚大家都休息吧
All right. Everybody take the night off.

1241
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,690
对不起 我知道
I'm sorry. I know.

1242
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:19,530
我们连着三周半每天工作二十个小时
We've been working 20 hours a day for three and halfweeks straight.

1243
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:22,990
就休息一晚，去看看你太太和女儿
Just take the night off. Go see your wife, your daughter.

1244
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:25,200
乔，你去…
Jo, go do...

1245
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:30,080
反正不用来，你想干什么就干什么吧
whatever it is you do when you're not here.

1246
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,840
明天星期几？ 星期六
What day is tomorrow? Saturday.

1247
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,840
我们十点碰头
We start at 10:00.

1248
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,180
你为什么这样维护他们？
Why do you like them so much?

1249
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,640
因为他们在守卫边疆…
'Cause they stand on a wall...

1250
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:52,020
而且保证 “今晚有我站岗，没什么能伤害你们”
and they say, "Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight, not on my watch."

1251
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,900
别担心那个医生，审判要星期一才开始
Don't worry about the doctor. This trial starts Monday.

1252
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:09,080
有两人出局，安达将球击向左中场
1 and 2 with two out. Anda line drive to left center.

1253
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,380
克比上垒失败
Kirby racing. He won't get there.

1254
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:18,840
第三个跑垒员是卡尔・瑞普肯…
And rounding third is Cal Ripken... and the Twins'streak is over.

1255
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,720
第三个跑垒员是卡尔・瑞普肯…
One strike away, and Randy Milligan feels right now like Hulk Hogan.

1256
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:32,060
很抱歉打扰你，我该先打个电话
I'm sorry to bother you. I should've called first.

1257
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:36,610
没关系，我只是在看球赛，进来吧
No, I was just watching a ball game. Come on in.

1258
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:56,920
我是想…你愿意和我一起去吃晚饭吗？
I was wondering if... How you'd feel about my taking you to dinner tonight?

1259
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,960
你是想和我约会吗？ 不是
Are you asking me out on a date? No.

1260
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,050
听上去你是想约我 不是
Sounded like you were asking me on a date.

1261
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:05,180
以前有人约过我，听起来就是那个意思
I've been asked out on dates before, and that's what it sounded like.

1262
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:08,600
喜欢海鲜吗？我知道一个好地方
Do you like seafood? I know a good seafood place.

1263
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,530
我第三件案子是一起酗酒闹事案
My third case was a drunk and disorderly.

1264
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:23,450
花了九个星期 我把那晚在酒吧的三十一个人都找遍了
It lasted nine weeks. I rounded up 31 people from the bar that night.

1265
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:26,950
酗酒闹事花了九个星期？ 控方想怎么判？
Nine weeks on a D and D? What was the prosecutor offering?

1266
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:28,950
十五天
Fifteen days.

1267
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,410
当事人真是免遭大难
You sure hustled the shit out of him.

1268
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,880
后来他们把我调到了内政部
Well, after that they moved me to Internal Affairs.

1269
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,920
不能怪他们 我…
Tough to blame them. Where I have earned...

1270
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,710
得过两枚立功奖章和两次奖状
two meritorious service medals and two letters of commendation.

1271
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:44,840
你干嘛总是和我说你的过去？
Why are you always giving me your resume?

1272
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,600
我想要你承认我是个好律师
Because I want you to think I'm a good lawyer.

1273
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,680
我承认
I do.

1274
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:54,980
不，你没有
No, you don't.

1275
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,690
我觉得你是个了不起的律师
I think you're an exceptional lawyer.

1276
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,160
我注意过陪审团 你能引起他们的共鸣，他们喜欢你
I watch the court members. They respond to you. They like you.

1277
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,830
你令他们信服，我觉得道森和多尼…
I see you convincing them, and I think Dawson and Downey...

1278
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:11,580
的下半辈子就得靠你了
are gonna end up owing their lives toyou.

1279
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,130
乔，我觉得…
Jo, I think...

1280
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:22,510
你应该对我们会输的事实现好心理准备
I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose.

1281
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:25,970
罗斯说的那些都是事实
Ross's opening statement... it was all true.

1282
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:30,930
我们可以暂时假设他们是奉命行事
Let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter... that the guys were given an order.

1283
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,680
但无法证明确有其事
I can't prove it ever happened.

1284
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,230
我们可以继续设法去证明…
We'll keep doing what we're doing and we'll put on a show...

1285
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:41,860
但我们掌握的所有证据 都是两个被指控谋杀的人提供的
but all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder.

1286
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:44,740
我们会找到马金森
We'll find Markinson.

1287
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:49,450
乔，我们会输，而且会输得很惨
Jo, we're gonna lose, and we're gonna lose huge.

1288
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:57,920
古巴关达那摩湾海军陆战队Ｗ连 杰弗瑞・欧文・巴恩斯下士
Corporal Jeffrey Owen Barnes, Marine Barracks Windward... Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1289
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,380
巴恩斯下士，请说明一下 队员会因哪些理由被执行“红色条规”
Corporal Barnes, name some reasons why a Marine would receive a Code Red.

1290
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,840
排里或连队开会时迟到
Being late for platoon or company meetings.

1291
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,800
营房总是乱七八糟，跑步时掉队
Keeping his barracks in disorder. Falling back on a run.

1292
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,390
你接受过“红色条规”吗？ 是的，长官
Have you ever received a Code Red? Yes, sir.

1293
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:16,020
我在进行分组突袭训练时武器滑落了
We were doing seven-man assault drills, and my weapon slipped.

1294
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,400
因为当时气温超过一百度 我的手心全是汗…
It was'cause it was over 100 degrees, and my palms were sweaty...

1295
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:23,110
而我忘了象学过的那样抹上松香
and I'd forgotten to use the resin like we were taught.

1296
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:24,690
结果呢？
What happened?

1297
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:27,860
当天夜里我的队友用毯子蒙住我…
That night, the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me...

1298
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,740
狠狠揍了我五分钟…
took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes...

1299
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:33,410
然后在我的手上涂上胶水
then they poured glue on my hands.

1300
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:37,250
这很管用 因为从那以后我的武器再没有脱过手
And it worked too,'cause I aingt never dropped my weapon since.

1301
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,750
一等兵圣地亚哥开会时迟过到吗？
Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings?

1302
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,920
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1303
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,420
他的营房很乱吗？ 是的，长官
Was his barracks ever in disorder? Yes, sir.

1304
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,800
他跑步时掉过队吗？ 每次都是，长官
Did he ever fall back on a run? All the time, sir.

1305
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:53,260
九月六日晚上之前 他有没有接受过“红色条规”？
Did he ever, prior to the night of September 6, receive a Code Red?

1306
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,760
没有，长官
No, sir.

1307
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:56,930
从来没有？ 没有，长官
Never? No, sir.

1308
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,980
你因为手掌出汗受过一次“红色条规”
You got a Code Red'cause your palms were sweaty.

1309
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:05,190
为什么圣地亚哥 总是拖后腿却没受过一次呢？
Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one?

1310
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:08,610
因为道森不允许，长官
Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

1311
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:11,780
道森不允许
Dawson wouldn't allow it.

1312
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:15,450
大家都对圣地亚哥很凶，但没有碰过他
The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they wouldn't go near him.

1313
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,450
因为都很怕道森
They were too afraid of Dawson.

1314
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:20,000
反对，证人是在推断
Object. The witness is speculating.

1315
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,750
我换个问法，杰弗瑞你想过 要对圣地亚哥执行“红色条规”吗？
I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a Code Red?

1316
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,750
是的，长官 为什么没有呢？
Yes, sir. Why didn't you?

1317
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,630
因为道森会收拾我，长官
'Cause Dawson would kick my butt, sir.

1318
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:32,720
很好，现在轮到罗斯上尉问你话了
Good enough. Captain Ross is gonna ask you some questions now.

1319
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:35,930
巴恩斯下士…
Corporal Barnes...

1320
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:39,930
这有本新兵训练用的“陆战队纲要”
I hold here the Marine Outline for Recruit Training.

1321
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:41,730
你熟悉这本书吗？ 是的，长官
Are you familiar with this book? Yes, sir.

1322
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:43,480
你看过没有？ 看过，长官
Have you read it? Yes, sir.

1323
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,900
好的，请你翻到 关于“红色条规”的章节行吗？
Would you turn to the chapter that deals with Code Reds, please?

1324
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:53,030
只要翻到描述“红色条规”的那一页
Just flip to the page of the book that discusses Code Reds.

1325
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,750
要知道，长官 “红色条规”是我们用的一个术语
Well, you see, sir, Code Red is a term that we use.

1326
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,500
只限于关达那摩…
Just down in Gitmo...

1327
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,670
好在还有本书
Oh, we're in luck, then.

1328
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,420
古巴关达那摩湾 步兵警卫连行为规范守则
Standard Operating Procedure, Rifle Security Company, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1329
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:14,510
我猜这本书里 会有“红色条规”的定义条款
I assume we'll find the term Code Red and its definition in that book.

1330
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,390
没有，长官 没有？
No, sir.

1331
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:18,260
下士，难道陆战队员…
Corporal Barnes, I'm a Marine.

1332
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:22,520
没有书，没有手册 也没有制订规章制度…
Is there no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations...

1333
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,110
让大家明白执行“红色条规” 是陆战队员的职责之一吗？
that lets me know that as a Marine one of my duties is to perform Code Reds?

1334
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:30,610
没有，长官，没这种书，长官
No, sir. No book, sir.

1335
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:32,610
我问完了
No further questions.

1336
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:37,240
下士，请你将书翻到…
Corporal, would you turn to the page in this book...

1337
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,700
有餐厅位置说明的那一页
that says where the mess hall is, please?

1338
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,910
凯菲中尉，书里没有这个，长官
Lieutenant Kaffee, that's not in the book, sir.

1339
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:47,380
你是说 你在关达那摩期间从没吃过饭吗？
You mean to say in all your time at Gitmoyou've never had a meal?

1340
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:50,630
不，长官，一日三餐都会吃，长官
No, sir. Three squares a day, sir.

1341
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,970
这我就不懂了
I don't understand.

1342
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:56,180
书里没说，那你怎么知道餐厅在哪？
How did you know where the mess hall was if it's not in this book?

1343
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,930
在吃饭时间跟着大家一起去就能知道
Well, I guess I just followed the crowd at chow time, sir.

1344
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:05,060
我问完了
No more questions.

1345
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:08,860
巴恩斯下士，你可以下去了 谢谢，长官
Corporal Barnes, you may step down. Thank you, sir.

1346
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,910
今晚七点，最后演练一下 对肯德瑞克的问话
7:00 tonight we'll do a final Kendrick review.

1347
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,910
我要让他目瞪口呆
I want to slam-dunk this guy.

1348
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,880
嘿，卢瑟
Hey, Luther.

1349
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,470
“海军上将”，案子的进展如何？
Admiral, how's the big case going?

1350
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:37,510
忙得团团转
Nose to the grindstone.

1351
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:40,760
苍蝇都没法落在你身上 正是这样
No flies on you. A rolling stone gathers no moss.

1352
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,350
鹿死谁手尚未可知
Well, it aingt over till the fat lady sings.

1353
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:45,770
你可以再说一次
You can say that again.

1354
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:49,190
鹿死谁手尚未可知
It aingt over till the fat lady sings. Till the fat lady sings.

1355
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:52,190
说起来轻松
Walked into that one.

1356
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,460
哦，我的天
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1357
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,210
你没锁车门
You left the door unlocked.

1358
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:12,340
你吓得我魂都没了 继续往前开
You scared the shit out of me. Just keep driving.

1359
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:14,340
知道法庭想传讯你吗？
Are you aware you're under subpoena?

1360
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:18,220
知道，我还知道 有两名陆战队员的命运掌握在你手中
Yes. I'm also aware that the lives of two Marines are in your hands.

1361
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:22,930
因为我没能阻止事态的发展 所以只好来帮你一把
If there was something I could do about that, I would. But since I can't, all I can do is help you.

1362
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:25,310
你知道些什么？ 所有细节
What do you know? I know everything.

1363
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:27,600
是一次“红色条规”吗？ 是的
Was it a Code Red? Yes.

1364
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,810
是肯德瑞克下的命令？ 是的
Did Kendrick give the order? Yes.

1365
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:32,820
是你亲眼所见吗？ 用不着
Did you witness it? I didn't need to.

1366
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,530
那你怎么知道？你根本不知道
Then how do you know? You know shit.

1367
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:37,990
他决不会被调离基地
He was never gonna be transferred off that base.

1368
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:47,210
杰赛普想让他留在基地，说要好好教训他
Jessup was gonna keep him on the base. He said he wanted him trained.

1369
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:49,870
可调令是你签发的 我知道
The transfer order has your signature. Yeah, I know.

1370
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:54,000
是圣地亚哥死后第五天 你们到古巴的当天早上签的
I signed it the morning you arrived in Cuba, five days after Santiago died.

1371
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:00,340
我会为你争取举报人豁免权
I'm gonna get you a deal, some kind of immunity with the prosecutor.

1372
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:04,930
四天后你要出面作证 把你知道的事情说出来
In about four days, you'll appear as a witness and tell what you know.

1373
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:08,640
我给你找家旅馆，我们要从头来过
I'm gonna check you into a motel. We are gonna start from the beginning.

1374
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,860
用不着协议，我也不需要豁免权
I don't want a deal, and I don't want immunity.

1375
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:18,280
我只想让你知道 我为自己曾做过和正在做的事而自豪
I want you to know that I'm proud neither of what I've done or am doing.

1376
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:22,450
他在哪？ “东北市区旅馆”
Where is he? The Downtown Lodge in Northeast.

1377
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:24,660
要保证他的安全 是个好提议
I want him guarded. That's a good idea.

1378
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,450
我的安全调查号码是 411527273 安全调查号？
My clearance code is 411527273. Clearance code?

1379
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:30,210
谢谢 你有安全调查号吗？
Thank you. Do you have a clearance code?

1380
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,380
我是乔・盖洛维，我要保护一个证人
This is Jo Galloway. I need to secure a witness.

1381
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,420
总之他说 杰赛普在调离基地一事上撒了谎
Anyway, he also said that Jessup's lying about the transportation off the base.

1382
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:38,300
杰赛普说最早的航班是第二天六点
Jessup said that 6:00 the next morning was the first flight leaving.

1383
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:41,880
马金森说七小时之前就有飞机飞离基地
Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier.

1384
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,970
我记得很清楚，你听到我说的话吗？
That was impressive. Did you hear what I said about the flight?

1385
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:48,310
山姆，飞机何时起飞有记录可查对吗？
Sam, when a flight takes off, there's a record kept, right?

1386
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:50,560
对，得找到基地指挥塔的航行日志
Yeah, you need the tower chiefs log from Gitmo.

1387
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,770
把它找来 我们会赢的
Get it. We're gonna win.

1388
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:56,230
还不知道马金森是否可靠 航行日志还在不在
We don't know who Markinson is. We don't know what the logbook will say.

1389
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,320
你去做多尼的工作，我去向罗斯透露一下
You just concentrate on Downey. I'm gonna tell Ross where we are.

1390
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:09,870
今天询问巴恩斯时表现真不错
Nice work today. Redirect on Barnes.

1391
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:14,080
我找到了马金森 他在哪？
I have Markinson. Where is he?

1392
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,460
“东北”的一个房间 有六个联邦密探守在门口
Motel room in Northeast with six Federal Marshalls outside his door.

1393
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,670
马金森签发的调令是伪造的
The transfer that Markinson signed is phony.

1394
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,590
杰赛普说最早的航班在早上六点是撒谎
Jessup's statement that the 6:00 a.m. Flight was the first available is a lie.

1395
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:26,100
我们在查航空日志，啤酒
We're checking the tower chiefs log. I'd like a beer, please.

1396
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:30,600
同时我要让肯德瑞克出庭 到时就有好戏可看了
In the meantime, I'm gonna put Kendrick on the stand and have some fun.

1397
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,440
好吧，我有义务提醒你…
All right, I have an obligation to tell you...

1398
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,610
如果没有适当的证据 想起诉肯德瑞克或杰赛普…
that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessup of any crime without proper evidence...

1399
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:39,440
你会被军事法庭以渎职罪论处
you'll be subject to a court-martial for professional misconduct.

1400
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,110
会记入你的档案 不管你以后找什么工作都摆脱不了
That's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out.

1401
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:49,290
马金森靠不住，丹尼，他是个疯子
Markinson's not gonna hold up, Danny. He's a crazy man.

1402
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:52,960
我这么说不是想吓你，是为你着想
I'm not saying this to intimidate you. I'm being your lawyer here.

1403
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,130
谢谢，杰克 我觉得你们这帮人都是见鬼的疯子
Thanks, Jack. And I think the fucking bunch of you are certifiably insane.

1404
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:59,550
你们的礼法让我看不顺眼
Your code of honor makes me want to beat the shit out of somebody.

1405
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:03,470
别因为我穿同样的制服 就把我和他们混为一谈
Don't lump me in with them just because we wear the same uniform.

1406
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:06,640
我是你的朋友 也认为你的当事人不该去监狱…
I'm your friend, and I don't think your clients belong in jail...

1407
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,600
但我无权决定
but I don't get to make that decision.

1408
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:13,100
我代表美国政府，不能带感情色彩或偏见
I represent the United States government without passion or prejudice.

1409
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:16,520
我的当事人证据充分 你的酒
My client has a case. Here you go.

1410
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:23,150
你该感谢我作为军事检察官提醒你…
I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware...

1411
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:28,240
没有充分的证据想指控一名 海军陆战队军官犯有重罪会有什么后果
of the possible consequences involved in accusing a Marine officer... of a felony without proper evidence.

1412
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,990
我听过这样的忠告
I've been so advised.

1413
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,000
你是被逼上法庭的，丹尼
You got bullied into that courtroom, Danny.

1414
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,920
所有人都给你压力，有道森，有盖洛维
By everyone. By Dawson, by Galloway.

1415
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,550
见鬼，实际上我也有挑衅你
Shit, I practically dared you.

1416
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,300
你父亲当年的盛名也在逼迫你步入法庭
You got bullied into that courtroom by the memory of a dead lawyer.

1417
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:58,520
你是个下流卑鄙没种的对手，杰克
You're a lousy fucking softball player, Jack!

1418
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:06,110
你的小伙子们完了，丹尼 我再也无能为力了
Your boys are going down, Danny. I can't stop it anymore.

1419
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,700
肯德瑞克上尉，你认为 一等兵圣地亚哥是个好陆战队员吗？
Lieutenant Kendrick, in your opinion, was Private Santiago a good Marine?

1420
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,830
我只能说他很一般
I'd say he was about average.

1421
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,330
你在三份圣地亚哥的考核报告上签过名
You signed three proficiency and conduct reports on Santiago.

1422
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:24,130
你在所有这些报告上 都是给予中等偏下的评语
On all three reports, you indicate a rating of below average.

1423
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:31,390
是的，一等兵圣地亚哥的表现 是低于一般水平
Yes, Private Santiago was below average.

1424
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:35,220
我看不出有必要再践踏一个死者的尊严
I did not see the need to trample on a man's grave.

1425
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,440
我们非常赞同，但你是发过誓的
We appreciate that, but you're under oath now.

1426
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,150
也许会令人不快，但我们是想了解真相
Unpleasant as it may be, we'd all just as soon hear the truth.

1427
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:42,070
我知道我发过誓
I'm aware of my oath.

1428
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:47,110
这是道森准下士最近的三份考核报告 上面有你的签名
These are the last three pro-con reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson.

1429
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:49,110
两次被评为优异…
Dawson received two marks of exceptional...

1430
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:53,580
但最后一份即六月九日 的报告上他得到的评语是中等偏下
but on this most recent report of June 9 he received a rating of below average.

1431
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:57,620
我想讨论一下这最后一份报告 没问题
I'd like to discuss this last report. That would be fine.

1432
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:01,380
道森准下士 从步兵学校毕业后的等级评定非常优秀
Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after the school of infantry was perfect.

1433
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:04,380
同班超过半数的人晋升为下士时…
Over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal...

1434
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,710
道森还是个准下士
while Dawson has remained a lance corporal.

1435
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,800
道森晋升受阻是因为最后这份报告吗？
Was Dawson's promotion held up because of this last report?

1436
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:11,940
肯定是
I'm sure it was.

1437
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:15,030
为什么这份报告 会给道森如此可怜的等级？
Do you recall why Dawson was given such a poor grade on this report?

1438
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,320
我确实忘了
I'm sure I don't.

1439
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,280
我手下有很多人，有很多报告要写
I have many men in my charge. I write many reports.

1440
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:26,120
上尉，你是否能记起一名 叫柯蒂斯・贝尔的一等兵…
Lieutenant, do you recall an incident involving a P.F.C. Curtis Bell...

1441
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,910
从军官俱乐部偷酒的事？
who'd been found stealing liquor from the Officers'Club?

1442
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,870
是的，有这事
Yes, I do.

1443
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,420
你是否向上级举报过？
Did you report Private Bell to proper authorities?

1444
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,460
我床头有两本书…
I have two books at my bedside...

1445
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,550
“海军陆战队员行为守则”和“圣经”
The Marine Corps Code of Conduct and The King james Bible.

1446
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:43,220
我唯一知道的上级就是我的指挥官…
The only proper authorities I'm aware of are my commanding officer...

1447
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,970
内森・Ｒ・杰赛普上校和上帝
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup and the Lord our God.

1448
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:50,100
以你的说法，上尉，我可以理解为…
At your request, Lieutenant Kendrick, I can have the record reflect...

1449
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,850
你不承认军事法庭也是你的上级
your lack of acknowledgement of this court as a proper authority.

1450
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:55,770
反对，与本案无关 反对有效
Objection. Argumentative. Sustained.

1451
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,900
请注意，律师
Watch yourself, counselor.

1452
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,700
你向上级举报柯蒂斯・贝尔没有？
Did you report Private Bell to your superiors?

1453
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,530
我记忆中一等兵贝尔是很优秀的…
I remember thinking very highly of Private Bell...

1454
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:06,790
不希望看到他的履历因此而染上污点
not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal charge.

1455
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:10,830
你更愿意在单位内部解决是吗？
You preferred it be handled within the unit?

1456
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,460
是的，确实如此
Yes, I most certainly did.

1457
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:18,960
你知道什么是“红色条规”吗？ 是的，我知道
Do you know what a Code Red is? Yes, I do.

1458
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,220
你曾下令执行过“红色条规”吗？ 不，我没有
Have you ever ordered a Code Red? No, I have not.

1459
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:25,390
你是否曾命令道森和另两个部下…
Did you order Dawson and two other men to make sure that Private Bell...

1460
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:30,890
看住贝尔，总共七天 除了水之外不给他任何食物或饮料？
received no food or drink, except water, for a period of seven days?

1461
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:33,270
这是歪曲事实，中尉
That is a distortion of the truth, Lieutenant.

1462
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:35,610
一等兵贝尔是被监禁在营房内
Private Bell was placed on barracks restriction.

1463
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,780
有水和维他命作补充 而且我能向你保证…
He was given water and vitamin supplements, and I can assure you...

1464
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,820
他的健康从未受到威胁
at no time was his health in danger.

1465
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,620
我相信这对一等兵贝尔来说很有趣
I'm sure it was lovely for Private Bell.

1466
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,330
但你有没有下令关禁闭呢？
But you did order the barracks restriction, didn't you?

1467
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:52,580
有没有下令不提供食物呢？ 是的，我下过命令
You did order the denial of food? Yes, I did.

1468
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:56,500
这种形式的处罚 可以认为是属于“红色条规”吗？
Wouldn't this form of discipline be considered a Code Red?

1469
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,130
不
No

1470
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:03,130
如果我传关达那摩湾的 其他四百七十八名陆战队员作证…
If I called the other 478 Marines at Guantanamo Bayto testify...

1471
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:05,260
他们会认为这是“红色条规”吗？
would they consider it a Code Red?

1472
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:09,350
证人不可能证实 其他四百七十八个人会怎么说
The witness can't possibly testify as to what 478 other men would say.

1473
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:13,270
控方反对这一系列的提问 这些与本案无关…
We object to this entire line of questioning. It's argumentative...

1474
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:15,690
是对证人的无端骚扰
and irrelevant badgering of the witness.

1475
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:18,400
控方反对有效，凯菲中尉…
The government's objection is sustained, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1476
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,610
我要提醒你 你正在询问的是一名海军军官…
and I would remind you that you're now questioning a Marine officer...

1477
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:23,780
履历记录无可挑剔
with an impeccable service record.

1478
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,410
谢谢，法官大人
Thank you, Your Honor.

1479
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:30,330
上尉，道森最后那份报告 被给予中等偏下的评定…
Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating of below average on this last report...

1480
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:33,250
是因为你发觉他偷偷给贝尔食物吗？
because you learned he'd been sneaking food to Private Bell?

1481
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,630
反对 别着急…上尉？
Object! Not so fast. Lieutenant?

1482
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,960
道森准下士被给予中等偏下的评语…
Lance Corporal Dawson was given a below average rating...

1483
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,380
是因为他违犯了军规
because he had committed a crime.

1484
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:48,720
军规？他犯了什么军规？
A crime? What crime did he commit?

1485
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:51,430
肯德瑞克上尉
Lieutenant Kendrick

1486
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:58,520
道森给一个饥饿的人送食物 犯了哪条军规？
Dawson brought a hungry guy some food. What crime did he commit?

1487
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,900
他违反了命令
He disobeyed an order.

1488
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:04,530
因为他履行了自己的价值观…
And because he exercised his own set ofvalues...

1489
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:07,570
作了与一名陆战队员健康有关的决定…
because he made a decision about the welfare of a Marine...

1490
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:11,290
而这与你的命令有抵触，所以得受罚 是这样吗？
that was in conflict with your order, he was punished, is that right?

1491
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:14,910
道森准下士违反了命令
Lance Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order.

1492
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:17,500
可那不是真正的命令不是吗？
Yeah, but it wasn't a real order, was it?

1493
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,750
毕竟现在是和平年代
After all, it's peacetime.

1494
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:23,090
他没被派去守卫山头或是进攻滩头阵地
He wasn't being asked to secure a hill or advance on a beachhead.

1495
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:27,590
我是说 一名具备道森这种能力的陆战队员…
I mean, surely a Marine of Dawson's intelligence...

1496
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:30,760
完全可以自己决定哪些命令重要…
can be trusted to determine on his own which are the important orders...

1497
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,810
哪些命令有可能…在道德上有疑义
and which orders might, say, be morally questionable?

1498
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,440
肯德瑞克上尉？
Lieutenant Kendrick?

1499
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,770
是这样吗？
Can he?

1500
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:43,530
道森可以自己决定应该服从哪些命令吗？
Can Dawson determine on his own which orders he's going to follow?

1501
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,280
不，他不能
No, he cannot.

1502
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,110
柯蒂斯・贝尔的事让他受了教育，是吧？
A lesson he learned after the Curtis Bell incident, right?

1503
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:51,030
我想是的 你确信是这样对吧？
I would think so. You know so, don't you?

1504
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:52,780
反对 反对有效
Object! Sustained.

1505
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,790
肯德瑞克上尉，最后一个问题
Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question.

1506
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,380
如果你命令道森 对圣地亚哥执行“红色条规”…
If you had ordered Dawson to give Santiago a Code Red...

1507
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:06,670
我特地命令手下… 他会再次违反命令吗？
I specifically ordered those men... Would he disobey you again?

1508
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:10,800
上尉，不必作答 用不着回答，我问完了
Lieutenant, don't answer that! You don't have to. I'm through.

1509
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,510
肯德瑞克上尉 你是否曾命令道森准下士…
Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Lance Corporal Dawson...

1510
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:18,640
和一等兵多尼 对威廉・圣地亚哥执行“红色条规”？
and Private Downey to give Willie Santiago a Code Red?

1511
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,230
肯德瑞克上尉？
Lieutenant Kendrick?

1512
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:24,780
不，我没有 谢谢
No, I did not. Thank you.

1513
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:30,860
怎么样？
What's the word?

1514
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:35,200
我拿到了指挥塔那天晚上的日志 杰赛普说的是事实
I got the tower chiefs log from that night. Jessup's telling the truth.

1515
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:39,580
最早离开的航班是在早上六点 让我看看
6:00 a.m. Flight was the first plane. Let me see this.

1516
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:52,590
今晚加班？ 是啊
Working late tonight? Oh, yeah.

1517
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:00,640
十一点根本没有航班 你到底在搞什么鬼？
There wasn't a flight at 11:00. What the fuck are you trying to pull?

1518
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,940
从关达那摩到美国最早的航班 是在二十三点
The first flight stateside left Guantanamo Bay at 2300.

1519
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:07,940
凌晨两点过几分抵达安德鲁斯空军基地
It arrived at Andrews Air Force Base at a few minutes past 2:00.

1520
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:11,240
是吗？那为什么指挥塔的日志没有记录？
Really? Then why isn't it listed in the tower chiefs log?

1521
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,580
杰赛普
Jessup.

1522
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:17,120
你是说他窜改了日志吗？
What are you telling me? He fixed the logbook?

1523
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,210
也许他能更改起飞记录 但我可以证明曾有飞机降落过
Maybe he can make it so a plane didn't take off, but I can prove one landed.

1524
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:25,340
我去安德鲁斯找记录
I'll get the logbook from Andrews.

1525
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:28,380
你在安德鲁斯的日志上也发现不了什么
You're not gonna find anything in the Andrews logbook, either.

1526
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,380
他能让整个航班消失吗？
He can make an entire flight disappear?

1527
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:34,970
杰赛普就要被任命为安全委员会的主管了
Jessup is about to be appointed director of operations for the Security Council.

1528
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:39,060
不知道怎么避开地雷 是休想得到那个位置的
You don't get to that position without knowing how to sidestep some land mines.

1529
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,980
可他没法避开你
He's not gonna be able to sidestep you.

1530
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:44,440
你不会还想让我出庭吧？
You don't still intend to put me on the stand?

1531
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:47,480
星期四上午十点
Thursday morning, 10:00.

1532
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:55,740
得找到能证实有那趟航班的人
There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight.

1533
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:59,040
这不象航空公司有固定的飞行时刻表
This isn't TWA. There isn't a regular flight schedule.

1534
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,910
你知道每天有多少架飞机起起落落？
Do you have any idea how many planes take off and land every day?

1535
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:05,420
地勤人员也记不住 那趟航班四周前的降落时间
A ground crew kid won't remember a flight that landed four weeks ago.

1536
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:08,630
不去查怎么会知道呢？ 忘了那趟航班
How do you know if you don't check? Forget the flight!

1537
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:12,510
马金森会证明杰赛普拒绝调走圣地亚哥
Markinson will testify that Jessup refused to transfer Santiago.

1538
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:15,140
他会证明调令是伪造的，这就够了
He'll testify to the forged transfer, and that'll be enough.

1539
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,760
加上多尼的证词应该够了
That and Downey's testimony really ought to be enough.

1540
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:27,230
六号夜里你们为什么 进入圣地亚哥的房间？
Why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th?

1541
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:30,530
对一等兵圣地亚哥 执行“红色条规”，夫人
To give Private Santiago a Code Red, ma'am.

1542
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:32,780
你们为什么这样做？
Why did you give him a Code Red?

1543
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:37,180
是Ｗ步兵警卫连 排长乔纳森-詹姆斯-肯德瑞克上尉…
I was ordered to give him a Code Red by the platoon commander...

1544
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:40,660
下令对他执行“红色条规”
of Rifle Security Company Windward, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1545
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:44,210
你们会没事的
You're gonna do fine.

1546
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,340
你觉得会让我们很快回连队吗，夫人？
You think they'll let us go back to our platoon soon, ma'am?

1547
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:51,630
绝对没问题
Absolutely.

1548
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,300
记得提问的顺序吗？能肯定吗？
Do you remember the order of questions? Areyou sure?

1549
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,310
简练一点，不然他听不懂就麻烦了
And we'll use small words,'cause he gets rattled ifhe doesn't understand.

1550
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:03,270
我是说节奏要慢一点 我会的
I'm just saying go slow. I'm gonna go slow.

1551
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,270
但要尽快把问题问完
And get him off as fast as you can.

1552
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:09,270
怎么了？不会有问题的
What? It's gonna be fine.

1553
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:13,650
尊敬的圣地亚哥先生和夫人…
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Santiago...

1554
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:17,490
我是威廉的行政长官
I was William's executive officer.

1555
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:21,080
我对令郎不太熟悉，只知道他叫什么名字
I knew your son vaguely, which is to say I knew his name.

1556
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:26,870
那两个对令郎之死负有责任的人 的审判很快就有结果了
In a matter of time, the trial of the two men... charged with your son's death will be concluded...

1557
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:29,210
你们素不相识的七男两女…
and seven men and two women whom you've never met...

1558
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:33,300
将试着为令郎的死给出一个解释
will try to offer you an explanation as to why William is dead.

1559
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:37,050
而我已经尽我所能来使真相大白于天下
For my part, I've done as much as I can to bring the truth to light.

1560
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,340
事实上…
And the truth is this...

1561
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,010
令郎的死只有一个原因…
Your son is dead for only one reason...

1562
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,020
我阻止事态发展时不够强硬
I wasn't strong enough to stop it.

1563
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:51,020
美国海军，马修-安德鲁-马金森中校 敬上
Always, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Andrew Markinson... United States Marine Corps.

1564
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:59,740
一等兵，我要你再向大家说一次
Private, I want you to tell us one last time.

1565
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:05,660
你们为什么在九月六日夜里 去一等兵圣地亚哥的房间？
Why did you go to Private Santiago's room on the night of September 6?

1566
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:10,540
是排长肯德瑞克上尉 命令我们去执行“红色条规”
A Code Red was ordered by my platoon commander... Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1567
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,840
谢谢
Thank you.

1568
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,500
该你问了
Your witness.

1569
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:21,260
一等兵，九月二日那一周的…
Private, the week of 2 September...

1570
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:24,850
换岗记录显示 十六点以前你一直在三十九号哨岗
the switch log has you down at Post 39 until 1600.

1571
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:26,060
是这样吗？
Is that correct?

1572
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,100
是的，长官，记录一直做得很准确
I'm sure it is, sir. They keep that log pretty good.

1573
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:32,770
三十九号哨岗离Ｗ连的营房有多远？
How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward Barracks?

1574
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:36,320
有点距离，长官，得走一阵子
Well, it's a ways, sir. It's a hike.

1575
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,240
搭乘越野车要多久？
About how far by Jeep?

1576
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:42,660
他问这个干什么？ 十到十五分钟，长官
About ten or fifteen minutes, sir.

1577
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:44,620
你曾步行过吗？
You ever had to walk it?

1578
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:48,540
是的，长官 星期五那天，“临时司机”…
Yes, sir. That day, Friday. The pickup private...

1579
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:51,670
我们都这么叫负责接送我们的二等兵…
That's what we call the guy who drops us off and picks us up...

1580
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,960
同时也因为他能在“纽约城”泡到女孩子
also'cause he can get girls in New York City.

1581
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,130
他到三十九号哨的时候爆胎了
The pickup private got a flat, sir, right at 39.

1582
01:40:58,130 --> 01:41:01,050
他一停车，胎就爆了，又没有备胎
He pulled up and, bam, blowout with no spare.

1583
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:03,140
所以我们只好跑步回营房
So we had to double-time it back to the barracks.

1584
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:06,930
既然越野车要花十到十五分钟，我猜…
And if it's about ten or fifteen minutes by Jeep, I'm guessing...

1585
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:10,100
跑步至少要一个小时，对不对？
it must be a good hour by foot, am I right?

1586
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:13,270
他和我刚好用了四十五分钟，长官
Pickup and me did it in 45 flat, sir.

1587
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,730
不错啊
Not bad.

1588
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:19,610
你说你们去袭击一等兵圣地亚哥…
You've said that your assault on Private Santiago...

1589
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:22,950
是因为肯德瑞克上尉十六点二十分时…
was a result of an order that Lieutenant Kendrick gave you...

1590
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:26,660
在你们的房间给你们下了命令，对不对？
in your barracks room at 1620, am I right?

1591
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:29,290
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1592
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:33,250
但你刚才说十六点四十五分之前 你们还没回到营房
But you just said that you didn't make it back to the barracks until 1645.

1593
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:39,920
既然十六点四十五分之前 你还没回到营房…
Well, if you didn't make it back to the barracks until 1645...

1594
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,180
那十六点二十分你怎么会在房间里？
how could you be in your room at 1620?

1595
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:46,010
是这样，长官，车胎爆了…
Well, you see, sir, there was a blowout...

1596
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:49,980
你有没有亲耳听到 肯德瑞克上尉下令执行“红色条规”？
Did you ever actually hear Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1597
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,770
哈罗德说…
Well, Hal said that...

1598
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:54,400
一等兵，你有没有亲耳听到…
Private, did you ever actually hear...

1599
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,780
肯德瑞克上尉下令执行“红色条规”？ 没有，长官
Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1600
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:02,320
请求暂时休庭 我要和我的当事人交换意见
I'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client.

1601
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,700
你为什么去圣地亚哥的房间？ 证人有他的权利
Why did you go into Santiago's room? The witness has rights!

1602
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:08,040
证人早就知道他的权利 重复一下刚才的问题
The witness has been read his rights. The question will be repeated.

1603
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,040
你为什么去圣地亚哥的房间？ 哈罗德
Why did you go into Santiago's room?

1604
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:13,540
是道森要你去执行“红色条规”吗？ 哈罗德
Did Lance Corporal Dawson tell you to give Santiago a Code Red?

1605
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,330
不要看他 哈罗德
Don't look at him! Hal!

1606
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,380
回答上尉的问题
Answer the captaings question!

1607
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:26,430
长官，是我的班长，美国海军 哈罗德-Ｗ-道森准下士给我的命令…
Yes, Captain, I was given an order by my squad leader... Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson, United States Marine Corps...

1608
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:27,720
所以我执行了
and I followed it.

1609
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,830
你说他会去哪？
Where do you think he is?

1610
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,870
对多尼而言，那就是肯德瑞克下的命令
As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order from Kendrick.

1611
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,920
是不是亲耳听到都一样
It doesn't matter that he didn't hear it firsthand.

1612
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,090
他不会关心两者之间的区别
He doesn't distinguish between the two.

1613
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,510
丹尼，我很抱歉
Danny, I'm sorry.

1614
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:09,970
不用担心
Don't worry about it.

1615
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:12,640
山姆和我刚才谈到我们应该…
Sam and I were just talking about how all we really have to do...

1616
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,560
找些能指认间接命令的证人
is call some witnesses who will talk about implied orders.

1617
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,230
在盘问道森之前让多尼再次充当证人
Maybe we can put Downey back on the stand before we get to Dawson.

1618
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:23,690
照这样干下去 我们能让道森为暗杀肯尼迪负责
If we work at it, we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination.

1619
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:28,030
你喝了酒？
Are you drunk?

1620
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:31,740
喝了不少
Pretty much.

1621
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:37,790
我去多弄点咖啡 我们今天要忙到很晚才行
I'll put on a pot of coffee. We've got a long night's work ahead.

1622
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:41,300
她要去弄咖啡
She's gonna make coffee.

1623
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,380
真不赖
That's nice.

1624
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:51,180
多尼当时不在房间里
Downey wasn't in his room.

1625
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,140
根本不在
Wasn't even there.

1626
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,810
那是条非常重要的信息，你认为呢？
That was an important piece of information, don't you think?

1627
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:04,570
丹尼，这是个打击，对此我很抱歉
Danny, it was a setback, and I'm sorry.

1628
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:07,320
但还能补救，我们有马金森
But we fix it, and move on to Markinson.

1629
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,780
马金森死了
Markinson's dead.

1630
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:20,710
你真得感谢那些联邦密探，伙计
You really gotta hand it to those Federal Marshals, boy.

1631
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:23,460
他不是用自己的鞋带上吊…
It's not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces...

1632
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:26,130
也不是用偷藏的黄油刀割腕
or slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife.

1633
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:27,590
这家伙…
This guy...

1634
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:33,260
身着全套制服，站在房间的中央…
got into full dress uniform, stood in the middle of that room...

1635
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:36,480
从他的枪套里拔出一支蹭亮的手枪…
drew a nickel-plated pistol from his holster...

1636
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,980
朝自己的嘴里开了一枪
and fired a bullet into his mouth.

1637
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:46,740
既然我们已经没有证人了 我想我该喝上一点
Anyway, since we seem to be out of witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little.

1638
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:48,990
我还是认为我们能赢
I still think we can win.

1639
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:52,620
或许你也该喝点
Maybe you should drink a little.

1640
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:57,750
我们明早去找伦道夫法官 要求押后二十四小时再审
We'll go to Randolph in the morning and make a motion for a 24-hour continuance.

1641
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:01,120
我们这样做是为什么？ 传讯杰赛普上校
Why would we want to do that? To subpoena Colonel Jessup.

1642
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:05,000
什么？ 别急，听我说完
What? Listen for a second. Hear me out.

1643
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,090
我不想听，更不想听你说完
I won't listen, and I won't hear you out.

1644
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:09,470
勇气可嘉，但毫无意义
Your passion is compelling, Jo. It's also useless.

1645
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:12,720
劳登・多尼今天需要一个庭审律师
Louden Downey needed a trial lawyer today.

1646
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:17,350
胆小鬼
You're chickenshit.

1647
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:20,230
你想用今天的事作借口认输吗？
You're gonna use what happened today as an excuse to give up.

1648
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,230
结束了
It's over.

1649
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:25,900
你干嘛要向杰赛普要那份调令？
Why did you ask Jessup for the transfer order?

1650
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:28,610
为什么？ 这有什么？
In Cuba. Why? What does it matter?

1651
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:31,360
我想要那份该死的调令 胡说
I wanted the damn transfer order! Bullshit.

1652
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,910
想要的话在五角大楼任何部门都能找到
You could've gotten it by calling any department at the Pentagon.

1653
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:39,710
你不是想要那份调令 你是想看看杰赛普的反应
You didn't want the transfer order. You wanted to see Jessup's reaction.

1654
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:42,880
直觉告诉你有内情 而马金森证实了这一点
You had an instinct, and it was confirmed by Markinson.

1655
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,880
我们要让杰赛普出庭了结此事
Let's put Jessup on the stand and end this thing!

1656
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:50,090
让杰赛普出庭又能有什么好结果呢？
What possible good could come from putting Jessup on the stand?

1657
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,300
是他让肯德瑞克下的“红色条规”令
He told Kendrick to order the Code Red.

1658
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:56,430
是吗？那太好了，你凭什么这么说？
He did? That's great! Why didn't you say so?

1659
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:58,770
显然你能证明这一点
And of course you have proof of that!

1660
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:03,060
对不起，我忘了 你因病缺席了法律学校的法律课
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You were sick the day they taught law at law school.

1661
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,610
让他出庭作证，让他自己说出来
You put him on the stand, and you get it from him.

1662
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:09,740
让他自己说出来，是啊，没问题
Oh, we get it from him! Yes! No problem!

1663
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:13,610
杰赛普上校，是不是你 下令对圣地亚哥执行“红色条规”？
Colonel Jessup, isn't it true that you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

1664
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:16,830
听着，我们都有点… 对不起，时间到
Listen, we're all a little... I'm sorry. Your time's run out.

1665
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:20,000
该怎么打发输家呢？让我们的被告…
What do we have for the losers? Well, for our defendants...

1666
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,410
在莱文沃斯堡（监狱）休养一辈子
it's a lifetime at exotic Fort Leavenworth.

1667
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:25,460
至于辩护律师凯菲中尉…
And for Defense Counsel Kaffee...

1668
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,290
让他上军事法庭
it's a court-martial!

1669
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,590
没错，伙计，因为共谋及作伪证…
Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing...

1670
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:34,890
无端指控一名功勋卓著的海军军官…
a highly decorated Marine officer... of conspiracy and perjury...

1671
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:38,100
凯菲中尉会有一份美好的前途…
Lieutenant Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career...

1672
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:43,440
去沃克科洛布女子学校 执教打字机维修
teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocco Clubo School for Women.

1673
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:49,690
谢谢你参与 “我们该不该听从笨蛋的劝告？”的演出
Thank you for playing "Should we or should we not... follow the advice of the galactically stupid?"

1674
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:14,630
很抱歉我毁了你的大好前程
I'm sorry I lost your set of steak knives.

1675
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:33,530
别收拾了
Stop cleaning up.

1676
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,660
山姆，别收拾了
Stop cleaning up.

1677
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:52,130
想喝点吗？
Want a drink? Yeah.

1678
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:13,360
你父亲以你为荣吗？ 别给自己太多压力
Is your father proud of you? Don't do this to yourself.

1679
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,150
我敢说一定是
I'll bet he is.

1680
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:19,320
我打赌他会不厌其烦地对邻居和亲戚说…
I'll bet he bores the shit out of the neighbors and relatives.

1681
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,870
山姆上了'法律评论'栏目 他接了个大案子
"Sam's made LawReview. He's got a big case he's making.

1682
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:27,080
他上庭了，正在为一个案子作辩护律师
He's arguing. He's making an argument."

1683
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:36,880
我父亲一定很高兴看到我从法律学校毕业
I think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school.

1684
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:43,010
他一定为此欣喜若狂
I think he would've liked that an awful lot.

1685
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:51,020
我有没有告诉过你 我在学校时写过一篇关于你父亲的论文？
Did I ever tell you I wrote a paper about your father in college? Yeah?

1686
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:53,730
他是有史以来最好的律师之一
One of the best trial lawyers ever.

1687
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:57,110
是的，的确是
Yes, he was.

1688
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:59,490
如果我是道森和多尼…
If I were Dawson and Downey and I had a choice...

1689
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:02,530
要从你和你父亲当中选代表律师的话…
between you or your father to represent me in this case...

1690
01:49:02,530 --> 01:49:05,580
不管什么时候我都会选你
I'd choose you any day of the week and twice on Sunday.

1691
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:09,120
要知道你把肯德瑞克给镇住了
You should've seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick.

1692
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,090
你会让杰赛普出庭吗？
Would you put Jessup on the stand?

1693
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:16,170
不会
No

1694
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,300
你觉得我父亲会这样做吗？ 以我们掌握的证据而言吗？
Do you think my father would have? With the evidence we got?

1695
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:25,260
绝对不会
Not in a million years.

1696
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:28,730
但问题是…现在所有的人都知道…
But here's the thing... and there's really know way of getting around this...

1697
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:33,110
既不是你父亲也不是我 在担任首席辩护律师来处理…
Neither Lyle Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel for the defense...

1698
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:36,320
这起政府起诉道森和多尼的案子
in the matter of U... S. V. Dawson and Downey.

1699
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:40,400
所以唯一的问题就是…你会怎么做？
So there's really only one question... What would you do?

1700
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:56,460
乔，上车，乔安妮，求你上车吧
Jo, get in the car. Joanne, please get in the car.

1701
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:57,920
听我说…
Look...

1702
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:05,760
我很抱歉冲你发火，我为我说的话道歉
I apologize. I was angry. I'm sorry about what I said.

1703
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,430
我会让杰赛普出庭作证
I'm gonna put Jessup on the stand.

1704
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:30,330
你觉得我们该怎么做？
What do you suggest we do?

1705
01:50:30,330 --> 01:50:32,580
证明杰赛普伪造了调令
I say we hit Jessup with the phony transfer order.

1706
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,580
上哪去找证人？
What's a transfer order without a witness?

1707
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:36,250
我们有证人 已经死了
We have a witness. A dead witness.

1708
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:39,250
对一个次席律师来说这确实是个问题
In the hands of a lesser attorney, that would be a problem.

1709
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:41,800
瞧瞧吧，昨晚他还在借酒消愁…
Look at this. Last night he's swimming in Jack Daniels...

1710
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:44,590
现在却无所不能了
and now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound.

1711
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:47,850
我又上好发条了，你们都坐好
I'm getting my second wind. Sit down, both of you.

1712
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:52,480
很好，杰赛普让肯德瑞克 下“红色条规”令，肯德瑞克照做了
Good. Jessup told Kendrick to order the Code Red. Kendrick did.

1713
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,770
当事人执行了命令，这我们无法证实
Our clients followed the order. The cover-up isn't our case.

1714
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:59,480
要赢的话，得让杰赛普 告诉陪审团是他下的“红色条规”令
To win, Jessup needs to tell the court members that he ordered the Code Red.

1715
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:03,280
你觉得你能让他说出来吗？ 我觉得他想说出来
You think you can get him to say it? I think he wants to say it.

1716
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,610
他肯定因为不能说出来而恼火
I think he's pissed off that he's got to hide from us.

1717
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:09,200
他想说出是他作的决定 这样事情就能解决
I think he wants to say that he made a command decision, and that's the end.

1718
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,200
他吃早餐时三百码外…
He eats breakfast 300 yards away...

1719
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:15,540
有四千名训练有素的古巴人想干掉他
from 4,000 Cubans that are trained to kill him.

1720
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,670
没人能干涉他带兵的方式
No one's gonna tell him how to run his unit.

1721
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:20,630
至少穿着娘娘腔制服的“哈佛嘴”不能
Least of all the Harvard mouth in his faggotywhite uniform.

1722
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:22,800
我得激怒他，让他进行反击…
I need to shake him, put him on the defensive...

1723
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:25,590
然后领着他自掘坟墓
and lead him right where he's dying to go.

1724
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:28,640
就这样？这就是计划？ 这就是计划
That's it? That's the plan? That's the plan.

1725
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:31,890
你打算怎么做？ 还没头绪
How are you gonna do it? I have no idea.

1726
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:34,100
我需要我的球棒 需要什么？
I need my bat. Your what?

1727
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:36,440
拿着球棒我的思路更敏捷，它在哪？
I think better with my bat. Where's my bat?

1728
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,980
我把它放在壁橱里了 你把它放在壁橱里了？
I put it in the closet. You put it in the closet?

1729
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:43,940
我被它绊了一下 永远别把它放到壁橱里
I was tripping on it. Don't ever put that bat in the closet.

1730
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:47,870
拿着球棒能让他思路更敏捷？ 我能理解
He thinks better with his bat? I can understand that.

1731
01:51:59,210 --> 01:52:02,210
呆在这，我去趟办公室
Stay here. I'm going to the office for a while.

1732
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:07,340
拿着球棒确实能给他灵感
He does think better with that bat.

1733
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,560
古巴关达那摩湾 打出电话记录

1734
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:33,200
山姆，我要你替我办件事
Sam, I need you to do something for me.

1735
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:39,630
怎么了？ 得去趟安德鲁斯
What's going on? Gotta go out to Andrews.

1736
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,400
山姆呢？ 还在路上
Where's Sam? He's on his way.

1737
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,400
他找到人没有？ 找到了
Did he get the guys? Yeah.

1738
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:10,490
能和你聊几句吗？
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?

1739
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,780
当然，没问题
Oh, yeah, sure.

1740
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:24,840
你感觉怎么样？
How you feeling?

1741
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:29,880
我看杰赛普今天要举手投降了
Well, I think Jessup's gonna have his hands full today.

1742
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:34,510
听我说，丹尼…
Listen, Danny...

1743
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,140
你今天上去的时候…
when you're out there today...

1744
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:41,350
如果感觉计划不能成功…
if you feel like it's not gonna happen...

1745
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:44,570
如果你觉得他不会说出来…
if you feel like he's not gonna say it...

1746
01:53:44,570 --> 01:53:46,190
就别勉强行事
don't go for it.

1747
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:49,990
不然你会惹上麻烦
You could get in trouble.

1748
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:52,110
我是内政部的特别律师…
I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs...

1749
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,780
我知道那会惹来多少麻烦
and I'm telling you you could get in a lot of trouble.

1750
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:56,830
等等，盖洛维少校…
Wait, Lieutenant Commander Galloway...

1751
01:53:56,870 --> 01:54:01,160
你不是在奉劝我放弃这个重要证人吧？
you're not suggesting that I back off a material witness?

1752
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:04,460
如果你觉得不能引他上钩的话，是的
If you think you can't get him, yeah.

1753
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:08,300
全体起立
All rise.

1754
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:16,180
山姆呢？ 就快到了
Where's Sam? He's on his way.

1755
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:24,400
传第一位证人 他在哪？
Call your first witness. Where is he?

1756
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,770
他会来的 中尉
He'll be here. Lieutenant.

1757
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:28,480
传你的证人
Call your witness.

1758
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:37,870
辩方传唤内森・杰赛普上校
Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessup.

1759
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:57,470
杰赛普上校，请举起你的右手，长官
Colonel Jessup, would you raise your right hand please, sir?

1760
01:54:57,470 --> 01:55:01,020
你能发誓你在法庭上所说的一切…
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this court-martial...

1761
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:04,520
完全属实，绝无虚假吗？
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1762
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,940
我发誓
Yes, I do.

1763
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:07,480
请坐下，长官
Have a seat please, sir.

1764
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:12,610
请说出你的姓名，军衔和现任职务 以便法庭记录
Would you state your name, rank and current billet for the record, sir?

1765
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:15,820
内森・Ｒ・杰赛普，上校…
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup, commanding officer...

1766
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:19,200
古巴关达那摩湾 美国海军陆战队指挥官
Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1767
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:21,580
谢谢，长官 他还没来
Thank you, sir. He's not here.

1768
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:30,960
上校，你得知圣地亚哥 写给海军调查处的那封信时…
Colonel, when you learned of Santiago's letter to the N.I. S...

1769
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,170
曾和你手下两位高级军官开过会
you had a meeting with your two senior officers.

1770
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:36,300
是这样吗？ 是的
Is that right? Yes.

1771
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:39,970
是排长乔纳森・肯德瑞克上尉…
The platoon commander, Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

1772
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:43,730
和行政长官马修・马金森中校吗？
and the executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

1773
01:55:43,730 --> 01:55:45,270
是的
Yes.

1774
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:49,900
现在马金森中校已经死了，是这样吗？
And at present Colonel Markinson is dead. Is that right?

1775
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:54,030
反对，不知辩方律师这是什么意思
Objection. I'd like to know just what the defense counsel is implying.

1776
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:57,530
意思很简单，就是马金森中校已经死了
I'm implying simply that at present Colonel Markinson is not alive.

1777
01:55:57,530 --> 01:56:01,330
杰赛普上校 用不着在法庭上确认这个消息
Colonel Jessup doesn't need to appear in court to confirm that information.

1778
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:06,710
我是想确认证人是否知道两天前 中校用一支点四五手枪自尽了
I just wasn't sure the witness was aware that two days ago... the colonel took his own life with a.45-caliber pistol.

1779
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:09,250
证人知道了，法庭知道了…
The witness is aware, the court is aware...

1780
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:11,250
现在陪审团也知道了
and now the court members are aware.

1781
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:14,880
谢谢你为我们带来这个消息
We thank you for bringing this to our attention.

1782
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,680
继续吧，中尉
Move on, Lieutenant...

1783
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:18,510
好的，法官大人
Yes, sir.

1784
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:22,220
上校，你在会上 给肯德瑞克上尉下过命令是吗？
Colonel, you gave Lieutenant Kendrick an order at this meeting, right?

1785
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:26,640
我让肯德瑞克告诉他的手下 不许碰圣地亚哥
I told Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1786
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:29,650
你是不是也给马金森中校下过命令？
And did you give an order to Colonel Markinson as well?

1787
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:35,240
我命令马金森立刻将圣地亚哥调离基地
I ordered Markinson to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately.

1788
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,070
为什么？
Why?

1789
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:40,950
我担心一旦信的内容泄露出去 他可能会有生命危险
I felt his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out.

1790
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:42,410
致命的危险？
Grave danger?

1791
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:44,700
还能是什么？
Is there another kind?

1792
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:52,250
上校，这是你和马金森联合签名的调令…
Colonel, we have the transfer order that you and Markinson co-signed...

1793
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:56,970
命令圣地亚哥乘第二天凌晨六点的航班 离开关达那摩
ordering that Santiago be on a flight leaving Guantanamo at 6:00 the next day.

1794
01:56:56,970 --> 01:57:02,260
那是最早的航班吗？ 六点是最早飞离基地的航班
Was that the first flight? The 0600 was the first flight.

1795
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:09,390
你是今早乘飞机来华盛顿的对吗？
You flew up to Washington this morning. Is that right?

1796
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:12,860
我注意到你今天是穿着高级制服上的法庭
I notice you'rewearing your class "A" dress uniform in court today.

1797
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:16,110
彼此彼此，中尉 你在飞机上也是这身穿着吗？
As are you, Lieutenant. Did you wear that on the plane?

1798
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:18,990
法官大人，这与本案有什么关…
Please the court, is this dialogue relevant to anything...

1799
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:21,740
辩方难得有机会请这位证人作证
Defense didn't have the opportunity to depose this witness.

1800
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:25,580
我想多问几个问题 请注意提问范围
I'd ask for a little latitude. A very little latitude.

1801
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,160
上校？
Colonel?

1802
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,790
我在飞机上穿的是便服
I wore utilities on the plane.

1803
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:32,920
不过你带着军装是吧？ 是的
You brought your dress uniform? Yes.

1804
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:36,420
那么牙刷，剃须刀，内衣呢？ 法官大人…
Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear? Your Honor!

1805
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,840
难道上校的内衣也是国家机密吗？
Is the colonel's underwear a matter of national security?

1806
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:42,300
两位，你最好尽快问完这些，中尉
Gentlemen! You better get somewhere fast with this, Lieutenant.

1807
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:44,430
是，大人，上校？
Yes, sir. Colonel?

1808
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:49,270
我带了一套替换衣服和一些私人用品
I brought a change of clothes and some personal items.

1809
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:51,190
谢谢
Thank you.

1810
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:54,940
道森和多尼在六号晚上被拘捕后…
After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the sixth...

1811
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:59,280
圣地亚哥的房间就被封了 这是房内的物品清单
Santiago's barracks were sealed off and its contents inventoried.

1812
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:02,660
四条迷彩裤，三件卡其衬衣…
"Four pairs camouflage pants, three long-sleeve khaki shirts...

1813
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:06,620
三双靴子，四双军袜，三件军用Ｔ恤…
three pairs of boots, four pairs green socks, three green T-shirts..."

1814
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,620
法官大人，我们要一直这么问下去吗？
Please the court, is there a question anywhere in our future?

1815
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:12,830
凯菲中尉，我得要求你提出你的问题
Lieutenant Kaffee, I have to ask you to state your question.

1816
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:15,710
为什么圣地亚哥没有收拾行李？
I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed.

1817
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:21,090
我稍后会告诉大家，先来看看这个
I'll tell you what. We'll get back to that one in a minute.

1818
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:25,300
这是过去二十四小时 从你们基地打出的所有电话记录
This is a record of all phone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours.

1819
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:28,970
在被传唤来华盛顿之后，你打过三个电话
After being subpoenaed to Washington, you made three calls.

1820
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:31,350
你熟悉这些号码吗？
Do you recognize those number, sir?

1821
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:34,560
一个打给维州匡迪科基地的菲茨上校
I called Colonel Fitzhughes in Quantico, Virginia.

1822
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,440
让他知道我要来这
I wanted to let him know that I would be in town.

1823
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,070
第二个是打给众议院军事委员会 的里奇蒙德议员…
The second call was to arrange a meeting with Congressman Richmond...

1824
01:58:41,070 --> 01:58:43,410
和他商量见一下面
of the House Armed Services Committee.

1825
01:58:43,410 --> 01:58:46,530
第三个是打给我妹妹伊莉莎白
And the third call was to my sister Elizabeth.

1826
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:48,700
为什么要打这个电话，长官？
Why did you make that call, sir?

1827
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:52,160
我想请她今晚一起吃晚饭
I thought she might like to have dinner tonight.

1828
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:55,630
我会制止的 这些是九月六日从关达那摩…
I'm gonna stop this. These are phone records from Gitmo...

1829
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:59,920
打出的电话记录，而这是圣地亚哥…
for September 6, and these are 14 letters...

1830
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,720
在九个月内写的十四封信…
that Santiago wrote in nine months...

1831
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:05,970
请求…事实上是乞求…调离
requesting... in fact, begging... for a transfer.

1832
01:59:05,970 --> 01:59:09,220
在得知终于被允许调离的消息之后…
Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer...

1833
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:13,270
圣地亚哥非常兴奋 知道他给多少人打过电话吗？
Santiago was so excited that do you know how many people he called?

1834
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:15,810
没给任何人打过
Zero. Nobody.

1835
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:19,730
没有一个电话告知他的父母他要回家了
Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home.

1836
01:59:19,730 --> 01:59:23,030
没有一个电话打给朋友说 “你能来机场接我吗”
Not one call to a friend, saying, "Can you pick me up at the airport?"

1837
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:26,950
半夜时他在床上睡着了，依你所说…
He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you...

1838
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:29,540
他六小时后就要上飞机
he was getting on a plane in six hours.

1839
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:33,210
可他所有的东西 还整整齐齐地放在壁橱里…
Yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet...

1840
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:35,870
整整齐齐地叠放在扁条箱里
and folded neatly in his footlocker.

1841
01:59:35,870 --> 01:59:39,710
你只离开一天 就收拾了行李并打了三个电话
You were leaving for one day. You packed a bag and made three calls.

1842
01:59:39,710 --> 01:59:44,220
而圣地亚哥离开后这辈子都不会再回来…
Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life...

1843
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,680
但他没打一个电话…
and he hadn't called a soul...

1844
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:51,430
没收拾一件物品
and he hadn't packed a thing.

1845
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,400
这你能解释吗？
Can you explain that?

1846
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:01,190
事实是根本没有调令
The fact is, there was no transfer order.

1847
02:00:01,190 --> 02:00:04,030
圣地亚哥哪都不会去，是不是，上校？
Santiago wasn't going anywhere. Isn't that right, Colonel?

1848
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:07,570
反对，法官大人，显然凯菲中尉意图…
Objection. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lieutenant Kaffee's intention...

1849
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:09,950
诽谤一位高级海军军官…
is the smear a high-ranking Marine officer...

1850
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:13,700
希望以这种无礼的举动来达到他的目的
in the hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points.

1851
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:17,710
大人，我请求对凯菲中尉予以惩戒…
It's my recommendation, sir, that Lieutenant Kaffee be reprimanded...

1852
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:20,670
以此向证人表示法庭最诚恳的歉意
and the witness be excused with the court's deepest apologies.

1853
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:25,630
驳回请求… 你的反对已记入笔录
Overruled. Your objection is noted.

1854
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:27,720
上校？
Colonel?

1855
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,850
很可笑吗，长官？
Is this funny, sir?

1856
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:37,270
不，不是可笑，是可悲
No, it's not. It's tragic.

1857
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:40,060
可以回答吗？ 当然
Do you have an answer? Absolutely.

1858
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:43,940
我得说，我没有这见鬼的第一线索
My answer is, I don't have the first damn clue.

1859
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:47,780
也许他习惯早起，愿意在早上收拾行李
Maybe he was an early riser and liked to pack in the morning.

1860
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:50,660
也许他根本没什么朋友
And maybe he didn't have any friends.

1861
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:54,240
我是受过教育，但我恐怕答不出…
I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently...

1862
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:57,960
关于威廉・圣地亚哥出行习惯的智力题
about the travel habits of William Santiago.

1863
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:03,170
我只知道他已经被安排在六点离开基地
What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600.

1864
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:09,050
现在，难道叫我到这来 就是为了回答这些问题吗？
Now, are these really the questions that I was called here to answer?

1865
02:01:09,050 --> 02:01:11,470
电话以及扁条箱？
Phone calls and footlockers?

1866
02:01:11,470 --> 02:01:15,270
请告诉我你还想知道些什么，中尉
Please tell me that you have something more, Lieutenant.

1867
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:19,100
这次审判将决定两名陆战队员的命运
These two Marines are on trial for their lives.

1868
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:23,690
请告诉我他们的律师 不会将希望寄托在电话清单上
Please tell me that their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.

1869
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:29,570
你还有其他问题要问吗，律师？
Do you have any other questions for me, counselor?

1870
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,160
凯菲中尉？
Lieutenant Kaffee?

1871
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:51,890
中尉，你还有什么问题要问证人吗？
Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness?

1872
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:01,600
谢谢，丹尼，我喜欢华盛顿
Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.

1873
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,270
抱歉，我还没让你走呢
Excuse me. I didn't dismiss you.

1874
02:02:05,270 --> 02:02:07,070
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

1875
02:02:07,110 --> 02:02:11,780
我的盘问还没有结束，坐下
I'm not through with my examination. Sit down.

1876
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:16,200
上校 什么意思？
Colonel. What's that?

1877
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,910
你该称呼我 “上校” 或 “长官”
I'd appreciate it if you'd address me as "colonel" or "sir."

1878
02:02:18,910 --> 02:02:20,540
这是我应得的尊重
I believe I've earned it.

1879
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:24,880
辩方律师应该称呼证人 “上校” 或 “长官”
Defense counsel will address the witness as "colonel" or "sir."

1880
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,920
我不知道你管理的是什么鬼单位
I don't know what the hell kind of unit you're running here.

1881
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,800
证人应该称呼法官 “法官大人” 或者 “庭上”
The witness will address this court as "judge" or "your honor."

1882
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:36,720
我很肯定这是我应得的尊重 请坐，上校
I'm quite certain I've earned it. Take your seat, Colonel.

1883
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,730
你现在想讨论什么？我最喜欢的颜色吗？
What do you want to discuss now? My favorite color?

1884
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:49,650
上校，最早离开基地的航班是在六点吗？
Colonel, the 6:00 a.m. Flight was the first one off the base?

1885
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:50,740
是的
Yes.

1886
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:52,910
没有航班在七小时前离开…
There wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier...

1887
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:55,320
并于凌晨两点降落在安德鲁斯吗？
and landed at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 a. M?

1888
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:58,370
中尉，我们不是问过这个问题了吗？
Lieutenant, I think we've covered this, haven't we?

1889
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:01,500
法官大人，这些是…
Your Honor, these are the tower chiefs logs...

1890
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:04,420
关达那摩和安德鲁斯指挥塔的飞行日志
for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Air Force Base.

1891
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:07,880
关达那摩没有航班在二十三点离开的记录
The Guantanamo log lists no flight that left at 11:00 p.m.

1892
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,550
安德鲁斯也没有航班在两点降落的记录
The Andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2:00 a.m.

1893
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:13,220
辩方希望能从两个基地得到证实
I'd like to admit them as defense exhibits Alpha and Bravo.

1894
02:03:13,930 --> 02:03:17,510
什么意思？ 你想证实一趟从没有过的航班吗？
I don't understand. You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed.

1895
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:20,060
我们相信有，大人
We believe it did, sir.

1896
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:23,440
辩方请求传空军 奥马雷和罗德瑞格作证
Defense will be calling Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Rodriguez.

1897
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:26,520
他们是七号两点种时当班的地勤人员
They were working the ground crew at Andrews at 2:00 a.m. On the 7th.

1898
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:29,440
他们不在证人名单上 第三度答辩证人…
These men weren't on the list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor...

1899
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,820
是特许被传唤 在直接盘问下提供证词的
called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination.

1900
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:36,870
请求通过 真是荒谬
I'll allow the witnesses. This is ridiculous.

1901
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:41,410
上校，刚才… 看在上帝份上，查查指挥塔的飞行日志吧
Colonel, a moment ago... Check the tower logs, for God's sake!

1902
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:44,500
现在有空军可以证实，长官
We'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir.

1903
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:47,460
你刚才说曾命令肯德瑞克…
A moment ago you said that you ordered Lieutenant Kendrick...

1904
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:51,590
告诉他的手下不许碰圣地亚哥
to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1905
02:03:51,590 --> 02:03:53,170
没错
That's right.

1906
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:56,010
但他是不是清楚你的命令？
And Lieutenant Kendrick was clear on what you wanted?

1907
02:03:56,010 --> 02:03:57,840
完全清楚
Crystal.

1908
02:03:57,890 --> 02:04:01,100
他有没有可能忽视这个命令？
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick ignored the order?

1909
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:03,140
忽视这个命令？
Ignored the order?

1910
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:06,310
他有没有可能忘记呢？ 不
Any chance he forgot about it?

1911
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:10,120
有没有可能他离开你的办公室后说 “老头子错了”呢？
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick left your office and said, "The old man is wrong"?

1912
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:11,950
不
No

1913
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,820
当肯德瑞克上尉告诉手下…
When Lieutenant Kendrick spoke to the platoon...

1914
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:18,200
不许碰圣地亚哥时 他们有没有可能当成耳边风？
and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him?

1915
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:22,620
你曾在步兵团服过役吗，小子？
You ever served in an infantry unit, son?

1916
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:26,000
没有，长官 曾经上过前线吗？
No, sir. Ever served in a forward area?

1917
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:30,340
没有，长官 有没有把性命交给过别人…
Ever put your life in another man's hands?

1918
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:33,800
或让别人把性命托付给你？ 没有，长官
Asked him to put his life in yours?

1919
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:36,260
我们要服从命令，小子
We follow orders, son.

1920
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:39,340
得服从命令，不然就会出人命
We follow orders, or people die.

1921
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:42,560
就这么简单，听明白了吗？
It's that simple. Are we clear?

1922
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,430
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1923
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:46,230
听明白没有？
Are we clear?

1924
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:48,270
完全明白
Crystal.

1925
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:55,070
在我盘问奥马雷和罗德瑞格之前 还有个问题
I have just one more question before I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez.

1926
02:04:56,240 --> 02:05:00,570
既然你下了命令不许碰圣地亚哥…
If you gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched...

1927
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:03,200
而你的命令总是能得到遵从…
and your orders are always followed...

1928
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:08,290
那圣地亚哥为什么会有危险？
then why would Santiago be in danger?

1929
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:13,960
为什么他必须被调离基地呢？
Why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?

1930
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:22,640
圣地亚哥是一名不合格的陆战队员
Santiago was a substandard Marine.

1931
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:25,100
他被调走… 你刚才可没这样说
He was being transferred... That's not what you said!

1932
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:28,810
你说要调走他是因为他有生命危险 是的
You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger.

1933
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:31,810
我说 “致命的危险吗？” 你说 “还能是什么？”
I said, "Grave danger?" You said, "Is there any other kind?"

1934
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:34,400
我记得我说过什么 我可以念给你听
I recall what I said. I can have it read back to you.

1935
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:37,490
我知道我说过什么，用不着念给我听
I know what I said! I don't have to have it read back to me.

1936
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:41,200
那为什么有两项命令？上校？
Then why the two orders? Colonel?

1937
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:45,790
有时候那些手下会自作主张
Sometimes men take matters into their own hands.

1938
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:48,960
你说得很清楚，你的部下决不会自作主张
You've made it clear that your men never take matters into their own hands.

1939
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,000
他们得服从命令，否则会出人命
Your men follow orders, or people die.

1940
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,710
那圣地亚哥应不应该有危险呢？
So Santiago should have been in danger, should he?

1941
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:57,630
你这个无礼的小杂种 大人，我请求休庭
You snotty little bastard. I'd like to ask for a recess.

1942
02:05:57,630 --> 02:06:01,390
我要求证人回答这个问题 请证人回答问题
I'd like an answer to the question. The court will wait for an answer.

1943
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:04,510
既然肯德瑞克曾经下令…
If Lieutenant Kendrick gave an order...

1944
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:07,560
不许碰圣地亚哥…
that Santiago wasn't to be touched...

1945
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,520
那他为什么非得调走？
then why did he have to be transferred?

1946
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:11,810
上校？
Colonel?

1947
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:16,650
肯德瑞克下“红色条规”令 是因为你授意他那样去做
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered the Code Red because that's what you told him to do!

1948
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:19,740
反对 然后你却让他们做替罪羊
Object! And then you cut these guys loose!

1949
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:23,370
我要告你藐视法庭 你还窜改了飞行日志
I'll hold you in contempt. You doctored the logbook!

1950
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:26,290
该死的，凯菲 是你在藐视法庭
Damn it, Kaffee! Consider yourself in contempt.

1951
02:06:26,290 --> 02:06:29,160
杰赛普上校 是你下的“红色条规”令吗？
Colonel Jessup, did you order the Code Red?

1952
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:32,790
你不必回答这个问题 我要回答
You don't have to answer that. I'll answer the question.

1953
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:34,880
你想要答案？ 我有这个权利
You want answers? I think I'm entitled!

1954
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:37,380
你想知道答案？ 我想知道事实
You want answers? I want the truth!

1955
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:40,550
你受不了这个事实
You can't handle the truth!

1956
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:45,300
小子，我们生活的世界 需要有人手持武器来守卫边疆
Son, we live in a world that has walls... and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns.

1957
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:49,770
谁来守卫？是你？ 还是你，温伯格中尉？
Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg?

1958
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:53,810
我的责任比你们能想象到的要重要得多
I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.

1959
02:06:53,810 --> 02:06:57,360
你为圣地亚哥抱屈 却来折腾这些海军陆战队员
You weep for Santiago, and you curse the Marines.

1960
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:01,280
你有幸不必知道我知道的事…
You have the luxury of not knowing what I know...

1961
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:05,450
圣地亚哥的死固然是个悲剧 但可能拯救了更多的性命
that Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives.

1962
02:07:05,450 --> 02:07:11,410
至于我的存在方式，对你来说是怪异 和不可理解的，但却是在拯救生命
And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives!

1963
02:07:11,410 --> 02:07:15,630
你不想面对这个事实 是因为你未曾提起的潜意识里…
You don't want the truth because deep down you don't talk about...

1964
02:07:15,630 --> 02:07:17,840
你需要我来保家卫国
you want me on that wall.

1965
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,630
你需要我来保家卫国
You need me on that wall!

1966
02:07:20,630 --> 02:07:25,340
我们惯用的词语是尊严，军规，忠诚
We use words like honor, code, loyalty.

1967
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:29,140
对这些词语我们不惜用生命来捍卫
We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something.

1968
02:07:29,140 --> 02:07:31,180
你们却拿来当儿戏
You use them as a punch line.

1969
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:35,100
我既没有时间也没有兴趣 向你这种人作解释
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself...

1970
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:39,360
你在我提供的自由被褥下高枕无忧 却反过来质疑…
to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the freedom I provide...

1971
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:42,280
我提供自由的方式
and then questions the manner in which I provide it!

1972
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:45,610
我看你最好是说声谢谢然后滚到一边去
I would rather you just said thank you and went on your way.

1973
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:49,450
否则，我建议你拿上武器去站岗
Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post.

1974
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:54,410
不然休想我给你 你自以为该有的什么鬼权利
Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to!

1975
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:56,120
是你下的“红色条规”令吗？
Did you order the Code Red?

1976
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:58,130
我身负重任… 是你下的命令吗？
I did the job... Did you order the Code Red?

1977
02:07:58,170 --> 02:08:00,550
该死的，没错，是我
You're goddamned right I did!

1978
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:14,730
法官大人，我提议让陪审团回避…
Please the court, I suggest the members be dismissed...

1979
02:08:14,730 --> 02:08:18,020
然后直接依据39-Ａ条款开庭
so that we can move to an immediate Article 39-A session.

1980
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:20,520
这是证人的权利
