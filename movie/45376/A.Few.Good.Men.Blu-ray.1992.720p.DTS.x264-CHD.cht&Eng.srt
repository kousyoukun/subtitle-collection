00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,480
古巴 關達那摩灣 美國海軍基地

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,240
<i><b><font color=#FFFF80>義海雄風</b></i>

3
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,460
齊步走！
Forward march!

4
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,970
我請求
I'm requesting...

5
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,180
上校，我想請求由我擔任律師
Captain, I'd like to request that it be me who's the attorney...

6
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,020
這是我自己決定的
That it be myself who's assigned.

7
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,940
不行，我想請求指任我作
No, I'd like to request that it be I who am assigned...

8
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,650
「這是我的決定」？
"That it be I who am assigned"?

9
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,070
這樣不錯，顯得信心十足
That's good. That's confidence-inspiring.

10
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,030
措辭也很得體
Good grammar there.

11
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,280
上校，我想請求指任我為律師
Captain, I'd like to request...

12
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,950
上校，我想請求指任我為律師
<font size=18 color=#9B9BFF>華盛頓哥倫比亞特區  法務總監辦事處
that I be the attorney assigned.

13
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,580
嗨，我是蓋洛維少校，來這見威斯特上校
I'm Lieutenant Commander Galloway here to see Captain West.

14
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,540
快進去吧，少校，他們正等著你
Go right in, Commander. They're expecting you.

15
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,040
謝謝
Thank you.

16
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,550
喬，快進來 謝謝，長官
Jo, come on in. Thank you, sir.

17
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,640
威斯特上校，這就是蓋洛維少校
Captain West, this is Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

18
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,060
喬，你認識勞倫斯少校吧？ 是的，長官
Jo, you know Commander Lawrence. Yes, sir.

19
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,270
上校，很感謝你這麼快就接見我
Captain, I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.

20
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,940
幹嘛不坐下？ 不用，長官
Would you like to sit down? I'm fine, sir.

21
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,480
坐吧 好的
Have a seat. Okay.

22
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,730
我聽說上週末在古巴出了麻煩是吧？
I understand we had some trouble over the weekend down in Cuba?

23
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,110
是的，長官，上週五有兩名海軍陸戰隊員
Yes, sir. This past Friday, two Marines...

24
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,160
准下士哈羅德·道森 和一等兵勞登·多尼
a Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and a Private Louden Downey...

25
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,410
進入一等兵威廉·聖地亞哥的營房 並毆打了他
entered the barracks room of a P.F.C. William Santiago and assaulted him.

26
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,000
大約一小時後聖地亞哥在基地醫院身亡
Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later.

27
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,580
負責給道森和多尼錄取口供 的海軍調查處官員…
The N.I.S. Agent who took Dawson and Downey's statements...

28
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,960
認定他們是想試圖阻止聖地亞哥…
maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago...

29
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,880
舉報道森在界線上的開槍事件
from naming Dawson in a fenceline shooting incident.

30
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,720
已安排今天下午四點 在基地舉行一次聽證會
They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba this afternoon at 16:00.

31
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,680
問題在哪？ 道森和多尼…
What's the problem? Dawson and Downey...

32
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,100
都是模範海軍陸戰隊員 而聖地亞哥是有名的落後分子
are both recruiting poster Marines, and Santiago was known to be a screwup.

33
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,980
我猜這多半是一次「紅色條規」
I was thinking it sounded an awful lot like a Code Red.

34
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,270
老天
Christ.

35
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,070
長官，我希望將他們移交華盛頓 並為他們指派一名
Sir, I'd like to have them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel...

36
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,400
能認真調查此事
someone who can really look into this...

37
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,860
不僅精通法律技巧…
someone who possesses not only the legal skill...

38
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,870
而且熟知軍隊內部運作方式的律師
but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military.

39
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,450
簡而言之，上校，我提議…
In short, Captain, I'd like to suggest that...

40
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,450
由我來擔任
I be the one who that...

41
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,670
指派我作他們的辯護律師
that it be me who is assigned to represent them... myself.

42
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,300
蓋洛維少校，你要不要來杯咖啡？
Commander Galloway, why don'tyou get yourself a cup of coffee?

43
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,380
謝謝，長官，不用
Thank you, sir. I'm fine.

44
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,640
我希望你能迴避一下好讓我們私下談談
I'd like you to leave the room so we can talk about you behind your back.

45
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
沒問題，長官
Certainly, sir.

46
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,480
我還以為再也不會有什麼「紅色條規」了
I thought this Code Red shit wasn't going on anymore.

47
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,650
海軍遠在關達那摩 誰知道在那有些什麼鬼事？
With the Marines at Gitmo, who knows what the hell goes on down there?

48
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,690
我們最好在其他人知道之前查清楚
We better find out before the rest of the world does.

49
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,780
這種鬼事有可能弄得無法收拾
Damn thing could get messy.

50
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,410
好吧，這個蓋洛維少校怎麼樣？
All right, what about this Commander Galloway?

51
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,620
她在內政部擔任文職人員…
She's been working a desk in Internal Affairs...

52
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,580
有一年多了
for a little over a year now.

53
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,670
之前呢？ 兩年內辦過三個案子
Before that? Disposed of three cases in two years.

54
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,580
兩年三件案子？羅森博格叛國案嗎？
Three cases in two years? Who's she handling, the Rosenbergs?

55
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,170
她不適合做首席律師 但絕對是個好調查員
She's not cut out for litigation. She's a hell of an investigator.

56
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,760
她在內政部協助律師工作非常盡力
In Internal Affairs she can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best of them.

57
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,680
但到了庭訊的時候 我知道，心有餘而力不足
But when it comes to trial work... I know. All passion, no street smarts.

58
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,640
叫她進來吧
Bring her back in.

59
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,110
少校，我們明早就將被告轉到這裡來
Commander, we're gonna have the defendants moved up here in the morning.

60
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,360
謝謝，長官 師部會給他們指派律師
Thankyou, sir. Division will assign them counsel.

61
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,790
但…不是我 根據你的同事對你的評價…
But not me. From what I get from your colleagues...

62
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,200
由你擔任此事太過大材小用…
you're much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted...

63
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,330
我相信此案無非是幾分鐘的庭辯…
in what I'm sure will boil down to a five-minute plea bargain...

64
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,330
以及一個禮拜的文書工作
and a week's worth of paperwork.

65
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,540
長官，我想恐怕沒這麼簡單
Sir, I think there might be more involved than that.

66
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,050
別擔心
Don't worry about it.

67
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,050
我保證師部會為此指派合適的人選
I promise you Division will assign the right man for the job.

68
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,430
好了，來吧，拿下二壘
All right. Let's go. Let's get two.

69
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,220
抱歉 用不著抱歉，切比
Sorry. Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.

70
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,470
你只要把球接住就行
You just look the ball into your glove.

71
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,930
第二投
Shooting two.

72
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,730
對不起 你得相信我，切比
Sorry. You gotta trust me, Sherby.

73
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,570
你只要集中精神就能提高接住的成功率
Keep your eyes open, your chances of catching it increase by a factor often.

74
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,480
凱菲 我們再試試
Kaffee. Let's try it again.

75
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,650
戴維，你精神失常嗎？
Dave, you seem distraught.

76
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,490
麥德摩的案子 我們約好在十五分鐘前會面的
We were supposed to meet 15 minutes ago about the McDermott case.

77
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,280
你是在拖延時間，現在我們馬上著手…
You're stalling on this thing. Now we either do it now...

78
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,950
不然我就把你的當事人送上他媽的絞架
or, no kidding, Kaffee, I'm gonna hang your boy from a fucking yardarm!

79
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,000
絞架？切比，海軍還在用絞架行刑嗎？
Yardarm? Sherby, does the Navy still hang people from yardarms?

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,460
我看不會
I don't think so.

81
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,920
戴維，切比認為海軍不會再採用絞刑
Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy hangs people from yardarms anymore.

82
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,340
我要指控他藏毒並在值勤期間吸毒
I'm gonna charge him with possession and being under the influence on duty.

83
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,600
你勸他認罪的話 我可以建議判他三十天監禁
You plead guilty, I'll recommend 30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay.

84
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
那是「牛至」，戴維 只值十美元的調味品
It was oregano, Dave. It was $10 worth of oregano.

85
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,600
可他認為是大麻
Yeah, well, your client thought it was marijuana.

86
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
我的當事人是個傻瓜，但傻並不違法
My client's a moron. That's not against the law.

87
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,900
凱菲，我同樣得給上面一個交代 我必須起訴他
Kaffee, I got people to answer to just like you do. I'm gonna charge him.

88
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,150
告他私藏調味品嗎？
With what, possession of a condiment?

89
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,820
凱菲 我很想幫你了結此事…
Kaffee. I tried to help you out of this...

90
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,620
但說到監禁時間，我會申請撤訴
but if you ask for jail time, I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

91
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,530
你辦不到 我會辦到的
You won't get it. I will get it.

92
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,540
如果法官拒絕，我會申請…
And if the M.T.D. Is denied, I'll file a motion...

93
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,460
要求作一次預先取證
seeking to obtain an evidentiary ruling in advance.

94
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,870
然後反對審前監禁
And after that, I'm gonna file against pretrial confinement.

95
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,500
而你得花上三個月來做書面材料…
And you're gonna spend the next three months going blind on paperwork...

96
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,210
就因為一名二等通信兵購買並吸食調味品
because a signalman second-class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano.

97
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,800
再來，拿下二壘
Let's go! Let's get two!

98
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,300
Ｂ級輕罪，二十天監禁
B misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.

99
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,640
Ｃ級輕罪，十五天受限處罰
C misdemeanor, 15 days restricted duty.

100
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,140
不知道我憑什麼要接受
I don't know why I'm agreeing to this.

101
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,480
因為你比一般人要明智
'Cause you have wisdom beyond your years.

102
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,030
早
Morning.

103
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,780
早，上校
Morning, Captain.

104
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,400
孩子怎麼樣，山姆？
How's the baby, Sam?

105
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,700
她大概隨時在準備說出她的第一句話
I think she's getting ready to say her first word any day now.

106
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,330
你怎麼知道？
How can you tell?

107
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,080
她看起來像有什麼話要說
She just looks like she has something to say.

108
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,750
不好意思，抱歉我來晚了
Excuse me. I'm sorry I'm late.

109
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,790
我知道你沒什麼好借口…
It's all right, Danny. I know you don't have a good excuse...

110
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,920
所以不會強迫你找個壞借口
so I won't force you to come up with a bad one.

111
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,960
謝謝，長官 第一件事與你有關
Thank you, sir. This first one's for you.

112
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,380
看來你要飛黃騰達了
Seems you're moving up in the world.

113
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,390
是師部要人
Been requested by Division.

114
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,220
要我去哪？
Requested to do what?

115
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,640
古巴，關達那摩灣
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

116
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,810
一名叫道森的海軍准下士 非法使用所持武器…
A Marine corporal named Dawson illegally fires a round from his weapon...

117
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,730
向界線另一邊的古巴境內開槍
over the fenceline and into Cuban territory.

118
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,690
什麼「界線」？ 山姆
What's a fenceline? Sam.

119
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,990
是一堵把好人和壞人分隔開來的高牆
A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys.

120
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,320
好學生 一等兵威廉·聖地亞哥…
Teacher's pet. P.F.C. William Santiago...

121
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,700
威脅要向海軍調查部門舉報道森
threatens to rat on Dawson to Naval Investigative Service.

122
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,790
道森和他的另一名隊友…
Dawson and another member of his squad...

123
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,880
一等兵勞登·多尼 進入聖地亞哥的房間…
P.F.C. Louden Downey, go into Santiago's room...

124
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,340
把他捆了起來，在他喉嚨裡塞了塊抹布…
tie him up, stuff a rag down his throat...

125
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,460
一小時後，聖地亞哥死了
and an hour later, Santiago's dead.

126
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,260
主治醫師說那塊抹布經過了某種毒藥處理
Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin.

127
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,510
他們下的毒？
They poisoned it?

128
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,600
他們矢口否認 都說了些什麼？
Not according to them. What did they say?

129
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,270
沒說太多，他們明天會乘飛機過來…
Not much. They're being flown up here tomorrow...

130
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,810
週三凌晨六點，你要去古巴呆一天…
and on Wednesday at 0600, you'll catch a transport down to Cuba for the day...

131
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,810
看能找到些什麼
to find out what you can.

132
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:09,740
同時，去見見隸屬內政部的 喬安妮·蓋洛維少校
Meantime, go and see Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway... with Internal Affairs.

133
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,360
有問題嗎？
Any questions?

134
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,580
去古巴的飛機…是在早上六點嗎，長官？
Uh, the flight to Cuba... Was that 0600 in the morning, sir?

135
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,040
看來重點在於師部要依條例行事
Seems important to Division that this one be handled by the book.

136
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,210
所以要我指派辯護律師，有沒有志願者？
So I'm assigning co-counsel. Any volunteers?

137
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,800
不，我手頭的案子太多了
I got a stack of papers on my desk about a mile high.

138
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
去幫幫凱菲吧 去幹什麼？
Work with Kaffee on this. Doing what?

139
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,090
凱菲只要四天就能擺平
Kaffee will have this done in about four days.

140
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,470
做些管理方面的事
Doing various administrative things.

141
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,430
備份什麼的
Backup, whatever.

142
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,100
換句話說，就是我沒有任何責任了
In other words, I have no responsibilities here whatsoever.

143
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,640
沒錯
Right.

144
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,810
正合我意
My kind of case.

145
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,900
對
Right.

146
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,480
好的，但我要週三才能拿到報告
Okay, but I've got to have that report by Wednesday.

147
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,580
嗨 稍等一下，嗨
Hi. Hold on. Hi.

148
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,000
丹尼·凱菲，我是來見
Daniel Kaffee. I was told to me with, uh...

149
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,380
蓋洛維少校的
Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

150
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,800
來瞭解一下情況
About a briefing?

151
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,850
我回頭打給你
I'll call you back.

152
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,520
你是師部指定的律師？
You're the attorney Division assigned?

153
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,350
我是首席律師，這是山姆
I'm lead counsel. This is Sam Weinberg.

154
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,610
我對此事不負任何責任
I have no responsibilities here whatsoever.

155
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,820
進來吧，請坐
Come in, please. Have a seat.

156
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,450
中尉，你在海軍服役多久了？
Lieutenant, how long have you been in the Navy?

157
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,040
快九個月了
Going on nine months now.

158
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,750
你從律師學校畢業多久了？
And how long have you been out of law school?

159
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,380
一年多一點
A little over a year.

160
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,550
明白了
I see.

161
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,880
我做錯什麼了嗎？
Have I done something wrong?

162
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,640
不，只是我請求師部指派律師時…
It's just that when I petition Division to have counsel assigned...

163
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,720
還指望會被認真對待
I was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

164
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,470
恕我冒昧，實際上確實如此
No offense taken, in case you were wondering.

165
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,850
凱菲中尉被公認是 我們部門最會打官司的人
Commander, Lieutenant Kaffee is generally... considered the best litigator in our office.

166
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,150
九個月內他成功地處理過四十四起案件
He's successfully plea-bargained 44 cases in nine months.

167
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,230
再多一件就能獎一套牛排刀
One more, I get a set of steak knives.

168
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,070
你上過庭嗎？
Have you ever been in a courtroom?

169
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,700
駕照被吊銷時上過一次
I once had my driver's license suspended.

170
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,740
以我的看法，如果鬧上法庭…
Commander, from what I understand, if this thing goes to court...

171
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,950
他們需要的就不是律師而是牧師
they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest.

172
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,540
不，他們需要的是律師
No, they'll need a lawyer.

173
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,660
已經聯繫過道森的家人
Dawson's family's been contacted.

174
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,290
多尼最親近的人是他姨媽詹妮·米勒
Downey's closest living relative is Ginny Miller, his aunt.

175
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,250
還沒和她聯繫過，需要我來處理嗎？
She hasn't been contacted yet. Would you like me to take care of that?

176
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,800
如果你願意的話
If you feel like it.

177
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,510
你到那要見的人…
One of the people you'll be seeing down there...

178
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,640
是基地指揮官內森·傑賽普上校
is the barracks C.O., Colonel Nathan Jessup.

179
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,850
我猜你也聽說過他
I assume you've heard of him.

180
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,350
誰沒聽說過呢？
Who hasn't?

181
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,060
他最近上了報，可能被任命為…
He's been in the papers lately. He's expected to be appointed...

182
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,940
國家安全委員會的執行主管
director of operations of National Security Council.

183
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,270
是嗎？ 這些信…
Really? These are the letters...

184
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,690
是聖地亞哥在關達那摩寫的
that Santiago wrote in his eight months at Gitmo.

185
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,240
就是關達那摩灣 我知道
That's Guantanamo Bay. I knew that one.

186
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,820
他曾寫給艦隊司令 寫給海軍指揮部的指揮官…
He wrote to the fleet commander to the commandant of the Marine Corps.

187
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,830
甚至議員，他希望能調離基地
Even his senator. He wanted to be transferred off the base.

188
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,790
但沒人理會，你在聽嗎？
No one was listening. Are you with me? Yeah.

189
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,000
最後，他寫給海軍調查處…
Finally, he wrote to the Naval Investigative Service...

190
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,130
以提供道森准下士非法開槍的資料…
where he offered information about Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting...

191
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,840
作為調動的交換條件
in exchange for a transfer.

192
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,550
很好，就這些嗎？
Right. Is that all?

193
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,510
中尉，這些信似乎提供了…
Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like...

194
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,050
你當事人殺害聖地亞哥的動機
your client had a motive to kill Santiago.

195
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,390
明白了，聖地亞哥是誰？
Got you. And Santiago is who?

196
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,020
被害人
The victim.

197
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,770
寫下來，可否假設這些信…
Write that down. Am I correct to assume these letters...

198
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,730
描述的並非關達那摩的光彩之處呢？
don't paint a flattering picture of Marine Corps life at Guantanamo Bay?

199
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,230
對，在 進一步地假設…
Yes, among... Am I further right in assuming...

200
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,150
調查此事有沒有可能 令安全委員會的人難堪呢？
investigation of this incident might embarrass the Security Council guy?

201
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,240
傑賽普上校 十二年
Colonel Jessup. Twelve years.

202
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,160
什麼？
Sorry?

203
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,490
爭取判為共謀及行為不當
I'll get them to drop the conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

204
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,330
刑期十二年
Twelve years.

205
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,040
你沒和證人談過也沒看過一頁檔案
You haven't talked to a witness or looked at a piece of paper.

206
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,170
很意外，對吧？
Pretty impressive, huh?

207
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,920
你應該深入調查
You're gonna have to go deeper than that.

208
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,800
你有什麼權限是我應該知道的？
Do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that I should know about?

209
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,680
我的工作就是確保你幹好你的工作
My job is to make sure that you do your job.

210
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
我是內政部的特別律師…
I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs...

211
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,180
所以我的權限可說就是看著你
so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face.

212
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,350
看看這些信 希望你從古巴回來能向我匯報
Read the letters. I'll expect your report when you return from Cuba.

213
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,110
當然 你可以走了
Sure. You're dismissed.

214
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,690
我總是忘了這個部分
I always forget that part.

215
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,240
他有點分心
He's a little preoccupied.

216
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,490
下周要和貝賽斯塔醫院隊比賽
Team's playing Bethesda Medical next week.

217
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,450
告訴他在那可別抖機靈
Tell your friend not to get cute down there.

218
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,870
關達那摩的海軍可不好惹
The Marines in Guantanamo are fanatical.

219
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,210
哪方面？
About what?

220
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,630
海軍方面
About being Marines.

221
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,710
尊敬的長官…
Dear sir...

222
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,590
我是一等兵威廉·Ｔ·聖地亞哥
my name is P.F.C. William T. Santiago.

223
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:45,260
是隸屬海軍陸戰隊Ｗ步兵警衛連二Ｂ排 的一名海軍陸戰隊員
I'm a Marine stationed at Marine barracks... Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Bravo.

224
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,140
我寫信是想告知您 我在古巴單位上遇到的麻煩…
I'm writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba...

225
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,810
並請求您的幫助
and to ask for your help.

226
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,270
我之前曾因某種原因在訓練時暈倒…
I've fallen out on runs before for several reasons...

227
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,270
感覺像是頭暈或噁心
such as feeling dizzy or nauseated.

228
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:02,690
但在五月十八日，從一座小石山下來時 我落後了大約二到三十碼
But on May 18, I'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards... going down a rocky unstable hill.

229
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,740
我的中士抓住我並把我向山下推
My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill.

230
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,700
然後我眼前一黑，摔倒在地上
Then I saw all black, and the last thing I remembered was hitting the deck.

231
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,160
到醫院後我被告知只是中暑而已
I was brought to the hospital where I was told I just had heat exhaustion.

232
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,790
我請求您幫助我
I ask you to help me.

233
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,380
求您，長官，我想要調離步兵警衛連
Please, sir. I just need to be transferred out of R.S.C.

234
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,920
美國海軍陸戰隊一等兵 威廉·Ｔ·聖地亞哥 謹啟
Sincerely, P.F.C. William T. Santiago... U.S. Marine Corps.

235
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,970
另附，作為我調離基地的交換條件…
P.S. In exchange for my transfer off the base...

236
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,010
我可以向您提供有關
I'm willing to provide you with information about...

237
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,430
「八月二日夜間向境外非法開槍事件」 的信息
"The illegal fenceline shooting that occurred the night of August 2."

238
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,690
這個該死的一等兵 威廉·聖地亞哥是什麼人？
Who the fuck is P.F.C. William T. Santiago?

239
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,860
是隸屬第二Ｂ排的一名一等兵，長官
Private Santiago is a member of Second Platoon Bravo, sir.

240
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,110
是嗎，他似乎在「香格里拉」 呆得很不開心啊…
Yeah. Well, apparently he's not very happy down here in Shangri-la...

241
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,240
因為他給聖誕老人之外的所有人寫信 請求調離
because he's written letters to everybody but Santa Claus... asking for a transfer.

242
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,290
而且還要披露一樁違紀開槍事件
And now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting.

243
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,870
馬修？
Matthew?

244
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,540
我感到震驚，長官
I'm appalled, sir.

245
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,790
你感到震驚
You're appalled.

246
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,380
這小子越級上報還出賣自己的隊友…
This kid broke the chain of command and ratted on a member of his unit...

247
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,260
謊稱他作為一名海軍陸戰隊員…
to say nothing of the fact that he is a U.S. Marine...

248
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,930
就算沒有中暑虛脫，似乎也無法參加訓練
and it would appear he can't run from here to there... without collapsing from heat exhaustion.

249
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,270
Ｂ排是他媽的怎麼回事，馬修？
What the fuck is going on in Bravo Company, Matthew?

250
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,360
上校，我想這事最好還是等私下再談
Colonel, I think it would be better to hold this discussion in private.

251
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,570
沒必要，上校，我可以處理好這事，長官
That won't be necessary, Colonel. I can handle the situation, sir.

252
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:29,360
像你處理柯蒂斯·貝爾那樣嗎？ 別打斷我，上尉
The same way you handled Curtis Bell? Don't interrupt me, Lieutenant!

253
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,990
我還是你的上級 而我是你的上級，馬修
I'm still your superior officer. And I'm yours, Matthew.

254
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,210
我想知道我們該如何處理這事
I wanna know what we're going to do about this.

255
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,210
我認為聖地亞哥應該馬上調離基地
I think Santiago should be transferred off the base immediately.

256
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,880
他那樣差勁嗎？
He's that bad, huh?

257
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,090
除此之外，信的內容一傳出去…
Not only that. But word of this letter is bound to get out.

258
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,090
他可就有得受了
He's gonna get his ass whipped.

259
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,220
調走聖地亞哥
Hmm. Transfer Santiago.

260
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,810
好吧，我相信你是對的
Yes. I'm sure you're right.

261
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,390
我相信就該這麼辦
I'm sure that's the thing to do.

262
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,980
等等，我有個更好的主意
Wait. I've got a better idea.

263
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,020
我們把整個班都調離基地
Let's transfer the whole squad off the base.

264
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,190
我們…接下來考慮，Ｗ
Let's... On second thought, Windward...

265
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,490
我們將整個Ｗ連都調離基地
Let's transfer the whole Windward Division off the base.

266
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,200
約翰，到外邊去把弟兄們都從邊境帶走
John, go on out there and get those boys down off the fence.

267
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,750
他們正在收拾行李，湯姆
They're packing their bags. Tom.

268
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,420
長官 給我接總統
Sir. Get me the president on the phone.

269
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,590
我們要放棄古巴的軍事基地
We're surrendering our position in Cuba.

270
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,090
是，長官 等等，湯姆
Yes, sir. Wait a minute, Tom.

271
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,090
先不要接總統
Don't get the president just yet.

272
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,800
也許我們該考慮一下
Maybe we should consider this for a second.

273
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,140
出去吧，湯姆 是，長官
Dismissed, Tom. Yes, sir.

274
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,100
也許…我剛才是胡說八道
Maybe... and I'm just spit-balling here...

275
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,230
也許作為長官我們有責任訓練聖地亞哥
Maybe we have a responsibility as officers to train Santiago.

276
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,440
也許作為長官我們有責任為國家…
Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country...

277
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,820
看著那些肩負國家安全重任的人…
to see that the men and women charged with its security...

278
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,950
受到專業的訓練
are trained professionals.

279
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,950
沒錯，我確信在什麼地方看到過這些話
Yes, I'm certain that I read that somewhere once.

280
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,620
我現在想的是，馬金森中校…
And now I'm thinking, Colonel Markinson...

281
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,040
你提議調走聖地亞哥…
that your suggestion of transferring Santiago...

282
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,340
痛快固然是痛快…
while expeditious and certainly painless...

283
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,890
但恐怕不是美國人處理事情的方式
might not be, in a manner of speaking... the American way.

284
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,760
聖地亞哥必須留在這
Santiago stays where he is.

285
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,770
我們要訓練這個小伙子
We're gonna train the lad.

286
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,810
約翰，由你負責
John, you're in charge.

287
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:33,780
如果聖地亞哥下次的訓練和實習報告 還達不到四-六-四-六的話
Santiago doesn't make 4-6-4-6... on his next proficiency and conduct report...

288
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,160
我唯你是問
I'm going to blame you.

289
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,870
我會斃了你 是，長官
Then I'm going to kill you. Yes, sir.

290
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,540
我認為這是個錯誤，上校
I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

291
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,080
馬修，我想我有些話要和你私下聊聊
Matthew, I think I will have that word in private with you now.

292
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,130
約翰，就這樣吧 我們午飯時在軍官俱樂部碰頭…
John, that's all. Why don't we meet at the "O" club and have lunch...

293
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,800
討論怎樣訓練小威廉
and we'll talk about the training of young William?

294
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,590
我很樂意聽聽您的建議，長官
I'd be delighted to hear any suggestions that you might have, sir.

295
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,590
出去吧 是，長官
Dismissed. Yes, sir.

296
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,640
馬修，請坐下
Matthew, sit down. Please.

297
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,400
你覺得肯德瑞克怎麼樣？
What doyou think of Kendrick?

298
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,280
我對他的看法毫無
My opinion of him has nothing to do...

299
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,530
就我個人而言我覺得他不太靠得住…
I think he's pretty much of a weasel myself...

300
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,570
但他是個很不錯的軍官
but he's an awfully good officer.

301
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,080
我們最終的目的 就是要訓練一支最好的海軍陸戰隊
And in the end, we see eye-to-eye on the best way to run a Marine Corps unit.

302
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,710
保家衛國是我們份內的事，馬修
We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew.

303
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,460
這是我們該認真對待的職責
That is a responsibility that we have to take pretty seriously.

304
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,880
我相信對於這樣一名 不稱職的海軍陸戰隊員…
And I believe that taking a Marine who is not quite up to the job...

305
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,430
把他送到其他單位…
and shipping him off to another assignment...

306
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,470
是拿生命當兒戲
puts lives in danger.

307
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,520
坐下，馬修
Sit down, Matthew.

308
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,070
想想過去吧
We go back a while.

309
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,660
我們一同上軍校，一同接受任命
We went to the Academy together. We were commissioned together.

310
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,200
一同經歷過越戰
We did our tours in Vietnam together.

311
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,620
只不過我得到的一系列提升…
But I've been promoted up through the chain...

312
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,620
比起你來要運氣好一些
with greater speed and success than you have.

313
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,670
現在，如果是因為這個…
Now, if that's a source of tension...

314
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,670
令你感到難堪…
or embarrassment foryou...

315
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,500
我不會太在意
I don't give a shit.

316
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,800
我們的職責性命攸關，馬金森中校
We're in the business of saving lives, Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.

317
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,010
永遠別在其他軍官面前質疑我的命令
Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer.

318
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,370
所有材料都準備好了
All the paperwork's in order.

319
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,410
過去吧 是，長官
Step over there. Yes, sir.

320
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,880
哈羅德，這就是華盛頓特區？
Hal, is this Washington, D. C?

321
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,550
對，我們走吧
All right. Let's move.

322
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,050
是，長官
Yes, sir.

323
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,890
這一擊能拿滿分 打擾一下
Got all of that one. Excuse me.

324
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,560
我想和你談談道森和多尼的事
I wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.

325
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,230
什麼？ 道森和多尼
Say again? Dawson and Downey.

326
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,480
這些名字聽起來和我有點關係
Those names sound like they should mean something to me...

327
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,400
道森，多尼…你的當事人
Dawson, Downey... your clients.

328
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,780
古巴的事，對了，道森和多尼，沒錯
The Cuba thing. Yes! Dawson and Downey. Right.

329
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,040
我又做錯了什麼嗎？
I've done something wrong again, haven't I?

330
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,960
我只是奇怪那兩個人一早就被關押的同時 他們的律師卻在打球
I was just wondering why two guys have been locked up... since this morning while their lawyer's outside hitting a ball.

331
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,630
我們需要訓練
We need the practice.

332
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,250
這並不好笑
That wasn't funny.

333
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,380
有一點點好笑
It was a little funny.

334
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,760
如果我向你的上司建議另外指派律師 會不會令你感到羞辱？
Would you be very insulted if I recommended to your supervisor... that he assign different counsel?

335
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,310
理由呢？ 我認為你不適合辦理此案
Why? I don't think you're fit to handle it.

336
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,140
你根本不瞭解我 一般來說，總得花些時間…
You don't even know me. Ordinarily, it takes someone hours...

337
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,860
來瞭解我適不適合作辯護律師
to discover I'm not fit to handle a defense.

338
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,990
得了吧，這未免太可笑了
Oh, come on. That was damn funny.

339
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,070
你錯了
You're wrong.

340
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,160
我瞭解你
I do know you.

341
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,080
丹尼·艾勒斯塔·凱菲 一九六四年六月八日生於…
Daniel Alistair Kaffee, born June 8, 1964...

342
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
波士頓仁愛醫院
at Boston Mercy Hospital.

343
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,460
你父親萊昂內爾·凱菲…
Your father's Lionel Kaffee...

344
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,050
曾擔任海軍軍法檢察官及美國司法部長
former Navy judge advocate and attorney general of the United States.

345
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,670
一九八五年去世
Died 1985.

346
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,510
你上過哈佛法學院，畢業後加入海軍…
You went to Harvard law. Then you joined the Navy...

347
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,340
也許這是出於你父親的要求
probably because that's what your father wanted you to do.

348
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,760
所以現在你只想在海軍軍法署混上三年
And now you're just treading water for three years in the JAG Corps.

349
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,310
混到退役找一份真正的工作
Just laying low till you can get out and get a real job.

350
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,940
如果是這樣的話也無可厚非 我不會告訴任何人
If that's the situation, that's fine. I won't tell anyone.

351
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,280
但我認為如果象求快，耍小聰明的 波斯商販那樣來對待本案…
But it's my feeling that if this case is handled in the same... fast-food, slick-ass, Persian bazaar manner...

352
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,240
用你應付其他案子的那一套…
with which you seem to handle everything else...

353
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,950
就會漏掉一些東西
then something's gonna get missed.

354
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,740
如果道森和多尼因為他們的律師…
And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey...

355
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,370
預先就盤算不盡全力而使他們…
to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary...

356
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,540
多受哪怕一天的牢獄之災，就是我的失職
because their attorney had predetermined the path of least resistance.

357
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,340
真令我興奮，少校
I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

358
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,300
我不相信他們會殺人
I don't think your clients murdered anyone.

359
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,720
理由根據呢？
What are you basing this on?

360
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,590
沒有動機
There was no intent.

361
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,510
醫檢報告說聖地亞哥死於窒息…
The doctor's report says Santiago died of asphyxiation...

362
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,520
是因為急性乳酸中毒…
brought on by acute lactic acidosis...

363
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,440
而這種癥狀很容易讓人聯想到是人為的
and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poison.

364
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,270
我不知道這表示什麼，但聽起來相當不妙
I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad.

365
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,230
聖地亞哥是死於凌晨一點
Santiago died at 1:00 a.m.

366
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,150
三點時醫生還無法確定死因
At 3:00, the doctor wasn't able to determine the cause of death.

367
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,450
兩小時後，他說是死於中毒
Two hours later, he said it was poison.

368
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,030
哦，我現在懂你的意思了
Oh, now I see what you're saying.

369
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,410
肯定是圖書館的普拉姆教授 用燭台打死了他
It had to be Professor Plum in the library with a candlestick.

370
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,950
我去和你的上司談好了 行啊
I'm gonna talk to your supervisor. Okay.

371
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,170
直接去賓州林蔭大道
Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue.

372
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,750
找一幢有柱子的白色宮殿
It's the big white house with the pillars in front.

373
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,050
謝了 我覺得你的運氣不會太好
Thank you. I don't think you'll have much luck.

374
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,510
我是由師部任命的
I was assigned by Division.

375
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,680
那兒有人認為我是個很不錯的律師
Somebody over there thinks I'm a pretty good lawyer.

376
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,220
我對你的專注和熱情表示敬佩…
So while I appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm...

377
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,770
但我認為我自己能處理好這事
I think I can handle things myself.

378
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,930
知道什麼是「紅色條規」嗎？
You know what a Code Red is?

379
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,940
真遺憾
What a pity.

380
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,620
早，長官 早
Morning, sir. Morning.

381
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,210
長官到，立正
Officer on deck!

382
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,460
長官，哈羅德·道森准下士，長官
Sir, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson, sir!

383
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,710
隸屬Ｗ步兵警衛連二Ｂ排
Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Bravo.

384
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,090
曾經違紀並且 不能和隊友好好相處的哈羅德？
Someone hasn't been working and playing well with others, Harold.

385
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,050
長官，是的，長官
Sir, yes, sir!

386
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,180
長官，一等兵勞登·多尼，長官
Sir, P.F.C. Louden Downey, sir!

387
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,310
我是丹尼·凱菲，這是山姆·溫伯格
I'm Daniel Kaffee. This is Sam Weinberg.

388
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,470
坐吧
Sit down.

389
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,650
這是你的簽名？ 是的，長官
This your signature? Yes, sir.

390
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,490
用不著叫我長官，這是你的簽名嗎？
You don't have to call me "sir." Is this your signature?

391
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,700
長官，是的，長官
Sir, yes, sir.

392
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,700
完全沒必要一句話叫兩次長官
You certainly don't need to do it twice in one sentence.

393
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,370
什麼是「紅色條規」？ 是一種訓誡條規
What's a Code Red? It is a disciplinary engagement.

394
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,830
表示什麼？
What's that mean?

395
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,830
如果有陸戰隊員掉隊 就可以用來幫助這個隊員跟上隊伍
A Marine falls out of line, it's up to the men in his unit to get him on track.

396
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,380
「紅色條規」具體是什麼花樣？ 長官？
What's a garden variety Code Red? Sir?

397
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,380
哈羅德，你這麼叫會讓我 忍不住回頭看是不是我爸爸來了
Harold, you say, "sir," and I turn around and look for my father.

398
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,010
叫我丹尼，凱菲都行
Danny, Daniel, Kaffee.

399
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,180
說明白點 「紅色條規」大概是什麼意思？
Garden variety. Typical. What's basic Code Red?

400
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,890
長官，比如有隊員拒絕按規定洗澡…
Sir, a Marine refuses to bathe on a regular basis...

401
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,560
隊友就會給他洗個「軍用澡」
the men in his squad will give him a G.I. Shower.

402
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,810
怎麼個洗法？
What's that?

403
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,480
用刷子，鋼絲刷
Scrub brushes, Brillo pads, steel wool.

404
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,810
太妙了
Beautiful.

405
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,480
聖地亞哥接受的也是「紅色條規」嗎？
Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red?

406
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,190
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

407
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,660
他從不說話嗎？
Does he ever talk?

408
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,040
長官，一等兵多尼會回答你的所有問題
Sir, P.F.C. Downey will answer any direct questions you ask him.

409
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,620
非？
Swell.

410
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,050
多尼，你塞進聖地亞哥嘴裡的抹布
Private Downey, the rag you stuffed in Santiago's mouth...

411
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,010
有沒有毒？ 沒有，長官
Was there poison on it? No, sir.

412
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,590
上光劑，松節油，防凍劑之類？
Silver polish, turpentine, antifreeze?

413
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,050
沒有，長官，我們只是想給他剃頭
No, sir. We were just gonna shave his head, sir.

414
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,930
突然之間
When all of the sudden...

415
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,430
我們看到他的嘴在流血…
We saw blood dripping down his mouth...

416
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,690
我們撕掉膠布，他滿臉都是血，長官
and we pulled the tape off and there was blood all down his face, sir.

417
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,020
接著道森准下士就打電話叫了救護車
That's when Lance Corporal Dawson called the ambulance.

418
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,770
有人看到你打電話嗎？
Did anyone see you call the ambulance?

419
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,900
沒有，長官
No, sir.

420
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,160
救護車來時你在那嗎？
Were you there when the ambulance got there?

421
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,620
是的，長官，這時我們已經被拘捕
Yes, sir. That's when we were taken under arrest.

422
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,620
八月二日夜間 你是否在邊界向古巴境內開過槍？
The night of August 2, did you fire a shot across the fenceline into Cuba?

423
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,830
是的，長官 為什麼？
Yes, sir. Why?

424
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,750
我的對象在動手，長官 對像？
My mirror engaged, sir. His mirror?

425
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,670
每個美軍崗哨都有一個對應的古巴崗哨 稱為「對像」
Every American sentry post has a Cuban counterpart, called "mirrors."

426
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:41,220
下士的意思是他的對象想向他開槍
Lance Corporal's claiming that his mirror was about to fire at him.

427
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,760
聖地亞哥寫信給海軍調查處…
Santiago's letter to the N.I. S...

428
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,310
說你違紀開槍
said you fired illegally.

429
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,310
他說那個人，那個對象
He's saying that the guy, the mirror...

430
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,940
決沒有任何行動
He never made a move.

431
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,320
你明白我在說什麼嗎？
You see what I'm getting at?

432
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,660
既然聖地亞哥和你沒有私怨 為何對他執行「紅色條規」？
If Santiago didn't have anything on you, then why did you give him a Code Red?

433
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,910
因為他越級上報，長官
'Cause he broke the chain of command, sir.

434
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,960
什麼？ 他撇開了自己的單位，長官
He what? He went outside of his unit, sir.

435
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,420
如果他有問題，應該先向我報告，長官
If he had a problem, he should have spoken to me, sir.

436
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,550
然後才是中士，指揮官 好了好了
Then his sergeant, then commander... Yeah. All right.

437
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,260
你襲擊他時是否意圖殺死他？
Did you assault Santiago with the intent of killing him?

438
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,970
沒有，長官 意圖何在？
No, sir. What was your intent?

439
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,840
教訓他，長官 教訓他什麼？
To train him, sir. Train him to do what?

440
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,430
考慮個人之前先考慮集體…要尊重秩序
Train him to think of his unit before himself... to respect the code.

441
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,270
什麼秩序？
What's the code?

442
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,350
分隊，軍團，上帝，國家
Unit, Corps, God, Country.

443
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,650
能再說一次嗎？
I beg your pardon?

444
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,230
依次為分隊、軍團、上帝、國家，長官
Unit, Corps, God, Country, sir.

445
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,920
美國政府…
The government of the United States...

446
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,800
要指控你倆謀殺…
wants to charge you two with murder...

447
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,510
你想讓我對起訴人說什麼 分隊，軍團，上帝，國家嗎？
and you want me to go to the prosecutor... with "Unit, Corps, God, Country"?

448
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,560
這是我們的規矩，長官
That's our code, sir.

449
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,350
你們的規矩
It's your code.

450
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,020
我們還會來
We'll be back.

451
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,980
有什麼需要嗎？ 書，紙張，香煙，火腿三明治？
You guys need anything... books, papers, cigarettes, ham sandwich?

452
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,320
長官，不用，謝謝，長官
Sir, no, thank you, sir.

453
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,200
哈羅德，我覺得你最好開始明白一件事
Harold, I think there's a concept you better start warming up to.

454
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,490
長官？
Sir?

455
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,200
我是你們唯一的朋友
I'm the only friend you've got.

456
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,510
丹尼·凱菲
Daniel Kaffee

457
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,590
微笑的傑克·羅斯
Smiling Jack Ross.

458
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,930
歡迎你的加入 是嗎？
Welcome to the big time. You think so?

459
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,890
為道森和多尼著想 但願你的專業水平高於壘球水平
Let's hope, for Dawson and Downey, you practice law better than play softball.

460
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,480
真為他倆遺憾 我沒有什麼能比壘球更擅長
Unfortunately for those two, I don't do anything better than play softball.

461
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,020
我走了，簡奈兒 再見
I'm out of here, Janelle. Bye.

462
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,440
等我從古巴回來再見 代我向卡斯特羅問好
See you when I get back from Cuba. Say hi to Castro for me.

463
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,820
沒問題，有何見教？
Will do. What are we looking at?

464
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,070
他們認罪 就網開一面只告他們共謀及行為不當
They plead guilty, we drop the conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

465
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,410
二十年，十年後就能回家 我想要十二年
Twentyyears. They're home in half. I want 12.

466
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,410
辦不到 他們叫了救護車
Can't do it. They called the ambulance.

467
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,830
我不在乎他們叫過誰，總之他們殺了人
I don't care if they called the Avon lady. They killed a Marine.

468
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,000
那塊抹布化驗過了 法醫和化驗報告都說未必如此
The rag was tested for poison. The autopsy, lab reports. They say the same thing: Maybe, maybe not.

469
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,170
關達那摩灣海軍醫院的內科主任…
Chief of Internal Medicine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Hospital...

470
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,710
說他可以肯定
says he's sure.

471
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,880
你知道「紅色條規」嗎？
What do you know about Code Reds?

472
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,380
哦，老天
Oh, man.

473
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,430
這算私人談話吧？ 說說看
We off the record? Tell me.

474
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,600
就依你的，判十二年
I'm gonna give you the 12 years.

475
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,850
不過你在明天給自己惹麻煩之前該知道…
Before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know...

476
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,060
排長喬納森·肯德瑞克上尉…
the platoon commander, Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

477
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,070
召集手下開過會並且特地…
held a meeting with the men and specifically...

478
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,570
告訴他們別碰聖地亞哥
told them not to touch Santiago.

479
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,030
我們明晚還打籃球嗎？ 算是成交了？
We still playing hoops tomorrow night? Do we have a deal?

480
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,790
等我回來再說
I'll talk toyou when I get back.

481
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,040
你好 找到誰替換我了嗎？
Hi there. Any luck getting me replaced?

482
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,340
是不是部裡所有人都是你的酒友或球友？
Is there anyone in this command you don't either drink or play ball with?

483
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,300
少校 聽著，我是來講和的
Commander... Listen. I came to make peace.

484
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,430
我承認之前對你有誤會 怎麼樣？可以做朋友嗎？
Got off on the wrong foot. What do you say? Friends?

485
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,550
我照多尼的要求給他帶了些漫畫
I brought Downey some comic books he was asking for.

486
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,060
這孩子根本不明白自己的處境
The kid, Kaffee, I swear he doesn't know where he is.

487
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,480
甚至不知為何被捕 少校
Doesn't even know why he's arrested. Commander.

488
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,270
可以叫我喬安妮 喬安妮
You can call me Joanne. Joanne.

489
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,600
喬也可以 好的
Or Jo. Yes.

490
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,690
喬，如果你再私自和我的當事人交談…
Jo, if you ever speak to a client of mine again without my permission...

491
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,280
我就把你排除在外
I'll have you disbarred.

492
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,610
行嗎，朋友？ 有人授權給我
Friends? I had authorization.

493
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,450
誰？ 多尼最親的親人
From where? Downey's closest living relative.

494
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,080
詹妮·米勒，他的姨媽
Ginny Miller. His aunt on his mother's side.

495
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,500
詹妮·米勒授權給了你？
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?

496
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,540
我照你的要求給她打了電話
I gave her a call like you asked.

497
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,040
很不錯的女人，我們聊了將近一小時
Very nice woman. We spoke for about an hour.

498
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,630
詹妮·米勒授權給了你
You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.

499
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,380
我完全有這個權利
Perfectly within my province.

500
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,880
她有車庫嗎？我們可以在那庭審
Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We could hold the trial there.

501
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,100
我懂縫紉，沒準能給他叔叔縫件法官制服
I can sew the costumes. Maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge.

502
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,060
我明天和你一起去古巴
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

503
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,860
看來好戲還在後頭
And the hits just keep on coming.

504
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,470
過得怎麼樣，盧瑟？ 多活一天算一天，中尉
How's it going, Luther? Another day, another dollar, captain.

505
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,720
看來你是聽天由命了 愛怎麼著怎麼著吧
You gotta play them as they lay. What goes around comes around.

506
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,220
惹不起就投降好了 至少我的身體還行
Can't beatthem, joingem. At least I got my health.

507
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,060
這比什麼都實在，明天見，盧瑟
Well, then you got everything. See you tomorrow, Luther.

508
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,060
我可會躲著你
Not if I seeyou first.

509
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,400
別忘了莎莉回來時給我作證
Now don't forget. When Sally gets back, you're my witness.

510
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,780
孩子說話了，我女兒說話了
The baby spoke. My daughter said a word.

511
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,150
我可不能肯定她那是在說話
Your daughter made a sound, Sam. I'm not sure it was a word.

512
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,110
得了吧，那肯定是在說話
Come on, now. It was definitely a word.

513
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,740
你明明聽到她在指著我說「爸爸」
You heard her. The girl sat here, pointed and said, "Pa."

514
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,870
沒錯，她就是說「爸爸」
She did. She said, "Pa."

515
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,170
可她指的是郵筒，山姆
She was pointing at a mailbox, Sam.

516
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,290
沒錯，等於是說：「爸爸，看，郵筒」
That's right, pointing as if to say, "Pa, look. A mailbox."

517
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,930
傑克·羅斯今天找過我 他同意只判十二年
Jack Ross came to see me today. He offered me the 12 years.

518
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,680
正是你想要的不是嗎？ 我知道
Oh, that's what you wanted, right? I know, I know.

519
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,400
我是說，我覺得應該接受，應該接受
I mean, I guess I'll take it. I'll take it.

520
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,530
那麼，只用了四十五秒就說定了
So... It took about 45 seconds.

521
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,280
沒費多大力氣
He barely put up a fight.

522
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,950
丹尼，接受吧，這是份大禮
Danny, take the 12 years. It's a gift.

523
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,910
你不相信他們的供詞對吧？
You don't believe their story, do you?

524
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,160
你覺得他們該在牢裡過下半輩子
You think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives.

525
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,410
我相信他們說的每句話…
I believe every word of their story...

526
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,580
也認為他們該在牢裡過下半輩子
and I think they ought to go to jail for the rest oftheir lives.

527
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,880
明天見 好的
See you tomorrow. Okay.

528
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,630
別忘了穿白色制服，那邊很熱
Don't forget to wear the whites. Very hot down there.

529
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,550
我不喜歡白色制服
I don't like the whites.

530
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,970
沒人喜歡，但我們要去古巴
Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba.

531
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,770
有沒有茶苯海明？ 是用來降溫的嗎？
You got Dramamine? Dramamine keeps you cool?

532
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,400
不，是用來防止嘔吐的 坐飛機會讓你感到不舒服
No, Dramamine keeps you from throwing up. You get sick when you fly.

533
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,860
我不舒服是因為擔心飛機撞到山上
I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain.

534
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,440
恐怕茶苯海明沒什麼用
I don't think Dramaminewill help.

535
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,900
我有些牛至，聽說很管用
I got some oregano. I hear that works pretty good.

536
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,580
羅斯提到的一件怪事讓我改變了想法
You know, Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left.

537
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,080
他說排長喬納森·肯德瑞克上尉…
He said the platoon commander Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

538
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,750
召集手下開會告訴他們別碰聖地亞哥
had a meeting with the men and told them not to touch Santiago.

539
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,170
那麼？
So?

540
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,960
我從沒提過這人，根本不知道他是誰
I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't even know who he is.

541
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,680
管他怎麼回事，明天見
Ah, what the hell. I'll see you tomorrow.

542
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,930
兩位中尉，蓋洛維少校
Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg, Commander Galloway.

543
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,680
我是巴恩斯下士，是來送你們去基地的
I'm Corporal Barnes. I'm to escort you to the windward side of the base.

544
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,930
謝謝 我這有幾件迷彩服
Thank you. I got some camouflage jackets here.

545
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,100
我建議你們都穿上 迷彩服？
I suggest you both put them on. Camouflage jackets?

546
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,310
是的，長官，我們一路上離邊境相當近
Yes, sir. We'll be riding pretty close to the fenceline.

547
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,520
古巴人看到穿白制服的軍官…
The Cubans see an officer wearing white...

548
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,190
有可能認為是重要人物而開槍
they think it might be someone they want to take a shot at.

549
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,490
你出的好主意，山姆
Good call, Sam.

550
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,660
很快就到渡口，要不了多久
We'll just hop on the ferry. We'll be there in no time.

551
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,330
等等，還得坐船嗎？ 是的，長官
Wait. We gotta take a boat? Yes, sir.

552
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:57,040
要到海灣的另一側 沒人提過要坐船
To get to the other side of the bay. Nobody said anything about a boat.

553
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,920
有問題嗎，長官？ 不，沒問題
Is there a problem, sir? No, no problem.

554
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,720
只是討厭坐船而已
Just not crazy about boats.

555
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,100
老天，凱菲 你可是海軍，卻因為坐船而感到害怕
Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy, for crying out loud.

556
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,770
沒人會對坐船太感興趣 是的，長官
Nobody likes her very much. Yes, sir!

557
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,530
我是內森·傑賽普，請進
Nathan Jessup. Come on in.

558
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,620
謝謝，長官，我是丹尼·凱菲 道森和多尼的律師
Thank you, sir. Daniel Kaffee. I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey.

559
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,040
這是喬安妮·蓋洛維少校
This is Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway.

560
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,330
幸會，少校 她負責監督評估，長官
Pleasure meeting you, Commander. Observing and evaluating, sir.

561
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,290
山姆·溫伯格中尉，我的助手
Lieutenant Sam Weinberg. He'll be assisting.

562
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,130
長官 這是我的助手，馬金森中校…
Sir. This is my X.O., Colonel Markinson...

563
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,210
和排長肯德瑞克上尉
and platoon leader Lieutenant Kendrick.

564
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,800
是我讓他們來的，請坐
I've asked them to join us. Sit down, please.

565
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,340
凱菲中尉 馬金森中校
Lieutenant Kaffee. Colonel Markinson.

566
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,930
我曾有幸見過你父親一面
I had the pleasure of meeting your father once.

567
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,020
我當時才十多歲，他到學校去演講
I was a teenager. He spoke at my high school.

568
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,180
萊昂納爾·凱菲？
Lionel Kaffee?

569
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
是的，長官 你們知道嗎？
Yes, sir. Well, what do you know?

570
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,730
約翰，他父親曾在你老家得罪過很多人
John, this man's dad once made a lot of enemies down in your neck of the woods.

571
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,570
傑斐遜和麥迪遜地區學校打官司
Jefferson v. Madison County School District.

572
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,950
當地人反對一個黑人女孩到白人學校上學
Folks down there said a black girl couldn't go to an all-white school.

573
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,950
萊昂納爾·凱菲說 「我們就等著瞧好了」
Lionel Kaffee said, "Well, we'll just see about that."

574
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,620
你父親怎麼樣，丹尼？
How the hell is your dad, Danny?

575
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,080
他七年前去世了，長官
He passed away seven years ago, sir.

576
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,670
千萬別以為我是故意這麼問
Don't I feel like the fucking asshole.

577
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,050
絕對不會
Not at all.

578
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,390
有什麼需要我們效勞的，丹尼？
Well, what can we do for you, Danny?

579
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,390
沒什麼，長官
Uh, not much, sir.

580
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,890
說起來純粹只是例行公事而已
This is really a formality more than anything else.

581
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,810
軍法署署長要求我們面見所有相關證人
JAG Corps insists that we interview all the relevant witnesses.

582
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,820
署長有權這樣要求
The JAG Corps can be demanding that way.

583
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,360
約翰會帶你們去見想見的人
John will take you out and show you what you want to see.

584
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,490
之後我們可以一起吃午飯
After that we can all hook up for lunch.

585
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,820
怎麼樣？ 好的，長官
How does that sound? Good. Fine, sir.

586
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,380
那天下午你召集部下開過會是嗎？
I understand you had a meeting with your men that afternoon.

587
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,750
是的，沒錯 都說了些什麼？
Yes, I did. What did you guys talk about?

588
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,220
我告訴他們我們中間有個告密者…
I told the men that we had an informer among us...

589
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,260
不管大家有多想懲罰他…
and that despite any desire they might have to seek retribution...

590
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,850
總之不得傷害一等兵聖地亞哥
Private Santiago was not to be harmed in anyway.

591
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,230
什麼時候開的會？
16:00 What time was that meeting? 16:00.

592
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:20,140
就是四點
That's 4:00.

593
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,030
山姆，應該找人把這些送交他的父母
Sam, we should make sure somebody gets this to his parents.

594
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,280
我們不再需要這些了 是啊
We don't need it anymore. Right.

595
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,790
肯德瑞克上尉，能叫你約翰嗎？
Lieutenant Kendrick, may I call you John?

596
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,920
不，不行
No, you may not.

597
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,130
我是不是冒犯了你？
Have I done something to offend you?

598
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,290
不，我喜歡你們海軍
No, I like all you Navy boys.

599
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,510
每次我們去什麼地方打仗 你們總會送我們一程
Every time we gotta go someplace to fight, you fellas always give us a ride.

600
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,260
肯德瑞克上尉 你認為聖地亞哥是死於謀殺嗎？
Lieutenant Kendrick, do you think Santiago was murdered?

601
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,220
少校，我信奉主和他的兒子耶穌
Commander, I believe in God and His Son Jesus Christ.

602
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,270
所以我只能說
And because I do, I can say this:

603
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,060
一等兵聖地亞哥死了，這是個悲劇
Private Santiago is dead, and that is a tragedy.

604
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,400
但他的死是因為不守規矩
But he is dead because he had no code.

605
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,860
他的死是因為他對主不敬 而上帝覺察到了
He is dead because he had no honor, and God was watching.

606
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,990
你同意這種觀點嗎？
How do you feel about that theory?

607
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,330
有道理，我們走吧
Sounds good. Let's move on.

608
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,370
你的計劃是來此調查…
Are you planning on doing any investigating...

609
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,370
還是僅僅來旅遊？
or are you just gonna take the guided tour?

610
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,830
我有我的處理方式
I'm pacing myself.

611
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,380
他們來來回回跑了三個鐘頭…
They were running around for three hours...

612
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,420
想找些白色的東西用來當白旗
Iooking for anything white they could wave in the air.

613
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,800
有些人向一個有線新聞網的人投了降
Some of these people surrendered to a crew from CNN.

614
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,220
我總是說，無遮無掩 卻戰勝了一支裝甲部隊
Well, walk softly and carry an armored tank division, I always say.

615
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,810
味道很好，謝謝 是我的榮幸，長官
That was delicious. Thank you. My pleasure, sir.

616
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:31,730
上校，我想問您幾個關於九月六日的問題
Colonel, I do have to ask you a couple of questions about September 6.

617
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,360
儘管問
Shoot.

618
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,070
早上六點，您曾接觸過 一個海軍調查處的官員…
On the morning of the sixth, you were contacted by an N.I.S. Agent...

619
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,570
他說聖地亞哥曾向他透露 一起邊界違規開槍事件
who said that Santiago tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting.

620
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,830
是的 聖地亞哥是以此…
Yes. Santiago would reveal the person...

621
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,700
作為調動的交換條件 是的
in exchange for a transfer. Yes.

622
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,630
如果您覺得我漏掉了什麼細節…
If you feel there are any details that I'm missing...

623
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,960
您可以直接了當地說出來
you should feel free to speak up.

624
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,880
謝謝
Thank you.

625
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:06,680
然後您將馬金森中校 和肯德瑞克上尉叫到了您的辦公室
Now, at this point you called Lieutenant Colonel Markinson... and Lieutenant Kendrick into your office.

626
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,440
是這樣嗎？ 是的
Is that right? Yes.

627
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,650
結果呢？
What happened?

628
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:15,570
我們都同意 為了聖地亞哥的安全應該將他調離基地
We agreed that, for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred off base.

629
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,700
聖地亞哥已被安排調離基地？
Santiago was set to be transferred.

630
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,540
搭乘第二天凌晨六點 第一趟飛往美國的航班
On the first available flight to the States... 0600 the next morning.

631
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,790
從結果來看，五個小時太長了
Five hours too late, as it turned out.

632
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,380
好了，就到這吧，非常感謝各位
All right. That's all I have. Thanks very much for your time.

633
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,760
下士在車上等著，他會送你們回機場
Corporal's waiting with the Jeep. He'll take you back to the flight line.

634
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,800
謝謝，長官 等等，我還有些問題
Thank you, sir. Wait. I've got some questions.

635
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,510
不，別問了 不，我要問
No, you don't. Yes, I do.

636
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,600
不，別問了 聖地亞哥死的那天早上…
No, you don't. On the morning that Santiago died...

637
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,270
三點到五點之間您有沒有見過斯通醫生？
did you meet with Dr. Stone between 3:00 and 5:00?

638
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:53,400
我的一名步下死了，我當然要見醫生
Of course I met with the doctor. One of my men was dead.

639
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,980
懂了吧？人都死了，走吧
See? The man was dead. Let's go.

640
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,780
我想知道您是否聽說過「紅色條規」
I'm just wondering if you've ever heard the term "Code Red."

641
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,740
我聽說過，是的
I've heard the term, yes.

642
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,830
今年二月，您收到過一份警誡備忘錄…
This past February, you received a cautionary memo...

643
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,200
是由大西洋艦隊總司令簽發的…
from the commander-in-chief of the Atlantic fleet...

644
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,460
警告軍官 不得縱容現役軍人私自實施處罰
warning that the practice of enlisted men... disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers.

645
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,050
我得提醒你寫備忘錄的人…
Well, I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo...

646
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,050
絕對不用面對…
has never faced the working end...

647
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,180
古巴人手上的蘇制ＡＫ４７自動步槍
of a Soviet-made Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.

648
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,970
不過，對於總司令的指示…
However, the directive having come from the commander...

649
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,140
我給予了應有的關注
I gave it its due attention.

650
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,810
你的重點是什麼，喬？ 她沒有重點
What is your point, Jo? She has no point.

651
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,770
沒有重點是她迷人之處
She often has no point. It's part of her charm.

652
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:37,860
我們走了，謝謝 我認為這裡仍然存在「紅色條規」
We're out of here. Thank you. I think Code Reds still go on here.

653
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,200
是不是這樣？ 喬，他用不著回答這些
Do Code Reds still happen here? Jo, he doesn't need to answer that.

654
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,820
不，他必須回答 不，他真的不用
Yes, he does. No, he really doesn't.

655
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,950
他必須回答
Yeah, he really does.

656
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,960
真是抓住了我的要害
You know, it just hit me.

657
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
她軍銜比你高吧，丹尼？
She outranks you, Danny.

658
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,880
是的，長官 我要告訴你一件事
Yes, sir. I wanna tell you something.

659
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,470
聽好了，因為我很在意這事
And listen up,'cause I really mean this.

660
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,260
你是世上最幸運的男人
You're the luckiest man in the world.

661
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,640
相信我，各位…世上沒有什麼事情
There is nothing on this earth sexier... believe me, gentlemen...

662
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,730
比你一大早就得給一個女人敬禮更性感
than a woman that you have to salute in the morning.

663
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,690
把她們全都提升，因為事實上
Promote them all, I say,'cause this is true:

664
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,900
如果沒有上級軍官為你口交…
If you haven't gotten a blow job from a superior officer...

665
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,530
那你就錯過了生活中最美妙的東西
well, you're just letting the best in life pass you by.

666
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,280
上校，「紅色條規」仍被軍官
Colonel, the practice of Code Reds is still condoned by officers...

667
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,790
我的問題在於我是個上校 所以我得去洗個冷水澡…
My problem is that I'm a colonel, so I'll go on taking cold showers...

668
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,410
直到選出一位女總統
until they elect some gal president.

669
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,960
我要你回答我的問題，長官
I need an answer to my question, sir.

670
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,590
注意你的語氣，少校
Take caution in your tone, Commander.

671
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,130
我是個平和的人 但這該死的高溫讓我完全失去了理智
I'm a fair guy, but this fucking heat is making me absolutely crazy.

672
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,220
你問「紅色條規」？在檔案上…
You wanna ask me about Code Reds? On the record...

673
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,270
我是禁止實施的…
I tell you I discourage the practice...

674
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,390
和總司令的指示一致
in accordance with the commander's directive.

675
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,520
但撇開檔案，告訴你 是軍團內部訓練很重要的一部分
Off the record, I tell you it is an invaluable part... of close-infantry training.

676
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,530
只要事情不是發生在我眼皮底下 就順其自然
And if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it.

677
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,650
我以我的方式來管理我的部下
I run my unit how I run my unit.

678
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,160
你想調查我 儘管看看你有多大的機會好了
You wanna investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances.

679
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,710
我吃早餐時三百碼外 有四千名訓練有素的古巴人想幹掉我
I eat breakfast 300 yards from 4,000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

680
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,880
所以別以為你可以跑到這來…
So don't think for one second that you can come down here...

681
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,040
耀武揚威…
flash a badge...

682
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,710
嚇唬我
and make me nervous.

683
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,090
我們走吧
Let's go.

684
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:35,770
上校，我需要一份聖地亞哥調令的複印件
Colonel, I'll just need a copy of Santiago's transfer order.

685
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,350
什麼？
What's that?

686
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,610
聖地亞哥的調令，你們應該有這一類檔案
Santiago's transfer order. You guys have paperwork on that kind of thing.

687
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,610
我需要一份存檔
I just need it for the file.

688
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,690
存檔 是的
For the file. Yeah.

689
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:52,160
你當然可以複印一份調令用來存檔
Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order for the file.

690
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,490
我會盡力協助你們 謝謝
I'm here to help in anyway I can. Thank you.

691
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,670
你相不相信我會盡我所能協助你？
You believe that, don't you, Danny, that I'm here to help you in anyway I can?

692
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,880
當然
Of course.

693
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:06,130
去機場時下士會送你們去人事部門…
Corporal will take you by personnel on your way out to the flight line...

694
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,510
你可以複印你想要的所有調令
and you can have all the transfer orders that you want.

695
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,760
走吧 但你們得對我客氣點
Let's go. But you have to ask me nicely.

696
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,310
什麼？
I beg your pardon?

697
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:21,560
你得對我客氣點
You have to ask me nicely.

698
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,020
知道嗎，丹尼，槍林彈雨流血我都能應付
You see, Danny, I can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood.

699
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,280
我不需要金錢，不需要獎章
I don't want money, and I don't want medals.

700
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,030
我要的是穿著娘娘腔的白色制服 的你站在那…
What I do want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform...

701
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,620
用你那哈佛練出來的嘴 給我一點該死的尊重
and with your Harvard mouth extend me some fucking courtesy.

702
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,750
你得對我客氣點
You gotta ask me nicely.

703
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,590
傑賽普上校，如果不太麻煩的話…
Colonel Jessup, if it's not too much trouble...

704
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:52,630
我想要一份調令的複印件，長官
I'd like a copy of the transfer order, sir.

705
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,310
沒問題
No problem.

706
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,680
第七局，「聖地亞哥」領先 「勇士」試圖扳平
In the seventh. San Diego leads. Braves try to come back.

707
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,010
跑壘員別急
Runners don't go.

708
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,850
有力的一擊，右外野手，好戲上演了
Hard drive, right field. We're gonna have a tied ball game.

709
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,890
成功了，現在的比分是十比十
It's on its way, and it is now 10 to 10.

710
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,900
真是難以置信
And I don't believe it.

711
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,280
誰？ 是我
Who is it? It's me.

712
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,240
我真想你 我在這自言自語都快三個鐘頭了
I really missed you. I was just saying to myself it's been almost three hours.

713
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,160
馬金森失蹤了 什麼？
Markinson's disappeared. What?

714
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,000
馬金森中校擅離職守
Colonel Markinson's gone U. A... unauthorized absence.

715
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,540
知道了，什麼時候？
I know what it means. When?

716
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,880
今天下午，我們離開之後
This afternoon. Sometime after we left.

717
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,250
我明早去找他 我找過了
I'll try to find him in the morning. I've already tried.

718
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,050
找過了？
You tried?

719
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,760
喬安，你幾乎夠得上教科書上定義的…
Joanne, you're coming dangerously close to the textbook definition...

720
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,100
妨礙政府調查的罪名了
of interfering with a government investigation.

721
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,720
我是勞登·多尼的律師
I'm Louden Downey's attorney.

722
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,600
詹妮姨媽說她似乎已和我相交多年
Aunt Ginny. She says she feels like she's known me for years.

723
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,190
所以我建議由我直接介入本案 可以顯得更親近
So I suggested that she might feel more comfortable... if I were directly involved with the case.

724
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,650
一小時前她得到了勞登的簽名同意
She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago.

725
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,700
我想你對此期望過高了…
I suppose it's way too much to hope...

726
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,240
你討好她就會妨礙我
that you're making this up just to bother me.

727
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,450
別擔心，我並不想自作主張
Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a motion for separation.

728
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,410
你還是首席辯護 好極了
You're still lead counsel. Splendid.

729
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,330
我猜你也同意 是肯德瑞克授意的「紅色條規」
I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red, and so do you.

730
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,090
我們走吧
Let's go.

731
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,720
長官到，立正
Officer on deck!

732
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,720
是肯德瑞克的命令嗎？ 長官？
Did Kendrick order the Code Red? Sir?

733
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,510
別好像我在問你是否打掃過廁所似的
Don't say "Sir" like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine.

734
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,810
是不是上尉命令你們…
You heard what I said. Did Lieutenant Kendrick order you guys...

735
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,890
對聖地亞哥實施「紅色條規」？
to give Santiago a Code Red?

736
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,270
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

737
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,110
是他嗎？ 是的，長官
Did he? Yes, sir.

738
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,160
介不介意說說為什麼以前不告訴我？
You mind telling me why you never mentioned this before?

739
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,290
你沒問過 這可不會讓我對你有什麼好印象
You didn't ask. That won't win you a place in my heart.

740
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,660
你在牢裡蹲多久我照樣拿薪水
I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail.

741
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,750
是的，長官，我知道，長官
Yes, sir. I know you do, sir.

742
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,000
去你的，哈羅德 好了
Fuck you, Harold! All right.

743
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,550
冷靜點
At ease.

744
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,510
我們來說說清楚 活見鬼
Let's sort this thing out. Shit!

745
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:32,050
九月六日下午四點排裡開過一個會
There was a platoon meeting on September 6 at 4:00 in the afternoon.

746
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,470
肯德瑞克上尉說他嚴令…
Lieutenant Kendrick says that he gave strict instructions...

747
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:36,640
不許碰聖地亞哥
that nothing was to happen to Santiago.

748
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,810
是真的嗎？
Now, is this true?

749
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,440
你們要實話實話
I want you to speak freely.

750
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,900
夫人，是真的…
Ma'am, that's correct...

751
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,690
但之後我們就解散各自回房了
but then he dismissed the platoon and we all went to our rooms.

752
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,070
後來怎麼樣？
And what happened then?

753
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,820
肯德瑞克上尉去了我們的房間
Lieutenant Kendrick came to our room, ma'am.

754
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,910
幾點？
When?

755
00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:00,660
大約散會五分鐘之後 長官，四點二十左右
About five minutes after the meeting broke, sir. About 1620.

756
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,330
然後呢？
And what happened then?

757
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,790
肯德瑞克上尉命令我們 對聖地亞哥執行「紅色條規」
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red.

758
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,130
傑克
Jack!

759
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,470
等等
Hang on.

760
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,050
他們是奉命行事
They were given an order.

761
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,140
傑克，過來 馬上回來
Jack, come on. Be right back.

762
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,430
你幹什麼，傑克？ 就回來
What are you doing, Jack? Be right back.

763
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,650
你知道這命令多久了？ 我不知道，這位是？
How long did you know about the order? I didn't. Who's this?

764
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:29,400
喬·蓋洛維，多尼的律師 她很高興認識你
That's Jo Galloway, Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you.

765
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,650
你想指責我什麼？ 你知道這個命令多久了？
What exactly are you accusing me of? How long did you know about the order?

766
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,570
他不知道，如果知道卻對我們隱瞞 就違反了職業守則第十四條
He didn't,'cause if he did and hadn't told us... he'd be violating about 14 articles of the Code of Ethics.

767
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,030
他就得擔心…
He has enough to worry about...

768
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,240
當事人申請無罪…
God forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty...

769
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,540
並為他們是奉命行事作證
and testify for the record that they were given an order.

770
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,250
肯德瑞克曾明令部下不許碰聖地亞哥
Kendrick specifically told those men not to touch Santiago.

771
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,170
沒錯，然後他找了道森和多尼…
That's right. And then he went into Dawson and Downey's room...

772
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,250
明令他們執行「紅色條規」
and specifically told them to give him a Code Red.

773
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,050
可他說…他在說謊 有證據嗎？ 有被告作證
Kendrick said different. Have proof? He's lying. I have the defendants.

774
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,260
可我有二十三名 未被指控謀殺的陸戰隊員…
And I have 23 Marines who aren't accused of murder...

775
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,640
和一名受過四次嘉獎的上尉
and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation.

776
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,890
馬金森為何擅離職守？ 無從查究
Why did Markinson go U. A? We'll never know.

777
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,970
你以為我不能傳訊他嗎？ 你能找到他再說
You don't think I could subpoena him? You can try, but you won't find him.

778
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,900
知道他二十六年軍旅生涯的前十七年 是幹什麼嗎？
You know what he did for the first 17 of his 26 years in the Corps?

779
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,520
反諜報工作，他消失了 再沒有什麼馬金森了
Counterintelligence. Markinson's gone. There is no Markinson.

780
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,860
你看，丹尼
Look, Danny.

781
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,490
傑賽普很快就會提升
Jessup's star is on the rise.

782
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,490
師部會給我很大的餘地…
Division will give me a lot of room on this one...

783
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,740
使他和部隊免於難堪
to spare Jessup and the Corps any embarrassment.

784
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,950
多大的餘地？
How much?

785
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,750
過失殺人，兩年刑期 他們六個月後就能回家
Involuntary manslaughter, two years, they're home in six months.

786
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,250
沒得商量，我們要上庭
No deal. We're going to court.

787
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,130
你們不會 為什麼？
No, you're not. Why not?

788
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,550
因為你會輸，丹尼明白這一點
'Cause you'll lose, and Danny knows it.

789
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,340
如果上了法庭我就要追查到底
If we do go to court, I'm gonna have to go all the way.

790
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,760
他們就得承擔所有罪名…
They're gonna be charged with a whole truckload...

791
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,430
謀殺，共謀，行為不當
murder, conspiracy, conduct unbecoming.

792
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,890
在球場上他能贏我，可他知道…
Even though he's got me by the balls out here, Danny knows...

793
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,270
上了法庭他準會輸
that in a courtroom, he loses this case.

794
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,270
丹尼是個天才橫溢的律師
Danny is an awfully talented lawyer.

795
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,770
既然知道當事人六個月就能回家…
He's not about to see his clients go to jail for life...

796
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,360
就不會讓他們蹲一輩子監獄
when he knows they can be home in six months.

797
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,990
協商到此為止
That's the end of this negotiation.

798
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,280
明早傳訊時見
I'll see you tomorrow morning at the arraignment.

799
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,580
好了，情況是這樣
All right. Here's the story.

800
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:11,330
政府提出以過失殺人罪判處兩年刑期
The government's offering involuntary manslaughter, two years.

801
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,340
六個月後就能回家
Be home in six months.

802
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,630
哇，凱菲，你是世上最了不起的律師
Wow, Kaffee! You're the greatest lawyer in the world!

803
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,760
我們該怎麼謝你呢？
Ooh, how can we ever thank you?

804
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,390
夥計們，你們聽到我說什麼了吧？
Fellas, you hear what I just said?

805
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,730
你們六個月後就能自由
You're going home in six months.

806
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,150
我恐怕不能接受，長官
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

807
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,570
接受什麼？ 協商解決，長官
Do what? Make a deal, sir.

808
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,030
你說什麼？
What are you talking about?

809
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,990
我們沒做錯什麼，長官 我們只是恪守本份…
We did nothing wrong, sir. We did our job...

810
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:42,240
如果要因此而我會承受的
and if that has consequences, then I'll accept them.

811
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,700
但我不會承認有罪，長官
But I won't say that I'm guilty, sir.

812
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:49,580
是你…是不是她讓你們這麼說的？
Did you... Did she put you up to this?

813
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,170
這是我們的準則，長官 哦，令人激動
We have a code, sir. Oh, well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!

814
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:56,590
你依你的準則申請無罪 就得在牢裡過下半輩子
You and your code plead not guilty. You'll be in jail the rest of your life.

815
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,720
照我說的做六個月後就能回家
Do what I'm telling you, you'll be home in six months.

816
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,510
接受吧，哈羅德，六個月
Do it, Harold. Six months.

817
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,100
算不了什麼，一個冰球賽季而已
It's nothing. It's a hockey season.

818
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,270
請允許我… 說吧
Permission to... Speak!

819
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,440
老天
Jesus!

820
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,860
我們以後怎麼辦，長官？ 什麼以後？
What do we do then, sir? When?

821
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,990
六個月後，會被不榮譽解職是吧？長官
After six months, we'll be dishonorably discharged, right, sir?

822
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,320
有可能
Probably.

823
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,570
那時我們怎麼辦，長官？
Well, what do we do then, sir?

824
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,210
我們入伍是為了按一種明確的法規來生活
We joined the Marines because we wanted to live our lives by a certain code.

825
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,000
我們在部隊感受到了
And we found it in the Corps.

826
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,340
現在你卻要我們簽字承認自己是不光彩的
Now you're asking us to sign a piece of paper that says we have no honor.

827
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,590
要我們承認不是陸戰隊員
You're asking us to say we're not Marines.

828
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,970
如果法庭判決我們犯了錯…
If a court decides that what we did was wrong...

829
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,050
不管什麼處罰我都接受
then I'll accept whatever punishment they give.

830
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:47,640
但我相信沒做錯，長官 我只是履行了自己的職責…
But I believe I was right, sir. I believe I did my job...

831
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,020
我不會為了六個月後能回家…
and I will not dishonor myself, my unit or the Corps...

832
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,190
而讓自己，自己的單位和部隊蒙羞…
so that I can go home in six months...

833
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:56,650
長官
sir.

834
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,780
少校，請讓我和道森下士 單獨聊一會行嗎？
Commander, I'd like to talk to Lance Corporal Dawson alone for a minute.

835
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,120
中士
Sergeant.

836
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,710
我們去其他房間
We're gonna go to another room.

837
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,130
我們要去其他監禁室 好的，夫人
We'd like another holding room. All right, ma'am.

838
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,630
不會有問題 坐吧
It's gonna be okay. Sit down.

839
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,100
你很討厭我是不是？
You don't like me very much, do you?

840
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,650
算了，不必回答，沒關係
Forget it. Don't answer that. It doesn't matter.

841
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,240
知道嗎…
You know...

842
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,530
多尼很尊敬你
Downey worships you.

843
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,830
你怎麼做他就會怎麼做
He's gonna do whatever you do.

844
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,580
你真的願意因為一條準則 而讓他受一輩子牢獄之災嗎，哈羅德？
Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code, Harold?

845
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,090
你覺得我們有錯嗎？ 問題不在這…
Do you think we were right? It doesn't matter...

846
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:06,300
你覺得我們有沒有錯？ 我覺得你們會輸
Do you think we were right? I think you'd lose.

847
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,090
你是個懦夫
You're such a coward.

848
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,760
真不明白怎麼會讓你穿上軍裝
I can't believe they let you wear a uniform.

849
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,770
我的責任到此為止，我已經盡了力
I'm not gonna feel responsible for this. I did everything I could.

850
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,350
你去監獄過你的美好生活好了
You're going to Leavenworth for the better part of your life.

851
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,360
和我沒半點關係
And you know what? I don't give a shit.

852
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,450
長官離開房間時你怎麼不敬禮？
What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?

853
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,540
開門
Open it up.

854
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,330
真不敢相信，真不敢相信
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

855
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,930
就因為恨我他寧可去監獄
Dawson's gonna go to jail just to spite me.

856
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,560
沒問題，他想自尋死路是他的事
Fine. If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business.

857
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,390
我可不想陪他去送死 怎樣才能給他另找個律師？
I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way. I wanna get him a new lawyer. How?

858
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,900
明早傳訊時提出申請就是
Just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment.

859
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,940
法官會問你是否要提出答辯…
The judge will ask you if you want to enter a plea...

860
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,440
你就說希望另行指派律師
and you tell him that you want to have new counsel assigned.

861
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,360
就這樣吧
That's that.

862
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,780
還有，當你要求法官另找律師時…
One thing, though. When you ask the judge for new counsel...

863
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,740
丹尼，記住一定要客氣點
Danny, be sure and ask nicely.

864
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,500
你想要我怎麼做？ 要你讓他們接受庭審
What doyou want from me? I want you to let them be judged.

865
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,460
要你站起來進行辯護
I want you to stand up and make an argument.

866
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,210
辯護對屠殺越南人的戰犯沒用
An argument that didn't work for Calley at My Lai.

867
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,380
對紐倫堡的納粹分子也沒用
An argument that didn't work for the Nazis at Nuremburg.

868
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,380
看在上帝份上，山姆
Oh, for Christ's sake, Sam.

869
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,880
你真認為這是一碼事嗎？
Do you really think that's the same as two teenage Marines...

870
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,760
他們從不懷疑執行命令有什麼錯
executing a routine order they never believed would result in harm?

871
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,510
他們可不是納粹分子
These guys aren't the Nazis.

872
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,680
現在爭沒用，丹尼，除非你上庭辯護
Don't look now, Danny, but you're making an argument.

873
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,810
是啊，是啊，明早我就給他們找個新律師
Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning I get them a new attorney.

874
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,810
你幹嘛這樣害怕做律師？
Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer?

875
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,400
是你父親的期望太高了嗎？
Were Daddy's expectations really that high?

876
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,070
得了，別跟我來這套父父子子的激將法
Oh, please. Spare me the psycho-babble father bullshit!

877
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,530
他們會有滿意的結果，不過要靠別的律師
Dawson and Downey will have their day in court, but with another lawyer.

878
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,580
別的律師不夠好，他們需要你
Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you.

879
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,210
你知道怎麼贏 你知道他們有冤情，你知道怎麼才能贏
You know how to win. You know they have a case, and you know how to win.

880
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,710
你一走了之等於決定了他們的命運
If you walk away from this now, you've sealed their fate.

881
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,130
聖地亞哥身亡之時 他們的命運就已經注定了
Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died.

882
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:04,970
你相信他們有冤情嗎？ 你和道森都活在夢想世界裡
Do you believe they have a case? You and Dawson. You both live in the same dream world.

883
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,970
問題不在於我相信什麼
It doesn't matter what I believe.

884
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,180
而在於我能證明什麼
It only matters what I can prove.

885
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,180
所以別說我知道什麼不知道什麼
So, please, don't tell me what I know and don't know!

886
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,980
我只知道法律
I know the law!

887
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,900
你對法律一無所知
You know nothing about the law.

888
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,190
你是個二手車推銷員，丹尼
You're a used car salesman, Daniel.

889
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,780
你做律師只配處理交通糾紛
You're an ambulance chaser with a rank.

890
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,950
一無是處是你的謀生之道
You're nothing. Live with that.

891
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,370
所以我告訴鄧肯…
So I told Duncan...

892
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,670
如果你想上庭，我會申請要求取證…
"If you wanna take this to court I'm gonna file nine discovery motions...

893
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:48,590
你就得因為一個九旬老翁看錯特拉華州 的保險條款花上一年時間來組織書面材料
and you're gonna spend a year going blind on paperwork... because a 90-year-old man misread the Delaware insurance code."

894
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,850
然後呢？ 十五分鐘後他回了電話
So what happened? He calls back 15 minutes later.

895
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,850
他說「庭外和解好了」
He says, "Let's make a deal."

896
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,440
全體起立
All rise.

897
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,030
哪個案子？
Where are we?

898
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,330
訴訟號 411275VR-5 一案
Docket number 411275VR-5.

899
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,450
美國政府起訴哈羅德·道森准下士…
The United States v. Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson...

900
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,500
和一等兵勞登·多尼
and Private First Class Louden Downey.

901
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,750
罪名為謀殺，同謀策劃謀殺…
The accused are charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder...

902
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,380
以及對一名陸戰隊員行為不當
and conduct unbecoming a United States Marine.

903
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,630
辯方有什麼意見嗎？
Does the defense wish to enter a plea?

904
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,800
是的
Yeah.

905
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:16,930
他們沒有罪
They're not guilty.

906
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,730
提請進行無罪答辯
Enter a plea of not guilty for the accused.

907
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:26,060
現在宣佈休庭，三周後上午十點…
We'll adjourn until 1000, three weeks from today...

908
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,110
在最高軍事法庭重新開庭審理
at which time this general court-martial will reconvene.

909
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,130
為什麼一名只有九個月經驗 和資歷的中尉…
Why does a lieutenant junior grade with ninth months'experience...

910
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,590
會被指派為一起謀殺案作辯護律師？
and a track record for plea bargaining get assigned a murder case?

911
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,430
難道這樣就能避免對簿公堂嗎？
Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom?

912
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,930
晚上七點到我家找找答案
We'll work out of my apartment every night, 7:00.

913
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:07,650
喬，記住帶一盒便箋 六盒紅筆和六盒黑筆
Jo, pick up a carton of legal pads, half a dozen boxes of red and black pens.

914
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,940
山姆，帶幾盞檯燈來 準備一份初步的驗屍報告
Sam, get a couple of desk lamps. I need a preliminary medical profile.

915
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:15,450
喬，把道森，多尼和聖地亞哥 所有的訓練審核報告找來
Jo, we need all proficiency and conduct reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago.

916
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:17,700
我只有可可飲料和汽水…
The only thing I have to eat is Yoo-hoo and Cocoa Puffs...

917
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,700
想要其他飲料自己帶
so if you want anything else, bring it with you.

918
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,950
行嗎？ 好的
Okay? Yeah.

919
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,460
原來法庭就是這個樣子
So this is what a courtroom looks like.

920
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,470
你和海軍調查處的朋友說過嗎？
Were you able to speak to your friend at the N.I. S?

921
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,810
說過，她說如果馬金森不想被找到…
Yeah. She said if Markinson doesn't want to be found...

922
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,730
我們就別想找到他
we're not gonna find him.

923
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:52,780
哪怕馬金森就在你面前你也認不出
She said I could be Markinson, and you wouldn't know it.

924
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,400
你是馬金森嗎？
Are you Markinson?

925
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,570
不是，我也不是馬金森
I'm not Markinson.

926
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,830
那你我都排除在外了
That's two down.

927
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:06,790
怎麼了？
What?

928
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,340
我想知道，現在有喬安妮幫忙…
I'm just wondering, now that Joanne's on this...

929
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,920
你是不是還需要我
I'm just wondering if you still need me.

930
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,800
他們只是執行命令 是不合法的命令
They were following orders. An illegal order.

931
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,090
你認為他們知道這命令不合法嗎？
Do you think they knew it was an illegal order?

932
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,510
問題在於凡是正直的人都會拒絕…
It doesn't matter what they knew. Any decent person would have refused...

933
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,850
他們無權懷疑上級的命令
They're not permitted to question orders.

934
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,940
那幹嘛要偷偷摸摸？幹嘛要用代碼？
Then what's the secret? Huh? What are the magic words?

935
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,560
我每天都下命令…
I give orders every day...

936
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,610
我們有棒球比賽和軍樂隊
We have softball games and marching bands.

937
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:36,940
可他們呆的地方得穿迷彩服 不然就可能被當成靶子
They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot!

938
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,660
我需要你
I need you.

939
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,790
做調查你比我強 而且你知道怎樣安排證人
You're better at research than I am, and you know how to prepare a witness.

940
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,260
我帶來了驗屍報告，還有中餐，先吃點吧
I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first.

941
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,770
怎麼了？
What?

942
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,940
有沒有宮保雞丁？
You got any kung pao chicken?

943
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,870
我們要強調的是… 沒人能證明那塊抹布下過毒
This is our defense... intent. No one can prove there was poison on the rag.

944
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:22,790
「紅色條規」在關達那摩灣見怪不怪
Code Red... they're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay.

945
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:27,250
而命令…Ａ：是肯德瑞克下的 Ｂ：他們必須服從
The order... A: Kendrick gave it, B: They had to follow it.

946
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,420
就這些 動機呢？
That's it. What about motive?

947
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,500
這一點我們處於下風
We're a little weak on motive. They had one.

948
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,760
這並不表示他們有罪 別激動
That doesn't mean they're guilty. Relax.

949
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,220
我們會應付好開槍事件
We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up.

950
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,430
開始吧，別管聖地亞哥的具體死因…
Let's start with intent. I don't want to know what made Santiago die.

951
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:42,430
只需要證明有可能是毒藥之外的因素
I just want to show it could've been something other than poison.

952
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:46,100
喬，找醫生瞭解和乳酸中毒有關的一切
Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis.

953
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,440
我是華盛頓最高軍法處的蓋洛維少校
This is Lieutenant Commander Galloway with the JAG Corps in Washington.

954
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,780
我想找出馬修·馬金森中校的下落
I've been trying to track down a Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

955
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,650
醫生，有沒有任何外傷？
Doctor, was there any sign of external damage?

956
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:00,240
沒有擦傷？沒有傷口？淤傷和骨折呢？
No scrapes? No cuts? Bruises? Broken bones?

957
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,660
有沒有暴力痕跡？ 難道死亡還不足以證明嗎？
Was there any sign of violence? You mean, other than the dead body?

958
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,500
見鬼，我忽略了該死的時間問題
Shit, I walk into that every goddamn time.

959
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,210
他命令我和道森准下士 對威廉執行「紅色條規」
He ordered me and Lance Corporal Dawson to give Willie a Code Red.

960
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,510
回答還得更快一些
Answers still have to come much faster.

961
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:19,140
馬馬虎虎，但最後一句 聽起來感覺像在編造事實
This Iowa farm boy thing will play for a while... but in the end, it sounds like he's searching for the truth.

962
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,470
沒錯，要說「一等兵聖地亞哥」
He's right. From now on, Willie is Private Santiago.

963
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:26,180
別說「威廉」，那會讓陪審團產生 對我們不利的情緒，懂嗎？
You start calling him Willie, and all of a sudden he's a person... who's got a mother who's gonna miss him, okay?

964
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,190
下午已經擬定了陪審團
They drew the court members this afternoon.

965
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,560
七男兩女，五個海軍，四個陸戰隊員
Seven men, two women, five Navy, four Marines.

966
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,150
全是資深軍官，兩個女的都有孩子
All officers with line experience. Neither of the women have children.

967
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,530
不太妙，我們對此無能為力
That's a bad break. There's nothing we can do.

968
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:38,360
有陪審團就不單純是法律的問題了
My father always said a jury trial is not just about the law.

969
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,620
而聖地亞哥的無辜身亡會讓…
It's about assigning blame. Santiago's dead, and he shouldn't be.

970
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:44,540
陪審團主張有人得為此承擔罪責
These nine people are gonna insist that someone be blamed for that.

971
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,080
是當事人還是肯德瑞克…
Ross is handing them our clients. We're gonna hand them Kendrick.

972
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,710
就得看律師如何「推銷」自己的觀點了
This is about a sales pitch. It's gonna be won by the lawyers.

973
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:54,050
記住表情要嚴肅，在陪審團面前不要畏縮
So remember, poker faces. Don't flinch in front of the court members.

974
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:57,880
態度要強硬，別低著頭如坐針氈
Something doesn't go our way, don't hang your head or shift in your seat.

975
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,720
不管出現什麼意外都要讓人感覺成竹在胸
Whatever happens, you have to look like it's exactly what you knew would happen.

976
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,390
遞文件給我時… 動作要迅速而從容
If you pass me documents... Do it swiftly and don't look eager.

977
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,600
上庭時別打香水，那會分散我的注意力
Don't wear that perfume in court. Wrecks my concentration.

978
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,060
真的嗎？
Really?

979
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,520
我是說山姆
I was talking to Sam.

980
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,230
幾點了？
What time is it?

981
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,320
該回家了，好好睡一覺
It's time to go home. Try to get some sleep.

982
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,450
能送我一程嗎？
Yeah. Give me a ride?

983
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,910
沒問題
Sure.

984
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:27,080
你真是個好人，查理布朗（卡通人物）
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

985
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,660
法庭上見，大律師
I'll seeyou in court, counselor.

986
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,590
丹尼，我… 不用說了
Danny, I... You don't have to say it.

987
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:41,050
我們有過分歧，我說過一些無心的話
We've had our differences. I said some things I didn't mean.

988
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:44,510
你也是，但你很高興我能接下這個案子
You said some things you didn't mean, but you're happy I stuck with the case.

989
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:48,980
如果過去三周以來 你對我多了一些敬意…
And if you've gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks...

990
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,100
我當然會為此而高興
of course, I'm happy about that.

991
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,270
但用不著太放在心上
But we don't have to make a whole big deal out of it.

992
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:55,610
你喜歡我我也不會要求你說出來
If you like me, I won't make you say it.

993
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:59,150
我只是想提醒你明天別穿錯襪子
I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow.

994
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:04,370
好的，很重要提示
Okay. Good tip.

995
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,370
那就萬事俱備了
We're ready.

996
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,910
最好相信這一點
Better believe it.

997
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,760
我們要大獲全勝
We're gonna get creamed.

998
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,370
凱菲中尉？ 什麼事？
Lieutenant Kaffee? Yes?

999
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,790
你會救我們的兒子對吧？
You are gonna save our son, aren't you?

1000
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,170
我會盡力而為
I'll do my best.

1001
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,760
丹尼，我給你介紹一下 勞登的姨媽詹妮·米勒
Danny, I'd like you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt.

1002
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,640
你就是詹妮姨媽？
You're Aunt Ginny? Uh-huh.

1003
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,020
不好意思，沒想到你這麼年輕
I'm sorry. I was expecting someone older.

1004
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,770
彼此彼此
So was I.

1005
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,900
給個機會擲硬幣定輸贏吧
Last chance. I'll flip you for it.

1006
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,400
全體起立 太晚了
All rise. Too late.

1007
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:33,080
最高軍事法庭，請所有在場人員…
All those having business with this general court-martial...

1008
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,710
坐到前面來，主持審判的是…
stand forward and you shall be heard.

1009
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,250
朱利葉斯·亞歷山大·倫道夫將軍
Colonel Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding.

1010
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,880
控方準備好作公開陳述了嗎？
Is the government prepared to make an opening statement?

1011
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,340
是的，大人
Yes, sir.

1012
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:48,760
本案事實如下：
The facts of the case are these:

1013
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,640
九月六日午夜，被告潛入其隊友…
On midnight of September 6, the accused entered the barracks room...

1014
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,680
一等兵威廉·聖地亞哥的房間
of their platoon mate, P.F.C. William Santiago.

1015
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,850
將其弄醒後捆住其手腳…
They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with tape...

1016
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:00,150
並強行將一塊抹布塞進他的喉嚨
and forced a rag into his throat.

1017
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,860
幾分鐘後 一種名為「乳酸中毒」的化學反應…
A few minutes later, a chemical reaction called lactic acidosis...

1018
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,030
導致其肺部出血…
caused his lungs to begin bleeding.

1019
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:08,030
因此而窒息…
He drowned in his own blood...

1020
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:11,740
至午夜十二點三十七分被確認死亡
and was pronounced dead at 37 minutes past midnight.

1021
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:16,870
以上為本案事實經過，絕無虛假
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.

1022
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:20,540
各位將會聽到被告道森准下士…
That's right. The story I've just told you...

1023
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:24,210
以及一等兵多尼的陳述…
is the exact same story you're gonna hear from Lance Corporal Dawson...

1024
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:27,010
與我剛才所說的完全一致
and it's the exact same story you're gonna hear from Private Downey.

1025
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:29,760
此外，我將向各位證實…
Furthermore, the government will also demonstrate...

1026
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,260
被告在抹布上下過毒…
that the accused soaked the rag in poison...

1027
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,520
而且是懷著殺人動機潛入聖地亞哥的房間
and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.

1028
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,850
現在，凱菲中尉…
Now, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1029
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,070
會努力玩弄一些小魔術來混淆視聽
is gonna try and pull off a little magic act here.

1030
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,610
他會用令人震驚的所謂「軍規」…
He's gonna try a little misdirection.

1031
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:49,410
某些聽起來很正式的術語…
He's gonna astonish you with stories of rituals...

1032
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:52,410
試著誤導在場的各位…
and dazzle you with official-sounding terms...

1033
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,370
例如「紅色條規」
like "Code Red."

1034
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,790
甚至還有可能牽扯上幾位軍官
He might even try to cut into a few officers for you.

1035
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:03,750
他沒有證據，一點證據都沒有 不過會很有娛樂性
He'll have no evidence, mind you, none, but it's gonna be entertaining.

1036
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:07,300
但是最終，世上所有的魔術…
And when we get to the end, all the magic in the world...

1037
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,090
都無法讓人忽視一個事實…
will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact...

1038
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:15,770
威廉·聖地亞哥死了 是道森和多尼殺死了他
that Willie Santiago is dead and Dawson and Downey killed him.

1039
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,730
這是本案的事實，是無法否認的
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.

1040
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,070
凱菲中尉
Lieutenant Kaffee.

1041
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:27,070
抹布沒下過毒，而且沒有殺人動機
There was no poison on the rag, and there was no intent to kill.

1042
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:31,860
不管用什麼方式去證明都是徒勞的 因為這不是事實
Any attempt to prove otherwise is futile'cause it just aingt true.

1043
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:35,160
那天夜裡道森和多尼 進入聖地亞哥的房間…
When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night...

1044
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,830
不是因為報復或敵意
it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred.

1045
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,620
不是為了殺人或傷人，也不是為了尋開心
It wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks.

1046
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,420
因為他們是奉命行事
It's because it was what they were ordered to do.

1047
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,210
讓我重複一次
Let me say that again.

1048
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,430
因為他們是奉命行事
It's because it was what theywere ordered to do.

1049
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,010
在其他地方這無足輕重…
Out in the real world that means nothing...

1050
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:57,310
哪怕在這…海軍學院也沒什麼大不了
and here at the Washington Navy Yard it doesn't mean a whole lot more.

1051
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:01,350
但如果一名 古巴關達那摩灣Ｗ步兵警衛連的…
But if you're a Marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward...

1052
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:04,360
海軍陸戰隊員接到一個命令…
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order...

1053
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,980
不執行就得捲鋪蓋走人
you follow it or you packyour bags.

1054
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,070
這一點不要弄錯
Make no mistake about it.

1055
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:12,410
哈·道森和勞·多尼今天坐在各位面前…
Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you today...

1056
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:15,870
是因為他們履行了自己的職責
because they did their job.

1057
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:21,660
控方要傳訊第一個證人嗎？
Is the government ready to call its first witness?

1058
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:26,420
庭上，控方請求傳召Ｒ·Ｃ·米蓋爾先生
If it please the court, the government calls Mr. R.C. McGuire.

1059
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,010
米蓋爾先生，請舉起你的右手
Mr. McGuire, would you raise your right hand, please?

1060
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:35,850
你願意發誓你在法庭上…
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give this general court-martial...

1061
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:38,850
所說的一切完全屬實，絕無虛假嗎？
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1062
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:42,270
我發誓 請坐下，先生
I do. Have a seat, please, sir.

1063
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:45,690
請說出你的全名以及職業
Would you state your full name and occupation, for the record?

1064
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:50,190
羅伯特·Ｃ·米蓋爾 海軍調查處特別官員
Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent, Naval Investigative Service.

1065
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:54,570
米蓋爾先生，今年九月三日 你的辦公室是否收到過一等兵…
Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter from P.F.C. William Santiago...

1066
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:56,780
威廉·聖地亞哥的信？
on 3 September of this year?

1067
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,160
是的 信裡面說什麼？
We did. What did that letter say?

1068
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:03,870
是說他所在單位的一名隊員 用所持武器在邊界向境外開槍
That a member of Santiago's unit had fired his weapon over the fenceline.

1069
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:06,080
有沒有具體說明是誰？
Was that Marine identified in the letter?

1070
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,710
沒有，我通知指揮官傑賽普上校…
No. I notified the barracks C.O. Colonel Jessup...

1071
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,760
我將會前往調查
that I would be coming down to investigate.

1072
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,550
調查結果呢？
And what did you find?

1073
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:16,720
記錄顯示只有一名哨兵歸還武器時…
The shift reported only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch...

1074
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,810
少了一發子彈
with a round of ammunition missing.

1075
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:22,100
是誰？ 哈羅德·道森准下士
Who was that? Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.

1076
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,730
該你問了
Your witness.

1077
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,690
米蓋爾先生 你向道森詢問過開槍事件嗎？
Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Dawson about the fenceline shooting?

1078
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:33,740
問過，他聲稱對方有不利於他的行動
Yes. He claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy.

1079
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,990
你不相信他嗎？ 這不關我的…
You don'believe him? It's not my place...

1080
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:41,040
為什麼道森准下士觸犯了軍規卻沒有 因為無故向敵方開槍受到起訴呢？
Lance Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes. Why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause?

1081
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,710
沒有足夠的證據來起訴
There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge.

1082
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,670
謝謝
Thank you.

1083
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,880
米蓋爾先生，我不明白…
Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what you mean when you say...

1084
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,590
「沒有足夠的證據」是指什麼
"There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge."

1085
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,930
你有威廉·聖地亞哥的信
You had William Santiago's letter.

1086
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,140
聖地亞哥是唯一的目擊者
Santiago was the only eyewitness.

1087
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,640
我沒來得及詢問他 所以不知道他看到了什麼
I never had the chance to interview him, so I don't know what he saw.

1088
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,850
我們永遠不會知道了，是不是？ 是的
And now we'll never know, will we, Mr. McGuire?

1089
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,440
我問完了 證人請退下
No more questions. The witness is excused.

1090
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,160
海軍陸戰隊Ｗ步兵警衛連二Ｂ排…
Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker, Marine Barracks...

1091
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,490
卡爾·愛德華·漢梅克下士
Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Bravo.

1092
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:29,460
下士，九月六日下午肯德瑞克上尉 召集二排開會時你是否在場？
Corporal, were you present at a meeting that Lieutenant Kendrick held... on the afternoon of September 6 with the members of the Second Platoon?

1093
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,750
在場，長官
Yes, sir.

1094
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:33,460
能說說會議的內容是什麼嗎？
Would you tell the court the substance of that meeting?

1095
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,720
肯德瑞克上尉說我們排有個告密的…
Lieutenant Kendrick told us we had an informer in our group...

1096
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,470
一等兵聖地亞哥越級…
that Private Santiago had gone outside the chain of command...

1097
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,470
向海軍調查處舉報排裡的一名隊員
and reported to the N.I.S. On a member of our platoon.

1098
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:46,480
這是不是讓你很氣憤？ 你可以說實話，下士
Did that make you mad? You can tell the truth, Corporal.

1099
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,350
你是不是很生氣？ 是的，長官
Did it make you mad? Yes, sir.

1100
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,600
有多生氣？
How mad?

1101
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:53,570
一等兵聖地亞哥違背了 我們深信不疑的一條規矩，長官
Private Santiago betrayed a code we believe in very deeply, sir.

1102
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:56,650
其他隊員有沒有生氣？ 反對無根據的假設
Were the other squad members angry? Object. Speculation.

1103
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:58,910
比方說道森和多尼？ 控方律師這是在…
Were Dawson and Downey? Is the government counsel...

1104
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:03,530
直接要求證人證實我當事人的想法嗎？
honestly asking the witness to testify as to how my clients felt?

1105
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,540
反對有效
Sustained.

1106
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:11,330
下士，肯德瑞克上尉 在會上是否下過什麼命令？
Corporal, did Lieutenant Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting?

1107
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,500
是的，長官 什麼命令？
Yes, sir. What was it?

1108
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:19,340
他明令我們不得擅自處理這件事
Well, it was clear that he didn't want us taking matters into our own hands.

1109
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,390
是什麼命令？
What was the order?

1110
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,270
長官，他說不許碰聖地亞哥
Sir, he said Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1111
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:29,350
該你問了
Your witness.

1112
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:34,360
漢梅克下士，散會五分鐘後 你是否去過道森和多尼的房間？
Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson and Downey's barracks... five minutes after this meeting?

1113
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,980
沒有，長官
No, sir.

1114
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,740
謝謝，我問完了
Thanks. I have no more questions.

1115
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,860
證人請退下
The witness is excused.

1116
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,040
控方請求傳雷蒙德·湯馬斯下士
The government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas.

1117
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,330
我知道羅斯上尉是打算傳召…
I understand Captain Ross is planning on calling all the other members...

1118
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,040
Ｗ步兵警衛連的所有隊員來作證
of Rifle Security Company Windward to testify.

1119
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,290
顯然凱菲中尉的辯護重點…
In light of the defense Lieutenant Kaffee is planning to mount...

1120
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:59,300
和排長的明確指示有相當大的關係
the explicit instructions of a platoon leader seems particularly relevant.

1121
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,880
辯方可以同意全部二十二名證人…
The defense is willing to concede that all 22 witnesses...

1122
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,260
的證詞和漢梅克下士基本一致…
will testify substantially as Corporal Hammaker did...

1123
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,720
只要控方同意九月六日下午四點二十分…
if the government is willing to concede that none of them...

1124
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,390
他們誰都不在道森和多尼的房間
were in Dawson and Downey's room at 16:20 on September 6.

1125
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,400
上尉？
Captain?

1126
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,940
控方可以同意
The government will stipulate.

1127
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,990
現在休庭，你可以 明天傳訊你的下一位證人
Then we'll adjourn for the day. You can call your next witness tomorrow.

1128
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,990
全體起立
All rise.

1129
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,380
我要再演習一下醫生那段
I want to go over the doctor again.

1130
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,340
還是直接了當吧 那我們已經演習過了
We're taking the right approach. We've been over this already.

1131
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:41,010
聽我說，三點鐘時斯通醫生 還說不知道聖地亞哥的死因
Listen to me. 3:00... Stone says he doesn't know what killed Santiago.

1132
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,760
等見過傑賽普之後 五點鐘時他卻說是中毒
Then he meets with Jessup, and at 5:00 he says it was poison?

1133
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,600
醫生沒有說實話 哦，真是個救星
The doctor's not telling the truth. Oh, that's a relief!

1134
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,770
但我作辯時總不能說他是在撒謊吧
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use the "liar, liar, pants on fire" defense.

1135
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:55,770
我們無法證明他受過脅迫 還是溫習一下手頭掌握的材料吧
We can't prove coercion. Let's go over what we have, okay?

1136
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:09,660
一等兵聖地亞哥 是零點十二分分送到急救室的…
Private Santiago was admitted to the E.R. At 0012...

1137
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:13,290
在零點三十七分被確認死亡
and he was pronounced dead at 0037.

1138
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:16,540
斯通醫生，什麼是乳酸中毒？
Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?

1139
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,750
如果 肌肉及人體的其他細胞燃燒的是糖…
If the muscles and other cells of the body burn sugar...

1140
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,670
而不是氧，體內就會產生乳酸
instead of oxygen, lactic acid is produced.

1141
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:26,180
正是乳酸導致了聖地亞哥肺出血
That lactic acid is what caused Santiago's lungs to bleed.

1142
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,180
通常肌肉和其他細胞要多長時間…
Normally, how long does it take for the muscles and other cells...

1143
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,680
才開始燃燒糖而不是氧？
to begin burning sugar instead of oxygen?

1144
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,310
二十到三十分鐘
Twenty to thirty minutes.

1145
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:38,150
是什麼原因 加速了聖地亞哥肌肉的這種反應？
And what caused this process to be sped up in Santiago's muscles?

1146
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:40,360
某種攝入性中毒
An ingested poison of some kind.

1147
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,490
法官大人，我反對，證人是在推斷
Your Honor, we object at this point. The witness is speculating.

1148
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:45,610
斯通中校是醫學專家
Commander Stone is an expert medical witness.

1149
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:48,160
他的觀點不能認為是推斷
In this courtroom, his opinion is not considered speculation.

1150
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,240
斯通中校是內科醫生，不是犯罪學專家
Commander Stone is an internist, not a criminologist.

1151
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,870
醫學事實在法庭上不是決定性的
The medical facts here are ultimately inconclusive.

1152
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:57,670
我相信你可以通過交互提問證明這一點
A point I'm confident you'll illustrate to the court under cross-examination.

1153
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:00,880
所以應該不介意我們暫時認可其觀點
So I'm sure you won't mind if his opinion is admitted now.

1154
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,710
當然，大人
Not at all, sir.

1155
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:09,390
斯通醫生 威廉·聖地亞哥是死於中毒嗎？
Dr. Stone, did Willie Santiago die of poisoning?

1156
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,140
毫無疑問
Absolutely.

1157
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:15,350
你知道化驗室和驗屍官的報告 都顯示沒有毒藥的痕跡嗎？
You're aware that the lab and coroner's report show no traces of poison?

1158
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,940
知道 那你怎麼證明…
Yes, I am. Then how do you justify...

1159
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,980
嚴格說來有很多種毒素…
There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable...

1160
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:23,690
在人體組織中是無法檢測到的
both in the human body and on a fabric.

1161
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:27,490
在這一案例中酸中毒癥狀是顯而易見的
The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor on this issue.

1162
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,200
謝謝，長官
Thank you, sir.

1163
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,500
中校，如果有人患了某種病…
Commander, is it possible for a person to have an affliction...

1164
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,000
在某種情形下… 有沒有可能加速酸中毒的過程呢？
some sort of condition... which might speed up the process of acidosis?

1165
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:44,510
有可能嗎，中校？
Commander, is it possible?

1166
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,420
有可能
It's possible.

1167
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:48,930
在什麼情形下呢？
What might some of those conditions be?

1168
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:52,510
如果患有冠狀動脈紊亂…
If a person had a coronary disorder...

1169
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:55,640
或是大腦紊亂，就會加速該過程
or a cerebral disorder, the process would be more rapid.

1170
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,730
如果我有冠狀動脈問題 在嘴裡塞上一塊乾淨的抹布…
If I had a coronary condition and a clean rag was placed in my mouth...

1171
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:03,570
塞得非常深，我的細胞是否有可能…
and the rag was pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells...

1172
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:06,400
在拿掉抹布後繼續燃燒糖分呢？
would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out?

1173
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,410
那得是病情非常嚴重的情況下
It would have to be a very serious condition.

1174
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,700
是否有可能病情非常嚴重…
Is it possible to have a serious coronary condition...

1175
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:15,240
但癥狀很輕微，以至於在常規的…
where the warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician...

1176
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,830
體檢時被醫生忽略呢？
during a routine medical exam?

1177
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:21,170
有可能，但還是會有跡象
Possibly. There would still be symptoms, though.

1178
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:23,590
何種跡象？ 有好幾百種…
What kind of symptoms? There are hundreds...

1179
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,920
胸口疼？ 是的
Chest pains? Yes.

1180
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,920
氣喘？ 是的
Shortness of breath? Yes.

1181
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,430
疲勞？ 當然
Fatigue? Of course.

1182
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:37,980
醫生，這是你的簽名嗎？
Doctor, is this your signature?

1183
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,690
是的
Yes, it is.

1184
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,150
這上面表明 應限制給聖地亞哥分配任務
This is an order for Private Santiago to be put on restrictive duty.

1185
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:49,150
請你讀一下你寫在下面的備註好嗎？
Would you read your handwritten remarks at the bottom of the page, please?

1186
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:53,450
初步測試，陰性，患者胸口疼痛…
"Initial testing, negative. Patient complains of chest pains...

1187
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,660
氣喘且易疲勞
shortness of breath and fatigue.

1188
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,540
每週跑步的距離應限制在五英里以內
Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week."

1189
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,840
中校，有沒有可能 聖地亞哥患有嚴重的疾病…
Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago had a serious condition...

1190
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:12,300
而這種疾病會導致化學反應的加速？ 不會
and it was that condition that caused the accelerated chemical reaction?

1191
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,140
不可能嗎？
It's not possible?

1192
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,180
是的，我親自給每個人 做過徹底的身體檢查
I personally give each man a thorough physical examination.

1193
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,350
一等兵聖地亞哥各方面都很健康
Private Santiago was given a clean bill of health.

1194
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:24,980
所以非得是中毒對吧，中校？
That's why it had to be poison, right, Commander?

1195
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:29,150
因為如果你讓一個 冠狀動脈有嚴重問題的人出任務…
'Cause if you put a man with a serious coronary condition on duty...

1196
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:31,650
而這人死於與心臟有關的事故…
and that man died from a heart-related incident...

1197
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,740
你就會有大麻煩，是嗎？
you'd have a lot to answer for, wouldn't you, Doctor?

1198
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,870
反對，請求駁回 反對有效
Object! Move to strike. Sustained.

1199
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,080
我問完了，法官先生
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

1200
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:44,830
斯通醫生，你獲得行醫執照已有十七年
Dr. Stone, you've held a medical license for 17 years.

1201
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,090
通過了內科醫學委員會的鑒定
You're Board-certified in internal medicine.

1202
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:52,720
在一家為五千四百二十六人服務的醫院 任內科主管
You are chief of internal medicine at a hospital which serves 5,426 people.

1203
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:57,680
以你的醫學專業觀點來看 聖地亞哥是死於中毒嗎？
In your professional medical opinion, was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1204
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,480
辯方重申反對斯通中校的證詞…
We renew our objection to Commander Stone's testimony...

1205
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,640
並要求從筆錄中撤回
and ask that it be stricken from the record.

1206
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:06,690
請求陪審團對該證人的證詞不予考慮
We further ask the court members to lend no weight to this witness's testimony.

1207
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:08,360
反對無效，予以駁回
The objection is overruled.

1208
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,570
辯方強烈反對並要求進行合議…
The defense strenuously objects and requests an 802 conference...

1209
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:16,780
這樣庭上可以有機會在判決前聽到辯論
so that His Honor might have a chance to hear discussion before ruling.

1210
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:20,370
辯方的反對我已經聽到，反對無效
The objection of the defense has been heard and overruled.

1211
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:23,120
請求重新考慮 你的反對已被記錄下來
Move to reconsider. Your objection is noted.

1212
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,170
該證人是一位專家，法庭要聽聽他的觀點
The witness is an expert, and the court will hear his opinion!

1213
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:36,220
斯通醫生，以你的專業經驗所見…
Dr. Stone, in your expert, professional opinion...

1214
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:39,060
威廉·聖地亞哥是死於中毒嗎？
was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1215
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,060
是的
Yes.

1216
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:44,890
謝謝，長官，我問完了
Thank you, sir. I have no more questions.

1217
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,020
中校，你可以下去了
Commander, you may step down.

1218
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:57,620
控方請求休庭 同時請求保留傳訊特別證人的權力
Please the court, while we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses... the government rests.

1219
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:01,330
本案押後至十九日星期一上午十點再審…
We'll stand in recess until 1000, Monday the 19th...

1220
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:04,830
屆時請辯方傳第一證人出庭
at which time, the defense will call its first witness.

1221
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:06,830
全體起立
All rise.

1222
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,050
「我強烈反對」？
"I strenuously object"?

1223
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:22,390
那有什麼用？ 「反對予以駁回」
Is that how it works? "Objection overruled."

1224
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:24,600
「不，不…我堅持反對」
"No, no. I strenuously object."

1225
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,150
「哦，既然你堅持反對 那我會予以重新考慮
"Oh, well, if you strenuously object, then I should take time to reconsider."

1226
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,770
至少記入了筆錄
I got it on the record.

1227
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,070
可也讓陪審團以為我們怕那個醫生
You also got the court members thinking we're afraid of the doctor.

1228
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:34,860
反對一次就能讓人知道他不是犯罪學專家
You object once, so they can hear us say he's not a criminologist.

1229
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:38,570
不斷重申就讓人感覺 這是律師的古怪花招了
You keep after it, and suddenly it looks like a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks.

1230
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:41,740
書上的法律和庭上的法律是兩回事
It's the difference between paper law and trial law.

1231
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,290
結果法官只好強調斯通是專家
You even had the judge saying Stone was an expert!

1232
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:47,250
她已經犯了錯，我們不要再提了
She made a mistake. Let's not relive it.

1233
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,550
我要給我妻子打電話，晚上見
I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll see you tonight.

1234
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:57,050
你為什麼這樣恨他們？
Why do you hate them so much?

1235
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,590
他們以強凌弱，這是事實
They beat up on a weakling. That's all they did.

1236
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:02,680
其他的全都是廢話
The rest of this is just smoke-filled coffee house crap.

1237
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,890
他們折磨過一個虛弱的年輕人
They tortured and tormented a weaker kid!

1238
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:07,980
因為不喜歡他就殺了他
They didn't like him, so they killed him.

1239
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:10,980
為什麼？因為他跑得不快
And why? Because he couldn't run very fast!

1240
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:14,690
好了，今晚大家都休息吧
All right. Everybody take the night off.

1241
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,690
對不起 我知道
I'm sorry. I know.

1242
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:19,530
我們連著三周半每天工作二十個小時
We've been working 20 hours a day for three and halfweeks straight.

1243
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:22,990
就休息一晚，去看看你太太和女兒
Just take the night off. Go see your wife, your daughter.

1244
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:25,200
喬，你去…
Jo, go do...

1245
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:30,080
反正不用來，你想幹什麼就幹什麼吧
whatever it is you do when you're not here.

1246
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,840
明天星期幾？ 星期六
What day is tomorrow? Saturday.

1247
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,840
我們十點碰頭
We start at 10:00.

1248
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,180
你為什麼這樣維護他們？
Why do you like them so much?

1249
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,640
因為他們在守衛邊疆…
'Cause they stand on a wall...

1250
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:52,020
而且保證 「今晚有我站崗，沒什麼能傷害你們」
and they say, "Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight, not on my watch."

1251
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,900
別擔心那個醫生，審判要星期一才開始
Don't worry about the doctor. This trial starts Monday.

1252
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:09,080
有兩人出局，安達將球擊向左中場
1 and 2 with two out. Anda line drive to left center.

1253
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,380
克比上壘失敗
Kirby racing. He won't get there.

1254
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:18,840
第三個跑壘員是卡爾·瑞普肯…
And rounding third is Cal Ripken... and the Twins'streak is over.

1255
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,720
第三個跑壘員是卡爾·瑞普肯…
One strike away, and Randy Milligan feels right now like Hulk Hogan.

1256
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:32,060
很抱歉打擾你，我該先打個電話
I'm sorry to bother you. I should've called first.

1257
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:36,610
沒關係，我只是在看球賽，進來吧
No, I was just watching a ball game. Come on in.

1258
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:56,920
我是想…你願意和我一起去吃晚飯嗎？
I was wondering if... How you'd feel about my taking you to dinner tonight?

1259
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,960
你是想和我約會嗎？ 不是
Are you asking me out on a date? No.

1260
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,050
聽上去你是想約我 不是
Sounded like you were asking me on a date.

1261
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:05,180
以前有人約過我，聽起來就是那個意思
I've been asked out on dates before, and that's what it sounded like.

1262
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:08,600
喜歡海鮮嗎？我知道一個好地方
Do you like seafood? I know a good seafood place.

1263
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,530
我第三件案子是一起酗酒鬧事案
My third case was a drunk and disorderly.

1264
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:23,450
花了九個星期 我把那晚在酒吧的三十一個人都找遍了
It lasted nine weeks. I rounded up 31 people from the bar that night.

1265
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:26,950
酗酒鬧事花了九個星期？ 控方想怎麼判？
Nine weeks on a D and D? What was the prosecutor offering?

1266
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:28,950
十五天
Fifteen days.

1267
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,410
當事人真是免遭大難
You sure hustled the shit out of him.

1268
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,880
後來他們把我調到了內政部
Well, after that they moved me to Internal Affairs.

1269
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,920
不能怪他們 我…
Tough to blame them. Where I have earned...

1270
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,710
得過兩枚立功獎章和兩次獎狀
two meritorious service medals and two letters of commendation.

1271
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:44,840
你幹嘛總是和我說你的過去？
Why are you always giving me your resume?

1272
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,600
我想要你承認我是個好律師
Because I want you to think I'm a good lawyer.

1273
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,680
我承認
I do.

1274
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:54,980
不，你沒有
No, you don't.

1275
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,690
我覺得你是個了不起的律師
I think you're an exceptional lawyer.

1276
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,160
我注意過陪審團 你能引起他們的共鳴，他們喜歡你
I watch the court members. They respond to you. They like you.

1277
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,830
你令他們信服，我覺得道森和多尼…
I see you convincing them, and I think Dawson and Downey...

1278
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:11,580
的下半輩子就得靠你了
are gonna end up owing their lives toyou.

1279
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,130
喬，我覺得…
Jo, I think...

1280
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:22,510
你應該對我們會輸的事實現好心理準備
I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose.

1281
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:25,970
羅斯說的那些都是事實
Ross's opening statement... it was all true.

1282
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:30,930
我們可以暫時假設他們是奉命行事
Let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter... that the guys were given an order.

1283
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,680
但無法證明確有其事
I can't prove it ever happened.

1284
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,230
我們可以繼續設法去證明…
We'll keep doing what we're doing and we'll put on a show...

1285
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:41,860
但我們掌握的所有證據 都是兩個被指控謀殺的人提供的
but all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder.

1286
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:44,740
我們會找到馬金森
We'll find Markinson.

1287
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:49,450
喬，我們會輸，而且會輸得很慘
Jo, we're gonna lose, and we're gonna lose huge.

1288
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:57,920
古巴關達那摩灣海軍陸戰隊Ｗ連 傑弗瑞·歐文·巴恩斯下士
Corporal Jeffrey Owen Barnes, Marine Barracks Windward... Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1289
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,380
巴恩斯下士，請說明一下 隊員會因哪些理由被執行「紅色條規」
Corporal Barnes, name some reasons why a Marine would receive a Code Red.

1290
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,840
排裡或連隊開會時遲到
Being late for platoon or company meetings.

1291
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,800
營房總是亂七八糟，跑步時掉隊
Keeping his barracks in disorder. Falling back on a run.

1292
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,390
你接受過「紅色條規」嗎？ 是的，長官
Have you ever received a Code Red? Yes, sir.

1293
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:16,020
我在進行分組突襲訓練時武器滑落了
We were doing seven-man assault drills, and my weapon slipped.

1294
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,400
因為當時氣溫超過一百度 我的手心全是汗…
It was'cause it was over 100 degrees, and my palms were sweaty...

1295
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:23,110
而我忘了象學過的那樣抹上松香
and I'd forgotten to use the resin like we were taught.

1296
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:24,690
結果呢？
What happened?

1297
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:27,860
當天夜裡我的隊友用毯子蒙住我…
That night, the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me...

1298
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,740
狠狠揍了我五分鐘…
took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes...

1299
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:33,410
然後在我的手上塗上膠水
then they poured glue on my hands.

1300
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:37,250
這很管用 因為從那以後我的武器再沒有脫過手
And it worked too,'cause I aingt never dropped my weapon since.

1301
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,750
一等兵聖地亞哥開會時遲過到嗎？
Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings?

1302
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,920
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

1303
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,420
他的營房很亂嗎？ 是的，長官
Was his barracks ever in disorder? Yes, sir.

1304
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,800
他跑步時掉過隊嗎？ 每次都是，長官
Did he ever fall back on a run? All the time, sir.

1305
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:53,260
九月六日晚上之前 他有沒有接受過「紅色條規」？
Did he ever, prior to the night of September 6, receive a Code Red?

1306
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,760
沒有，長官
No, sir.

1307
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:56,930
從來沒有？ 沒有，長官
Never? No, sir.

1308
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,980
你因為手掌出汗受過一次「紅色條規」
You got a Code Red'cause your palms were sweaty.

1309
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:05,190
為什麼聖地亞哥 總是拖後腿卻沒受過一次呢？
Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one?

1310
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:08,610
因為道森不允許，長官
Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

1311
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:11,780
道森不允許
Dawson wouldn't allow it.

1312
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:15,450
大家都對聖地亞哥很兇，但沒有碰過他
The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they wouldn't go near him.

1313
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,450
因為都很怕道森
They were too afraid of Dawson.

1314
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:20,000
反對，證人是在推斷
Object. The witness is speculating.

1315
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,750
我換個問法，傑弗瑞你想過 要對聖地亞哥執行「紅色條規」嗎？
I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a Code Red?

1316
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,750
是的，長官 為什麼沒有呢？
Yes, sir. Why didn't you?

1317
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,630
因為道森會收拾我，長官
'Cause Dawson would kick my butt, sir.

1318
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:32,720
很好，現在輪到羅斯上尉問你話了
Good enough. Captain Ross is gonna ask you some questions now.

1319
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:35,930
巴恩斯下士…
Corporal Barnes...

1320
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:39,930
這有本新兵訓練用的「陸戰隊綱要」
I hold here the Marine Outline for Recruit Training.

1321
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:41,730
你熟悉這本書嗎？ 是的，長官
Are you familiar with this book? Yes, sir.

1322
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:43,480
你看過沒有？ 看過，長官
Have you read it? Yes, sir.

1323
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,900
好的，請你翻到 關於「紅色條規」的章節行嗎？
Would you turn to the chapter that deals with Code Reds, please?

1324
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:53,030
只要翻到描述「紅色條規」的那一頁
Just flip to the page of the book that discusses Code Reds.

1325
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,750
要知道，長官 「紅色條規」是我們用的一個術語
Well, you see, sir, Code Red is a term that we use.

1326
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,500
只限於關達那摩…
Just down in Gitmo...

1327
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,670
好在還有本書
Oh, we're in luck, then.

1328
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,420
古巴關達那摩灣 步兵警衛連行為規範守則
Standard Operating Procedure, Rifle Security Company, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1329
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:14,510
我猜這本書裡 會有「紅色條規」的定義條款
I assume we'll find the term Code Red and its definition in that book.

1330
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,390
沒有，長官 沒有？
No, sir.

1331
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:18,260
下士，難道陸戰隊員…
Corporal Barnes, I'm a Marine.

1332
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:22,520
沒有書，沒有手冊 也沒有制訂規章制度…
Is there no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations...

1333
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,110
讓大家明白執行「紅色條規」 是陸戰隊員的職責之一嗎？
that lets me know that as a Marine one of my duties is to perform Code Reds?

1334
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:30,610
沒有，長官，沒這種書，長官
No, sir. No book, sir.

1335
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:32,610
我問完了
No further questions.

1336
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:37,240
下士，請你將書翻到…
Corporal, would you turn to the page in this book...

1337
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,700
有餐廳位置說明的那一頁
that says where the mess hall is, please?

1338
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,910
凱菲中尉，書裡沒有這個，長官
Lieutenant Kaffee, that's not in the book, sir.

1339
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:47,380
你是說 你在關達那摩期間從沒吃過飯嗎？
You mean to say in all your time at Gitmoyou've never had a meal?

1340
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:50,630
不，長官，一日三餐都會吃，長官
No, sir. Three squares a day, sir.

1341
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,970
這我就不懂了
I don't understand.

1342
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:56,180
書裡沒說，那你怎麼知道餐廳在哪？
How did you know where the mess hall was if it's not in this book?

1343
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,930
在吃飯時間跟著大家一起去就能知道
Well, I guess I just followed the crowd at chow time, sir.

1344
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:05,060
我問完了
No more questions.

1345
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:08,860
巴恩斯下士，你可以下去了 謝謝，長官
Corporal Barnes, you may step down. Thank you, sir.

1346
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,910
今晚七點，最後演練一下 對肯德瑞克的問話
7:00 tonight we'll do a final Kendrick review.

1347
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,910
我要讓他目瞪口呆
I want to slam-dunk this guy.

1348
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,880
嘿，盧瑟
Hey, Luther.

1349
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,470
「海軍上將」，案子的進展如何？
Admiral, how's the big case going?

1350
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:37,510
忙得團團轉
Nose to the grindstone.

1351
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:40,760
蒼蠅都沒法落在你身上 正是這樣
No flies on you. A rolling stone gathers no moss.

1352
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,350
鹿死誰手尚未可知
Well, it aingt over till the fat lady sings.

1353
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:45,770
你可以再說一次
You can say that again.

1354
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:49,190
鹿死誰手尚未可知
It aingt over till the fat lady sings. Till the fat lady sings.

1355
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:52,190
說起來輕鬆
Walked into that one.

1356
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,460
哦，我的天
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1357
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,210
你沒鎖車門
You left the door unlocked.

1358
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:12,340
你嚇得我魂都沒了 繼續往前開
You scared the shit out of me. Just keep driving.

1359
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:14,340
知道法庭想傳訊你嗎？
Are you aware you're under subpoena?

1360
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:18,220
知道，我還知道 有兩名陸戰隊員的命運掌握在你手中
Yes. I'm also aware that the lives of two Marines are in your hands.

1361
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:22,930
因為我沒能阻止事態的發展 所以只好來幫你一把
If there was something I could do about that, I would. But since I can't, all I can do is help you.

1362
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:25,310
你知道些什麼？ 所有細節
What do you know? I know everything.

1363
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:27,600
是一次「紅色條規」嗎？ 是的
Was it a Code Red? Yes.

1364
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,810
是肯德瑞克下的命令？ 是的
Did Kendrick give the order? Yes.

1365
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:32,820
是你親眼所見嗎？ 用不著
Did you witness it? I didn't need to.

1366
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,530
那你怎麼知道？你根本不知道
Then how do you know? You know shit.

1367
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:37,990
他決不會被調離基地
He was never gonna be transferred off that base.

1368
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:47,210
傑賽普想讓他留在基地，說要好好教訓他
Jessup was gonna keep him on the base. He said he wanted him trained.

1369
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:49,870
可調令是你簽發的 我知道
The transfer order has your signature. Yeah, I know.

1370
01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:54,000
是聖地亞哥死後第五天 你們到古巴的當天早上簽的
I signed it the morning you arrived in Cuba, five days after Santiago died.

1371
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:00,340
我會為你爭取舉報人豁免權
I'm gonna get you a deal, some kind of immunity with the prosecutor.

1372
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:04,930
四天後你要出面作證 把你知道的事情說出來
In about four days, you'll appear as a witness and tell what you know.

1373
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:08,640
我給你找家旅館，我們要從頭來過
I'm gonna check you into a motel. We are gonna start from the beginning.

1374
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,860
用不著協議，我也不需要豁免權
I don't want a deal, and I don't want immunity.

1375
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:18,280
我只想讓你知道 我為自己曾做過和正在做的事而自豪
I want you to know that I'm proud neither of what I've done or am doing.

1376
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:22,450
他在哪？ 「東北市區旅館」
Where is he? The Downtown Lodge in Northeast.

1377
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:24,660
要保證他的安全 是個好提議
I want him guarded. That's a good idea.

1378
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,450
我的安全調查號碼是 411527273 安全調查號？
My clearance code is 411527273. Clearance code?

1379
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:30,210
謝謝 你有安全調查號嗎？
Thank you. Do you have a clearance code?

1380
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,380
我是喬·蓋洛維，我要保護一個證人
This is Jo Galloway. I need to secure a witness.

1381
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,420
總之他說 傑賽普在調離基地一事上撒了謊
Anyway, he also said that Jessup's lying about the transportation off the base.

1382
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:38,300
傑賽普說最早的航班是第二天六點
Jessup said that 6:00 the next morning was the first flight leaving.

1383
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:41,880
馬金森說七小時之前就有飛機飛離基地
Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier.

1384
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,970
我記得很清楚，你聽到我說的話嗎？
That was impressive. Did you hear what I said about the flight?

1385
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:48,310
山姆，飛機何時起飛有記錄可查對嗎？
Sam, when a flight takes off, there's a record kept, right?

1386
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:50,560
對，得找到基地指揮塔的航行日誌
Yeah, you need the tower chiefs log from Gitmo.

1387
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,770
把它找來 我們會贏的
Get it. We're gonna win.

1388
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:56,230
還不知道馬金森是否可靠 航行日誌還在不在
We don't know who Markinson is. We don't know what the logbook will say.

1389
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,320
你去做多尼的工作，我去向羅斯透露一下
You just concentrate on Downey. I'm gonna tell Ross where we are.

1390
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:09,870
今天詢問巴恩斯時表現真不錯
Nice work today. Redirect on Barnes.

1391
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:14,080
我找到了馬金森 他在哪？
I have Markinson. Where is he?

1392
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,460
「東北」的一個房間 有六個聯邦密探守在門口
Motel room in Northeast with six Federal Marshalls outside his door.

1393
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,670
馬金森簽發的調令是偽造的
The transfer that Markinson signed is phony.

1394
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,590
傑賽普說最早的航班在早上六點是撒謊
Jessup's statement that the 6:00 a.m. Flight was the first available is a lie.

1395
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:26,100
我們在查航空日誌，啤酒
We're checking the tower chiefs log. I'd like a beer, please.

1396
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:30,600
同時我要讓肯德瑞克出庭 到時就有好戲可看了
In the meantime, I'm gonna put Kendrick on the stand and have some fun.

1397
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,440
好吧，我有義務提醒你…
All right, I have an obligation to tell you...

1398
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,610
如果沒有適當的證據 想起訴肯德瑞克或傑賽普…
that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessup of any crime without proper evidence...

1399
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:39,440
你會被軍事法庭以瀆職罪論處
you'll be subject to a court-martial for professional misconduct.

1400
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,110
會記入你的檔案 不管你以後找什麼工作都擺脫不了
That's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out.

1401
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:49,290
馬金森靠不住，丹尼，他是個瘋子
Markinson's not gonna hold up, Danny. He's a crazy man.

1402
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:52,960
我這麼說不是想嚇你，是為你著想
I'm not saying this to intimidate you. I'm being your lawyer here.

1403
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,130
謝謝，傑克 我覺得你們這幫人都是見鬼的瘋子
Thanks, Jack. And I think the fucking bunch of you are certifiably insane.

1404
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:59,550
你們的禮法讓我看不順眼
Your code of honor makes me want to beat the shit out of somebody.

1405
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:03,470
別因為我穿同樣的制服 就把我和他們混為一談
Don't lump me in with them just because we wear the same uniform.

1406
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:06,640
我是你的朋友 也認為你的當事人不該去監獄…
I'm your friend, and I don't think your clients belong in jail...

1407
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,600
但我無權決定
but I don't get to make that decision.

1408
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:13,100
我代表美國政府，不能帶感情色彩或偏見
I represent the United States government without passion or prejudice.

1409
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:16,520
我的當事人證據充分 你的酒
My client has a case. Here you go.

1410
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:23,150
你該感謝我作為軍事檢察官提醒你…
I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware...

1411
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:28,240
沒有充分的證據想指控一名 海軍陸戰隊軍官犯有重罪會有什麼後果
of the possible consequences involved in accusing a Marine officer... of a felony without proper evidence.

1412
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,990
我聽過這樣的忠告
I've been so advised.

1413
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,000
你是被逼上法庭的，丹尼
You got bullied into that courtroom, Danny.

1414
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,920
所有人都給你壓力，有道森，有蓋洛維
By everyone. By Dawson, by Galloway.

1415
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,550
見鬼，實際上我也有挑釁你
Shit, I practically dared you.

1416
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,300
你父親當年的盛名也在逼迫你步入法庭
You got bullied into that courtroom by the memory of a dead lawyer.

1417
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:58,520
你是個下流卑鄙沒種的對手，傑克
You're a lousy fucking softball player, Jack!

1418
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:06,110
你的小伙子們完了，丹尼 我再也無能為力了
Your boys are going down, Danny. I can't stop it anymore.

1419
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,700
肯德瑞克上尉，你認為 一等兵聖地亞哥是個好陸戰隊員嗎？
Lieutenant Kendrick, in your opinion, was Private Santiago a good Marine?

1420
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,830
我只能說他很一般
I'd say he was about average.

1421
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,330
你在三份聖地亞哥的考核報告上簽過名
You signed three proficiency and conduct reports on Santiago.

1422
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:24,130
你在所有這些報告上 都是給予中等偏下的評語
On all three reports, you indicate a rating of below average.

1423
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:31,390
是的，一等兵聖地亞哥的表現 是低於一般水平
Yes, Private Santiago was below average.

1424
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:35,220
我看不出有必要再踐踏一個死者的尊嚴
I did not see the need to trample on a man's grave.

1425
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,440
我們非常贊同，但你是發過誓的
We appreciate that, but you're under oath now.

1426
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,150
也許會令人不快，但我們是想瞭解真相
Unpleasant as it may be, we'd all just as soon hear the truth.

1427
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:42,070
我知道我發過誓
I'm aware of my oath.

1428
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:47,110
這是道森准下士最近的三份考核報告 上面有你的簽名
These are the last three pro-con reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson.

1429
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:49,110
兩次被評為優異…
Dawson received two marks of exceptional...

1430
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:53,580
但最後一份即六月九日 的報告上他得到的評語是中等偏下
but on this most recent report of June 9 he received a rating of below average.

1431
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:57,620
我想討論一下這最後一份報告 沒問題
I'd like to discuss this last report. That would be fine.

1432
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:01,380
道森准下士 從步兵學校畢業後的等級評定非常優秀
Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after the school of infantry was perfect.

1433
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:04,380
同班超過半數的人晉陞為下士時…
Over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal...

1434
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,710
道森還是個准下士
while Dawson has remained a lance corporal.

1435
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,800
道森晉陞受阻是因為最後這份報告嗎？
Was Dawson's promotion held up because of this last report?

1436
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:11,940
肯定是
I'm sure it was.

1437
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:15,030
為什麼這份報告 會給道森如此可憐的等級？
Do you recall why Dawson was given such a poor grade on this report?

1438
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,320
我確實忘了
I'm sure I don't.

1439
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,280
我手下有很多人，有很多報告要寫
I have many men in my charge. I write many reports.

1440
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:26,120
上尉，你是否能記起一名 叫柯蒂斯·貝爾的一等兵…
Lieutenant, do you recall an incident involving a P.F.C. Curtis Bell...

1441
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,910
從軍官俱樂部偷酒的事？
who'd been found stealing liquor from the Officers'Club?

1442
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,870
是的，有這事
Yes, I do.

1443
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,420
你是否向上級舉報過？
Did you report Private Bell to proper authorities?

1444
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,460
我床頭有兩本書…
I have two books at my bedside...

1445
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,550
「海軍陸戰隊員行為守則」和「聖經」
The Marine Corps Code of Conduct and The King james Bible.

1446
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:43,220
我唯一知道的上級就是我的指揮官…
The only proper authorities I'm aware of are my commanding officer...

1447
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,970
內森·Ｒ·傑賽普上校和上帝
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup and the Lord our God.

1448
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:50,100
以你的說法，上尉，我可以理解為…
At your request, Lieutenant Kendrick, I can have the record reflect...

1449
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,850
你不承認軍事法庭也是你的上級
your lack of acknowledgement of this court as a proper authority.

1450
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:55,770
反對，與本案無關 反對有效
Objection. Argumentative. Sustained.

1451
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,900
請注意，律師
Watch yourself, counselor.

1452
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,700
你向上級舉報柯蒂斯·貝爾沒有？
Did you report Private Bell to your superiors?

1453
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,530
我記憶中一等兵貝爾是很優秀的…
I remember thinking very highly of Private Bell...

1454
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:06,790
不希望看到他的履歷因此而染上污點
not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal charge.

1455
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:10,830
你更願意在單位內部解決是嗎？
You preferred it be handled within the unit?

1456
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,460
是的，確實如此
Yes, I most certainly did.

1457
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:18,960
你知道什麼是「紅色條規」嗎？ 是的，我知道
Do you know what a Code Red is? Yes, I do.

1458
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,220
你曾下令執行過「紅色條規」嗎？ 不，我沒有
Have you ever ordered a Code Red? No, I have not.

1459
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:25,390
你是否曾命令道森和另兩個部下…
Did you order Dawson and two other men to make sure that Private Bell...

1460
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:30,890
看住貝爾，總共七天 除了水之外不給他任何食物或飲料？
received no food or drink, except water, for a period of seven days?

1461
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:33,270
這是歪曲事實，中尉
That is a distortion of the truth, Lieutenant.

1462
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:35,610
一等兵貝爾是被監禁在營房內
Private Bell was placed on barracks restriction.

1463
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,780
有水和維他命作補充 而且我能向你保證…
He was given water and vitamin supplements, and I can assure you...

1464
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,820
他的健康從未受到威脅
at no time was his health in danger.

1465
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,620
我相信這對一等兵貝爾來說很有趣
I'm sure it was lovely for Private Bell.

1466
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,330
但你有沒有下令關禁閉呢？
But you did order the barracks restriction, didn't you?

1467
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:52,580
有沒有下令不提供食物呢？ 是的，我下過命令
You did order the denial of food? Yes, I did.

1468
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:56,500
這種形式的處罰 可以認為是屬於「紅色條規」嗎？
Wouldn't this form of discipline be considered a Code Red?

1469
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,130
不
No

1470
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:03,130
如果我傳關達那摩灣的 其他四百七十八名陸戰隊員作證…
If I called the other 478 Marines at Guantanamo Bayto testify...

1471
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:05,260
他們會認為這是「紅色條規」嗎？
would they consider it a Code Red?

1472
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:09,350
證人不可能證實 其他四百七十八個人會怎麼說
The witness can't possibly testify as to what 478 other men would say.

1473
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:13,270
控方反對這一系列的提問 這些與本案無關…
We object to this entire line of questioning. It's argumentative...

1474
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:15,690
是對證人的無端騷擾
and irrelevant badgering of the witness.

1475
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:18,400
控方反對有效，凱菲中尉…
The government's objection is sustained, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1476
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,610
我要提醒你 你正在詢問的是一名海軍軍官…
and I would remind you that you're now questioning a Marine officer...

1477
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:23,780
履歷記錄無可挑剔
with an impeccable service record.

1478
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,410
謝謝，法官大人
Thank you, Your Honor.

1479
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:30,330
上尉，道森最後那份報告 被給予中等偏下的評定…
Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating of below average on this last report...

1480
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:33,250
是因為你發覺他偷偷給貝爾食物嗎？
because you learned he'd been sneaking food to Private Bell?

1481
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,630
反對 別著急…上尉？
Object! Not so fast. Lieutenant?

1482
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,960
道森准下士被給予中等偏下的評語…
Lance Corporal Dawson was given a below average rating...

1483
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,380
是因為他違犯了軍規
because he had committed a crime.

1484
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:48,720
軍規？他犯了什麼軍規？
A crime? What crime did he commit?

1485
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:51,430
肯德瑞克上尉
Lieutenant Kendrick

1486
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:58,520
道森給一個飢餓的人送食物 犯了哪條軍規？
Dawson brought a hungry guy some food. What crime did he commit?

1487
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,900
他違反了命令
He disobeyed an order.

1488
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:04,530
因為他履行了自己的價值觀…
And because he exercised his own set ofvalues...

1489
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:07,570
作了與一名陸戰隊員健康有關的決定…
because he made a decision about the welfare of a Marine...

1490
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:11,290
而這與你的命令有牴觸，所以得受罰 是這樣嗎？
that was in conflict with your order, he was punished, is that right?

1491
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:14,910
道森准下士違反了命令
Lance Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order.

1492
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:17,500
可那不是真正的命令不是嗎？
Yeah, but it wasn't a real order, was it?

1493
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,750
畢竟現在是和平年代
After all, it's peacetime.

1494
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:23,090
他沒被派去守衛山頭或是進攻灘頭陣地
He wasn't being asked to secure a hill or advance on a beachhead.

1495
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:27,590
我是說 一名具備道森這種能力的陸戰隊員…
I mean, surely a Marine of Dawson's intelligence...

1496
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:30,760
完全可以自己決定哪些命令重要…
can be trusted to determine on his own which are the important orders...

1497
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,810
哪些命令有可能…在道德上有疑義
and which orders might, say, be morally questionable?

1498
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,440
肯德瑞克上尉？
Lieutenant Kendrick?

1499
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,770
是這樣嗎？
Can he?

1500
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:43,530
道森可以自己決定應該服從哪些命令嗎？
Can Dawson determine on his own which orders he's going to follow?

1501
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,280
不，他不能
No, he cannot.

1502
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,110
柯蒂斯·貝爾的事讓他受了教育，是吧？
A lesson he learned after the Curtis Bell incident, right?

1503
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:51,030
我想是的 你確信是這樣對吧？
I would think so. You know so, don't you?

1504
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:52,780
反對 反對有效
Object! Sustained.

1505
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,790
肯德瑞克上尉，最後一個問題
Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question.

1506
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,380
如果你命令道森 對聖地亞哥執行「紅色條規」…
If you had ordered Dawson to give Santiago a Code Red...

1507
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:06,670
我特地命令手下… 他會再次違反命令嗎？
I specifically ordered those men... Would he disobey you again?

1508
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:10,800
上尉，不必作答 用不著回答，我問完了
Lieutenant, don't answer that! You don't have to. I'm through.

1509
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,510
肯德瑞克上尉 你是否曾命令道森准下士…
Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Lance Corporal Dawson...

1510
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:18,640
和一等兵多尼 對威廉·聖地亞哥執行「紅色條規」？
and Private Downey to give Willie Santiago a Code Red?

1511
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,230
肯德瑞克上尉？
Lieutenant Kendrick?

1512
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:24,780
不，我沒有 謝謝
No, I did not. Thank you.

1513
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:30,860
怎麼樣？
What's the word?

1514
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:35,200
我拿到了指揮塔那天晚上的日誌 傑賽普說的是事實
I got the tower chiefs log from that night. Jessup's telling the truth.

1515
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:39,580
最早離開的航班是在早上六點 讓我看看
6:00 a.m. Flight was the first plane. Let me see this.

1516
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:52,590
今晚加班？ 是啊
Working late tonight? Oh, yeah.

1517
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:00,640
十一點根本沒有航班 你到底在搞什麼鬼？
There wasn't a flight at 11:00. What the fuck are you trying to pull?

1518
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,940
從關達那摩到美國最早的航班 是在二十三點
The first flight stateside left Guantanamo Bay at 2300.

1519
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:07,940
凌晨兩點過幾分抵達安德魯斯空軍基地
It arrived at Andrews Air Force Base at a few minutes past 2:00.

1520
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:11,240
是嗎？那為什麼指揮塔的日誌沒有記錄？
Really? Then why isn't it listed in the tower chiefs log?

1521
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,580
傑賽普
Jessup.

1522
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:17,120
你是說他竄改了日誌嗎？
What are you telling me? He fixed the logbook?

1523
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,210
也許他能更改起飛記錄 但我可以證明曾有飛機降落過
Maybe he can make it so a plane didn't take off, but I can prove one landed.

1524
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:25,340
我去安德魯斯找記錄
I'll get the logbook from Andrews.

1525
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:28,380
你在安德魯斯的日誌上也發現不了什麼
You're not gonna find anything in the Andrews logbook, either.

1526
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,380
他能讓整個航班消失嗎？
He can make an entire flight disappear?

1527
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:34,970
傑賽普就要被任命為安全委員會的主管了
Jessup is about to be appointed director of operations for the Security Council.

1528
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:39,060
不知道怎麼避開地雷 是休想得到那個位置的
You don't get to that position without knowing how to sidestep some land mines.

1529
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,980
可他沒法避開你
He's not gonna be able to sidestep you.

1530
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:44,440
你不會還想讓我出庭吧？
You don't still intend to put me on the stand?

1531
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:47,480
星期四上午十點
Thursday morning, 10:00.

1532
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:55,740
得找到能證實有那趟航班的人
There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight.

1533
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:59,040
這不像航空公司有固定的飛行時刻表
This isn't TWA. There isn't a regular flight schedule.

1534
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,910
你知道每天有多少架飛機起起落落？
Do you have any idea how many planes take off and land every day?

1535
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:05,420
地勤人員也記不住 那趟航班四周前的降落時間
A ground crew kid won't remember a flight that landed four weeks ago.

1536
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:08,630
不去查怎麼會知道呢？ 忘了那趟航班
How do you know if you don't check? Forget the flight!

1537
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:12,510
馬金森會證明傑賽普拒絕調走聖地亞哥
Markinson will testify that Jessup refused to transfer Santiago.

1538
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:15,140
他會證明調令是偽造的，這就夠了
He'll testify to the forged transfer, and that'll be enough.

1539
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,760
加上多尼的證詞應該夠了
That and Downey's testimony really ought to be enough.

1540
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:27,230
六號夜裡你們為什麼 進入聖地亞哥的房間？
Why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th?

1541
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:30,530
對一等兵聖地亞哥 執行「紅色條規」，夫人
To give Private Santiago a Code Red, ma'am.

1542
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:32,780
你們為什麼這樣做？
Why did you give him a Code Red?

1543
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:37,180
是Ｗ步兵警衛連 排長喬納森-詹姆斯-肯德瑞克上尉…
I was ordered to give him a Code Red by the platoon commander...

1544
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:40,660
下令對他執行「紅色條規」
of Rifle Security Company Windward, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1545
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:44,210
你們會沒事的
You're gonna do fine.

1546
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,340
你覺得會讓我們很快回連隊嗎，夫人？
You think they'll let us go back to our platoon soon, ma'am?

1547
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:51,630
絕對沒問題
Absolutely.

1548
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,300
記得提問的順序嗎？能肯定嗎？
Do you remember the order of questions? Areyou sure?

1549
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,310
簡練一點，不然他聽不懂就麻煩了
And we'll use small words,'cause he gets rattled ifhe doesn't understand.

1550
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:03,270
我是說節奏要慢一點 我會的
I'm just saying go slow. I'm gonna go slow.

1551
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,270
但要盡快把問題問完
And get him off as fast as you can.

1552
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:09,270
怎麼了？不會有問題的
What? It's gonna be fine.

1553
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:13,650
尊敬的聖地亞哥先生和夫人…
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Santiago...

1554
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:17,490
我是威廉的行政長官
I was William's executive officer.

1555
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:21,080
我對令郎不太熟悉，只知道他叫什麼名字
I knew your son vaguely, which is to say I knew his name.

1556
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:26,870
那兩個對令郎之死負有責任的人 的審判很快就有結果了
In a matter of time, the trial of the two men... charged with your son's death will be concluded...

1557
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:29,210
你們素不相識的七男兩女…
and seven men and two women whom you've never met...

1558
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:33,300
將試著為令郎的死給出一個解釋
will try to offer you an explanation as to why William is dead.

1559
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:37,050
而我已經盡我所能來使真相大白於天下
For my part, I've done as much as I can to bring the truth to light.

1560
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,340
事實上…
And the truth is this...

1561
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,010
令郎的死只有一個原因…
Your son is dead for only one reason...

1562
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,020
我阻止事態發展時不夠強硬
I wasn't strong enough to stop it.

1563
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:51,020
美國海軍，馬修-安德魯-馬金森中校 敬上
Always, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Andrew Markinson... United States Marine Corps.

1564
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:59,740
一等兵，我要你再向大家說一次
Private, I want you to tell us one last time.

1565
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:05,660
你們為什麼在九月六日夜裡 去一等兵聖地亞哥的房間？
Why did you go to Private Santiago's room on the night of September 6?

1566
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:10,540
是排長肯德瑞克上尉 命令我們去執行「紅色條規」
A Code Red was ordered by my platoon commander... Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1567
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,840
謝謝
Thank you.

1568
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,500
該你問了
Your witness.

1569
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:21,260
一等兵，九月二日那一周的…
Private, the week of 2 September...

1570
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:24,850
換崗記錄顯示 十六點以前你一直在三十九號哨崗
the switch log has you down at Post 39 until 1600.

1571
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:26,060
是這樣嗎？
Is that correct?

1572
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,100
是的，長官，記錄一直做得很準確
I'm sure it is, sir. They keep that log pretty good.

1573
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:32,770
三十九號哨崗離Ｗ連的營房有多遠？
How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward Barracks?

1574
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:36,320
有點距離，長官，得走一陣子
Well, it's a ways, sir. It's a hike.

1575
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,240
搭乘越野車要多久？
About how far by Jeep?

1576
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:42,660
他問這個幹什麼？ 十到十五分鐘，長官
About ten or fifteen minutes, sir.

1577
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:44,620
你曾步行過嗎？
You ever had to walk it?

1578
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:48,540
是的，長官 星期五那天，「臨時司機」…
Yes, sir. That day, Friday. The pickup private...

1579
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:51,670
我們都這麼叫負責接送我們的二等兵…
That's what we call the guy who drops us off and picks us up...

1580
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,960
同時也因為他能在「紐約城」泡到女孩子
also'cause he can get girls in New York City.

1581
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,130
他到三十九號哨的時候爆胎了
The pickup private got a flat, sir, right at 39.

1582
01:40:58,130 --> 01:41:01,050
他一停車，胎就爆了，又沒有備胎
He pulled up and, bam, blowout with no spare.

1583
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:03,140
所以我們只好跑步回營房
So we had to double-time it back to the barracks.

1584
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:06,930
既然越野車要花十到十五分鐘，我猜…
And if it's about ten or fifteen minutes by Jeep, I'm guessing...

1585
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:10,100
跑步至少要一個小時，對不對？
it must be a good hour by foot, am I right?

1586
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:13,270
他和我剛好用了四十五分鐘，長官
Pickup and me did it in 45 flat, sir.

1587
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,730
不錯啊
Not bad.

1588
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:19,610
你說你們去襲擊一等兵聖地亞哥…
You've said that your assault on Private Santiago...

1589
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:22,950
是因為肯德瑞克上尉十六點二十分時…
was a result of an order that Lieutenant Kendrick gave you...

1590
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:26,660
在你們的房間給你們下了命令，對不對？
in your barracks room at 1620, am I right?

1591
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:29,290
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

1592
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:33,250
但你剛才說十六點四十五分之前 你們還沒回到營房
But you just said that you didn't make it back to the barracks until 1645.

1593
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:39,920
既然十六點四十五分之前 你還沒回到營房…
Well, if you didn't make it back to the barracks until 1645...

1594
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,180
那十六點二十分你怎麼會在房間裡？
how could you be in your room at 1620?

1595
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:46,010
是這樣，長官，車胎爆了…
Well, you see, sir, there was a blowout...

1596
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:49,980
你有沒有親耳聽到 肯德瑞克上尉下令執行「紅色條規」？
Did you ever actually hear Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1597
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,770
哈羅德說…
Well, Hal said that...

1598
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:54,400
一等兵，你有沒有親耳聽到…
Private, did you ever actually hear...

1599
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,780
肯德瑞克上尉下令執行「紅色條規」？ 沒有，長官
Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1600
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:02,320
請求暫時休庭 我要和我的當事人交換意見
I'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client.

1601
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,700
你為什麼去聖地亞哥的房間？ 證人有他的權利
Why did you go into Santiago's room? The witness has rights!

1602
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:08,040
證人早就知道他的權利 重複一下剛才的問題
The witness has been read his rights. The question will be repeated.

1603
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,040
你為什麼去聖地亞哥的房間？ 哈羅德
Why did you go into Santiago's room?

1604
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:13,540
是道森要你去執行「紅色條規」嗎？ 哈羅德
Did Lance Corporal Dawson tell you to give Santiago a Code Red?

1605
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,330
不要看他 哈羅德
Don't look at him! Hal!

1606
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,380
回答上尉的問題
Answer the captaings question!

1607
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:26,430
長官，是我的班長，美國海軍 哈羅德-Ｗ-道森准下士給我的命令…
Yes, Captain, I was given an order by my squad leader... Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson, United States Marine Corps...

1608
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:27,720
所以我執行了
and I followed it.

1609
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,830
你說他會去哪？
Where do you think he is?

1610
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,870
對多尼而言，那就是肯德瑞克下的命令
As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order from Kendrick.

1611
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,920
是不是親耳聽到都一樣
It doesn't matter that he didn't hear it firsthand.

1612
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,090
他不會關心兩者之間的區別
He doesn't distinguish between the two.

1613
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,510
丹尼，我很抱歉
Danny, I'm sorry.

1614
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:09,970
不用擔心
Don't worry about it.

1615
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:12,640
山姆和我剛才談到我們應該…
Sam and I were just talking about how all we really have to do...

1616
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,560
找些能指認間接命令的證人
is call some witnesses who will talk about implied orders.

1617
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,230
在盤問道森之前讓多尼再次充當證人
Maybe we can put Downey back on the stand before we get to Dawson.

1618
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:23,690
照這樣幹下去 我們能讓道森為暗殺肯尼迪負責
If we work at it, we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination.

1619
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:28,030
你喝了酒？
Are you drunk?

1620
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:31,740
喝了不少
Pretty much.

1621
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:37,790
我去多弄點咖啡 我們今天要忙到很晚才行
I'll put on a pot of coffee. We've got a long night's work ahead.

1622
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:41,300
她要去弄咖啡
She's gonna make coffee.

1623
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,380
真不賴
That's nice.

1624
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:51,180
多尼當時不在房間裡
Downey wasn't in his room.

1625
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,140
根本不在
Wasn't even there.

1626
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,810
那是條非常重要的信息，你認為呢？
That was an important piece of information, don't you think?

1627
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:04,570
丹尼，這是個打擊，對此我很抱歉
Danny, it was a setback, and I'm sorry.

1628
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:07,320
但還能補救，我們有馬金森
But we fix it, and move on to Markinson.

1629
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,780
馬金森死了
Markinson's dead.

1630
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:20,710
你真得感謝那些聯邦密探，夥計
You really gotta hand it to those Federal Marshals, boy.

1631
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:23,460
他不是用自己的鞋帶上吊…
It's not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces...

1632
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:26,130
也不是用偷藏的黃油刀割腕
or slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife.

1633
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:27,590
這傢伙…
This guy...

1634
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:33,260
身著全套制服，站在房間的中央…
got into full dress uniform, stood in the middle of that room...

1635
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:36,480
從他的槍套裡拔出一支蹭亮的手槍…
drew a nickel-plated pistol from his holster...

1636
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,980
朝自己的嘴裡開了一槍
and fired a bullet into his mouth.

1637
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:46,740
既然我們已經沒有證人了 我想我該喝上一點
Anyway, since we seem to be out of witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little.

1638
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:48,990
我還是認為我們能贏
I still think we can win.

1639
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:52,620
或許你也該喝點
Maybe you should drink a little.

1640
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:57,750
我們明早去找倫道夫法官 要求押後二十四小時再審
We'll go to Randolph in the morning and make a motion for a 24-hour continuance.

1641
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:01,120
我們這樣做是為什麼？ 傳訊傑賽普上校
Why would we want to do that? To subpoena Colonel Jessup.

1642
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:05,000
什麼？ 別急，聽我說完
What? Listen for a second. Hear me out.

1643
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,090
我不想聽，更不想聽你說完
I won't listen, and I won't hear you out.

1644
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:09,470
勇氣可嘉，但毫無意義
Your passion is compelling, Jo. It's also useless.

1645
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:12,720
勞登·多尼今天需要一個庭審律師
Louden Downey needed a trial lawyer today.

1646
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:17,350
膽小鬼
You're chickenshit.

1647
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:20,230
你想用今天的事作借口認輸嗎？
You're gonna use what happened today as an excuse to give up.

1648
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,230
結束了
It's over.

1649
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:25,900
你幹嘛要向傑賽普要那份調令？
Why did you ask Jessup for the transfer order?

1650
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:28,610
為什麼？ 這有什麼？
In Cuba. Why? What does it matter?

1651
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:31,360
我想要那份該死的調令 胡說
I wanted the damn transfer order! Bullshit.

1652
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,910
想要的話在五角大樓任何部門都能找到
You could've gotten it by calling any department at the Pentagon.

1653
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:39,710
你不是想要那份調令 你是想看看傑賽普的反應
You didn't want the transfer order. You wanted to see Jessup's reaction.

1654
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:42,880
直覺告訴你有內情 而馬金森證實了這一點
You had an instinct, and it was confirmed by Markinson.

1655
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,880
我們要讓傑賽普出庭了結此事
Let's put Jessup on the stand and end this thing!

1656
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:50,090
讓傑賽普出庭又能有什麼好結果呢？
What possible good could come from putting Jessup on the stand?

1657
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,300
是他讓肯德瑞克下的「紅色條規」令
He told Kendrick to order the Code Red.

1658
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:56,430
是嗎？那太好了，你憑什麼這麼說？
He did? That's great! Why didn't you say so?

1659
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:58,770
顯然你能證明這一點
And of course you have proof of that!

1660
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:03,060
對不起，我忘了 你因病缺席了法律學校的法律課
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You were sick the day they taught law at law school.

1661
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,610
讓他出庭作證，讓他自己說出來
You put him on the stand, and you get it from him.

1662
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:09,740
讓他自己說出來，是啊，沒問題
Oh, we get it from him! Yes! No problem!

1663
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:13,610
傑賽普上校，是不是你 下令對聖地亞哥執行「紅色條規」？
Colonel Jessup, isn't it true that you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

1664
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:16,830
聽著，我們都有點… 對不起，時間到
Listen, we're all a little... I'm sorry. Your time's run out.

1665
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:20,000
該怎麼打發輸家呢？讓我們的被告…
What do we have for the losers? Well, for our defendants...

1666
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,410
在萊文沃斯堡（監獄）休養一輩子
it's a lifetime at exotic Fort Leavenworth.

1667
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:25,460
至於辯護律師凱菲中尉…
And for Defense Counsel Kaffee...

1668
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,290
讓他上軍事法庭
it's a court-martial!

1669
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,590
沒錯，夥計，因為共謀及作偽證…
Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing...

1670
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:34,890
無端指控一名功勳卓著的海軍軍官…
a highly decorated Marine officer... of conspiracy and perjury...

1671
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:38,100
凱菲中尉會有一份美好的前途…
Lieutenant Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career...

1672
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:43,440
去沃克科洛布女子學校 執教打字機維修
teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocco Clubo School for Women.

1673
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:49,690
謝謝你參與 「我們該不該聽從笨蛋的勸告？」的演出
Thank you for playing "Should we or should we not... follow the advice of the galactically stupid?"

1674
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:14,630
很抱歉我毀了你的大好前程
I'm sorry I lost your set of steak knives.

1675
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:33,530
別收拾了
Stop cleaning up.

1676
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,660
山姆，別收拾了
Stop cleaning up.

1677
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:52,130
想喝點嗎？
Want a drink? Yeah.

1678
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:13,360
你父親以你為榮嗎？ 別給自己太多壓力
Is your father proud of you? Don't do this to yourself.

1679
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,150
我敢說一定是
I'll bet he is.

1680
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:19,320
我打賭他會不厭其煩地對鄰居和親戚說…
I'll bet he bores the shit out of the neighbors and relatives.

1681
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,870
山姆上了'法律評論'欄目 他接了個大案子
"Sam's made LawReview. He's got a big case he's making.

1682
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:27,080
他上庭了，正在為一個案子作辯護律師
He's arguing. He's making an argument."

1683
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:36,880
我父親一定很高興看到我從法律學校畢業
I think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school.

1684
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:43,010
他一定為此欣喜若狂
I think he would've liked that an awful lot.

1685
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:51,020
我有沒有告訴過你 我在學校時寫過一篇關於你父親的論文？
Did I ever tell you I wrote a paper about your father in college? Yeah?

1686
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:53,730
他是有史以來最好的律師之一
One of the best trial lawyers ever.

1687
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:57,110
是的，的確是
Yes, he was.

1688
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:59,490
如果我是道森和多尼…
If I were Dawson and Downey and I had a choice...

1689
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:02,530
要從你和你父親當中選代表律師的話…
between you or your father to represent me in this case...

1690
01:49:02,530 --> 01:49:05,580
不管什麼時候我都會選你
I'd choose you any day of the week and twice on Sunday.

1691
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:09,120
要知道你把肯德瑞克給鎮住了
You should've seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick.

1692
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,090
你會讓傑賽普出庭嗎？
Would you put Jessup on the stand?

1693
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:16,170
不會
No

1694
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,300
你覺得我父親會這樣做嗎？ 以我們掌握的證據而言嗎？
Do you think my father would have? With the evidence we got?

1695
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:25,260
絕對不會
Not in a million years.

1696
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:28,730
但問題是…現在所有的人都知道…
But here's the thing... and there's really know way of getting around this...

1697
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:33,110
既不是你父親也不是我 在擔任首席辯護律師來處理…
Neither Lyle Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel for the defense...

1698
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:36,320
這起政府起訴道森和多尼的案子
in the matter of U... S. V. Dawson and Downey.

1699
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:40,400
所以唯一的問題就是…你會怎麼做？
So there's really only one question... What would you do?

1700
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:56,460
喬，上車，喬安妮，求你上車吧
Jo, get in the car. Joanne, please get in the car.

1701
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:57,920
聽我說…
Look...

1702
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:05,760
我很抱歉衝你發火，我為我說的話道歉
I apologize. I was angry. I'm sorry about what I said.

1703
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,430
我會讓傑賽普出庭作證
I'm gonna put Jessup on the stand.

1704
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:30,330
你覺得我們該怎麼做？
What do you suggest we do?

1705
01:50:30,330 --> 01:50:32,580
證明傑賽普偽造了調令
I say we hit Jessup with the phony transfer order.

1706
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,580
上哪去找證人？
What's a transfer order without a witness?

1707
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:36,250
我們有證人 已經死了
We have a witness. A dead witness.

1708
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:39,250
對一個次席律師來說這確實是個問題
In the hands of a lesser attorney, that would be a problem.

1709
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:41,800
瞧瞧吧，昨晚他還在借酒消愁…
Look at this. Last night he's swimming in Jack Daniels...

1710
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:44,590
現在卻無所不能了
and now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound.

1711
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:47,850
我又上好發條了，你們都坐好
I'm getting my second wind. Sit down, both of you.

1712
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:52,480
很好，傑賽普讓肯德瑞克 下「紅色條規」令，肯德瑞克照做了
Good. Jessup told Kendrick to order the Code Red. Kendrick did.

1713
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,770
當事人執行了命令，這我們無法證實
Our clients followed the order. The cover-up isn't our case.

1714
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:59,480
要贏的話，得讓傑賽普 告訴陪審團是他下的「紅色條規」令
To win, Jessup needs to tell the court members that he ordered the Code Red.

1715
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:03,280
你覺得你能讓他說出來嗎？ 我覺得他想說出來
You think you can get him to say it? I think he wants to say it.

1716
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,610
他肯定因為不能說出來而惱火
I think he's pissed off that he's got to hide from us.

1717
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:09,200
他想說出是他作的決定 這樣事情就能解決
I think he wants to say that he made a command decision, and that's the end.

1718
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,200
他吃早餐時三百碼外…
He eats breakfast 300 yards away...

1719
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:15,540
有四千名訓練有素的古巴人想幹掉他
from 4,000 Cubans that are trained to kill him.

1720
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,670
沒人能干涉他帶兵的方式
No one's gonna tell him how to run his unit.

1721
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:20,630
至少穿著娘娘腔制服的「哈佛嘴」不能
Least of all the Harvard mouth in his faggotywhite uniform.

1722
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:22,800
我得激怒他，讓他進行反擊…
I need to shake him, put him on the defensive...

1723
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:25,590
然後領著他自掘墳墓
and lead him right where he's dying to go.

1724
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:28,640
就這樣？這就是計劃？ 這就是計劃
That's it? That's the plan? That's the plan.

1725
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:31,890
你打算怎麼做？ 還沒頭緒
How are you gonna do it? I have no idea.

1726
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:34,100
我需要我的球棒 需要什麼？
I need my bat. Your what?

1727
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:36,440
拿著球棒我的思路更敏捷，它在哪？
I think better with my bat. Where's my bat?

1728
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,980
我把它放在壁櫥裡了 你把它放在壁櫥裡了？
I put it in the closet. You put it in the closet?

1729
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:43,940
我被它絆了一下 永遠別把它放到壁櫥裡
I was tripping on it. Don't ever put that bat in the closet.

1730
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:47,870
拿著球棒能讓他思路更敏捷？ 我能理解
He thinks better with his bat? I can understand that.

1731
01:51:59,210 --> 01:52:02,210
呆在這，我去趟辦公室
Stay here. I'm going to the office for a while.

1732
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:07,340
拿著球棒確實能給他靈感
He does think better with that bat.

1733
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,560
古巴關達那摩灣 打出電話記錄

1734
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:33,200
山姆，我要你替我辦件事
Sam, I need you to do something for me.

1735
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:39,630
怎麼了？ 得去趟安德魯斯
What's going on? Gotta go out to Andrews.

1736
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,400
山姆呢？ 還在路上
Where's Sam? He's on his way.

1737
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,400
他找到人沒有？ 找到了
Did he get the guys? Yeah.

1738
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:10,490
能和你聊幾句嗎？
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?

1739
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,780
當然，沒問題
Oh, yeah, sure.

1740
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:24,840
你感覺怎麼樣？
How you feeling?

1741
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:29,880
我看傑賽普今天要舉手投降了
Well, I think Jessup's gonna have his hands full today.

1742
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:34,510
聽我說，丹尼…
Listen, Danny...

1743
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,140
你今天上去的時候…
when you're out there today...

1744
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:41,350
如果感覺計劃不能成功…
if you feel like it's not gonna happen...

1745
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:44,570
如果你覺得他不會說出來…
if you feel like he's not gonna say it...

1746
01:53:44,570 --> 01:53:46,190
就別勉強行事
don't go for it.

1747
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:49,990
不然你會惹上麻煩
You could get in trouble.

1748
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:52,110
我是內政部的特別律師…
I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs...

1749
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,780
我知道那會惹來多少麻煩
and I'm telling you you could get in a lot of trouble.

1750
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:56,830
等等，蓋洛維少校…
Wait, Lieutenant Commander Galloway...

1751
01:53:56,870 --> 01:54:01,160
你不是在奉勸我放棄這個重要證人吧？
you're not suggesting that I back off a material witness?

1752
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:04,460
如果你覺得不能引他上鉤的話，是的
If you think you can't get him, yeah.

1753
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:08,300
全體起立
All rise.

1754
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:16,180
山姆呢？ 就快到了
Where's Sam? He's on his way.

1755
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:24,400
傳第一位證人 他在哪？
Call your first witness. Where is he?

1756
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,770
他會來的 中尉
He'll be here. Lieutenant.

1757
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:28,480
傳你的證人
Call your witness.

1758
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:37,870
辯方傳喚內森·傑賽普上校
Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessup.

1759
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:57,470
傑賽普上校，請舉起你的右手，長官
Colonel Jessup, would you raise your right hand please, sir?

1760
01:54:57,470 --> 01:55:01,020
你能發誓你在法庭上所說的一切…
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this court-martial...

1761
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:04,520
完全屬實，絕無虛假嗎？
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1762
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,940
我發誓
Yes, I do.

1763
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:07,480
請坐下，長官
Have a seat please, sir.

1764
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:12,610
請說出你的姓名，軍銜和現任職務 以便法庭記錄
Would you state your name, rank and current billet for the record, sir?

1765
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:15,820
內森·Ｒ·傑賽普，上校…
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup, commanding officer...

1766
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:19,200
古巴關達那摩灣 美國海軍陸戰隊指揮官
Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1767
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:21,580
謝謝，長官 他還沒來
Thank you, sir. He's not here.

1768
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:30,960
上校，你得知聖地亞哥 寫給海軍調查處的那封信時…
Colonel, when you learned of Santiago's letter to the N.I. S...

1769
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,170
曾和你手下兩位高級軍官開過會
you had a meeting with your two senior officers.

1770
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:36,300
是這樣嗎？ 是的
Is that right? Yes.

1771
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:39,970
是排長喬納森·肯德瑞克上尉…
The platoon commander, Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

1772
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:43,730
和行政長官馬修·馬金森中校嗎？
and the executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

1773
01:55:43,730 --> 01:55:45,270
是的
Yes.

1774
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:49,900
現在馬金森中校已經死了，是這樣嗎？
And at present Colonel Markinson is dead. Is that right?

1775
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:54,030
反對，不知辯方律師這是什麼意思
Objection. I'd like to know just what the defense counsel is implying.

1776
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:57,530
意思很簡單，就是馬金森中校已經死了
I'm implying simply that at present Colonel Markinson is not alive.

1777
01:55:57,530 --> 01:56:01,330
傑賽普上校 用不著在法庭上確認這個消息
Colonel Jessup doesn't need to appear in court to confirm that information.

1778
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:06,710
我是想確認證人是否知道兩天前 中校用一支點四五手槍自盡了
I just wasn't sure the witness was aware that two days ago... the colonel took his own life with a.45-caliber pistol.

1779
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:09,250
證人知道了，法庭知道了…
The witness is aware, the court is aware...

1780
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:11,250
現在陪審團也知道了
and now the court members are aware.

1781
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:14,880
謝謝你為我們帶來這個消息
We thank you for bringing this to our attention.

1782
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,680
繼續吧，中尉
Move on, Lieutenant...

1783
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:18,510
好的，法官大人
Yes, sir.

1784
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:22,220
上校，你在會上 給肯德瑞克上尉下過命令是嗎？
Colonel, you gave Lieutenant Kendrick an order at this meeting, right?

1785
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:26,640
我讓肯德瑞克告訴他的手下 不許碰聖地亞哥
I told Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1786
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:29,650
你是不是也給馬金森中校下過命令？
And did you give an order to Colonel Markinson as well?

1787
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:35,240
我命令馬金森立刻將聖地亞哥調離基地
I ordered Markinson to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately.

1788
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,070
為什麼？
Why?

1789
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:40,950
我擔心一旦信的內容洩露出去 他可能會有生命危險
I felt his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out.

1790
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:42,410
致命的危險？
Grave danger?

1791
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:44,700
還能是什麼？
Is there another kind?

1792
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:52,250
上校，這是你和馬金森聯合簽名的調令…
Colonel, we have the transfer order that you and Markinson co-signed...

1793
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:56,970
命令聖地亞哥乘第二天凌晨六點的航班 離開關達那摩
ordering that Santiago be on a flight leaving Guantanamo at 6:00 the next day.

1794
01:56:56,970 --> 01:57:02,260
那是最早的航班嗎？ 六點是最早飛離基地的航班
Was that the first flight? The 0600 was the first flight.

1795
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:09,390
你是今早乘飛機來華盛頓的對嗎？
You flew up to Washington this morning. Is that right?

1796
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:12,860
我注意到你今天是穿著高級制服上的法庭
I notice you'rewearing your class "A" dress uniform in court today.

1797
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:16,110
彼此彼此，中尉 你在飛機上也是這身穿著嗎？
As are you, Lieutenant. Did you wear that on the plane?

1798
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:18,990
法官大人，這與本案有什麼關…
Please the court, is this dialogue relevant to anything...

1799
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:21,740
辯方難得有機會請這位證人作證
Defense didn't have the opportunity to depose this witness.

1800
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:25,580
我想多問幾個問題 請注意提問範圍
I'd ask for a little latitude. A very little latitude.

1801
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,160
上校？
Colonel?

1802
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,790
我在飛機上穿的是便服
I wore utilities on the plane.

1803
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:32,920
不過你帶著軍裝是吧？ 是的
You brought your dress uniform? Yes.

1804
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:36,420
那麼牙刷，剃鬚刀，內衣呢？ 法官大人…
Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear? Your Honor!

1805
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,840
難道上校的內衣也是國家機密嗎？
Is the colonel's underwear a matter of national security?

1806
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:42,300
兩位，你最好盡快問完這些，中尉
Gentlemen! You better get somewhere fast with this, Lieutenant.

1807
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:44,430
是，大人，上校？
Yes, sir. Colonel?

1808
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:49,270
我帶了一套替換衣服和一些私人用品
I brought a change of clothes and some personal items.

1809
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:51,190
謝謝
Thank you.

1810
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:54,940
道森和多尼在六號晚上被拘捕後…
After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the sixth...

1811
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:59,280
聖地亞哥的房間就被封了 這是房內的物品清單
Santiago's barracks were sealed off and its contents inventoried.

1812
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:02,660
四條迷彩褲，三件卡其襯衣…
"Four pairs camouflage pants, three long-sleeve khaki shirts...

1813
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:06,620
三雙靴子，四雙軍襪，三件軍用Ｔ恤…
three pairs of boots, four pairs green socks, three green T-shirts..."

1814
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,620
法官大人，我們要一直這麼問下去嗎？
Please the court, is there a question anywhere in our future?

1815
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:12,830
凱菲中尉，我得要求你提出你的問題
Lieutenant Kaffee, I have to ask you to state your question.

1816
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:15,710
為什麼聖地亞哥沒有收拾行李？
I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed.

1817
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:21,090
我稍後會告訴大家，先來看看這個
I'll tell you what. We'll get back to that one in a minute.

1818
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:25,300
這是過去二十四小時 從你們基地打出的所有電話記錄
This is a record of all phone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours.

1819
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:28,970
在被傳喚來華盛頓之後，你打過三個電話
After being subpoenaed to Washington, you made three calls.

1820
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:31,350
你熟悉這些號碼嗎？
Do you recognize those number, sir?

1821
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:34,560
一個打給維州匡迪科基地的菲茨上校
I called Colonel Fitzhughes in Quantico, Virginia.

1822
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,440
讓他知道我要來這
I wanted to let him know that I would be in town.

1823
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,070
第二個是打給眾議院軍事委員會 的裡奇蒙德議員…
The second call was to arrange a meeting with Congressman Richmond...

1824
01:58:41,070 --> 01:58:43,410
和他商量見一下面
of the House Armed Services Committee.

1825
01:58:43,410 --> 01:58:46,530
第三個是打給我妹妹伊莉莎白
And the third call was to my sister Elizabeth.

1826
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:48,700
為什麼要打這個電話，長官？
Why did you make that call, sir?

1827
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:52,160
我想請她今晚一起吃晚飯
I thought she might like to have dinner tonight.

1828
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:55,630
我會制止的 這些是九月六日從關達那摩…
I'm gonna stop this. These are phone records from Gitmo...

1829
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:59,920
打出的電話記錄，而這是聖地亞哥…
for September 6, and these are 14 letters...

1830
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,720
在九個月內寫的十四封信…
that Santiago wrote in nine months...

1831
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:05,970
請求…事實上是乞求…調離
requesting... in fact, begging... for a transfer.

1832
01:59:05,970 --> 01:59:09,220
在得知終於被允許調離的消息之後…
Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer...

1833
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:13,270
聖地亞哥非常興奮 知道他給多少人打過電話嗎？
Santiago was so excited that do you know how many people he called?

1834
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:15,810
沒給任何人打過
Zero. Nobody.

1835
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:19,730
沒有一個電話告知他的父母他要回家了
Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home.

1836
01:59:19,730 --> 01:59:23,030
沒有一個電話打給朋友說 「你能來機場接我嗎」
Not one call to a friend, saying, "Can you pick me up at the airport?"

1837
01:59:23,030 --> 01:59:26,950
半夜時他在床上睡著了，依你所說…
He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you...

1838
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:29,540
他六小時後就要上飛機
he was getting on a plane in six hours.

1839
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:33,210
可他所有的東西 還整整齊齊地放在壁櫥裡…
Yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet...

1840
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:35,870
整整齊齊地疊放在扁條箱裡
and folded neatly in his footlocker.

1841
01:59:35,870 --> 01:59:39,710
你只離開一天 就收拾了行李並打了三個電話
You were leaving for one day. You packed a bag and made three calls.

1842
01:59:39,710 --> 01:59:44,220
而聖地亞哥離開後這輩子都不會再回來…
Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life...

1843
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,680
但他沒打一個電話…
and he hadn't called a soul...

1844
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:51,430
沒收拾一件物品
and he hadn't packed a thing.

1845
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,400
這你能解釋嗎？
Can you explain that?

1846
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:01,190
事實是根本沒有調令
The fact is, there was no transfer order.

1847
02:00:01,190 --> 02:00:04,030
聖地亞哥哪都不會去，是不是，上校？
Santiago wasn't going anywhere. Isn't that right, Colonel?

1848
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:07,570
反對，法官大人，顯然凱菲中尉意圖…
Objection. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lieutenant Kaffee's intention...

1849
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:09,950
誹謗一位高級海軍軍官…
is the smear a high-ranking Marine officer...

1850
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:13,700
希望以這種無禮的舉動來達到他的目的
in the hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points.

1851
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:17,710
大人，我請求對凱菲中尉予以懲戒…
It's my recommendation, sir, that Lieutenant Kaffee be reprimanded...

1852
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:20,670
以此向證人表示法庭最誠懇的歉意
and the witness be excused with the court's deepest apologies.

1853
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:25,630
駁回請求… 你的反對已記入筆錄
Overruled. Your objection is noted.

1854
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:27,720
上校？
Colonel?

1855
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,850
很可笑嗎，長官？
Is this funny, sir?

1856
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:37,270
不，不是可笑，是可悲
No, it's not. It's tragic.

1857
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:40,060
可以回答嗎？ 當然
Do you have an answer? Absolutely.

1858
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:43,940
我得說，我沒有這見鬼的第一線索
My answer is, I don't have the first damn clue.

1859
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:47,780
也許他習慣早起，願意在早上收拾行李
Maybe he was an early riser and liked to pack in the morning.

1860
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:50,660
也許他根本沒什麼朋友
And maybe he didn't have any friends.

1861
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:54,240
我是受過教育，但我恐怕答不出…
I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently...

1862
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:57,960
關於威廉·聖地亞哥出行習慣的智力題
about the travel habits of William Santiago.

1863
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:03,170
我只知道他已經被安排在六點離開基地
What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600.

1864
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:09,050
現在，難道叫我到這來 就是為了回答這些問題嗎？
Now, are these really the questions that I was called here to answer?

1865
02:01:09,050 --> 02:01:11,470
電話以及扁條箱？
Phone calls and footlockers?

1866
02:01:11,470 --> 02:01:15,270
請告訴我你還想知道些什麼，中尉
Please tell me that you have something more, Lieutenant.

1867
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:19,100
這次審判將決定兩名陸戰隊員的命運
These two Marines are on trial for their lives.

1868
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:23,690
請告訴我他們的律師 不會將希望寄托在電話清單上
Please tell me that their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.

1869
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:29,570
你還有其他問題要問嗎，律師？
Do you have any other questions for me, counselor?

1870
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,160
凱菲中尉？
Lieutenant Kaffee?

1871
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:51,890
中尉，你還有什麼問題要問證人嗎？
Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness?

1872
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:01,600
謝謝，丹尼，我喜歡華盛頓
Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.

1873
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,270
抱歉，我還沒讓你走呢
Excuse me. I didn't dismiss you.

1874
02:02:05,270 --> 02:02:07,070
你說什麼？
I beg your pardon?

1875
02:02:07,110 --> 02:02:11,780
我的盤問還沒有結束，坐下
I'm not through with my examination. Sit down.

1876
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:16,200
上校 什麼意思？
Colonel. What's that?

1877
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,910
你該稱呼我 「上校」 或 「長官」
I'd appreciate it if you'd address me as "colonel" or "sir."

1878
02:02:18,910 --> 02:02:20,540
這是我應得的尊重
I believe I've earned it.

1879
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:24,880
辯方律師應該稱呼證人 「上校」 或 「長官」
Defense counsel will address the witness as "colonel" or "sir."

1880
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,920
我不知道你管理的是什麼鬼單位
I don't know what the hell kind of unit you're running here.

1881
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:31,800
證人應該稱呼法官 「法官大人」 或者 「庭上」
The witness will address this court as "judge" or "your honor."

1882
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:36,720
我很肯定這是我應得的尊重 請坐，上校
I'm quite certain I've earned it. Take your seat, Colonel.

1883
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,730
你現在想討論什麼？我最喜歡的顏色嗎？
What do you want to discuss now? My favorite color?

1884
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:49,650
上校，最早離開基地的航班是在六點嗎？
Colonel, the 6:00 a.m. Flight was the first one off the base?

1885
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:50,740
是的
Yes.

1886
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:52,910
沒有航班在七小時前離開…
There wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier...

1887
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:55,320
並於凌晨兩點降落在安德魯斯嗎？
and landed at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 a. M?

1888
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:58,370
中尉，我們不是問過這個問題了嗎？
Lieutenant, I think we've covered this, haven't we?

1889
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:01,500
法官大人，這些是…
Your Honor, these are the tower chiefs logs...

1890
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:04,420
關達那摩和安德魯斯指揮塔的飛行日誌
for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Air Force Base.

1891
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:07,880
關達那摩沒有航班在二十三點離開的記錄
The Guantanamo log lists no flight that left at 11:00 p.m.

1892
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,550
安德魯斯也沒有航班在兩點降落的記錄
The Andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2:00 a.m.

1893
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:13,220
辯方希望能從兩個基地得到證實
I'd like to admit them as defense exhibits Alpha and Bravo.

1894
02:03:13,930 --> 02:03:17,510
什麼意思？ 你想證實一趟從沒有過的航班嗎？
I don't understand. You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed.

1895
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:20,060
我們相信有，大人
We believe it did, sir.

1896
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:23,440
辯方請求傳空軍 奧馬雷和羅德瑞格作證
Defense will be calling Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Rodriguez.

1897
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:26,520
他們是七號兩點種時當班的地勤人員
They were working the ground crew at Andrews at 2:00 a.m. On the 7th.

1898
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:29,440
他們不在證人名單上 第三度答辯證人…
These men weren't on the list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor...

1899
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,820
是特許被傳喚 在直接盤問下提供證詞的
called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination.

1900
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:36,870
請求通過 真是荒謬
I'll allow the witnesses. This is ridiculous.

1901
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:41,410
上校，剛才… 看在上帝份上，查查指揮塔的飛行日誌吧
Colonel, a moment ago... Check the tower logs, for God's sake!

1902
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:44,500
現在有空軍可以證實，長官
We'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir.

1903
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:47,460
你剛才說曾命令肯德瑞克…
A moment ago you said that you ordered Lieutenant Kendrick...

1904
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:51,590
告訴他的手下不許碰聖地亞哥
to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1905
02:03:51,590 --> 02:03:53,170
沒錯
That's right.

1906
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:56,010
但他是不是清楚你的命令？
And Lieutenant Kendrick was clear on what you wanted?

1907
02:03:56,010 --> 02:03:57,840
完全清楚
Crystal.

1908
02:03:57,890 --> 02:04:01,100
他有沒有可能忽視這個命令？
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick ignored the order?

1909
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:03,140
忽視這個命令？
Ignored the order?

1910
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:06,310
他有沒有可能忘記呢？ 不
Any chance he forgot about it?

1911
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:10,120
有沒有可能他離開你的辦公室後說 「老頭子錯了」呢？
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick left your office and said, "The old man is wrong"?

1912
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:11,950
不
No

1913
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,820
當肯德瑞克上尉告訴手下…
When Lieutenant Kendrick spoke to the platoon...

1914
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:18,200
不許碰聖地亞哥時 他們有沒有可能當成耳邊風？
and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him?

1915
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:22,620
你曾在步兵團服過役嗎，小子？
You ever served in an infantry unit, son?

1916
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:26,000
沒有，長官 曾經上過前線嗎？
No, sir. Ever served in a forward area?

1917
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:30,340
沒有，長官 有沒有把性命交給過別人…
Ever put your life in another man's hands?

1918
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:33,800
或讓別人把性命托付給你？ 沒有，長官
Asked him to put his life in yours?

1919
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:36,260
我們要服從命令，小子
We follow orders, son.

1920
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:39,340
得服從命令，不然就會出人命
We follow orders, or people die.

1921
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:42,560
就這麼簡單，聽明白了嗎？
It's that simple. Are we clear?

1922
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,430
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

1923
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:46,230
聽明白沒有？
Are we clear?

1924
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:48,270
完全明白
Crystal.

1925
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:55,070
在我盤問奧馬雷和羅德瑞格之前 還有個問題
I have just one more question before I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez.

1926
02:04:56,240 --> 02:05:00,570
既然你下了命令不許碰聖地亞哥…
If you gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched...

1927
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:03,200
而你的命令總是能得到遵從…
and your orders are always followed...

1928
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:08,290
那聖地亞哥為什麼會有危險？
then why would Santiago be in danger?

1929
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:13,960
為什麼他必須被調離基地呢？
Why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?

1930
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:22,640
聖地亞哥是一名不合格的陸戰隊員
Santiago was a substandard Marine.

1931
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:25,100
他被調走… 你剛才可沒這樣說
He was being transferred... That's not what you said!

1932
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:28,810
你說要調走他是因為他有生命危險 是的
You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger.

1933
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:31,810
我說 「致命的危險嗎？」 你說 「還能是什麼？」
I said, "Grave danger?" You said, "Is there any other kind?"

1934
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:34,400
我記得我說過什麼 我可以念給你聽
I recall what I said. I can have it read back to you.

1935
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:37,490
我知道我說過什麼，用不著念給我聽
I know what I said! I don't have to have it read back to me.

1936
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:41,200
那為什麼有兩項命令？上校？
Then why the two orders? Colonel?

1937
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:45,790
有時候那些手下會自作主張
Sometimes men take matters into their own hands.

1938
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:48,960
你說得很清楚，你的部下決不會自作主張
You've made it clear that your men never take matters into their own hands.

1939
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,000
他們得服從命令，否則會出人命
Your men follow orders, or people die.

1940
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,710
那聖地亞哥應不應該有危險呢？
So Santiago should have been in danger, should he?

1941
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:57,630
你這個無禮的小雜種 大人，我請求休庭
You snotty little bastard. I'd like to ask for a recess.

1942
02:05:57,630 --> 02:06:01,390
我要求證人回答這個問題 請證人回答問題
I'd like an answer to the question. The court will wait for an answer.

1943
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:04,510
既然肯德瑞克曾經下令…
If Lieutenant Kendrick gave an order...

1944
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:07,560
不許碰聖地亞哥…
that Santiago wasn't to be touched...

1945
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,520
那他為什麼非得調走？
then why did he have to be transferred?

1946
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:11,810
上校？
Colonel?

1947
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:16,650
肯德瑞克下「紅色條規」令 是因為你授意他那樣去做
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered the Code Red because that's what you told him to do!

1948
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:19,740
反對 然後你卻讓他們做替罪羊
Object! And then you cut these guys loose!

1949
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:23,370
我要告你藐視法庭 你還竄改了飛行日誌
I'll hold you in contempt. You doctored the logbook!

1950
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:26,290
該死的，凱菲 是你在藐視法庭
Damn it, Kaffee! Consider yourself in contempt.

1951
02:06:26,290 --> 02:06:29,160
傑賽普上校 是你下的「紅色條規」令嗎？
Colonel Jessup, did you order the Code Red?

1952
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:32,790
你不必回答這個問題 我要回答
You don't have to answer that. I'll answer the question.

1953
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:34,880
你想要答案？ 我有這個權利
You want answers? I think I'm entitled!

1954
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:37,380
你想知道答案？ 我想知道事實
You want answers? I want the truth!

1955
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:40,550
你受不了這個事實
You can't handle the truth!

1956
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:45,300
小子，我們生活的世界 需要有人手持武器來守衛邊疆
Son, we live in a world that has walls... and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns.

1957
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:49,770
誰來守衛？是你？ 還是你，溫伯格中尉？
Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg?

1958
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:53,810
我的責任比你們能想像到的要重要得多
I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.

1959
02:06:53,810 --> 02:06:57,360
你為聖地亞哥抱屈 卻來折騰這些海軍陸戰隊員
You weep for Santiago, and you curse the Marines.

1960
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:01,280
你有幸不必知道我知道的事…
You have the luxury of not knowing what I know...

1961
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:05,450
聖地亞哥的死固然是個悲劇 但可能拯救了更多的性命
that Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives.

1962
02:07:05,450 --> 02:07:11,410
至於我的存在方式，對你來說是怪異 和不可理解的，但卻是在拯救生命
And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives!

1963
02:07:11,410 --> 02:07:15,630
你不想面對這個事實 是因為你未曾提起的潛意識裡…
You don't want the truth because deep down you don't talk about...

1964
02:07:15,630 --> 02:07:17,840
你需要我來保家衛國
you want me on that wall.

1965
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,630
你需要我來保家衛國
You need me on that wall!

1966
02:07:20,630 --> 02:07:25,340
我們慣用的詞語是尊嚴，軍規，忠誠
We use words like honor, code, loyalty.

1967
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:29,140
對這些詞語我們不惜用生命來捍衛
We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something.

1968
02:07:29,140 --> 02:07:31,180
你們卻拿來當兒戲
You use them as a punch line.

1969
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:35,100
我既沒有時間也沒有興趣 向你這種人作解釋
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself...

1970
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:39,360
你在我提供的自由被褥下高枕無憂 卻反過來質疑…
to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the freedom I provide...

1971
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:42,280
我提供自由的方式
and then questions the manner in which I provide it!

1972
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:45,610
我看你最好是說聲謝謝然後滾到一邊去
I would rather you just said thank you and went on your way.

1973
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:49,450
否則，我建議你拿上武器去站崗
Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post.

1974
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:54,410
不然休想我給你 你自以為該有的什麼鬼權利
Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to!

1975
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:56,120
是你下的「紅色條規」令嗎？
Did you order the Code Red?

1976
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:58,130
我身負重任… 是你下的命令嗎？
I did the job... Did you order the Code Red?

1977
02:07:58,170 --> 02:08:00,550
該死的，沒錯，是我
You're goddamned right I did!

1978
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:14,730
法官大人，我提議讓陪審團迴避…
Please the court, I suggest the members be dismissed...

1979
02:08:14,730 --> 02:08:18,020
然後直接依據39-Ａ條款開庭
so that we can move to an immediate Article 39-A session.

1980
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:20,520
這是證人的權利
The witness has rights.

1981
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:22,820
羅斯上尉？
Captain Ross?

1982
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:28,030
傑克？
Jack?

1983
02:08:33,620 --> 02:08:37,370
請陪審團到休息室等候進一步指示
The members of the court will retire to an anteroom until further instructed.

1984
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:39,210
全體起立
All rise.

1985
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:43,960
到底怎麼回事？上校，怎麼回事？
What the hell is this? Colonel, what's going on?

1986
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,550
我是履行職責，以後也會這樣做
I did my job. I'd do it again.

1987
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:49,760
我得趕飛機回我的基地了
I'm gonna get on a plane and go on back to my base.

1988
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:53,560
你哪都不能去，上校 憲兵，保護好上校
You're not going anywhere, Colonel. M.P. S, guard the colonel.

1989
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:55,020
是，長官
Yes, sir.

1990
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:59,610
羅斯上尉 這是搞什麼鬼？
Captain Ross. What the hell is this?

1991
02:08:59,610 --> 02:09:02,610
傑賽普上校，你有權保持沉默
Colonel Jessup, you have the right to remain silent.

1992
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:07,280
是指控我有罪嗎？我犯了什麼罪？
I'm being charged with a crime? Is that what this is?

1993
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:10,700
我被指控有罪嗎？ 你有權找一位律師
I'm being charged with a crime? You have a right to consult a lawyer.

1994
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:14,620
荒謬，真是荒謬 你可以自已指定一名律師
This is funny. That's what this is. This lawyer may be appointed by you.

1995
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:18,370
我要挖出你的眼睛，用你的頭骨當便壺
I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your head and piss in your dead skull!

1996
02:09:18,370 --> 02:09:20,380
你毀了海軍陸戰隊
You fucked with the wrong Marine!

1997
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:23,880
傑賽普上校 你明白我剛才宣讀的權利了嗎？
Colonel Jessup, do you understand these rights as I have just read them?

1998
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:32,850
你們這些混蛋
You fucking people.

1999
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:35,680
你們不知道怎樣保家衛國
You have no idea how to defend a nation.

2000
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:39,190
你今天的作為只會危害到國家，凱菲
All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee.

2001
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:41,230
這就是你幹的好事
That's all you did.

2002
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:46,440
你將人民的生命置於危險之中 做你的美夢去吧，小子
You put people's lives in danger. Sweet dreams, son.

2003
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:48,650
別叫我小子
Don't call me son.

2004
02:09:48,650 --> 02:09:53,160
我是美國海軍中的一名律師和軍官…
I'm a lawyer and an officer in the United States Navy...

2005
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:56,040
你被逮捕了，狗娘養的
and you're under arrest, you son of a bitch.

2006
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:02,250
證人可以退下了
The witness is excused.

2007
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:25,400
全體起立
All rise.

2008
02:10:36,910 --> 02:10:38,580
陪審團有結果了嗎？
Have the members reached a verdict?

2009
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:40,620
是的，大人
We have, sir.

2010
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:55,970
道森准下士和一等兵多尼
Lance Corporal Dawson and Private First Class Downey.

2011
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:03,440
謀殺罪名，陪審團認為該項指控…
On the charge of murder, the members find the accused...

2012
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:05,440

共謀謀殺罪名…
On the charge of conspiracy to commit murder...

2014

陪審團認為該項指控罪名不成立
the members find the accused not guilty.

2015
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:20,580
對一名海軍陸戰隊員行為不當罪名…

2016
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:26,630
陪審團認為該項指控罪名成立
the members find the accused guilty as charged.

2017
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:31,590

The accused are hereby sentenced to time already served...

2018
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:36,640
並勒令從海軍陸戰隊不榮譽解職
and you are ordered to be dishonorably discharged from the Marine Corps.

2019
02:11:37,890 --> 02:11:40,020
現在宣佈退庭
This court-martial is adjourned.

2020
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:41,980
全體起立
All rise.

2021
02:11:57,780 --> 02:11:59,790
那是什麼意思？
What does that mean?

2022
02:12:01,790 --> 02:12:02,700
哈羅德
Harold

2023
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:06,880
那是什麼意思？
What did that mean?

2024
02:12:10,130 --> 02:12:14,420
我沒明白，傑賽普上校都說了 是他下的「紅色條規」令
I don't understand. Colonel Jessup said he ordered the Code Red.

2025
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:18,430
我知道 他都承認了，我們沒做錯什麼
I know. What did we do wrong?

2026
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:22,020
這事沒那麼簡單 我們沒做錯什麼
It's not that simple. We did nothing wrong!

2027
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:23,430
不，我們有錯
Yeah, we did.

2028
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:30,610
我們本該為那些沒有自衛能力的人而戰鬥
We were supposed to fight for people who couldn't fight for themselves.

2029
02:12:31,610 --> 02:12:34,360
我們本該為聖地亞哥而戰鬥
We were supposed to fight for Willie.

2030
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:45,210
我要帶他們去人事處辦些手續
I have to take these men over to personnel for some paperwork.

2031
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:56,760

2032
02:13:00,350 --> 02:13:01,260
長官？
Sir?

2033
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:06,230
你用不著手臂上的臂章來證明你的尊嚴
You don't need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor.

2034
02:13:09,730 --> 02:13:10,520
立正
attention hand

2035
02:13:12,770 --> 02:13:15,940
向長官致敬
There's an officer on deck.

2036
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:42,100
空軍奧馬雷和羅德瑞格…
Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Rodriguez...

2037
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:45,020
到底是來作什麼證？
What exactly were these guys gonna testify to?

2038
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:47,270
如果沒弄錯，他們是來宣誓證明…
Unless I'm mistaken, they were both gonna testify under oath...

2039
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:50,350
他們確實什麼都記不起來了
that they had absolutely no recollection of anything.

2040
02:13:50,350 --> 02:13:53,730
重要的證人 而且很帥，你覺得呢？
Strong witnesses. And handsome too, don't you think?

2041
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:57,900
回見，我得去逮捕肯德瑞克
I'll see you around campus. I gotta go arrest Kendrick.

2042
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:59,150
代我向他問好
Tell him I say hi.

2043
02:14:00,610 --> 02:14:02,240
我會的
Will do.
