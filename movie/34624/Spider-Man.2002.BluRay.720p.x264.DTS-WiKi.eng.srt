1
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,173
Who am I? You sure you want to know?

2
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:14,645
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:17,445
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...

4
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:22,113
...if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...

5
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,088
...somebody lied.

6
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:28,522
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...

7
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:30,131
...is all about a girl.

8
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,460
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

9
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:38,698
The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.

10
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:41,536
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.

11
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,702
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

12
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:47,639
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:49,811
That's me.

14
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,919
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:53,315
Stop!

16
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:55,718
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,985
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven.

18
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,424
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,665
Thank you. l'm sorry l'm late.

20
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:14,372
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:19,242
-Don't even think about it.
-You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:21,006
Would you date him?

23
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,096
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,001
No wandering. Proceed direct--
Knock it off.

25
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:48,732
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

26
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:52,376
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

27
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:54,777
So behave accordingly.

28
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:58,010
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:59,848
Come on, stay together.

30
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:02,923
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:07,119
-Where were you?
-Checking out the library.

32
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:09,856
-Looking at the books.
-Yeah, right.

33
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:15,435
-Can we drive around the corner?
-Why?

34
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:17,435
The entrance is right there.

35
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:21,304
Dad, this is public school.
l can't show up in a Rolls.

36
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:23,876
l should trade my car for a Jetta...

37
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:26,810
...because you flunked out
of private school?

38
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:30,142
-lt wasn't for me.
-Of course it was.

39
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,154
-Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
-l'm not ashamed of who l am.

40
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,653
lt's just....

41
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:38,293
Just what, Harry?

42
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,017
Forget it.

43
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:44,329
Pete!

44
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,258
-Hi, Harry.
-Hey, man. What's up?

45
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:50,332
-Won't you be needing this?
-Thanks.

46
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:55,266
-This is my father, Norman Osborn.
-l've heard so much about you.

47
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,936
-lt's an honor, sir.
-Harry says you're a science whiz.

48
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:02,014
l'm something of a scientist myself.

49
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:05,347
l read your research
on nanotechnology. Brilliant.

50
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:08,580
-You understood it?
-Yes, l wrote a paper on it.

51
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,090
lmpressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

52
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:16,789
-l live with my aunt and uncle.
-Hey, you two! Let's move!

53
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:20,629
-Nice to meet you.
-Hope to see you again.

54
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:26,464
-He doesn't seem so bad.
-Not if you're a genius.

55
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,610
l think he wants to adopt you.

56
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,612
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

57
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:33,480
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

58
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:37,483
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

59
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:38,779
That's amazing!

60
00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:42,856
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the East Coast.

61
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:45,217
lt's unreal.

62
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,192
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

63
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:51,662
...varying strengths to help them
search for food.

64
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:56,336
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

65
00:06:56,505 --> 00:07:00,669
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

66
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:02,606
For the school paper?

67
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:12,110
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...

68
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,186
...genus Kukulcania.

69
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:18,757
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

70
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:24,227
...proportionately equal to
the high-tension wires used in bridges.

71
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,361
-Leave him alone.
-Or what?

72
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:29,527
Or his father will fire your father.

73
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,271
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

74
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,932
What is going on?

75
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:38,204
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

76
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,405
-This spider...
-Let's go.

77
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:44,747
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

78
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:48,446
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

79
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:50,784
-An early awareness of danger.
-Jerks.

80
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,755
A spider-sense.

81
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:55,057
Hey, look at that spider.

82
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:59,668
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

83
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,802
lt's a defense mechanism.

84
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:05,270
Peter, what makes you think
l'd want to know that?

85
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,635
Who wouldn't?

86
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:10,643
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility....

87
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:15,216
-You gonna talk to her now?
-Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

88
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:20,185
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

89
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,052
-Disgusting.
-Yeah, hateful little things.

90
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,625
l love them!

91
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:27,822
Yeah, me too.

92
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:32,666
You know, spiders can change
their color...

93
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:36,703
-...to blend into their environment.
-Really?

94
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:41,070
-Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
-Cool.

95
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:44,576
--transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

96
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:47,841
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

97
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:52,716
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

98
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:54,355
There's 14.

99
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:56,223
l beg your pardon?

100
00:08:56,392 --> 00:08:58,917
-One's missing.
-Yeah.

101
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,459
l guess the researchers
are working on that one.

102
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:09,666
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the East Coast?

103
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,935
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

104
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:15,838
Let's talk about listening.

105
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:24,010
l don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

106
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:26,118
...but at Midtown High....

107
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:38,329
Could l take your picture?
l need one with a student in it.

108
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,401
-Sure.
-Great.

109
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:42,469
Where do you want me?
Over here?

110
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:44,002
Yeah, that's great.

111
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:46,067
Don't make me look ugly.

112
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,306
That's impossible.

113
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:56,813
Perfect.

114
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,084
-ls that good?
-Great.

115
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,032
That's great.

116
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:20,598
M.J., let's go!

117
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:24,737
Wait. Thanks!

118
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:40,957
Parker, let's do it.

119
00:10:57,713 --> 00:11:01,149
We've solved the horizon glide
and the balance issues.

120
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,875
l've already seen the glider.

121
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:06,345
That's not what l'm here for.

122
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:09,217
General Slocum, good to see you again.

123
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:12,220
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

124
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,292
-Norman.
-Mr. Osborn.

125
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:17,990
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

126
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:21,634
l want the report on human
performance enhancers.

127
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:26,298
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.

128
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:28,340
-Excellent.
-Any side effects?

129
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,602
Once.

130
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:32,440
All the tests since
have been successful.

131
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:36,346
ln the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

132
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:38,884
Violence, aggression...

133
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:40,783
...and insanity.

134
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:43,686
-What do you recommend?
-That was only one test.

135
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:47,793
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our staff certifies the product...

136
00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:50,898
-...ready for human testing.
-Dr. Stromm?

137
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:55,898
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

138
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,539
-Back to formula?
-Dr. Osborn.

139
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,540
l'll be frank with you.

140
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:07,646
l never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

141
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:10,546
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

142
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:13,654
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton.

143
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:17,925
-They test in two weeks.
-And if your performance enhancers...

144
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:22,154
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

145
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:26,800
...l'm gonna pull your funding.
l'm going to give it to them.

146
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,231
Gentlemen. Ladies.

147
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:40,748
And the Lord said, ''Let there be light.''
And voil? There is light.

148
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:43,075
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

149
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:48,087
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

150
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:50,857
l'm already on my ass, May.

151
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:55,520
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

152
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:58,394
...what would you call it?
l am on my ass.

153
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,966
Hand me that dish. The green one.

154
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:03,967
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

155
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:06,271
...and upsizing their profits.

156
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,477
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

157
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:13,381
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

158
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:17,280
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

159
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:19,078
Computer....

160
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:23,054
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

161
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:26,991
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

162
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:32,564
l'm 68. l'm too old for computers, and
besides, l have a family to provide for.

163
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,635
l love you. And Peter loves you.

164
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:39,135
You're the most responsible man
l've ever known.

165
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:43,811
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

166
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:49,247
Hi, sweetie. You're just--
Just in time for dinner.

167
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:52,011
How you doing? How was the field trip?

168
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:54,985
l don't feel well.
l'm gonna go to sleep.

169
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:57,648
-You won't have a bite?
-Had a bite.

170
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:00,260
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

171
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:03,929
l gotta crash. Everything's fine.

172
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,926
What's that all about?

173
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,420
In this recombination lab...

174
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:35,188
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

175
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,456
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

176
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:43,468
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

177
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:01,889
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

178
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,389
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

179
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:09,223
Now, l'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

180
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,628
Don't be a coward.

181
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,660
Risks are part of laboratory science.

182
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,601
Let me reschedule,
with a medical staff and a volunteer.

183
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,241
-Just give me two weeks.
-Two weeks?

184
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,904
Two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

185
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,844
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

186
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:31,679
-Get me the Promachloraperazine.
-For what?

187
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:35,620
lt begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

188
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,188
40,000 years of evolution...

189
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:44,128
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

190
00:15:57,946 --> 00:15:59,277
Oh, that's cold.

191
00:16:57,773 --> 00:16:59,001
Norman?

192
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,809
Norman!

193
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:16,855
Oh, my God.

194
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,793
Oh, my God!

195
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:24,295
Oh, my God! Norman!

196
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:42,309
Back to formula?

197
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:18,408
Weird.

198
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:30,729
-Peter?
-Yeah?

199
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:32,695
Are you all right?

200
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:36,230
l'm fine.

201
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:40,205
-Any better this morning? Any change?
-Change?

202
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,109
Yep. Big change.

203
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:47,304
-Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
-Right.

204
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,065
Okay.

205
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:15,573
-Goodness me!
-Jeez. l thought you were sick.

206
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,442
-l got better.
-See?

207
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:20,979
-Bye, guys.
-Have you got your lunch money?

208
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:24,846
Don't forget, we're painting
the kitchen after school.

209
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,784
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

210
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,082
And don't start up with me.

211
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,357
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

212
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:39,995
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

213
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:43,763
-l have to go to school.
-Who's stopping you?

214
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:02,817
Hi, M.J.

215
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,182
Hey, M.J.

216
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,988
l don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since l was 6.

217
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,498
And l was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

218
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:15,260
l got the car. Hop in.

219
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:18,031
Do something fun?
Or, l don't know.

220
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:22,107
l thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

221
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:23,606
Or not.

222
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,780
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

223
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:35,846
-Stop the bus!
-Catch a cab!

224
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,918
Tell him to stop.

225
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,551
-Check him out!
-Dork!

226
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:04,313
Dad!

227
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:06,653
Dad, are you all right?

228
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:08,751
Harry.

229
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:14,084
What are you doing on the floor?

230
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:15,593
l don't know.

231
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:18,762
Have you been there all night?

232
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,031
Last night l was--

233
00:21:24,372 --> 00:21:25,600
What?

234
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,275
-l don't remember.
-Mr. Osborn?

235
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:31,172
Sir, l asked her to wait.

236
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:35,715
-My father's not feeling well.
-Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

237
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:36,873
What?

238
00:21:37,052 --> 00:21:40,613
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

239
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:44,190
-What?
-And the flight suit and the glider....

240
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,350
-What about it?
-Stolen, sir.

241
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:14,050
Wow! Great reflexes!

242
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:17,084
-Thanks.
-No problem.

243
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,095
Hey, you have blue eyes.
l didn't notice without your glasses.

244
00:22:22,831 --> 00:22:24,526
You just get contacts?

245
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:33,434
Well, see you.

246
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:18,708
-What happened?
-He's freaking weird.

247
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:20,586
Did you see that?

248
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:23,818
Parker?

249
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,056
-lt's a fight!
-Think you're funny?

250
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:01,252
-lt was an accident.
-So is my breaking your teeth.

251
00:24:01,496 --> 00:24:04,192
-Flash, stop.
-l don't want to fight you.

252
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:07,767
-l wouldn't want to fight me neither.
-Kick his ass.

253
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,019
Help him, Harry.

254
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,451
How'd he do that?

255
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:36,791
Which one?

256
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:38,364
He's all yours, man.

257
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:55,577
Flash, get up!

258
00:24:57,218 --> 00:25:00,312
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

259
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:03,747
That was amazing.

260
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:06,683
l'm out of here. Come on.

261
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:52,890
Go, web!

262
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:56,094
Fly.

263
00:26:57,705 --> 00:26:59,798
Up, up and away, web.

264
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:02,809
Shazam!

265
00:27:03,378 --> 00:27:04,675
Go! Go!

266
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:06,608
Go, web, go!

267
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:41,476
Tallyho.

268
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:28,020
-ls she back with the beer yet?
-What?

269
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:29,458
Bring me some beer.

270
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,189
-Get up off your ass.
-l paid for beer--

271
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,867
-Stop yelling.
-Stop it!

272
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:36,401
You're as stupid as your mother.

273
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:40,831
Where's she going?
Where you going?

274
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:45,276
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

275
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,779
-Why don't you do them?
-Get in here and do the dishes.

276
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:53,113
-You do them. They're yours, anyway.
-l'm going out!

277
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:55,812
-Were you listening to that?
-No.

278
00:28:56,157 --> 00:28:59,422
Well, l heard, but l was
just taking out the trash.

279
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:02,324
l guess you can always hear us.

280
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:04,795
Everybody shouts.

281
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:07,360
Your aunt and uncle don't.

282
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:10,197
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

283
00:29:11,572 --> 00:29:15,804
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash--

284
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:17,671
You really freaked us out.

285
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:20,143
l'm sorry. ls he okay?

286
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:24,384
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

287
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:30,685
So where are you going
after you graduate?

288
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:37,727
l wanna move into the city.

289
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:43,467
And, hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

290
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:46,471
Work my way through college.

291
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:48,772
What about you?

292
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,967
Headed for the city too.

293
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,909
Can't wait to get out of here.

294
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,573
l wanna....

295
00:29:57,852 --> 00:29:59,342
What?

296
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,351
No, come on. Try me.

297
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,849
l wanna...

298
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:09,292
...act...

299
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:11,988
...on-stage.

300
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,297
Really?

301
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:16,863
Oh, that's perfect.

302
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:19,698
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

303
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,872
-Really?
-Yeah.

304
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:25,535
l cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

305
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:28,208
Peter, that was first grade.

306
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:30,206
Well...

307
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:32,242
...even so.

308
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:35,154
Sometimes...

309
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:37,650
...you know people.

310
00:30:38,826 --> 00:30:42,421
You can just see what's coming.

311
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:48,263
What do you see coming for you?

312
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:52,533
l don't know.

313
00:30:54,842 --> 00:30:59,541
Whatever it is, it's something
l never felt before.

314
00:31:03,117 --> 00:31:06,018
And what for me?

315
00:31:06,187 --> 00:31:07,552
For you?

316
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:11,686
You're gonna light up Broadway.

317
00:31:13,194 --> 00:31:14,559
You know...

318
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:21,561
...you're taller than you look.

319
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:23,260
l hunch.

320
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:26,996
Don't.

321
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:34,207
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

322
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:36,480
Come on.

323
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:38,882
l gotta go.

324
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,880
Bye.

325
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:44,217
-Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
-Yeah, right.

326
00:31:44,392 --> 00:31:46,383
-Look at it!
-Hop in.

327
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,824
Oh, my God! What a cool car!

328
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:50,654
Pretty tight, huh?

329
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:55,398
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

330
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:58,399
Cool car.

331
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:33,191
What's going on in there?

332
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:35,995
l'm exercising.
l'm not dressed, Aunt May.

333
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:39,832
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

334
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:42,234
Okay. Thanks.

335
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,373
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.

336
00:34:16,544 --> 00:34:19,240
Maybe l'm too embarrassed to ask him.

337
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:22,039
l just don't know anymore.

338
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:25,008
l'm going to the library.
See you later.

339
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:28,619
-Wait. l'll drive you there.
-l'll take the train.

340
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:32,020
No, l need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

341
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,528
-Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
-Wait. We need to talk.

342
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:51,076
-We can talk later.
-Well, we can talk now. lf you let me.

343
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:54,209
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

344
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:58,409
We haven't talked for so long.
May and l don't know who you are.

345
00:34:58,586 --> 00:35:03,580
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

346
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:07,887
-You start fights at school.
-l told you l didn't start that fight.

347
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:11,064
-You sure finished it.
-Was l supposed to run away?

348
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:14,267
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but....

349
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:18,997
You're changing. l went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

350
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:21,197
No. Not exactly.

351
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:25,272
These are the years
when a man changes...

352
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:29,439
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

353
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:32,711
Just be careful who you change into.

354
00:35:34,255 --> 00:35:38,749
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

355
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:42,022
But just because you can
beat him up...

356
00:35:42,463 --> 00:35:44,727
...doesn't give you the right to.

357
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:50,632
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

358
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:56,232
Are you afraid l'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

359
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,846
Something's different.
l'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.

360
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:04,312
l don't mean to lecture or preach.
And l know l'm not your father.

361
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:07,352
Then stop pretending to be!

362
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:12,653
Right.

363
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:17,597
l'll pick you up here at 10.

364
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:51,365
Who am I? You sure you want to know?

365
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:56,894
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

366
00:36:59,406 --> 00:37:03,433
-One, two, three. That's it!
-Who's the man?

367
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:09,778
Ladies and gentlemen...

368
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,478
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

369
00:37:17,558 --> 00:37:21,221
For $3000...

370
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:25,023
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

371
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,932
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

372
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:34,565
Who?

373
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:36,707
l know who.

374
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:41,711
The Flying Dutchman!

375
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:43,516
Next.

376
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:47,650
There's no featherweight
division here. Next.

377
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:49,652
No, no. Sign me up.

378
00:37:50,057 --> 00:37:53,493
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

379
00:37:53,694 --> 00:37:57,858
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

380
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:01,193
And you're participating
under your own free will?

381
00:38:01,368 --> 00:38:05,395
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

382
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:10,238
Told you! Told you!

383
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:12,240
Winner!

384
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,673
Next victim!

385
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:18,416
Are you ready for more?

386
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:23,114
Bone Saw is ready!

387
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,223
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

388
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:35,130
lf he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

389
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:39,771
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to--

390
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:43,633
-What's your name, kid?
-The Human Spider.

391
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:46,611
That's it? That's the best you got?

392
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,907
-Yeah.
-Oh, that sucks.

393
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:53,577
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

394
00:38:53,754 --> 00:38:57,019
...the terrifying, the deadly...

395
00:38:57,258 --> 00:39:00,455
...the amazing Spider-Man!

396
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,458
-lt's ''The Human Spider.''
-Get out there.

397
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:08,659
-No, he got my name wrong.
-Get out there, moron.

398
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,731
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

399
00:39:13,974 --> 00:39:15,965
l hope you brought your mommy.

400
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:19,703
-We'll break you!
-You'll need someone to cry to.

401
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:26,112
l'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

402
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,645
Oh, my God!

403
00:39:28,856 --> 00:39:30,483
Oh, my legs!

404
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:33,286
Oh, God. l can't feel my legs.

405
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,451
Kill! Kill! Kill!

406
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:45,194
Cage! Cage! Cage!

407
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:46,600
Cage!

408
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:57,382
Hello? Guys?

409
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:03,389
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

410
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:08,390
This is some kind of mistake.
l didn't sign up for a cage match!

411
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:12,087
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

412
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,096
Hey, freak show!

413
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:16,895
You're going nowhere.

414
00:40:17,104 --> 00:40:19,470
l got you for three minutes.

415
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,904
Three minutes of playtime.

416
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:32,007
-What are you doing up there?
-Staying away from you.

417
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:36,246
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

418
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:43,487
Finish him off!

419
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:52,195
Smash him!

420
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,143
-Hit him!
-Harder!

421
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,448
Kick his spider ass!

422
00:41:07,454 --> 00:41:08,648
Hit him!

423
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:23,866
One, two, three!

424
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:26,869
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

425
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,103
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

426
00:41:49,496 --> 00:41:51,191
Now get out of here.

427
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,633
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

428
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:58,236
Well, check it again, webhead.

429
00:41:58,405 --> 00:42:02,273
lt said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

430
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:05,843
For that, l give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

431
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:07,412
l need that money.

432
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:10,942
l missed the part
where that's my problem.

433
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:22,359
-Hey, what the hell--?
-Put the money in the bag.

434
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,528
Hurry up!

435
00:42:31,872 --> 00:42:33,965
Hey! He stole the gate!

436
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:36,109
Stop that guy!

437
00:42:36,376 --> 00:42:38,936
Stop him! He's got my money!

438
00:42:39,146 --> 00:42:40,374
Thanks.

439
00:42:41,648 --> 00:42:44,014
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!

440
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,448
Cut him off and call the cops!

441
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,647
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.

442
00:42:50,824 --> 00:42:54,191
l missed the part
where that's my problem.

443
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:13,981
-You gotta get back.
-l can't see. What happened?

444
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:15,505
-You gotta get back.
-l can't see. What happened?

445
00:43:16,783 --> 00:43:18,148
Old dude, man.

446
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:22,516
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

447
00:43:22,689 --> 00:43:25,522
-What happened?
-Someone got hurt.

448
00:43:27,895 --> 00:43:31,092
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Stay back.

449
00:43:31,598 --> 00:43:33,429
-Stay back!
-That's my uncle!

450
00:43:35,602 --> 00:43:38,332
-What happened?
-Carjacker. He's been shot.

451
00:43:38,505 --> 00:43:41,906
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

452
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:43,508
Uncle Ben?

453
00:43:44,411 --> 00:43:45,901
Uncle Ben.

454
00:43:49,683 --> 00:43:51,014
Uncle Ben?

455
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:56,111
Peter.

456
00:43:57,024 --> 00:43:58,821
l'm here, Uncle Ben.

457
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:05,625
Peter.

458
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:30,647
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

459
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:35,590
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

460
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:14,710
Get a unit to the rear!

461
00:47:17,657 --> 00:47:19,215
l got the back!

462
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:33,538
Who's there?

463
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:02,860
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

464
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:07,529
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

465
00:48:07,707 --> 00:48:09,197
Answer me!

466
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:13,876
Stop that guy!

467
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:21,081
Thanks.

468
00:48:30,964 --> 00:48:32,090
See you.

469
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:57,211
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.

470
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:42,293
Oh, no. My God.

471
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:47,968
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

472
00:49:56,316 --> 00:49:59,285
-Good evening.
-General. Good to see you.

473
00:50:00,086 --> 00:50:02,953
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

474
00:50:03,123 --> 00:50:08,288
Well, if it does what you say it can,
l'll sign that contract tomorrow.

475
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:12,795
-He's clear! Go!
-You're confident about this test?

476
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:15,264
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.

477
00:50:16,002 --> 00:50:18,766
Now, what about your commitment
to OSCORP?

478
00:50:18,939 --> 00:50:22,841
Nothing would please me more
than to put Osborn out of business.

479
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:28,237
Preflight complete. Mark.

480
00:50:32,352 --> 00:50:34,980
An unidentified object
is closing fast.

481
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:36,247
What's that?

482
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:37,913
Can you see anything?

483
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:39,757
Oh, my God!

484
00:50:50,036 --> 00:50:52,869
-Say ''chess.''
-Chess!

485
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:55,273
Peter!

486
00:50:55,475 --> 00:51:00,003
Darling, l'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

487
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,672
Dad got the place in New York,
so we're all set for fall.

488
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,374
-Great!
-You made it.

489
00:51:08,154 --> 00:51:11,487
lt's not the first time
l've been proven wrong.

490
00:51:12,892 --> 00:51:15,053
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Dad.

491
00:51:15,495 --> 00:51:18,123
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

492
00:51:18,498 --> 00:51:19,795
Yeah.

493
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:26,136
l know this has been
a difficult time for you...

494
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:29,537
...but l want you to try
to enjoy this day.

495
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:31,300
Commencement:

496
00:51:31,478 --> 00:51:35,574
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

497
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:41,080
l don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

498
00:51:41,988 --> 00:51:43,853
You know what? Whatever.

499
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:45,858
Your loss.

500
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,086
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

501
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:54,323
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

502
00:52:08,014 --> 00:52:10,244
Can l fix you something?

503
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:11,907
No, thanks.

504
00:52:56,663 --> 00:52:58,893
l missed him a lot today.

505
00:53:01,468 --> 00:53:02,958
l know.

506
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:06,568
l miss him too.

507
00:53:08,308 --> 00:53:10,640
But he was there.

508
00:53:13,813 --> 00:53:19,012
l can't help thinking about
the last thing l said to him.

509
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:24,256
He tried to tell me something important,
and l threw it in his face.

510
00:53:25,992 --> 00:53:28,085
You loved him...

511
00:53:29,762 --> 00:53:31,992
...and he loved you.

512
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:36,528
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

513
00:53:36,703 --> 00:53:40,161
How you were meant for great things.

514
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:43,039
You won't disappoint him.

515
00:54:16,576 --> 00:54:20,740
With great power
comes great responsibility.

516
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:24,144
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.

517
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,457
Hurry up!

518
00:54:47,774 --> 00:54:51,540
He's not a man. My brother saw him
build a nest in Lincoln Center.

519
00:54:51,711 --> 00:54:54,908
l think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

520
00:54:59,018 --> 00:55:01,748
Bobby. Get a load of this!

521
00:55:04,924 --> 00:55:09,190
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out, and he climbs up them.

522
00:55:09,495 --> 00:55:13,591
l see the web, his signature,
and l know Spider-Man was here.

523
00:55:13,766 --> 00:55:16,394
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

524
00:55:16,569 --> 00:55:19,299
Some kind of freakyloo or something.

525
00:55:19,505 --> 00:55:21,496
He stinks and l don't like him.

526
00:55:22,242 --> 00:55:23,800
Don't move, lady!

527
00:55:31,918 --> 00:55:34,648
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

528
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:36,980
Those tights and that tight little--

529
00:55:37,156 --> 00:55:40,523
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug

530
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:44,458
But we should all just give him
One big hug

531
00:55:44,664 --> 00:55:49,260
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

532
00:55:52,939 --> 00:55:56,670
''Who is Spider-Man?''
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

533
00:55:56,843 --> 00:55:58,978
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

534
00:55:58,978 --> 00:56:03,916
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs--

535
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:06,544
-There's a page six problem.
-We have a page one problem.

536
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:08,243
-Well?
-He's news.

537
00:56:08,454 --> 00:56:10,945
-The clients can't wait.
-They're about to.

538
00:56:11,124 --> 00:56:15,117
-He pulled six people off a subway.
-From a wreck he probably caused.

539
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:19,459
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.

540
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:23,591
He's probably going to save
somebody else. He's a hero!

541
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,534
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?

542
00:56:26,706 --> 00:56:29,766
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.

543
00:56:29,942 --> 00:56:32,376
-Whichever's cheaper.
-lt's like this:

544
00:56:32,578 --> 00:56:36,378
We double-booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have--

545
00:56:36,582 --> 00:56:39,710
-We sold out four printings.
-Sold out?

546
00:56:39,886 --> 00:56:41,148
Every copy.

547
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:45,483
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.

548
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:48,559
-That's a problem.
-Then make it page eight.

549
00:56:48,728 --> 00:56:50,389
-That can't be done.
-Get out!

550
00:56:50,596 --> 00:56:55,465
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's
on it, but we can barely see him.

551
00:56:55,635 --> 00:56:57,728
Aw, what is he, shy?

552
00:56:57,904 --> 00:57:01,897
lf we can get Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

553
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:05,509
On the front page:
''Cash for a Spider-Man picture.''

554
00:57:05,678 --> 00:57:09,136
He doesn't want to be famous?
l'll make him infamous!

555
00:57:21,627 --> 00:57:23,026
Buzz off.

556
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,699
-M.J., it's me, Peter.
-Hi!

557
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:33,270
-What are you doing around here?
-Begging for a job. How about you?

558
00:57:33,773 --> 00:57:37,504
-l'm headed to an audition.
-An audition? So you're acting?

559
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:38,778
Yeah.

560
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,856
l work steady.
ln fact, l just got off a job.

561
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,220
That's great.

562
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,991
-You're doing it. Living your dream.
-Glamour girl!

563
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,791
Your drawer was short $6!

564
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,594
Next time, l'll take it
from your check.

565
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,470
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
l'm talking to you! Hey!

566
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,972
Yes, Enrique! Okay? l get you.

567
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,273
lt better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

568
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,949
Some dream, huh?

569
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,451
lt's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

570
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,390
-Don't tell Harry.
-Don't tell Harry?

571
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,391
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

572
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,392
Oh, yeah. Right.

573
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,729
l think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

574
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:34,343
-He'd think it was low or something.
-lt's not low. You have a job.

575
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:39,011
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place l like to call Earth.

576
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,417
No, l guess not.

577
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,015
Thanks, Pete.

578
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,360
We should catch up sometime.

579
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,091
Let's get some lunch some evening.

580
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,864
l'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

581
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,770
-And l won't tell Harry.
-Don't tell Harry.

582
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,206
l won't.

583
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,110
l won't tell Harry.

584
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,895
Timing's perfect. Hey.

585
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:30,395
Five new contracts. lt'll be great.

586
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:35,197
Norman's making his weekly inspection.

587
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,269
Spent half of it on the phone.

588
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:43,574
Look, man, l'm glad you're here.
l need your help. l'm really lost here.

589
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,711
Are you all right?

590
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:51,578
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

591
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,790
l was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

592
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,551
You were late again?

593
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:02,120
l don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

594
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,560
Around.

595
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,428
Peter Parker.

596
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,259
-Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
-Who?

597
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,498
-This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
-Dad.

598
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,569
When do l get to meet her?

599
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:17,008
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

600
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:23,147
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

601
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,184
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

602
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,689
-l appreciate it, but l'll be fine.
-l'll make a few calls.

603
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:35,159
l couldn't accept it. l like to earn
what l get. l'll find work.

604
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:36,990
l respect that.

605
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,827
You want to make it on your own.

606
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:41,834
That's great.

607
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:45,037
What other skills do you have?

608
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,367
l was thinking about photography.

609
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,608
Hello.

610
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:55,814
Let's go! Move it!

611
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,647
Watch the street!

612
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,469
Cheese!

613
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,677
They're crap.

614
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:28,851
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

615
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:32,215
-l'll give you $200.
-That seems a little low.

616
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,184
Take them somewhere else.

617
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:38,686
-Your wife says the tile's out of stock.
-We'll put a rug there.

618
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,030
Sit down. Give me that.

619
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:45,158
Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.

620
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,666
-Scrap page one. Run that.
-Headline?

621
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,167
''Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos.''

622
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,468
-Menace? He was protecting--
-You take the photos...

623
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:57,339
...l'll make up the headlines. Okay?

624
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,504
-Yes, sir.
-Goody.

625
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:03,474
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

626
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,718
-l'd like a job, sir.
-No jobs. Freelance.

627
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,550
Best thing for you.

628
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:13,058
You bring me more shots of that clown,
maybe l'll buy them.

629
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,231
But l never said you have a job. Meat.

630
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,699
l'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

631
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,499
-Hi.
-Hi.

632
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:27,107
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

633
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:31,305
-Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
-Thank you.

634
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,246
l'm Peter Parker.

635
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,913
l'm a photographer.

636
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,246
Yes. l can see that.

637
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,796
As of today...

638
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:54,960
...OSCORP lndustries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

639
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:59,641
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

640
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,642
ln short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

641
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:05,975
...costs are down, revenues are up...

642
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,082
...and our stock
has never been higher.

643
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:13,655
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

644
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,752
What?

645
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:21,123
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

646
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,094
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

647
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,427
Why wasn't l told?

648
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:29,662
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

649
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,270
The deal is off if you come with it.

650
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:35,842
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

651
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,012
You can't do this to me.

652
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,482
l started this company.

653
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,954
You know how much l sacrificed?!

654
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:56,231
-Oh, Max. Please.
-Norman, the board is unanimous.

655
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,792
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

656
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,460
l'm sorry.

657
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,599
You're out, Norman.

658
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:16,974
Am l?

659
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:25,995
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.

660
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:29,692
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

661
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,661
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

662
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:12,367
Just, l wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

663
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:17,035
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think l'm pretty.

664
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,979
l think you're beautiful.

665
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:36,060
l forgot my drink inside.

666
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,402
-Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
-Oh, Harry.

667
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:54,643
-Have you seen my father?
-Well, l'm not sure if he's coming.

668
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:09,153
-What is that?
-Must be new this year.

669
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,333
What is that?

670
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,438
That's our glider!

671
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,284
What the hell was that?

672
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,079
Code three!

673
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:17,292
-Oh, my God! Harry!
-M.J.!

674
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,697
Harry! Help me! Harry!

675
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,410
Out, am l?

676
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:42,185
-Mary Jane!
-Harry!

677
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,058
Hello, my dear.

678
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,894
lt's Spider-Man!

679
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,377
-Come on. Move, kid.
-Billy!

680
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,213
Somebody help him!

681
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,442
No!

682
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,978
Mommy!

683
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,958
-Hold it!
-l surrender.

684
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,051
-Oh, boy.
-Hold it right there!

685
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,096
lmpressive.

686
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:54,829
-Mary Jane!
-Help! Someone please help me!

687
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,213
Hold on!

688
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:23,916
Watch out!

689
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:36,835
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

690
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:25,013
Well, beats taking the subway.

691
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,418
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

692
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:29,750
Wait.

693
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:31,187
Who are you?

694
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,920
-You know who l am.
-l do?

695
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,757
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

696
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:52,378
lncredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

697
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:57,212
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. l'm gonna come over.

698
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,547
No, l'm gonna come--

699
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:03,289
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

700
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:06,460
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

701
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,927
...l want to buy you something.

702
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,431
Because l want to.
lt'll make you feel better.

703
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:17,132
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

704
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,341
All right. l'm sorry. Sleep tight.

705
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:24,273
Don't let the bedbugs--

706
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,987
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

707
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:38,319
Look, Pete, l should have
told you about us.

708
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,323
But you should know
l'm crazy about her.

709
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:45,558
lt's just, you know,
you never made a move.

710
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,125
You're right.

711
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,561
l didn't.

712
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,976
l'm gonna get some rest.

713
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:00,477
l'm gonna stay up for a while.

714
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:03,312
What was that thing?

715
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,319
l don't know.

716
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:10,022
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

717
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:28,010
Somebody there?

718
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,171
Somebody.

719
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,737
Who said that?

720
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:36,748
Don't play the innocent with me.

721
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,883
You've known all along.

722
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,259
Where are you?

723
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:51,559
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

724
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,205
I'm right here.

725
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:03,935
l don't understand.

726
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:08,144
Did you think it was coincidence?

727
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,911
So many good things,
all happening for you.

728
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:15,750
All for you. Norman.

729
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,726
What do you want?

730
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,287
To say what you won't.

731
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:25,158
To do what you can't.

732
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:29,896
To remove those in your way.

733
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,810
The board members.

734
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,477
You killed them.

735
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,272
We killed them.

736
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:41,605
We?

737
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,308
Remember?

738
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:46,181
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

739
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,817
The performance enhancers.

740
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:54,995
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

741
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:59,297
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

742
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:02,335
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

743
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,995
And it's only the beginning.

744
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:10,842
There's only one who can stop us.

745
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:15,139
Or imagine if he joined us.

746
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:23,019
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

747
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,523
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

748
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:29,720
-These weirdos all got to have a name.
-Mr. Jameson--

749
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,525
-Hoffman!
-Yeah?

750
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:36,499
Copyright ''Green Goblin.''
l want a quarter every time it's said.

751
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,002
How about ''Green Meanie''?

752
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,041
Spider-Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.

753
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:44,542
lt is not. l resent that.

754
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:47,543
Slander is spoken.
ln print, it's libel.

755
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,375
You don't trust anybody.

756
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,615
l trust my barber.

757
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:53,944
Are you his lawyer?

758
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:58,889
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country--

759
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,529
Jameson, you slime.

760
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:13,036
Who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

761
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:16,176
-l don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
-Liar!

762
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:19,337
-l swear.
-He's the one who can bring me to him.

763
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,416
-l don't know who he is.
-You are useless.

764
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,881
Set him down, tough guy.

765
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:29,715
-Speak of the devil.
-l knew you two were in this together!

766
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,519
Kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute.

767
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:35,196
Sleep....

768
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:53,671
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

769
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:58,252
No, you're not dead yet.

770
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,614
Just paralyzed...

771
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:02,756
...temporarily.

772
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:06,853
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

773
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,724
You and l are not so different.

774
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,765
l'm not like you. You're a murderer.

775
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,870
Well, to each his own.

776
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,974
l chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

777
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:25,272
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

778
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,745
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

779
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:32,546
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

780
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:37,317
ln spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

781
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:38,481
Why bother?

782
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:43,426
-Because it's right.
-Here's the real truth.

783
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:46,857
There are eight million people
in this city.

784
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:51,369
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

785
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:55,509
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

786
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:57,110
You, me...

787
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,613
...we're exceptional.

788
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:04,511
l could squash you like a bug
right now.

789
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:08,382
But l'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

790
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:12,151
lmagine what we could
accomplish together.

791
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:15,124
What we could create.

792
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,688
Or we could destroy.

793
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:21,835
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

794
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:26,940
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. ls that what you want?

795
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,811
Think about it, hero.

796
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:49,128
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

797
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:00,941
lt's me again.

798
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,708
How was your audition?

799
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,936
-How'd you know?
-The hot line. Your mom...

800
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:08,048
...told my aunt, told me.

801
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,848
So you just came by?

802
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:13,681
l was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

803
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:18,451
l took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but....

804
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,184
So how'd it go?

805
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,924
They said l needed acting lessons.

806
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,866
A soap opera told me
l needed acting lessons.

807
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:34,373
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

808
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,770
l'd like a cheeseburger.

809
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:41,704
Oh, but l'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

810
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:43,550
Come with us.

811
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,483
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

812
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,881
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

813
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,883
lt's not?

814
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:55,991
Why so interested?

815
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,121
l'm not.

816
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,765
You're not?

817
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,133
-Well, why would l be?
-l don't know.

818
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,203
Why would you be?

819
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,408
l, that's a--

820
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,102
l don't know.

821
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:17,149
Sorry you won't come with us.

822
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,589
l'd better run, tiger.

823
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,289
Hey, check it out, man.

824
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,128
Come on, man.

825
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:40,937
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

826
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:00,294
Get off me!

827
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:35,085
Wait!

828
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:42,301
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

829
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:46,839
You have a knack for saving my life.
l think l have a superhero stalker.

830
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:48,907
l was in the neighborhood.

831
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:53,406
You are amazing.

832
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:57,112
Some people don't think so.

833
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:01,178
-But you are.
-Nice to have a fan.

834
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:05,154
Do l get to say thank you this time?

835
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,517
Wait.

836
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,659
Let me in! My baby's in there!

837
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,926
-Let me go!
-The roof's collapsing!

838
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:24,594
-Somebody save my baby!
-The roof's about to collapse!

839
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,137
Look! Up there!

840
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:34,611
Save my baby, please!

841
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,466
No!

842
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:11,175
-lt's okay. Your baby's fine.
-Oh, my baby!

843
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,154
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

844
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:17,119
Don't let him get away!

845
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,556
Hold it! You're under arrest.
l'm taking you in.

846
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:24,061
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

847
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:26,864
l'm going.

848
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:31,562
-l'll be here when you get back.
-Not coming back.

849
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,133
Go! Go!

850
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,779
Where are you?

851
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,378
Where are you?

852
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:55,160
l'm gonna get you out of here!

853
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:59,222
lt's okay.

854
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,867
You're pathetically predictable.

855
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,944
Like a moth to the flame.

856
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:14,314
What about my generous proposal?

857
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,183
Are you in or are you out?

858
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:24,325
-lt's you who's out. Out of your mind.
-Wrong answer.

859
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,216
Oh, great.

860
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,663
No one says no to me!

861
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:18,445
-M.J., will you stop goofing around?
-Harry, relax.

862
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,177
He's here.

863
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:24,474
Are you ready?

864
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:28,983
Aunt May. l'm sorry l'm late.

865
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:32,284
Work was murder.
l picked up a fruitcake.

866
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:35,827
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

867
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:38,894
Who is this lovely young lady?

868
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:43,333
l'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

869
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:46,200
l've been looking forward
to meeting you.

870
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:50,138
-Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
-Now, where is Peter?

871
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,677
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

872
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:02,014
Oh, that's weird.
l didn't know he was here.

873
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,516
Peter?

874
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,298
ls that you?

875
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:25,941
How strange. There's nobody here.

876
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:36,881
-Bit of a slob, isn't he?
-All brilliant men are.

877
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,084
-Hey, everyone.
-Oh, Peter!

878
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,023
lt's a jungle out there.

879
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:18,097
Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

880
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:21,399
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

881
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,127
...and we can say grace.

882
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,437
Here we go.

883
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,748
-There we are.
-lt looks delicious.

884
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:43,820
Will you do the honors?

885
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:58,767
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

886
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:06,945
l stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

887
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,639
Well, let me see.

888
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,442
Oh, my goodness.

889
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,018
-That looks awful.
-No, it's nothing.

890
01:28:13,187 --> 01:28:16,315
l'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

891
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:21,824
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

892
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,857
How did you say that happened?

893
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,996
Bike messenger.

894
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,170
Knocked me down.

895
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:39,307
-lf you'll excuse me, l've got to go.
-Why?

896
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:43,515
Something has come to my attention.

897
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:44,980
Are you all right?

898
01:28:45,186 --> 01:28:48,678
l'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

899
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,690
-Enjoy the fruitcake.
-Dad!

900
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:57,661
l planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

901
01:28:57,865 --> 01:28:59,594
l've got to go.

902
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:03,997
-This girl is important to me.
-Harry, please. Look at her.

903
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:08,164
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?

904
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:11,401
-What are you saying?
-Your mother was beautiful.

905
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:17,016
They're all beautiful until they're
snarling after your money like wolves.

906
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:18,515
You're wrong, Dad.

907
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,183
A word to the not-so-wise
about your girlfriend:

908
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:26,258
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

909
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:39,195
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

910
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:42,376
-You heard?
-Everyone heard that creep.

911
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:46,445
That creep is my father.
With luck, l'll be half of what he is.

912
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:49,046
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

913
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,878
Harry Osborn!

914
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,012
l'm sorry, Aunt May.

915
01:29:56,958 --> 01:30:00,291
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

916
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:03,624
But Parker, we can destroy him.

917
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,129
l can't.

918
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:08,291
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

919
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:10,799
Parker must be educated.

920
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:14,271
What do l do?

921
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:18,571
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

922
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,772
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

923
01:30:22,049 --> 01:30:23,311
Yes?

924
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:25,418
And then grant his wish.

925
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,617
But how?

926
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:32,122
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

927
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:33,486
Tell me how!

928
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,821
The heart, Osborn.

929
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,123
First, we attack his heart.

930
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:44,494
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

931
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,708
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

932
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:51,775
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us--

933
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,080
Deliver us!

934
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,655
Finish it!

935
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:07,860
-Finish it!
-From evil!

936
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:15,762
Two milligrams lV.

937
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:18,800
Get the BP.

938
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,801
Aunt May. ls she gonna be okay?
What happened?

939
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,341
You have to leave.

940
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:26,241
-What happened?
-Those eyes!

941
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:30,474
Those horrible yellow eyes!

942
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,848
He knows who l am.

943
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:23,394
l'm sorry.

944
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:29,576
-Will she be okay?
-She'll be fine.

945
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:32,406
She's been sleeping all day.

946
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:36,178
-Thanks for coming.
-Of course.

947
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:43,255
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

948
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:47,087
Yeah, l'm fine. l just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

949
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:50,330
-Have you talked to Harry?
-He called me.

950
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:52,926
l haven't called him back.

951
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:56,731
The fact is...

952
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:00,738
-...l'm in love with somebody else.
-You are?

953
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:03,103
At least l think l am.

954
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:07,839
-lt's not the time to talk about it.
-No. Go on.

955
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:11,246
Would l know his name, this guy?

956
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:14,319
You'll think l'm a little girl
with a crush.

957
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:15,887
Trust me.

958
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:17,385
lt's funny.

959
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:23,329
He's saved my life twice,
and l've never even seen his face.

960
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:26,898
-Oh. Him.
-You're laughing at me.

961
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:30,070
No, l understand.
He is extremely cool.

962
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:34,571
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say?

963
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:37,643
Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

964
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:39,470
l know him a little bit.

965
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,581
l'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

966
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:45,911
-Has he mentioned me?
-Yeah.

967
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:47,686
What'd he say?

968
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,620
l said....

969
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:54,991
He asked me what l thought about you.

970
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,955
And what did you say?

971
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:02,762
l said, ''Spider-Man.''

972
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:07,973
l said, ''The great thing about M.J...

973
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:09,699
...is...

974
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,910
...when you look in her eyes...

975
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:19,647
...and she's looking back in yours...

976
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,647
...everything feels...

977
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:26,690
...not quite normal.

978
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:29,725
Because you feel...

979
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:31,924
...stronger...

980
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:37,062
...and weaker at the same time.

981
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:40,232
You feel excited...

982
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:43,167
...and at the same time...

983
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:45,438
...terrified.

984
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:52,048
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

985
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:57,082
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

986
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:01,692
lt's as if you've...

987
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:05,492
...reached the unreachable...

988
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:09,764
...and you weren't ready for it.''

989
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,003
You said that?

990
01:35:15,776 --> 01:35:18,108
Well, something like that.

991
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:03,913
Dad?

992
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:11,322
Dad, is that you?

993
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,428
What is it?

994
01:36:21,675 --> 01:36:26,669
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

995
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:30,411
She's in love with Peter.

996
01:36:30,684 --> 01:36:32,481
-Parker?
-Yeah.

997
01:36:32,653 --> 01:36:35,781
And how does he feel about her?

998
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:39,751
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

999
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:45,961
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1000
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:50,632
l'm so sorry.

1001
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:56,565
l haven't always been there for you,
have l?

1002
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:01,509
You're busy. You're an important man.
l understand.

1003
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:03,512
That's no excuse.

1004
01:37:04,518 --> 01:37:06,315
l'm proud of you.

1005
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:11,723
l've lost sight of that somewhere.
But l'll make it up to you.

1006
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:15,225
l'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1007
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:31,073
Wake up, little spider.

1008
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:32,735
Wake up.

1009
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:35,672
Go home, dear.

1010
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:37,214
You look awful.

1011
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:39,716
-And you look beautiful.
-Thank you.

1012
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,219
-l don't like to leave you here.
-But l'm safe here.

1013
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:46,120
-Can l do anything for you?
-You do too much.

1014
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:51,822
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1015
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:54,329
A smile. Finally.

1016
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:58,767
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1017
01:37:58,939 --> 01:38:01,271
You were supposed to be asleep.

1018
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:06,875
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1019
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:11,074
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1020
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:17,554
...you grabbed me and said,
''Aunt May, is that an angel?''

1021
01:38:17,758 --> 01:38:21,285
-Gee, did l say that?
-You sure did.

1022
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:26,728
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1023
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:30,700
-She's still his girl.
-Well, isn't that up to her?

1024
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:35,467
-She doesn't really know who l am.
-Because you won't let her.

1025
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:38,803
You're so mysterious all the time.

1026
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,809
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1027
01:38:42,049 --> 01:38:45,985
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1028
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:48,987
Everybody else knows.

1029
01:38:51,959 --> 01:38:53,221
l'll be right back.

1030
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:55,191
But....

1031
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:04,494
Come on, pick up.

1032
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:07,970
-Hey, M.J.
-Sing your song at the beep.

1033
01:39:09,009 --> 01:39:11,068
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1034
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:14,212
Hello? You there?

1035
01:39:14,715 --> 01:39:19,175
l'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1036
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:20,786
All right, well....

1037
01:39:21,221 --> 01:39:22,245
Don't....

1038
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:25,253
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1039
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:26,949
Hello?

1040
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:33,094
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

1041
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,029
Where is she?

1042
01:40:21,315 --> 01:40:22,976
-What is that?
-That's cool!

1043
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:27,813
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout

1044
01:40:27,988 --> 01:40:32,152
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out

1045
01:40:48,942 --> 01:40:50,671
Goblin, what have you done?

1046
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:36,987
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1047
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:38,982
Because you never know...

1048
01:41:39,226 --> 01:41:43,993
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1049
01:41:45,065 --> 01:41:47,659
Let die the woman you love...

1050
01:41:52,072 --> 01:41:57,135
...or suffer the little children.

1051
01:41:59,513 --> 01:42:01,981
-Spider-Man!
-Save us!

1052
01:42:02,516 --> 01:42:04,780
Save us!

1053
01:42:05,018 --> 01:42:07,612
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1054
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:11,188
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1055
01:42:11,391 --> 01:42:13,450
Don't do it, Goblin!

1056
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:16,528
We are who we choose to be.

1057
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:19,527
-Now, choose!
-No!

1058
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:49,820
Everybody stay still!

1059
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:00,670
Ahoy up there!

1060
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:03,742
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1061
01:43:11,251 --> 01:43:15,381
-He's coming back!
-Listen. l need you to climb down.

1062
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:17,046
-l can't.
-Yes, you can!

1063
01:43:22,162 --> 01:43:25,188
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1064
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:26,957
Trust me.

1065
01:43:28,468 --> 01:43:32,268
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1066
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:38,669
-Hurry!
-l can't. l can't do it.

1067
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:40,540
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1068
01:44:09,009 --> 01:44:11,603
-He's not gonna make it.
-He's gonna make it!

1069
01:44:21,521 --> 01:44:24,718
lt's time to die.

1070
01:44:31,732 --> 01:44:35,566
-l got something for you!
-We ought to kick your ass!

1071
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:39,137
Leave Spider-Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?

1072
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:43,298
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1073
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:47,038
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1074
01:44:59,559 --> 01:45:01,322
Spider-Man, watch out!

1075
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:37,459
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1076
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:40,993
l offered you friendship...

1077
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,033
...and you spat in my face.

1078
01:46:34,154 --> 01:46:37,783
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1079
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:41,291
Had you not been so selfish,
your girlfriend's death...

1080
01:46:41,461 --> 01:46:43,156
...would have been quick.

1081
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:46,731
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1082
01:46:46,967 --> 01:46:51,870
...l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1083
01:46:56,443 --> 01:46:58,468
M.J. and l...

1084
01:46:59,312 --> 01:47:02,611
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1085
01:47:56,436 --> 01:47:57,960
Peter, stop!

1086
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:00,606
Stop! lt's me.

1087
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:10,982
Mr. Osborn.

1088
01:48:11,184 --> 01:48:12,776
Thank God for you.

1089
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:15,284
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1090
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,515
The Goblin killed!
l had nothing to do with it!

1091
01:48:18,692 --> 01:48:20,455
Don't let him take me again.

1092
01:48:20,627 --> 01:48:22,652
l beg you. Protect me.

1093
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:26,356
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1094
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:28,056
But not you.

1095
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:32,704
l tried to stop it.
But l couldn't stop it.

1096
01:48:32,906 --> 01:48:34,999
l would never hurt you.

1097
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:37,142
l knew from the beginning...

1098
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:40,279
...if anything ever happened to me...

1099
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:42,574
...it was you l could count on.

1100
01:48:42,782 --> 01:48:46,081
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1101
01:48:46,686 --> 01:48:48,517
Thank God for you.

1102
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,922
Give me your hand.

1103
01:48:52,092 --> 01:48:55,528
Believe in me
as l believed in you.

1104
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:59,728
l've been like a father to you.

1105
01:49:01,301 --> 01:49:02,928
Be a son to me now.

1106
01:49:04,738 --> 01:49:06,603
l have a father.

1107
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:09,865
His name was Ben Parker.

1108
01:49:11,745 --> 01:49:13,212
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1109
01:49:32,132 --> 01:49:33,622
Peter.

1110
01:49:35,969 --> 01:49:37,834
Don't tell Harry.

1111
01:50:09,502 --> 01:50:11,231
What have you done?

1112
01:50:11,404 --> 01:50:12,962
What have you done?!

1113
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:43,159
l'm so sorry, Harry.

1114
01:50:44,104 --> 01:50:47,198
l know what it's like
to lose a father.

1115
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:52,674
l didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1116
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:56,544
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1117
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:01,545
l swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1118
01:51:06,559 --> 01:51:08,424
Thank God for you, Peter.

1119
01:51:09,129 --> 01:51:11,563
You're the only family l have.

1120
01:51:36,089 --> 01:51:38,387
No matter what I do...

1121
01:51:38,558 --> 01:51:41,686
...no matter how hard I try...

1122
01:51:42,262 --> 01:51:46,096
...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.

1123
01:51:56,843 --> 01:51:59,175
You must miss him so much.

1124
01:52:00,113 --> 01:52:03,173
lt's been so hard without him.

1125
01:52:06,086 --> 01:52:08,987
There's something
l've been wanting to tell you.

1126
01:52:10,757 --> 01:52:12,588
When l was up there...

1127
01:52:13,293 --> 01:52:16,091
...and l thought l was gonna die...

1128
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:21,565
...there was only one person
who l was thinking of.

1129
01:52:22,869 --> 01:52:26,066
And it wasn't who l thought it'd be.

1130
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:29,940
lt was you, Pete.

1131
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:32,710
l kept thinking:

1132
01:52:33,113 --> 01:52:35,911
''l hope l make it through this...

1133
01:52:37,383 --> 01:52:41,752
...so l can see Peter Parker's face
one more time.''

1134
01:52:43,123 --> 01:52:44,613
Really?

1135
01:52:45,024 --> 01:52:50,792
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1136
01:52:52,065 --> 01:52:54,033
...who makes me feel...

1137
01:52:54,467 --> 01:52:58,164
...like l'm more than l ever
thought l could be.

1138
01:53:00,306 --> 01:53:01,967
That l'm just...

1139
01:53:02,642 --> 01:53:04,132
...me.

1140
01:53:05,245 --> 01:53:07,145
And that's okay.

1141
01:53:09,315 --> 01:53:10,805
The truth is...

1142
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:14,749
...l love you.

1143
01:53:16,823 --> 01:53:18,791
l love you so much, Peter.

1144
01:53:39,512 --> 01:53:44,279
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.

1145
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:46,350
l can't....

1146
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:50,012
You can't what?

1147
01:53:51,124 --> 01:53:52,614
Tell you...

1148
01:53:54,327 --> 01:53:58,593
...everything.
l mean, there's so much to tell.

1149
01:53:59,732 --> 01:54:03,668
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1150
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:06,595
l want you to know...

1151
01:54:06,973 --> 01:54:09,635
...that l will always be there
for you.

1152
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:13,802
l will always be there
to take care of you.

1153
01:54:14,814 --> 01:54:16,805
l promise you that.

1154
01:54:20,119 --> 01:54:22,383
l will always be your friend.

1155
01:54:25,325 --> 01:54:27,190
Only a friend...

1156
01:54:28,061 --> 01:54:29,619
...Peter Parker?

1157
01:54:31,764 --> 01:54:34,631
That's all l have to give.

1158
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,622
Whatever life holds in store for me...

1159
01:55:03,796 --> 01:55:06,697
...I will never forget these words:

1160
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,928
''With great power
comes great responsibility. ''

1161
01:55:12,105 --> 01:55:14,369
This is my gift.

1162
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:16,667
My curse.

1163
01:55:17,176 --> 01:55:19,076
Who am I?

1164
01:55:19,445 --> 01:55:20,810
I'm Spider-Man.
