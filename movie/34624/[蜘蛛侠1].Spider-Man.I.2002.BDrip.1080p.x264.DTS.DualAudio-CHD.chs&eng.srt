1
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,650
蜘蛛侠

2
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,240
我是谁  你真的想知道
Who am I?You sure you want to know?

3
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,710
胆小鬼千万别听我的故事
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.

4
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,510
如果有人说这是个喜剧
If somebody said it was a happy little tale...

5
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,190
而我也只是个平凡且无忧无虑的普通人
...if somebody told you I was just an average guy,not a care in the world...

6
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,160
那你就被骗了
...somebody lied.

7
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,620
但我向你保证  这就跟其它的精彩故事一样
But let me assure you,this,like any story worth telling...

8
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,200
全是为了一个女孩
...is all about a girl.

9
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,570
就是她  邻家的女孩  玛莉珍华森
That girl.The girl next door.Mary Jane Watson.

10
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,770
我从小就爱她
The woman I've loved since before I liked girls.

11
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,600
我很想说  坐在她身边的那个人就是我
I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.

12
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,750
唉  能当他也不错
Aw,heck,I'd even take him.

13
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,720
喂  停车
Hey!Stop the bus!

14
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,880
那是我
That's me.

15
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,020
拜托你  叫他停车
Tell him to stop!Please!

16
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,380
停车
Stop!

17
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,780
喂  停车
Hey!Stop the bus!

18
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,090
快停车  他一路在追我们
Stop!He's been chasing us since Woodhaven.

19
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,520
去叫计程车啦  派克
Catch a cab,Parker!

20
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,730
谢了  抱歉我迟到了
Thank you.I'm sorry I'm late.

21
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,440
他真笨啊
What a geek!

22
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,310
-你想都别想  -你真差劲  派克
- Don't even think about it. - You're so lame,Parker.

23
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,070
你会跟他约会吗
Would you date him?

24
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,200
市公立高三生
Midtown High seniors.

25
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,100
别乱跑  直走到  别闹了
No wandering.Proceed direct--Knock it off.

26
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,810
记住  这是个难得的机会
Remember,it is a privilege to be here.

27
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,440
我们是哥伦比亚大学科学院的客人
We're guests of Columbia University's Science Department.

28
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,840
大家乖乖守规矩
So behave accordingly.

29
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,090
别像上次在天文馆一样给我桶篓子
Let's not have a repeat of our trip to the planetarium.

30
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,910
同学们  别走散了
Come on,stay together.

31
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,020
大家一起走进去
Proceed up the steps and into the building.

32
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,230
-你去哪了  -去看图书馆

34
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,500
-我们可以绕到角落去吗  -为什么
- Can we drive around the corner? - Why?

35
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,500
入口就在这里
The entrance is right there.

36
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,340
爸爸  公立高中生不太好坐劳斯莱斯到啦
Dad,this is public school.I can't show up in a Rolls.

37
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,940
就因为你被私立中学退学
I should trade my car for a Jetta...

38
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,880
我就该换辆福士金龟车吗
...because you flunked out of private school?

39
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,220
-那不合我  -这当然合你
- It wasn't for me. - Of course it was.

40
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,220
-千万别以自己为耻  -我才没有
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are. - I'm not ashamed of who I am.

41
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,720
只是
It's just....

42
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
只是什么  哈利
Just what,Harry?

43
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,100
算了
Forget it.

44
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,430

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,310
-这是我爸爸  奥诺曼  -我常听到你的大名
- This is my father,Norman Osborn. - I've heard so much about you.

48
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,010
-很荣幸认识您  -哈利说你对科学颇有研究
- It's an honor,sir. - Harry says you're a science whiz.

49
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,080
我也算是科学家
I'm something of a scientist myself.

50
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,410
我拜读过您那有关纳米的科研报告  真的很棒
I read your research on nanotechnology.Brilliant.

51
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,660
-你看得懂吗  -是的  我还写了份报告
- You understood it? - Yes,I wrote a paper on it.

52
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,360
真令人钦佩  你爸妈一定以你这天才为傲
Impressive.Your parents must be very proud.

53
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,890
-我和叔叔婶婶住  -你们两个  我们走吧
- I live with my aunt and uncle. - Hey,you two!Let's move!

54
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,900
-幸会了  -希望能再见面
- Nice to meet you. - Hope to see you again.

55
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,640
-你爸爸人很好  -只因你是个天才
- He doesn't seem so bad. - Not if you're a genius.

56
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,680
我看他很想领养你
I think he wants to adopt you.

57
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,550
世上有三万两千多种蜘蛛
There are over 32,000 known species of spider in the world.

58
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,550
蜘蛛目之下分为三大类
They're in the order Araneae,divided into three suborders.

59
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,850
好棒啊
That's amazing!

60
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,960
这是西岸最先进的电子显微镜
This is the most advanced electron microscope on the East Coast.

61
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,330
真不敢相信
It's unreal.

62
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,260
所有这些蜘蛛拥有不同的能力
Arachnids from all three groups possess...

63
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,730
帮助它们觅食
...varying strengths to help them search for food.

64
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,440
例如这一种澳洲产的蜘蛛
For example,the Delena spider,family Sparassidae...

65
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,770
它有跳跃的能力去捕食猎物
...has the ability to jump to catch its prey.

66
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,640
我能帮校刊拍一张吗
For the school paper?

67
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,150
只是古库基亚属的
Next,we have the net web spider,family Filistatidae...

68
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,250
非里特帝科的结网蜘蛛
...genus Kukulcania.

69
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,820
它能织出几乎跟
Spins a funnel - shaped web whose strands have a tensile strength...

70
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,330
建筑用钢索一样强韧的漏斗状蜘蛛网
...proportionately equal to the high - tension wires used in bridges.

71
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,430
-离我远一点  -不然会怎样
- Leave him alone. - Or what?

72
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,570
不然的话他老爸就会开除你老爸
Or his father will fire your father.

73
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,370
你老爸能怎样对付我  控告我吗
What's Daddy gonna do?Sue me?

74
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,010
怎么回事
What is going on?

75
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,270
谁再多说话我就给他不合格
The next person who talks will fail this course.

76
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,450
-这种蜘蛛利用  -我们走吧
- This spider... - Let's go.

77
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,810
反射动作猎食  它的反射神经反应非常快
...hunts using reflexes with nerve - conduction velocity so fast...

78
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,560
很多研究员认为它们有预知能力
...that some researchers believe it borders on precognition.

79
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,850
-能提早知道危险  -怪人
- An early awareness of danger. - Jerks.

80
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,460
蜘蛛第六感
A spider - sense.

81
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,120
你看那只蜘蛛
Hey,look at that spider.

82
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,770
有些蜘蛛会随着环境变色
Some spiders change colors to blend into their environment.

83
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,900
这是一种防御机制
It's a defense mechanism.

84
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,370
拜托  谁想知道这些
Peter,what makes you think I'd want to know that?

85
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,700
谁不想呢
Who wouldn't?

86
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,680
这五年来哥大基因研究中
Over five painstaking years,Columbia's research facility....

87
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,250
-你要去找她聊天  -不要啦  你去吧
- You gonna talk to her now? - Oh,no.Come on.You talk to her.

88
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,250
有了这些DNA的基因蓝图  将以往不可能的都变成真
With these DNA blueprints,we have begun what was once thought impossible.

89
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,120
-好恶心  -是啊  真恶心
- Disgusting. - Yeah,hateful little things.

90
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,690
我喜欢
I love them!

91
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
对啊  我也是
Yeah,me too.

92
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,730
你知道  蜘蛛能改变颜色
You know,spiders can change their color...

93
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,770
-以融入自然环境  -真的吗
- ...to blend into their environment. - Really?

94
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,140
-那是一种防御机制  -真酷
- Yeah,it's a defense mechanism. - Cool.

95
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,640
利用合成的核糖核酸去制造全新基因组
- transfer RNA to encode an entirely new genome...

96
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,910
再跟三种蜘蛛的基因结合在一起
...combining the genetic information from all three...

97
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,780
做出这15只超级蜘蛛
...into these 15 genetically designed super - spiders.

98
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,460
只有14只
There's 14.

99
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,290
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

100
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,000
-有一只不见了  -对
- One's missing. - Yeah.

101
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,530
我猜有研究人员拿走了它做实验
I guess the researchers are working on that one.

102
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,770
你知道这是西岸最大的电子显微镜吗
Do you know that this is the largest electron microscope on the East Coast?

103
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,000
她在介绍时  你一直唠叨个不停
You were talking throughout that woman's entire presentation.

104
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,910
让我们谈谈该如何留心倾听
Let's talk about listening.

105
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,080
我不知道在私立学校是怎么样的
I don't know what it's like at those fancy private schools...

106
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,190
但在市公立高中
...but at Midtown High....

107
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,570
能拍张照片吗  我要拍一张有学生的
Could I take your picture?I need one with a student in it.

108
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,470
-当然可以  -太好了
- Sure. - Great.

109
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,540
你要我站哪儿  这儿吗
Where do you want me?Over here?

110
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,070
好啊
Yeah,that's great.

111
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,130
别把我拍得太难看
Don't make me look ugly.

112
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,370
怎么可能
That's impossible.

113
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,650
太完美了
Perfect.

114
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,160
-很好吗  -太棒了
- Is that good? - Great.

115
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,100
太棒了
That's great.

116
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,640
玛莉  我们走吧
M.J.,let's go!

117
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,800
等一下  谢谢
Wait.Thanks!

118
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,060

119
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,500
新品种

120
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,510
[奥氏企业]

121
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,220
我们解决了平行滑翔和重力平衡的问题
We've solved the horizon glide and the balance issues.

122
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,950
我看过滑翔翼了
I've already seen the glider.

123
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,410
我不是为了这件事而来
That's not what I'm here for.

124
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,280
索将军  很高兴再见到你

127
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,060
很高兴董事会能大驾光临
Always a pleasure to have our board of directors visit.

128
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,740
我想看看体能增强计划的报告
I want the report on human performance enhancers.

129
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,380
我们让白老鼠接受汽化吸入测试  它们的体能增强了八倍
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.Their strength increased by 800%.

130
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,410
-太棒了  -有副作用吗
- Excellent. - Any side effects?

131
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,670
只有一次
Once.

132
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,510
其它的测试都很成功
All the tests since have been successful.

133
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,410
在那个出错的试验中  有什么副作用
In the trial that went wrong,what were the side effects?

134
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,950
暴力倾向  具有侵略性
Violence,aggression...

135
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,850
还有疯狂状态
...and insanity.

136
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,790
-你有什么建议  -那只是一次测试
- What do you recommend? - That was only one test.

137
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,890
除了史博士以外  大家都担保
Except for Dr.Stromm,our staff certifies the product...

138
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,000
-可以进行人体实验  -史博士
- ...ready for human testing. - Dr.Stromm?

139
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,000
我们必须把整个研究退回到方程式阶段
We need to take the whole line back to formula.

140
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,610
-退回到方程式阶段重新开始  -奥斯本博士
- Back to formula? - Dr.Osborn.

141
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,610
我老实跟你说
I'll be frank with you.

142
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,680
我从未支持过你的计划  那是前任负责人批准的
I never supported your program.We have my predecessor to thank for that.

143
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,610
索将军将支持探索航太公司
The general has approved Quest Aerospace...

144
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,720
制造人型盔甲的原型
...to build a prototype of their exoskeleton.

145
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,030
-两星期后进行测试  -如果你所谓的体能增强计划
- They test in two weeks. - And if your performance enhancers...

146
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,260
到那时候人体实验还不成功
...have not had a successful human trial by that date...

147
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,870
我就撤销你的研究经费  转给别人做
...I'm gonna pull your funding.I'm going to give it to them.

148
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,300
各位再见
Gentlemen.Ladies.

149
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,820
上帝说  来点光吧  马上就有光亮
And the Lord said,"Let there be light."And voila!There is light.

150
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,140
40瓦特柔和的灯光
Forty soft,glowing watts of it.

151
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,150
好孩子  上帝是会很高兴  不过小心别摔倒了
Good boy.God will be thrilled.Just don't fall on your ass.

152
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,920
我已经倒下了  梅
I'm already on my ass,May.

153
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,760
我这个当了35年的资深技师都被裁员了
When the plant's senior electrician is laid off after 35 years...

154
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,460
这还能算什么  我可是摔到谷底了
...what would you call it?I am on my ass.

155
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,030
把绿色的盘子递给我
Hand me that dish.The green one.

156
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,070
企业目前都在裁员
The corporation is downsizing the people...

157
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,340
以求增加盈利
...and upsizing their profits.

158
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,540
班  你会找到工作的
Oh,Ben,you'll get another job somewhere.

159
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,450
恩  看看报纸上有什么
Well,let's look in the paper and see.

160
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,350
有征人广告  看看有什么工作
There are the want ads.What do we got here?

161
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,150
电脑
Computer....

162
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,120
电脑销售员  电脑工程师  电脑分析师
Computer salesman,computer engineer,computer analyst.

163
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,060
天啊  现在连分析师都要懂电脑
My Lord,even the computers need analysts these days.

164
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,660
我都68岁  老了才学电脑太难  而且还要维持家计
I'm 68.I'm too old for computers,and besides,I have a family to provide for.

165
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,700
我爱你  彼得也爱你
I love you.And Peter loves you.

166
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,240
你是我见过最尽责的男人
You're the most responsible man I've ever known.

167
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,880
我们也苦过呀  还不是撑过来
We've been down - and - out before.But somehow,we survive.

168
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,310
孩子  你正好赶上  赶上晚餐
Hi,sweetie.You're just - Just in time for dinner.

169
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,080
你还好吧  课外活动如何
How you doing?How was the field trip?

170
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,050
我不舒服  我先去睡了
I don't feel well.I'm gonna go to sleep.

171
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,730
-你不吃一点吗  -我吃过了
- You won't have a bite? - Had a bite.

172
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,330
彼得  你有拍照吗
Did you get some pictures,Peter?

173
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,030
我要睡了  我很好
I gotta crash.Everything's fine.

174
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,030
他到底是怎么了
What's that all about?

175
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,490
我们在实验室
In this recombination lab...

176
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,260
利用合成的核糖核酸去制造全新基因组
...we use synthesized transfer RNA to encode an entirely new genome...

177
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,530
再跟三种蜘蛛的基因结合在一起
...combining the genetic information from all three...

178
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,540
做出这15只超级蜘蛛
...into these 15 genetically designed super - spiders.

179
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,990
奥博士  求求你  体能增强计划还没完成
Dr.Osborn,please.The performance enhancers aren't ready.

180
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,490
这次实验结果并不成功
The data just doesn't justify this test.

181
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,290
我最后一次请求你  我们不能这么做
Now,I'm asking you for the last time.We can't do this.

182
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,690
别这么胆小
Don't be a coward.

183
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,760
实验本来就有风险
Risks are part of laboratory science.

184
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,670
让我再另外安排一个医疗人员和自愿者
Let me reschedule,with a medical staff and a volunteer.

185
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,280
-只要给我两星期  -两星期
- Just give me two weeks. - Two weeks?

186
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,980
两星期内  我们拿不到合约  奥氏企业就完了
In two weeks?We'll have lost the contract to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

187
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,910
有时候你只能靠自己
Sometimes you gotta do things yourself.

188
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,750
-给我催化剂  -做什么
- Get me the Promachloraperazine. - For what?

189
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,690
它能让增强剂更快进入血液
It begins catalyzation when the vapor hits the bloodstream.

190
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,250
人类演化了四万年
40,000 years of evolution...

191
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,190
无穷的潜力都还没完全发挥
...and we've barely tapped the vastness of human potential.

192
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,340
喔  真冷
Oh,that's cold.

193
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,030
诺曼
Norman?

194
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,880
诺曼
Norman!

195
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,920
我的天
Oh,my God.

196
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,860
天啊
Oh,my God!

197
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,360
天啊  诺曼
Oh,my God!Norman!

198
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,380
回到方程式重新开始
Back to formula?

199
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,520
怪了
Weird.

200
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,830
-彼得  -嗯
- Peter? - Yeah?

201
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,800
你还好吧
Are you all right?

202
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,300
我很好
I'm fine.

203
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,270
-好一点吗  有改变吗  -改变
- Any better this morning?Any change? - Change?

204
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,180
有很大的改变
Yep.Big change.

205
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,350
-快一点  我们快迟到了  -对
- Well,hurry up.You'll be late. - Right.

206
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,130
好吧
Okay.

207
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,610
-真是的  -我以为你生病了
- Goodness me! - Jeez.I thought you were sick.

208
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,510
-我好多了  -看到了吗
- I got better. - See?

209
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,050
-再见了  -你有带你的午餐钱吗
- Bye,guys. - Have you got your lunch money?

210
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,910
别忘了下课后要回来粉刷厨房
Don't forget,we're painting the kitchen after school.

211
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,880
好呀  班叔叔  我回来前别开始啊
Sure,Uncle Ben.Don't start without me.

212
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,180
别放我鸽子
And don't start up with me.

213
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,420
年青人的荷尔蒙作祟
Teenagers.Raging hormones.They never change.

214
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,100
你是废物  你永远都是废物  跟你妈一样
You're trash!You're always gonna be trash!

215
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,860
-我要去上学了  -谁不让你去上学
- I have to go to school. - Who's stopping you?

216
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,880
嗨  玛莉
Hi,M.J.

217
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,260
嗨  玛莉
Hey,M.J.

218
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,060
也许你不知道  我从6岁起就是你的邻居
I don't know if you realize this,but we've been neighbors since I was 6.

219
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,600
我在想  我可以跟你约会吗
And I was wondering if we could get together sometime?

220
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,330
我有车  上来吧
I got the car.Hop in.

221
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,130
一起出去玩玩  我不确定
Do something fun?Or,I don't know.

222
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,170
我觉得是多彼此了解的时候了
I thought it'd be time to get to know each other.

223
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,670
不要也行
Or not.

224
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,850
对不起  巴士满了
Sorry,Parker,the bus is full!

225
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,920
-停车  -坐出租车吧
- Stop the bus! - Catch a cab!

226
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,980
叫他停车
Tell him to stop.

227
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,600
-看  -白痴
- Check him out! - Dork!

228
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,380
爸爸

229
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,720
爸爸  你没事吧
Dad,are you all right?

230
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,820
哈利
Harry.

231
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,160
你躺在地上干嘛
What are you doing on the floor?

232
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,690
我不知道
I don't know.

233
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,830
你整晚都躺在地上吗
Have you been there all night?

234
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,100
昨晚我
Last night I was -

235
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,670

-我忘了  -奥斯本先生
- I don't remember. - Mr.Osborn?

237
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,240
先生  我叫她等一下的
Sir,I asked her to wait.

238
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,780
-我父亲不舒服  -奥先生  史博士死了
- My father's not feeling well  - Mr.Osborn,Dr.Stromm is dead.

239
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,950
什么
What?

240
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,680
在实验室找到他的尸体  是谋杀
They found his body in the lab.He's been murdered,sir.

241
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,260

245
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,200
嘿  你原来有蓝眼珠  戴了眼镜都没有注意到
Hey,you have blue eyes.I didn't notice without your glasses.

246
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,590
换了隐形眼镜吗
You just get contacts?

247
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,500
回头见
Well,see you.

250
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,880
派克

256
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,560
他是怎么做到的
How'd he do that?

257
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,860
该帮谁呀
Which one?

258
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,460

261
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,830
真是惊人
That was amazing.

262
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,730
我要走了  走吧
I'm out of here.Come on.

263
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,560
去  网子
Go,web!

264
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,190
飞啊
Fly.

265
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,830

728
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:09,200
我想送你一些东西

742
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,560
我不知道
I don't know.

743
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,290
不管是什么  一定要阻止他
Whatever it is,somebody has to stop it.

744
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:28,040
有人在吗
Somebody there?Somebody.

745
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:30,640
当然有人
Somebody.

746
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:33,020
是谁说的

01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:51,830
跟着那股直冲你脑门的寒意
Follow the cold shiver running down your spine.

751
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,510
我就在那儿
I'm right here.

752
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,180
我不明白
I don't understand.

753
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:08,380
以为这全是巧合吗
Did you think it was coincidence?

754
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:12,180
你身上发生这么多好事
So many good things,all happening for you.

755
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:16,020
这全是为了你  诺曼

756
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:20,000
你想要什么

757
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,570
说你不敢说的

758
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,430
做你不敢做的

770

771
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:11,110
只有一个人能阻止我们
There's only one who can stop us.

772
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:15,390
也许他能加入我们

绿坏蛋如何
How about "Green Meanie"?

779
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,350
蜘蛛侠没有攻击别人  这是恶意中伤

-说来就来  -我就知道你们是同党
- Speak of the devil. - I knew you two were in this together!

793
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,790
大人说话  小孩不可插嘴
Kiddo,let Mom and Dad talk for a minute.

794
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,470
安睡吧
Sleep....

795
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:53,920
醒来吧  小蜘蛛  醒来
Wake up,little spider.Wake up.

796
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:58,490
放心  你没死  还没有
No,you're not dead yet.

797
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,890
你只是暂时
Just paralyzed...

798
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,030
被麻痹了
...temporarily.

799
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,120
你真的很不可思议  蜘蛛侠
You're an amazing creature,Spider - Man.

800
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:10,030
你和我是那么的相像
You and I are not so different.

801
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:14,040
我跟你不同  你是个杀人凶手
I'm not like you.You're a murderer.

802
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,170
只是人各有志
Well,to each his own.

803
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,280
这是我的选择  而你选择当超级英雄
I chose my path,you chose the way of the hero.

804
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:25,540
大众对你只有三分钟热度
And they found you amusing for a while,the people of this city.

805
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:29,020
他们最想看到的是
But the one thing they love more than a hero...

806
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:32,780
英雄的失败  殒落和死亡
...is to see a hero fail,fall,die trying.

807
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:37,590
不管你替他们做了多少好事  最后他们都只会憎恨你
In spite of everything you've done for them,eventually,they will hate you.

808
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:38,730
那又何必呢
Why bother?

809
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:43,700
-因为这是对的  -事实是这样子的
- Because it's right. - Here's the real truth.

810
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,110
纽约有八百万市民
There are eight million people in this city.

811
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,670
他们的存在只有一个作用
And those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose...

812
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:55,780
把少数杰出的天才举在他们肩上
...of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders.

813
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,380
像是你  我
You,me...

814
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,850
这种天才
...we're exceptional.

815
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:04,750
我大可以一脚把你踩扁
I could squash you like a bug right now.

816
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:08,650
但我给你一个选择  加入我
But I'm offering you a choice.Join me.

817
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:12,420
想像一下我们可以共同完成的大事
Imagine what we could accomplish together.

818
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:15,400
可以开创未来
What we could create.

819
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,940
还是我们可以大肆破坏
Or we could destroy.

820
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:22,110
为了你所谓的理想  死伤无辜百姓
Cause the deaths of countless innocents in selfish battle...

821
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:27,240
直到我们双方倒下为止  这才是你想要的吗
...again and again and again until we're both dead.Is that what you want?

822
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,080
想想看吧  大英雄
Think about it,hero.

823
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,620
蜘蛛侠和绿恶魔狼狈为奸

824
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:41,690
全面通缉

825
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:49,400
不管你替他们做了多少好事  最后他们都只会憎恨你
In spite of everything you've done for them,eventually,they will hate you.

826
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,070
市民呼吁当局扑灭害虫

827
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:01,210
又是我
It's me again.

828
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,010
你的试镜如何
How was your audition?

829
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,180
-你怎么知道  -我的消息灵通  你妈妈
- How'd you know? - The hot line.Your mom...

830
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:08,320
跟我婶婶说的  婶婶跟我说的
...told my aunt,told me.

831
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,120
你是来看我吗
So you just came by?

832
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:13,950
我正好路过  想看一下可爱的面孔
I was in the neighborhood.Needed to see a friendly face.

833
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:18,720
我坐公车和计程车大老远跑来
I took two buses and a cab to get in the neighborhood,but....

834
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,470
试镜如何
So how'd it go?

835
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,190
他们叫我再回去上演技课
They said I needed acting lessons.

836
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:29,170
肥皂剧要我去上演技课
A soap opera told me I needed acting lessons.

837
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:34,680
我请你吃汉堡  价钱上限到7.84元
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.The sky's the limit,up to $7.84.

838
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:37,040
我很想吃
I'd like a cheeseburger.

839
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:41,990
不过我要跟哈利约了吃晚饭
Oh,but I'm going out to dinner with Harry.

840
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,820
一起来吧
Come with us.

841
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:46,750
不  谢了  你们之间如何
No,thanks.How's it going with...?

842
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:51,160
算了  不关我的事
Never mind.That's none of my business.

843
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:53,170
是吗
It's not?

844
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,260
那你干嘛这么关心
Why so interested?

845
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,400
我没有
I'm not.

846
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:00,040
你没有
You're not?

847
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:04,400
-我干嘛要关心  -我不知道
- Well,why would I be? - I don't know.

848
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,470
为什么
Why would you be?

849
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,710
我  我不知道
I,that's a -

850
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:12,380
我不知道
I don't know.

851
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,420
可惜你不跟我们一起来
Sorry you won't come with us.

852
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,860
我要走了
I'd better run,tiger.

853
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,540
嘿  看
Hey,check it out,man.

854
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,400
别走  美女

855
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,160
你去哪儿  美女  来嘛

你好像有惹上麻烦的习惯
You have a knack for getting in trouble.

859
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,060
而你也好像有救我的习惯  超级英雄来当我的保镖
You have a knack for saving my life.I think I have a superhero stalker.

860
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:50,160
我刚巧在附近
I was in the neighborhood.

861
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:54,600
你真厉害
You are amazing.

862
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:58,340
有些人不这么想
Some people don't think so.

863
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,380
-你真的很棒  -有仰慕者真好
- But you are. - Nice to have a fan.

864
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,350

865
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,790
等等
Wait.

866
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,880
我要进去救我的孩子

-让我进去  -屋顶就快塌了

-谁来救救我的孩子  -屋顶就快塌了
- Somebody save my baby! - The roof's about to collapse!

869

870

873
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:15,230
上帝保佑你  蜘蛛侠
God bless you,Spider - Man.Bless you.

874
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:17,190
别让他跑掉
Don't let him get away!

875
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:20,630
等等  你被捕了  我要带你回警局
Hold it!You're under arrest.I'm taking you in.

876
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:24,130
天啊  还有人在上面
Oh,my God,there's somebody still up there!

877
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,860
我要去救人

我会把你救出去
I'm gonna get you out of here!

883
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,230
没事了
It's okay.

884
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:08,900
你一点新意也没有
You're pathetically predictable.

885
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:10,980
老是飞蛾扑火
Like a moth to the flame.

886
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,280
我的提议怎么样
What about my generous proposal?

887
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:18,180
你想不想加入我
Are you in or are you out?

888
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:24,330
-我看你是丧心病狂了  -答错了
- It's you who's out.Out of your mind. - Wrong answer.

893
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:24,490
好了吗
Are you ready?

894
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:28,980
梅婶  抱歉迟到了
Aunt May.I'm sorry I'm late.

895
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:32,290
工作忙得要命  我带了水果蛋糕来
Work was murder.I picked up a fruitcake.

-感恩节快乐  -彼得呢
- Happy Thanksgiving,sir. - Now,where is Peter?

901
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:52,710
他最好记得买红莓酱
He'd better remember that cranberry sauce.

902
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,010
奇怪  我不知道他在家
Oh,that's weird.I didn't know he was here.

903
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,530
彼得
Peter?

904
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,300
是你吗
Is that you?

905
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:25,940
是你吗
How strange.There's nobody here.

906
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:36,890
-他有点邋遢  不是吗  -天才都是这样
- Bit of a slob,isn't he? - All brilliant men are.

907

-大家好  -彼得
- Hey,everyone. - Oh,Peter!

908
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:14,020
外面真是混乱
It's a jungle out there.

909
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:18,100
我好不容易才买到酱
Had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries.

910
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,400
谢谢  现在  请大家坐下吧
Thank you.Now then,everybody sit down...

911

让我们祷告
...and we can say grace.

912
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,440

915
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:58,770
怎么了  彼特  你在流血
Why,Peter,you're bleeding.

916
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:06,950
我走在街上  被个骑脚踏车的撞伤了
I stepped off a curb and got clipped by one of those bike messengers.

917
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,650
让我看看
Well,let me see.

918
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:10,410

919
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:13,020
-看起来很严重  -没什么
- That looks awful. - No,it's nothing.

920
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,320
我去拿急救箱  接着再来祷告
I'll get the first - aid kit.Then we'll say grace.

921
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:21,830
你们第一次在这儿过感恩节  我们要照规矩来
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving here,and we'll do things properly.

922
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:25,300
你是怎么受伤的
How did you say that happened?

923
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:27,000
骑脚踏车的
Bike messenger.

924
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:30,210
把我撞伤了
Knocked me down.

925
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,360
-不好意思  我得走了  -为什么
- If you'll excuse me,I've got to go. - Why?

926
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,550
我突然想到一件事
Something has come to my attention.

927
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,130
你没事吧
Are you all right?

928

-请享用水果蛋糕  -爸爸
- Enjoy the fruitcake. - Dad!

930
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:57,840
我想让你多认识玛莉  但你现在却要离开
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,and now you have to leave?

931
01:28:58,110 --> 01:28:59,770
我得走了
I've got to go.

932
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:04,170
-她对我很重要  -拜托你看清楚一点
- This girl is important to me. - Harry,please.Look at her.

933
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:08,350
你以为她是真的喜欢你吗
Think she's sniffing around because she likes your personality?

934
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:11,590
-你在说什么  -你妈妈也很漂亮
- What are you saying? - Your mother was beautiful.

935
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:17,160
她们都很漂亮  直到一闻到钱就变成豺狼
They're all beautiful until they're snarling after your money like wolves.

936
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,690
你错了  爸爸
You're wrong,Dad.

937
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:22,360
给你一个忠告怎对女友
A word to the not - so - wise about your girlfriend:

938
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:26,440
把她弄到手了就甩掉她
Do what you need to with her,then broom her fast.

939
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:39,380
谢谢你帮我辩解  哈利
Thanks for sticking up for me,Harry.

940
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:42,550
-你都听到了  -全部人都听到那混蛋说的话了
- You heard? - Everyone heard that creep.

941
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:46,620
他可是我老爸  我只恨我什么也比不上他
That creep is my father.With luck,I'll be half of what he is.

942
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:49,190
你不懂就别乱说
Shut up about stuff you don't understand!

943
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,060
奥哈利
Harry Osborn!

944
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:54,160
对不起
I'm sorry,Aunt May.

945
01:29:57,170 --> 01:30:00,440
蜘蛛侠是战无不胜的
Spider - Man is all but invincible.

946
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:03,800
但是我们能毁了彼得
But Parker,we can destroy him.

947
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,310
我办不到
I can't.

948
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:08,450
我绝不容许背叛的行为
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

949
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,980
一定要给他一点教训
Parker must be educated.

950
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:14,480
我该怎么做
What do I do?

951
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:18,750
教教他什么是痛苦和失去
Instruct him in the matters of loss and pain.

952
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,280
让他受苦  让他生不如死
Make him suffer.Make him wish he were dead.

953
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,490
然后呢
Yes?

954
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,600
然后再杀了他
And then grant his wish.

955
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:27,790
怎么做
But how?

956
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:32,300
聪明人不会直接攻击敌人
The cunning warrior attacks neither body nor mind.

957
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:33,660
快教我
Tell me how!

958
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:36,000
你要攻心
The heart,Osborn.

959
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:38,340
先向他的亲人下手
First,we attack his heart.

960
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,720
赐给我们今天的食物  原谅我们的过错
Give us this day our daily bread,and forgive us our trespasses...

961
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:47,890
也让我们原谅别人的过错
...as we forgive those who trespass against us.

962
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:51,990
别让我们受到诱惑  拯救我们
Lead us not into temptation,but deliver us -

963
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:02,260
拯救我们
Deliver us!

964
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,830
快说完
Finish it!

965
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:08,070
-快说完  -不受恶魔侵犯
- Finish it! - From evil!

966
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:15,940
两毫克的静脉注射
Two milligrams IV.

967
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:18,980
去拿血压计来
Get the BP.

968
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,010
梅婶怎么了  她没事吧
Aunt May.Is she gonna be okay?What happened?

969
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:24,550
请你出去
You have to leave.

970
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,420
-怎么了  -好可怕的双眼
- What happened? - Those eyes!

971
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,660
可怕的黄色眼晴
Those horrible yellow eyes!

972
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:38,040
他知道我是谁
He knows who I am.

973
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,570
对不起
I'm sorry.

974
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:29,790
-她还好吧  -她会没事的
- Will she be okay? - She'll be fine.

975
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:32,580
她整天都在睡
She's been sleeping all day.

976
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:36,360
-谢谢你来探望她  -当然
- Thanks for coming. - Of course.

977
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,430
你还好吧  我是说那晚
How are you?You okay about the other night?

978
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:47,270
我很好  我不该丢下梅婶
Yeah,I'm fine.I just felt bad about leaving Aunt May.

979
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:50,510
-你跟哈利谈过吗  -他打过电话给我
- Have you talked to Harry? - He called me.

980
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:53,100
我还没打回去
I haven't called him back.

981
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,940
事实上
The fact is...

982
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:00,920
-我爱上另一个人了  -真的吗
- ...I'm in love with somebody else. - You are?

983
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:03,280
至少我认为是这样
At least I think I am.

984
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:07,980
-现在谈不太好  -不会的  说吧
- It's not the time to talk about it. - No.Go on.

985
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,420
他叫什么
Would I know his name,this guy?

986
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:14,500
你一定觉得我很傻
You'll think I'm a little girl with a crush.

987
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:16,070
尽管说吧
Trust me.

988
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:17,560
很好笑
It's funny.

989
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,510
他救了我两次  但我却没见过他的脸
He's saved my life twice,and I've never even seen his face.

990
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:27,080
-原来是他  -你在嘲笑我
- Oh.Him. - You're laughing at me.

991
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:30,280
没有  我知道  他真的很酷
No,I understand.He is extremely cool.

992
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:34,780
你觉得他们说的那些坏事是真的吗
But do you think it's true,all the terrible things they say?

993
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:37,820
不是  蜘蛛侠绝对不是坏人
Not Spider - Man,not a chance in the world.

994
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:39,620
我算是认识他
I know him a little bit.

995
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:42,730
我是他非正式的摄影师
I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.

996
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,060
-他有提到过我吗  -有啊
- Has he mentioned me? - Yeah.

997
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,860
他怎么说
What'd he say?

998
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,800
我说
I said....

999
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:55,170
他问我觉得你怎么样
He asked me what I thought about you.

1000
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,140
你怎么说
And what did you say?

1001
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:02,940
我说  蜘蛛侠
I said,"Spider - Man."

1002
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:08,180
我说  玛莉最大的优点
I said,"The great thing about M.J...

1003
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:09,820
是
...is...

1004
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,840
当你看着她的双眼
...when you look in her eyes...

1005
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:19,810
而她也注视着你时
...and she's looking back in yours...

1006
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,800
一切好像都
...everything feels...

1007
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,870
变得特别了
...not quite normal.

1008
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,940
因为你会同时
Because you feel...

1009
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,100
感到更坚强
...stronger...

1010
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:37,240
而同时也更软弱
...and weaker at the same time.

1011
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,440
你会感到兴奋
You feel excited...

1012
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:42,390
同时也会感到
...and at the same time...

1013
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,620
害怕
...terrified.

1014
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:52,190
你也不大清楚那是什么感觉
The truth is,you don't know what you feel...

1015
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:57,260
只知道你想成什么样的人
...except you know what kind of man you want to be.

1016
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:01,870
就像是完成了
It's as if you've...

1017
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:05,670
遥不可及的梦想
...reached the unreachable...

1018
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:09,980
却一点也没有准备好
...and you weren't ready for it."

1019
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,220
这是你说的
You said that?

1020
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,290
差不多是这样
Well,something like that.

1021
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:04,100
爸爸
Dad?

1022
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:11,500
爸爸  是你吗
Dad,is that you?

1023
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,620
怎么了
What is it?

1024
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,820
你没看错玛莉  你都说对了
You were right about M.J.You're right about everything.

1025
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:30,560
她爱上彼得了
She's in love with Peter.

1026
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:32,660
-派克吗  -是
- Parker? - Yeah.

1027
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,960
他爱不爱她
And how does he feel about her?

1028
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,930
他从四年级就暗恋她了
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1029
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:46,140
他装作没有  不过彼特根本没有爱过其它人
He pretends like he doesn't,but there's no one Peter cares for more.

1030
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,810
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1031
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,070
我都没有好好陪你
I haven't always been there for you,have I?

1032
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,690
你很忙  你是重要人物  我了解
You're busy.You're an important man.I understand.

1033
01:37:01,930 --> 01:37:03,660
这不是借口
That's no excuse.

1034
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,490
我为你感到骄傲
I'm proud of you.

1035
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:11,870
我不该冷落你  我会补偿你的
I've lost sight of that somewhere.But I'll make it up to you.

1036
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,400
我要替你讨回公道
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.

1037
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:31,280
醒来  小蜘蛛
Wake up,little spider.

1038
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:32,920
醒来
Wake up.

1039
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,850
回家吧  亲爱的
Go home,dear.

1040
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,360
你看来遭透了
You look awful.

1041
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:39,890
-你看来美极了  -谢谢
- And you look beautiful. - Thank you.

1042
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:43,360
-我不想丢下你  -我很安全
- I don't like to leave you here. - But I'm safe here.

1043
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,300
-我能为你做什么  -你做的够多了
- Can I do anything for you? - You do too much.

1044
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:52,000
半工半读还得陪我  你又不是超人
College,a job,all this time with me.You're not Superman,you know.

1045
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:54,510
你终于笑了
A smile.Finally.

1046
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:58,950
自从玛莉走了之后就没看你笑过了
Haven't seen one of those on your face since Mary Jane was here.

1047
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:01,450
你应该是睡着的
You were supposed to be asleep.

1048
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:07,090
玛莉搬到隔壁你才六岁
You know,you were about 6 years old when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1049
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:11,230
当她下车时  你一看到她
When she got out of the car,and you saw her for the first time...

1050
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:17,730
你就抓着我说  梅婶  她是天使吗
...you grabbed me and said,"Aunt May,is that an angel?"

1051
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,460
-我这么说吗  -当然了
- Gee,did I say that? - You sure did.

1052
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,940
喔  可是哈利爱她
Well,Harry's in love with her.

1053
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:30,730
-她仍然是他的女友  -那不是她的决定是吗
- She's still his girl. - Well,isn't that up to her?

1054
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:35,550
-她并不了解我  -因为你不让她了解你
- She doesn't really know who I am. - Because you won't let her.

1055
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,980
你总是这么内向
You're so mysterious all the time.

1056
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,990
告诉我  让她知道你有多喜欢她
Tell me,would it be so dangerous...

1057
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:46,160
有什么关系呢
...to let Mary Jane know how much you care?

1058
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,170
大家都看得出来
Everybody else knows.

1059
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,430
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

1060
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:55,370
但是
But....

1061
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,650
快接呀
Come on,pick up.

1062
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:08,150
-嗨  玛莉  -听到哔声请留言
- Hey M.J. - Hi.Sing your song at the beep.

1063
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:11,280
玛莉  我是彼得  你在吗
M.J.,it's Peter.You there?

1064
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:14,390
喂  你在吗
Hello?You there?

1065
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:19,330
我想知道你可好  给我回电  好吗
I'm just calling to check up on you.Will you call me when you get in?

1066
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,960
好吧
All right,well....

1067
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:22,430
别走
Don't....

1068
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:25,430
别走暗巷
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1069
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,140
喂
Hello?

1070
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:33,270
蜘蛛侠能出来玩吗
Can Spider - Man come out to play?

1071
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:35,210
她在哪儿
Where is she?

1072
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,150
-那是什么  -真酷
- What is that? - That's cool!

1073
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:27,990
这只小蜘蛛跑到喷泉旁
The itsy - bitsy spider Went up the water spout

1074
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:32,330
马上就被绿恶魔杀光光
Down came the goblin And took the spider out

1075
01:40:49,190 --> 01:40:50,850
绿恶魔  你干了什么
Goblin,what have you done?

1076
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:37,500
蜘蛛侠  这就是为什么傻瓜才会去当英雄
Spider - Man!This is why only fools are heroes.

1077
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,160
因为你永远不知道
Because you never know...

1078
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:44,170
哪一天哪个疯子会出个残酷的难题
...when some lunatic will come along with a sadistic choice:

1079
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:48,040
让你选心爱的女人死
Let die the woman you love...

1080
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:57,170
还是让无辜的小孩死
...or suffer the little children.

1081
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,900
-蜘蛛侠  -救我们
- Spider - Man! - Save us!

1082
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:04,200
救我们

快决定吧  蜘蛛侠
Make your choice,Spider - Man...

1084
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:11,370
当一个英雄就是要付出代价
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1085
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,630
别这样做  绿恶魔
Don't do it,Goblin!

1086
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:16,710
他们的命运掌握在你手上
We are who we choose to be.

1087
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,710
-现在  选吧  -不
- Now,choose! - No!

1088
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:50,000
大家抓稳了
Everybody stay still!

1089
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:00,880
嘿  上面的
Ahoy up there!

1090
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:03,920
我们要把船开到你的正下方
We're gonna bring the barge right under you.

1091
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:15,560
-他又回来了  -听好  我要你爬下去
- He's coming back! - Listen.I need you to climb down.

1092
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,350
-我做不到  -你可以的
- I can't. - Yes,you can!

1093
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:25,160
玛莉  你可以做到  而你必须做
M.J.,you can do it.You have to.

1094
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:27,140
相信我
Trust me.

1095
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:32,450
抓紧  快下去
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1096
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:39,250
-快  -我做不到
- Hurry! - I can't.I can't do it.

1097
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:40,680
抓紧了  玛莉
Hang on,Mary Jane!

1098
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:11,810
-他不行了  -他行的
- He's not gonna make it. - He's gonna make it!

1099
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:24,900
死亡的时间到了
It's time to die.

1100
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:35,740
-这个是给你的  -我们应该狠狠揍你
- I got something for you! - We ought to kick your ass!

1101
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:39,320
别惹蜘蛛侠  你在对付救小孩的人
Leave Spider - Man alone!You'd pick on a guy saving kids?

1102
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:43,490
你敢惹蜘蛛侠就是惹上全纽约的人
You mess with Spidey,you mess with New York!

1103
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,250
你惹上他就得对付我们全部
You mess with one of us,you mess with all of us!

1104
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:01,700
蜘蛛侠  小心
Spider - Man,watch out!

1105
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,640
你选择了悲惨的命运
Misery,misery,misery.That's what you've chosen.

1106
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:41,170
我把你当朋友
I offered you friendship...

1107
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:43,240
你却不屑一顾
...and you spat in my face.

1108
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,960
没戏唱了  蜘蛛侠
You've spun your last web,Spider - Man.

1109
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:41,440
如果你没这么自私  我就让你的小女友
Had you not been so selfish,your girlfriend's death...

1110
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:43,330
死得痛快
...would have been quick.

1111
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:46,910
但是现在你把我惹火了
But now that you've really pissed me off...

1112
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:52,080
我要慢慢地把她折磨到死
...I'm gonna finish her nice and slow.

1113
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:57,690
我和玛莉
M.J.and I...

1114
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:02,790
一定会玩得很开心
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1115
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,150
彼得  住手
Peter,stop!

1116
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:00,820
住手  是我
Stop!It's me.

1117
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,160
奥先生
Mr.Osborn.

1118
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:12,950
幸好是你
Thank God for you.

1119
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:15,460
你杀死了在阳台上的那些人
You killed those people on that balcony.

1120
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:17,700
是绿恶魔干的  与我无关
The Goblin killed!I had nothing to do with it!

1121
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,630
别  别让心魔再控制我
Don't let him take me again.

1122
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:21,840
求求你  保护我
I beg you.Protect me.

1123
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:26,530
是你想杀死梅婶和玛莉
You tried to kill Aunt May.You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1124
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:28,250
但我没想过要杀你
But not you.

1125
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:32,880
我想阻止心魔  却阻止不了
I tried to stop it.But I couldn't stop it.

1126
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:35,180
我绝不会伤害你
I would never hurt you.

1127
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:37,350
我早就知道
I knew from the beginning...

1128
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:40,460
要是我出事
...if anything ever happened to me...

1129
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,750
你一定会帮助我
...it was you I could count on.

1130
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,230
你  彼得派克  一定会救我  你果然做到了
You,Peter Parker,would save me,and so you have.

1131

谢天谢地

1132
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:51,100

01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:55,710
相信我  就像我相信你一样
Believe in me as I believed in you.

1134
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,910
我就像是你的父亲
I've been like a father to you.

1135
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:03,110
当我的儿子吧
Be a son to me now.

1136
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:06,780
我只有一个父亲

1137
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:10,090
他的名字是班派克
His name was Ben Parker.

1138
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,360
永别了  蜘蛛侠

1139
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:33,840
彼得

1140
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:38,050
别告诉哈利
Don't tell Harry.

1141
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:11,410
你做了什么
What have you done?

1142
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:13,140
你做了什么
What have you done?!

1143
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:42,380
我很抱歉  哈利
I'm so sorry,Harry.

1144
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:47,410
我知道失去父亲时的感受
I know what it's like to lose a father.

1145
01:50:49,690 --> 01:50:52,890
我没失去他  他是被夺走的
I didn't lose him.He was stolen from me.

1146
01:50:54,530 --> 01:50:56,720
总有一天  蜘蛛侠会付出代价
One day Spider - Man will pay.

1147
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:01,720
我发誓要让蜘蛛侠付出代价

1149
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:11,740
你是我唯一的亲人
You're the only family I have.

1150
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:38,570
不管我怎么做
No matter what I do...

1151
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,860
怎么努力
...no matter how hard I try...

1152
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:46,270
我最爱的人都会付出代价
...the ones I love will always be the ones who pay.

1153
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:48,280
班派克之墓  受人敬爱的丈夫和叔叔

1154
01:51:57,090 --> 01:51:59,350
你一定很想念他
You must miss him so much.

1155
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:03,350
失去他很难过
It's been so hard without him.

1156
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:09,160
我一直想跟你说一件事
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.

1157
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,770
当我在桥上
When I was up there...

1158
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:16,270
我以为自己快死了
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1159
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:20,740
我心里只想念一个他
...there was only one person who I was thinking of.

1160
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:26,240
但他不是我一直以为会想到的人
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1161
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:30,120
可他是你  彼得
It was you,Pete.

1162
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:32,890
我一直在想
I kept thinking:

1163
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,090
如果我可以活下来
"I hope I make it through this...

1164
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:41,930
好让我再见彼得派克一面
...so I can see Peter Parker's face one more time."

1165
01:52:43,370 --> 01:52:44,800
真的吗
Really?

1166
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:50,970
只有一个人自始至终陪着我
There's only one man who's always been there for me...

1167
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:54,240
让我觉得
...who makes me feel...

1168
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:58,340
我远比自己想像的好很多
...like I'm more than I ever thought I could be.

1169
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:02,180
我就是
That I'm just...

1170
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:04,320
我
...me.

1171
01:53:05,490 --> 01:53:07,320
而且感觉很好
And that's okay.

1172
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:10,990
事实是
The truth is...

1173
01:53:13,170 --> 01:53:14,890
我爱你
...I love you.

1174
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:18,970
我好爱你  彼得
I love you so much,Peter.

1175
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:44,460
我很想跟她说我有多爱她
All I wanted was to tell her how much I loved her.

1176
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:46,530
但我不能
I can't....

1177
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:50,200
你不能什么
You can't what?

1178
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:52,800
告诉你
Tell you...

1179
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:58,770
一切  我的意思是  太多事情了
...everything.I mean,there's so much to tell.

1180
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:03,850
对啊  有太多事要讲了
Yeah.There's so much to tell.

1181
01:54:04,850 --> 01:54:06,750
我要你知道
I want you to know...

1182
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:09,020
我会永远陪着你
...that I will always be there for you.

1183
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:12,960
我也会永远照顾你
I will always be there to take care of you.

1184
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:16,930
我向你保证
I promise you that.

1185
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:22,560
我会永远是你的朋友
I will always be your friend.

1186
01:54:25,570 --> 01:54:27,370
只是朋友吗
Only a friend...

1187
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:29,800
彼得派克
...Peter Parker?

1188
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:34,810
我只能给你这么多
That's all I have to give.

1189
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:03,830
不管我的未来怎样走
Whatever life holds in store for me...

1190
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:06,070
我永远忘不了这句话
...I will never forget these words.:

1191
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:10,980
能力愈大  责任愈重
"With great power comes great responsibility."

1192
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:14,580
这是我的天赋
This is my gift.

1193
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:16,850
也是我的诅咒
My curse.

1194
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:19,250
我是谁
Who am I?

1195
01:55:19,690 --> 01:55:20,990
我是蜘蛛侠
I'm Spider - Man.
