别低估我的常识

没了? 是吗?
Nothing. Really? Hmm.

23
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,120
那报告简直胡扯 (我的奋斗)
That paper Bob it's a travesty.

24
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,164
辨称希特勒是民权英雄?
Arguing for Hitler as a civil-rights hero?

25
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,749
你该订范围
You've gotta draw the line.

26
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,001
你自找的麻烦
Murray you actually did this to yourself.

27
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,629
叫他们写任何一本...
You told them they could do a report on any book...

28
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,007
...争取民权的读书心得 用直白语言
...that related to the struggle for civil rights. In plain English.

29
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,007
我知道这孩子有点迷失
I am not disputing the fact that the child is confused

30

有些不当思想...

31
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,641
...但我不想放弃他
...but I am not ready to give up on him yet.

32
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,436
也许是他哥教唆的
His brother probably put him up to it.

33
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,606
跟你保证绝不是他哥
I can guarantee you 100 percent his brother did not put him up to this.

34
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,109
那我不太相信
I find that hard to believe. Whatever.

他是好孩子 也很可怜...
I know he was a good kid and it's a shame what he's been through...

36
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,781
- ...但这太危险了 - 哪里危险?
- ...but that is dangerous. - Dangerous in what way?

37
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,617
写得太过火了
Bob that goes too far.

38
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,413
宣扬种族歧视? 纳粹洗脑法?
This racist propaganda this Mein Kampf psychobabble?

39
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,499
可被灌输 也可以清醒
He learned this nonsense Murray and he can unlearn it too.

40
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,335
我不放弃这孩子
I will not give up on this child yet.

要我怎办 丹尼?
What's it gonna be Danny?

46
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,164
什么怎办?
What's what gonna be?

47
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,750
你做的这个好事
This petty crap you're pulling.

48
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,753
不知道
I don't know.

49
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,463

Have a seat.

50
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,554

52
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,602
家里好吗?
Things at home okay?

53
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,979
好
Yeah.

54
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,276
德瑞早上回家了?

55
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,280
对 回来了
Yeah he did.

56
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,784
他曾是我学生 你知道 是吗?
He was one of my students. You knew that right?

57
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,621
荣誉学生 非常聪明
Honors English. He was a brilliant student.

58
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,959
像你一样 但他交一群脑筋简单的朋友
Like you. But he hung out with simple-minded fools.

59
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,294
也跟你一样
Also like you.

60
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,922
叫我来是谈德瑞?
Look did you bring me in here to talk about Derek?

61
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,299
他的事跟我无关
Because what happened to him has nothing to do with me.

62
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,970
你现在所作所为都跟他有关
Everything you do right now has something to do with Derek.

63
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,722
这报告我写得很棒
Look I followed directions and I wrote an A paper.

64
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,976
"我的奋斗"?

67
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,487
这精彩的文宣救不了你
Your rhetoric and your propaganda aren't gonna save you out there.

68
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,907

00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,473
我花了一周看"我的奋斗" 不公平
Oh come on. It took me a week to read Mein Kampf. That isn't fair.

77
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,445
- 你要我写什么? - 写你哥
- What do you want me to do it on? - Your brother.

78
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,865
老天 你开玩笑
Oh God man. Please tell me you're joking.

79

00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,394

92
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,202
清楚了
Yeah I'm clear.

00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,739
背后全是他在掌控
Trust me. He's behind all of it.

140
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,200
活动都在他家外面进行
He runs everything out of his house down by the beach.

141
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,913
开曼和温亚结合后 维尼斯才有了白人帮派
No white gangs in Venice Beach before Cameron Alexander and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

142
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,083
开曼发现德瑞是个人才
Alexander found in Derek his shining prince.

143
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,254
就利用他召集一群...

144
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,422
...没安全感 易受影响的孩子
...frustrated and impressionable kids.

145
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,260
温亚有很重的包袱...
This kid Vinyard well he's got a lot of baggage...

146
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,389
...在这卷NBC带子里 可以看得出
...as you'll see in this tape that we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

147
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,023
本郡消防员旦尼温亚...
L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard...

148
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,694
...在康顿区毒窟救火时被枪杀
...was shot and kilied battling a blaze at a suspected Compton drug den.

149
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,612
记者正在温亚家...
We're at the Vinyard home right now...

150
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,783
温亚的大儿子 德瑞 愿接受访问
...and lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek has agreed to talk with us.

151
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,745
德瑞 请下来一下好吗?
Derek if you could come down here please for just a second.

152
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,791
请谈谈你现在的感觉
Look I know this is tough but um how do you feel right now?

153
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,460
你说呢 什么感觉?
How do you think I feel?

154
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,840
- 这是个象征 - 象征 为什么?
- I think it's typical. - Typical how?

155
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,719
这国家成了犯罪者天堂 你还指望什么?
This country's becoming a haven for criminals so what do you expect?

156
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,138
像我爸这样辛勤的人...
Decent hardworking Americans like my dad...

157
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,391
...被社会寄生虫掠夺一切
...are getting rubbed out by social parasites.

158
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,226
寄生虫?
Parasites?

159
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,897
那些黑人 棕色人 黄人
Blacks browns yellow whatever.

160
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,189
我没搞明白
I don't understand.

161
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,483
你是说他的死跟种族有关?
You're saying your father's murder was race-related?

162
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,485
对 种族问题
Yeah it's race-related.

163
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,281
不仅仅是犯罪 所有问题都因为种族
Every problem in this country is race-related not just crime.

164
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,201
移民 爱滋 福利 都是黑人社会...
lmmigration AlDS welfare. Those are problems of the black community...

165
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,330
...拉丁社会 亚裔社会的问题 不是白人问题
...the Hispanic community Asian community. Not white problems.

166
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,498
不是因为贫穷?
Aren't those issues that deal more with poverty?

167
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,586
不是 不是环境使然 那是胡扯
No. They're not products of their environments either. That's crap.

168
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,963
少数民族才不管国家怎样
Minorities don't give two shits about this country.

169
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,549
他们是来剥削 而非拥抱
They come here to exploit it not to embrace it.

170
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,969
几百万欧洲白人来此发展繁荣
millions of white European-Americans came here and flourished.

171
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,181
已经一世代了 他们怎么回事?
Within a generation. What the fuck is the matter with these people?

172
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,934
要杀个消防员
They have to go around shooting at firemen.

173
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,478
- 这与你父亲的死有何关连?
- What does this have to do with your father?

174
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,230
- 他是执行公务被杀

175
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,524
去黑人社区灭火...
Putting out a fire in a nigger neighborhood...

176
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,526
...他不去理就好了
...he shouldn't have given a shit about.

177
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,364
杀他的毒贩也许还领失业金呢
He got shot by a fucking drug dealer who probably coliects a welfare check.

178
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,324
- 别说了 - 我很遗憾
- That's enough. - I'm sorry.

179
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,369
德瑞温亚服刑三年多...
Derek Vinyard was released from Chino earlier this morning...

180
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,746
...今早出狱
...after serving three and some-odd years.

181
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,457
我们得持续关心此事
I think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.

182
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,417
万一他出事...
If something happens to him...

183
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,045
...这里会很不平静
...things could get very ugly down by the beach.

184
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,463
低调行事
Just keep it low.

185
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,884
以前维尼斯海滩不是这样
Venice Beach didn't always look like this.

186
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,470
以前环境很棒
lt used to be a great neighborhood.

187
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,472
红砖道虽坑坑巴巴...
The boardwalk's always been a dump...

188
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,516
...但我们搬来这里时...

189
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,185
...维尼斯是很适合居住的地方

190
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,815
几年后 就完了
Over the years though it's just gone to hell.

191
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,067
帮派像瘟疫般
The gangs are like a plague.

192
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,945
他们从英格坞和南中移来...
They moved west from inglewood and South Central...

193
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,530
...占领了这里
...and basically took over.

194
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,991
我没犯规 你脑子有病?
lt ain't fouling you. What's wrong with you?

195
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,495
我操你全家

196
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,582
我没时间管这档子鸟事

臭婊子
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

203
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,781
所以德瑞加入门徒帮
That's why Derek started the D.O.C.

204
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,658
他说白人
He said white kids shouldn't have to

205
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,286
在自己社区不该害怕
walk around scared in their own neighborhood.

206
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,373
他一度真把社区夺回来了
For a while there he really made it like it was ours again.

498
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,032
...防堵这些重罪犯是徒劳的
...it's not worth the effort to screen for convicted felons.

499
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,663
谁在乎? 政府不在乎
Who gives a shit? Our government doesn't give a shit.

There's nothing funny going on here. This is about your life and mine.

507
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,146
勤劳的美国人被耍了...
It's about decent hardworking Americans falling through the cracks...

508
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,857
...因为政府更在乎...

问题尚未解决前 应停止移民!
And I say until you take care of that close the fucking book!

514
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,208

我们失去了自由...

不是遥不可及之地发生的事
This isn't happening in places we can't do anything about it.

520

...and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.

526
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,913
看着这些屁事 都没人管
I see this shit going on and I don't see anybody doing anything about it.

527
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,915
我非常不爽!
And it fucking pisses me off!

528
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,002
你们放眼看看
So look around you.

529
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,256
这已经不是我们的家园 这里已成战场了
This isn't our neighborhood. It's a battlefield.

530
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,384
这里是战场 你有两条路:
We're on a battlefield tonight. Make a decision.

531
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,512
你们就眼睁睁站在一边...
Are we gonna stand on the sidelines...

532
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,473

00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:13,039
你知不知道雇非法移民犯法 亚洲猪?
Don't you know it's against the law to hire border-jumpers you nip bastard?

539
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,002
我操 我操!
Fuck that! Fuck that!

540
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,092
甜心 别害怕 我不会害你
Sweetheart. No you don't need this. We're not gonna hurt you.

541
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,845
求你不要!
Please! Please no!

542
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,140
拉丁贱货!
You fucking spic!

543
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,854
我想这婊子饿了
You know what? I think this bitch is hungry.

544
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,064
她太臭 来些清洁剂
This bitch stinks. Get me cleaning products.

545
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,150
味道像臭鱼烂虾
Smells like fish and chips and guacamole.

546
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,609
给你的
Here we go.

547
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,653
这样就对了
Yeah that's it.

548
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,086
起来!
Get the fuck up!

549
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,967
去死吧!
Get down!

550
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,572
墨西哥万岁

551
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,685
来点豆子吧 豆人
Have some fucking beans you goddamn beaner.

552
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,689
- 抢走老子工作 - 你个贱人!
- Take my job. - You donkey bitch!

553
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,445
那边也来点
Get some of that in there.

554
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,740
- 倒下去 - 颜色很棒
- Throw it on throw it on. - Hey that's a great color on you.

555
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,700
你可以干白人的活了 贱人
You can get a white woman's job bitch.

556
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,578
- 比干这烂差事强 - 就是
- A little better than this one huh? - Yeah.

557
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,790
- 白人 - 你可以升级了
- White. - You can move up in the world huh?

558
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,876
混蛋!
Asshole!

559
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,757
走了 离开这里 全都出去 快!
Let's go. We're out of here. Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now!

560
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,303
好了 大家走!
All right let's go! Let's go!

561
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,723
- 快走 - 快走 快走 快走
- Let's go. - Come on let's go let's go let's go.

562
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,642
快走
Let's go.

563
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,940
没绿卡 别想工作 听懂没?
No green card no fucking work comprendes?

564
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,985
- 快走 快走! - 走 走
- Come on. Come on! - Go go go.

565
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,487
收工了! 快走!
We're fucking done! Come on!

(美国历史X档案) (丹尼・温亚著)

567
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,684
爸死了 事情渐渐平静了
Dad was gone. But things were almost normal again.

568
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,354
德瑞工作不错 妈也好多了
Derek had a good job. Mom was starting to live a little.

569
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,692
大家心情都好 没想到祸事会临头
Everyone was feeling so good that we just didn't see it coming.

570
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,485
我们早该想到的
Maybe we should have.

571
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,197
讽刺的是暴动中被毁的店...
The irony is that most of the stores that were destroyed during the riots...

572
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,950
- ...多是黑人的店 - 笨
- ...were owned by black people. - That's stupid though.

573
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,577
干嘛砸自己社区的店?
Why trash your own neighborhood?

574
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,538
我就说那是毫无理性
Well that's my point. It's an irrational act.

575
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:03,001
那些感觉被社会忽视的人...
It's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected...

576
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,711
...用这方式表达不满
...and turned away by the system.

577
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,672
没错 就像卫兹那次...
Exactly. I mean it's like we had in Watts...

578
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,258
...或68年芝加哥暴动那次...
...or the riots in Chicago in '68...

579
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,885
胡扯 我不同意
I don't buy that for a minute.

580
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,722
什么叫无理性的表达 你是逃避
calling a riot an irrational expression of rage that's such a cop-out.

581
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,349
他们是差劲的机会主义者 一群人...
It's opportunism at its worst. A bunch of people...

582
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,644
...逮到机会就去抢 仅此而已
...grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store. Nothing more.

583
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,813
这些抢自己社区商店的人...
The fact these people ripped off stores...

584
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,649
...让其他人对法律...
...in their own communities reflects that these people...

585
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,610
...完全丧失信心
...have no respect for the law.

586
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:33,156
更别提社区意识或公民义务了
And certainly no concept of community or civic responsibility.

587
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,910
慢着 白人也对会白人施暴
Wait a minute. White people commit crimes against white people too.

588
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,413
但白人不会在全国杀人放火
But they're not offing each other in record numbers all over America.

589
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,415
拜托 看看统计数字
Look at the statistics for christ sakes.

590
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,003
三分之一黑人男性正接受惩治教化
One in every three black males is in some phase of the correctional system.

591
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:51,174
是巧合吗 或是那种族有犯罪天分?
ls that a coincidence or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?

592
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,510
不仅如此 他们还很骄傲
Not only that. They're proud of it.

593
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,721
也许是司法制度有偏见
Maybe it says something about prejudice in the judicial system.

594
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,765
你要谈犯罪率...
If you wanna talk about criminal statistics...

595
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,602
...该看看这社会的不公平
...you might wanna take a look at the social inequallties that produce them.

596
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,771
对 我最恨这个
Yap yap. You know what? That's exactly what I hate.

597
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,790
因为你每次都指鹿为马...
Because you're taking one thing and calling it something else...

598
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,945
...强把他们应负的责任淡化掉
...and alieviating the responsibility that these people have for their own actions.

599
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,613
就好像说:
It's like saying:

600
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,075
"不是暴动 是愤怒 不是犯罪 是贫穷"
"It's not a riot it's rage. It's not crime it's poverty."

601
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:21,371
全是鬼扯 法庭也这样
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit. It's exactly what happened in this trial too.

602
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,958
媒体乱报导 所以大家就只注意那些条子...
Because the media twisted things around so people focused on these cops...

603
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,668
...会不会定罪...
...whether they'd get convicted...

604
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,963
...隆尼金的权利有没被侵害
...and whether Rodney King's civil rights had been violated.

605
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,257
忽略了隆尼本身
Everybody lost sight of Rodney King himself.

606
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,385
他自己承认犯下多起案子
The guy's a multiple felon by his own admission.

607
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,639
他尾巴翘天上 在高速公路开时速120公里
He's high as a goddamn kite driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.

608
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,560
被条子拦下 他攻击他们
He gets pulied over by a bunch of cops and he attacks them.

609
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,312
攻击条子 那是底线 然后他离开了
He attacked police officers. Bottom line. And he walked.

610
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,316
一个痞子经过 正好拍下...
And there's some yahoo with a video camera who turned it on halfway through...

611
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,360
...我们就只看到条子打他
...so all we see is them hitting him.

612
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,573
波威和库恩用警棍打他...
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up and cracking him with billy clubs...

613
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,284
...布里森打他后脑勺
...and Briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull.

614
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,786
大家就说: "好可怜"
And people are going "Oh this poor guy."

615
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,162
他打四个条子
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

616
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,249
条子却要因完全正当的防卫...
And those cops end up on the stand defending themselves...

617
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,794
...上台接受审讯
...for using absolutely standard textbook self-defense procedures.

618
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,021
影带中不是那样
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

619
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,008
你反对? 你成了有关当局啦 妈?
You didn't think so? And what you're an authority Ma?

620
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,343
你说呢 莫瑞?
Murray what do you think?

621
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,932
我觉得警察打得很过分
I did think that the police used their clubs rather excessively.

622
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,436
什么叫过分? 那非常正当
Who are you to say what's excessive? I think it was totally approprlate.

623
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,522
他们的判断力比你强
They're in a better position to make that call than you are.

624
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,614
社会赋予条子
In fact we as society grant cops

625
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:33,860
那种职权...
a certain amount of authority to make those calls...

626
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,780
...因为我们承认他们的工作很危险
...because we acknowledge that their job is difficult and dangerous.

627
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,701
但不幸的是 太少人尊重那种职权
You know? Unfortunately very few people like respect that authority.

628
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,704
你尊重谁啦 三K党
Look who's talking about respect here Mr. Junior-KKK.

629
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,831
- 什么? - 黛薇娜
- What? - Davina.

630
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,876
想念大学就先听好 黛薇娜
You wanna go to coliege Davina? You should learn to listen.

631
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,046
法律是很烂 我承认那是因为条子职权
I didn't say I respected laws. I acknowledge a cop's authority.

632
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,549
但我更恶心让那些让罪犯逍遥在外的法律
I don't respect laws that let monkeys like Rodney King on the street.

633
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,509
第二: 我不是那种...
Second I am not as you well know...

634
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:03,389
...没组织 低级的三K党员
...a member of a low-rent disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

635
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,892
拜托 别胡扯了
Please. So take your head out of your ass.

636
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,603
你根本没重点
You've gotten off the point.

637
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,399
- 我说的是重点 - 是吗? 重点在哪?
- I had a point. That wasn't the point. - Do you have one? What is your point?

638
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,401
你想想看
All right think about this.

639
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,737
那天晚上换做是丹尼在街上...
If Danny had been walking across the street that night...

640
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,691
- ...被隆尼打了...
- ...and Rodney King had plowed into him...

641
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,283
- 别再谈隆尼了
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

642
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,710
谁要吃甜点了?
Who would like some dessert?

643
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,588
我们在讨论
We're having a discussion.

644
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,007
我们在很认真的讨论
We're having a nice discussion right?

645
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,843
若隆尼喝了酒 嗑了药...
If Rodney King had been hopped up on Chivas Regal and PCP...

646
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,096
...杀死丹尼 你看法就会不同
...and kilied Danny you'd sing a different tune.

647
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,807
你我都没看见他打人
I didn't see him hit anybody and neither did you.

648
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,725
正好他没杀人
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

649
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,978
- 谢天谢地 - 小声点 爱莉在睡
- Thank God. - Keep it down okay? Ally's sleeping.

650
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,556
若他杀了人呢?
If he had though?

651
00:44:55,557 --> 00:44:57,777
若那猩猩碾死孩子...
Come on think about it. If that monkey had run some kid over...

652
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,863
...你就会有不同看法了
...everybody would have a different opinion of this matter.

653
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,741
焦点该是隆尼 而不是条子
They'd be focused on Rodney King and not on these officers.

654
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,202
却说他只是攻击警察
But instead he just attacked a few cops.

655
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,248
全国都开始声援这混蛋
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across America for this total son of a bitch.

656
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,624
太奇怪了
I mean it blows my mind.

657
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,793
我们迷信...
We're hung up on this notion we have some...

658
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,546
...该帮助黑人这种论调
...obllgation to help the struggling black man.

659
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,299
让黑人从历史的不公中站起来
Cut him some slack until he can overcome these historical injustices.

660
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,885
你们只会说这套
It's crap. This stuff you guys are saying perpetuates it.

661
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,429
什么自由啦
All this liberal nonsense.

662
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,974
国家已经腐烂了 大家还不知道
Everyone's looking the other way while our country rots from inside out.

663
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,811
林肯130年前解放的黑奴
Christ Lincoln freed the slaves what like 130 years ago?

664
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,564
多少年后却在结帮抢劫?
How long does it take to get your act together?

665
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,650
犹太人五千年前被迫害
Well Jews have been persecuted for over 5000 years.

666
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,571
反对反犹太主义是错的?
Are you saying that it's wrong to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

他可以跟我住
He can move in with me.

775
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,897
我想着 若我没去他房里告诉他...

776
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:16,233
...事情会怎样

00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,281
走吧
Let's go.

804
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:16,394
我没见过死人

805
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:18,300
他脑袋被炸开的声音...

806
00:56:18,405 --> 00:56:21,033
久久挥不去

807
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,669
她不开门?
She ain't gonna open the door?

808
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,422
不知道 有人在那看着我们
I don't know. Someone's there looking at us. Hello?

811
00:56:30,651 --> 00:56:32,846
(判过失杀人)

812
00:56:32,953 --> 00:56:35,183
(去州监狱服刑)

813
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:39,555
(若我去作证 会无期徒刑)

814
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:46,068
开门 丹尼 外面好冷!

820
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,293

821
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,545
快喝 丹尼 免得你哥看见
Drink up Danny before your brother sees you.

822
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,921
干 他来啦?

829
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,501
- 我以为你交了那报告 - 对...
- I thought you turned that paper in. - I did...

830
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,586
...莫瑞去告状...
...and now fucking Murray turned me in...

831
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,964
...西尼要我重写别的
...and so Sweeney's making me write another one.

832
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,719
老西尼真是永不放弃 是吗?
Good old Sweeney. He never stops trying now does he?

833
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,640
他以黑人为傲 我最恨这种人
He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger people. I hate those guys.

834
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,517

Now wait a minute Danny.

835
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,393
他不是骄傲
He's not proud.

836
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:49,233
是自以为很神的汤姆叔叔
He's a manipulative self-righteous Uncle Tom.

837
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,570
想让你觉得写希特勒很罪恶
He's trying to make you feel guilty about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah.

838
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:57,407
有些黑人 拉丁美洲人 写写马丁・路德金...
Some nigger some spic writes about Martin Luther King...

839
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,576

841
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,042
很伪善吧?
I mean you can see the hypocrisy in that can't you?

842
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,878
当然
Definitely.

跟我一起走
Just come with me.

852
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,334
干嘛离开? 他们膜拜你 你是他们的神
Why would you wanna leave? They worship you. You're like a god to them.

853
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,253
以前那算什么 ...
If you think we had it good before...

854
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,214
- ...现在才正点 - 我都不要了
- ...wait till you see what it's like now. - I don't want all that.

855
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:58,010
我不要再牵连家人了 我已经连累家里人够多了
I don't want my family involved. Everything I've done here has fucked it up.

856
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:01,179
- 你懂吗? - 你觉得错了?
- Do you understand? - You think what you did was wrong?

857
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,099
少来
Oh baby. Oh come on.

858
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,643
那些黑鬼罪有应得...
Those niggers got exactly what they deserved...

859
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,770
...大家心知肚明
...and we all know that.

860
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,439
我知道你刚出来...
I understand you just got out...

861
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,191
但没人敢伤你 没人敢动你
...but no one's gonna hurt you. No one can touch you.

862
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,818
外面有一支军队
There's a small army out there.

863
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,321
黑鬼绝别想占便宜
We won't let a bunch of spooks kick us out of here.

864
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,616
你没听懂 我不是怕
Stacey you're not listening to me okay? I'm not scared.

865
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,950
我是不要了
I don't want it anymore.

866
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,454
我不想再搞这事了
I'm done with it. I'm through with this.

867
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,372
全....
It's....

868
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,791
全是狗屎
It's bullshit Stacey.

869
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,420
那不是你要的 相信我
listen you don't need this Stacey. Come on trust me.

870
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,673
想和我在一起 就相信我 跟我走
If you wanna be with me just trust me. Come with me.

871
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,884
好吗
Come on.

872
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,093
你疯了
You're nuts.

873
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,220
你疯了 我不走
You are nuts. No way.

874
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,349
你不知道现在这里的状况
I don't think you realize what's been going on here.

875
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:49,186
我们比以前大十倍 而且有组织
We are 10 times what we were and we are bloody organized.

876
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,563
你绝对想不到!
I mean it is like nothing you have ever seen!

877
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,065
我错了 算了
This is a mistake. Forget it.

878
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,068
等等 什么错了?
Wait a second. Wait a second. What was a mistake?

879
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,320
史黛西 说再见吧
Stacey just say goodbye. Just say goodbye.

880
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,530
这不像你
This isn't you.

881
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,241
- 我了解你 - 你根本不懂我
- I know you. - You don't know anything about me Stacey.

882
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,043
- 你是丹尼他哥? - 是的

Tell him Lizzy's looking for him.

884
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,214
丽丝 请你转告
Lizzy. Thank you.

885
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,929
让黑鬼 拉丁鬼来分嘛
We'll let the niggers kikes and spics grab for their piece of the pie.

886
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,389
难怪他们
Can't blame them.

887
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,893
但他们得赢 才分的到
Of course they're gonna have to fight to get it.

888
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,855
能把他们赶走...
And if we scare the fuck out of people...

889
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,567
...我们若有死伤也值得
...and a few people get kilied in the process so be it.

890
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,238
要写下来 丹
You gonna put that in your paper Danny?

891

894
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,752
- 你知道我会来 - 随他去吧 德瑞
- You knew I was gonna come. - Let the kid alone Derek.

895
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,796
他自己会上床
He knows when to go to bed.

896
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:03,009
- 去外面等 - 拜托 我没干嘛
- Go wait outside. - Come on I'm not doing anything.

897
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,137
有个女孩在外面
There's a little blond sitting out there.

898
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:08,473
说找你 快急死了 去吧
She keeps asking for you. She's dying. Come on.

899
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,851
- 我去看看 - 对她温柔点
- Well I gotta check out. - Go easy on her.

900
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,978

901
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,942
外面等我
Wait for me right outside.

902
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,157
别紧张
Take it easy.

903
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,284
开心点
Chill out.

904

909
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:48,430
- 你觉得怪 很正常 - 我不觉的怪
- It's only natural you should feel funny. - I don't feel funny Cam.

910
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:53,185
你把胖子吓了一跳 胖子觉得你坐牢坐坏了
You know you made the fat kid nervous. He thinks the joint messed with your mind.

911
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,686

917
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,214

Wait till you see what we've done with the lnternet.

918
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:26,051
西雅图到圣地牙哥的帮派 全都集结了
We've got every gang from Seattle to San Diego working together now.

919
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,470
帮派不再竞争 他们团结了
They're not competing. They're consolldated.

920

I am done with it. All that bullshit out there and all your bullshit too.

931

I'm out.

932
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:06,341
我了解你在里面很难受...
I understand how you feel. You've just done some hard time...

933
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,426
别跟我说难受
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.

934
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,720
- 你根本不懂 - 我坐过牢
- You don't know a thing about it. - I done mine.

935

Badass peckerwood with an attitude.

1071
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,223
我告诉你
Well let me tell you something man.

1072
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,100
你最好小心点
You better watch your ass.

1073
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,018
在牢里...
Because in the joint...

1074
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,145
...黑鬼是你 不是我
...you the nigger not me.

1075
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,736
一年后 我觉得很安全了
I was a year in. I thought I was cruising.

1076
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,656
情况却越来越复杂
Then everything started getting complicated.

1077
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,349
我来搞定
I'll take care of that all right?

1078
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,143
那在干嘛?
What the fuck is that?

1079
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,479
搞什么鬼?
What's that all about?

1080
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,858
那是政治 给好处
Oh that's just politics man. Favors you know.

1081
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,112
他给拉丁猪好处?
He's doing favors for that fucking spic?

1082
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:17,201
米奇跟他们私下有点生意
Mitch has got a little something extra on the side with them boys you know.

1083
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,287
你骗我 对吧?
You're kidding right?

1084
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,456
没有
No.

1085
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,501
真是狗屎 该跟他说一下
That's bullshit man. Somebody should say something to him.

1086
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,253
他脑子坏啦?
What the fuck is he thinking?

1087
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,714
你活到今天全靠米奇
Mitch is the only reason why you're not a corpse right now.

1088
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,092
- 别忘了 - 我可不在乎
- Remember that. - You know what? I don't fucking give a shit.

1089
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,387
我能靠自己 他不该做那事
I can take care of myself. He shouldn't be doing that.

1090
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,557
我要吐了 说牢里多恐怖...
I'm getting sick of it. A lot of hard talk around here...

1091
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,976
...根本是鬼扯
...and not a lot of follow-through.

1092
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,230
你最好别太激动...
I think you'd better chill out...

1093
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:50,193
...嘴巴干净点 我受够你那套了
...on the preaching bullshit okay? We're getting a little tired of that shit.

1094
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,738
安分点
Ease up on it.

1095
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,478
你来干嘛 妈?
What are you doing here Doris?

1096
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,271
我在附近
I was in the neighborhood.

1097
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,066
叫你们别来看我
Well look I told you I don't want you all coming here.

1098
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:33,110
我管不了了
I don't care what you told me okay?

1099
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,570
我有事找你
I need to talk to you now.

1100
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:56,717
你们都好吗?
So how is everyone?

1104
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,735
- 丹尼呢? - 丹尼?

丹尼他好崇拜你
He holds you up so high.

1107
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,995
他把你当神
He thinks you're the greatest.

1108
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,957
常在开曼和朋友面前...
He's always bragging about you to Cameron...

1109
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,917
...夸赞你
...and all his new friends.

1110
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,715
他让我想到你
He's starting to remind me of you.

1111
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,551
老天 别那么担心
Jesus don't sound so worried all right?

1112
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,219
他没事的
I'm sure he's fine.

1113
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:44,181
他16岁了 不会永远是个小天使
I mean he's 16 years old Doris. He's not gonna be a little angel forever.

1114
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,019
我看见大儿子毁了一生...
You think because I watched my first-born fuck up his entire life...

1115
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:52,189
...能让小儿子也步他后尘吗?
...that I can sit here and see my baby follow him down the same toliet?

1116
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,984
我在坐牢 能怎办? 别拿这烦我
You know what? I can't fix all this shit from up here okay?

1117
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,527
没要你怎办
I'm not asking you to.

1118
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,864
我待在这够苦 你还过来折磨我
lt makes me feel bad. I'm trying to get through this you make it harder.

1119
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,034
只有你苦吗 德瑞?
You think you're the only one doing time Derek?

1120
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,620
你一个人受苦?
You think you're here all alone?

1121
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,622
你在这里 我会好过?
You think I'm not in here with you?

1122
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,677
操
Fuck man.

1123
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,726
这样搞床单 就以为搞得完?
Every day you go through these sheets like you gonna get to the end of them.

1124
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:32,313
黑鬼 别板个脸
Look nigga will you chill the fuck out?

1125
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,691
妈的! 不管你做多快...
Goddamn! No matter how fast you get through them man...

1126
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,361
...他们还是会不断送来
...they'll keep bringing them in and bringing them in.

1127
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:42,239
用丢的只会害你心脏病
Throwing them around ain't gonna do a thing but give you a heart attack.

1128
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,908
我是无所谓
Know what? That's cool with me.

1129
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,494
但我也快被你吓出心脏病了!
But you're gonna give me a goddamn heart attack too!

1130
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,755
我知道 我是蠢黑鬼
I know I know. I'm just a dumb stupid nigger right?

1131
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,632
我懂个屁?
What do I know?

1132
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:04,303
但我不会拿床单出气
I know I ain't the one getting mad at them damn sheets though.

1133
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:08,891
会让我生气的 是这个:
As a matter of fact the only sheets I get mad at? I'll tell you.

1134
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,604
"各位 这么办
"Boys this is what we gonna do.

1135
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,439
今天我们来恨黑鬼
We gonna hate some niggers.

1136
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:19,443
大家恨黑鬼 恨黑鬼一天
We gonna hate some goddamn niggers. That's all we'll do is hate niggers all day.

1137
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,029
还没想到恨哪个 随便恨
I don't know what a nigger is but we'll hate them.

1138
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,115
我表弟德瑞在牢里...
My cousin Derek is in the pen right now...

1139
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:28,369
...跟一个黑鬼工作 快被搞疯了"
...working next to a nigger driving him nigger crazy."

1140
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:48,889
你看 这才像话
See? That's the ticket.

1141
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,851
好好做
Nice and easy.

1142
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,478
井水不犯河水
Now we can ignore each other in peace.

1143
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,568
我说 "你在干嘛?" 知道他告诉我什么?
I go "What you doing?" Know what he tells me?

1144
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,821
他说: "我想操的那猪更烂"
He goes "It's better than the pig I just tried to fuck."

1145
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,117
都不让我说完
Never lets me finish.

1146
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,995
- 说个笑话吧? - 你也操了他?
- Why don't you tell a joke? - Did you fuck him too?

1147
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:16,959
我回去 她躺着 她喜欢用啤酒瓶搞自己
I get back she's laying on her back. She likes the wine bottle thing right?

1148
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,670
怎么了?
What's up?

1149
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,803
讲重点好吗? 老天
Will you get to the fucking point? Jesus Christ.

1150
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,855
他向墨西哥人买货 卖自己人
He was taking it from the Mexicans and dealing it out to his own people.

1151
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,484
那些人完全没有良知
He didn't believe in shit. None of them did.

1152
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,736
花了太长时间
Took too damn long.

1153
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:53,120
温亚!
Hey. Hey Vinyard!

1154
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,511
干嘛?
What?

1155
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,597
别那样看我
Come on man. Don't look at me like that.

1156
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,141
知道这味道吧?
You know what that smells like right?

1157
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,394
这会让人想起女人
Come on don't tell me this smell doesn't remind you of a woman.

1158
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,356
真想念那味道
God I miss that smell man.

1159
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,819
我在外面的工作也没多好
The job I had on the outside wasn't much better than this one.

1160
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,572
但至少回家都能躺在这味道旁
But at least I gotta go home at night and lie down next to this sweet smell.

1161
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,536
天哪 想死了
God I miss that.

1162
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,205
你有女人吗?
You got a woman?

1163
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,873
你一定有女人
Yeah you got a woman man.

1164
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,709
给你一些忠告
Let me give you some advice. All right?

1165
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:42,920
如果她来看你...
She comes to visit you...

1166
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:47,591
...无论如何 在她离开前千万别吵架
...whatever you do no matter what don't let her leave here in a fight.

1167
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:50,845
别让她走时心情不好...
Don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude. If you do...

1168
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:55,766
...否则你每天都会担心 她会去找别人上床
...you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else.

1169
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,228
所以她来时 跟她说些好听的
She comes to see you it's nothing but sweet talk through that glass.

1170
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,772
让她开心的离开
Send her away floating all right?

1171
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,942
这里不像外面 你可以跟她吵...
Because it's not like the real world. Where you can fight...

1172
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,696
...吵完再来个"补偿性"做爱
...but it's cool to fight because you can make up and have make-up sex.

1173
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,949
你知道的 愤怒做爱 边气边做爱
You know what I'm saying? That angry sex. That sex with an attitude.

1174
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:15,619
你可以背朝天 让她打你 把气发出来
Where you lay on your back and let her take out all that aggression on you.

1175
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:17,705
男人都知道 很刺激的做爱
All guys know that man. That's that good sex.

1176
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,874
叽叽叫
It's that pow pow pow.

1177
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,877
她先在上面处罚你
Let her get on top and she's gonna punish you first right?

1178
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:24,545
"你好坏
"You been a bad boy huh?

1179
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,423
坏孩子 我打你
You been a bad boy and I'm gonna punish you.

1180
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:32,720
我打你屁屁 别再让我看见你...
I'm gonna put it on you. Don't you ever let me catch you...

1181
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,471
...偷看别的女生
...looking at another woman.

1182
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,516
让我爽我就饶了你
Yeah. I may forgive you if you bring it.

1183
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,019
好像快来了 我原谅你
I think I can. I forgive.

1184
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:43,689
我原谅你 就是那里 你戳到了
I forgive. Oh right there. Right there. You hitting it. My spot.

1185
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:47,985
就是那里 爽 爽 我原谅你了
That's it. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I forgive you.

1186
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:51,655
我原谅你了 我原... 我原... 我原谅你了
I forgive you. I for... I for... I forgive you.

1187
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,824
我爱你!"
I love you!"

1188
01:21:57,662 --> 01:21:59,330
动起来
Let's keep it moving.

1189
01:22:11,435 --> 01:22:15,095
湖人队怎会比塞尔提克更强?
How do you figure the Lakers to ever be a bigger dynasty than the Celtics?

1190
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:18,474
- 湖人只是侥幸 - 你疯啦?
- The Lakers are like a flare-up. A fluke. - Are you crazy?

1191
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:21,602
四年一遇的好教练 塞尔提克才是传奇!
One good coach for four years. The Celtics are like a dynasty!

1192
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:26,190
少来 塞尔提克是史上最丑的队
Come on man. The Celtics were like the ugliest team in the history of sports.

1193
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,275
最丑的传奇
A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers man.

1194
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,486
那个凯文麦豪
Look at Kevin McHale.

1195
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,322
詹姆渥西的头像西瓜
James Worthy? The guy has a head like a melon.

1196
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,033
- 女人爱他 - 真没办法跟你说话
- No he had ladies. - I can't even talk to you.

1197
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,869
- 我都不知道你在说什么 - 你头壳坏了
- I don't even know what you're saying. - You are tweaking.

1198
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:41,121
波士顿 塞尔提克
Boston Celtics.

1199
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,623
- 几条了? - 够了
- How many is that? - That's enough.

1200
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,375
够了? 好的
Enough? All right.

1201
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,552
我算糊涂了
I lost count man.

1202
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,554
- 没关系 - 好的
- Doesn't matter man. - All right.

1203
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,556
谁会来算?
Who's counting anyway?

1204
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:08,524
我问你
All right so I wanna know something.

1205
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,568
你怎么进来的?
What the fuck landed you in here?

1206
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,821
没杀人 又没混帮派
You didn't kill. Too skinny for a gangbanger.

1207
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,992
什么话 别光看我瘦 我也有拳头 懂吗?
That a bitch. Don't judge a book by its cover. I can throw these things all right?

1208
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,412
- 你懂吗? - 好啦 到底怎样嘛?
- You know what I'm saying? - Whatever. Come on. What did you do?

1209
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:25,416
不干你事 太丢脸了
Yo man it's none of your business all right? It's embarrassing all right?

1210
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,795
什么? 丢脸...? 谁不丢脸
What? Embar...? Everybody in here is embarrassed.

1211
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,923
进来的人都是没跑掉
You think? Nobody in here got away with anything.

1212
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:34,925
做了什么嘛?
What did you do?

1213
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:39,763
我偷了电视
Look man I stole a TV all right?

1214
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,765
偷电视怎会丢脸?
So you stole a TV. What's embarrassing?

1215
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:46,020
我偷了电视 隔壁是早餐店
I stole a TV from a store that was right next door to a doughnut shop all right?

1216
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:49,106
我跑 老板边追边叫
I run out the store owner's running behind me yelling bam.

1217
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,692
我撞到三个条子
I run into three cops all right?

1218
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,944
看吧 我说了丢脸 你笑我
I told you it was embarrassing and you laugh.

1219
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:56,280
等一下
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1220
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:58,907
那没道理啊
That doesn't make sense.

1221
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,369
偷电视怎会判六年?
No you didn't get six years for stealing a TV.

1222
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,789
- 老实交代 - 我跑进店 跑出来...
- Come on. - I go in the store I come out...

1223
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,293
...条子捉我手 电视砸到他脚
...the police officer grabs my arm TV falls on his foot and breaks it.

1224
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,628
他们说我拿电视砸警察
They said I threw the TV at the officer.

1225
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,756
袭警罪 判了六年
Assault. Six years.

1226
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:15,758
说实话
Come on. Tell the truth.

1227
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:17,801
你是砸他或怎样
You chucked it at him. Or something.

1228
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:20,929
我说了 我从店里跑出来...
like I said I came out of the store...

1229
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:24,641
...他抓我 电视机就掉到他脚上
...he grabbed my arm it fell on his foot.

1230
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:33,442
你很行吗 宝贝? 你很行吗 你很行吗?
What you got for me baby? What you got for me? What you got for me?

1231
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,862
射一个
There you go baby. Yeah baby.

1232
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,989
这才叫帅!
That's what I'm talking about!

1233
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,870
防住他
Put some D on him now.

1234
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,028
操你
Fuck you.

1235
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,030
拿毛巾来! 抓住他
Get a towel! Hold him. Hold him.

1236
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:30,040
- 想当黑鬼 宝贝? - 操你!
- You wanna be a nigger sweet boy? - Fuck you!

1237
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,543
就把你当黑鬼
We're gonna treat you like one.

1238
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,379
加油
Come on.

1239
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,228
操你
Fuck you.

1240
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:58,318
- 搞的真爽 - 操你!
- That was real sweet. - Fuck you!

1241
01:26:09,266 --> 01:26:10,790
(白人强权)

1242
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,937
他怎样?
How is he?

1243
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:36,064
缝了六针
Well he took six stitches.

1244
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,657
嘿 老兄
Hey man.

1245
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,484
你到底是来干嘛?
Oh man what the hell are you doing here anyway?

1246
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:24,321
想谈谈丹尼 待会再说
Well I came to talk about Danny but we don't have to do that right now.

1247
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,739
给你几本书
I brought you some books.

1248
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:31,328
他怎么了? 别吊我胃口
Well what about him? You know? Don't keep me in suspense.

1249
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,997
他正在步你后尘
He's headed right where you are.

1250
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:39,086
我妈已经来探望过我了
Oh man you know what? My mother already laid this trip on me man.

1251
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,380
丹尼不是我责任
Danny's not my responsibility. You know?

1252
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:45,050
我能怎么办? 想也没用 要我自责吗?
What do you expect me to do? lt doesn't help. Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1253
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:49,513
没要你干嘛 我只想知道你的感觉
I don't want you to do anything. I need to know the truth about how you feel.

1254
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,891
我会希望他进来吗? 我的意思是....
Well what? You think I want him in here? I mean....

1255
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:56,311
我不知道我什么感觉...
I don't know. I don't know what I feel. I'm all....

1256
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,856
我觉得很迷惑
I feel a little inside out.

1257
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,694
我不知道 有些事...
Um you know I don't know. There's some things...

1258
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,029
...跟我想的不一样
...that don't fit.

1259
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:07,990
常有的事
Well that happens.

1260
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,868
你这么聪明 不该沦落至此...
Look you are too damn smart to be floating around here...

1261
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:14,621
...不会看不清那种假象
...pretending you don't see the holes in this bullshit.

1262
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:17,791
我是迷惑 但没说不相信
listen I said I was confused. I didn't say I didn't believe in it.

1263
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,335
你得敞开心胸
All right. That's why you have to stay open.

1264
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,046
愤怒在征服你
Right now your anger is consuming you.

1265
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:26,216
愤怒把你脑袋冲昏了
Your anger is shutting down the brain God gave you.

1266
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:29,886
从高中你就一直谈我的内心
You've been talking about what's going on in me since I was in high school.

1267
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:33,056
你怎会知道我心里想什么?
How the fuck do you know so much about what's going on inside me?

1268
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:35,350
我了解我自己
No I know about me.

1269
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:39,730
了解这里 了解你待在什么地方
I know about this place. I know about the place you are in.

1270
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,399
你知道这里什么?
What do you know about the place I'm in?

1271
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,443
有一阵子...
There was a moment...

1272
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:47,446
...我怪罪一切 怪每个人...
...when I used to blame everything and everyone...

1273
01:28:47,613 --> 01:28:51,700
...让我和我的同胞...
...for all the pain and suffering and vile things that happened to me...

1274
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,244
...受尽痛苦折磨
...that I saw happen to my people.

1275
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:57,122
我怪每个人 怪白人
I used to blame everybody. Blame white people.

1276
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,875
怪社会 怪上帝
Blame society. Blame God.

1277
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:03,920
他不回答 是因为我问的不对
I didn't get no answers because I was asking the wrong questions.

1278
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:06,757
- 你要问对问题 - 例如什么?
- You have to ask the right questions. - like what?

1279
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:12,095
你曾努力让你人生更好吗?
Has anything you've done made your life better?

1280
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:24,441
没有
No.

1281
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:34,034
你要帮我
You gotta help me now.

1282
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:38,955
帮帮我
Just help me.

1283
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:42,459
把我弄出去
Get me out of here you know?

1284
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:48,215
我还剩四个月就面试
I'm up in four months for review.

1285
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,551
帮我说说好话
Put in a word for me.

1286
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:54,137
我已经说了好话 那你出去后呢?
I already have. So you're out there then what?

1287
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:56,973
我不要让家人再担心
I don't wanna fuck up my family anymore.

1288
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:59,309
我要离的远远的
I'll go as far away as I can get.

1289
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:01,103
那还不够
That's not good enough.

1290
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:07,109
要我帮你 就得更努力 我是有条件的
You want my help you gotta do better than that. My help is not unconditional.

1291
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:11,071
逃避不是好办法
But running just ain't good enough.

1292
01:30:44,021 --> 01:30:45,313
操他
Fuck him.

1293
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:48,150
操他 让他去当黑鬼啊
Fuck him. Fuck him. Let the niggers have him.

1294
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,695
怎样 德?
Yo what's up D?

1295
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:54,906
你在餐厅做了什么事?
Yo what's all that bullshit you pulied in the mess hall man?

1296
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:58,285
你头壳坏啦 疯啦?
Are you out of your fucking mind? Are you fucking crazy?

1297
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:01,621
德 看着我!
D! Look at me man!

1298
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,206
你不能一个人扛着
You can't make it on your own.

1299
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:07,335
我不怕那些婊子 那次六个人攻我
I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies. There was six of them they jumped me.

1300
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:09,963
没下次了 他们敢来就再来
That won't happen again. I hope they fucking try.

1301
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,674
我不是说你的白人朋友!
Look I'm not talking about your peckerwood friends!

1302
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,051
他们保护你!
They were protecting your stupid ass!

1303
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:17,053
你还公然挑衅
You dissed them in public.

1304
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:19,264
现在没人靠了!
Now you're on your fucking own!

1305
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,641
小心我那帮兄弟
Yo man I'm talking about the brothers.

1306
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:25,479
他们会操你 扁你 宰了你!
They're gonna fuck you toss your salad then smoke your motherfucking ass!

1307
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:29,566
说点我不知道的吧 你以为我没想过?
Tell me something I don't already know. You think I haven't thought about that?

1308
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:32,861
要来就让他们来 我无能为力
They're gonna come for me they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.

1309
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:37,282
我能怎样?
What can I do man?

1310
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,747
我又回到以前
So I was right back where I started.

1311
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,665
每天都想: 他们要来了
Every day I was sure it was my day.

1312
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:49,961
每当我走出牢房时
Every time I stepped out of my cell.

1313
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,589
每当我进那浴室时
Every time I got in that shower.

1314
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,554
我想他们有所行动是迟早的事
I figured it was only a matter of time before they made a move.

1315
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,642
我只希望快点来临
I just hoped that it'd be quick.

1316
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:37,342
但他们没有再来
But it never came.

1317
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:41,888
我猜不透 我知道有人很想扁我
I couldn't figure it out. I knew some of them were itching for it.

1318
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:44,474
之后 我就独来独往...
But after a while I just put my head down...

1319
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:47,978
...埋头去读西尼给我的那些书
...read the stuff that Sweeney sent me and I kept to myself.

1320
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,275
最后那六个月 我像个鬼魂
The last six months in that place I was like a ghost.

1321
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,583
怎样? 要出去啦?
What's up man? You getting out?

1322
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:15,672
还等什么? 快滚啊
What the fuck you waiting on? Get the fuck on out of here.

1323
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:21,469
- 我有个奇怪感觉 - 什么?
- Yeah you know I got this funny feeling. - Oh yeah? What's that?

1324
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:27,767
我觉得我能平安离开是因为你
I'm thinking maybe the only reason I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.

1325
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,978
少来 快滚吧 你!
Come on man. Get the fuck out of here man!

1326
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:33,607
我会为白鸡拼自己老命?
You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line for a crazy-ass peckerwood?

1327
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:37,694
对 我是白痴
Yeah. Right. Stupid.

1328
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,368
我是这么猜想
That's what I thought.

1329
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:51,541
我欠你
I owe you man.

1330
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:54,711
你欠我个屁
Man you don't owe me shit all right?

1331
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,923
我欠你
Yes I do.

1332
01:34:08,851 --> 01:34:10,185
你也快走了
You'll be out in no time.

1333
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,479
放心 小意思
Come on man. It's a piece of cake. All right?

1334
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,692
小心那些兄弟 小心点!
You just take it easy on the brothers all right? The brothers!

1335
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:30,246
天哪
God man.

1336
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:34,417
我很难过 德
I'm sorry Der.

1337
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,212
你的那些事
Sorry that happened to you.

1338
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:41,383
我不难过 我很幸运
No I'm not. I'm lucky.

1339
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,134
因为我知道...
I feel lucky because...

1340
01:34:43,302 --> 01:34:45,220
...那些是错的 丹
...it's wrong Dan.

1341
01:34:46,972 --> 01:34:50,934
它啃噬了我 几乎害我送命
It's wrong and it was eating me up. It was gonna kill me.

1342
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,812
我不断问自己...
And I kept asking myself all the time...

1343
01:34:53,979 --> 01:34:56,940
...当初怎会相信那些的?
...how did I buy into this shit you know?

1344
01:34:58,609 --> 01:35:00,860
是因为气愤
And it's just because I was pissed off.

1345
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:05,156
我做的一切都没赶走愤恨
And nothing I ever did ever took that feeling away.

1346
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,952
丹尼 我杀了两个人哪
I mean I killed two guys Danny. I killed them.

1347
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:13,707
但还是没觉得平静
And that didn't make me feel any different.

1348
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:18,086
只是更迷失 我觉得好腻
lt just got me more lost. And I'm tired of feeling pissed off Danny.

1349
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:20,630
让我好厌倦
I'm just tired of it.

1350
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,134
我不是要你做什么
And I'm not telling you what to do.

1351
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:26,636
真的不是
I'm really not.

1352
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,639
但我需要你了解
But I need you to understand.

1353
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:33,977
因为我爱你 你是我最好的朋友
Because I love you and you're my best friend.

1354
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:38,565
你了解吗?
Do you understand?

1355
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,692
我了解
Yeah I understand.

1356
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:45,822
好了
All right.

1357
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:51,202
天哪
Jesus.

1358
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:10,930
- 没事吧? - 都很好
- Everything okay? - No everything's great.

1359
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,683
你想睡我们的房里吗?
Great. Yeah. You wanna sleep in our room?

1360
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:17,145
- 不了 谢谢 这里很好 - 真的?
- No thank you. Yeah. This is good. I'm fine. - You sure?

1361
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,481
谢谢你
Thank you though.

1362
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,941
我们走吧
All right. Come on let's go.

1363
01:36:42,838 --> 01:36:44,380
晚安
Good night.

1364
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,199
我去洗个澡
I'm gonna take a shower all right?

1365
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:31,321
去回想你亲人的那些事 真的很痛苦
It's hard to look back and see the truth about people you love.

1366
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:35,658
若问德瑞那些事是始于何时...
I think if you asked Derek why it all went the way it did and where it all started...

1367
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:38,494
...他可能会说 是爸被谋杀后
...he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.

1368
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:41,956
但其实是更早以前
But the truth is it started earlier.

1369
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:45,251
晚上一起去看球赛吗?
All right. Are we all meeting together for the game tonight?

1370
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,753
当然
Yes definitely.

1371
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,547
地点在本伯格 七点集合 看帅哥打球
Ben's Burgers 7:00 then we go watch the big guy play.

1372
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:51,925
好的
Okay. Yeah.

1373
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:55,511
- 心里有准备吧? - 一直都有
- Psyching up for the game? - Yeah I'm always ready for that.

1374
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,682
要考英文 有点紧张 我还没准备好
I got an English exam third period. I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.

1375
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,477
怎么 怕考个B?
What's the matter afraid you're gonna get a B?

1376
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:04,479
B减也无所谓
Might do you good. B minus.

1377
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,357
别笑我 他真的不一样
Don't laugh. This guy is different.

1378
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:11,986
西尼博士太神了 我没碰过这种老师
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable. I've never had a teacher like this.

1379
01:39:12,154 --> 01:39:14,948
是双学位博士 竟然来教我们
He's got two Ph.D.s. I don't know what he's doing at our school.

1380
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:18,201
- 他跟其他老师不同 - 叫你念什么?
- He's not like other teachers. - What's he got you reading?

1381
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,871
我们要考"土著"这本书
We got this essay exam on this book Native Son.

1382
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:24,540
- 以它出题 - "土著" 我没听过
- All on this one book. - Native Son. I don't know that.

1383
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,959
真是大新闻
That's a big surprise.

1384
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:29,796
我有念书啊
What? I read.

1385
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:33,049
老公 学校不教历险小说
Honey they don't teach Tom Clancy at school.

1386
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,719
学校不教那个
Well they don't.

1387
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:39,263
"土著"写些什么?
So what is it? What is this Native Son? What is it?

1388
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:41,557
写一个黑人的事
It's this book about this black guy.

1389
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:44,560
我们在上黑人文学专辑
We're doing this whole black literature unit.

1390
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:47,021
黑人历史月啊?
What is it Black History Month?

1391
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:48,606
不是...
No it's just like...

1392
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:51,401
西尼决定的 让我们学这个
This guy Sweeney you know it's part of the course now.

1393
01:39:58,409 --> 01:39:59,659
怎样?
What?

1394
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:02,495
没有 只是...
Nothing. It's just you know.

1395
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,539
现在到处都是了
It's everywhere I look now.

1396
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:06,916
什么?
What?

1397
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,878
都在搞"黑人认同运动"
This affirmative blaction.

1398
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:15,842
几本书搞不了什么运动
Honey a few new books doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.

1399
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,761
念归念 考归考
Read the book ace the guy's test.

1400
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:21,264
他说的别全都当真
Just don't swallow everything he feeds you whole.

1401
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,933
- 像新闻说的... - 什么?
- Just because you see it on the news. - But like what?

1402
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:27,437
什么一切平等 哪那么简单
All this stuff about making everything equal. It's not that simple.

1403
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:29,313
你现在念这本"土著"
Now you got this book Native Son.

1404
01:40:29,481 --> 01:40:31,607
这门课其他的书呢?
What happened to the other books in the course?

1405
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:35,820
双学位博士说其他书不好 就不必读了?
They're not any good anymore because Mr. Two-Ph.D.s says they aren't?

1406
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,949
念黑人书 不念好书 合理吗?
Are you gonna trade in great books for black books? Does that make sense?

1407
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:43,202
你得想想这个
You gotta question these things Derek.

1408
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,371
你要看清真相
You gotta look at the whole picture.

1409
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,624
不只这个 我的工作也是
We're talking about books here. But I'm also talking about my job.

1410
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:52,336
我队上来两个黑人...
I got two black guys on my squad now who got their job...

1411
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:56,132
...成绩较好的白人被挤掉了
...over a couple of white guys who actually scored higher on the test.

1412
01:40:57,426 --> 01:41:01,137
这合理吗? 是 一切都得平等...
That make sense? Huh? Yeah sure everything's equal now...

1413
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:05,558
...但我出勤时 这两个比白人差的人...
...but I got two guys watching my back responsible for my life...

1414
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:09,395
...要护卫我安全 因是黑人就得做这工作
...who aren't as good as two others. They got the job because they were black.

1415
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:12,356
- 不是能力强 - 好烂
- Not because they were the best. - That sucks.

1416
01:41:12,524 --> 01:41:14,442
美国就是这样吗?
Yeah. Is that what America is about?

1417
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,736
不 美国是"精英职场"
No. America's about "best man for the job."

1418
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:18,988
你能力强 才能有工作
You do your best you get the job.

1419
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:22,450
这种鬼扯蛋的认同运动...
You know this affirmative action crap...

1420
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,869
我不知道后面...
I don't know what that's about. There's some...

1421
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,663
...是不是有什么阴谋
...hidden agenda or something going on.

1422
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:29,916
- 你懂吗? - 我懂
- You see what I'm saying? - Yeah I do.

1423
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,502
我没那么想过
I don't know I didn't think about it like that.

1424
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:35,046
- 好的... - 但这个人...
- Well... - This guy though...

1425
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:38,132
西尼真得很有说服力...
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney he comes on like so strong...

1426
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,510
...很难不听他说
...it's kind of hard not to listen to him.

1427
01:41:40,677 --> 01:41:42,637
也许他的话...
Maybe some of what he says is kind of...

1428
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:44,430
都是放屁
It's bullshit.

1429
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:46,849
对 也许
Yeah. Yeah maybe.

1430
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:48,601
不
No no.

1431
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,270
是放黑屁
It's nigger bullshit.

1432
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,691
- 你懂了吧? - 我懂
- You see that don't you? - Yeah.

1433
01:41:56,527 --> 01:42:00,530
- 你要小心 - 我懂 我会小心
- You gotta watch out for that. - Yeah I get what you're saying. I will.

1434
01:42:02,407 --> 01:42:03,866
好孩子
Good boy.

1435
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:08,329
- 我以你为荣 - 放心
- I'm proud of you. - Don't worry about it. I got it.

1436
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:13,496
快凌晨5:40了...
It's 5:40 a.m...

1437
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:18,084
...马上我要去看日出
...and in about one minute I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1438
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:20,628
我忘了有没有看过日出
I don't know if I've ever done that.

1439
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:25,174
我们得打起精神 重新开始
Anyway we're gonna try to pick things up and start over.

1440
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:28,302
不是很容易 但我们又团聚了
lt won't be easy but we're all together again.

1441
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:31,264
我感觉很好
And I feel good.

1442
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,809
不知这报告你是否满意
I'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted.

1443
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:38,771
有无提及你要的社会意义
If I hit the social significance or whatever you're looking for.

1444
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:43,234
若还有一点价值 得谢谢你
But for what it's worth thanks a lot.

1445
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,959
气色真好
Wow. You look great.

1446
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:01,961
你看你
Look at you.

1447
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:05,715
见假释官得打扮一下
Yeah. Gotta dress up for the parole officer.

1448
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:07,633
是个俏妞?
ls she cute?

1449
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,386
是个胖男人
She is a fat guy named Hector.

1450
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,513
没法侥幸了
So I'm out of luck.

1451
01:45:15,517 --> 01:45:18,644
跟他报到后 去找工作
I just gotta check in then I'll see about getting my old job back.

1452
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,563
好啊
Great.

1453
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:22,732
早安 小宝贝
Good morning. Yes my love.

1454
01:45:22,899 --> 01:45:26,777
- 黛薇娜 你能...? - 你姐姐会帮你弄
- Davina can you...? - Your sister's gonna help you honey.

1455
01:45:26,945 --> 01:45:28,863
好帅 迷死他们
You look great. Knock them dead.

1456
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:30,323
谢了
Thanks.

1457
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:34,869
- 你想要穿什么? - 我今天想穿蓝裙子
- What would you like to wear? - I wanna wear my blue dress today.

1458
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:38,164
- 真好看 - 是吗? 我觉得很蠢
- You do look good. - Yeah? I feel silly.

1459
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,416
- 真得很好 - 是吗?
- You look good. - Yeah?

1460
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:44,337
心情好吗?
You feel good?

1461
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:50,176
还好...
Yeah. Yeah. I feel you know...

1462
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,428
...心情有点...
...a little...

1463
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:54,430
我会好的 会的
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1464
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:59,393
我不知道...
listen I don't know...

1465
01:45:59,561 --> 01:46:02,396
我不知道能不能让我留在家里
I don't know if it's okay that I'm here.

1466
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:08,402
我想留下
I wanna be here.

1467
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:27,755
- 我去买份报纸 - 好的
- I'm gonna get a paper. - Cool.

1468
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:48,025
- 要什么? - 蜜饼和牛奶
- What do you want? - A maple bar and a large milk.

1469
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:49,860
知道了
All right I got it.

1470
01:46:54,866 --> 01:46:58,536
一杯咖啡 蜜饼和牛奶
Let me get a coffee a maple bar and a large milk to go.

1471
01:46:58,703 --> 01:47:00,162
马上就来
Right away.

1472
01:47:08,296 --> 01:47:10,131
- 德瑞 - 嗨
- Hey Derek. - Hey.

1473
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:12,341
德瑞
Derek.

1474
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:15,010
- 有事找你 - 怎么了?
- We need to talk. - What's going on?

1475
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:19,056
开曼和塞斯在圣约翰医院的加护病房
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan are at the lCU at St. John's.

1476
01:47:19,224 --> 01:47:21,475
- 他们昨晚被砍了 - 严重吗?
- They were jumped last night. - How bad?

1477
01:47:21,643 --> 01:47:23,894
大概死不了
Well it looks like they're gonna live.

1478
01:47:24,062 --> 01:47:27,148
- 算他走运 - 但有人会抓狂
- Then they got lucky. - Somebody's gotta lose though.

1479
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,069
什么?
Aw what?

1480
01:47:32,237 --> 01:47:35,364
希望你去跟那帮人说说
We were kind of hoping that maybe you'd talk to your old crew.

1481
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:37,700
- 不行 - 暴力不好
- Come on. No way. - This is not a good thing.

1482
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,035
他们只可能听你的
If there's anybody they'll listen to it's you.

1483
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:42,455
不行 不瞒你说 我已经不玩了
No. No I hate to tell you but I'm out.

1484
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:44,665
可能他们倒想砍我
Those guys are probably gunning for me now.

1485
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:46,709
我们是请你帮忙
We're asking for your help here Derek.

1486
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,336
- 你跟他建议的? - 德瑞
- Did you tell him I was gonna do this? - Derek.

1487
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,219
那跟我没关系了
This has got nothing to do with me.

1488
01:47:57,387 --> 01:48:00,181
不 有关系 所有一切全都跟你有关系
Yes it does. It has everything to do with you.

1489
01:48:00,348 --> 01:48:03,058
你在干嘛? 我尽力了
What are you doing to me? You know I'm doing my best.

1490
01:48:03,226 --> 01:48:05,728
我现在好好作人 不想连累家里人
I'm going like this to keep my family in the clear.

1491
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:08,355
- 别叫我去解决 - 我没有
- Don't ask me to fix this. - I'm not asking that.

1492
01:48:08,523 --> 01:48:12,443
- 问题早就在了 - 你也有份 现在想逃避?
- lt was there before me. - You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1493
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:14,862
你若逃避 就永远不会平静
You take a break you'll find no peace.

1494
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:17,406
想要平静只有去阻止
The way to find peace is to stick.

1495
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:20,576
不会有用的
It's not gonna make a fucking bit of difference.

1496
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,286
不一定
lt might.

1497
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:26,081
你知道这是什么要求吗? 你真的知道?
Do you know what you're asking me to do? Do you really know?

1498
01:48:26,249 --> 01:48:29,335
我要你想方设法用你的影响力去阻止
Yes. I'm asking you to do whatever is in your power to do.

1499
01:48:32,422 --> 01:48:33,756
天啊
Man.

1500
01:48:35,717 --> 01:48:37,218
操
Fuck.

1501
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,766
好吧
All right.

1502
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:47,895
我会被白人枪杀
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1503
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,773
- 我想不会 - 好的...
- I doubt it. - Yeah well...

1504
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:54,318
...那就够讽刺了
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that let me tell you.

1505
01:48:54,486 --> 01:48:57,738
我带他去上学 半小时后回来
I'm gonna take him to school. I'll be back in half an hour.

1506
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,281
过来
Come on.

1507
01:48:59,449 --> 01:49:02,743
嗨 东西写了吗?
Hey you. You got something good for me this morning?

1508
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:06,455
- 会给你的 西尼博士 好吗? - 好的
- I'll give it to you Dr. Sweeney. All right? - Yeah okay.

1509
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,294
怎么了?
What's going on?

1510
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:19,260
快走
Come on.

1511
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:38,153
我为塞斯好难过
This is so bad for Seth man.

1512
01:49:38,321 --> 01:49:41,490
- 不知他们的伤重不重 - 不知道
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up. - I don't know.

1513
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:44,660
还好没死 但我也不在乎
I'm glad they're not dead but other than that I don't care.

1514
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:46,787
要去看他吗?
Should we visit them?

1515
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:49,081
去看他们? 绝对不要
Visit them? No. No definitely not.

1516
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,584
千万别管这档子事
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1517
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:53,544
你听好...
listen too...

1518
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:57,756
...昨天我离开塞斯那里时 看见有辆车徘徊
...I saw a car cruising by the house last night when I pulled out of there with Seth.

1519
01:49:57,924 --> 01:50:00,718
你回到家后 四周看看
If you get home before me look around the street all right?

1520
01:50:00,885 --> 01:50:02,845
确保一切没事
Make sure there's nothing going on.

1521
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:06,140
天 真惨
Oh man. This is bad.

1522
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,437
- 他们在找你 - 会没事的
- They're after you man. - It'll cool off.

1523
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,272
牢房都待过...
If I made it through Chino...

1524
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:17,026
...这小意思
...this should be a piece of cake right?

1525
01:50:17,193 --> 01:50:20,362
- 你会好好的? - 会
- Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah yeah.

1526
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:23,198
好的
Okay.

1527
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:25,242
你要怎办?
What are you gonna do?

1528
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,161
不知道 会有办法的
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

1529
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:29,455
精神点 不会有事的
Keep your head up. Things are gonna be fine.

1530
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,457
不会有事
It's gonna be fine.

1531
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,334
把报告交了
Go turn that paper in.

1532
01:50:35,545 --> 01:50:38,213
- 好 再见 - 嘿 丹
- Okay. All right see you. - Hey hey Dan.

1533
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:47,681
家里见
I'll see you at home.

1534
01:50:49,601 --> 01:50:51,185
行吗?
All right?

1535
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:52,811
好 再见
Yeah I'll see you.

1536
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:55,147
- 祝你好运 - 好的
- Hey good luck all right? - Yeah.

1537
01:50:55,523 --> 01:50:57,066
再见
See you later.

1538
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,948
- 快迟到了 - 快点走
- We're gonna be late. - We'd better go.

1539
01:51:05,116 --> 01:51:07,701
- 好的 - 快走
- Okay. - All right. Come on.

1540
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:33,686
- 好的 - 待会去找你
- Fine. - All right. I'll catch up with you all right?

1541
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,479
待会见
See you later.

1542
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:57,478
- 德瑞 不要! - 走开!
- Derek no! - Get out of my way!

1543
01:52:57,645 --> 01:52:59,730
- 冷静 冷静 - 走开!
- All right. All right. - Get out of my way!

1544
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:01,315
让他去!
Let him go!

1545
01:53:02,984 --> 01:53:07,029
噢 不 不 不!
Oh no. No! No! No!

1546
01:53:07,363 --> 01:53:09,531
老天啊
Oh Jesus.

1547
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,036
不
No.

1548
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:18,373
噢 不 不 不
Oh no no. No.

1549
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,640
天啊
Oh Jesus.

1550
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,975
老天啊 我做了什么?
God what did I do?

1551
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:54,827
天啊
Oh God.

1552
01:54:05,755 --> 01:54:08,382
我想这就是我学到的
So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned.

1553
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:10,926
我的结论
My conclusion right?

1554
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:13,846
结论就是...
Well my conclusion is...

1555
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:16,014
...憎恨是包袱
...hate is baggage.

1556
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:19,560
生命太短暂 不该老发脾气
life's too short to be pissed off all the time.

1557
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:21,979
根本不值得
It's just not worth it.

1558
01:54:24,774 --> 01:54:27,901
德瑞说文章结尾要用名言
Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.

1559
01:54:28,403 --> 01:54:30,445
他说 最棒的话已有人说了...
He says someone else has already said it best...

1560
01:54:30,613 --> 01:54:35,117
...你超越不了他 就偷他的 来壮大自己
...so if you can't top it steal from them and go out strong.

1561
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:37,953
所以我选了这段:
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1562
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,916
"我们不是敌人 而是朋友
"We are not enemies but friends.

1563
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:45,502
不要当敌人
We must not be enemies.

1564
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,880
尽管会一时冲动...
Though passion may have strained...

1565
01:54:48,047 --> 01:54:51,300
...但切勿伤害我们的友爱
...it must not break our bonds of affection.

1566
01:54:51,467 --> 01:54:56,305
再相逢时 美好回忆会再度浮现...
The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched...

1567
01:54:56,472 --> 01:55:01,101
...让他们以更好的角度 看待人类的本质"
...as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature."
