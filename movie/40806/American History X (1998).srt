...on services for people who had
no right to be here in the first place.

Three billion dollars.

I don't buy that for a minute.

Calling a riot an irrational expression
of rage, that's such a cop-out.

589
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,749
It's opportunism at its worst.
A bunch of people...

...grabbing any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store.

591
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,213
The fact these people ripped off stores...

592
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,049
...in their own communities
reflects that these people...

593
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,010
...have no respect for the law.

594
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:32,556
And certainly no concept of community
or civic responsibility.

One in every three black males is in
some phase of the correctional system.

599
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:50,574
Is that a coincidence or do these people
have a racial commitment to crime?

600
00:41:51,284 --> 00:41:52,910
Not only that. They're proud of it.

Yap, yap. You know what?
That's exactly what I hate.

You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

...and alleviating the responsibility that
these people have for their own actions.

It's not crime, it's poverty."

00:42:16,643 --> 00:42:20,771
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit.
It's exactly what happened in this trial too.

610
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:24,358
Because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops...

611
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,068
...whether they'd get convicted...

612
00:42:26,235 --> 00:42:29,363
...and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

613
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,657
Everybody lost sight
of Rodney King himself.

614
00:42:31,824 --> 00:42:34,785
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

615
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:39,039
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
120 miles an hour down the highway.

616
00:42:39,207 --> 00:42:42,960
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops,
and he attacks them.

617
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,712
He attacked police officers.
Bottom line. And he walked.

618
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,716
And there's some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through...

619
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:51,760
...so all we see is them hitting him.

620
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:55,973
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs...

621
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,684
...and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull.

622
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:01,186
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

623
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:02,562
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

624
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,649
And those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves...

625
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:09,194
...for using absolutely standard,
textbook self-defense procedures.

626
00:43:09,362 --> 00:43:11,321
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

627
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,408
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?

628
00:43:15,451 --> 00:43:16,743
Murray, what do you think?

629
00:43:18,371 --> 00:43:22,332
I did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

630
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,836
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.

631
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,922
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

632
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:33,260
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those calls...

633
00:43:33,428 --> 00:43:37,180
...because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous.

634
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:41,101
You know? Unfortunately,
very few people, like, respect that authority.

635
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:44,104
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.

636
00:43:44,272 --> 00:43:46,231
- What?
- Davina.

637
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:49,276
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You should learn to listen.

638
00:43:49,444 --> 00:43:52,446
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

639
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:55,949
I don't respect laws that let monkeys
like Rodney King on the street.

640
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:57,909
Second, I am not, as you well know...

641
00:43:58,077 --> 00:44:02,789
...a member of a low-rent, disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

642
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,292
Please. So take your head
out of your ass.

643
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,003
You've gotten off the point.

644
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:12,799
- I had a point. That wasn't the point.
- Do you have one? What is your point?

645
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:14,801
All right, think about this.

646
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:17,137
If Danny had been
walking across the street...

647
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:21,683
...and Rodney King had plowed into him...
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

648
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:23,310
Mm-hm.

649
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:32,110
Who would like some dessert?

650
00:44:33,696 --> 00:44:34,988
We're having a discussion.

651
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:37,407
We're having a nice discussion, right?

652
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:40,243
If Rodney King had been hopped up
on Chivas Regal and PCP...

653
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,496
...and killed Danny,
you'd sing a different tune.

654
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:45,207
I didn't see him hit anybody
and neither did you.

655
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:47,125
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

656
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:50,378
- Thank God.
- Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping.

657
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:57,177
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over...

658
00:44:57,345 --> 00:45:00,263
...everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter.

659
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,141
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

660
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,602
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.

661
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,648
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.

662
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:11,024
I mean, it blows my mind.

663
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:13,193
We're hung up on this notion
we have some...

664
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:15,946
...obligation to help
the struggling black man.

665
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:19,699
Cut him some slack until he can overcome
these historical injustices.

666
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:22,285
It's crap. This stuff you guys
are saying perpetuates it.

667
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,829
All this liberal nonsense.

668
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:27,374
Everyone's looking the other way
while our country rots from inside out.

669
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:31,211
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves,
what, like, 130 years ago?

670
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:33,964
How long does it take
to get your act together?

671
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:37,050
Well, Jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years.

672
00:45:37,218 --> 00:45:40,971
Are you saying that it's wrong
to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

673
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,392
STACEY: Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you all the way, baby.

674
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,396
- I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
- Here we go again. I love this part.

675
00:45:49,564 --> 00:45:52,482
Well, look at the way that they
scapegoated Chief Gates.

676
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,152
They'd come down that hard
on black Willie Williams?

677
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,697
- No way. The video was a setup.
- Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?

678
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:01,241
- Yes.
- No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.

679
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:04,244
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.

680
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:05,912
The hell do you think you are?

681
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,999
- She's in the middle of a point.
- Who do you think you are?

682
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,292
- Sit down!
- No. Fuck you!

683
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:12,711
DEREK: Sit down! Shut up!
MURRAY: Derek, calm down.

684
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:14,212
- Sit down!
- Derek, calm down.

685
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,756
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

686
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:18,758
- Sit your ass down! No.
- Fuck you, move!

687
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:21,178
- Sit down, shut up!
- Get out of my way! Move!

688
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,554
Goddamn it, Derek, move!

689
00:46:22,722 --> 00:46:24,848
Shut your mouth
and give my girlfriend respect.

690
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:27,267
Derek, what are you trying to prove?

691
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:31,104
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

692
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:35,150
- Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
DEREK: Come here!

693
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:37,569
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina.

694
00:46:37,737 --> 00:46:40,614
- Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Derek!

695
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:42,282
Stop!

696
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,492
She can't breathe!

697
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:46,745
DORIS:
Let her go!

698
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:48,663
Are you gonna apologize?

699
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,999
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?

700
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:52,417
You're a fucking asshole.

701
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:55,128
I hate you!

702
00:47:03,846 --> 00:47:05,972
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.

703
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,643
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you...

704
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,230
...anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.

705
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,649
- That has nothing to do with it!
DEREK: It doesn't?

706
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:17,400
You don't think I see
what you're doing?

707
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:21,154
You think I'll sit here and smile while
some kike tries to fuck my mother?

708
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:23,198
It's never gonna happen!

709
00:47:23,366 --> 00:47:26,368
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.

710
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:29,663
I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off
and stick it up your ass...

711
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,165
...before I let that happen.
Coming in here...

712
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:37,170
...and poisoning my family's dinner with
your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!

713
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,677
Fuck you!

714
00:47:43,844 --> 00:47:45,637
Yeah, walk out.

715
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:47,931
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading
motherfucker!

716
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,641
Get the fuck out of my house!

717
00:47:54,814 --> 00:47:56,815
You see this?
That means "not welcome."

718
00:48:09,662 --> 00:48:11,121
- What did I do?
- You disgust me!

719
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,456
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!

720
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,375
Primping your hair and your dress!

721
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:19,629
- Don't touch me! All tarted up!
- What did I do to you?

722
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:23,258
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?

723
00:48:23,426 --> 00:48:24,551
Aren't you ashamed?

724
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,013
I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!

725
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:35,228
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!

726
00:48:40,443 --> 00:48:43,403
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.

727
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:51,911
I'm so sorry, Doris.

728
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:54,247
I really am.

729
00:49:02,048 --> 00:49:05,592
- He's gone.
- He's just a boy...

730
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,844
...without a father.

731
00:49:08,596 --> 00:49:11,681
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

732
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:23,401
Goodbye.

733
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:10,281
Hey. You all right?

734
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,912
- Take this, you fucking dick!
- Hey, no. No, no, come here!

735
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,247
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

736
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:18,623
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

737
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:20,166
Let me go, goddamn it!

738
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:22,335
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

739
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:26,214
I would never hurt you. You know that.

740
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:28,425
Come on, I screwed up. I lost control.

741
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,009
It's not you.

742
00:50:30,177 --> 00:50:31,511
I'm sorry.

743
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:33,847
Come on, I'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.

744
00:50:34,014 --> 00:50:35,974
You know that. I'd do anything for you.

745
00:50:36,142 --> 00:50:37,350
I don't believe you.

746
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,602
I trust you, Derek.

747
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:42,939
[FRONT DOOR OPENS]

748
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,655
Hi.

749
00:50:50,823 --> 00:50:53,283
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?

750
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:55,368
- Want a plane ride?
- Yeah.

751
00:50:55,536 --> 00:50:57,370
DANNY:
Going for takeoff.

752
00:50:58,914 --> 00:51:01,749
- Woo-hoo!
- Heh-heh-heh.

753
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:03,001
Oh, no.

754
00:51:03,169 --> 00:51:05,003
No, no! Don't crash!

755
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,714
Gotta go to Mom.

756
00:51:07,882 --> 00:51:09,716
She's a crazy flier.

757
00:51:09,884 --> 00:51:13,553
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

758
00:51:14,346 --> 00:51:15,889

Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

1515
01:47:59,748 --> 01:48:02,458
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

1516
01:48:02,626 --> 01:48:05,128
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the clear.

1517
01:48:05,296 --> 01:48:07,755
- Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.

1518
01:48:07,923 --> 01:48:11,843
- It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1519
01:48:12,011 --> 01:48:14,262
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

1520
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:16,806
The way to find peace is to stick.

1521
01:48:17,641 --> 01:48:19,976
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

1522
01:48:20,144 --> 01:48:21,686
It might.

1523
01:48:23,105 --> 01:48:25,481
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you?

1524
01:48:25,649 --> 01:48:28,735
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

1526
01:48:31,822 --> 01:48:33,156
Man.

1527
01:48:35,117 --> 01:48:36,618
Fuck.

1528
01:48:41,582 --> 01:48:43,166
All right.

1529
01:48:45,336 --> 01:48:47,295
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1530
01:48:47,463 --> 01:48:50,173
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, well...

1531
01:48:50,341 --> 01:48:53,718
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that,
let me tell you.

1532
01:48:53,886 --> 01:48:57,138
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1533
01:48:57,306 --> 01:48:58,681
Come on.

1534
01:48:58,849 --> 01:49:02,143
SWEENEY: Hey, you. You got
something good for me this morning?

1535
01:49:02,311 --> 01:49:05,855
- I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.

1536
01:49:10,194 --> 01:49:11,694
DANNY:
What's going on?

1537
01:49:17,201 --> 01:49:18,660
Come on.

1538
01:49:34,551 --> 01:49:37,553
This is so bad for Seth, man.

1539
01:49:37,721 --> 01:49:40,890
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.

1540
01:49:41,058 --> 01:49:44,060
I'm glad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

1541
01:49:44,895 --> 01:49:46,187
Should we visit them?

1542
01:49:46,355 --> 01:49:48,481
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

1543
01:49:48,649 --> 01:49:50,984
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1544
01:49:51,151 --> 01:49:52,944
Listen, too...

1545
01:49:53,112 --> 01:49:57,156
...I saw a car cruising by the house last
night when I pulled out of there with Seth.

1546
01:49:57,324 --> 01:50:00,118
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

1547
01:50:00,285 --> 01:50:02,245
Make sure there's nothing going on.

1548
01:50:03,664 --> 01:50:05,540
Oh, man. This is bad.

1549
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:10,837
- They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.

1550
01:50:11,005 --> 01:50:12,672
If I made it through Chino...

1551
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,426
...this should be a piece of cake, right?

1552
01:50:16,593 --> 01:50:19,762
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1553
01:50:21,181 --> 01:50:22,598
Okay.

1554
01:50:23,183 --> 01:50:24,642
What are you gonna do?

1555
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:26,561
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

1556
01:50:26,729 --> 01:50:28,855
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

1557
01:50:29,023 --> 01:50:30,857
It's gonna be fine.

1558
01:50:31,025 --> 01:50:32,734
Go turn that paper in.

1559
01:50:34,945 --> 01:50:37,613
- Okay. All right, see you.
- Hey, hey, Dan.

1560
01:50:45,456 --> 01:50:47,081
I'll see you at home.

1561
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:50,585
All right?

1562
01:50:50,961 --> 01:50:52,211
Yeah, I'll see you.

1563
01:50:52,379 --> 01:50:54,547
- Hey, good luck, all right?
- Yeah.

1564
01:50:54,923 --> 01:50:56,466
See you later.

1566
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:04,348
- We're gonna be late.
DANNY: We'd better go.

1567
01:51:04,516 --> 01:51:07,101
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

1568
01:51:30,167 --> 01:51:33,086
- Fine.
- All right. I'll catch up with you, all right?

1569
01:51:33,337 --> 01:51:34,879
See you later.

1570
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:56,878
- Derek, no!
- Get out of my way!

1571
01:52:57,045 --> 01:52:59,130
- All right. All right.
- Get out of my way!

1572
01:52:59,298 --> 01:53:00,715
Let him go!

1573
01:53:02,384 --> 01:53:06,429
Oh, no. No! No! No!

1574
01:53:06,763 --> 01:53:08,931
Oh, Jesus.

1575
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,436
No.

1576
01:53:13,604 --> 01:53:17,773
Oh, no, no. No.

1577
01:53:32,331 --> 01:53:34,040
Oh, Jesus.

1578
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,375
God, what did I do?

1579
01:53:49,765 --> 01:53:54,227
Oh, God.

1580
01:54:05,155 --> 01:54:07,782
DANNY: So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1581
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:10,326
My conclusion, right?

1582
01:54:11,161 --> 01:54:13,246
Well, my conclusion is...

1583
01:54:13,413 --> 01:54:15,414
...hate is baggage.

1584
01:54:15,666 --> 01:54:18,960
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1585
01:54:19,503 --> 01:54:21,379
It's just not worth it.

1586
01:54:24,174 --> 01:54:27,301
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1587
01:54:27,803 --> 01:54:29,845
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1588
01:54:30,013 --> 01:54:34,517
...so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.

1589
01:54:34,685 --> 01:54:37,353
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1590
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:42,316
"We are not enemies, but friends.

1591
01:54:42,484 --> 01:54:44,902
We must not be enemies.

1592
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:47,280
Though passion may have strained...

1593
01:54:47,447 --> 01:54:50,700
...it must not break
our bonds of affection.

1594
01:54:50,867 --> 01:54:55,705
The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched...

1595
01:54:55,872 --> 01:55:00,501
...as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature."

1596
01:55:24,502 --> 01:58:50,502
