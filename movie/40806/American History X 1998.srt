德瑞

16
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,411
他們就在附近

17
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,139
我對他沒意見
I don't have a personal problem with him   okay?

18
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,350
別低估我的常識

你討厭他 我也知原因

22
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,825
沒了? 是嗎?
Nothing. Really? Hmm.

23
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,120
那報告簡直胡扯 (我的奮斗)
That paper   Bob   it's a travesty.

24
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,164
辨稱希特勒是民權英雄?
Arguing for Hitler as a civil-rights hero?

25
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,749
你該訂範圍
You've gotta draw the line.

26
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,001
你自找的麻煩
Murray   you actually did this to yourself.

27
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,629
叫他們寫任何一本...
You told them they could do a report on any book...

28
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,007
...爭取民權的讀書心得 用直白語言
...that related to the struggle for civil rights. In plain English.

29
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,007
我知道這孩子有點迷失
I am not disputing the fact that the child is confused

30
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,847
有些不當思想...

...但我不想放棄他
...but l am not ready to give up on him yet.

32
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,436
也許是他哥教唆的
His brother probably put him up to it.

33
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,606
跟你保證絕不是他哥
I can guarantee you 100 percent his brother did not put him up to this.

34
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,109
那我不太相信

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,781

- ...but that is dangerous. - Dangerous in what way?

37
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,617
寫得太過火了
Bob   that goes too far.

38
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,413
宣揚種族歧視? 納粹洗腦法?
This racist propaganda   this Mein Kampf psychobabble?

39
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,499
可被灌輸 也可以清醒
He learned this nonsense   Murray   and he can unIearn it too.

40
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,335
我不放棄這孩子

要我怎辦 丹尼?

46
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,164
什麼怎辦?
What's what gonna be?

47
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,750
你做的這個好事
This petty crap you're puillng.

48
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,753

好
Yeah.

54
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,276
德瑞早上回家了?

55
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,280

56
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,784
他曾是我學生 你知道 是嗎?

榮譽學生 非常聰明
Honors English. He was a brilliant student.

58
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,959
像你一樣 但他交一群腦筋簡單的朋友

叫我來是談德瑞?
Look   did you bring me in here to talk about Derek?

61
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,299
他的事跟我無關
Because what happened to him has nothing to do with me.

62
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,970
你現在所作所為都跟他有關
Everything you do right now has something to do with Derek.

63
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,722
這報告我寫得很棒

64
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,976
"我的奮斗"?

- 你以為我怕? - 你會死在街上
- You don't think I could handle it? - No   I think the street would kill you.

67
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,487
這精彩的文宣救不了你
Your rhetoric and your propaganda aren't gonna save you out there.

68
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,907

00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,690
有前科嗎?
Does he have a record?

137
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,067
都沒有
He's pretty clean.

138
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,861
一直搜證 但無所獲
Been trying to pin something to him   but it doesn't work.

139
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,739
背後全是他在掌控
Trust me. He's behind all of it.

140
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,200
活動都在他家外面進行
He runs everything out of his house down by the beach.

141
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,913
開曼和溫亞結合後 維尼斯才有了白人幫派
No white gangs in Venice Beach before Cameron Alexander and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

142
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,083
開曼發現德瑞是個人才
AIexander found in Derek his shining prince.

143
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,254
就利用他召集一群...

144
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,422
...沒安全感 易受影響的孩子
...frustrated and impressionable kids.

145
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,260
溫亞有很重的包袱...
This kid Vinyard   well   he's got a lot of baggage...

146
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,389
...在這卷NBC帶子 可以看得出
...as you'll see in this tape that we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

147
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,023
本郡消防員旦尼溫亞...
L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard...

148
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,694
...在康頓區毒窟救火時被槍殺
...was shot and kilied battllng a blaze at a suspected Compton drug den.

149
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,612
記者正在溫亞家...
We're at the Vinyard home right now...

150
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,783
溫亞的大兒子 德瑞 願接受訪問
...and lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son   Derek   has agreed to talk with us.

151
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,745
德瑞 請下來一下好嗎?
Derek   if you could come down here   please   for just a second.

152
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,791
請談談你現在的感覺
Look   I know this is tough   but   um   how do you feel right now?

153
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,460
你說呢 什麼感覺?
How do you think I feel?

154
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,840
- 這是個象征 - 象征 為什麼?
- I think it's typical. - Typical   how?

155
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,719
這國家成了犯罪者天堂 你還指望什麼?
This country's becoming a haven for criminals   so   what do you expect?

156
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,138
像我爸這樣辛勤的人...
Decent   hardworking Americans like my dad...

157
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,391
...被社會寄生蟲掠奪一切

158
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,226
寄生蟲?
Parasites?

159
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,897
那些黑人 棕色人 黃人
Blacks   browns   yellow   whatever.

160
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,189
我沒搞明白
I don't understand.

161
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,483
你是說他的死跟種族有關?
You're saying your father's murder was race-related?

162
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,485
對 種族問題
Yeah   it's race-related.

163
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,281
不僅僅是犯罪 所有問題都因為種族
Every problem in this country is race-related   not just crime.

164
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,201
移民 愛滋 福利  都是黑人社會...
Immigration   AIDS   welfare. Those are problems of the black community...

165
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,330
...拉丁社會 亞裔社會的問題 不是白人問題
...the Hispanic community   Asian community. Not white problems.

166
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,498
不是因為貧窮?
Aren't those issues that deal more with poverty?

167
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,586
不是 不是環境使然 那是胡扯
No. They're not products of their environments   either. That's crap.

168
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,963
少數民族才不管國家怎樣
Minorities don't give two shits about this country.

169
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,549
他們是來剝削 而非擁抱
They come here to exploit it   not to embrace it.

170
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,969
幾百萬歐洲白人來此發展繁榮
millions of white European-Americans came here and flourished.

171
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,181
已經一世代了 他們怎麼回事?
Within a generation. What the fuck is the matter with these people?

172
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,934
要殺個消防員
They have to go around shooting at firemen.

173
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,478
- 這與你父親的死有何關連?

174
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,230
- 他是執行公務被殺

175
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,524
去黑人社區滅火...
Putting out a fire in a nigger neighborhood...

176
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,526
...他不去理就好了
...he shouldn't have given a shit about.

177
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,364
殺他的毒販也許還領失業金呢
He got shot by a fucking drug dealer who probably coliects a welfare check.

178
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,324
- 別說了 - 我很遺憾
- That's enough. - I'm sorry.

179
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,369
德瑞溫亞服刑三年多...

180
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,746
...今早出獄

181
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,457
我們得持續關心此事
I think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.

182
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,417
萬一他出事...
If something happens to him...

183
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,045
...這媟|很不平靜
...things could get very ugly down by the beach.

184
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,463
低調行事
Just keep it low.

185
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,884
以前維尼斯海灘不是這樣
Venice Beach didn't always look like this.

186
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,470
以前環境很棒
It used to be a great neighborhood.

187
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,472
紅磚道雖坑坑巴巴...
The boardwalk's always been a dump...

188
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,516
...但我們搬來這堮...

189
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,185
...維尼斯是很適合居住的地方

190
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,815
幾年後 就完了
Over the years   though   it's just gone to hell.

191
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,067
幫派像瘟疫般
The gangs are like a plague.

192
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,945
他們從英格塢和南中移來...
They moved west from Inglewood and South Central...

193
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,530
...占領了這
...and basically took over.

194
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,991
我沒犯規 你腦子有病?
It ain't fouling you. What's wrong with you?

195
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,495
我操你全家

196
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,582
我沒時間管這檔子鳥事
I ain't got time for all the bullshit.

197

- You all right? - I'm all right.

199
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,299

Yo   is that that fool you was telling me about?

200
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,927

Bitch-ass motherfucker.

203
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,781
所以德瑞加入門徒幫
That's why Derek started the D.O.C.

204

他說白人
He said white kids shouldn't have to

205
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,286
在自己社區不該害怕
walk around scared in their own neighborhood.

206
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,373
他一度真把社區奪回來了
For a while there   he really made it like it was ours again.

...it's not worth the effort to screen for convicted felons.

499
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,663
誰在乎? 政府不在乎
Who gives a shit? Our government doesn't give a shit.

勤勞的美國人被耍了...
It's about decent   hardworking Americans falling through the cracks...

508
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,857

現在貧窮的是我們
Well   it's Americans who are tired and hungry and poor.

513
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,122
問題尚未解決前 應停止移民!
And l say until you take care of that   close the fucking book!

514

...so that a bunch of fucking foreigners can come in and exploit our country.

518
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,970
這不是遠處發生的事
And this isn't something that's going on far away.

519
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,015
不是遙不可及之地發生的事
This isn't happening in places we can't do anything about it.

520

...and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.

526
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,913
看著這些屁事 都沒人管
I see this shit going on and I don't see anybody doing anything about it.

527
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,915
我非常不爽!
And it fucking pisses me off!

528
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,002
你們放眼看看
So look around you.

529
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,256
這已經不是我們的家園 這堣w成戰場了
This isn't our neighborhood. It's a battlefield.

530
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,384
這堿O戰場 你有兩條路:
We're on a battlefield tonight. Make a decision.

531
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,512
你們就眼睜睜站在一邊...
Are we gonna stand on the sidelines...

532
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,473
...看著自己國家被蹂躪?
...quietly standing there while our country gets raped?

533
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,058
幹
Fuck that.

534
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,018
還是要拼一拼?
Are we gonna ante up and do something?

535
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,687
- 對 去拼! - 對 去拼!
- Fuck   yeah! - Hell   yeah!

536
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,505
當然要拼
You're goddamn right we are.

537
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,077
死過來!
Come here!

538
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:13,039
你知不知道雇非法移民犯法 亞洲豬?
Don't you know it's against the law to hire border-jumpers   you nip bastard?

539
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,002
我操 我操!
Fuck that! Fuck that!

540
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,092
甜心 別害怕 我不會害你
Sweetheart. No   you don't need this. We're not gonna hurt you.

541
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,845
求你不要!
Please! Please   no!

542
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,140
拉丁賤貨!
You fucking spic!

543
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,854
我想這婊子餓了
You know what? I think this bitch is hungry.

544
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,064
她太臭 來些清潔劑
This bitch stinks. Get me cleaning products.

545
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,150
味道像臭魚爛蝦
Smells like fish and chips and guacamole.

546
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,609
給你的
Here we go.

547
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,653
這樣就對了
Yeah   that's it.

548
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,086
起來!
Get the fuck up!

549
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,967
去死吧!
Get down!

550
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,572
墨西哥萬歲

551
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,685
來點豆子吧 豆人
Have some fucking beans   you goddamn beaner.

552
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,689
- 搶走老子工作 - 你個賤人!
- Take my job. - You donkey bitch!

553
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,445
那邊也來點
Get some of that in there.

554
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,740
- 倒下去 - 顏色很棒
- Throw it on   throw it on. - Hey   that's a great color on you.

555
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,700
你可以幹白人的活了 賤人
You can get a white woman's job   bitch.

556
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,578
- 比幹這爛差事強 - 就是
- A Iittle better than this one   huh? - Yeah.

557
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,790
- 白人 - 你可以升級了
- White. - You can move up in the world   huh?

558
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,876
混蛋!
Asshole!

559
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,757
走了 離開這 全都出去 快!
Let's go. We're out of here. Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now!

560
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,303
好了 大家走!
All right   let's go! Let's go!

561
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,723
- 快走  - 快走 快走 快走
- Let's go. - Come on   let's go   let's go   let's go.

562
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,642
快走
Let's go.

563
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,940
沒綠卡 別想工作 聽懂沒?
No green card   no fucking work   comprendes?

564
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,985
- 快走 快走! - 走 走
- Come on. Come on! - Go   go   go.

565
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,487
收工了! 快走!
We're fucking done! Come on!

566

(美國曆史X檔案) (丹尼·溫亞著)

567
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,684
爸死了 事情漸漸平靜了
Dad was gone. But things were almost normal again.

568
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,354
德瑞工作不錯 媽也好多了
Derek had a good job. Mom was starting to live a little.

569
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,692
大家心情都好 沒想到禍事會臨頭
Everyone was feeling so good that we just didn't see it coming.

570
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,485
我們早該想到的
Maybe we should have.

571
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,197
諷刺的是暴動中被毀的店...
The irony is that most of the stores that were destroyed during the riots...

572
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,950
- ...多是黑人的店 - 笨
- ...were owned by black people. - That's stupid   though.

573
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,577
幹嘛砸自己社區的店?
Why trash your own neighborhood?

574
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,538
我就說那是毫無理性
Well   that's my point. It's an irrational act.

575
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:03,001
那些感覺被社會忽視的人...
It's like an expression of rage by people who feel neglected...

576
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,711
...用這方式表達不滿
...and turned away by the system.

577
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,672
沒錯 就像衛茲那次...
Exactly. I mean   it's like we had in Watts...

578
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,258
...或68年芝加哥暴動那次...
...or the riots in Chicago in '68...

579
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,885
胡扯 我不同意
I don't buy that for a minute.

580
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,722
什麼叫無理性的表達 你是逃避
calling a riot an irrational expression of rage   that's such a cop-out.

581
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,349
他們是差勁的機會主義者 一群人...
It's opportunism at its worst. A bunch of people...

582
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,644
...逮到機會就去搶 僅此而已
...grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store. Nothing more.

583
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,813
這些搶自己社區商店的人...
The fact these people ripped off stores...

584
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,649
...讓其他人對法律...
...in their own communities reflects that these people...

585
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,610
...完全喪失信心
...have no respect for the law.

586
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:33,156
更別提社區意識或公民義務了
And certainly no concept of community or civic responsibility.

587
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,910
慢著 白人也對會白人施暴
Wait a minute. White people commit crimes against white people too.

588
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,413
但白人不會在全國殺人放火
But they're not offing each other in record numbers all over America.

589
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,415
拜托 看看統計數字
Look at the statistics   for christ sakes.

590
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,003
三分之一黑人男性正接受懲治教化
One in every three black maIes is in some phase of the correctional system.

591
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:51,174
是巧合嗎 或是那種族有犯罪天分?
Is that a coincidence or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?

592
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,510
不僅如此 他們還很驕傲
Not only that. They're proud of it.

593
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,721
也許是司法制度有偏見
Maybe it says something about prejudice in the judicial system.

594
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,765
你要談犯罪率...
If you wanna taIk about criminal statistics...

595
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,602
...該看看這社會的不公平
...you might wanna take a look at the social inequallties that produce them.

596
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,771
對 我最恨這個
Yap   yap. You know what? That's exactIy what l hate.

597
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,790
因為你每次都指鹿為馬...
Because you're taking one thing and calling it something else...

598
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,945
...強把他們應負的責任淡化掉
...and alieviating the responsibility that these people have for their own actions.

599
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,613
就好像說:
It's like saying:

600
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,075
"不是暴動 是憤怒 不是犯罪 是貧窮"
"It's not a riot   it's rage. It's not crime   it's poverty."

601
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:21,371
全是鬼扯 法庭也這樣
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit. It's exactly what happened in this trial too.

602
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,958
媒體亂報導 所以大家就只注意那些條子...
Because the media twisted things around so people focused on these cops...

603
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,668
...會不會定罪...
...whether they'd get convicted...

604
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,963
...隆尼金的權利有沒被侵害
...and whether Rodney King's civil rights had been violated.

605
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,257
忽略了隆尼本身
Everybody lost sight of Rodney King himseIf.

606
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,385
他自己承認犯下多起案子
The guy's a multiple felon by his own admission.

607
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,639
他尾巴翹天上 在高速公路開時速120公
He's high as a goddamn kite   driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.

608
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,560
被條子攔下 他攻擊他們
He gets pulied over by a bunch of cops   and he attacks them.

609
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,312
攻擊條子 那是底線 然後他離開了
He attacked police officers. Bottom Iine. And he walked.

610
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,316
一個痞子經過 正好拍下...
And there's some yahoo with a video camera who turned it on halfway through...

611
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,360
...我們就只看到條子打他
...so all we see is them hitting him.

612
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,573
波威和庫恩用警棍打他...
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up and cracking him with billy clubs...

613
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,284
...布奡迉揖L後腦勺
...and Briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull.

614
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,786
大家就說: "好可憐"
And people are going   "Oh   this poor guy."

615
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,162
他打四個條子
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

616
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,249
條子卻要因完全正當的防衛...
And those cops end up on the stand defending themselves...

617
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,794
...上台接受審訊
...for using absoluteIy standard   textbook self-defense procedures.

618
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,021
影帶中不是那樣
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

619
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,008
你反對? 你成了有關當局啦 媽?
You didn't think so? And what   you're an authority   Ma?

620
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,343
你說呢 莫瑞?
Murray   what do you think?

621
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,932
我覺得警察打得很過分
I did think that the police used their clubs rather excessively.

622
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,436
什麼叫過分? 那非常正當
Who are you to say what's excessive? I think it was totally approprlate.

623
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,522
他們的判斷力比你強
They're in a better position to make that call than you are.

624
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,614
社會賦予條子
In fact   we as society   grant cops

625
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:33,860
那種職權...
a certain amount of authority to make those calls...

626
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,780
...因為我們承認他們的工作很危險
...because we acknowledge that their job is difficult and dangerous.

627
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,701
但不幸的是 太少人尊重那種職權
You know? Unfortunately   very few people   Iike   respect that authority.

628
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,704
你尊重誰啦 三K黨
Look who's talking about respect here   Mr. Junior-KKK.

629
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,831
- 什麼? - 黛薇娜
- What? - Davina.

630
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,876
想念大學就先聽好 黛薇娜
You wanna go to coliege   Davina? You should Iearn to listen.

631
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,046
法律是很爛 我承認那是因為條子職權
I didn't say I respected laws. I acknowledge a cop's authority.

632
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,549
但我更惡心讓那些讓罪犯逍遙在外的法律
I don't respect Iaws that let monkeys like Rodney King on the street.

633
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,509
第二: 我不是那種...
Second   l am not   as you well know...

634
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:03,389
...沒組織 低級的三K黨員
...a member of a low-rent   disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

635
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,892
拜托 別胡扯了
Please. So take your head out of your ass.

636
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,603
你根本沒重點
You've gotten off the point.

637
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,399
- 我說的是重點 - 是嗎? 重點在哪?
- I had a point. That wasn't the point. - Do you have one? What is your point?

638
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,401
你想想看
All right   think about this.

639
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,737
那天晚上換做是丹尼在街上...
If Danny had been walking across the street that night...

640
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,691
- ...被隆尼打了...
- ...and Rodney King had plowed into him...

641
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,283
- 別再談隆尼了
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

642
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,710
誰要吃甜點了?
Who would like some dessert?

643
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,588
我們在討論
We're having a discussion.

644
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,007
我們在很認真的討論
We're having a nice discussion   right?

645
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,843
若隆尼喝了酒 嗑了藥...
If Rodney King had been hopped up on Chivas Regal and PCP...

646
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,096
...殺死丹尼 你看法就會不同
...and kilied Danny   you'd sing a different tune.

647
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,807
你我都沒看見他打人
I didn't see him hit anybody and neither did you.

648
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,725
正好他沒殺人
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

649
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,978
- 謝天謝地 - 小聲點 愛莉在睡
- Thank God. - Keep it down   okay? Ally's sleeping.

650
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,556
若他殺了人呢?
If he had   though?

651
00:44:55,557 --> 00:44:57,777
若那猩猩碾死孩子...
Come on   think about it. If that monkey had run some kid over...

652
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,863
...你就會有不同看法了
...everybody would have a different opinion of this matter.

653
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,741
焦點該是隆尼 而不是條子
They'd be focused on Rodney King and not on these officers.

654
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,202
卻說他只是攻擊警察
But instead   he just attacked a few cops.

Cut him some slack until he can overcome these historical injustices.

660
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,885

It's crap. This stuff you guys are saying perpetuates it.

661
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,429
什麼自由啦
All this liberal nonsense.

662

Are you saying that it's wrong to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

Well   look at the way that they scapegoated Chief Gates.

670
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,752
他們對黑警長客氣的很?
They'd come down that hard on black Willie Williams?

788
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,487
嘴咬住邊欄
Put your fucking mouth on the curb.

789
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,655
別這樣!

00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:18,300
他腦袋被炸開的聲音...

806
00:56:18,405 --> 00:56:21,033
久久揮不去

807

她不開門?
She ain't gonna open the door?

We'll let the niggers   kikes and spics grab for their piece of the pie.

難怪他們
Can't blame them.

887
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,893

Of course   they're gonna have to fight to get it.

888
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,855
能把他們趕走...

...我們若有死傷也值得

你說要組織?
You talk about organization?

917
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,214
看過我們網路你就知道
Wait till you see what we've done with the lnternet.

918
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:26,051
西雅圖到聖地牙哥的幫派 全都集結了
We've got every gang from Seattle to San Diego working together now.

919
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,470
幫派不再競爭 他們團結了
They're not competing. They're consolldated.

920
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,014
我們只缺全盤的領導
Only thing we lack is a little overall leadership.

921
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,934
你來的正是時候

- 別再搞砸店... - 你沒聽懂
- No more of this grocery store... - You're not listening to me.

930
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:01,461
我受夠了 我不吃你那套狗屎了
I am done with it. All that bullshit out there and all your bullshit too.

931
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,129

I understand how you feel. You've just done some hard time...

933

別跟我說難受
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.

934
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,720
- 你根本不懂 - 我坐過牢
- You don't know a thing about it. - I done mine.

935
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:13,139
屁 那是你編的
You didn't do shit. I found out about your story.

936
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:16,935
坐兩個月 你就叫兩個孩子當替死鬼
You did two months   then rolied over on two kids and let them go down for you.

937
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,104
別再唬我了 開曼!

939
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,526
談不下去了
I'm done.

940
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,070
你去冷靜冷靜
Look   you go cool off. Get Iaid. Do something.

941
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,948
清醒後再來找我
Get your head on straight   then l'll talk to you.

942
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,075
沒有我也沒關系 是嗎?
But it doesn't matter if l don't   does it?

943
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,536
有一堆人替你效命...

德瑞 嘴巴幹淨點
Hey   Derek. Watch it. Be careful.

949
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,551
看看這是誰的地盤
Remember where you are.

950
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,263
這不是能隨意進出的小酒吧...
This is not a fucking country club where you can waltz in and out of here...

951
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,098
閉上狗嘴!

You can do whatever you want   but Danny is a good kid.

01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,042
- 你好嗎? - 還好
- How you doing? - Good.

1049
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,711
請坐
Have a seat.

1050
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:44,090
- 我是史派 幸會 - 嗨
- Spike. Good to meet you. - Hey.

1051
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,728
別惹我 我是這堻怌ㄘう漱H
Don't fuck with me   all right? Because I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.

1052
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:58,813
知道為什麼?
You know why?

1053
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,607
因為我控制內褲
Because I control the underwear.

1054
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,951
從這堮釣 到那邊分類
All right   we pick them up over here and we sort them over there.

1055
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,912
你最好認真點 上次派來的那人...
I hope you work out   all right? The last guy they sent me...

1056
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:19,042
...沒穿過內褲 號碼都不會分...
...didn't wear no drawers   couldn't read the sizes in the drawers...

1057
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,002
...只愛聞內褲
...and used to sniff the drawers.

1058
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,254
號碼有兩個: 中和大 明白嗎?
We got two sizes: medium and large. All right?

1059
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,882
只要把中的歸中...
All you do is put the mediums with the mediums...

1060
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,592
...大的歸大
...and the large with the large.

1061
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,346
很無聊 但總比在廚房好
It's a boring job   but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.

1062
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:35,767
我在那待了兩年 整天洗那些臭鍋
I spent two years in the kitchen   ha   scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1063
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:38,728
你不會喜歡那差事的
That   you don't wanna do. All right?

1064
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,938
你該高興被派到這
You should be happy that you landed this job.

1065
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:44,442
別的爛差事一堆
Ain't no tellng what the hell they'll have you do in the joint.

1066
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,320
順便問下...
By the way   uh...

1067
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,365
...你犯了什麼罪進來的?
...what are you in for?

1068
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,620
搶了老太太?
Probably robbed some old lady   huh?

1069
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:09,092
我知道你是哪種人
Okay   l know your kind   right?

1070
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,469
暴躁的窮白鬼
Badass peckerwood with an attitude.

1071
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,223
我告訴你
Well   let me tell you something   man.

1072
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,100
你最好小心點
You better watch your ass.

1073
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,018
在牢...
Because in the joint...

1074
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,145
...黑鬼是你 不是我
...you the nigger   not me.

1075
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,736
一年後 我覺得很安全了
l was a year in. I thought I was cruising.

1076
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,656
情況卻越來越複雜
Then everything started getting complicated.

1077
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,349
我來搞定
I'll take care of that   all right?

1078
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,143
那在幹嘛?
What the fuck is that?

1079
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,479
搞什麼鬼?
What's that all about?

1080
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,858
那是政治 給好處
Oh   that's just politics   man. Favors   you know.

1081
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,112
他給拉丁豬好處?
He's doing favors for that fucking spic?

1082
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:17,201
米奇跟他們私下有點生意
Mitch has got a little something extra on the side with them boys   you know.

1083
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,287
你騙我 對吧?
You're kidding   right?

1084
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:21,456
沒有
No.

1085
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,501
真是狗屎 該跟他說一下
That's bullshit   man. Somebody should say something to him.

1086
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,253
他腦子壞啦?
What the fuck is he thinking?

1087
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,714
你活到今天全靠米奇
Mitch is the only reason why you're not a corpse right now.

1088
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,092
- 別忘了 - 我可不在乎
- Remember that. - You know what? l don't fucking give a shit.

1089
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,387
我能靠自己 他不該做那事
I can take care of myself. He shouldn't be doing that.

1090
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,557
我要吐了 說牢埵h恐怖...
I'm getting sick of it. A lot of hard talk around here...

1091
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,976
...根本是鬼扯
...and not a lot of follow-through.

1092
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,230
你最好別太激動...
I think you'd better chill out...

1093
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:50,193
...嘴巴幹淨點 我受夠你那套了
...on the preaching bullshit   okay? We're getting a little tired of that shit.

1094
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,738
安分點
Ease up on it.

1095
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,478
你來幹嘛 媽?
What are you doing here   Doris?

1096
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,271
我在附近
I was in the neighborhood.

1097
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,066
叫你們別來看我
Well   look   I told you I don't want you all coming here.

1098
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:33,110
我管不了了
I don't care what you told me   okay?

1099
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,570
我有事找你
I need to talk to you now.

1100
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:56,717
你們都好嗎?

戴薇娜很棒 功課都是A
Davina's great. She's   uh   getting straight A's almost.

...and starting to talk a little.

1104
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,735
- 丹尼呢? - 丹尼?
- How's Danny? - Danny?

1105
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,572
丹尼

丹尼他好崇拜你
He holds you up so high.

1107
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,995
他把你當神
He thinks you're the greatest.

1108
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,957
常在開曼和朋友面前...
He's always bragging about you to Cameron...

1109
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,917
...誇贊你
...and all his new friends.

1110
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,715
他讓我想到你
He's starting to remind me of you.

1111
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,551
老天 別那麼擔心
Jesus   don't sound so worried   all right?

1112
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,219
他沒事的
I'm sure he's fine.

1113
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:44,181
他16歲了 不會永遠是個小天使
I mean   he's 16 years old   Doris. He's not gonna be a little angel forever.

1114
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,019
我看見大兒子毀了一生...
You think because l watched my first-born fuck up his entire life...

1115
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:52,189
...能讓小兒子也步他後塵嗎?
...that l can sit here and see my baby follow him down the same toliet?

1116
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:54,984
我在坐牢 能怎辦? 別拿這煩我
You know what? I can't fix all this shit from up here   okay?

1117
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,527
沒要你怎辦
I'm not asking you to.

1118
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,864
我待在這夠苦 你還過來折磨我
It makes me feel bad. I'm trying to get through this   you make it harder.

1119
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,034
只有你苦嗎 德瑞?
You think you're the only one doing time   Derek?

1120
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,620
你一個人受苦?
You think you're here all alone?

1121
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,622
你在這 我會好過?
You think I'm not in here with you?

1122
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,677
操
Fuck   man.

1123
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,726
這樣搞床單 就以為搞得完?
Every day you go through these sheets like you gonna get to the end of them.

1124
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:32,313
黑鬼 別板個臉
Look   nigga   will you chill the fuck out?

1125
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,691
媽的! 不管你做多快...
Goddamn! No matter how fast you get through them   man...

1126
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,361
...他們還是會不斷送來
...they'll keep bringing them in and bringing them in.

1127
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:42,239
用丟的只會害你心髒病
Throwing them around ain't gonna do a thing but give you a heart attack.

1128
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,908
我是無所謂
Know what? That's cool with me.

1129
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,494
但我也快被你嚇出心髒病了!
But you're gonna give me a goddamn heart attack too!

1130
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,755
我知道 我是蠢黑鬼
I know   I know. I'm just a dumb stupid nigger   right?

1131
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,632
我懂個屁?
What do I know?

1132
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:04,303
但我不會拿床單出氣
I know l ain't the one getting mad at them damn sheets   though.

1133
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:08,891
會讓我生氣的 是這個:
As a matter of fact   the only sheets I get mad at? I'll tell you.

1134
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,604
"各位 這麼辦
"Boys   this is what we gonna do.

1135
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,439
今天我們來恨黑鬼
We gonna hate some niggers.

1136
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:19,443
大家恨黑鬼 恨黑鬼一天
We gonna hate some goddamn niggers. That's all we'll do   is hate niggers all day.

1137
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,029
還沒想到恨哪個 隨便恨
I don't know what a nigger is   but we'll hate them.

1138
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,115
我表弟德瑞在牢...
My cousin Derek is in the pen right now...

1139
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:28,369
...跟一個黑鬼工作 快被搞瘋了"
...working next to a nigger   driving him nigger crazy."

1140
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:48,889
你看 這才像話
See? That's the ticket.

1141
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,851
好好做
Nice and easy.

1142
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,478
井水不犯河水
Now we can ignore each other in peace.

1143
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,568
我說 "你在幹嘛?" 知道他告訴我什麼?
I go   "What you doing?" Know what he tells me?

1144
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,821
他說: "我想操的那豬更爛"
He goes   "lt's better than the pig I just tried to fuck."

1145
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,117
都不讓我說完
Never lets me finish.

1146
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:10,995
- 說個笑話吧? - 你也操了他?
- Why don't you tell a joke? - Did you fuck him too?

1147
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:16,959
我回去 她躺著 她喜歡用啤酒瓶搞自己
I get back   she's laying on her back. She Iikes the wine bottIe thing   right?

1148
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,670
怎麼了?
What's up?

1149
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,803
講重點好嗎? 老天
Will you get to the fucking point? Jesus Christ.

1150
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,855
他向墨西哥人買貨 賣自己人
He was taking it from the Mexicans and dealing it out to his own people.

1151
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,484
那些人完全沒有良知
He didn't believe in shit. None of them did.

1152
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,736
花了太長時間
Took too damn long.

1153
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:53,120
溫亞!
Hey. Hey   Vinyard!

1154
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,511
幹嘛?
What?

1155
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,597
別那樣看我
Come on   man. Don't look at me like that.

1156
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,141
知道這味道吧?
You know what that smells like   right?

1157
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,394
這會讓人想起女人
Come on   don't tell me this smell doesn't remind you of a woman.

1158
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,356
真想念那味道
God   I miss that smell   man.

1159
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,819
我在外面的工作也沒多好
The job l had on the outside wasn't much better than this one.

1160
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,572
但至少回家都能躺在這味道旁
But at least l gotta go home at night and lie down next to this sweet smell.

1161
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,536
天哪 想死了
God   I miss that.

1162
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,205
你有女人嗎?
You got a woman?

1163
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,873
你一定有女人
Yeah   you got a woman   man.

1164
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,709
給你一些忠告
Let me give you some advice. All right?

1165
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:42,920
如果她來看你...
She comes to visit you...

1166
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:47,591
...無論如何 在她離開前千萬別吵架
...whatever you do   no matter what   don't Iet her leave here in a fight.

1167
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:50,845
別讓她走時心情不好...
Don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude. If you do...

1168
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:55,766
...否則你每天都會擔心 她會去找別人上床
...you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody eIse.

1169
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,228
所以她來時 跟她說些好聽的
She comes to see you it's nothing but sweet talk through that gIass.

1170
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,772
讓她開心的離開
Send her away floating   all right?

1171
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,942
這堣ㄨ野~面 你可以跟她吵...
Because it's not like the real world. Where you can fight...

1172
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,696
...吵完再來個"補償性"做愛
...but it's cooI to fight because you can make up and have make-up sex.

1173
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,949
你知道的 憤怒做愛 邊氣邊做愛
You know what l'm saying? That angry sex. That sex with an attitude.

1174
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:15,619
你可以背朝天 讓她打你 把氣發出來
Where you lay on your back and let her take out all that aggression on you.

他們保護你!
They were protecting your stupid ass!

1303
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:17,053
你還公然挑釁
You dissed them in public.

1304
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:19,264
現在沒人靠了!
Now you're on your fucking own!

1305
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,641
小心我那幫兄弟
Yo   man   l'm talking about the brothers.

1306
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:25,479
他們會操你 扁你 宰了你!
They're gonna fuck you   toss your salad   then smoke your motherfucking ass!

1307
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:29,566
說點我不知道的吧  你以為我沒想過?
Tell me something l don't already know. You think I haven't thought about that?

1308
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:32,861
要來就讓他們來 我無能為力
They're gonna come for me   they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.

1309
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:37,282
我能怎樣?
What can I do   man?

1310
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,747
我又回到以前
So I was right back where I started.

1311
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,665
每天都想: 他們要來了
Every day   I was sure it was my day.

1312
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:49,961
每當我走出牢房時
Every time I stepped out of my cell.

1313
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,589
每當我進那浴室時
Every time I got in that shower.

1314
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,554
我想他們有所行動是遲早的事
I figured it was only a matter of time before they made a move.

1315
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,642
我只希望快點來臨
I just hoped that it'd be quick.

1316
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:37,342
但他們沒有再來
But it never came.

1317
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:41,888
我猜不透 我知道有人很想扁我
I couldn't figure it out. I knew some of them were itching for it.

1318
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:44,474
之後 我就獨來獨往...
But after a while l just put my head down...

1319
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:47,978
...埋頭去讀西尼給我的那些書
...read the stuff that Sweeney sent me   and I kept to myself.

1320
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,275
最後那六個月 我像個鬼魂
The last six months in that place I was like a ghost.

1321
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,583
怎樣? 要出去啦?
What's up   man? You getting out?

1322
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:15,672
還等什麼? 快滾啊
What the fuck you waiting on? Get the fuck on out of here.

1323
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:21,469
- 我有個奇怪感覺 - 什麼?
- Yeah   you know   I got this funny feeling. - Oh   yeah? What's that?

1324
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:27,767
我覺得我能平安離開是因為你
I'm thinking maybe the only reason I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.

1325
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,978
少來 快滾吧 你!
Come on   man. Get the fuck out of here   man!

1326
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:33,607
我會為白雞拼自己老命?
You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line for a crazy-ass peckerwood?

1327
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:37,694
對 我是白癡
Yeah. Right. Stupid.

1328
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,368
我是這麼猜想
That's what l thought.

1329
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:51,541
我欠你
I owe you   man.

1330
01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:54,711
你欠我個屁
Man   you don't owe me shit   all right?

1331
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,923
我欠你
Yes   l do.

1332
01:34:08,851 --> 01:34:10,185
你也快走了
You'll be out in no time.

1333
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,479
放心 小意思
Come on   man. It's a piece of cake. All right?

1334
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,692
小心那些兄弟 小心點!
You just take it easy on the brothers   all right? The brothers!

1335
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:30,246
天哪
God   man.

1336
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:34,417
我很難過 德
I'm sorry   Der.

1337
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,212
你的那些事
Sorry that happened to you.

1338
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:41,383
我不難過 我很幸運
No   I'm not. I'm lucky.

1339
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,134
因為我知道...
I feel Iucky because...

1340
01:34:43,302 --> 01:34:45,220
...那些是錯的 丹
...it's wrong   Dan.

1341
01:34:46,972 --> 01:34:50,934
它啃噬了我 幾乎害我送命
It's wrong and it was eating me up. It was gonna kill me.

1342
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,812
我不斷問自己...
And l kept asking myself all the time...

1343
01:34:53,979 --> 01:34:56,940
...當初怎會相信那些的?
...how did I buy into this shit   you know?

1344
01:34:58,609 --> 01:35:00,860
是因為氣憤
And it's just because I was pissed off.

1345
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:05,156
我做的一切都沒趕走憤恨
And nothing l ever did ever took that feeling away.

1346
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,952
丹尼 我殺了兩個人哪
I mean   l killed two guys   Danny. I killed them.

1347
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:13,707
但還是沒覺得平靜
And that didn't make me feel any different.

1348
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:18,086
只是更迷失 我覺得好膩
It just got me more lost. And l'm tired of feeling pissed off   Danny.

1349
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:20,630
讓我好厭倦
I'm just tired of it.

1350
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,134
我不是要你做什麼
And l'm not telling you what to do.

1351
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:26,636
真的不是
I'm really not.

1352
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,639
但我需要你了解
But l need you to understand.

1353
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:33,977
因為我愛你 你是我最好的朋友
Because I love you and you're my best friend.

1354
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:38,565
你了解嗎?
Do you understand?

1355
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,692
我了解
Yeah   l understand.

1356
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:45,822
好了
All right.

1357
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:51,202
天哪
Jesus.

1358
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:10,930
- 沒事吧? - 都很好
- Everything okay? - No   everything's great.

1359
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,683
你想睡我們的房媔?
Great. Yeah. You wanna sIeep in our room?

1360
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:17,145
- 不了 謝謝 這堳雃n  - 真的?
- No   thank you. Yeah. This is good. l'm fine. - You sure?

1361
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,481
謝謝你
Thank you   though.

1362
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,941
我們走吧
All right. Come on   let's go.

1363
01:36:42,838 --> 01:36:44,380
晚安
Good night.

1364
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,199
我去洗個澡
I'm gonna take a shower   all right?

1365
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:31,321
去回想你親人的那些事 真的很痛苦
It's hard to look back and see the truth about people you love.

1366
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:35,658
若問德瑞那些事是始於何時...
I think if you asked Derek why it all went the way it did   and where it all started...

1367
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:38,494
...他可能會說 是爸被謀殺後
...he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.

1368
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:41,956
但其實是更早以前
But the truth is   it started earlier.

1369
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:45,251
晚上一起去看球賽嗎?
All right. Are we all meeting together for the game tonight?

1370
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,753
當然
Yes   definitely.

1371
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,547
地點在本伯格 七點集合 看帥哥打球
Ben's Burgers   7:00   then we go watch the big guy play.

1372
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:51,925
好的
Okay. Yeah.

1373
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:55,511
- 心埵陪蒬ぃa? - 一直都有
- Psyching up for the game? - Yeah   I'm always ready for that.

1374
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,682
要考英文 有點緊張 我還沒准備好
I got an English exam third period. I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.

1375
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,477
怎麼 怕考個B?
What's the matter   afraid you're gonna get a B?

1376
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:04,479
B減也無所謂
Might do you good. B minus.

1377
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,357
別笑我 他真的不一樣
Don't laugh. This guy is different.

1378
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:11,986
西尼博士太神了 我沒碰過這種老師
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable. I've never had a teacher like this.

1379
01:39:12,154 --> 01:39:14,948
是雙學位博士 竟然來教我們
He's got two Ph.D.s. I don't know what he's doing at our school.

1380
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:18,201
- 他跟其他老師不同 - 叫你念什麼?
- He's not like other teachers. - What's he got you reading?

1381
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,871
我們要考"土著"這本書
We got this essay exam on this book   Native Son.

1382
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:24,540
- 以它出題 - "土著" 我沒聽過
- All on this one book. - Native Son. l don't know that.

1383
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,959
真是大新聞
That's a big surprise.

1384
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:29,796
我有念書啊
What? l read.

1385
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:33,049
老公 學校不教曆險小說
Honey   they don't teach Tom Clancy at school.

1386
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,719
學校不教那個
Well   they don't.

1387
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:39,263
"土著"寫些什麼?
So   what is it? What is this Native Son? What is it?

1388
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:41,557
寫一個黑人的事
It's this book about this black guy.

1389
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:44,560
我們在上黑人文學專輯
We're doing this whole bIack literature unit.

1390
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:47,021
黑人曆史月啊?
What is it   Black History Month?

1391
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:48,606
不是...
No   it's just like...

1392
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:51,401
西尼決定的 讓我們學這個
This guy Sweeney   you know   it's part of the course now.

1393
01:39:58,409 --> 01:39:59,659
怎樣?
What?

1394
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:02,495
沒有 只是...
Nothing. It's just   you know.

1395
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,539
現在到處都是了
It's everywhere l look now.

1396
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:06,916
什麼?
What?

1397
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,878
都在搞"黑人認同運動"
This affirmative blaction.

1398
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:15,842
幾本書搞不了什麼運動
Honey   a few new books doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.

1399
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,761
念歸念 考歸考
Read the book   ace the guy's test.

1400
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:21,264
他說的別全都當真
Just don't swallow everything he feeds you whole.

1401
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,933
- 像新聞說的... - 什麼?
- Just because you see it on the news. - But like what?

1402
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:27,437
什麼一切平等 哪那麼簡單
All this stuff about making everything equal. It's not that simple.

1403
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:29,313
你現在念這本"土著"
Now you got this book   Native Son.

1404
01:40:29,481 --> 01:40:31,607
這門課其他的書呢?
What happened to the other books in the course?

1405
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:35,820
雙學位博士說其他書不好 就不必讀了?
They're not any good anymore because Mr. Two-Ph.D.s says they aren't?

1406
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:39,949
念黑人書 不念好書 合理嗎?
Are you gonna trade in great books for black books? Does that make sense?

1407
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:43,202
你得想想這個
You gotta question these things   Derek.

1408
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,371
你要看清真相
You gotta look at the whole picture.

1409
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,624
不只這個 我的工作也是
We're taIking about books here. But l'm also talking about my job.

1410
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:52,336
我隊上來兩個黑人...
I got two bIack guys on my squad now who got their job...

1411
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:56,132
...成績較好的白人被擠掉了
...over a couple of white guys who actually scored higher on the test.

1412
01:40:57,426 --> 01:41:01,137
這合理嗎? 是 一切都得平等...
That make sense? Huh? Yeah   sure   everything's equal now...

1413
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:05,558
...但我出勤時 這兩個比白人差的人...
...but l got two guys watching my back   responsible for my life...

1414
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:09,395
...要護衛我安全 因是黑人就得做這工作
...who aren't as good as two others. They got the job because they were black.

1415
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:12,356
- 不是能力強 - 好爛
- Not because they were the best. - That sucks.

1416
01:41:12,524 --> 01:41:14,442
美國就是這樣嗎?
Yeah. ls that what America is about?

1417
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,736
不 美國是"精英職場"
No. America's about "best man for the job."

1418
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:18,988
你能力強 才能有工作
You do your best   you get the job.

1419
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:22,450
這種鬼扯蛋的認同運動...
You know   this affirmative action crap...

1420
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,869
我不知道後面...
I don't know what that's about. There's some...

1421
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,663
...是不是有什麼陰謀
...hidden agenda or something going on.

1422
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:29,916
- 你懂嗎? - 我懂
- You see what l'm saying? - Yeah   I do.

1423
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:32,502
我沒那麼想過
I don't know   I didn't think about it like that.

1424
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:35,046
- 好的... - 但這個人...
- Well... - This guy   though...

1425
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:38,132
西尼真得很有說服力...
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney   he comes on   like   so strong...

1426
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,510
...很難不聽他說
...it's kind of hard not to listen to him.

1427
01:41:40,677 --> 01:41:42,637
也許他的話...
Maybe some of what he says is kind of...

1428
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:44,430
都是放屁
It's bullshit.

1429
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:46,849
對 也許
Yeah. Yeah   maybe.

不
No   no.

1431
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,270
是放黑屁
It's nigger bullshit.

1432
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,691
- 你懂了吧? - 我懂
- You see that   don't you? - Yeah.

1433
01:41:56,527 --> 01:42:00,530
- 你要小心 - 我懂 我會小心
- You gotta watch out for that. - Yeah   I get what you're saying. l will.

1434

快淩晨5:40了...
It's 5:40 a.m...

1437
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:18,084
...馬上我要去看日出
...and in about one minute   I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1438
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:20,628
我忘了有沒有看過日出
I don't know if I've ever done that.

1439
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:25,174
我們得打起精神 重新開始
Anyway   we're gonna try to pick things up and start over.

1440
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:28,302

我感覺很好
And I feel good.

1442
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,809
不知這報告你是否滿意
I'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted.

1443
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:38,771
有無提及你要的社會意義
If I hit the social significance   or whatever you're looking for.

1444
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:43,234
若還有一點價值 得謝謝你
But   for what it's worth   thanks a lot.

1445

Wow. You look great.

1446

1447
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:05,715
見假釋官得打扮一下
Yeah. Gotta dress up for the parole officer.

1448
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:07,633
是個俏妞?
Is she cute?

1449
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,386
是個胖男人
She is a fat guy named Hector.

1450
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,513
沒法僥幸了

- 算他走運 - 但有人會抓狂
- Then they got lucky. - Somebody's gotta lose   though.

Aw   what?

1480
01:47:32,237 --> 01:47:35,364
希望你去跟那幫人說說
We were kind of hoping that maybe you'd talk to your old crew.

1481
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:37,700
- 不行 - 暴力不好
- Come on. No way. - This is not a good thing.

1482
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,035
他們只可能聽你的
If there's anybody they'll listen to   it's you.

1483
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:42,455
不行 不瞞你說 我已經不玩了
No. No   l hate to tell you   but I'm out.

1484
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:44,665
可能他們倒想砍我
Those guys are probably gunning for me now.

1485
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:46,709
我們是請你幫忙
We're asking for your help here   Derek.

1486
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,336
- 你跟他建議的? - 德瑞
- Did you tell him l was gonna do this? - Derek.

1487
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,219
那跟我沒關系了
This has got nothing to do with me.

1488
01:47:57,387 --> 01:48:00,181
不 有關系 所有一切全都跟你有關系
Yes   it does. It has everything to do with you.

1489
01:48:00,348 --> 01:48:03,058
你在幹嘛? 我盡力了
What are you doing to me? You know   I'm doing my best.

1490
01:48:03,226 --> 01:48:05,728
我現在好好作人 不想連累家堣H
I'm going like this to keep my family in the cIear.

1491
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:08,355
- 別叫我去解決 - 我沒有
- Don't ask me to fix this. - I'm not asking that.

1492
01:48:08,523 --> 01:48:12,443
- 問題早就在了 - 你也有份 現在想逃避?
- It was there before me. - You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1493
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:14,862
你若逃避 就永遠不會平靜
You take a break   you'll find no peace.

1494
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:17,406
想要平靜只有去阻止
The way to find peace is to stick.

1495
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:20,576
不會有用的
It's not gonna make a fucking bit of difference.

1496
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,286
不一定
It might.

1497
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:26,081
你知道這是什麼要求嗎? 你真的知道?
Do you know what you're asking me to do? Do you really know?

1498
01:48:26,249 --> 01:48:29,335
我要你想方設法用你的影響力去阻止
Yes. l'm asking you to do whatever is in your power to do.

1499
01:48:32,422 --> 01:48:33,756
天啊
Man.

1500
01:48:35,717 --> 01:48:37,218

1501
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,766
好吧
All right.

1502
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:47,895
我會被白人槍殺
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1503
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,773
- 我想不會 - 好的...
- I doubt it. - Yeah   well...

1504
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:54,318
...那就夠諷刺了
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that   let me tell you.

1505
01:48:54,486 --> 01:48:57,738
我帶他去上學 半小時後回來
I'm gonna take him to school. I'll be back in haIf an hour.

1506
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,281

Come on.

1507
01:48:59,449 --> 01:49:02,743
嗨 東西寫了嗎?
Hey   you. You got something good for me this morning?

1508
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:06,455
- 會給你的 西尼博士 好嗎? - 好的
- I'll give it to you   Dr. Sweeney. All right? - Yeah   okay.

1509
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,294
怎麼了?
What's going on?

1510
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:19,260
快走
Come on.

1511
01:49:35,151 --> 01:49:38,153
我為塞斯好難過
This is so bad for Seth   man.

1512
01:49:38,321 --> 01:49:41,490
- 不知他們的傷重不重 - 不知道
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up. - I don't know.

1513
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:44,660
還好沒死 但我也不在乎
I'm gIad they're not dead   but other than that   I don't care.

1514
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:46,787
要去看他嗎?
Should we visit them?

1515
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:49,081
去看他們? 絕對不要
Visit them? No. No   definitely not.

1516
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,584
千萬別管這檔子事
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1517
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:53,544
你聽好...
listen   too...

1518
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:57,756
...昨天我離開塞斯那堮 看見有輛車徘徊
...l saw a car cruising by the house last night when l pulled out of there with Seth.

1519
01:49:57,924 --> 01:50:00,718
你回到家後 四周看看
If you get home before me   look around the street   all right?

1520
01:50:00,885 --> 01:50:02,845
確保一切沒事
Make sure there's nothing going on.

1521
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:06,140
天 真慘
Oh   man. This is bad.

1522
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,437
- 他們在找你 - 會沒事的
- They're after you   man. - It'll cool off.

1523
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,272
牢房都待過...
If l made it through Chino...

1524
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:17,026
...這小意思
...this should be a piece of cake   right?

1525
01:50:17,193 --> 01:50:20,362
- 你會好好的? - 會
- Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah   yeah.

1526
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:23,198
好的

1542
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:57,478
- 德瑞 不要! - 走開!

- All right. All right. - Get out of my way!

1544
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:01,315
讓他去!
Let him go!

1545
01:53:02,984 --> 01:53:07,029
噢 不 不 不!
Oh   no. No! No! No!

1546
01:53:07,363 --> 01:53:09,531
老天啊
Oh   Jesus.

1547
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,036
不
No.

1548
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:18,373
噢 不 不 不
Oh   no   no. No.

1549
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:34,640
天啊
Oh   Jesus.

1550
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,975
老天啊 我做了什麼?
God   what did I do?

1551
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:54,827
天啊
Oh   God.

1552
01:54:05,755 --> 01:54:08,382
我想這就是我學到的
So I guess this is where l tell you what l learned.

1553
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:10,926
我的結論
My conclusion   right?

1554
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:13,846
結論就是...
Well   my conclusion is...

1555
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:16,014
...憎恨是包袱
...hate is baggage.

1556
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:19,560
生命太短暫 不該老發脾氣
life's too short to be pissed off all the time.

1557
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:21,979
根本不值得
It's just not worth it.

1558
01:54:24,774 --> 01:54:27,901
德瑞說文章結尾要用名言
Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.

1559
01:54:28,403 --> 01:54:30,445
他說 最棒的話已有人說了...
He says someone else has already said it best...

1560
01:54:30,613 --> 01:54:35,117
...你超越不了他 就偷他的 來壯大自己
...so if you can't top it   steal from them and go out strong.

1561
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:37,953
所以我選了這段:
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1562
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,916
"我們不是敵人 而是朋友
"We are not enemies   but friends.

1563
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:45,502
不要當敵人
We must not be enemies.

1564
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,880
盡管會一時沖動...
Though passion may have strained...

1565
01:54:48,047 --> 01:54:51,300
...但切勿傷害我們的友愛
...it must not break our bonds of affection.

1566
01:54:51,467 --> 01:54:56,305
再相逢時 美好回憶會再度浮現...
The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched...

1567
01:54:56,472 --> 01:55:01,101
...讓他們以更好的角度 看待人類的本質"
...as surely they will be   by the better angels of our nature."
