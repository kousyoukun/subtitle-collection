The fact these people ripped off stores...

reflects that these people...

00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,875
"It's not a riot, it's rage.
It's not crime, it's poverty."

609
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:21,171
It's just nonsense. It's buIlshit.
It's exactly what happened in this trial too.

610
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,758
Because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops...

611
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:26,468
...whether they'd get convicted...

612
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:29,763
...and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

613
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,057
Everybody Iost sight
of Rodney King himseIf.

614
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:35,185
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

615
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:39,439
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
1 20 miles an hour down the highway.

616
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:43,360
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops,
and he attacks them.

617
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,112
He attacked police officers.
Bottom Iine. And he walked.

618
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,116
And there's some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through...

619
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:52,160
...so all we see is them hitting him.

620
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:56,373
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs...

621
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,084
...and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull.

622
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:01,586
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

623
00:43:01,754 --> 00:43:02,962
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

624
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,049
And those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves...

625
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:09,594
...for using absoluteIy standard,
textbook seIf-defense procedures.

626
00:43:09,762 --> 00:43:11,721
I don't think the tape showed that at aIl.

627
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,808
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?

628
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,143
Murray, what do you think?

629
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:22,732
I did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

630
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,236
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.

631
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:29,322
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

632
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,660
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those caIls...

633
00:43:33,828 --> 00:43:37,580
...because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous.

634
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,501
You know? Unfortunately,
very few people, Iike, respect that authority.

635
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:44,504
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.

636
00:43:44,672 --> 00:43:46,631
-What?
-Davina.

637
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:49,676
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You shouId Iearn to listen.

638
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:52,846
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

639
00:43:53,013 --> 00:43:56,349
I don't respect Iaws that let monkeys
like Rodney King on the street.

640
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,309
Second, l am not, as you well know...

641
00:43:58,477 --> 00:44:03,189
...a member of a low-rent, disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

642
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,692
Please. So take your head
out of your ass.

643
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,403
You've gotten off the point.

644
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:13,199
-I had a point. That wasn't the point.
-Do you have one? What is your point?

645
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,201
All right, think about this.

646
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:17,537
If Danny had been
walking across the street...

647
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:22,083
-...and Rodney King had plowed into him--
-Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

648
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:23,710
Mm-hm.

649
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:32,510
Who would like some dessert?

650
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:35,388
We're having a discussion.

651
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:37,807
We're having a nice discussion, right?

652
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,643
If Rodney King had been hopped up
on Chivas Regal and PCP...

653
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,896
...and killed Danny,
you'd sing a different tune.

654
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:45,607
I didn't see him hit anybody
and neither did you.

655
00:44:45,774 --> 00:44:47,525
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

656
00:44:47,693 --> 00:44:50,778
-Thank God.
-Keep it down, okay? AlIy's sleeping.

657
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:57,577
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over...

658
00:44:57,745 --> 00:45:00,663
...everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter.

659
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,541
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

660
00:45:03,709 --> 00:45:06,002
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.

661
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,048
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.

662
00:45:10,216 --> 00:45:11,424
I mean, it blows my mind.

663
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:13,593
We're hung up on this notion
we have some...

664
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:16,346
...obligation to help
the struggling black man.

665
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:20,099
Cut him some slack until he can overcome
these historical injustices.

666
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:22,685
It's crap. This stuff you guys
are saying perpetuates it.

667
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,229
All this liberal nonsense.

668
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:27,774
Everyone's looking the other way
while our country rots from inside out.

669
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:31,611
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves,
what, like, 1 30 years ago?

670
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:34,364
How long does it take
to get your act together?

671
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,450
Well, Jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years.

672
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:41,371
Are you saying that it's wrong
to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

673
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:45,792
STACEY: Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you alI the way, baby.

674
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,796
-I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
-Here we go again. l love this part.

675
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:52,882
Well, look at the way that they
scapegoated Chief Gates.

676
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,552
They'd come down that hard
on black Willie Williams?

677
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:59,097
-No way. The video was a setup.
-Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?

678
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:01,641
-Yes.
-No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.

679
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:04,644
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.

680
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:06,312
The hell do you think you are?

681
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,399
-She's in the middIe of a point.
-Who do you think you are?

682
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:10,692
-Sit down!
-No. Fuck you!

683
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,111
DEREK: Sit down! Shut up!
MURRAY: Derek, calm down.

684
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:14,612
-Sit down!
-Derek, calm down.

685
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,156
-Shut up!
-Don't tell him to shut up!

686
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:19,158
-Sit your ass down! No.
-Fuck you, move!

687
00:46:19,326 --> 00:46:21,578
-Sit down, shut up!
-Get out of my way! Move!

688
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:22,954
Goddamn it, Derek, move!

689
00:46:23,122 --> 00:46:25,248
Shut your mouth
and give my girlfriend respect.

690
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,667
Derek, what are you trying to prove?

691
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:31,504
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

692
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:35,550
-Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
DEREK: Come here!

693
00:46:35,718 --> 00:46:37,969
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina.

694
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:41,014
-Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
-Derek!

695
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:42,682
Stop!

696
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,892
She can't breathe!

697
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:47,145
DORIS:
Let her go!

698
00:46:47,313 --> 00:46:49,063
Are you gonna apologize?

699
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:51,399
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?

700
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:52,817
You're a fucking asshole.

701
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:55,528
I hate you!

702
00:47:04,246 --> 00:47:06,372
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.

703
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,043
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you...

704
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,630
...anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.

705
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,049
-That has nothing to do with it!
DEREK: lt doesn't?

706
00:47:16,216 --> 00:47:17,800
You don't think l see
what you're doing?

707
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:21,554
You think I'll sit here and smile while
some kike tries to fuck my mother?

708
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:23,598
It's never gonna happen!

709
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:26,768
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.

710
00:47:26,935 --> 00:47:30,063
I wilI fucking cut your ShyIock nose off
and stick it up your ass...

711
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,565
...before I let that happen.
Coming in here...

712
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:37,570
...and poisoning my family's dinner with
your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!

713
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,077
Fuck you!

714
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:46,037
Yeah, walk out.

715
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:48,331
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading
motherfucker!

716
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:50,041
Get the fuck out of my house!

717
00:47:55,214 --> 00:47:57,215
You see this?
That means "not welcome."

718
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:11,521
-What did l do?
-You disgust me!

719
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:13,856
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!

720
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,775
Primping your hair and your dress!

721
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:20,029
-Don't touch me! All tarted up!
-What did l do to you?

722
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,658
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?

723
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:24,951
Aren't you ashamed?

724
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,413
I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!

725
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:35,628
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!

726
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:43,803
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.

727
00:48:50,644 --> 00:48:52,311
I'm so sorry, Doris.

728
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:54,647
I really am.

729
00:49:02,448 --> 00:49:05,992
-He's gone.
-He's just a boy...

730
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,244
...without a father.

731
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:12,081
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

732
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:23,801
Goodbye.

733
00:50:09,014 --> 00:50:10,681
Hey. You all right?

734
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,312
-Take this, you fucking dick!
-Hey, no. No, no, come here!

735
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,647
-Fuck you!
-CaIm down!

736
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,023
-Let go of me!
-CaIm down!

737
00:50:19,191 --> 00:50:20,566
Let me go, goddamn it!

738
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:22,735
-Sorry. l'm sorry.
-Fuck you!

739
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,614
I would never hurt you. You know that.

740
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:28,825
Come on, l screwed up. l lost control.

741
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,409
It's not you.

742
00:50:30,577 --> 00:50:31,911
I'm sorry.

743
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,247
Come on, l'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.

744
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:36,374
You know that. I'd do anything for you.

745
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:37,750
I don't beIieve you.

746
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,002
I trust you, Derek.

747
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:43,339
[FRONT DOOR OPENS]

748
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,055
Hi.

749
00:50:51,223 --> 00:50:53,683
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?

750
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:55,768
-Want a plane ride?
-Yeah.

751
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:57,770
DANNY:
Going for takeoff.

752
00:50:59,314 --> 00:51:02,149
-Woo-hoo!
-Heh-heh-heh.

753
00:51:02,317 --> 00:51:03,401
Oh, no.

754
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:05,403
No, no! Don't crash!

755
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,114
Gotta go to Mom.

756
00:51:08,282 --> 00:51:10,116

01:47:42,422 --> 01:47:44,465
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1511
01:47:44,633 --> 01:47:46,509
We're asking for your help here, Derek.

1512
01:47:46,677 --> 01:47:49,136
-Did you tell him l was gonna do this?
-Derek.

1513
01:47:55,352 --> 01:47:57,019
This has got nothing to do with me.

1514
01:47:57,187 --> 01:47:59,981
Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

1515
01:48:00,148 --> 01:48:02,858
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

1516
01:48:03,026 --> 01:48:05,528
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the cIear.

1517
01:48:05,696 --> 01:48:08,155
-Don't ask me to fix this.
-I'm not asking that.

1518
01:48:08,323 --> 01:48:12,243
-It was there before me.
-You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1519
01:48:12,411 --> 01:48:14,662
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

1520
01:48:14,830 --> 01:48:17,206
The way to find peace is to stick.

1521
01:48:18,041 --> 01:48:20,376
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

1522
01:48:20,544 --> 01:48:22,086
It might.

1523
01:48:23,505 --> 01:48:25,881
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you?

1524
01:48:26,049 --> 01:48:29,135
Yes. l'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

-Yeah, well...

something good for me this morning?

-I'lI give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
-Yeah, okay.

What's going on?

This is so bad for Seth, man.

-I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
-I don't know.

1540
01:49:41,458 --> 01:49:44,460
I'm gIad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

1541
01:49:45,295 --> 01:49:46,587
Should we visit them?

1542
01:49:46,755 --> 01:49:48,881
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

1543
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:51,384
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

Listen, too...

1545
01:49:53,512 --> 01:49:57,556
...l saw a car cruising by the house last
night when l puIled out of there with Seth.

1546
01:49:57,724 --> 01:50:00,518
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

1547
01:50:00,685 --> 01:50:02,645
Make sure there's nothing going on.

Oh, man. This is bad.

-It'll cool off.

I don't know. l'll work it out. Hey.

Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

-Derek, no!
-Get out of my way!

-All right. All right.
-Get out of my way!

No.

Oh, no, no. No.

Oh, Jesus.

Oh, God.

DANNY: So I guess this is where
l tell you what l learned.

1581
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:10,726
My conclusion, right?

1582
01:54:11,561 --> 01:54:13,646
Well, my conclusion is...

1583
01:54:13,813 --> 01:54:15,814
...hate is baggage.

1584
01:54:16,066 --> 01:54:19,360
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1585
01:54:19,903 --> 01:54:21,779
It's just not worth it.

1586
01:54:24,574 --> 01:54:27,701
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1587
01:54:28,203 --> 01:54:30,245
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1588
01:54:30,413 --> 01:54:34,917
...so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.

1589
01:54:35,085 --> 01:54:37,753
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1590
01:54:39,339 --> 01:54:42,716
"We are not enemies, but friends.

1591
01:54:42,884 --> 01:54:45,302
We must not be enemies.

1592
01:54:45,470 --> 01:54:47,680
Though passion may have strained...

1593
01:54:47,847 --> 01:54:51,100
...it must not break
our bonds of affection.

1594
01:54:51,267 --> 01:54:56,105
The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched...

1595
01:54:56,272 --> 01:55:00,901
...as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature."
