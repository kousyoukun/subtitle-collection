1
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,075
Derek.

2
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,625
What the fuck are you thinking?

3
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,628
There's a black guy outside
breaking into your car.

4
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,005
How long's he been there?

5
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,423
I don't know.

6
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,758
What's going on?

7
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,177
Not right now, honey. How many?

8
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,512
Danny, how many?

9
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,804
One, I think.

10
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,848
Is he strapped?

11
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,266
Does he have a gun?

12
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,976
I don't fucking know.

13
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,147
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on?

14
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,525
Stay right here and be quiet.

15
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,069
Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

16
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,575
Stay right here.

17
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,262
I don't have a personal problem
with him.

18
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,431
Don't insult
my intelligence, Murray.

19
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,518
You hate this child,
and I think I know why.

20
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,442
Dr. Sweeney's office.

21
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,736
I went out with his mother
a few times.

22
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,947
That was three years ago.
It was nothing.

23
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,490
Nothing. Really?

24
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,743
That paper--
Bob, it's a travesty.

25
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,871
Arguing for Hitler
as a civil rights hero.

26
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,331
You've got to draw the line.

27
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,171
on any book that related to
the struggle for civil rights...

28
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,673
in plain English.

29
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,510
I am not disputing the fact
that the child is confused...

30
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,512
and harbors some sick ideas...

31
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,265
but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

32
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,017
His brother probably
put him up to it.

33
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,395
I guarantee you 100%%...

34
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,605
his brother did not
put him up to this.

35
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,691
I find that hard to believe.

36
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,442
I know he was a good kid...

37
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,195
and it's a shame what he's been
through, but that's dangerous.

38
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,030
Dangerous in what way?

39
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,866
That goes too far.

40
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,744
This racist propaganda,
"Mein Kampf" psychobabble...

41
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,081
he learned this nonsense,
and he can unlearn it, too.

42
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,917
I will not give up
on this child yet.

43
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,811
I knew it was you.

44
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,897
Danny, get in here.

45
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,191
I said get in here!

46
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,567
Get in here!

47
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,528
Five, four, three, two...

48
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,447
Shut the door!

49
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,868
What's it gonna be, Danny?

50
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,537
What's what gonna be?

51
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,748
This petty crap you're pulling.

52
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,376
I don't know.

53
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,920
Have a seat.

54
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,260
How are you doing?

55
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,181
Fine.

56
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,184
Things at home OK?

57
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,900
Derek got out this morning,
did he not?

58
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,946
Yeah, he did.

59
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,949
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

60
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,784
Honors English.

61
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,621
He was a brilliant student
like you...

62
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:03,210
but he hung out with fools,
also like you.

63
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,379
Did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

64
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,923
What happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

65
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:12,052
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

66
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,304
I followed directions.
I wrote an "A" Paper.

67
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,890
"Mein Kampf"?

68
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,893
I should expel you.

69
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,604
Go ahead. You don't
think I could handle it?

70
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,857
No. I think the street
would kill you.

71
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,942
Your rhetoric
and your propaganda...

72
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,111
aren't going to save you
out there.

73
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,822
So here's the drill.

74
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm your history teacher
from now on.

75
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,954
We will discuss current events.

76
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,291
We will call this class...

77
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,460
American History X.

78
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,463
We meet once a day.

79
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,841
All right.
Your first assignment...

80
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,343
is to prepare for me
a new paper due tomorrow.

81
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,055
Come on, Sweeney. It took me
a week to read "Mein Kampf."

82
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,942
What do you want me to do it on?

83
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,361
Your brother.

84
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,488
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

85
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,908
No. I'm not kidding.

86
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,494
I want you to analyze
and interpret all the events...

87
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,330
surrounding
Derek's incarceration.

88
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,125
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

89
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,378
concerning life
in contemporary America.

90
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,257
The impact on your life,
your family's.

91
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,387
Whatever you want to say, Danny.

92
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,976
I'll be the only one reading it.

93
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:49,274
But if it's not on my desk
tomorrow morning...

94
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,694
you are a ghost
at Venice Beach High.

95
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,364
You clear?

96
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,408
Yeah, I'm clear.

97
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,374
Telling teacher
I'm fuckin' cheatin'!

98
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,042
Is that what's happening?

99
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,878
I never cheated in my life.

100
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,421
Beat his mo'fuckin' ass.

101
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,714
I didn't say anything!

102
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,049
Why you trippin' on me?

103
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,680
Now why you all kicking it
like that?

104
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,598
What's up, man?

105
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,560
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

106
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,652
What's up?

107
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,364
Want some, too, bitch?
Punk, what's wrong with you?

108
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,824
You want to die?

109
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,202
Punk-ass white boy.

110
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,921
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

111
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,841
He don't wanna see me
and the heater.

112
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,844
Lucky the bell rung.

113
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,762
I would have clocked
that white boy.

114
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,599
Punk-ass motherfucker.
Should smoke that fool.

115
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,102
You gotta fucking stand up
for yourself.

116
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,870
We got a whole file
on skinheads here.

117
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,371
Part of the same gang?

118
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,581
Venice Beach gang.

119
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,084
Actually,
he's done a stretch at Y.A.

120
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,004
This guy C.C., is that him?

121
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,089
Yeah, that's him right there.

122
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,177
This morning we have a guest,
and there he is.

123
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,386
Good morning.

124
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,596
Morning, sir.

125
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,972
Good to see you.

126
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,182
Good morning.

127
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:47,267
This here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

128
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,770
He's principal
over at Venice Beach High.

129
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,231
For some time now,
he's been doing outreach work...

130
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,691
with gangs
both in and out of the can.

131
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,653
Three years ago, a local kid
named Derek Vinyard...

132
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,780
was sent up for murdering
a couple of Crips...

133
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,990
who were trying to jack his car.

134
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,661
Bob taught Vinyard, and
he's followed this case closely.

135
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,038
He was a skinhead, right?

136
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,582
He was more
like "the" skinhead...

137
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,793
the protégé
of Cameron Alexander.

138
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,420
-Who?
-Cameron Alexander.

139
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,465
Here you go. Have a look-see.

140
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:22,261
Cameron Alexander, well,
he's a Venice Beach landmark.

141
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,096
He's the biggest distributor
and writer...

142
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,598
of White Power literature
and videos in L.A. County.

143
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,726
He promotes White Power bands,
he writes reviews...

144
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,855
and in his spare time, this guy
even writes hate columns.

145
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,691
-Does he have a record?
-He's pretty clean.

146
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,360
Been trying to pin something
to him, but it doesn't work.

147
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:41,029
Trust me.
He's behind all of it.

148
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,824
He runs everything
out of his house by the beach.

149
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,493
There were no white gangs
in Venice Beach...

150
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,787
before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

151
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,748
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

152
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,668
Essentially,
he used Derek to recruit...

153
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,672
a slew of insecure, frustrated,
and impressionable kids.

154
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,800
This kid Vinyard,
he's got a lot of baggage...

155
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,804
as you'll see on this tape
we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

156
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,938
Earlier today, L.A. County
firefighter Dennis Vinyard...

157
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,608
was shot and killed
battling a blaze...

158
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,526
at a suspected Compton drug den.

159
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,403
We're at the Vinyard home now...

160
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,363
and Lieutenant Vinyard's
oldest son Derek...

161
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,490
has agreed to talk with us
for a moment.

162
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,911
Derek, if you could come
down here please for a second.

163
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:33,957
Look, I know this is tough,
but how do you feel right now?

164
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,460
How do you think I feel?

165
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:39,463
-I think it's typical.
-Typical how?

166
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:43,091
Well, this country's becoming
a haven for criminals...

167
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,593
so what do you expect?

168
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,803
Decent hard-working Americans
like my dad...

169
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,848
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

170
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,225
Parasites?

171
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:55,479
Blacks, browns, yellow,
whatever.

172
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,064
I don't understand.

173
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,107
You think maybe your father's
murder was race-related?

174
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,068
Yeah, it's race-related.

175
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,986
Every problem in this country
is race-related.

176
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,823
Not just crime.
It's immigration, AIDS, welfare.

177
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,034
Those are problems
of the black community...

178
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,869
the Hispanic community,
the Asian community.

179
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,287
They're not white problems.

180
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,748
Aren't those really issues
that deal more with poverty?

181
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,627
No. They're not products
of their environments.

182
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,504
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

183
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,841
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

184
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,552
Millions of white Europeans
came here and flourished...

185
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,970
within a generation.

186
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,389
What the fuck is the matter
with these people?

187
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,474
They have to go around
shooting at firemen.

188
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,477
What does this have to do
with the murder of your father?

189
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,938
Because my father was murdered
doing his job!

190
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,357
Putting out a fire in a fucking
nigger neighborhood...

191
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,192
he shouldn't
have given a shit about.

192
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,444
He got shot
by a fucking drug dealer...

193
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,947
who probably still collects
a welfare check.

194
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,908
Derek Vinyard was quietly
released from Chino...

195
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,245
early this morning after serving
three and some odd years.

196
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,039
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

197
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,666
If something happens to him...

198
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,669
things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

199
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,045
Just keep it low.

200
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,466
Venice Beach
didn't always look like this.

201
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,052
It used to be
a great neighborhood.

202
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,096
The boardwalk's always
been a dump...

203
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,307
but when my dad moved us
out here...

204
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,767
Venice was a nice,
quiet place to grow up.

205
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,397
Over the years, though,
it's just gone to hell.

206
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,399
The gangs are like a plague.

207
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,736
They moved west from Inglewood
and South Central...

208
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,154
and basically took over.

209
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,572
I ain't foulin' you!

210
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,207
I ain't got time
for all this bullshit.

211
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,625
Fuck y'all.

212
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,792
You all right?

213
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,002
I'm all right.

214
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,507
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

215
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,510
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.

216
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,142
Yeah, man, that's him.

217
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,237
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

218
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,405
That's why Derek started
the D.O.C.

219
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,575
He said white kids shouldn't
have to walk around scared...

220
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,078
in their own neighborhood,
and for a while there...

221
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,956
we really made it
like it was ours again.

222
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,583
Throw the ball!

223
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,252
Come on, Curtis!

224
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,212
Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

225
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,924
"D" up!

226
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,300
Come on, let's go.

227
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,886
Look at this
fucking jungle bunny.

228
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,722
He does a spin move every time.

229
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,142
You ain't gettin' shit,
motherfucker.

230
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,938
This one's for you, boy!

231
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,189
What the fuck you--

232
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,067
Who you callin' boy,
motherfucker?

233
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,318
You're lucky, motherfucker!

234
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,487
I'm through monkeying around
with your fucking ass!

235
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,156
Pale, pasty, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker.

236
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,284
A hundred bucks
say I make you my bitch.

237
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,289
Hear that?
He's trying to make ends meet...

238
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,249
for his cut in welfare.
You're on!

239
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,294
It's eight-six, Seth.

240
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,504
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

241
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,132
Come on. I can't cover this.
Help me out here.

242
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,508
You got a big fucking mouth.

243
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,635
I can take this niglet down.

244
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,180
You couldn't take a shit.
What are you thinking?

245
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,764
I will beat him.
Give me the money.

246
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:18,974
Shut up.

247
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,851
You're gonna
fucking embarrass us.

248
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,028
I'll take care of this.

249
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,030
Yo, I ain't got time for this.

250
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,198
Hey!

251
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,700
I got a bet.

252
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,829
I come in this game right now.
Same score...

253
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,373
but we play black guys
against the white guys.

254
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,714
Name your price, cracker.

255
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,133
No money. For these courts.

256
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,052
And not just today. For good.

257
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,179
If you win,
we will walk away...

258
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:01,099
but if we win,
no bitching, no fighting.

259
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,144
Right here in front of
everybody, pack up your shit...

260
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,188
and get your black asses
out of here.

261
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,898
Fuck that. Take this bet.

262
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,441
Eight to six. Our ball.

263
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,193
Let's go.

264
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,043
Pick him up!

265
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,135
Seth,
get back and play some "D."

266
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,444
Defense!

267
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,872
Pass the fucking ball!
I was wide open!

268
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,638
Bullshit.
That's fuckin' offence.

269
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,432
Get out of here.
He moved his feet.

270
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,476
You want to go, I'm ready!
Don't throw elbows at me!

271
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,896
You want to go, Adolf Hitler
wannabe motherfucker?

272
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,826
-You OK?
-Yeah. Give me some water.

273
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,953
You gotta call offence
on that shit.

274
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,788
Not on game point, Danny.

275
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,999
You can't let those niggers
get away with that shit.

276
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,209
It's game point.

277
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,960
Shut 'em down. Kick some ass.

278
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,338
Watch this.

279
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,184
Bye-bye.

280
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,061
Get the fuck off my court!

281
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,354
This is my house!

282
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,730
Fuck you, bitch!

283
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,703
Get the fuck out of here!

284
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,246
This is my court!

285
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,217
Derek wouldn't let us visit him
in prison.

286
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,970
He said it would make it
just too hard for him...

287
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,056
and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

288
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,893
Three years without him,
just wondering.

289
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,064
And then at 7:00 this morning...

290
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,734
we picked him up
outside the gate.

291
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:47,993
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

292
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,536
I wanted to stay home,
but he said...

293
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,246
"No. Go to school.
I'll see you later."

294
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,639
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

295
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,558
What? You too big
to give me a hug, tough guy?

296
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,644
No, man. I just know
you're gonna need someone...

297
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,562
to look after you while
you adjust to all this space.

298
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,813
Yeah, right.

299
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,609
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

300
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,319
How you doing? How's school?

301
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,946
It's good.

302
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,989
You gotta do something
about that hair.

303
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,491
That do's gotta go.

304
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,118
-The girls like it.
-Well, I don't.

305
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,580
You're keeping it pretty close.
You took it all the way down.

306
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,583
Shit. Look. I forgot, man.

307
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:40,087
It hurt like shit
when they put it on.

308
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,047
When'd you get that?

309
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,299
I got it about a month ago.

310
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,051
Cameron made it official.

311
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,723
He put this on you?

312
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:58,856
What?

313
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,358
Oh, hi. He's here.

314
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,026
Derek, it's for you.

315
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:05,445
Nothing.

316
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:08,323
Is there a phone in the back?
I'll get it in the back.

317
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:19,459
I got it. Yeah?

318
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:20,627
Oh, hey.

319
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,798
What?

320
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,342
My eyes have seen the glory...

321
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,428
of the trampling at the zoo.

322
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,472
We've washed ourselves
in nigger's blood...

323
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,017
and all the mongrels, too.

324
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,769
We're taking down
the Zog machine...

325
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,897
Jew by Jew by Jew.

326
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:43,901
The white man marches on.

327
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:46,904
You think our friend
was behind that?

328
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,948
I don't even care.

329
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,159
I'm gonna take care
of that tonight.

330
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:56,246
My sweet kids. My baby boy.

331
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,166
God, what's with
the love fest, you guys?

332
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:07,716
No. He'll do it.
I'll make sure he does it.

333
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:09,384
I'll get it.

334
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,935
I came to see the man.

335
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:21,271
-Can you fit through the door?
-Fuck you!

336
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,734
What's up, Dan? How you doing?

337
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,278
-Where's Derek?
-He's on the phone.

338
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,698
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Where the fuck are you?

339
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,035
Hang on. Give me a minute.

340
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,121
I'll be out in a minute.

341
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,054
I'll be careful.

342
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:57,850
I'm not gonna stay
in my room the rest of my life.

343
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,685
Hold on.

344
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:03,146
Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

345
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,023
Did you invite him over?

346
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,234
No. He always comes over here.

347
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,280
Danny, give me a minute.

348
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,490
Just give me one minute.

349
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,179
Are you still here, Goodyear?

350
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:39,516
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

351
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:44,021
When was the last time you were
actually able to see your feet?

352
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,317
Come in here, Danny.

353
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,532
Are you going to Cam's party
tonight?

354
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,868
Is Davina's ass watertight?

355
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,786
You're fucking sick, man.

356
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,831
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

357
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,125
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework.

358
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,003
Tell me some of the shit
you've learned, fuckass...

359
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:09,671
before I pistol-whip you.

360
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,799
OK. I believe in death,
destruction...

361
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,010
chaos, filth, and greed.

362
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:18,805
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I want to hear.

363
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,850
You mean that shit
about your mother?

364
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,728
You want to get
fucking beaten, Danny?

365
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,858
I'm not fucking talking to you.
Shut up.

366
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,611
Look, you gotta let me do this
my own way, all right?

367
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:36,031
I'll take care of it.

368
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,033
Who do you hate, Danny?

369
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:41,203
I hate anyone
that isn't white Protestant.

370
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:42,204
Why?

371
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,873
They're a burden to the
advancement of the white race.

372
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,208
Some are all right.

373
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,585
None of them
are fucking all right, OK?

374
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,839
They're all a bunch
of fucking freeloaders.

375
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,258
We don't know 'em.
We don't want to know 'em.

376
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,509
They're the fucking enemy.

377
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,721
What don't you like
about them...

378
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,682
and say it with
some fucking conviction.

379
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:04,935
I hate the fact it's cool
to be black these days.

380
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,103
Good.

381
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:10,232
I hate this hip-hop influence
on white fucking suburbia.

382
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:11,817
Good.

383
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:15,988
I hate Tabitha Soren and
her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...

384
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,614
telling us we should get along.

385
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,784
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

386
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,578
'cause it ain't gonna
fucking happen.

387
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,746
That's some of the best shit
I've ever heard.

388
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:28,417
I feel sorry for you, Danny.

389
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,586
You don't believe
any of that shit, right?

390
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:31,753
Shut up.

391
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:35,382
No. Get out of the house now,
you piece of shit.

392
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:38,135
Is that any way to talk
to a guest, a friend?

393
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,345
Derek hates you,
and you don't realize it.

394
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,931
How do you know who I hate?

395
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,310
Back from the dead.
God bless Jesus Christ.

396
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,770
God, I think you lost weight.

397
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,981
I can get my arms almost
all the way around you.

398
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:55,110
Fifty fuckin' pounds, man.
Look at this hair. Holy shit.

399
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:58,280
I told him it's gotta go.

400
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,449
Grab your jacket.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

401
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:04,620
I want to talk to him.
One second.

402
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:09,583
Hey, listen. Did you pull
some shit in school today?

403
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,794
-Just the usual.
-This kid is awesome as hell.

404
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,756
Did you turn in a paper
on "Mein Kampf"?

405
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:20,302
-Sweeney shit his pants.
-He did, man.

406
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:23,388
Was that your idea or
did Cameron put you up to that?

407
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,266
No. I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know?

408
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,477
It doesn't matter how I knew.

409
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,812
This kid is smart as hell.

410
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,856
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

411
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,775
Sweeney called and told me.

412
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,819
God, I hate
that fucking nigger, man.

413
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,321
He's gotta get a fucking life.

414
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,282
Sweeney's a good teacher.

415
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:44,493
Sweeney is a nigger
on a power trip.

416
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,578
That's what he was like
when we were there...

417
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,122
and that's how he is now.
It'll never change.

418
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,332
Fuck that nigger!

419
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,459
-Seth, go away.
-Are you kidding?

420
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:55,838
Nope. Wait in Danny's room.
I want to talk to my brother.

421
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,715
I've been here 15 minutes.
I'm starving.

422
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:06,807
Come here. Seriously, look.
Forget this yahoo.

423
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,768
He kills bugs for a living.
You don't want to be like that.

424
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,353
I'm serious. It's not funny.

425
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,730
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn a lot from him.

426
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:16,984
Don't go fuck it up
with small fry shit like that.

427
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,402
You don't understand.

428
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:20,529
You got to see the bullshit
paper he's making me write.

429
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,115
He told me all about it.
I don't care.

430
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,868
You do anything he tells you
to do. I mean it.

431
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,995
I don't want you getting
in trouble in school...

432
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:31,415
trying to impress me,
taking this shit in there.

433
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,208
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

434
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,962
Yeah, I guess, but, I mean,
I thought you'd be happy.

435
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,422
Well, I'm not.

436
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:42,259
Listen to that.

437
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:46,221
Yeah, I know.
It's been getting worse.

438
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:47,639
Don't worry about it.

439
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,600
I'll talk to you
about this later.

440
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:54,479
She's coughing her lungs out...

441
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,149
and you're blowing this
in her face all day.

442
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,400
I'm putting it out.

443
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:01,904
Hey, come on.
I want to talk to you.

444
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:09,286
Mommy, are you OK?

445
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,835
Put that out.

446
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:20,088
I was just yelling at him
for blowing smoke in your face.

447
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,341
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

448
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,178
You all right?

449
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,388
You all right?

450
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,022
Look, you got to take it easy.

451
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,982
You got to get some rest.

452
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,109
Take Danny's and my room,
and we'll hit the couch.

453
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,071
I've been on the couch for ages.
The couch is fine.

454
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,989
No, it's not fine.
This is terrible.

455
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:49,785
We can't live like this.
We gotta get out of here.

456
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,081
Can I go with you?

457
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:57,417
Yeah.
We all gotta get out of here.

458
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:00,963
-I could drop out and get a job.
-Absolutely not.

459
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,006
You got to finish.
I'll work something out.

460
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:11,431
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

461
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,267
Go wait in the living room.

462
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,603
I want him out of my house.

463
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:18,146
I know. Look.

464
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,373
He's an idiot.
He's always been an idiot.

465
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,084
He can't help it.
I got to do that paper.

466
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,461
I'll catch up with you
later tonight.

467
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:44,631
Not at Cameron's. I need you
to stay away from there.

468
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:48,135
-We were going to hang.
-I'll explain it later.

469
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,637
I just need you to stay away
from the party, all right?

470
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:51,805
Whatever.

471
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:55,434
Promise me you'll stay away
from that party tonight.

472
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,728
I'm not fucking 14 anymore,
all right?

473
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,230
Whatever.

474
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,192
God!

475
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,033
Come on, let's go.

476
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:13,952
Where are you parked?

477
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,245
Out back.

478
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,983
Yeah, that's the whole bunch.

479
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:30,320
It didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself...

480
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,447
and Cameron knew
just how to use it.

481
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,824
You don't want to stick around?

482
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:37,953
You know I'd love to,
but I got to be careful.

483
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,997
Yeah, I know.

484
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,541
I'll see you back at the house.

485
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,335
Good luck.

486
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:49,298
He sent Derek to the kids,
to the frustrated ones...

487
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,175
the ones who were sick
of getting their asses kicked...

488
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:53,635
by black and Mexican gangs.

489
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:56,513
"Don't just be some punk.
Be part of something."

490
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:59,433
All right, let's go.
Pull it together.

491
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:01,143
And everybody ate it up.

492
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,604
They did whatever Derek
told them to.

493
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,899
Let's go. We're not here
to fucking socialize.

494
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:09,943
Shut the fuck up.

495
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,195
Yeah, man.

496
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,571
You want a little toke?

497
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,449
Go ahead.

498
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:18,076
-Curtis, what is that?
-Come on, Derek.

499
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,871
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

500
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,164
Jesus fucking Christ.

501
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,624
Have a little self-respect.

502
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:29,046
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

503
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,966
There's over two million
illegal immigrants...

504
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,511
bedding down
in this state tonight.

505
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,516
This state spent three
billion dollars last year...

506
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:43,894
on services for those people
who had no right to be here.

507
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:45,521
Three billion dollars.

508
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:50,067
$400 million just to lock up
illegal immigrant criminals...

509
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:53,904
who only got into this country
because the INS decided...

510
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:57,950
it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

511
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:02,412
Our government
doesn't give a shit.

512
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:08,252
Our border policy is a joke,
so is anybody surprised...

513
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:10,587
that south of the border
they're laughing at us?

514
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,881
Laughing at our laws?

515
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:14,716
Every night, thousands
of these parasites...

516
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:17,636
stream across the border like
some fucking piñata exploded.

517
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:21,306
Don't laugh.
There's nothing funny here.

518
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,392
This is about your life
and mine.

519
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,895
It's about decent,
hard-working Americans...

520
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,772
falling through the cracks
and getting the shaft...

521
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:32,276
because their government
cares more about the rights...

522
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:34,570
of a bunch of people
who aren't even citizens.

523
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,655
On the Statue of Liberty
it says...

524
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:39,408
"Give me your tired,
your hungry, your poor."

525
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,077
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

526
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,288
Until you take care of that...

527
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:47,332
close the fucking book,
because we're losing.

528
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:51,879
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

529
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,340
We're losing our freedom so
a bunch of fucking foreigners...

530
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,551
can come in here
and exploit our country.

531
00:36:57,593 --> 00:37:00,679
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

532
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,765
This isn't happening places
we can't do anything about it.

533
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,268
It's happening here.
Right in our neighborhood.

534
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,395
Right in that building
behind you.

535
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:11,899
Archie Miller ran that grocery
store since we were kids here.

536
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,818
Dave worked there.
Mike worked there.

537
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,196
He went under, and now
some fucking Korean owns it...

538
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,740
who fired these guys
and is making a killing...

539
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:23,118
because he hired
40 fucking border jumpers.

540
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,536
I see this shit going on...

541
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,580
and I don't see anybody
doing anything about it...

542
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,499
and it fucking pisses me off.

543
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,628
So look around you.

544
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,005
This isn't
our fucking neighborhood.

545
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,799
It's a battlefield.
We're on a battlefield tonight.

546
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,510
Make a decision.

547
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:42,221
Are we going to stand
on the sidelines?

548
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,932
Quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

549
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:48,852
Are we going to ante up
and do something about it?

550
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,688
You're goddamn right.

551
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,954
Come here!
Don't you know it's illegal...

552
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,623
to hire fucking border jumpers,
you nip bastard?

553
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:18,841
Hey, sweetheart.

554
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:21,051
No. You don't need this.
We're not going to hurt you.

555
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:22,678
Please, please! No!

556
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,849
You fucking spic!

557
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:32,437
-No! Please!
-This bitch deserves it.

558
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:36,733
This bitch stinks. Smells like
fish and chips and guacamole.

559
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,235
Here we go.

560
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,998
Goddamn!

561
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,712
Get the fuck off me,
motherfucker!

562
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,596
Viva la Mexico!

563
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,436
Have a fucking bean,
you fucking beaner!

564
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,405
Get some of that in there.
Throw it on.

565
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,324
That's a great color on you.

566
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,284
Now you can get
a white woman's job.

567
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,328
A little better
than this one, huh?

568
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,954
Yeah, white.

569
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,831
Then you'll move up
in the world.

570
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,834
Asshole!

571
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:38,921
Let's go!

572
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,547
Everybody out!

573
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:42,090
Now! Now!

574
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,929
All right, let's go!

575
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,430
Come on!

576
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:50,057
Come on, let's go.

577
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:58,565
No green card, no fucking work.
Comprende?

578
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:02,110
Come on!

579
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,154
We're fucking going! Come on!

580
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:34,434
Dad was gone, but things
were almost normal again.

581
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,186
Derek had a good job.

582
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:37,980
Mom was starting
to live a little.

583
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:42,317
Everyone was feeling so good,
we just didn't see it coming.

584
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,069
Maybe we should've.

585
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,405
The irony is
that most of the stores...

586
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:49,032
destroyed during the riots
were owned by black people.

587
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:52,161
That's stupid, though.
Why trash your own neighborhood?

588
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:55,205
Well, that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

589
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:57,332
It's like an expression
of rage...

590
00:40:57,374 --> 00:41:01,336
by people who feel neglected
and turned away by the system.

591
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:06,925
It's like we had in Watts
or the riots in Chicago in '68.

592
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,510
I don't buy that.

593
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:11,013
Calling a riot an irrational
expression of rage.

594
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,932
That's such a cop-out.
It's opportunism at its worst.

595
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:16,185
It's people grabbing
any excuse they can find...

596
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:18,061
to go and loot a store,
nothing more.

597
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:20,397
The fact that these people
ripped off the stores...

598
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:22,399
in their own communities,
all that reflects...

599
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,402
is that they have no respect
for the law at all...

600
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:28,030
and certainly no concept
of community...

601
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,740
or civic responsibility.

602
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:30,949
Now wait a minute.

603
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:33,535
White people commit crimes
against white people, too.

604
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:37,039
Yeah, but they're not offing
each other in record numbers.

605
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,041
Look at the statistics,
for Christ's sake.

606
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,210
One in every three
black males...

607
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,587
is in some phase
of the correctional system.

608
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:44,880
Is that a coincidence...

609
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:47,758
or do these people have
a racial commitment to crime?

610
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:50,093
Not only that.
They're proud of it.

611
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:52,262
Maybe it says something
about prejudice...

612
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:53,472
in the judicial system.

613
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:55,766
If you want to talk
about criminal statistics...

614
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:59,311
take a look at the social
inequalities that produce them.

615
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:01,396
That's exactly what I hate.

616
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:04,525
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

617
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:06,944
and just alleviating
the responsibility...

618
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:08,570
these people have
for their own actions.

619
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,990
It's like saying,
it's not a riot, it's rage.

620
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:15,577
It's not crime, it's poverty.
That's just nonsense.

621
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,538
It's exactly what happened
in this trial...

622
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,331
because the media
twisted things around...

623
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,042
so people got all focused
on these cops...

624
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:23,418
and whether or not they were
going to get convicted...

625
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,588
and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

626
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,841
Everybody lost sight
of old Rodney King himself.

627
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:31,969
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

628
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,846
He's high as a goddamn kite...

629
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:36,557
driving 120 miles an hour
down the highway.

630
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:38,600
He gets pulled over
by a bunch of cops...

631
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:40,102
and he attacks them.

632
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,436
He attacked police officers.

633
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:42,980
That's the bottom line,
and he walked.

634
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,315
And there's some yahoo there
with a video camera...

635
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,733
who turned it on
halfway through...

636
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:49,111
so that all we see
is them hitting him.

637
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:52,781
You got Powell and Koon
cracking him with billy clubs...

638
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:55,075
and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull...

639
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,493
so it looks severe, you know?

640
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:57,828
People are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

641
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,872
This poor guy
who attacked four cops...

642
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,748
and those cops
end up on the stand...

643
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,378
defending themselves for using
standard textbook procedures.

644
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,505
I don't think the tapes
showed that at all.

645
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:11,633
You didn't think so?
And you're an authority?

646
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:13,969
Murray, what do you think?

647
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:19,600
I did think the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

648
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,310
Who are you
to say what's excessive?

649
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:23,020
I think it was
totally appropriate.

650
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:26,148
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

651
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,985
We, as society, grant cops
a certain amount of authority...

652
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:32,196
to make those calls,
because we acknowledge...

653
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:34,448
that their job is difficult
and dangerous.

654
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:38,368
Very few people respect that
and respect that authority.

655
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,288
Look who's talking about
respect--Mr. Junior KKK.

656
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,498
What?

657
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,502
You want to go to college?
Learn to listen.

658
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,838
I didn't say I respect the laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

659
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,425
I don't respect laws that let
Rodney King back on the street.

660
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:56,762
Second, I am not a member
of a low-rent...

661
00:43:56,803 --> 00:44:00,933
disorganized bunch of rednecks
like the fucking KKK. Please.

662
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:03,727
So take your head
out of your ass.

663
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:05,562
You've gotten off the point.

664
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:08,190
I had a point.
That wasn't even the point.

665
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,150
Do you have one?
What is your point?

666
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:11,944
All right, think about this.

667
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,488
If Danny was walking
across the street that night...

668
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,739
and Rodney King
plowed into him--

669
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:17,866
Can we drop
this Rodney King thing?

670
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,294
Who would like some dessert?

671
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:32,214
We're having a discussion.

672
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,591
We're having
a nice discussion, right?

673
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:36,093
If Rodney King
had been driving along...

674
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:38,136
hopped up on PCP
and had killed Danny...

675
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,638
you'd be singing
a different tune--

676
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,641
I didn't see him hit anybody,
and neither did you.

677
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:45,310
He didn't happen
to kill anybody, thank God.

678
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,855
Keep it down, OK?
Ally's sleeping.

679
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:54,403
If that fucking monkey
had run some kid over...

680
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:57,656
everybody would have
a very different opinion.

681
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:00,909
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

682
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,953
But instead,
he just attacked a few cops...

683
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:04,746
so, suddenly,
it's Hands Across America...

684
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,832
for this fucking total
son of a bitch.

685
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:08,292
It blows my mind.

686
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:11,170
We're so hung up on this notion
that we have some obligation...

687
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,255
to help
this struggling black man.

688
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:15,591
Cut him some slack
until he can overcome...

689
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:16,967
these historical injustices.

690
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:19,469
It's crap. This stuff
just perpetuates it...

691
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,013
all this liberal nonsense.

692
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:22,514
Everyone's looking
the other way...

693
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:24,600
while our country rots
from the inside out.

694
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:28,228
I mean, Christ, Lincoln freed
the slaves 130 years ago.

695
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,314
How long does it take
to get your act together?

696
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:34,401
Jews have been persecuted
for over 5,000 years.

697
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,820
Are you saying it's wrong
to feel sensitive...

698
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,155
about anti-Semitism?

699
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:39,531
Oh, forget that.

700
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:42,618
I'm with you. I'm with you
all the way, baby.

701
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,453
I'm so sick of
these liberal hypocrites.

702
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:46,622
Here we go again.
I love this part.

703
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:47,706
This is great.

704
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:49,666
Look how they scapegoated
Chief Gates.

705
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,336
Think they would've come down
that hard on Willie Williams?

706
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:55,756
No way. That videotape was
a set-up to get rid of Gates.

707
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:59,134
-Can I be excused?
-No. Don't interrupt.

708
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:01,470
Excuse me. I was talking.
I listened to you.

709
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:05,182
-Who do you think you are?
-She's making a point.

710
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:07,476
Davina, sit down.

711
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:10,812
Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!

712
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:14,149
-Derek, calm down.
-Don't tell him to shut up!

713
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:17,069
Sit your ass down. No.
Sit down. Shut your mouth.

714
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,738
Move! Goddamn it! Move!

715
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,032
Shut your mouth and give
my girlfriend respect.

716
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:24,493
Derek, what are you
trying to prove?

717
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:26,161
Murray, stay out of it!

718
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:28,330
Where do you think you're going?

719
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:31,208
Derek, let her go!

720
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,753
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina!

721
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,172
Shut your fucking mouth!

722
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:38,382
Stop!

723
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,801
She can't breathe!

724
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:43,846
Let her go!

725
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,931
You going to apologize?

726
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:51,103
You're a fucking asshole.
I hate you!

727
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,198
What are you doing?
This is your family.

728
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,200
Right.
My family, so you know what?

729
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:08,579
I don't give two shits about you
or what you think.

730
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,414
You're not a part of it.

731
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,875
-That has nothing to do with it.
-It doesn't?

732
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,710
You don't think
I see what you're doing?

733
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:16,336
You think
I'll sit here and smile...

734
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:18,881
while some fucking kike
tries to fuck my mother?

735
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:21,842
It's never going to happen.
Fucking forget it.

736
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:23,719
Not while I'm in this family.

737
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,804
I will fucking cut
your Shylock nose off...

738
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:28,557
and stick it up your ass
before I let that happen.

739
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:31,101
Coming in here and poisoning
my family's dinner...

740
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:34,396
with your Jewish,
nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.

741
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:40,903
Fuck you. Fuck you.

742
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,738
Yeah, walk out.

743
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,282
Asshole. Fucking
cabala-reading motherfucker.

744
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:46,867
Get out of my house.

745
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:54,082
You see this?
That means not welcome.

746
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,846
What did I do?

747
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,890
You disgust me.

748
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:12,601
Bring him to our table, primping
your hair and your dress.

749
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,811
What did I do?

750
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:16,814
You're all tarted up.

751
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:18,565
How could you bring him
to my father's table?

752
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,777
How could you go from Dad
to that? Aren't you ashamed?

753
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:25,239
I'm ashamed that you
came out of my body!

754
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:31,578
Go run to your fucking kike!
Run to him !

755
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:40,629
It's OK.
I'm proud of you, baby.

756
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:50,931
I'm so sorry, Doris.
I really am.

757
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:00,315
He's gone.

758
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:05,154
He's just a boy
without a father.

759
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:08,907
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

760
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,419
Good-bye.

761
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:07,466
Hey, you all right?

762
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:13,096
-Take this, you fucking dick!
-No. Come here.

763
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:14,723
-Fuck you!
-Calm down.

764
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,099
-Let go of me!
-Calm down.

765
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:17,392
Let me go, God damn it!

766
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:19,645
-Fuck you!
-I'm sorry.

767
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,607
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

768
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:27,236
I screwed up. I lost control.
It's not you.

769
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:30,447
I'm sorry.
I'd never hurt you guys.

770
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:33,158
You know that.
I'd do anything for you.

771
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,535
I don't believe you.

772
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,912
I trust you, Derek.

773
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:51,343
What are you doing out of bed?
Want a plane ride?

774
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,304
-Yeah.
-Going for takeoff.

775
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:01,895
Oh, no, don't crash.

776
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,942
Better go to Mom.
She's a crazy flier.

777
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:09,987
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

778
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,915
-You don't feel too hot.
-No. It's my chest.

779
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:24,459
-What are you up to?
-I'm just thinking.

780
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:27,004
Yeah? There's a lot of that
going around.

781
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:29,882
I don't even know
how we got here sometimes.

782
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:32,676
I feel like I let you down, only
I didn't know when it happened.

783
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:34,428
Mom, it's OK.

784
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,350
It's cold in here.
No wonder you're sick.

785
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:43,061
You don't get sick from cold.
You get sick from germs.

786
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,856
No. You get sick from smoking.

787
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:50,569
You ought to quit.
It's not good for you.

788
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,327
What are you looking at me
like that for?

789
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:01,079
When are you going to let
that beautiful hair grow back?

790
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:04,958
The day you quit smoking.

791
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:09,546
Deal.

792
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:14,343
I'd better get Ally to bed.
You say good night to Mom?

793
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,512
Then you have to go to bed.
Come on.

794
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:19,056
-Good night, Mama.
-Good night, baby.

795
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:56,969
I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

796
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,304
I try to stop it from happening.

797
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,223
I want you out of this house.

798
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:03,225
That's fine.
I'll be gone in the morning.

799
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:05,894
He can move in with me.

800
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,523
In my mind, I imagine
what would've happened...

801
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:12,943
if I hadn't gone to that room
and told him.

802
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,487
Get down!

803
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:18,198
No, Derek!

804
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:22,244
Help, Mommy!

805
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:39,511
Nigger, you just fucked
with the wrong bull. Come here!

806
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:40,637
Damn!

807
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:44,141
Should've learned your place on
the fucking basketball court...

808
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:45,893
but you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

809
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,897
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

810
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:53,609
You ever shoot at firemen?
You shoot at my family?

811
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,028
I'm going to teach you a real
lesson now, motherfucker.

812
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,280
Put your fucking mouth
on the curb.

813
00:53:58,322 --> 00:53:59,323
Hold on, man.

814
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:02,284
Put it on the curb right now!

815
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:06,663
That's it.

816
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:08,457
Derek, no!

817
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,505
Now say good night.

818
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:28,310
Fucker.

819
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:37,945
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

820
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:39,988
Put your hands up!

821
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:43,492
I said get your hands up!
Now turn around!

822
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:55,170
Put your hands behind your head!

823
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:00,884
Get down on your knees
right now!

824
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:02,446
It's all right.

825
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:05,532
Let's go.

826
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:10,329
-Come on.
-No.

827
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:19,379
She ain't gonna open the door?

828
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:22,007
Someone right fucking there
looking at us. Hello?

829
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,675
Danny, it's for you.

830
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:26,512
Be right there.

831
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:42,694
Open the door, Danny.
It's fucking freezing!

832
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:44,738
Danny, I'm gonna be sick!

833
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,783
Come on, Danny!

834
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:19,731
I'm gonna go get some beers.

835
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,997
Hey, what a party, fatso?

836
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:38,834
I'm not fat, asshole!
I'm husky!

837
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:40,878
What the fuck's up, Seth?

838
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:43,172
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

839
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:44,423
Holy fuck, he's here!

840
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,718
Yeah, he's fucking here.
Go pay your respects.

841
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:48,760
Fuck you, Seth!

842
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:53,849
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

843
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:55,684
-Father Vinyard?
-How's it going?

844
00:57:55,726 --> 00:57:58,520
I'm Jason, this is Chris.
We're friends with your brother.

845
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:01,273
You are a fucking god, man!

846
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,335
I thought you turned
that paper in.

847
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:24,171
I did. Now fucking Murray
turned me in...

848
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:27,424
so Sweeney's making me
write another one.

849
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:32,304
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying.

850
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:35,307
He's one of those
"proud to be nigger" people.

851
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:36,767
I hate those guys.

852
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:39,978
Wait a minute, Danny.
He's not proud.

853
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:45,484
No. He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

854
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:48,737
He's making you feel guilty
about writing on Adolf Hitler.

855
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:53,909
Some nigger, some spic writes
about Martin Luther King...

856
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:58,455
or fucking Cesar commie Chavez
gets a pat on the head.

857
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:00,582
Yeah.

858
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:04,461
You can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

859
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:05,504
Definitely.

860
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,510
Come on, let's go.

861
00:59:11,552 --> 00:59:14,388
No. Listen. Wait.

862
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,390
I want to see you, OK?

863
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,434
I do, but I gotta
take care of something tonight.

864
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:23,981
-OK.
-You understand?

865
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:27,359
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

866
00:59:31,155 --> 00:59:33,740
-Would you do something with me?
-Anything.

867
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,742
Leave with me.

868
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:38,328
Leave where?

869
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:42,291
Leave here. Leave all this.
Just come with me.

870
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:44,293
Why would you want to leave?

871
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:45,961
They worship you.
You're like a god to them.

872
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:49,464
If we had it good before, wait
till you see what it's like now.

873
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:53,135
I don't want all that.
I don't want my family involved.

874
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,721
Everything I've done here
fucked it all up, understand?

875
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:57,806
You think what you did
was wrong?

876
00:59:57,848 --> 01:00:00,684
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

877
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:03,270
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

878
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:05,647
and we all know that.

879
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,817
I understand you just got out,
but no one's gonna hurt you.

880
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:11,320
No one can touch you.
There's a small army out there.

881
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,947
We're not gonna let
a bunch of spooks kick us out.

882
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,283
You're not listening to me.
I'm not scared.

883
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:18,535
I don't want it anymore.

884
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:22,206
I'm done with it.
I'm through with this.

885
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:27,127
It's bullshit, Stacey.

886
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:30,255
You don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

887
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:34,051
If you want to be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

888
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:35,344
Come on.

889
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,847
You're nuts. You are nuts.
No way.

890
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,934
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

891
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:45,771
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

892
01:00:45,813 --> 01:00:48,357
It is like nothing
you have ever seen.

893
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:50,234
This was a mistake. Forget it.

894
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,694
Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

895
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,947
Stacey, just say good-bye.

896
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,908
This isn't you. I know you.

897
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,868
You don't know anything
about me, Stacey.

898
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:10,087
-Are you Danny's brother?
-Yeah.

899
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:13,131
Will you tell him
Lizzy's looking for him?

900
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:15,133
Thank you.

901
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:20,722
We'll let the niggers, kikes,
and spics grab for the pie.

902
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,933
Can't blame 'em.

903
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:25,477
Course, they're gonna
have to fight to get it.

904
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:30,065
And if we scare
the fuck out of people...

905
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:34,111
and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

906
01:01:34,153 --> 01:01:36,822
Gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

907
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,575
Hey, man.

908
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:43,954
Well, look who's here.
The return of the soldier.

909
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:45,998
What are you doing here, Danny?

910
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,126
Come on, man.
I had to check it out.

911
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:50,419
You knew I was gonna come.

912
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:54,423
Let the kid alone, Derek.
He knows when to go to bed.

913
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:57,593
Go wait outside.

914
01:01:57,634 --> 01:01:59,928
Come on, Der.
I'm not doing anything.

915
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:03,390
This little blonde girl
keeps asking for you.

916
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:05,225
She's dying. Come on.

917
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:07,686
-I gotta check out.
-Go easy on her.

918
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:09,730
All right.

919
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:15,194
Wait for me right outside.

920
01:02:20,032 --> 01:02:22,201
Take it easy.

921
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:24,661
Chill out.

922
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:27,122
You're on safe ground.

923
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:29,875
You don't have to watch
your ass around here.

924
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:33,295
Come on. Sit down. Relax.

925
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:38,133
I'm sorry.
The party was a little quick...

926
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:41,428
but we're just so damn glad
you're back, Derek.

927
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,514
It's only natural
you should feel a little funny.

928
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,015
I don't feel funny, Cam.

929
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:47,810
You made the fat kid
a little nervous.

930
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,853
He thinks the joint
messed with your mind.

931
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:51,355
It did.

932
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:02,533
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

933
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:07,246
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

934
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:10,624
The white man marches on!

935
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:13,836
Things have changed
since you've been gone.

936
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:16,046
You talk about organization?

937
01:03:16,088 --> 01:03:19,007
Wait'll you see what
we've done with the internet.

938
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:21,009
We've got every gang
from Seattle to San Diego...

939
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:22,636
working together now.

940
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:25,138
Not competing anymore.
They're consolidated.

941
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:27,599
Only thing we lack is
a little overall leadership.

942
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:30,811
That's where you come in.

943
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:33,897
Those people out there got
a lot of respect for you.

944
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:36,191
When you're ready,
come talk to me about it.

945
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:39,987
You can forget about that.
I'm done with it, Cam.

946
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:43,657
Yeah, well,
I know you grew out of...

947
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:47,202
that shaved head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

948
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:48,996
I like your hair
the way it is now.

949
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:52,040
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

950
01:03:52,082 --> 01:03:53,834
No more of this fucking
grocery store--

951
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:55,752
You're not listening to me.
I am done with it.

952
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:58,046
All that bullshit out there
and all your bullshit, too.

953
01:03:58,088 --> 01:03:59,756
I'm out.

954
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:02,926
I understand how you feel.
You've just done hard time.

955
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:05,095
Don't you fucking talk to me
about hard time.

956
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,306
-You don't know anything.
-I've done mine.

957
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:09,766
You didn't do shit.
I found out about you.

958
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:11,768
You did two months,
then rolled over on two kids...

959
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:13,729
and let them go down for you.

960
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,731
So don't feed me
your fucking lies, Cameron.

961
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:20,944
All right. This is stupid.
I'm done.

962
01:04:20,986 --> 01:04:23,655
You go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

963
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:26,533
Get your head on straight,
and then I'll talk to you.

964
01:04:26,575 --> 01:04:28,660
But it doesn't matter
if I don't, does it?

965
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,662
'Cause you got the next crop...

966
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:32,498
lined up and ready to go,
you fucking chicken hawk.

967
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:34,416
Excuse me?

968
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:37,085
You prey on people, Cam !
You use them !

969
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:40,214
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause...

970
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:42,007
but I am on to you now,
you fucking snake.

971
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:46,136
Derek, watch it. Be careful.
Remember where you are.

972
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:49,848
This isn't some fucking country
club you can waltz in and out--

973
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,683
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

974
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:54,645
I came here to tell you
one thing. I am out.

975
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:56,563
Out! And Danny is out, too!

976
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:58,857
If you come near my family,
I'll fucking kill you.

977
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:01,360
Excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

978
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:03,695
You can't come
barking threats at me.

979
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:06,615
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

980
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:08,992
He's not some whiny pussy
like you.

981
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:10,994
He needs my help,
and I'm gonna give it to him.

982
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:13,497
If you come near Danny again...

983
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:15,707
I will feed you
your fucking heart, Cameron.

984
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:21,588
I won't have to.
He'll come to me.

985
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,799
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

986
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,304
Shit.

987
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:32,307
You're a fucking dead man,
Vinyard.

988
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:51,160
Hey, where's Cameron?
Where the fuck is he?

989
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:55,998
Stay away from me, Stacey.
Danny!

990
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,000
Why don't you share
with the rest of us...

991
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:01,587
what you just said to me,
you piece of shit nigger!

992
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:03,839
You monkey-fucking traitor!

993
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,632
You a fucking nigger-fucker?

994
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:07,634
Hey, Danny! Come on!

995
01:06:07,676 --> 01:06:10,137
He's a fucking nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!

996
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,140
Cam's out cold!
Where the fuck are you going?

997
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,142
Gun! He's got a gun!

998
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:17,519
Shit! Back up!

999
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:21,023
You make me fucking sick!

1000
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,901
Put down the fucking gun!

1001
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:25,152
Shoot the nigger!

1002
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:29,031
Shoot him !
Do it, Seth! Shoot him !

1003
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,283
Traitor!

1004
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:32,701
Do it, Seth! Do it!

1005
01:06:35,871 --> 01:06:37,664
Back up! Move!

1006
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:42,044
Back up! Back the fuck up!

1007
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:44,505
Move! Move!

1008
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:45,839
Easy, Derek! Hey!

1009
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:08,487
Easy, Danny!

1010
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:10,572
Who do you think you are?

1011
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:13,617
-Danny, relax.
-Who do you think you are?

1012
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:15,953
Take it easy, Dan.

1013
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:18,080
I fucking hate you, Der!

1014
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:20,123
All right. I mean it.

1015
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:21,625
Huh?

1016
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:24,253
Come on. Shut up.
Take it easy.

1017
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:26,255
What's happened to you, Der?

1018
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:28,674
Take it easy.

1019
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:31,051
What's happened to you, Der?

1020
01:07:39,143 --> 01:07:41,812
Come on. Come on.

1021
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:47,109
It's just so fucked.

1022
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:50,154
I'm sorry. You weren't
supposed to see that.

1023
01:07:50,154 --> 01:07:51,405
I told you not to come.

1024
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:54,074
Fuck you, man.

1025
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:55,659
That was so fucked up.

1026
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:58,287
I know, I know.

1027
01:07:58,328 --> 01:08:00,956
God, it wasn't supposed
to happen that way.

1028
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:04,293
That was fucked up.
That's all there is to it.

1029
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:08,130
That's not what I planned.
It just all went to shit.

1030
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:11,800
Just shit.
Got totally out of control.

1031
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:16,138
What's fucking happening here?

1032
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:22,102
Hey, look at me.

1033
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,941
I can't go back to that, Dan.

1034
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:30,277
Can't go back to what?

1035
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,404
To any of it.

1036
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:34,990
Those guys, the gang, that life.
I'm done with it.

1037
01:08:39,203 --> 01:08:40,662
What happened to you up there?

1038
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,631
Feed line. Back up for chow.

1039
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:52,549
Don't be late,
you piece of shit!

1040
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:56,595
Let's go if you want to eat!
Get up! Five minutes!

1041
01:08:56,637 --> 01:08:58,931
This is my fucking house!
Get up!

1042
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:01,350
What the fuck's your problem,
you assholes?

1043
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:04,561
Move! Let's go!
Open the fucking gates!

1044
01:09:04,603 --> 01:09:06,980
All right, rack 'em !

1045
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,737
Five minutes! Step forward!

1046
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:16,156
Those beds better be made.

1047
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,662
After two days, I didn't think
I'd make it a week.

1048
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:23,831
Come on, you motherfuckers!

1049
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,208
You want to eat today,
you fucking piece of shit?

1050
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,210
Hey, you white trash
piece of shit!

1051
01:09:28,252 --> 01:09:30,170
You think you're
fucking special, whitefish?

1052
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:33,382
Button that top button!
Let's go! Move!

1053
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:36,635
Are you eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole!

1054
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:39,221
I'll fucking kill you!

1055
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:42,266
I'm gonna keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit!

1056
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:47,020
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy!
I'll fucking skull-fuck you!

1057
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:49,064
Step forward!

1058
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,358
Turn to the left.

1059
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:56,905
Step forward to chow! Let's go!

1060
01:09:56,947 --> 01:09:59,449
Come on!
Hey, fish, straight ahead.

1061
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:01,785
Straight ahead, fucker!
Let's go!

1062
01:10:01,827 --> 01:10:04,955
All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway...

1063
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:08,125
so I figured I'd put up a flag
and hope a friend sees it.

1064
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:13,524
That's the cat I'm talking
about right there.

1065
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,711
Boss.

1066
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:36,338
Have a seat.

1067
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:38,507
It's a pleasure.

1068
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,978
Don't fuck with me, all right?

1069
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:53,355
'Cause I'm the most dangerous
man in this prison.

1070
01:11:53,397 --> 01:11:57,317
You know why?
'Cause I control the underwear.

1071
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:08,120
We pick 'em up over here,
and we store 'em over there.

1072
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:10,122
And I hope you work out,
all right?

1073
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:13,167
'Cause the last guy they sent me
didn't wear no drawers...

1074
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,377
couldn't read
the sizes in the drawers...

1075
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:17,588
and used to sniff
the drawers, all right?

1076
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:20,048
We got two sizes--medium
and large, all right?

1077
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,551
All you gotta do is put
the mediums with the mediums...

1078
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:24,219
and the larges with
the larges, all right?

1079
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:26,221
I know it's a boring job...

1080
01:12:26,263 --> 01:12:28,432
but it's better than that
last shit they had me doing.

1081
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:32,394
I spent two years in the kitchen
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1082
01:12:32,436 --> 01:12:35,314
That you don't wanna do,
all right?

1083
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:37,357
You should be happy as shit
you landed this job.

1084
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:40,235
There's no telling what they'd
have you do up in the joint.

1085
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:45,282
By the way...

1086
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:46,950
what you in for?

1087
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:51,622
Probably robbed
some old lady, huh?

1088
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:05,719
OK, I know your kind, right?

1089
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:08,096
Bad-ass peckerwood
with an attitude.

1090
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:13,894
Let me tell you something, man,
you better watch your ass...

1091
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:17,773
'cause in the joint,
you the nigger, not me.

1092
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:25,364
I was a year in.
I thought I was cruising.

1093
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:28,116
Then everything started
getting complicated.

1094
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:56,770
What the fuck is that?

1095
01:13:58,230 --> 01:13:59,481
What's that all about?

1096
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:03,193
That's just politics, man.
Favors, you know?

1097
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:07,698
He's doing favors
for that fucking spic?

1098
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:11,243
Mitch has just got
a little something extra...

1099
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:13,620
on the side
with them boys, you know?

1100
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:15,873
You're kidding, right?

1101
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:18,041
No.

1102
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,043
That's bullshit, man.

1103
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:21,712
Somebody should say something
to him.

1104
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:23,380
What the fuck is he thinking?

1105
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:26,300
Mitch is the only reason
you're not a corpse right now.

1106
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:28,760
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.

1107
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:31,013
I can take care of myself.

1108
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:34,975
He shouldn't be doing that.
I'm getting sick of it, man.

1109
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:37,728
There's a lot of hard talk here
and no follow-through.

1110
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:44,318
I think you better chill out
on the preaching bullshit.

1111
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:46,778
We're getting a little tired
of that shit around here.

1112
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:50,365
Ease up on it.

1113
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:21,647
What are you doing here, Doris?

1114
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:23,857
I was in the neighborhood.

1115
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:26,652
Look, I told you I don't want
you all coming up here.

1116
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:29,863
I don't care
what you told me, OK?

1117
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:31,198
I need to talk to you now.

1118
01:15:51,802 --> 01:15:53,303
So, how is everyone?

1119
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:57,808
Davina's great. She's getting
straight As almost.

1120
01:15:57,808 --> 01:16:03,272
And Ally's walking,
starting to talk a little.

1121
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:09,444
How's Danny?

1122
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:18,036
He holds you up so high.

1123
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:21,373
He thinks you're the greatest.

1124
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:24,543
He's always bragging
about you to Cameron...

1125
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:26,503
and all his new friends.

1126
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,884
He's starting
to remind me of you.

1127
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:34,887
Jesus, don't sound
so worried, all right?

1128
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:38,974
I'm sure he's fine.
He's 16 years old, Doris.

1129
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:40,767
He's not gonna be
a little angel forever.

1130
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,270
You think because
I watched my firstborn...

1131
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:45,939
fuck up his entire life
that I can sit here...

1132
01:16:45,981 --> 01:16:49,401
and see my baby follow
him down the same toilet?

1133
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,153
I can't fix all this shit
from up here.

1134
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:53,113
I'm not asking you to.

1135
01:16:53,155 --> 01:16:56,492
All it does is make me feel bad.
You're just making it harder.

1136
01:16:56,533 --> 01:17:00,078
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1137
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,331
You think
you're here all alone?

1138
01:17:02,372 --> 01:17:04,208
You think I'm not in here
with you?

1139
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:18,305
Fuck, man.

1140
01:17:21,183 --> 01:17:23,477
Every day I watch you
go through these sheets...

1141
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,354
like you gonna get
to the end of them.

1142
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:28,816
Look, nigger,
will you chill the fuck out?

1143
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:30,150
Goddamn!

1144
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:32,361
No matter how fast
you get through them...

1145
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:34,947
they gonna keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1146
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:36,698
Throwing them around
like that...

1147
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,867
ain't gonna do a damn thing
but give you a heart attack!

1148
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:40,661
And you know what?
That's cool with me!

1149
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:43,121
But you gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack, too!

1150
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:53,757
I know, I'm just a dumb,
stupid nigger, right?

1151
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:55,509
What do I know?

1152
01:17:57,553 --> 01:18:01,098
I know I ain't the one getting
mad at them sheets, though.

1153
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:04,143
As a matter of fact,
the only sheets I get mad at...

1154
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:06,145
I'll tell you.

1155
01:18:07,646 --> 01:18:10,232
All right, boy,
this is what we gonna do.

1156
01:18:10,274 --> 01:18:12,109
We gonna hate some niggers.
That's what we'll do today.

1157
01:18:12,151 --> 01:18:13,902
We gonna hate
some goddamn niggers.

1158
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:15,445
That's all we gonna do is
hate some niggers all day.

1159
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:18,657
Don't know what a nigger is,
but we gonna hate them.

1160
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:20,617
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

1161
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:24,997
workin' next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy.

1162
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:45,517
See? That's the ticket.

1163
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:47,811
Nice and easy.

1164
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:51,106
Now we can ignore
each other in peace.

1165
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:57,654
"What are you doing?"
You know what he tells me?

1166
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,449
"It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck."

1167
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:05,746
He never lets me
finish the joke.

1168
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:07,247
You fuck him, too?

1169
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:12,252
Whatever. She's laying on
her back, her legs are open...

1170
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:18,467
What's up? How you doing?
There you go.

1171
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:32,397
He was taking it
from the Mexicans...

1172
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,525
and dealing it out
to his own people.

1173
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:37,611
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

1174
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:06,515
What? Come on, man.

1175
01:20:06,557 --> 01:20:10,769
Don't look at me like that.
You know what that smells like.

1176
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:13,188
Don't tell me this smell
don't remind you of a woman.

1177
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:16,942
God, I miss that smell, man.

1178
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:21,488
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much better than this...

1179
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:23,699
but at least I got
to go home every night...

1180
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,201
and lie down next to
that sweet smell, man.

1181
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:31,707
God, I miss that.
You got a woman?

1182
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:34,710
Yeah, you got a woman, man.

1183
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:37,337
Let me give you some advice,
all right?

1184
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:40,215
When she comes to visit you...

1185
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:42,217
whatever you do,
no matter what...

1186
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:44,219
don't let her leave here
in a fight, man.

1187
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:46,221
Don't let her walk out
with a bad attitude...

1188
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:48,891
'cause if you do,
you spend the next week...

1189
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:51,727
wondering if she's getting her
fuck on with somebody else...

1190
01:20:51,768 --> 01:20:53,228
you know what I'm saying?

1191
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:55,731
So when she come to see you,
it's nothing but sweet talk.

1192
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:58,442
Send her away floating,
all right?

1193
01:20:58,484 --> 01:21:01,737
'Cause it's not like the real
world where you can fight...

1194
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:04,907
'cause you can make up
and have that make-up sex.

1195
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:06,825
Know what I'm saying?
That angry sex.

1196
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:08,577
That sex with an attitude.

1197
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:11,955
You lay on your back and let her
take out that aggression on you.

1198
01:21:11,997 --> 01:21:13,624
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1199
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:16,502
That's that pow, pow, pow.

1200
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:19,505
Let her get on top,
and she'll punish you first.

1201
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:21,173
"You been a bad boy, huh?

1202
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:24,051
"You been a bad boy,
and I'm gonna punish you.

1203
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:25,677
"I'm gonna put it on you.

1204
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:29,181
"Don't you ever...
let...me...catch...you...

1205
01:21:29,223 --> 01:21:32,518
"looking at...another...woman.
Yeah, yeah.

1206
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:34,186
"I may forgive you
if you bring it.

1207
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:36,688
"I think I can. I--I forgive.

1208
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:39,817
"I forgive. Right there.
You're hitting it.

1209
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:41,819
"My spot. That's it. Right.

1210
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:45,656
"Yes. I for--I forgive you.
I forgive you.

1211
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:48,325
"I for--I for--
I for--I forgive you!

1212
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:50,536
"I love you!"

1213
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:10,139
How do you figure the Lakers
to ever be a bigger dynasty...

1214
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,974
than the Celtics?

1215
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:14,518
The Lakers
are a flare-up, a fluke.

1216
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:15,727
Are you crazy?

1217
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:17,813
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are a dynasty!

1218
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:20,482
Come on, man.
The Celtics, right?

1219
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:22,734
The ugliest team in
the history of sports.

1220
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:24,903
A dynasty of
ugly motherfuckers, man.

1221
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,156
Look at Kevin McHale.

1222
01:22:27,197 --> 01:22:29,950
James Worthy. That guy
has a head like a melon.

1223
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:31,326
He had ladies.

1224
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:34,037
I can't even talk to you.
I don't know what you're saying.

1225
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,999
You are tweaking.
Boston Celtics.

1226
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,168
-How many is that?
-That's enough.

1227
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:40,377
Enough? All right.

1228
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:45,549
You got that?

1229
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:53,223
-I lost count, man.
-Doesn't matter, man.

1230
01:22:53,223 --> 01:22:55,726
Who's counting anyway?

1231
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:05,194
All right,
so I wanna know something.

1232
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:08,197
What the fuck
landed you in here?

1233
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:10,449
You didn't kill anybody,
too skinny for a gangbanger.

1234
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:13,160
Ain't that a bitch?
Don't judge a book by its cover.

1235
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:14,620
I can throw these things.

1236
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:17,539
Whatever. Come on.
What did you do?

1237
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:20,167
None of your business.
It's embarrassing.

1238
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:22,044
It's none of
your goddamn business.

1239
01:23:23,212 --> 01:23:26,173
Come on. Everybody in here
is embarrassed.

1240
01:23:26,215 --> 01:23:28,675
Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1241
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:31,178
What'd you do?

1242
01:23:33,055 --> 01:23:35,682
Look, man, I stole a TV,
all right?

1243
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:38,393
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing about that?

1244
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:42,189
I stole a TV from a store
next to a doughnut shop.

1245
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:45,192
I ran out, the owner's
right behind me yelling.

1246
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:47,110
Bam ! I run into three cops.

1247
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:50,614
I told you it was embarrassing.
You're laughing.

1248
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,200
Wait a sec, wait a sec.

1249
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:55,077
That don't make sense.

1250
01:23:56,328 --> 01:24:00,165
Nah, you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV. Come on.

1251
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:03,627
I come out, the police officer
grabs my arm...

1252
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:05,629
the TV falls on his foot
and breaks it.

1253
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:10,425
They said I threw the TV at him.
Assault. Six years.

1254
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:14,596
Come on. Tell the truth.
You chucked it at him.

1255
01:24:14,638 --> 01:24:17,599
Like I said,
I came out of the store...

1256
01:24:17,641 --> 01:24:21,270
he grabbed my arm,
it fell on his foot.

1257
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:27,317
Come on now.

1258
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:30,112
What you got for me, huh?

1259
01:24:31,155 --> 01:24:32,489
There you go, baby!

1260
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:34,908
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.

1261
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:14,698
Fuck you!

1262
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:16,617
Give me a towel. Hold him.

1263
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:25,709
You wanna be a nigger,
sweet boy?

1264
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:28,337
-Fuck you!
-We gonna treat you like one.

1265
01:25:28,378 --> 01:25:31,507
-No.
-Come on.

1266
01:25:33,509 --> 01:25:35,177
Come on, give it to him !

1267
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:47,940
Fuck you!

1268
01:25:51,902 --> 01:25:54,363
That was real sweet.

1269
01:25:54,404 --> 01:25:55,572
Fuck you!

1270
01:26:28,147 --> 01:26:29,189
How is he?

1271
01:26:30,357 --> 01:26:32,693
Well, he took six stitches.

1272
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:17,154
Man, what the hell are you
doing here, anyway?

1273
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:20,282
I came to talk about Danny, but
we don't have to do that now.

1274
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:22,326
I brought you some books.

1275
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:27,956
What about him, you know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1276
01:27:27,998 --> 01:27:30,000
He's headed right where you are.

1277
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:34,630
You know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me.

1278
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:37,382
Danny's not my responsibility.

1279
01:27:37,424 --> 01:27:39,134
What do you expect me
to do with that?

1280
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:41,970
It doesn't help me.
Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1281
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:43,430
I don't want you to do anything.

1282
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:46,141
I need to know the truth
about how you feel.

1283
01:27:46,183 --> 01:27:48,185
You think I want him in here?

1284
01:27:48,185 --> 01:27:50,646
I mean...I don't know.

1285
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:52,147
I don't know what I feel.
I'm all...

1286
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:56,485
I feel a little inside out.

1287
01:27:56,527 --> 01:27:58,529
I'm, you know--I don't know.

1288
01:27:58,529 --> 01:28:02,449
There's some things
that...that don't fit.

1289
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:04,701
Well, that happens.

1290
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:08,372
You are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

1291
01:28:08,413 --> 01:28:10,833
pretending you don't see
all the holes in this bullshit.

1292
01:28:10,874 --> 01:28:12,793
Hey, listen.
I said I was confused.

1293
01:28:12,835 --> 01:28:15,003
I didn't say
I didn't believe in it.

1294
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:17,131
All right. That's why
you have to stay open.

1295
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:19,633
Right now, your anger
is consuming you here.

1296
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:22,845
Your anger is shutting down
the brain God gave you.

1297
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:24,888
God. You know, man?
You've been talking about...

1298
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:26,765
what's going on with me
since I was in high school.

1299
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:29,643
How the fuck do you know
what's going on inside me?

1300
01:28:29,685 --> 01:28:33,647
No, I know about me.
I know about this place.

1301
01:28:33,689 --> 01:28:35,649
I know about the place
you are in.

1302
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:38,443
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

1303
01:28:38,485 --> 01:28:40,654
There was a moment...

1304
01:28:40,696 --> 01:28:43,657
when I used to blame
everything and everyone...

1305
01:28:43,699 --> 01:28:46,160
for all
the pain and suffering...

1306
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:48,328
and vile things
that happened to me...

1307
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:50,914
that I saw happen to my people.

1308
01:28:50,956 --> 01:28:52,749
Used to blame everybody.

1309
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:56,336
Blamed white people,
blamed society, blamed God.

1310
01:28:56,378 --> 01:28:59,548
I didn't get no answers 'cause
I asked the wrong questions.

1311
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:02,092
You have to ask
the right question.

1312
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:03,385
Like what?

1313
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:08,724
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1314
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:30,662
You gotta help me, man.

1315
01:29:33,457 --> 01:29:35,167
Just help me.

1316
01:29:37,002 --> 01:29:39,046
Get me out of here, you know?

1317
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,510
I'm up in four months
for review.

1318
01:29:46,178 --> 01:29:48,180
Put in a word for me.

1319
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:50,766
I already have. So you're
out there, and then what?

1320
01:29:50,808 --> 01:29:53,644
I don't want to fuck up
my family anymore.

1321
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:55,938
I'll go as far away
as I can get.

1322
01:29:55,979 --> 01:29:57,773
That's not good enough.

1323
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:01,235
You want my help,
you gotta do better than that.

1324
01:30:01,276 --> 01:30:03,737
My help is not unconditional.

1325
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:07,032
Running just ain't good enough.

1326
01:30:39,731 --> 01:30:43,026
Fuck him. Fuck him.

1327
01:30:43,068 --> 01:30:44,778
Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1328
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:47,573
What's up, D?

1329
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:50,826
What's all that bullshit
you pulled in the mess hall?

1330
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:54,913
You out of your fuckin' mind?
Are you fuckin' crazy?

1331
01:30:54,955 --> 01:30:57,249
D, look at me, man!

1332
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:59,877
You can't make it in here
on your own.

1333
01:30:59,918 --> 01:31:02,004
I'm not afraid of
those fuckin' pussies.

1334
01:31:02,045 --> 01:31:04,173
There was six of them,
and they jumped me.

1335
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:06,592
That won't happen again.
I hope they fuckin' try.

1336
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:09,136
Man, I'm not talking
about your peckerwood friends!

1337
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:11,513
They're protecting
your stupid ass!

1338
01:31:11,555 --> 01:31:15,350
You dissed them in public!
Now you're on your fuckin' own!

1339
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:18,187
Yo, man, I'm talking about
the brothers, all right?

1340
01:31:18,228 --> 01:31:21,356
They'll fuck you, then
smoke your motherfucking ass!

1341
01:31:21,398 --> 01:31:24,026
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

1342
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:26,195
You think I haven't
thought about that?

1343
01:31:26,236 --> 01:31:29,698
If they come for me, they come.
There ain't nothing I can do.

1344
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:32,868
What can I do, man?

1345
01:31:37,748 --> 01:31:40,209
So I was right back
where I started.

1346
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,294
Every day
I was sure it was my day.

1347
01:31:43,504 --> 01:31:46,465
Every time
I stepped out of my cell...

1348
01:31:46,507 --> 01:31:49,218
every time
I got in that shower...

1349
01:31:52,304 --> 01:31:54,223
I figured it was
only a matter of time...

1350
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:56,225
before they made a move.

1351
01:31:57,434 --> 01:31:59,561
I just hoped it'd be quick.

1352
01:32:31,218 --> 01:32:33,554
But it never came.

1353
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:36,515
I couldn't figure it out.

1354
01:32:36,557 --> 01:32:38,517
I knew some of them
were itching for it.

1355
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:40,561
After awhile,
I just put my head down...

1356
01:32:40,644 --> 01:32:42,437
and read the stuff
that Sweeney sent me...

1357
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:44,231
and I kept to myself.

1358
01:32:46,316 --> 01:32:49,945
Last six months in that place,
I was like a ghost.

1359
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:06,211
What's up, man?
You getting out?

1360
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:10,132
Come on, man.
What the fuck you waiting on?

1361
01:33:10,174 --> 01:33:12,301
Get the fuck on outta here, man.

1362
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:16,221
Yeah, you know,
I got this funny feeling.

1363
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:18,140
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1364
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:21,268
I'm thinking maybe
the only reason...

1365
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:23,145
I'm getting out of here
in one piece is you.

1366
01:33:24,688 --> 01:33:26,148
Come on, man!
Get the fuck outta here!

1367
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:28,192
You think I'm gonna
put my neck on the line...

1368
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,235
for some crazy ass peckerwood?

1369
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:32,154
Yeah. Right.

1370
01:33:32,196 --> 01:33:34,364
Stupid.

1371
01:33:40,037 --> 01:33:41,705
That's what I thought.

1372
01:33:46,043 --> 01:33:48,295
I owe you, man.

1373
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:50,506
Man, you don't owe me shit,
all right?

1374
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:54,468
Yes, I do.

1375
01:34:04,686 --> 01:34:06,647
You'll be outta here in no time.

1376
01:34:06,688 --> 01:34:09,066
Man,
it's a piece of cake, all right?

1377
01:34:11,318 --> 01:34:13,153
Just take it easy
on the brothers, all right?

1378
01:34:13,195 --> 01:34:14,279
The brothers!

1379
01:34:24,706 --> 01:34:26,166
God, man.

1380
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:30,546
Sorry, Derek.

1381
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:33,715
Sorry that happened to you.

1382
01:34:34,883 --> 01:34:38,011
Well, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1383
01:34:38,053 --> 01:34:41,014
I feel lucky,
'cause it's wrong, Dan.

1384
01:34:43,392 --> 01:34:45,185
It's wrong,
and it was eating me up.

1385
01:34:45,227 --> 01:34:47,187
It was gonna kill me.

1386
01:34:47,229 --> 01:34:49,231
And I kept asking myself
all the time...

1387
01:34:49,273 --> 01:34:53,235
how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1388
01:34:54,903 --> 01:34:56,738
It's just 'cause
I was pissed off.

1389
01:34:57,948 --> 01:35:01,160
Nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1390
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:05,622
I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1391
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:09,668
And it didn't make me
feel any different.

1392
01:35:10,878 --> 01:35:12,212
Just got me more lost...

1393
01:35:12,254 --> 01:35:14,715
and I'm tired of feeling
pissed-off, Danny.

1394
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:17,718
I'm just tired of it.

1395
01:35:17,759 --> 01:35:20,179
And I'm not telling you
what to do.

1396
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,848
I'm really not.

1397
01:35:23,849 --> 01:35:26,018
But I need you to understand...

1398
01:35:27,853 --> 01:35:31,190
'cause I love you,
and you're my best friend.

1399
01:35:33,317 --> 01:35:35,194
Do you understand?

1400
01:35:35,235 --> 01:35:37,196
Yeah, I understand.

1401
01:35:40,699 --> 01:35:42,034
All right.

1402
01:35:46,038 --> 01:35:47,539
Jesus.

1403
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:06,141
Hi. Everything OK?

1404
01:36:06,183 --> 01:36:07,559
Ah, everything's great.

1405
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:10,354
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1406
01:36:10,395 --> 01:36:12,356
-No. Thank you.
-You sure?

1407
01:36:12,397 --> 01:36:15,651
Yeah. This is good.
Thank you.

1408
01:36:15,692 --> 01:36:18,153
All right. Come on, let's go.

1409
01:36:39,383 --> 01:36:40,384
Good night.

1410
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:49,203
I'm gonna take a shower,
all right?

1411
01:38:23,403 --> 01:38:24,655
It's hard to look back...

1412
01:38:24,696 --> 01:38:27,616
and see the truth
about people you love.

1413
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:30,619
I think if you asked Derek why
it all went the way it did...

1414
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,287
and where it all started...

1415
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:35,165
he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

1416
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:38,627
The truth is,
it started earlier.

1417
01:38:38,669 --> 01:38:41,880
Are we all meeting
for the game tonight?

1418
01:38:41,922 --> 01:38:43,132
Definitely.

1419
01:38:43,173 --> 01:38:44,800
All right,
Ben's Burger at 7:00...

1420
01:38:44,842 --> 01:38:46,176
then we go watch
the big guy play.

1421
01:38:48,679 --> 01:38:50,639
Psyching up for the game?

1422
01:38:50,681 --> 01:38:53,767
I'm always ready for that.
I got an English exam.

1423
01:38:53,851 --> 01:38:56,145
I'm having a heart attack.
I'm not ready.

1424
01:38:56,186 --> 01:38:58,188
What's the matter?
Afraid you'll get a "B"?

1425
01:38:58,230 --> 01:39:01,150
Might do you good. B-minus.

1426
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:04,111
Hey, don't laugh.
This guy is different.

1427
01:39:04,153 --> 01:39:06,613
Dr. Sweeney.
This guy's unbelievable.

1428
01:39:06,655 --> 01:39:08,657
Unbelievable. I've never
had a teacher like this.

1429
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:09,908
He's got two Ph.D.s.

1430
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:13,579
I don't know what he's doing
teaching at our school.

1431
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,830
What's he got you reading?

1432
01:39:14,872 --> 01:39:18,500
We got this essay exam
on "Native Son."

1433
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:21,003
"Native Son"?
I don't know that.

1434
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:22,588
That's a big surprise.

1435
01:39:23,714 --> 01:39:25,090
What? I read.

1436
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:29,678
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy in school.

1437
01:39:31,346 --> 01:39:33,140
Well, they don't.

1438
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:34,641
So what is this "Native Son"?

1439
01:39:35,809 --> 01:39:38,187
It's this book
about this black guy.

1440
01:39:38,228 --> 01:39:41,190
We're doing this whole
black literature unit.

1441
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:43,692
Is it Black History Month?

1442
01:39:43,734 --> 01:39:46,153
No, it's just
this guy Sweeney, you know?

1443
01:39:46,195 --> 01:39:48,030
It's part of the course now.

1444
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:56,288
What?

1445
01:39:56,330 --> 01:39:59,166
Nothing. It's just...

1446
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,293
It's everywhere I look now.

1447
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:03,045
What?

1448
01:40:04,713 --> 01:40:07,508
This affirmative blacktion.

1449
01:40:07,549 --> 01:40:12,471
A few new books doesn't qualify
as affirmative black action.

1450
01:40:13,597 --> 01:40:15,390
Read the book,
ace the guy's test.

1451
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:17,851
Just don't swallow
everything he feeds you whole.

1452
01:40:17,893 --> 01:40:19,436
Just 'cause you see it
on the evening news...

1453
01:40:19,478 --> 01:40:20,604
I know, but what?

1454
01:40:20,646 --> 01:40:22,689
All this stuff about
making everything equal.

1455
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:24,191
It's not that simple.

1456
01:40:24,233 --> 01:40:26,193
Now you got this book
"Native Son."

1457
01:40:26,235 --> 01:40:28,195
What happened to
the other books in the course?

1458
01:40:28,237 --> 01:40:32,699
They're not any good anymore
because Mr. Two Ph.D. says so?

1459
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:35,202
Now you gotta trade in
great books for black books?

1460
01:40:35,244 --> 01:40:37,871
Does that make sense?

1461
01:40:37,913 --> 01:40:40,040
You gotta question
these things, Derek.

1462
01:40:40,082 --> 01:40:42,042
You gotta look
at the whole picture.

1463
01:40:42,084 --> 01:40:45,254
We're talking about books here.
I'm also talking about my job.

1464
01:40:45,295 --> 01:40:48,215
I got two black guys
on my squad now...

1465
01:40:48,257 --> 01:40:50,717
who got their job
over a couple of white guys...

1466
01:40:50,759 --> 01:40:52,803
who actually scored higher
on the test.

1467
01:40:52,845 --> 01:40:56,223
Does that make sense?

1468
01:40:56,265 --> 01:40:59,810
Everything's equal now, but I
got two guys watching my back...

1469
01:40:59,852 --> 01:41:03,814
responsible for my life
who aren't as good.

1470
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:05,649
They only got the job
because they were black...

1471
01:41:05,691 --> 01:41:07,985
not because they were the best.

1472
01:41:08,026 --> 01:41:11,071
-That sucks.
-Is that what America's about?

1473
01:41:11,155 --> 01:41:13,157
No, America's about
best man for the job.

1474
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:15,325
You do your best,
you get the job.

1475
01:41:15,367 --> 01:41:18,328
This affirmative-action crap...

1476
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,164
I don't know what that's about.

1477
01:41:20,205 --> 01:41:24,334
There's like some hidden agenda
or something going on.

1478
01:41:24,376 --> 01:41:25,836
You see what I'm saying?

1479
01:41:25,878 --> 01:41:28,464
Yeah, I do. I didn't
think about it like that.

1480
01:41:30,007 --> 01:41:32,176
This guy, though--I don't know.

1481
01:41:32,217 --> 01:41:34,303
Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on so strong...

1482
01:41:34,344 --> 01:41:36,180
it's hard
not to listen to him...

1483
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:38,765
but maybe some of
what he says is kinda...

1484
01:41:38,807 --> 01:41:40,017
It's bullshit.

1485
01:41:41,226 --> 01:41:43,353
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1486
01:41:43,395 --> 01:41:47,232
No. It's nigger bullshit.

1487
01:41:49,568 --> 01:41:52,321
-You see that, don't you?
-Yeah.

1488
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:54,198
You gotta watch out for that.

1489
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:57,201
Yeah. No, I get what
you're saying. I will.

1490
01:41:58,744 --> 01:42:00,662
Good boy.

1491
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:02,789
I'm proud of you.

1492
01:42:02,873 --> 01:42:04,500
Don't worry about it. I got it.

1493
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:12,127
And in about one minute...

1494
01:44:12,169 --> 01:44:14,713
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1495
01:44:14,755 --> 01:44:17,007
I don't know
if I've ever done that.

1496
01:44:18,175 --> 01:44:21,512
Anyway, we're gonna try to pick
things up and start over.

1497
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:24,973
It won't be easy,
but we're all together again...

1498
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:27,100
and I feel good.

1499
01:44:28,185 --> 01:44:31,146
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted--

1500
01:44:31,188 --> 01:44:33,148
if I hit
the social significance...

1501
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:35,400
or whatever
you're looking for...

1502
01:44:35,442 --> 01:44:38,946
but for what it's worth,
thanks a lot.

1503
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:57,714
Wow. You look great.
Look at you.

1504
01:44:59,383 --> 01:45:02,344
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

1505
01:45:02,386 --> 01:45:03,679
Is she cute?

1506
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,848
She is a fat guy named Hector...

1507
01:45:05,889 --> 01:45:09,143
-Oh. Well...
-So I'm out of luck.

1508
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,147
I just gotta check in...

1509
01:45:13,188 --> 01:45:15,274
then I'm gonna see about
getting my old job back.

1510
01:45:15,315 --> 01:45:18,193
-Great.
-Good morning.

1511
01:45:19,403 --> 01:45:20,654
Davina, can you help?

1512
01:45:20,696 --> 01:45:22,156
Your sister's gonna help you.

1513
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:24,908
You look great. Knock 'em dead.

1514
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,493
Thanks.

1515
01:45:26,535 --> 01:45:28,954
Come on, sweetie. What would
you like to wear today?

1516
01:45:31,582 --> 01:45:34,793
-You do look good.
-Yeah? I feel silly.

1517
01:45:34,835 --> 01:45:37,212
-You look good.
-Yeah?

1518
01:45:39,214 --> 01:45:40,674
You feel good?

1519
01:45:43,552 --> 01:45:46,680
Yeah. I feel, you know...

1520
01:45:46,722 --> 01:45:48,682
a little...

1521
01:45:48,724 --> 01:45:51,101
I'm getting there.

1522
01:45:52,728 --> 01:45:54,605
Listen...I don't know--

1523
01:45:56,273 --> 01:45:58,567
I don't know
if it's OK that I'm here.

1524
01:46:02,654 --> 01:46:03,906
I want to be here.

1525
01:46:22,674 --> 01:46:24,426
-I'm gonna get a paper.
-Cool.

1526
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:44,988
-What do you want?
-Maple bar and a large milk.

1527
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:46,532
All right. I got it.

1528
01:46:50,994 --> 01:46:52,996
Let me get a coffee...

1529
01:46:53,038 --> 01:46:55,666
a maple bar,
and a large milk to go.

1530
01:46:55,707 --> 01:46:56,750
Right away.

1531
01:47:06,802 --> 01:47:09,638
Derek, we need to talk.

1532
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,140
What's going on?

1533
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:15,602
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1534
01:47:15,686 --> 01:47:17,146
They were jumped last night
near Ben's Burgers.

1535
01:47:17,146 --> 01:47:18,981
How bad?

1536
01:47:18,981 --> 01:47:20,649
Well, it looks
like they're gonna live.

1537
01:47:20,691 --> 01:47:23,777
-Then they got lucky.
-Somebody's gotta lose, though.

1538
01:47:26,572 --> 01:47:27,573
What?

1539
01:47:28,824 --> 01:47:31,994
We were kinda hoping maybe
you'd talk to your old crew--

1540
01:47:32,035 --> 01:47:33,620
Come on. No way.

1541
01:47:33,704 --> 01:47:36,832
If there's anybody they're
gonna listen to, it's you.

1542
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:39,084
No. I hate to tell you,
but I'm out, OK?

1543
01:47:39,126 --> 01:47:41,086
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1544
01:47:41,128 --> 01:47:43,130
We're asking
for your help here, Derek.

1545
01:47:43,172 --> 01:47:45,048
Did you tell him
I was gonna do this?

1546
01:47:51,847 --> 01:47:54,183
This has got nothing
to do with me anymore.

1547
01:47:54,183 --> 01:47:57,186
Yes, it does. It has
everything to do with you.

1548
01:47:57,186 --> 01:47:59,855
God, what are you doing to me?
I'm doing my best!

1549
01:47:59,855 --> 01:48:02,608
I'm going like this just to keep
my family in the clear.

1550
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:04,067
Don't ask me to fix
this fuckin' situation!

1551
01:48:04,109 --> 01:48:06,069
-I'm not asking that.
-It was there before me.

1552
01:48:06,111 --> 01:48:09,114
You helped create it.
You wanna take a break now?

1553
01:48:09,156 --> 01:48:10,866
You take a break,
you'll find no peace.

1554
01:48:10,908 --> 01:48:14,077
The way to find peace
is to stick.

1555
01:48:14,119 --> 01:48:16,121
It's not gonna make
a fuckin' bit of difference.

1556
01:48:16,163 --> 01:48:19,291
-It might.
-Not a bit.

1557
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:22,961
I mean, do you know
what you're asking me to do?

1558
01:48:23,003 --> 01:48:25,964
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever's in your power to do.

1559
01:48:27,466 --> 01:48:29,760
Oh, man.

1560
01:48:32,513 --> 01:48:33,847
Fuck.

1561
01:48:38,435 --> 01:48:39,853
All right.

1562
01:48:41,688 --> 01:48:44,650
You know what you're gonna do?
Get me shot by white boys.

1563
01:48:44,691 --> 01:48:46,652
I doubt it.

1564
01:48:46,693 --> 01:48:49,738
We're all gonna have a laugh
at that, let me tell ya.

1565
01:48:50,948 --> 01:48:54,409
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1566
01:48:54,409 --> 01:48:55,828
Come on.

1567
01:48:55,869 --> 01:48:59,665
Hey, you. You got something
good for me this morning?

1568
01:48:59,706 --> 01:49:00,916
I'll give it to you,
Dr. Sweeney.

1569
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:02,251
-Yeah, OK.
-All right.

1570
01:49:07,047 --> 01:49:09,049
What's goin' on?

1571
01:49:14,138 --> 01:49:15,305
Come on, let's go.

1572
01:49:30,946 --> 01:49:34,116
It's just so bad for Seth, man.

1573
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:36,827
I wonder how bad
they got fucked up.

1574
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:40,497
I'm glad they're not dead.
Other than that, I don't care.

1575
01:49:41,999 --> 01:49:43,459
Should we visit them?

1576
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,128
No. Definitely not.

1577
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:48,213
Just stay out of it.

1578
01:49:48,255 --> 01:49:52,134
Listen. I saw a car cruising
by the house last night...

1579
01:49:52,176 --> 01:49:53,969
when I pulled
out of there with Seth.

1580
01:49:54,011 --> 01:49:57,139
If you get home before me today,
give a look around the street.

1581
01:49:57,181 --> 01:49:59,683
Make sure
there's nothing going on.

1582
01:50:00,684 --> 01:50:02,769
Man, this is bad.

1583
01:50:05,022 --> 01:50:07,983
-They're after you, man.
-It'll cool off.

1584
01:50:08,025 --> 01:50:11,570
If I made it through Chino,
this should be a piece of cake.

1585
01:50:13,864 --> 01:50:14,865
You gonna be OK?

1586
01:50:20,078 --> 01:50:21,205
What are you gonna do?

1587
01:50:21,246 --> 01:50:24,666
I'll work it out.
Keep your head up, all right?

1588
01:50:24,708 --> 01:50:28,086
Things are gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

1589
01:50:28,128 --> 01:50:29,963
Go turn that paper in.

1590
01:50:31,715 --> 01:50:34,885
All right. See ya.

1591
01:50:34,927 --> 01:50:36,220
Come here.

1592
01:50:42,059 --> 01:50:43,519
I'll see you at home.

1593
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:46,814
All right?

1594
01:50:48,065 --> 01:50:50,651
Yeah, I'll see you.
Good luck, all right?

1595
01:50:50,692 --> 01:50:53,737
-Yeah.
-See you later.

1596
01:50:59,493 --> 01:51:01,912
-Gonna be late.
-We better go.

1597
01:51:02,913 --> 01:51:04,331
All right. Come on.

1598
01:51:27,271 --> 01:51:28,313
Bye.

1599
01:51:28,355 --> 01:51:31,567
I'll catch up with you.
See you later.

1600
01:52:53,315 --> 01:52:55,150
Get out of my way!

1601
01:52:55,192 --> 01:52:56,985
All right! Let him go!

1602
01:52:59,488 --> 01:53:00,614
Oh, no.

1603
01:53:03,742 --> 01:53:05,828
Aw, Jesus.

1604
01:53:29,351 --> 01:53:31,186
Oh, Jesus.

1605
01:53:31,186 --> 01:53:33,188
God, what did I do?

1606
01:54:01,341 --> 01:54:05,304
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1607
01:54:05,345 --> 01:54:07,181
My conclusion, right?

1608
01:54:08,182 --> 01:54:12,102
Well, my conclusion is
hate is baggage.

1609
01:54:12,936 --> 01:54:16,148
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1610
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:18,358
It's just not worth it.

1611
01:54:21,111 --> 01:54:24,656
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1612
01:54:24,698 --> 01:54:27,159
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1613
01:54:27,201 --> 01:54:29,161
so if you can't top it...

1614
01:54:29,203 --> 01:54:31,663
steal from them
and go out strong.

1615
01:54:31,705 --> 01:54:34,208
So I picked a guy
I thought you'd like.

1616
01:54:36,043 --> 01:54:39,671
"We are not enemies,
but friends.

1617
01:54:39,713 --> 01:54:42,007
"We must not be enemies.

1618
01:54:42,049 --> 01:54:44,510
"Though passion
may have strained...

1619
01:54:44,551 --> 01:54:47,346
"we must not break
our bonds of affection.

1620
01:54:47,387 --> 01:54:50,182
"The mystic chords of memory...

1621
01:54:50,224 --> 01:54:52,726
"will swell
when again touched...

1622
01:54:52,768 --> 01:54:54,728
"as surely they will be...

1623
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:57,731
"by the better angels
of our nature."
