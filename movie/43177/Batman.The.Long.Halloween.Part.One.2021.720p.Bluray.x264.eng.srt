Jim, what the hell
are we doing?

1154
01:19:58,755 --> 01:19:59,690
Oh.

Five-bladed prop

Hell of a way to go.

1158
01:20:12,102 --> 01:20:14,238
That isn't how he went.

1159
01:20:14,271 --> 01:20:17,408
He was shot by Holiday
before going overboard.

1160

Hang on.

1161
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:21,111
Alberto wasn't Holiday?

1162
01:20:21,145 --> 01:20:22,813
I thought he was.

It was Occam's Razor, Jim,
the simplest solution.

1164

But it was wrong.

I went there
for Alberto Falcone.

01:20:33,358 --> 01:20:35,726
I thought I was supposed
to stop him,

1167
01:20:35,759 --> 01:20:38,662
but... I was supposed
to save him.

1168
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:43,300
He was innocent.
And now he's dead.

You have to put a protective
detail on Carmine Falcone.

If he'll even let you.

1174
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:02,753
Do you realize we started out
trying to take down The Roman,

1175
01:21:02,786 --> 01:21:04,489
and now we're trying
to save him?

1176
01:21:04,522 --> 01:21:06,323
When did that happen?

1177
01:21:06,357 --> 01:21:07,991
I have a better question.

1178
01:21:08,025 --> 01:21:11,895
If Alberto Falcone
wasn't Holiday, then who is?

1179
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:14,164
And who's next?

PRIEST: Grant that our brother may sleep
here in peace until You awaken him to glory,

1181
01:24:06,937 --> 01:24:10,173
for You are the resurrection
and the life.

1182
01:24:10,207 --> 01:24:12,377
Then he will see You
face to face

1183
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:15,346
and in Your light
will see light

1184
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,582
and know the splendor of God.

Carmine.
If there's anything I can do...

1190
01:24:44,074 --> 01:24:45,676
You know what I want you to do,

1191
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,245
but time and time again
you refuse me.

The Wayne Foundation isn't a money
laundering outfit for the mob.

And it won't be,
so long as I'm in control.

1194
01:25:00,023 --> 01:25:01,057
Of course.

Oh, how rude of me.
