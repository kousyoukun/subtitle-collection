我们本来能指望韦恩
We had a chance with Wayne,

111
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,755
但他现在不管事了  我们必须重新改组

我不需要
I do not.

114
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,304
苏菲亚  如果我让你加入
Sofia, if I bring you in now,

115
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,977
新的合作者会以为我正在安排继任者
our new earners will think I am lining up a successor.

116
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,057
那会让我看起来很老气…  和软弱
And that will make me look old...  And weak.

117
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,230
你既不老气也不会没用
You are neither.

118
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,862
但也帮不上忙
Nevertheless.

119
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,988
很好  讨论结束
Good. End of discussion.

120
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:07,777

122
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,711
什么都可以  确保让大家都看得到
I don't care. Just make sure everybody sees it.

123
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,097

126
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,731
你怎么知道是稻草人干的？
How do you know it was the scarecrow?

127
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,657
克莱恩最近刚从阿卡姆逃跑
Crane recently fled arkham.

128
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,154
受害者身上的气体都是他的恐惧神经毒素
Gases all of his victims with a fear-inducing neurotoxin, so...

129
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,988
是啊  绝对就是他
Yeah, you can't really miss him.

130
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,744
所以  韦恩先生…
Look, so, Mr. Wayne...

131
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,541
叫我布鲁斯吧
Uh, it's Bruce.

132
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,413
两位要喝点什么吗？  阿福会调很棒的迈泰调酒
Can I get you anything? Alfred makes a terrific Mai Tai.

133
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,174
现在是早上八点半…
It's 8:30 in the...

134
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,427
不用了  谢谢
No. No, thank you.

135
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,510
关于除夕夜  我们有些问题想问你
We have some questions about new year's Eve.

136
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,054
阿尔贝托·法尔康尼在当晚被杀害
The night Alberto Falcone was murdered.

137
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,623
哈维整理线索后发现
Harvey here was updating the files,

138
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,229
你似乎是当晚游艇上
and it seems that you were the only passenger on that yacht

139
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,647
唯一还没提供证词的乘客
who didn't give us a statement.

140
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,315
恐怕我帮不上忙
Afraid I'm not much help.

141
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,276
我在游艇出事前就离开派对了
I left the party before all the commotion in a dinghy.

142
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,442
你们可能以为我失踪了
You probably noticed it was missing.

143
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,240
当然  若我在场就会提供证词
Of course, I'd have given you a statement anyway,

144
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,652
但那么做这件事就会登上媒体
except that it would have been a matter of public record

145
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,827
他们会把我的名字
and could place my name

146
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,871
与那天和我有约的小姐的名字刊在一起
next to that of the young lady I went to meet.

147
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,412
我认为她丈夫不是很喜欢我
I don't think her husband likes me very much.

148
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,826
还真刚好啊
That's very convenient.

149
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,328
对她老公来说并不是
Well, not for her husband.

150
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,500
以下是我想了解的部分
Here's what I'm trying to understand.

151
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,507
你最近将你产业中大片区域
You recently signed over significant areas of your business

152
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,678
转让给了卡麦·法尔康尼
to carmine Falcone.

153
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,722
那些都撤销了
That's all been reversed.

154
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:48,878
我当时被下药控制 如果你是指这个

155
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,308
你父亲和罗马人合作生意的时候
Was your father drugged and manipulated

156
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,039
也是被下药控制吗？
when he went into business with the Roman?

157
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,187
你很清楚
You know everything that monster is today

158
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,064
一手打造那头怪物的人就是韦恩…
was born of the legitimacy handed him by the name Wayne...

159
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,197
哈维
Harvey.

160
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,109
没关系
It's all right.

161
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,566
没错  我父亲和法尔康尼合盖了不少医院
Yes, my father built hospitals with Falcone.

162
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,063
但驱使他这么做的
But the only influence he was under

163
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,705
只有拯救无辜生命的强烈欲望
was an overwhelming desire to save innocent lives.

164
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,076
那么他最后用多少条人命换取这个结果？
And how many other innocent lives did he end up trading for it?

165
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,418
据我所知…两条
Two... that I know of.

166
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,706
请救救我儿子
Please help my son.

167
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,531
我没有别的地方能去了
I have nowhere else to go.

168
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,820
往这走
This way. Over here.

169
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,196
放到桌上
Onto the desk.

170
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:53,784
目测胸口有四个…  不  五个枪伤
Looks like four... No, five bullet wounds to the chest.

171
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,211
你不该来这里  你儿子应该去医院
You shouldn't have come here. Your son needs to be in a hospital.

172
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,790
好让路易吉·马洛尼  去干掉他吗？
Where Luigi maroni could find him and finish the job?

173
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,592
不  韦恩医生  求求你
No, Dr. Wayne, please.

174
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,836
卡麦是我的独子
Carmine is my only son.

175
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,300
我会尽我所能
I'll do what I can.

176
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,308
-阿福  拿我的手术用具来  -马上来  主人
- Alfred, get my bag.  - Right away, sir.

177
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,987
他的情况稳定了  但我还不打算移动他
He's stable, but I don't want to move him yet.

178
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,619
谢谢  你的恩情我难以报答
Grazie. I can never repay you.

179
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,452
他还没脱离险境
He isn't out of the woods.

180
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,628
走吧  得让他好好休息
Come on, we have to let him rest.

181
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,735
你不该待在这里
You shouldn't be here.

182
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,363
没关系
It's okay.

183
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,362
你知道我爸是谁吗？
Do you know who my father is?

184
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,992
罗马人？
The Roman?

185
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,652
聪明的小子
Smart kid.

186
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,745
那你知道我会变成什么人吗？
So you know who I'm going to be?

187
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,334
罗马人
The Roman.

188
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,626
真聪明
Very smart.

189
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,839
你让我想起我的儿子
You remind me of my boy.

190
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,417
你父亲救了我一命
Your pop saved my life.

191
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,715
我想我们就是一家人了
I guess that makes us family.

192
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,883
这从你的口袋掉出来
It fell out of your pocket.

193
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,052
这是我的保险
My insurance policy.

194
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,311
外面有很多坏人
There's a lot of bad people out there.

195
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,355
罪犯
Criminals.

196
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,609
大家都知道罪犯很迷信
And everybody knows criminals are superstitious.

197
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,397
有时脱离困境
Sometimes all it takes to get out of a bad situation

198
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,073
只需要掷一枚硬币
is a good flip of the coin.

199
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,276
今天晚上对你没有用吗？
It didn't work for you tonight?

200
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:55,989
是啊
Yeah.

201
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,500
不过  人多力量大
Still, two heads are better than one.

202
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,414
不是吗？
No?

203
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,547
留着吧  孩子
Keep it, kid.

204
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,925
种什么因  得什么果
All we get is all we take.

205
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,183
托马斯·韦恩把路易吉·马洛尼的子弹
I was eight when Dr. Thomas Wayne pulled Luigi maroni's bullets

206
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,510
从法尔康尼胸口取出的时候  我八岁
out of Falcone's chest.

207
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,603
不到一年  我父亲便死于暴徒手下
My father was dead by a mobster's hand within a year.

208
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,195
我们家和罗马人之间的关系  也从那时就断了
Any connection between my family and the Roman died then, too.

209
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:33,071
谢谢两位来一趟  如果没别的事…
Thank you for stopping by. If there's nothing else...

210
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,033
先生们  上面写的名字和住址
Gentlemen, these are the names and addresses for those who can account

211
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,493
都和韦恩少爷那一晚的行踪有关
for master Wayne's whereabouts on the night in question.

212
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,211
上面的名字不少  那天晚上一定很盛大吧
A lot of names on here. Must have been quite a night.

213
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,294
是啊  有个男的被杀了
Yes, well, a man was murdered.

214
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,514
希望两位的单位能还给他
Let us hope your respective offices can deliver for him

215
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,805
当年托马斯和玛莎·韦恩得不到的正义
the justice still denied Thomas and Martha Wayne.

216
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,270
他们的遭遇是一场悲剧
What happened to them was a tragedy.

217
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,233
所以你的老板更该离法尔康尼这种人远一点
And all the more reason why your boss should stay away from men like Falcone.

218
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,945
能不能哪一天父亲的罪孽
Will there ever be a time when the sins of fathers

219
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,148
不需再靠他们的儿子来偿还？
don't fall to their sons for redemption?

220
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,404
再见
Good day.

221
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,033
他们会监视我今天所有行动
They're going to be watching my every move today

222
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,663
确认我不是凶手
to confirm that I'm not the killer.

223
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,831
所以你会待在家了？
Then you'll be staying in?

224
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,124
不  记得搞定不在场证明
No, just pay off some more alibis.

225
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,631
我得去工作了
I have to go to work.

226
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,646
坐好
Sit tight.

227
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,020
如果他知道我们两个的关系  他会气死的
If he knew about us, it would kill him.

228
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,906
我会待在这里  亲爱的
I'll be right here, love.

229
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,337
你最爱的西西里岛卷饼
Your favorite cannolis.

230
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:13,251
卷饼啊  Cannolo是1个cannoli是1盒
Cannoli. Cannolo for one, cannoli for a box.

231
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,423
你的意大利语好烂
Your Italian is sterco.

232
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,509
我知道  爸爸  抱歉
I know, papa. I'm sorry.

233
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,262
你在父亲节带西西里岛卷饼来  我原谅你了
You bring cannoli on father's day, I forgive.

234
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,510
坐吧
Sit.

235
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,766
所以…
So...

236
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,602
和法尔康尼的战争快烦死我们了  爸爸
This war with Falcone, it's killing us, pop.

237
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,896
卡麦认为我们和那个假日杀手有关系
Carmine thinks we've got something to do with this holiday jerk.

238
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,447
胡说八道
Sciocchezze.

239
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,693
卡麦的妄想症跟假日杀手无关
Carmine's paranoia is not to do with holiday

240
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,323
而是跟新任检察官有关
but with the new DA.

241
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,539
除非这两个人是同一人
Unless these two are one and the same.

242
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,121
丹特是一位斗士
Dent's a crusader

243
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,248
但我不认为他会弄脏自己的手
but I can't see him getting his hands dirty.

244
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,747
蝙蝠侠还比较有可能
More likely the bat.

245
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,508
想听建议吗？
You want advice?

246
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:59,965
无论输赢  只有和平才能结束战争
Win or lose, the only thing that ends war is peace.

247
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,888
和卡麦和解？
Make peace with carmine?

248
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,100
爸爸…
Papa...

249
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,771
我不知道
I don't know.

250
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,016
我不…
I don't...

251
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,440
爸爸！
Papa!

252
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,073
爸爸！
Papa!

253
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,303
萨尔！
Sall

254
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,392
我听到枪声
I heard a gunshot.

255
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,266
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

256
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,393
怎么回事？
What happened?

257
00:27:31,174 --> 00:27:35,553
（阿尔贝托·法尔康尼）
（挚爱的儿子）

258
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,417
奇怪的谈生意地点
Strange place to do business.

259
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,886
我想这是那群条子唯一想不到你会来的地方
Guessing it's the last spot the pigs leave you alone these days.

260
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,377
加班吗？
Working late?

261
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,012
你是怎么通过保安的？
How the hell did you get through security?

262
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,304
你当时就在他身边  对吗？
You were with him, right?

263
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,686
我必须结束这场和法尔康尼家族之间愚蠢的战争
I needed to put an end to the stupid war with the falcones.

264
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:02,029
我父亲的遗言是  我应该和敌人握手言和
My father's last words to me were that I should make peace with my enemy.

265
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,691
起初我以为他说的是卡麦…
At first I thought he meant carmine...

266
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,784
但是路易吉·马洛尼绝不会希望这么做
But Luigi maroni would have never wanted that.

267
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,081
那他只有可能是另外一个意思了  所以…
There's only one other thing he could have meant, so...

268
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,590
我来和执法者和解  谈条件
I'm here to make peace with the law. Cut a deal.

269
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,757
你想抓到法尔康尼  我有很多他的把柄
You want Falcone and I got plenty on him.

270
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,393
足以让他永远吃牢饭
Enough to put him away for good.

271
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,272
你的交换条件是…
In exchange for...

272
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,355
撤销针对我和我手下的逮捕令
Dropping all outstanding warrants against me and my men.

273
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,900
你想抓到法尔康尼？
You want Falcone?

274
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,904
条件就是这样  要不要随便你
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

275
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,451
这样吧  掷到人头  我就接受
Tell you what, heads, I'll take it.

276
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,067
我原本以为新年的意外后  很少人会来这里
I expected a low turnout after the new year's fiasco.

277
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,199
-但这样真的很可悲  -我还好
- But this is really pathetic.  - Fine by me.

278
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,327
愈多人待在家  我工作愈轻松
The more people stay home, the easier my job gets.

279
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,952
说到工作变轻松  你真的逮到马洛尼了？
Speaking of jobs getting easier, is it true you got maroni?

280
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,829
还没结束
It's not a done deal.

281
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,293
我的办公室正在处理细节
My office is working out the details now.

282
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,837
但如果老萨尔把他跟我说的都告诉法官…
But if old sal tells a judge what he's told me...

283
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,144
那么可以说今天是罗马人
Let's just say today's a good day for the Roman

284
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,547
庆祝他所剩不多自由的好日子
to celebrate what's left of his freedom.

285
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,217
说曹操  曹操到
Speak of the devil.

286
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,610
难得看你假日在外面晃
I'm surprised to find you outdoors on a holiday.

287
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,483
-丹特  -法尔康尼
- Dent.  - Falcone.

288
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,820
其实我指的是你太太…  丹特太太
Actually, I was speaking to your wife... Mrs. dent.

289
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:15,915
别碰她
Don't touch her.

290
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,083
没想到你是位爱国人士  卡麦
I never took you for a patriot, carmine.

291
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,504
我绝对不会错过这么盛大的烟火的
I wouldn't miss fireworks like this for all the world.

292
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,584
晚安  丹特太太  队长
Good evening, Mrs. dent, captain.

293
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,468
晚安
Evening.

294
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,222
哈维  我跟你说  若是可以
I tell you, harv, if I could,

295
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,399
我今晚会安排所有警察到这里来
I'd have every cop in the city here tonight.

另一头见了
See you on the other side.

{\an8}（高谭银行）

299
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,903
大笨蛋被敲昏了脑袋
Utter inanity proved his insanity

300
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,660
证明了他有多不正常
while he rattled a couple of bones.

301
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,053
我一直在想这件事  也许你是对的
I've been thinking about it and maybe you're right.

302
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,250
什么事？
Uh, about what?

303
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,308
生儿育女
Having kids.

304
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,277
退开
Stay down.

305
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,576
去找高登  我马上回来
Get to Gordon. I'll be back.

306
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,617
哈维  不  哈维！
Harvey, no. Harvey!

307
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,605
走开
Get out of here.

308
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,433
等我搞清楚这个人渣为什么要杀我再说
Not till I know why this scumbag is trying to kill me.

309
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,108
要是我想杀你  你早就挂了
If I was trying to kill you, you'd be dead already.

310
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,612
那你为什么…
Then what are you...

311
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,747
够了
That's enough.

312
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,999
有人想挑衅你  丹特
Someone's trying to provoke you, dent.

313
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,671
挑衅我做什么？
Into doing what?

314
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,842
好问题…
Good question...

315
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,618
起来
Get up.

316
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,696
“海象和木匠
"The walrus and the carpenter

一起散着步
Were walking close at hand.

318
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:21,343
他们看到大片沙滩  悲从中来
They wept like anything to see such quantities of sand.

319
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,716
‘如果七名女仆拿着七支拖把打扫整整半年’
'If seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year,

320
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,725
海象说  ‘你觉得她们能打扫干净吗？’”
do you suppose, ' the walrus said, 'that they could get it clear?"

321
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,436
我很怀疑
I doubt it.

322
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,981
到了
There.

323
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,401
暂时存放点
That's the drop.

324
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,824
至于蝙蝠侠
As for the bat,

325
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:55,206
把他送来不是说好的一部分
delivering him wasn't part of the deal.

326
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:59,627
所以我们想对他做什么都可以
So we can do whatever we want with him.

327
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:03,752
多好玩
What fun.

328
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,353
一闪一闪小蝙蝠
Twinkle, twinkle little bat.

329

满天都是你的影…

你和罗马人的合作  就在今晚结束

不

Dent. All right, let me be clear.

340
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,349
这个怪胎不准再骚扰我们家  不准！
This freak is done terrorizing my family. Done!

341
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,595
你指望我们相信一位备受尊敬的公仆…
You expect us to believe that a respected public servant...

342
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,520
我不懂你为什么要看那种垃圾节目
I don't know why you watch that garbage.

343
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:39,608
是真的吗？
Is it true?

344
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:43,022
你相信她的鬼话？  所以你才想离婚？
You believe this bs? Is that why you want a divorce?

345
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,481
我没这么说过
I never said that.

346
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,320
我一直说的是治疗
I have been talking about therapy.

347
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,154
也许离婚不是坏事  既然你无法回到他身边
Maybe divorce isn't so bad, now that you can't go back to him.

忘恩负义的贱人
Ungrateful bitch.

349

抱歉  我不知道我为什么这么说
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

350

我要赶不上出庭了
I'm going to be late for court.

351

你又没关地下室的门了
You left the basement door open again.

我问你是否准备好了  丹特先生

他在这里  队长  屋顶上

是的  抱歉  庭上
Uh, yes, yes. Sorry, your honor.

367
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,069
有必要到屋顶上吗？
Rooftop really necessary?

368
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,196
我以为你想要私人空间
I thought you'd want privacy.

369

哈维在法庭上快失控了
Harvey's starting to lose it down there.

I think all this holiday speculation in the press is finally getting to...

371
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,991
私人空间？
Privacy?

怎么了？
Why?

373
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,411
你在哪里找到的？
Where'd you find them?

374
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,833
你不会喜欢答案的
You're not going to like it.

375
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:14,507
没错  我杀了法兰基加佐和他的兄弟蓝尼
Uh, yeah. I hit Frankie gazzo and his brother Lenny.

376
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,383
把他们的尸体扔进高谭河
Tossed their bodies in the Gotham river.

377

你正在找的聪明人都在那里面
Lots of wise guys you're looking for are in there.

378

也许我是因为这样才有溃疡  毕竟喝了那里的水
Maybe that's why I got an ulcer. You know, from drinking the water.

379
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,647
你不是依照罗马人  卡麦·法尔康尼的直接指示
And didn't you commit these murders and felonies

380
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,856
犯下这些谋杀和重罪吗？
under direct orders from carmine "the Roman" Falcone?

重罪？不  那家伙是圣人
Felonies? Nah, guy's a Saint.

Now, Mr. maroni, may I remind you that your immunity

387
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,195
你必须在诉讼过程诚实证言  才能取得豁免权
is contingent upon your truthful testimony during these proceedings.

388
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,865
我说的是事实啊  法尔康尼非常清白
And I told you the truth. Falcone is clean as a whistle.

Sal, what are you doing?

好吧
Okay.

Um, your honor, in light of the witness's...

393

背叛！
Double cross!

394
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,472
改变主意  我请求延期审理
Change of heart, I need to request a continuance.

395
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:48,472
延期审理？ 那是什么意思？ 等于放假吗？
Continuance? Uh, what is that? Like, uh, a holiday?

396
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,144
-什么？  -假日
- What?  - Holiday.

00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,719
抱歉  没人告诉你  哈维
I'm sorry no one told you, harv.

415
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,683
告诉我什么？
Told me what?

416
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,981
你已经死了
You're dead.

417
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,610
我得接这通电话
I have to take this.

418
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,286
喂？
Yeanh.

419
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,660
现在？
Now?

420
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,668
不  时机正好
No, it's the perfect time.

421
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,248
医生说他几天后就没事了  别担心
The doctor says he'll be fine  in a few days. Don't worry.

422
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,175
天啊！
Oh, my god!

423
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,717
他不见了
He's gone.

424
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,427
封锁出口  他走不远的  走吧！
Secure the exits. He couldn't have gotten far. Let's go!

425
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,327
这是哪里…
Well, where is...

426
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,291
我猜猜  你决定还是不来了
Let me guess. You're not coming after all.

427
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:18,963
恐怕是的
Afraid not.

428
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,838
是啊  你不是会弄脏自己手的人
Yeah. You're not really one to get your hands dirty.

429
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,452
你对我一无所知
You know nothing about me.

430
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:29,015
我知道你是骗子  小偷  杀人犯
I know you're a liar, a thief, a murderer.

431
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:30,808
我是一位父亲
A father.

432
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,314
-胆小鬼  -再见了  丹特
- A coward.  - Goodbye, dent.

433
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:42,736
好吧
Fine.

434
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,280
他想跟你谈谈
He wants to talk to you.

435
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,780
快点
Come on.

436
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,271
快点！
Come on!

437
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,204
有没有搞错？
Really?

438
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,130
我不是在针对你  公事公办
It's not personal. It's business.

439
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,068
生日快乐  爸爸！
Happy birthday, papal!

440
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,405
好了  来吹蜡烛吧
All right, here we go.

441
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,495
很愉快的一晚  谢谢各位
What a wonderful night. Thank you.

442
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,463
今年不太顺利
This year has been a trying one.

443
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,634
虽然我们尚未全面瓦解
And while we have yet to fully dismantle

444
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,463
针对我们的司法邪恶机器
the vicious machine
the law has set against us,

445
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,182
我们依然让他们吃了鳖
you might say we put a dent in it.

446
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:46,027
敬苏菲亚法尔康尼  是我们和马洛尼和解的功臣
To Sofia Falcone, for brokering the peace with maroni.

447
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,781
非常感谢
Mille grazie.

448
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,571
还有我美丽的姊妹卡拉
And my beautiful sister, Carla.

449
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,162
她在哪里？
Where is she?

450
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,657
卡拉？
Carla?

451
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,826
也许还有很多电视专访要忙
Probably more TV interviews.

452
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,923
别这样  这些专访很有效
Now, now. Those interviews helped.

453
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,925
我想她的未来指日可待
I think she's got a future.

454
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,242
抱歉吓到你
Sorry to startle you.

455
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,375
你不是应该在找哈维吗？
Shouldn't you be looking for Harvey?

456
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,415
我问了几位伙伴  缩小了他的位置范围
I'm narrowing down his location by interviewing known associates.

457
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,586
几位伙…喔
Known associ... oh...

458
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,471
你这是在浪费时间
Well, you're wasting your time.

459
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,093
那个男人是一团谜  至少看起来是这样
The man's a mystery. Or so it would seem.

460
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,142
你有注意到他最近的行为  出现变化吗？
Did you notice any recent changes in his behavior?

461
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,765
情绪波动？
Mood swings?

462
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,772
每天都跟法尔康尼那种人打交道
Is that so strange when you deal with people

463
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,273
能不激动吗？
like Falcone every day?

464
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,320
哈维从没提过他是牛津毕业的
Harvey never mentioned he went to Oxford.

465
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,121
很重要吗？
Is it important?

466
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,376
也许吧
Maybe.

467
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,836
感觉你不是单纯为了公事而来
This doesn't feel like just a job for you.

468
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,707
是私事  怎么了吗？
It's personal. Why?

469
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,544
他是我朋友  他需要我帮忙
He's my friend, and he needs help.

470
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,618
晚餐时间到了吗？
Dinner time already?

471
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,416
所罗门格兰迪
"Solomon grundy,

472
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,749
星期一出生…
born on a Monday..."

473
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,417
星期二受洗  星期三结婚
"Christened on a Tuesday, married on a Wednesday,

474
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:19,676
星期四生病  星期五病危
I'll on Thursday, worse on Friday,

475
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,804
星期六死亡
died on Saturday."

476
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,260
星期日埋葬
"Buried on Sunday."

477
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,018
那就是他的最后
That was the end.

478
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,318
星期一出生
"Born on a Monday."

479
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:43,700
重生  复活
Reborn, resurrected.

480
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,870
就在星期一
On a Monday.

481
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,743
那说的是你的经历吗？
Is that what happened to you?

482
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,413
你死而复生吗？
Did you die and come back?

483
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,845
一个人能过双面生活吗？
Can a man live two lives?

484
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:03,675
星期一出生
Born on a Monday.

485
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,852
星期一出生
Born on a Monday.

486
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,945
九月有三十天
Thirty days hath September.

487
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,945
但今天让你最困扰
But today's the one that troubles you the most.

488
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,954
他在哪里？
Where is he?

489
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:27,952
已经好几个月了
It's been months.

490
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,914
我很想你
I've missed you.

491
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:35,464
被攻击重伤的检察官  从医院消失
The da who was attacked and maimed before vanishing from the hospital.

492
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,011
嗯  他还是老样子
Hmm, he does that.

493
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,918
后来当晚  卡拉维提
Later that night, Carla viti,

494
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,426
她曾公开指控丹特是假日杀手
who'd publicly accused dent of being holiday,

495
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,007
在前往兄弟的生日派对途中被杀害
was killed on her way to her brother's birthday party.

496
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,761
我知道  真惨啊
I know. Wasn't that terrible?

497
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,812
我觉得她说得对
I think she was right.

498
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,893
你当然觉得了
Of course you do.

499
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,732
似乎每个紧咬丹特的人  最后都死了
It seems everyone who comes after dent winds up dead.

500
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:01,236
我们必须在哈维再杀人之前找到他
We need to find Harvey before he kills again.

501
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,450
你知道些什么？
What do you know?

502
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:09,707
高登和他的人每天都到这里问我同样的问题
Gordon and his men have been here day after day asking the same thing.

503
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,785
我把我跟队长说的告诉你吧
I'll tell you what I told the captain.

504
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,665
让我走出这里  我就不再杀人
Let me walk out of here and I'll stop the killing.

505
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:20,710
没什么好谈的了
We're done.

506
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,932
今天是劳动节
It's labor day.

507
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,186
如果模式不变
And, if the pattern holds,

508
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:35,733
我相信你身上有假日杀手想要的东西
I believe you have something holiday wants.

509
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,481
在阿特沃往北走
Head north on atwell.

510
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,448
-长官  监狱在南边…  -我知道在哪里
- Sir, the penitentiary is south...  - I know where it is.

511
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:47,161
这是我见过
最漫长该死的囚犯转移
This is the longest goddamn
prisoner transfer I've ever seen.

512
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,282
看来你们很喜欢我啊
Guess you guys
just can't get enough of me.

513
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:40,425
丹特！
Dent!

514
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,253
你还活着？
You're alive?

515
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:45,211
他不再是这场行动的负责人
He's no longer running this operation.

516
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,759
好吧
All right.

517
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,303
够了
That's enough.

518
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,681
别激动  吉姆  我不是来杀马洛尼的
Relax, Jim, I'm not here to kill maroni.

519
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:59,187
我是来感谢他给我一个全新的…面貌
I'm here to thank him for giving me a new... outlook.

520
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,644
噢  天啊
Oh, my god.

521
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,487
哈维…
Harvey...

522
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:08,405
不得不说  吉姆  你的枪正好派上用场
I have to tell you, jimbo, your gun has come in handy.

523
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,327
我知道你是给哈维的  但他的身体我说了算
I know it was meant for Harvey, but possession is nine-tenths.

524
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,998
如果你不是哈维  那你是谁？
If you're not Harvey, then, who are you?

525
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,913
假日杀手？
Holiday?

526
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,336
我们在你家地下室找到了枪枝
We found the guns in your basement.

527
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,469
你在我家地下室发现枪枝？
You found the guns in my basement?

528
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,135
当然了
Of course.

529
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,637
我们都知道了
We know everything.

530
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,796
我们只想帮助你
We just wanna take you to get help.

531
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:38,063
我认为托马斯韦恩当年
查到了什么
I think Thomas Wayne was onto something.

532
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,558
你用你的方式是打不倒他们的  吉姆
You can't beat 'em, jimbo, not your way.

533
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:43,694
你得先加入他们
Join 'em first.

534
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,652
用他们的条件击败他们
Then beat 'em on their own terms.

535
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,988
正面  你死定了
Heads, you die.

536
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,097
由你决定  哈维
It is up to you, Harvey.

537
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,291
你我都很清楚  那枚硬币两面都是正面
You and I know that both sides of that coin are heads.

538
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,793
你怎么能…
How the hell could you...

539
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,919
一身劲装哦  蝙蝠侠
Oh, nice outfit, bats.

540
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,843
我想这个小陷阱是你的主意
I suppose this little trap was your idea.

541
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,603
马上把枪放下！
Drop the gun, now!

542
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,036
不！
Nol

543
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,094
好了  格兰迪  快走
Come on, grundy, move your ass.

544
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:07,444
我想我们回到原点了
I think we're back to square one.

545
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,210
你起来得真早
Ah, you're up early.

546
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,128
嗯？
Hmm?

547
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,509
不  我刚回来
Oh, no, I just got in.

548
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,972
当然了  那我想你该休息了
Of course. Then I suppose it's off to bed with you.

549
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,671
-有什么需要帮忙的吗？  -怎么会发生这种事  阿福？
- Is there something I can help...  - How did it happen, Alfred?

550
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,193
他们是被迫和法尔康尼家族合作吗？
Were they forced into business with the falcones?

551
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,740
还是他们一心想受世人尊敬  而选择和魔鬼合作？
Or were they so set on building a legacy that they'd work with the devil himself?

552
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:07,542
你父母相信看任何事都有两种角度…
Your parents believed that there are two ways to look at everything...

553
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:11,584
看任何人也一样
And everyone.

554
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:15,136
只有两种吗？
Only two?

555
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,463
他们当时还年轻
They were young.

556
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:21,097
两个很棒的人  住在很险恶的环境
Two exceptionally good people living in an exceptionally bad place,

557
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,344
试图改善生活
trying to make it better.

558
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,563
但是法尔康尼呢？
But Falcone?

559
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,973
他们难道不知道承认他
Didn't they know that by legitimizing him,

560
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,900
就等于成了打造怪物的帮凶？
they were helping to make a monster?

561
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,195
他们做出许多艰难决定  也犯下不少错误
They made difficult choices and more than a few mistakes.

562
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,691
但他们愿意补偿他们
But they were willing to pay for them.

563
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:41,530
我一直告诉自己  我做的事是为了让他们自豪
I've always told myself that I'm doing what I do to honor them.

564
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:46,836
若是我做的事  其实是替他们补偿呢？
What does it mean if deep down, I'm really doing it to redeem them?

565
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,882
我想那意味着你父母  会为他们真正的遗产…
I think it means your parents would be proud...

566
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,752
深感自豪
Of their real legacy.

567
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:06,559
太荒谬了
This is absurd.

568
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,560
抱歉打扰了  女士  但今天是万圣节
Sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am, but it's Halloween.

569
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,065
丹特先生还没落网
Mr. dent is still at large.

570
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,021
高登队长命令我们在这待命
And captain Gordon ordered us
to be here.

571
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,191
所以你得跟我们困在这里了
So you're stuck with us.

572
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,151
你们扣留了我的车
You've blocked in my car.

573
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,956
我们非常乐意载你到你要去的地方
We're more than happy to drive you anywhere you need to go.

574
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,829
虽然你待在家里对我们来说会比较轻松
Though you'll be making our jobs a lot easier if you remain indoors.

575
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,745
目前没有办法得知你丈夫在哪里  或何时会出现
There's no way to know where or when your husband will show up.

576
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,172
我丈夫死了
My husband is dead.

577
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,091
抱歉  女士  但那不是事实
I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's not true.

578
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,013
是真的
Yes, it is.

579
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,534
醒醒  朱利安
Wake up, Julian.

580
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,029
你知道今天是什么日子
You know what today is.

581
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,247
是万圣节前夜…
It's all hallows' Eve...

582
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,460
十月的第三十一天…
The 31st day of the tenth month...

583
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:21,339
还有这个悲惨闰年的第305天
And the 305th of this miserable leap year.

584
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,425
还有呢？
And?

585
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,264
塔可星期二
Taco Tuesday.

586
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,524
非常好
Muy bueno.

587
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,935
搞什么？
“What the hell?

588
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,882
不给糖就捣蛋
Trick or treat.

589
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,841
正大光明攻击我们…
Attacking us like that out in the open...

590
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,143
不符合凶手侧写
It didn't fit the profile.

591
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,059
那就是职业杀手了
So it was a hired gun.

592
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,438
我们看到丹特和假日杀手同时出现在同一地点
We see dent and holiday in the same place at the same time,

593
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,487
这么一来  检察官就有不在场证明
and, just like that, the da's got himself an alibi.

594
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,615
哈维是牛津毕业的吗？
Did Harvey study at Oxford?

595
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,908
跟法尔康尼的儿子一样？
Like Falcone's boy?

596
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,662
我知道你是怎么想的  但别让哈维听到你这么说
I see where you're going but don't let Harvey hear you say it.

597
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,372
他是高谭大学毕业的
He's a Gotham u man.

598
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,286
立场坚定的夜鹰
A dyed-in-the-wool nighthawk.

599
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,460
别太担心了
Don't get hung up on it.

600
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,414
还没查证所有线索
Not every lead checks out.

601
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,964
我们已经有足够证据能破案了
And we already have what we need to make our case.

602
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:41,831
（哈维丹特）

603
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,008
很难相信那个站在这个屋顶
It's hard to believe the man who stood on this roof

604
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:47,591
和我们一起做出承诺的人
and made that promise, that bond with each of us,

605
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:48,971
会越了界
would cross the line.

606
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:51,307
你真的认为那个在后巷的人
Can you honestly say that man

607
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,309
跟我们认识的是同一人吗？
and the one we met in the alley were the same?

608
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,227
他身上有深深的伤痕…
There are deep scars there...

609
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,184
我指的不是他的脸
And I'm not talking about his face.

610
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,446
如果你觉得我们想错了  就找出证据
If you think we're wrong, find the evidence.

611
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,825
但现在拯救生命
But, for now, the best way to save lives,

612
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,740
还有拯救哈维最好的方式  就是把他带回来
including Harvey's, is to bring him in.

613
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,063
你知道我身边的人  都怎么称呼过去这一年吗？
Do you know what my people call this past year?

614
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,520
“漫长的万圣节”
The long Halloween.

615
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,561
我的侄子
My nephew,

616
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,273
我儿子  我姊妹
my son, my sister,

617
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,608
我半数手下
half my men.

618
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,331
为什么？
Why?

619
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,790
丹特为什么会想杀了你儿子？
Why would dent kill your son?

620
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,047
但愿我有机会做一个更好的父亲
I wish I had the chance to be a better father to my boy.

621
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,005
但我们天人永隔了
We will never see each other again.

622
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:07,500
关于这件事…

623
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,385
我很…
I am so...

624
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,846
抱歉
So sorry.

625
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,317
我们这种人有一个规矩
There is a rule among my kind.

626
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,812
不让太太牵扯其中
We leave the wives out of it.

627
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,366
但是丹特没照我们的规矩来
But dent does not play by our rules.

628
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:33,622
若是那样  就会有人没命
And when that happens, people die.

629
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,744
谁的太太？
Whose wives?

630
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,708
我想正义真的是盲目的
I guess justice really is blind.

631
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,637
爸爸
Papa.

632
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,891
一切都没事  苏菲亚  我只是…绊倒了
Everything is fine, Sofia. I just... stumbled.

633
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,398
没必要那么做
That wasn't necessary.

634
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,991
也许不是
Maybe not.

635
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,324
你打算告诉我你为什么对他们穷追不舍吗？
Are you going to tell me why you're so obsessed with them?

636
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:31,429
我一直没谢谢你那天晚上找到我  送我回家
I never thanked you for finding me and getting me home that night.

637
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,849
你以为我是你母亲
You thought I was your mother.

638
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,426
稻草人的恐惧毒素
Scarecrow's fear toxin.

639
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:43,016
你找到我的地方  正是我失去她的地方
Where you found me is where I lost her.

640
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,486
我甚至不知道我妈叫什么名字
I don't even know my mother's name.

641
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:55,120
但我想有人可以告诉我
But I think there's someone who can tell me.

642
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,747
你父亲
Your father.

643
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,003
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

644
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:09,092
当那一刻到来  我不确定我有那个勇气开口问
When the time comes, I'm not sure I'll have it in me to ask.

645
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:14,465
这座城市有谁的家庭是正常的吗？
Is there even such a thing as a normal family in this city?

646
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,341
也许没有…
Maybe not...

647
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,347
对我们这种人来说
For people like us.

648
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:33,901
那是什么？
What the hell is that?

649
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,453
该死！
Oh, shit!

650
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,247
所有单位  至第六街和梅森街10之33转角处
All units, 10-33 at the corner of 6th and Mason.

651
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,258
能出动的单位请回答
All available units respond.

652
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,594
不行  队长说我们不能离开  今晚不行
No, captain said we don't leave for anything, not tonight.

653
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:29,089
老爸  是告密者
Pop goes the weasel

654
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,552
来吧  孩子们
Keep coming, boys.

655
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:38,556
所有人都能参加这个派对
Everyone's invited to this party.

656
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,597
不是所有人
Not everyone.

657
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,939
正面
Heads.

658
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,817
我说的是正面！
I meant heads!

659
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,073
苏菲亚  好了  我没事
Sofia, please. It was nothing.

660
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,697
别把我当老头子看待
Stop treating me like an old man.

661
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,533
你不老
You're not old.

662
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,462
也许我的确老了
Maybe I am.

663
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,047
至少在这一行太老了
Too old for this business, at least.

664
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:20,632
你有…你母亲的消息吗？
Have you... heard from your mother?

665
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,263
她很爱你
She loves you.

666
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,686
她只是不喜欢这里
Just not this place.

667
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,557
这里就代表我
This place is me.

668
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:34,688
我知道你这么想  也许以前是这样没错
I know you think that, and maybe at one time it was.

669
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,360
但很多事都变了
But things have changed,

670
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:38,946
面目全非…
so much...

671
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,403
就在短时间内
So fast.

672
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:43,830
我不也跟他们一样改变了吗？
Haven't I changed with them?

673
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:46,916
是啊  你变了
Yes, you have.

674
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,791
但当你崭露头角  妈妈也还在这里的时候
But when you were coming up, when mama was here,

675
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:54,124
你绝不会想到要雇用毒藤女和稻草人这些怪胎
you wouldn't have thought to hire freaks like poison Ivy and scarecrow.

676
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,427
这些人…
These... people,

677
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,304
他们难以掌握  爸爸
they're not stable, papa.

678
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,017
时代变了
Times change.

679
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,101
老大！
Boss!

680
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,978
楼下出了事
Something's wrong downstairs.

681
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:11,979
警察跑了
The cops took off

682
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,061
我们无法联系上任何成员
and we can't get any of our guys on the comm.

683
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:15,607
马洛…
Maron...

684
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,734
苏菲亚  不！
Sofia, no!

685
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,538
来啊  你们这群混…
Come on, you mother...

686
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,312
苏菲亚！
Sofia

687
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,644
这是怎样？
What is this?

688
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,779
审判日
Judgment day.

689
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,146
我们在下水道追丢他们
We lost them in the sewers.

690
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,620
你说得对  那是为了分散我们的注意力
You're right. This was meant to distract us.

691
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,583
是啊  但分散我们的注意力干嘛？
Yeah, but distract us from what?

692
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,836
我真的要感谢你  卡麦
I really owe it all to you,
carmine.

693
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:49,261
你教我所有人都是有罪的…
You've taught me
that all men are guilty...

694
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,765
都是无辜的
And innocent.

695
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,473
这让正义不过就像掷硬币这么简单
Which makes justice nothing more than the flip of a coin.

696
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,859
结果是难以预料的
The outcome unpredictable.

697
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:02,604
也就是说…
That is, of course...

698
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:09,027
除非体制腐化  操纵对自己有利的事
Unless the system is corrupted, rigged in a man's favor.

699
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,239
白天是正当的生意人和慈善家
Legit businessman/philanthropist by day.

700
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:17,369
晚上是勒索犯和杀人犯
Criminal racketeer, murderer by night.

701
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,373
你操纵了你的事业
You've rigged every game you've ever played

702
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,254
和你的家族里的所有牌局
in your business and your family.

703
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:28,425
真的只要微调
It's really the most minor of adjustments,

704
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,888
改变一点外貌  就能决定你…
a small change of outlook that decides if you live...

705
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,261
是否能活下去
Or not.

706
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,612
你开枪啊
Just pull the fucking trigger.

707
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:48,984
你没听清楚
You haven't listened.

708
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:53,701
如果你听清楚  卡麦  你就会第一次明白
If you had, you'd understand that for the first time, carmine,

709
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,581
决定权并不在我
it really isn't up to me.

710
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:57,537
祝你好运
Good luck.

711
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:06,970
不！
No!

712
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:08,150
看招  你这个虚伪的小人…
En garde, you sanctimonious shit...

713
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,356
噢！
Ow!

714
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,840
南西  让打进来的人稍等
Nancy, hold all my calls.

715
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:31,169
我得干掉一个人
I have to terminate someone.

716
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:51,825
哈维  住手！
Harvey, don't!

717
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,055
终于只剩下你和我了
Alone at last.

718
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,767
让我帮你解脱吧
Now let's get you out of all this.

719
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:40,572
退后
Stay back.

720
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:52,424
哈维
Harvey.

721
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,252
你不需要这么做
You don't have to do this.

722
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,430
哈维  哈维  哈维
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey.

723
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,516
你看不出来我改头换面了吗  蝙蝠侠？
Can't you see I'm a new man, bats?

724
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,718
我终于觉醒了
I'm finally awake.

725
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,392
不像哈维丹特
And unlike Harvey dent,

726
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:08,850
我不用对复仇这种没用的动机负责
I'm not beholden to petty motives like revenge,

727
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:12,358
或是糟糕的升职
or worse, career advancement.

728
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:14,481
我的重担已经卸下
A weight has been lifted.

729
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:19,618
我不需要再决定谁无罪和谁有罪
I don't have to decide who's innocent and who's guilty anymore.

730
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:24,578
我只需要…执行
All I have to do... is execute.

731
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:30,715
-有罪  -不！
- Guilty.  - No!

732
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,336
不！
No!

733
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:46,266
爸爸
Papa.

734
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:48,858
苏菲亚  不！
Sofia, no!

735
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,031
只有两颗子弹
Two bullets only.

736
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,950
抱歉了  美女
Sorry, gorgeous.

737
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:04,914
不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

738
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:17,801
苏菲亚
Sofia.

739
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:24,593
我…我撑不住了
I can't... I can't hold on.

740
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:04,803
露易莎？
Louisa?

741
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,183
露易莎？
Louisa.

742
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,694
赛琳娜
Selina.

743
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,199
赛琳娜？
Selina?

744
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,652
我帮你
Let me help you.

745
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:23,947
不
No.

746
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,573
不
No.

747
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:30,036
种什么因  得什么果
All we get is all we take.

748
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,035
你还是这么认为吗？
Do you still believe?

749
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:35,546
对
Yes.

750
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:36,839
依然如此
I do.

751
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,091
很好
Good.

752
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,288
-哈维？
-不再是了
- Harvey?
- Not anymore.

753
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,544
我必须这么做
It had to be done.

754
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:22,676
你永远无法说服我
You will never convince me of that.

755
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,430
以后不会再有收贿的法官
There won't be any judges to be bribed.

756
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,182
不会再有消失的证人
No witnesses to disappear.

757
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:33,646
罗马人死了  是双面人杀了他
The Roman is dead and two-face killed him.

758
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,646
漫长的万圣节…
The long Halloween...

759
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:39,821
已经结束了
Is over.

760
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:44,357
我们会帮助你
We'll get you help.

761
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:50,867
你们接下来才需要帮助
You're the ones who're gonna need help from now on.

762
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:53,957
哈维…
Harvey...

763
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:55,792
双面人…
Two-face...

764
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:57,881
随便吧
Whatever.

765
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,956
你背叛了你所有的信念
You betrayed everything you believe in.

766
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:02,962
并不是所有
Not everything.

767
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,132
逮捕我吧  吉姆
Arrest me, jimbo.

768
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,177
是我干的
I'm responsible.

769
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:17,769
不止法尔康尼  还有其他假日杀手犯下的案子
Not just for Falcone but all the holiday killings.

770
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:22,069
我必须面对审判
I have to face judgment.

771
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,702
代价
The cost.

772
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:39,295
我们一年前在这里立下承诺
The promise we made right here, one year ago,

773
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:43,127
要扳倒罗马人  结果…
to take down the Roman. In the end...

774
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:45,877
这么做值得吗？
Was it worth it?

775
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,425
他是在问好人是否赢了
He's asking if the good guys won.

776
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:52,383
是的  好人赢了
Yes, the good guys won.

777
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,853
但我们要过很久之后才知道
这么做值不值得
But we won't know for a very long time
if it was worth it.

778
01:19:07,812 --> 01:19:14,527
（阿卡姆精神病院）

779
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,258
吉尔达
Gilda.

780
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,199
必须这么做
It had to be done.

781
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:52,954
你很清楚
You know that.

782
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:57,160
就跟你早就知道哈维从没去过牛津大学念书一样
The same way you knew Harvey never went to Oxford.

783
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,367
是我
That was me.

784
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:01,462
嗯…
Well...

785
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:03,329
我和…
Me and...

786
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,503
阿尔贝托法尔康尼
Alberto Falcone.

787
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,469
你可以看到我们当时深爱彼此
If you could see how in love we were then.

788
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:13,884
我怀孕了
I was pregnant.

789
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:15,508
他没有半点犹豫
He didn't hesitate.

790
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,851
我们当天就结婚了
We were married that same day.

791
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,601
他是罗马人帝国的继承人
He was heir to the Roman empire.

792
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,476
他父亲绝不欢迎
And his father could never welcome into the family

793
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,778
婚前怀的小孩进入家族
a child conceived out of wedlock.

794
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:30,690
我试图对抗
I tried to fight.

795
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:34,277
但面对高谭市的教父  我有什么机会？
But what chance did I have opposite the godfather of Gotham?

796
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,581
在无视我的意愿下…
Against my will...

797
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:42,581
我们的婚约取消  而我们的孩子…
Our marriage was annulled and our child...

798
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,870
从我的子宫夺走
Ripped from my womb.

799
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:48,416
他们对我做的事…
What they did to me...

800
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,468
他们所采取的方式…
The way it was done...

801
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,467
让我整个崩溃了
Left me broken.

802
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:57,474
你曾想复仇
You wanted revenge.

803
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:01,811
我想要的是伸张正义
I wanted justice.

804
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,105
我来到高谭市  嫁给了
I came to Gotham and married the man

805
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,775
我认为最有可能替我伸张正义的人
I thought had the best chance of delivering it.

806
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:11,022
哈维和我实在是太相似了
Oh, Harvey and I were so much alike.

807
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:15,576
只是他的内心还没被整个剖开
Only what was inside him hadn't yet been ripped out.

808
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,989
这一点…很有用
That was... useful.

809
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,624
而且…
And...

810
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:27,295
一度也很有趣
Even fun for a time.

811
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,417
但他后来变得很忙  对抗他自己的敌人
But then he became so busy wrestling his own demon,

812
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:35,546
我则独自一人  扳倒我自己的敌人
I was left to take down mine all by myself.

813
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,433
一次假日
One holiday,

814
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:43,847
夺取一个家人
one twisted family snapshot at a time.

815
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,145
我对罗马人  或他儿子
I have no regrets about what I did to the Roman,

816
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,604
或是那个罪恶家族里的其他人所做的事
or his son,

817
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,945
完全不后悔
or anyone else in that godforsaken family.

818
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:58,819
但是哈维…
But Harvey...

819
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:01,659
到最后  我爱上了他
In the end, I loved him.

820
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:06,664
但不是全部的他
But not all of him.

821
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:09,997
所以…
So...

822
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:14,339
你要逮捕我  还是站在那里评判我？
Are you going to take me away or just stand there in judgment?

823
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,469
我需要知道  假日杀手已经收手了
I need to know that holiday is done.

824
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:22,768
不是收手…
Not done...

825
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,057
而是结束了
Finished.

826
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:36,073
我不禁想…  他从多久前就知道我的事了？
I wonder... How long did he know about me?

827
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,363
你是这样想通的吗？
Is that how you figured it out?

828
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,578
哈维有向你透露消息吗？
Did Harvey tip you off?

829
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,332
他并没有供出你
He didn't give you up.

830
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,285
据我所知没有
Not knowingly.

831
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,833
但马洛尼被杀害后
But after maroni was killed,

832
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:54,963
从他护航假日杀手的方式  他一定从那时就知道了
the way he protected holiday, he must have known then.

833
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:56,968
他是我的朋友
He was my friend.

834
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:58,966
他信任我
He believed in me.

835
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,007
我应该拯救他的
I should have saved him.

836
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,054
你现在打算怎么做？
What will you do now?

837
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,932
跟高登说？
Tell Gordon?

838
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,784
阿福？
Alfred.

839
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:29,956
真的假的？
Really?

840
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:33,539
我知道很晚了  少爷  但你永远预料不到
I know it's late, sir, but you never know.

841
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,423
跟晚不晚没关系  不会有人来跟我们讨糖吃
It doesn't matter how late it is. We don't get trick-or-treaters.

842
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:42,048
并非所有高谭市的家庭都跟你一样坚持
Not all Gotham families share your obstinate hope.

843
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:46,885
必须有更多好人试图改善这个世界
It's going to take a lot more good people trying to make things better

844
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,016
才能看到真正的改变
before we see real change.

845
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,775
你说了算  少爷
If you say so, sir.

846
01:23:58,408 --> 01:23:59,739
你犯错的时候真可爱
You're cute when you're wrong.

847
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,364
不给糖  就捣蛋
Trick or treat.

848
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,664
是找你的  少爷
It's for you, sir.
