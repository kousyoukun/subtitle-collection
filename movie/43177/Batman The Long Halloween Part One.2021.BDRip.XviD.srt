1
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,963
I only came here out of respect
for my parents who...

2
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,010
Knew your family.

3
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:04,141
Your father was more than just a friend
to my family.

4
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,190
That was a long time ago.

5
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:11,946
Yes.

6
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,655
A long time.

7
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,199
Thomas Wayne believed in my father.

8
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,700
He believed a man could bring order
to a world of chaos.

9
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,245
And you, Bruce?

10
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,049
I believe in Gotham city.

11
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,227
- You try the vongole?
- Mm. Delicious.

12
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,409
Oh. Hmm.

13
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,017
Master Bruce. Happy Halloween.

14
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,312
- Is there coffee?
- In the study, sir.

15
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,023
A miss Kyle telephoned.

16
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,902
She said she was checking the number
you gave her to make sure it's real.

17
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,365
The gates are open. We haven't
seen a trick-or-treater in years.

18
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,328
We won't see one tonight.

19
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,827
Hardly worth the security risk,
wouldn't you say?

20
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,040
Respectfully, sir,

21
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,496
if our security is dependent
on $600 worth of iron alloy...

22
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,879
This city is fallen, Alfred.

23
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,467
Then we must endeavor
to lift it up again, Bruce.

24
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,393
In the meantime,
we live in obstinate hope.

25
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,600
And an unlocked mansion.

26
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,821
Anyway...

27
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,396
It's an absurd holiday.

28
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,200
Oh, yes.
Putting on costumes and striking fear.

29
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,118
Quite absurd.

30
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,614
Do you really think...

31
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,209
I hate when he does that.

32
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,805
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

33
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,721
James, babs! No running!

34
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,061
Come on, guys, slow down.
You're gonna hurt yourselves.

35
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,349
They're excited, Jim. Big night.

36
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,152
Yeah. All right.
But we're taking the squad car.

37
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,820
Too many crazies out.

38
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,408
Sir!

39
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,289
Hang on.

40
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,337
Now, you're ready.

41
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,758
All right, who wants to drive?

42
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:52,972
Jim!

43
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,668
Just joking.

44
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,359
Hey, hey, hang on.

45
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,151
It could be a wrong number,
or a crank call or...

46
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,825
Gordon.

47
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,074
Uh-huh...

48
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:16,996
When?

49
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,571
All right. I'm on my way.

50
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,291
Your father's captain now.

51
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,669
The whole department's counting on him.

52
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,172
Well, I was counting on him, too.

53
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,849
I'll try and be quick.

54
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,163
Hello?

55
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,796
Gilda, there you are.

56
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,472
What?

57
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,224
Harvey.

58
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,887
- You're home.
- Better late than never.

59
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,719
Why are you hiding out here in the cold?

60
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,556
I know. I'm sorry, I just...

61
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,068
Mm, you started without me.

62
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,565
Did you have any kids?

63
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,661
What?

64
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,206
Trick-or-treaters.

65
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,576
Oh, no. I don't... no. I just...

66
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,413
I don't think I'm really up
for all that tonight.

67
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,373
Answering the door every five minutes...

68
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,302
Smiling.

69
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,885
Yeah, I saw the bowl on the porch.

70
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,133
It's okay. It's a ghost town out there.

71
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,590
So to speak.

72
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,444
We're gonna be eating
that candy for a month.

73
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,389
Or not.

74
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,226
You know I have a love-hate
relationship with candy.

75
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,357
You have a love-hate
relationship with everything.

76
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,116
Let's just crawl into bed

77
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,118
and watch an old
black and white movie on...

78
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,369
Baby, I'm so sorry.

79
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,297
You have to go.

80
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,625
Pick a movie. I'll be back soon.

81
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,012
I love you.

82
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,112
Does he always keep you
waiting like this?

83
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,746
He'll be here.

84
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,784
I thought you quit.

85
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,078
I have.

86
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,293
Hmm. Don't worry, I won't tell Barbara.

87
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,999
Gentlemen.

88
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:23,804
Ah. Good.

89
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,382
This is district attorney Harvey d...

90
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,761
Bats.

91
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,562
Dent.

92
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,475
Okay.

93
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,649
What's happened?

94
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,102
Johnny viti was murdered tonight.

95
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,448
Damn it!

96
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,111
The Roman's nephew.

97
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,274
He has a name.

98
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,241
It's carmine Falcone, not "the Roman."

99
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,159
Harvey, calm down.

100
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,238
Where were your men, Jim?
I've been working on viti for months!

101
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,449
Nobody on your team thought
he'd be vulnerable

102
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,000
the night before he's gonna
turn state's evidence?

103
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,589
22 caliber, taped handle,

104
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,667
serial number filed off.

105
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,095
Baby bottle nipple
for a silencer. Odd, but effective.

106
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,675
And untraceable.

107
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,661
Hard to tell if we're dealing
with a professional.

108
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,266
Of course it was a professional!

109
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,555
This was Falcone!

110
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,145
He found out viti
was gonna betray the family,

111
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,352
so he took him off the board!

112
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
Maybe.

113
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,020
We were so close.

114
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,524
We were so close, Jim.

115
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,405
He was ready to sing.

116
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,363
And not just about carmine,
the whole family was going away.

117
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,994
We had a real opportunity
to change things.

118
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,122
We still do. It's just a setback.

119
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,329
We'll find another way
to take down Falcone.

120
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,423
Together.

121
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,086
Where's the Jack-o'-lantern?

122
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,292
Excuse me?

123
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,760
You think it's important?

124
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,598
I don't know yet.

125
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,517
Look, Harvey's right.

126
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,641
This city's finally got a chance.

127
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,974
And it's the three men
standing here right now.

128
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,193
The Falcone crime family
has to be taken down.

129
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,488
So, I'm putting you two together.

130
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,407
District attorney dent
will work in the light, and you...

131
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,739
Will work the other side.

132
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,701
Bend the rules, but never break them.

133
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,249
And I'll do everything
I can to protect you both.

134
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,831
Understood.

135
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,300
He needs
to hear you say it, bats.

136
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,797
Two heads are better than one.

137
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,023
Leads come my way pretty fast.

138
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,355
Keep your ears open.

139
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,066
Then I guess we're up and...

140
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,574
Running.

141
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,866
He does that a lot. I just...

142
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,245
And I'm talking to myself.

143
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,245
Godfather.

144
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,489
I'm so sorry to hear about your nephew.

145
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,248
Grazie, amico.

146
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,503
Carmine,

147
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,952
no disrespect

148
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,504
but why are we sitting
on our hands here, huh?

149
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,415
He put two in Johnny's head!

150
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,010
Who did?

151
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,385
Salvatore maroni! Who else?

152
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,509
Ever since he took over that family,
he's been gunning for us,

153
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,716
and tonight he found the target.

154
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,847
It's a warning, for chrissakes!

155
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,106
Perhaps.

156
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,810
But let us be clear.

157
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,901
The man who pulled the trigger
did not load the gun.

158
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:10,483
Maroni's ambition was in check
until the law put a target on my back.

159
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,993
Now, it's open season.

160
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,162
If anyone is responsible
for my nephew's death,

161
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,579
it's that new son of a bitch
in the da's office.

162
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,379
Dent.

163
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,125
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Maybe he should sleep with the fishes.

164
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,796
Hell yes!

165
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,799
You just say the word, carmine,
and I'll do dent myself!

166
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,966
Settle, antoni.

167
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,385
At the right time, we'll hit back.
Until then...

168
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,562
The right time is now, carmine!

169
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,062
Now! Any delay is only gonna
make you look even weaker!

170
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,783
Thank you for your concern, antoni.

171
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,409
No disrespect, carmine.

172
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,037
It's "godfather."

173
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,247
Milos. Come on!

174
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,136
Please!

175
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,223
Milos! No!

176
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,558
Nol

177
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,071
We have other business to discuss?

178
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,664
Alberto?

179
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,375
Alberto!

180
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,331
Business time.

181
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,003
Take your crosswords for a walk.

182
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,208
They're... logic puzzles.

183
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,921
Thirty-two going on 13.

184
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,730
Wayne is not gonna support
any large-scale structuring effort.

185
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:10,651
So, for now, the assets will have to be
moved to a more secure facility.

186
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,987
Your equipment's weighing you down.

187
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,822
Why are you running?

188
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,622
Fun. You could use a little fun.

189
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,668
Give me your hand.

190
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,796
Nah.

191
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,669
Got you exactly where I want you.

192
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,098
Falcone.

193
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,554
Walt till you see what's inside.

194
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,946
Mm...

195
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,274
Have you ever seen this kind of money?

196
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,912
It's authentic.

197
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,624
So crisp and clean.

198
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,742
Actually, it's incredibly dirty.

199
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,545
Falcone's been having trouble
laundering his cash for some time.

200
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,381
We just didn't know
where he was stockpiling it.

201
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,965
Thank you.

202
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,008
I'm happy to help.

203
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,844
Why?

204
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,311
You could have kept it to yourself.

205
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,264
You could have lived
pretty well with all this.

206
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,776
Why hand it over?

207
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,653
To you?

208
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,787
Who knows?

209
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Get down!

210
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,091
Take it from me, pal,

211
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,050
around here,
curiosity can get you killed.

212
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,054
Let him go.

213
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,601
What? Why?

214
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,688
Because he's with me.

215
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,521
Also, because he's the da
who put all your friends into arkham.

216
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,361
We got room for one more.

217
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,028
Anyone follow us?

218
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,696
I could barely follow us.

219
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,832
Falcone imports has been doing
quite a business.

220
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,343
You know, if we were any other men...

221
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,437
We're not.

222
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,812
Yeah. No. Of course.

223
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,650
So, what now?

224
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,318
We should call Gordon.

225
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,067
Have his men pick this up as evidence.

226
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,825
Falcone owns the mayor
and the entire city assembly.

227
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,698
It'd be back in his coffers by tomorrow.

228
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,453
So, the only way to make
an impact is to make it disappear.

229
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,585
Yeah, but look at all this.
Moving it could take days.

230
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,253
Well, who said anything about moving it?

231
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,172
Why are you trying to hurt Falcone?

232
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,049
Why are you?

233
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,095
It's not personal, sweetheart.
It's justice.

234
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,773
Justice can be personal, sweetie.

235
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,193
Give me a head start.

236
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,191
I don't want to get caught
anywhere near here.

237
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,318
I don't know.

238
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,209
Gordon says
I'm supposed to work in the light.

239
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,859
Well, then, light it up.

240
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,580
I owe you one.

241
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,077
You owe me, like...

242
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,579
A billion-five.

243
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,342
I can't really be a lawyer
and a criminal, can I?

244
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,095
I want to win.

245
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,976
But do I want to win like this?

246
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,359
I'm of two minds here.

247
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,195
So, it's a coin flip.

248
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,401
Yeah, I guess it is.

249
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,152
Heads, we burn it down.

250
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,246
Okay.

251
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,851
Call chen.

252
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,543
Firefighters on the scene
here in the industrial district

253
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,932
working to contain the Blaze

254
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,689
before it can spread
to nearby homes and businesses.

255
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,437
Now, at this time, Jackie,

256
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,773
officials believe
the Falcone imports warehouse,

257
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,447
owned, of course,
by the notorious Falcone crime family,

258
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,537
to be vacant...

259
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,338
"Two heads are better than one."

260
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,653
Gilda?

261
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,276
Gilda?

262
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,503
Hey! You scared me.

263
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,339
I came home
and I didn't know where you were.

264
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,625
Did you hear me calling?

265
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,594
Please stay.

266
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,884
I'm not going anywhere.

267
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,633
I mean it. Don't leave me.

268
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,429
Baby, I know I haven't been around.
And I'm sorry.

269
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,638
But this job...

270
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,563
It isn't forever.

271
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,615
Hey, we caught a huge break tonight
on this Falcone thing.

272
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,411
Once I take him out,
and I will take him out,

273
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,947
things are gonna be different.

274
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,207
We can start a family.

275
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,502
You know I can't.

276
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,291
Of course you can. We can.

277
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,216
We'll talk about options
when you're ready,

278
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,761
but I need you to trust
that we're still on track.

279
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,385
And that I love you.

280
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,390
Now, are we still having
movie night, or not?

281
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,935
No, don't even answer that. Come on.

282
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,689
If we take 66th, we can cut them off
at the westward bridge.

283
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,365
No. Maintain a safe distance for now.

284
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,767
Good evening, sir.
The Turkey is roasting,

285
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,479
the pies are cooling,
and miss Kyle is en route.

286
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,695
Alfred, make a note
to order a new windshield.

287
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:39,949
Bulletproof.

288
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,073
Of course, sir, but if I may...

289
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,087
Aah!

290
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,302
I thought
you didn't hurt people!

291
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,474
You thought wrong.

292
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,854
You and your San ho hui buddies

293
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,527
were seen outside Harvey dent's house
on Halloween.

294
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,354
We were trick-or-treating.

295
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,869
Having fun?

296
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,153
Not yet.

297
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,159
But any second now.

298
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,532
Yeah!

299
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,487
Go. I'll keep an eye
on your little friends.

300
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,365
A "thank you" would be nice!

301
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,373
It is Thanksgiving.

302
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,594
We can make this easy, Mickey.

303
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,601
Just tell me who hired you to kill dent.

304
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,019
Go to hell, bat-freak!

305
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,437
Right now, the only difference
between you and me

306
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,519
is that I know what's down here.

307
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,904
Hmm.

308
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,091
Grundy.

309
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,962
He's mine.

310
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,637
Let him go.

311
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,515
This is your place.

312
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,686
Give him to me and I'll make sure
he never sets foot down here again.

313
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,354
You can be alone.

314
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:31,632
Born on a Monday.

315
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,807
One more for ya.

316
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,607
My goodness.

317
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,896
Oh, this one's not for your husband.
It's for you.

318
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,609
From a "Mr. Falcone."

319
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,873
I'm sorry, ma'am.

320
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,880
It's none of my business...

321
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,831
Isn't it time for his dinner?

322
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,796
I don't wanna be here, Mick.

323
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,634
My wife's cooking Turkey
with all the trimmings.

324
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,762
I love Turkey with all the trimmings.

325
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,223
So, just tell us what you know

326
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,229
about the bomb
in the district attorney's house,

327
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,810
then we can all go eat.

328
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,734
I don't even know carmine Falcone.

329
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,491
The Roman contracted your triad
to take out Harvey dent!

330
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,413
Your signature's all over it.

331
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,243
Mickey, you gotta help me
keep my friend here calm.

332
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,577
Just give us something...

333
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,256
Anything.

334
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,798
Someone's trying to frame me.

335
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,376
I told you. I'm innocent.

336
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,795
Chairs are for suspects.

337
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,255
This guy's innocent.

338
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,386
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

339
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,730
Hey. I thought we were
just doing a thing.

340
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,521
This little act doesn't get us anywhere
if the guy gets hurt.

341
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,399
Maybe you guys should admit
you have nothing on San ho hui.

342
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,485
If you had,
you would've booked me already.

343
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,617
All right. That's it. Montoya!

344
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,621
Please, show our friend out.

345
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,537
Maybe you should thank
whoever planted that bomb.

346
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,503
What did you say?

347
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,455
You still haven't figured out
who killed Johnny viti?

348
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,504
Get him outta my sight.

349
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,223
You may be aces in a fistfight,

350
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,926
but you've got a lot to learn
about detective work.

351
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,678
I found him, didn't I?

352
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,434
It's not just about finding them.

353
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,731
You gotta know how
they're gonna help your case.

354
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,981
Mickey chen is a small fish
protected by Falcone.

355
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,983
We were never going to get a confession.

356
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,321
We needed to make friends
and, in time, flip him.

357
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,278
Keep talking like that,
they'll make you da.

358
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,329
Harvey isn't dead yet.

359
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,873
And he isn't a killer, either.

360
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,791
No matter what that scumbag thinks.

361
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,704
He's never even owned a gun.

362
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,460
Falcone fits.

363
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,462
The Roman killed viti
and ordered the hit on dent.

364
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,553
Occam's razor.

365
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,635
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

366
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,808
All right. If I leave now,
I might just make dinner.

367
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,888
You should be with your people, too.

368
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,654
Fine.

369
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,739
Good night.

370
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,571
Happy Thanksgiving, Mrs. dent.

371
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,534
Now, I'm sure the missus is running out
to pick up some real food,

372
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,962
but I guarantee you, you have
never had pumpkin pie like...

373
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,633
Uh, Mr. dent?

374
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,053
I just, you know, wanna get out
of the city, I hate this place.

375
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,148
Nice.

376
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,779
The secret is the basil.

377
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,109
You want only the youngest leaves
from the youngest plant,

378
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,943
otherwise, it's like mint.

379
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,364
Overpowers everything.

380
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,579
We have a lot
to be thankful for, Alberto.

381
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,876
Such as?

382
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,670
Health. Family.

383
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,835
What's left of it.

384
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,048
If you are referring
to your cousin Johnny,

385
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,424
that is being handled.

386
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,468
By Mickey chen.

387
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,811
And who do you think hired him?

388
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,646
Of course.

389
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,477
Is there something you wish to say?

390
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,401
No, poppa.

391
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,610
Except to point out
that Harvey dent is still alive.

392
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,868
Because I allow it.

393
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,248
For now.

394
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,786
This...

395
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,167
This is what I keep talking about.

396
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,798
This is Oxford.

397
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,876
That place polluted your mind, Alberto.

398
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,628
You used to know your place. Now?

399
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,214
I should have never sent you there.

400
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,854
The dangers of independent thought.

401
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,937
When have you had
one independent thought

402
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,193
that actually benefited this family?

403
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,565
Maybe when I sent flowers
to dent's hospital room

404
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,820
in the Falcone name.

405
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,240
You did what?

406
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,039
I sent flowers.

407
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,117
I thought it would
take suspicion off of us

408
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,168
if we looked like we care
about his recovery.

409
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,164
Now, I suppose you'll say
it was a sloppy move.

410
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:13,173
I can forgive sloppy.

411
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,513
What I will not tolerate,

412
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,892
is you presuming to speak
on behalf of this family.

413
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,021
Let me be perfectly clear.

414
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:29,867
Again.

415
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,621
Any notion you may hold
about being next in line

416
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,370
to take over our business interests

417
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,542
is a pathetic delusion.

418
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,881
You are weak.

419
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,014
Your weakness is my liability.

420
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,804
You are to have zero contact
with Mr. or Mrs. Harvey dent.

421
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,355
End of discussion.

422
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,702
Harvey!

423
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,710
Hello.

424
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,495
I got a call that you went
missing from the hospital.

425
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,583
How did I know I'd find you here?

426
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,092
Couldn't stand being cooped up anymore.

427
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,677
Thought I'd stretch my legs.

428
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:19,768
Yeah.

429
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,851
Listen, why don't you hop in?
I'll take you back.

430
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,555
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
I like it out here.

431
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,518
I'm on my way home
for Thanksgiving dinner.

432
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,647
You should come along.
Barbara always makes a ton.

433
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,776
I'm not hungry.

434
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,908
Harvey, what are we doing here?

435
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,501
I don't know.
Maybe I wasn't ready for this yet.

436
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,455
I think I'm gonna go back now.

437
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,541
Don't you worry about Harvey.

438
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,883
All right, counselor.

439
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:06,225
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't have this.

440
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:13,312
The falcones are dangerous people
and, to them, you're the bad guy.

441
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:14,983
Protect your family.

442
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,337
So, I made him an offer, you know.

443
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,262
To the family.

444
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,260
Those dearly departed...

445
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,896
And those whom we are fortunate
to have beside us here today.

446
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,349
Let us be thankful for the time
we still have together

447
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,277
and for the many blessings
bestowed upon us.

448
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,444
- Alla salute!
- Salute!

449
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,751
Ah, yes.

450
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,818
- Oh, look.
- Oh, come here!

451
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,298
- Oh-ho!
- Yeah!

452
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,544
- I told you I'd walk.
- Very good. Very good.

453
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,550
Yeah!

454
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,266
\wwhoo-hoo!

455
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,803
Welcome back.

456
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,074
Barbara?

457
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,135
Ooh!

458
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,994
Solomon grundy...

459
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,786
Born on a Monday...

460
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,964
Believe me, I told him
where he could stick the cape.

461
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,638
Even Gordon laughed.

462
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,724
That's when they let me go.

463
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,553
You don't need me for this.
I should be out hunting.

464
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,346
We've got it covered.

465
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,012
All of Gotham pd will be deployed
throughout town by midnight.

466
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,770
One way or another, when holiday
comes calling, we'll be ready.

467
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,727
You know, this was all you.

468
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,697
I wanted them
in Gotham penitentiary.

469
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:49,198
This was Harvey. And he was right.

470
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,910
Calendar man.

471
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,131
So...

472
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,879
A killer who only works on holidays.

473
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,461
And it's December 24th.

474
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,849
I was wondering when you'd get to me.

475
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,722
We don't have much time, day.

476
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,561
Who killed Johnny viti on Halloween?

477
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:21,147
The same person who killed Mickey chen
and his crew on Thanksgiving.

478
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,274
We need a better answer than that.

479
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,564
Viti was the Roman's nephew.

480
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,487
The Roman was chen's employer.

481
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,449
First suspect is, therefore,

482
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,124
the Roman.

483
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,705
But since sneaking around
isn't really Falcone's style,

484
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,836
we move on to the second suspect.

485
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,546
Someone hoping for the fall
of the Roman empire.

486
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,556
Like sal maroni.

487
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,350
He's as good a guess
as any of the others.

488
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,977
What "others"?

489
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,349
You're down a man.

490
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,519
This is a waste of time.

491
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,854
I told you to bring Mr. dent.

492
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,193
He isn't safe out there.

493
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,785
The da who put you all in arkham?

494
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,866
Half the patients here
would kill him on sight,

495
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,870
so, I'd say out there
is the only place he is safe.

496
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,005
Perhaps.

497
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,796
Or perhaps he doesn't know you're here.

498
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,504
Perhaps...

499
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,921
The district attorney...

500
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,174
Is a suspect.

501
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,265
Ah.

502
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:48,696
Well, of course.
Intelligent, calculating,

503
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,866
with a mission
to take down carmine Falcone.

504
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:53,825
It all fits.

505
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,782
Harvey dent is not a killer.

506
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,783
Unless he's leading a double life.

507
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,879
Like your caped crusader, here.

508
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,456
Why did you ask for me?

509
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,466
So you could see for yourself.

510
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,383
I don't have time for your crazy.

511
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,306
You really don't.

512
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,432
There's lots of crazy
out there these days.

513
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,021
And just when you thought
you'd cleaned it all up.

514
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,020
What a...

515
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,699
Joke.

516
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,658
Happy holiday.

517
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,122
Open it!

518
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,686
He had somebody get to my kid!

519
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,689
If... if I didn't help him.

520
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,605
I'm sorry.

521
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,905
Harvey isn't safe.

522
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,198
Go!

523
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,838
"Tis the season to be jolly

524
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,380
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

525
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,463
Outside it's an awful chiller

526
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,425
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

527
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,603
Boy, this holiday's a killer

528
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,932
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

529
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,059
Gilda? Is that you?

530
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,354
"Gilda"!

531
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,825
She looked like a gilda.

532
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,915
Relax, lollipop!

533
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,714
Police issue.

534
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,092
Where's my wife?

535
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:17,720
She's just where I left her,
last-minute shopping.

536
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,551
Spoiler alert. It's socks.

537
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,972
What do you want?

538
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,433
Aww, I thought
I was playing santi claus!

539
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,393
Oh, all right.

540
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,980
I want a fire engine
and a football and...

541
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,612
To deliver a message.

542
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,988
Put the gun down and we'll talk.

543
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:47,794
Sure!

544
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,787
Your suspicions were correct.

545
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,309
A Santa clown has reportedly terrorized
three families today.

546
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,396
Sir, they were all named "dent."

547
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,031
Whoo!

548
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,923
Where did you get that?

549
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,547
Why?

550
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,216
Ya missin' one?

551
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,477
You could use some cheering up!

552
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,431
Have ya heard the one
about the murderous clown

553
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,186
that escaped the asylum

554
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:56,769
and showed up at the home of the da
who put him there?

555
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,403
See, there's a persistent rumor
round these parts

556
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,824
that da dent
is more than he appears to be.

557
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:11,037
But there's only room for one
homicidal maniac in this town.

558
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:15,963
And if I hear that happy Harvey dent
is steppin' out,

559
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:20,009
I'll make sure little gilda
doesn't have to clothes-shop

560
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,461
for hubby-wubby ever again.

561
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,214
You call that a joke?

562
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,142
But you haven't even
heard the punchline!

563
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,594
It goes like this!

564
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,156
Harvey.

565
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,069
Harvey, can you hear me?

566
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,781
Any idea where he was heading?

567
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,041
Maroni...

568
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,166
Mangia.

569
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,566
What happened to your
friend's face, maroni?

570
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:19,393
Nothin'. What happened to yours?

571
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,528
Oh, you mother...

572
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,813
Tell me everything he said.

573
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,448
If you get off of my neck.

574
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,117
He was inside before we got there.

575
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,744
Took out the whole staff,
poisoned the fagioli.

576
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,247
I wasn't hungry,
but, uh, Freddy, here...

577
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,670
I don't know. Guess I'm lucky.

578
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,548
No. He let you live. Why?

579
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,262
Do I look like I know?

580
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,261
He put a gun in my face
and told me that this is his turf

581
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,510
and that he's cracking down
on interlopers.

582
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,136
Maybe I should thank him.

583
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,520
I don't know where you get off.

584
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:02,315
Freaks like this clown used to play
way out on the fringe,

585
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:03,733
but once you showed up...

586
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,076
Relax, pal.

587
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,576
Ya know, things used to
run smooth in this town.

588
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:18,418
Now, we got killer crocs
and moths and sewer zombies,

589
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,871
not to mention a homicidal maniac

590
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,833
skulking around the holidays
hittin' made men.

591
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,014
What's the common thread? Huh.

592
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,132
Where is he?

593
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,180
Who knows? He's a nutjob.

594
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,432
But if he's the guy
killin' Falcone's men,

595
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,435
it's only a matter of time
till he gets to old carmine himself.

596
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:40,898
Maybe start there.

597
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,563
Not really much of a detective, are ya?

598
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,141
Hello.

599
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:33,069
Navy, Navy, charcoal, black.

600
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,247
Ugh!

601
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:38,332
Really, carm, is a splash
of color too much to ask?

602
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,244
Stop clowning around.
If you're gonna kill me, just do it.

603
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,624
Is this the face of a killer?

604
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,592
Ugh!

605
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,051
I guess it is!

606
00:55:56,436 --> 00:56:00,020
Oh, relax, polpetto,
I'm not going to kill you.

607
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,014
Not tonight, anyway.

608
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,146
It's Christmas!

609
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:06,821
But...

610
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,856
Someone will die tonight.

611
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,450
Probably someone close to you.

612
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,696
Don't you want to know
who's pulling the trigger?

613
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,913
Anyhoo, I just popped in to say,

614
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:25,246
if you hear any news about
the holiday investigation,

615
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,706
I'd like you to pass it my way.

616
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,505
As a professional courtesy.

617
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,676
Here's my card!

618
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:38,926
Buon natale!

619
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,856
Buon natale.

620
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,524
Hoo!

621
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,810
I kill me.

622
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,412
What the hell?

623
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:08,716
Missed me!

624
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,419
Whoo!

625
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,638
You know what I forgot?

626
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,368
Whoa! That was close.

627
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,248
Wheel

628
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,437
I would remind you, sir,

629
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,066
of Mr. Falcone's annual benefit
for the Gotham children's clinic.

630
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:59,032
It would be advisable to show your face
at least one year.

631
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,861
Your father built that hospital.

632
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,695
He helped the Roman build it.

633
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,619
Still, a good cause.

634
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,543
And, frankly, a night on a yacht
could do you some good.

635
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,669
Miss Kyle will be there.

636
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,051
Three murders on three holidays.

637
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,929
Each of the victims
a Falcone associate.

638
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:23,382
All shot with the same type
of untraceable gun.

639
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
No withesses.

640
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,395
Suspects?

641
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,889
Salvatore maroni.

642
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,558
His family's always been
second to the Roman.

643
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,980
He's notoriously ambitious.

644
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,859
But he's killed Falcone's men
in broad daylight.

645
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,235
Why the cloak-and-dagger
holiday business?

646
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,402
Carla viti, Falcone's sister.

647
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,745
Runs their Chicago operation.

648
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,164
She could be making a play
for control of the family.

649
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,084
By killing
her only son on Halloween?

650
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,411
She is a criminal.

651
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,207
And he is a homicidal maniac.

652
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,259
The guard testified that
he escaped before the first murder.

653
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,844
The Roman himself.

654
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,090
Johnny viti was about to flip

655
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:07,301
and Mickey chen could testify
that Falcone ordered dent's murder.

656
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,179
He had motive to silence them both.

657
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,348
But why kill his own bodyguard?

658
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,934
May I ask why you're keeping
the fifth suspect off the board?

659
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,394
Because I don't like it.

660
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,440
But it fits. Doesn't it?

661
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,034
Obsessed with taking down Falcone.

662
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,872
More than boss maroni
and every ambitious made man in town.

663
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,701
He was turned down
for a gun license last year,

664
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,958
when the psych eval showed some
wild aberrations.

665
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,673
Or is it someone else entirely?

666
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,592
Someone we haven't even considered.

667
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,052
I thought this would be about sweeping
criminals off the street,

668
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,137
maybe scaring them straight.

669
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:52,312
I never thought that Batman
was going to have to be a detective.

670
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,399
A good one.

671
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,939
What if I can't save them, Alfred?

672
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:02,072
I've seen these growing pains
before, sir,

673
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,491
and I am confident that, in the end,

674
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,661
the Batman will be
what the world needs him to be.

675
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,662
The same, I believe,
should be said of Bruce Wayne.

676
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,314
My distinguished guests,

677
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,488
it is my honor to welcome
you here tonight.

678
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,492
I see a lot of familiar faces. Mayor.

679
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,370
Your eminence.

680
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,417
No, I was talking to sal maroni.

681
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,716
Sal maroni. On my yacht.

682
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:08,130
It's like my father always said,
"keep your enemies close...

683
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,428
And a loaded gun closer."

684
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:16,809
Yeanh.

685
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,063
Thirty years ago,
a small group of concerned gothamites

686
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,734
joined together to build something

687
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:25,279
the politicians squabbling
in the halls of government could not.

688
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:27,733
Dr. Thomas Wayne and I

689
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,694
built the children's clinic
to protect families.

690
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:32,574
And if you know me,

691
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:37,580
you know there is nothing
more important to me than family.

692
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,166
So, buon anno!

693
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,381
Thank you all for being here
and for your generosity.

694
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,459
Let's beat last year's total.

695
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,966
Remember, cash only, please.

696
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,685
Also, I would like to thank
our corporate sponsors,

697
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,145
kord omniversal,

698
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,567
soder cola,

699
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:10,693
and, for the 10th year running,
Gotham broadcasting company.

700
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,236
Oh! On.

701
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,287
I'm so sorry!

702
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,375
Here, let me.

703
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:22,003
No, thank you.

704
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,548
One more thing, and then
I promise I'll let you enjoy the party.

705
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,334
I would like to acknowledge someone.

706
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,922
As I said, nothing is more
important to me than family.

707
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,515
And, perhaps, my one regret

708
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:39,642
is making this man feel like
he is not a part of this family.

709
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,524
We have not always agreed on details.

710
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,900
But we agree
on the most important things.

711
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,447
We believe in family.

712
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:56,037
We believe in business.

713
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,952
And, like all of you here tonight,

714
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,123
we believe in Gotham city.

715
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,923
Ladies and gentlemen,
the son I never had...

716
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,046
Mr. Bruce Wayne.

717
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,132
- I think I see them!
- Wh-what?

718
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,588
As if it matters.
I hardly ever see you, anyway.

719
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,507
I'm just saying, there's no need to...

720
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,883
Hey, Harvey!

721
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:03,221
Shouldn't you be working, captain?

722
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,400
I am.

723
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,896
This is the largest police presence
this city's ever seen.

724
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,898
We got caught with our
pants down on Christmas,

725
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,401
but heaven help holiday
if he tries anything here tonight.

726
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,906
Always on duty.

727
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:18,997
Always.

728
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,117
You didn't bring the kids?

729
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,537
They're sleeping over
at my mother's tonight.

730
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,461
We should try and hire you
to sit next time, gilda.

731
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,504
I bet you're great with kids.

732
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,752
I haven't worked as a sitter in years.

733
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,467
It paid her way
through law school.

734
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:35,212
I didn't know you're a lawyer.

735
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:36,515
I was.

736
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,677
Now, I'm not anything.

737
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,268
Dead pilot? Check.

738
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,980
Ground crew? Check.

739
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,773
Poison gas? Check.

740
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:59,152
Time to ring in the new year.

741
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:10,497
Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seatbelts,

742
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:14,801
as I have no idea how to fly this thing!

743
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,731
Looks like a real party.

744
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,938
So, what the hell are we doing here?

745
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,575
I don't know.

746
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,410
Something tells me
this is where I need to be tonight.

747
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,659
We...

748
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,416
Look, we haven't talked,
and I think we should.

749
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,797
I feel like whatever this is...

750
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:58,804
Whatever we've tried to be to
one another is... unraveling.

751
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,965
And we both know why.

752
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,518
We've never spoken of it,

753
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:09,348
but the truth is that
you and I are two different people.

754
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,438
It was fun to try...

755
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:16,529
But I don't think we're ever
gonna be able to put it all together.

756
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,654
I guess we're just not cut out for...

757
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:22,781
Whatever this is.

758
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:24,992
Was.

759
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,797
Don't worry, though.
I'll see you on the other side.

760
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:51,893
When did you do it?

761
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,062
Do what?

762
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:57,566
You took my watch without me noticing.

763
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,773
So, when did you do it? I'm curious.

764
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:02,692
Take it from me, Bruce,

765
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:06,738
around here,
curiosity can get you killed.

766
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:16,675
Not now.

767
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,137
What?

768
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,180
Where?

769
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,683
I just want to have a normal night.
Can we just have a normal night?

770
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,223
I don't even know what that is anymore.

771
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,058
I am alone here.

772
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,654
I told myself it was okay
because it would get better,

773
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,448
but it hasn't.

774
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,908
You don't have to be alone.

775
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:47,282
We've talked about having a baby.

776
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,532
I can't! You know that I can't!

777
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,333
Maybe not the old-fashioned way,

778
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,023
but that doesn't mean
that we can't try something...

779
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,787
I don't want it.

780
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:59,670
I don't want it because I can't
and I can't because I don't want it.

781
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,170
Can we please
talk about this in private?

782
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,765
Jesus, why can't you be more like...

783
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,518
More like who?

784
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,813
I'm only one man.

785
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:18,984
I can't do this.

786
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,236
Not now.

787
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,366
Excuse us.

788
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:32,491
Jim, did you know they're
having these kinds of problems?

789
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,121
Jim?

790
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,702
Yeah. I see it now.

791
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:36,797
Huh?

792
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,922
What's going on?

793
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,172
Crappy new year!

794
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,442
Hey.

795
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:16,577
Should all offenses be forgot
and never brought to trial...

796
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,999
Oh, silly me. The safety. Ha!

797
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:30,306
Ooh, pretty.

798
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:40,900
Huh?

799
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,690
Well, shit.

800
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:57,784
Economy class
ain't what she used to be. Ha!

801
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,946
This area needs to be clear!

802
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,551
Everyone remain calm.

803
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:08,638
This way!

804
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,466
- Pearce!
- Captain, sir!

805
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,263
I need to get my wife out of here.

806
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,015
Yes, sir! Follow me, ma'am.

807
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,287
What are you trying to prove
with this stunt, joker?

808
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,290
Prove? Stunt? Joker?

809
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,508
No, wait, that one's right.

810
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,426
Why did you kill Johnny viti?
“What?

811
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,755
And Mickey chen and milos grappa?

812
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,886
You think I'm holiday?

813
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:59,437
Oh, poppet, I didn't know you cared.

814
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,143
Of course I'm not holiday!

815
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,980
If I were him,
why would I be trying to kill him?

816
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,533
Kill him?

817
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,653
He's the competition!

818
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,360
And, like the corn kernel always says,

819
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,912
"I won't be number two."

820
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,248
If it's holiday you want dead...

821
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,421
Then why gas everyone in Gotham square?

822
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:32,674
Half the city's down there,

823
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,508
which means holiday either is, or isn't!

824
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,968
I have a 50-50 chance.

825
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:43,181
And if I fail, well, at least
I've killed a lot of innocent people.

826
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,613
No, don't kill me!
Not before I find out who holiday is!

827
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:57,702
Why do you care?

828
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,406
Oh, you adorable fool!

829
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:04,752
Don't you know by now?
I'm just like youl!

830
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,793
We both love a good puzzle.

831
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,262
So, when the clock strikes 12:00,

832
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,559
do I get a little kiss?

833
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,619
Whoop! Taking that as a "no."

834
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,564
There goes my resolution.

835
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:11,986
Hal

836
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,487
out of the way. Now! Move!

837
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,592
Alberto, right?

838
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:43,269
Selina.

839
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,398
Can I ask you a question?

840
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:53,273
I'm trying to imagine what it's like
to grow up around all this.

841
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:54,906
I wouldn't know.

842
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:59,825
"Mr. family" had me in boarding schools
overseas before I could walk.

843
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,867
Which is fine.
I would have never fit in here, anyway.

844
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,330
I'm an Oxford graduate
who's learned more about business

845
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,754
than my father could ever
hope to understand, yet...

846
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,706
You don't get a seat at the table.

847
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,377
Because I'm "weak." I fell in love.

848
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,716
How is that weak?

849
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:24,133
She was the wrong woman.
Wrong for the family.

850
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,558
Wrong for him.

851
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,685
And, back then,
I was so desperate for his approval.

852
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:33,984
What happened to her?

853
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,064
Terrible things.

854
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,901
I let him scare her away from me.

855
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:44,829
Which, ironically, only proved that he
was right about me in the first place.

856
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,494
Weak. An embarrassment.

857
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:51,752
I'm sorry, I don't mean to...

858
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,296
Why do I feel like I can talk to you?

859
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,591
Uh, I, um...

860
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,093
I just...

861
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,936
Oh, no. No, I'm sorry, I...

862
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,521
I can't... we can't.

863
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:12,769
Get away from her.

864
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,990
Bruce!

865
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,491
Wait. Bruce? Wayne?

866
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,236
Bruce Wayne is the Batman?

867
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,288
And Alberto Falcone is holiday.

868
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,036
Surprises all around.

869
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,081
Me? You've been fed
some bad clues, Bruce.

870
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,963
But I still solved the puzzle.

871
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,548
The rejected son,

872
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:41,799
born to inherit an empire,
but cast aside.

873
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:43,967
You're wrong.

874
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,391
You knew you'd never be
handed the keys to the kingdom,

875
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:51,141
so you manufactured a crisis
that targets the family business.

876
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:52,438
What?

877
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,312
With potential successors
dropping like flies,

878
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,734
poppa tightened the circle
to family only,

879
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:00,905
and, for the first time,
you were on the inside.

880
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,450
I don't want control of the family!

881
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:06,614
I never did!

882
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:11,369
Ten! Nine! Eight!
Seven! Six! Five!

883
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,575
Four! Three!

884
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,501
I would happily trade
that for a normal life!

885
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:16,704
To spend my days as far away
from Gotham as possible.

886
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:17,901
Two! One! Happy new year!

887
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,790
To get married, and have a child with...

888
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:29,676
Oh, my god!

889
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,948
You couldn't know.

890
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,997
You're missing so many pieces.

891
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:50,743
Come on.

892
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,656
Jim, what the hell are we doing?

893
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,627
Oh.

894
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:07,795
The divers will be fishing out
parts of Alberto Falcone for days.

895
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,047
Five-bladed prop
on its slowest speed.

896
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:11,963
Hell of a way to go.

897
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,547
That isn't how he went.

898
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,809
He was shot by holiday
before going overboard.

899
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:21,014
Hang on. Alberto wasn't holiday?

900
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:22,648
I thought he was.

901
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,522
It was occam's razor, Jim,
the simplest solution.

902
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:27,739
But it was wrong.

903
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,781
I went there for Alberto Falcone.

904
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,486
I thought I was supposed to stop him,

905
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,496
but I was supposed to save him.

906
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:43,293
He was innocent. And now he's dead.

907
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,380
I needed to be better.

908
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,592
We all did.

909
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:52,764
All of us.

910
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:57,265
You have to put a protective detail
on carmine Falcone.

911
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:58,884
If he'll even let you.

912
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,646
Do you realize we started out
trying to take down the Roman,

913
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,644
and, now, we're trying to save him?

914
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,475
When did that happen?

915
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:07,810
I have a better question.

916
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:11,944
If Alberto Falcone wasn't holiday...
Then who is?

917
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,116
And who's next?

918
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:04,073
Grant that our brother
may sleep here

919
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,701
in peace until you awaken him to glory,

920
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:10,034
for you are the resurrection
and the life.

921
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,289
Then he will see you face to face

922
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:15,247
and in your light will see light

923
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:17,503
and know the splendor of god.

924
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:18,803
Amen.

925
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,339
Amen.

926
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:38,364
Bruce.

927
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,317
A word.

928
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,817
Carmine. If there's anything I can do.

929
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:48,156
You know what I want you to do
but, time and time again, you refuse me.

930
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:53,752
The Wayne foundation isn't a
money-laundering outfit for the mob.

931
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,581
And it won't be,
so long as I'm in control.

932
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:00,928
Of course.

933
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,009
Oh, how rude of me.

934
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,965
I don't believe you've met my associate.

935
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:10,187
Charmed.
