2
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:55,546
I only came here
out of respect

3
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,114
for my parents who...

4
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:00,117
knew your family.

5
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,519
Your father...

6
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:04,087
was more than just a friend
to my family.

7
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:08,992
That was
a long time ago.

8
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:11,962
Yes.

9
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:15,566
A long time.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,301
Thomas Wayne believed
in my father.

11
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,372
He believed a man could bring
order to a world of chaos.

12
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:24,609
And you, Bruce?

13
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:33,584
I believe in Gotham City.

14
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:45,696
- You try the vongole?
- Mm. Delicious.

15
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,453
Oh. Hmm.

16
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,745
Master Bruce. Happy Halloween.

17
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:56,881
Is there coffee?

18
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:58,516
In the study, sir.

19
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:04,522
A Miss Kyle telephoned.

20
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:07,792
She said she was checking the number
you gave her to make sure it's real.

21
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,462
The gates are open.

22
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:12,430
We haven't seen
a trick-or-treater in years.

23
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,765
We won't see one tonight.

24
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,299
Hardly worth the security risk,
wouldn't you say?

25
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,769
Respectfully, sir,

26
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:21,839
if our security is dependent
on $600 worth of iron alloy...

27
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,911
This city is fallen, Alfred.

28
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,884
Then we must endeavor
to lift it up again, Bruce.

29
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:41,425
In the meantime,
we live in obstinate hope.

30
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,893
And an unlocked mansion.

31
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:45,663
Anyway...

32
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:47,732
it's an absurd holiday.

33
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:49,834
Oh, yes.

34
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,569
Putting on costumes
and striking fear.

35
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,471
Quite absurd.

36
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,307
Do you really think...

37
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:01,712
I hate when he does that.

38
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:12,490
Whoa, whoa, whoa. James.

39
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:14,257
Babs! No running!

40
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:20,296
Come on guys, slow down!
You're gonna hurt yourselves.

41
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,298
They're excited, Jim.

42
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,901
Big night.

43
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,770
Yeah. All right.

44
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,738
But we're taking the squad car.

45
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:28,839
Too many crazies out.

46
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:31,375
Sir!

47
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:37,280
Hang on.

48
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,390
Now you're ready.

49
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:48,926
All right, who wants to drive?

50
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,863
Jim!

51
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,835
Just joking.

52
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,577
Hey, hey, hang on.

53
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,013
It could be a wrong number,
or a crank call or...

54
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,550
Gordon.

55
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:14,552
Uh-huh.

56
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,354
When?

57
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:18,622
All right.

58
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:19,824
I'm on my way.

59
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:24,495
Your father's Captain now.

60
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,996
The whole department's
counting on him.

61
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:29,900
Well, I was
counting on him, too.

62
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,044
I'll try and be quick.

63
00:08:58,128 --> 00:08:58,996
Hello?

64
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,744
Gilda. There you are.

65
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:16,447
What?

66
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:18,949
Harvey.

67
00:09:19,783 --> 00:09:20,784
You're home.

68
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:23,053
Better late than never.

69
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:24,755
Why are you hiding
out here in the cold?

70
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:25,789
I know.

71
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,558
I'm sorry, I-I just...

72
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:32,730
Mm, you started without me.

73
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:36,667
Did you have any kids?

74
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:39,603
What?

75
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:42,473
Trick-or-treaters.

76
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,709
Oh, no. I...

77
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:48,212
No. I just...

78
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:51,582
I don't think I'm really up
for all that tonight.

79
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,517
Answering the door
every five minutes...

80
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:55,686
smiling.

81
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,955
Yeah, I saw the bowl
on the porch.

82
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,857
It's okay.
It's a ghost town out there.

83
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,725
So to speak.

84
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,427
We're gonna be eating
that candy for a month.

85
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:10,100
Or not.

86
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,236
You know I have a love-hate
relationship with candy.

87
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:14,905
You have a love-hate
relationship with everything.

88
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:24,148
Let's just crawl into bed

89
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:25,149
and watch an old

90
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,183
black and white movie on...

91
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,518
Baby, I'm so sorry.

92
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,191
You have to go.

93
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:36,527
Pick a movie.
I'll be back soon.

94
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:38,896
I love you.

95
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,689
Does he always keep you
waiting like this?

96
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:07,825
He'll be here.

97
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,694
I thought you quit.

98
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:13,764
I have.

99
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:16,166
Hmm. Don't worry,
I won't tell Barbara.

100
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,234
Gentlemen.

101
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:23,807
Ah. Good.

102
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,542
This is District Attorney
Harvey D...

103
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:26,243
Bats.

104
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:28,545
Dent.

105
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:31,615
Okay.

106
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:34,985
What's happened?

107
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,720
Johnny Viti was
murdered tonight.

108
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:39,790
Damn it!

109
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:40,958
The Roman's nephew.

110
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,292
He has a name.

111
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,261
It's Carmine Falcone,
not "The Roman."

112
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:45,195
Harvey, calm down.

113
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:46,663
Where were your men, Jim?

114
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:48,565
I've been working on Viti
for months!

115
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,601
Nobody on your team
thought he'd be vulnerable

116
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:52,836
the night before he's gonna
turn state's evidence?

117
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:58,742
.22 caliber, taped handle,

118
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:00,811
serial number filed off.

119
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,846
Baby bottle nipple
for a silencer.

120
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,615
Odd, but effective.

121
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,150
And untraceable.

122
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,885
Hard to tell if we're dealing
with a professional.

123
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:10,854
Of course it was a professional!
This was Falcone!

124
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:14,925
He found out Viti was gonna betray the
family so he took him off the board!

125
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:16,960
Maybe.

126
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,131
We were so close.

127
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,701
We were so close, Jim.

128
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,670
He was ready to sing.

129
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,374
And not just about Carmine,
the whole family was going away.

130
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:32,176
We had a real opportunity
to change things.

131
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,243
We still do.

132
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:35,179
It's just a setback.

133
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,348
We'll find another way
to take down Falcone.

134
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,049
Together.

135
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,651
Where's
the jack-o'-lantern?

136
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:42,219
Excuse me?

137
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,858
You think it's important?

138
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,726
I don't know yet.

139
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,161
Look, Harvey's right.

140
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,798
This city's finally
got a chance.

141
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:58,403
And it's the three men
standing here right now.

142
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:01,171
The Falcone crime family
has to be taken down.

143
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:03,674
So I'm putting
you two together.

144
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:06,076
District Attorney Dent will
work in the light, and you...

145
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:10,047
will work the other side.

146
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,850
Bend the rules,
but never break them.

147
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:14,952
And I'll do everything I can
to protect you both.

148
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,221
Understood.

149
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,263
He needs
to hear you say it, Bats.

150
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:27,898
Two heads are better than one.

151
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,676
Leads come my way
pretty fast.

152
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,811
Keep your ears open.

153
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:43,113
Then I guess we're up and...

154
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:45,383
running.

155
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:47,951
He does that a lot.

156
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:48,952
I just...

157
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,157
And I'm talking to myself.

158
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,763
Godfather.

159
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,965
I'm so sorry
to hear about your nephew.

160
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,267
<i>Grazie, amico.</i>

161
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:39,370
Carmine.

162
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:41,038
No disrespect,

163
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:43,874
but why are we sitting
on our hands here, huh?

164
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:45,376
He put two in Johnny's head!

165
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:47,077
Who did?

166
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,414
Salvatore Maroni! Who else?

167
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,181
Ever since
he took over that family,

168
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:52,517
he's been gunning for us,

169
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,851
and tonight,
he found the target.

170
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:56,853
It's a warning, for Chrissakes.

171
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,122
Perhaps.

172
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,793
But let us be clear.

173
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:06,129
The man who pulled the trigger
did not load the gun.

174
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:10,468
Maroni's ambition was in check until
the law put a target on my back.

175
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:14,405
Now it's open season.

176
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:17,874
If anyone is responsible
for my nephew's death,

177
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:20,712
it's that new son of a bitch
in the DA's office.

178
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,246
Dent.

179
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,184
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Maybe he should sleep with the fishes.

180
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:30,521
Hell yes!

181
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,523
You just say the word, Carmine,
and I'll do Dent myself!

182
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,860
Settle, Antoni.

183
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,296
At the right time,
we'll hit back. Until then...

184
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,532
The right time is now, Carmine!

185
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,835
Now! Any delay is only gonna
make you look even weaker!

186
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:53,910
Thank you
for your concern, Antoni.

187
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,082
No... no disrespect, Carmine.

188
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,256
It's "Godfather."

189
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,459
Milos. Come on!

190
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:11,529
Please!

191
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,265
Milos! No!

192
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:17,901
No!

193
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:36,019
We have other business
to discuss?

194
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,590
Alberto?

195
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:42,360
Alberto!

196
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,296
Business time.

197
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:48,198
Take your crosswords
for a walk.

198
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,201
They're...

199
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,437
logic puzzles.

200
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,074
Thirty-two going on thirteen.

201
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:03,348
Wayne is
not gonna support

202
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:05,616
any large-scale
structuring effort.

203
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,455
So, for now, the assets will have to
be moved to a more secure facility...

204
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:03,441
Your equipment's
weighing you down.

205
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:04,975
Why are you running?

206
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,110
Fun.

207
00:18:07,144 --> 00:18:08,546
You could use a little fun.

208
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:48,586
Give me your hand.

209
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,622
Nah.

210
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:40,471
Got you exactly
where I want you.

211
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:45,576
Falcone.

212
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:48,579
Wait till you see
what's inside.

213
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:01,091
Mm...

214
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,361
Have you ever seen
this kind of money?

215
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,196
It's authentic.

216
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:11,769
So crisp and clean.

217
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:14,070
Actually,
it's incredibly dirty.

218
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:16,807
Falcone's been having trouble
laundering his cash for some time.

219
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,776
We just didn't know
where he was stockpiling it.

220
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,549
Thank you.

221
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:25,583
I'm happy to help.

222
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,685
Why?

223
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:33,424
You could have kept it
to yourself.

224
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:35,393
You could have lived
pretty well with all this.

225
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:36,661
Why hand it over?

226
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:38,563
To you?

227
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,672
Who knows.

228
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:02,252
Get down!

229
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:07,391
Take it from me, pal,

230
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:10,160
around here,
curiosity can get you killed.

231
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:11,227
Let him go.

232
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:12,663
What? Why?

233
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:13,698
Because he's with me.

234
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,803
Also because he's the DA who put
all your friends into Arkham.

235
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:21,806
We got room for one more.

236
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:30,481
Anyone follow us?

237
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:31,682
I could barely follow us.

238
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:42,660
Falcone Imports has been doing
quite a business.

239
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:53,371
You know,
if we were any other men...

240
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:54,372
We're not.

241
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:57,742
Yeah. No. Of course.

242
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:01,712
So, what now?

243
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:03,313
We should call Gordon.

244
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:06,817
Have his men
pick this up as evidence.

245
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:09,854
Falcone owns the mayor
and the entire city assembly.

246
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:12,790
It'd be back in his coffers
by tomorrow.

247
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:16,560
So the only way to make
an impact is to make it disappear.

248
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:18,261
Yeah, but look at all this.

249
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:19,597
Moving it could take days.

250
00:22:23,334 --> 00:22:25,301
Well, who said anything
about moving it?

251
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:31,307
Why are you trying
to hurt Falcone?

252
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,378
Why are you?

253
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:36,681
It's not personal, sweetheart.
It's justice.

254
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:39,850
Justice can be personal,

255
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:40,785
sweetie.

256
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:44,422
Give me a head start.

257
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:46,657
I don't want to get caught
anywhere near here.

258
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:48,459
I don't know.

259
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,260
Gordon says I'm supposed
to work in the light.

260
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:51,862
Well, then, light it up.

261
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:57,635
I owe you one.

262
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,906
You owe me like...

263
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:03,641
a billion-five.

264
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:16,420
I can't really be a lawyer
and a criminal, can I?

265
00:23:17,588 --> 00:23:18,556
I want to win.

266
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:21,959
But do I want to win like this?

267
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:24,962
I'm of two minds here.

268
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:27,998
So it's a coin flip.

269
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:33,571
Yeah. I guess it is.

270
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:35,305
Heads, we burn it down.

271
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,308
Okay.

272
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,827
Call Chen.

273
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:03,601
<i>Firefighters on the
scene here in the Industrial District</i>

274
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,369
<i>working to contain the blaze</i>

275
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,872
<i>before it can spread
to nearby homes and businesses.</i>

276
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,573
<i>Now at this time, Jackie,</i>

277
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:12,810
<i>officials believe
the Falcone Imports warehouse,</i>

278
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:15,579
<i>owned, of course,
by the notorious Falcone crime family,</i>

279
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:16,480
<i>to be vacant...</i>

280
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:36,000
"Two heads
are better than one."

281
00:24:47,478 --> 00:24:48,345
Gilda?

282
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:52,850
Gilda?

283
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:09,567
Hey! You scared me.

284
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,569
I came home and I didn't know
where you were.

285
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:12,703
Did you hear me calling?

286
00:25:13,938 --> 00:25:15,639
Please stay.

287
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,375
I'm not going anywhere.

288
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:19,510
I mean it.

289
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:21,412
Don't leave me.

290
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:22,913
Baby, I know
I haven't been around.

291
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:24,582
And I'm sorry.

292
00:25:24,615 --> 00:25:26,050
But this job,

293
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,551
it isn't forever.

294
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,393
Hey, we caught a huge break
tonight on this Falcone thing.

295
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:38,596
Once I take him out,

296
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:40,397
and I will take him out...

297
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:43,834
things are gonna be different.

298
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,369
We can start a family.

299
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,507
You know I can't.

300
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:51,775
Of course you can.

301
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,177
We can.

302
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,679
We'll talk about options
when you're ready,

303
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:57,548
but I need you to trust
that we're still on track.

304
00:25:58,649 --> 00:25:59,783
And that I love you.

305
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,456
Now are we still having
movie night or not?

306
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:08,959
No, don't even answer that.
Come on.

307
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,507
If we take 66th,

308
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,775
we can cut them off
at the Westward Bridge.

309
00:26:57,808 --> 00:27:00,044
No, maintain a safe distance
for now.

310
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,870
<i>Good evening, sir.
The turkey is roasting,</i>

311
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:29,740
<i>the pies are cooling
and Miss Kyle is en route.</i>

312
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,816
Alfred, make a note
to order a new windshield.

313
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:40,017
Bulletproof.

314
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,119
<i>Of course, sir, but if I may...</i>

315
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:34,972
Aah!

316
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,951
I thought
you didn't hurt people!

317
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:53,624
You thought wrong.

318
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:57,961
You and your San Ho Hui buddies

319
00:28:57,995 --> 00:29:01,031
were seen outside Harvey
Dent's house on Halloween.

320
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:02,666
We were trick-or-treating.

321
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,937
Having fun?

322
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:09,139
Not yet.

323
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:10,641
But any second now.

324
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:44,342
Ya!

325
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:54,805
Go.

326
00:31:54,838 --> 00:31:56,474
I'll keep an eye
on your little friends.

327
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:00,378
A "thank you" would be nice!

328
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:04,349
It is Thanksgiving.

329
00:32:15,092 --> 00:32:17,462
We can
make this easy, Mickey.

330
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:19,796
Just tell me
who hired you to kill Dent.

331
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,098
Go to hell, Bat-Freak.

332
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:26,471
Right now, the only difference
between you and me

333
00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:28,171
is that I know
what's down here.

334
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:35,979
Hmm.

335
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:48,925
Grundy.

336
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:52,062
He's mine.

337
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,564
Let him go.

338
00:32:57,868 --> 00:32:59,470
This is your place.

339
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:01,004
Give him to me
and I'll make sure

340
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:02,573
he never sets foot
down here again.

341
00:33:06,344 --> 00:33:07,545
You can be alone.

342
00:33:28,031 --> 00:33:31,602
Born on a Monday.

343
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:45,550
One more for ya.

344
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,950
My goodness.

345
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,119
People have been
so kind to Harvey.

346
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:54,024
Oh, this one's not
for your husband. It's for you.

347
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,563
From a "Mr. Falcone."

348
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:05,068
I-I'm sorry, ma'am.

349
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:07,003
It's none of my business...

350
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:08,473
Isn't it time for his dinner?

351
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:21,151
I don't wanna
be here, Mick.

352
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,689
My wife's cooking turkey
with all the trimmings.

353
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:28,426
I love turkey
with all the trimmings.

354
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:32,262
So, just tell us what you know about the
bomb in the district attorney's house,

355
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:33,964
then we can all go eat.

356
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,901
I don't even know
Carmine Falcone.

357
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,541
The Roman contracted your triad
to take out Harvey Dent!

358
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,476
Your signature's all over it.

359
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,347
Mickey. You gotta help me
keep my friend here calm.

360
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,114
Just give us something,

361
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:52,082
anything.

362
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:55,986
Someone's trying to frame me.

363
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:58,155
I told you. I'm innocent.

364
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:00,957
Chairs are for suspects.

365
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,660
This guy's innocent.

366
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,098
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

367
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:10,967
Hey. I thought we were
just doing a thing.

368
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:13,571
This little act doesn't get us
anywhere if the guy gets hurt.

369
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:16,741
Maybe you guys should admit
you have nothing on San Ho Hui.

370
00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:19,009
If you had, you would've
booked me already.

371
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:22,513
All right. That's it. Montoya!

372
00:35:24,147 --> 00:35:26,684
Please, show our friend out.

373
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:29,487
Maybe you should thank
whoever planted that bomb.

374
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,022
What did you say?

375
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:34,358
You still haven't figured out
who killed Johnny Viti?

376
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:38,028
Get him outta my sight.

377
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:48,238
You may be aces in a fistfight, but you've
got a lot to learn about detective work.

378
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,707
I found him, didn't I?

379
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,409
It's not just
about finding them.

380
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:53,744
You gotta know how
they're gonna help your case.

381
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:57,648
Mickey Chen is a small fish
protected by Falcone.

382
00:35:57,682 --> 00:36:00,150
We were never going
to get a confession.

383
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:04,120
We needed to make friends
and, in time, flip him.

384
00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:06,791
Keep talking like that,
they'll make you DA.

385
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:08,325
Harvey isn't dead yet.

386
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,061
And he isn't a killer, either.

387
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:13,598
No matter what
that scumbag thinks.

388
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,098
He's never even owned a gun.

389
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,535
Falcone fits.

390
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:20,538
The Roman killed Viti
and ordered the hit on Dent.

391
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:22,473
Occam's Razor.

392
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:26,377
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

393
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,746
All right, if I leave now,
I might just make dinner.

394
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,783
You should be
with your people, too.

395
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:38,556
Fine.

396
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:47,765
Good night.

397
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:51,335
Happy Thanksgiving, Mrs. Dent.

398
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,605
Now, I'm sure the missus is running
out to pick up some real food,

399
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,108
but I guarantee you, you have
never had pumpkin pie like...

400
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:02,413
Uh, Mr. Dent?

401
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:13,223
I just wanted to get out of this
city, I hate this place.

402
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:14,157
Nice.

403
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:24,134
The secret
is the basil.

404
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:27,270
You want only the youngest
leaves from the youngest plant,

405
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:29,205
otherwise it's like mint.

406
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:32,810
Overpowers everything.

407
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:35,646
We have a lot
to be thankful for, Alberto.

408
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,847
Such as?

409
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:40,351
Health. Family.

410
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,419
What's left of it.

411
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:46,122
If you are referring
to your cousin Johnny,

412
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:47,625
that is being handled.

413
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:49,527
By Mickey Chen.

414
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,799
And who do you think hired him?

415
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:57,668
Of course.

416
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:02,272
Is there something
you wish to say?

417
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,544
No, Poppa.

418
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:09,513
Except to point out that
Harvey Dent is still alive.

419
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,885
Because I allow it.

420
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,186
For now.

421
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:19,624
This.

422
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:22,325
This is what
I keep talking about.

423
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,694
This is Oxford.

424
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:25,896
That place polluted
your mind, Alberto.

425
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,600
You used to know
your place. Now?

426
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:31,502
I should have
never sent you there.

427
00:38:35,673 --> 00:38:37,808
The dangers
of independent thought.

428
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:41,946
When have you had
one independent thought

429
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:44,247
that actually benefited
this family?

430
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:47,518
Maybe when I sent flowers

431
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:48,653
to Dent's hospital room

432
00:38:48,686 --> 00:38:49,820
in the Falcone name.

433
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:52,790
You did what?

434
00:38:55,593 --> 00:38:57,227
I sent flowers.

435
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,262
I thought it would
take suspicion off of us

436
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,732
if we looked like we care
about his recovery.

437
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:04,300
Now, I suppose you'll say
it was a sloppy move.

438
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:13,309
I can forgive sloppy.

439
00:39:14,378 --> 00:39:16,614
What I will not tolerate

440
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,349
is you presuming to speak

441
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:19,884
on behalf of this family.

442
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,858
Let me be perfectly clear.

443
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:29,627
Again.

444
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,231
Any notion you may hold

445
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:36,634
about being next in line

446
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:37,568
to take over

447
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,637
our business interests

448
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,505
is a pathetic delusion.

449
00:39:50,548 --> 00:39:52,683
You are weak.

450
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,952
Your weakness is my liability.

451
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:59,523
You are to have zero contact
with Mr. or Mrs. Harvey Dent.

452
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,359
End of discussion.

453
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:55,679
Harvey!

454
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,321
Hello.

455
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:07,558
I got a call that you went
missing from the hospital.

456
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:11,595
How did I know
I'd find you here?

457
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:16,100
Couldn't stand
being cooped up anymore.

458
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:18,669
Thought I'd stretch my legs.

459
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:20,404
Yeah.

460
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,907
Listen, why don't you hop in?
I'll take you back.

461
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,643
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I like it out here.

462
00:41:28,012 --> 00:41:30,648
I'm on my way home
for Thanksgiving dinner.

463
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,349
You should come along.

464
00:41:32,383 --> 00:41:33,717
Barbara always makes a ton.

465
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:34,785
I'm not hungry.

466
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,859
Harvey, what are we doing here?

467
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:46,130
I don't know.

468
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:47,765
Maybe I wasn't ready
for this yet.

469
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:51,402
I think I'm gonna go back now.

470
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:53,070
Don't you worry about Harvey.

471
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:57,908
All right, Counselor.

472
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:06,116
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't have this.

473
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:11,155
The Falcones
are dangerous people

474
00:42:11,188 --> 00:42:13,824
and, to them,
you're the bad guy.

475
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:14,925
Protect your family.

476
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,575
So I made him an offer,
you know.

477
00:42:39,149 --> 00:42:40,985
To the family.

478
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:42,152
Those dearly departed...

479
00:42:44,455 --> 00:42:47,858
and those whom we are fortunate
to have beside us here today.

480
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:51,528
Let us be thankful for the time
we still have together

481
00:42:51,562 --> 00:42:54,431
and for the many blessings
bestowed upon us.

482
00:42:56,634 --> 00:42:59,570
- Alla salute!
- Salute!

483
00:43:10,748 --> 00:43:12,683
Ah, yes.

484
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,685
- Oh, look.
- Oh, come here!

485
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:16,854
- Oh-ho!
- Yeah!

486
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:19,690
- I told you I'd walk.
- Very good, very good.

487
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:22,159
Yeah!

488
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:24,428
- Whoo-hoo!
- Welcome back.

489
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:39,009
Barbara?

490
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:58,028
Ooh!

491
00:44:28,993 --> 00:44:30,928
Solomon Grundy...

492
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:34,865
born on a Monday...

493
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:45,876
No. Believe me. I told him
where he could stick the cape.

494
00:44:48,078 --> 00:44:49,747
Even Gordon laughed.

495
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:52,850
That's when they let me go.

496
00:45:22,713 --> 00:45:24,081
You don't
need me for this.

497
00:45:24,114 --> 00:45:25,716
I should be out hunting.

498
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:28,085
We've got it covered.

499
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:31,055
All of Gotham PD will be deployed
throughout town by midnight.

500
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:37,928
One way or another, when Holiday
comes calling, we'll be ready.

501
00:45:39,897 --> 00:45:42,699
You know, this was all you.

502
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:44,802
I wanted them
in Gotham Penitentiary.

503
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:46,870
This was Harvey.

504
00:45:47,638 --> 00:45:48,806
And he was right.

505
00:45:56,414 --> 00:45:57,848
Calendar Man.

506
00:45:59,149 --> 00:46:00,084
So...

507
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:03,921
a killer who only
works on holidays.

508
00:46:05,656 --> 00:46:07,624
And it's December 24th.

509
00:46:09,193 --> 00:46:11,895
I was wondering
when you'd get to me.

510
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:13,864
We don't have much time, Day.

511
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:16,900
Who killed Johnny Viti
on Halloween?

512
00:46:16,934 --> 00:46:20,971
The same person who killed Mickey
Chen and his crew on Thanksgiving.

513
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:24,308
We need a better answer
than that.

514
00:46:24,342 --> 00:46:27,378
Viti was The Roman's nephew.

515
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:29,613
The Roman was Chen's employer.

516
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:33,117
First suspect is, therefore,

517
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,118
The Roman.

518
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:42,759
But since sneaking around
isn't really Falcone's style,

519
00:46:42,793 --> 00:46:44,828
we move on to
the second suspect.

520
00:46:46,296 --> 00:46:49,700
Someone hoping for the fall
of The Roman empire.

521
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,338
Like Sal Maroni.

522
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:55,272
He's as good a guess
as any of the others.

523
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,041
What "others"?

524
00:47:00,077 --> 00:47:01,278
You're down a man.

525
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:05,249
This is a waste of time.

526
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:07,718
I told you to bring Mr. Dent.

527
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:09,086
He isn't safe out there.

528
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:12,923
The DA who put you all
in Arkham?

529
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:14,992
Half the patients here
would kill him on sight,

530
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:18,962
so I'd say out there
is the only place he is safe.

531
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:23,000
Perhaps.

532
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:24,902
Or perhaps he doesn't know
you're here.

533
00:47:26,437 --> 00:47:27,671
Perhaps...

534
00:47:30,073 --> 00:47:32,009
the district attorney...

535
00:47:33,511 --> 00:47:35,112
is a suspect?

536
00:47:41,185 --> 00:47:42,286
Ah.

537
00:47:44,355 --> 00:47:46,391
Well, of course.

538
00:47:46,424 --> 00:47:51,929
Intelligent, calculating, with a
mission to take down Carmine Falcone.

539
00:47:52,863 --> 00:47:53,964
It all fits.

540
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,832
Harvey Dent is not a killer.

541
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:00,904
Unless he's leading
a double life.

542
00:48:01,939 --> 00:48:04,942
Like your caped crusader here.

543
00:48:04,975 --> 00:48:07,744
Why did you ask for me?

544
00:48:07,778 --> 00:48:09,813
So you could see for yourself.

545
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:13,384
I don't have time
for your crazy.

546
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:17,187
You really don't.

547
00:48:17,221 --> 00:48:20,425
There's lots of crazy
out there these days.

548
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:26,531
And just when you thought
you'd cleaned it all up.

549
00:48:26,564 --> 00:48:29,066
What a...

550
00:48:30,535 --> 00:48:31,868
joke.

551
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:43,814
Happy holiday.

552
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:45,148
Open it!

553
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,502
He had somebody get to my kid!

554
00:49:04,535 --> 00:49:06,837
If...
If I didn't help him...

555
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:08,772
I'm sorry.

556
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:11,041
Harvey isn't safe.

557
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:11,975
Go!

565
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,384
"Gilda"!

566
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,954
She looked like a Gilda.

567
00:50:02,025 --> 00:50:03,327
Looking for this?

568
00:50:07,398 --> 00:50:09,467
Relax, lollipop!

569
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,902
Police issue.

570
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:13,571
Where's my wife?

571
00:50:13,604 --> 00:50:17,608
She's just where I left her,
last-minute shopping.

572
00:50:20,445 --> 00:50:23,481
Spoiler alert, it's socks.

573
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:24,948
What do you want?

574
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,488
Aw, I thought I was
playing Santi Claus!

575
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:32,623
Oh, all right.

576
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:36,126
I want a fire engine
and a football and...

577
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,295
to deliver a message.

578
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:44,101
Put the gun down
and we'll talk.

579
00:50:46,604 --> 00:50:48,305
Sure!

580
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:03,421
<i>Your suspicions
were correct.</i>

581
00:51:03,454 --> 00:51:06,657
<i>A Santa clown has reportedly
terrorized three families today.</i>

582
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:09,259
<i>Sir, they were
all named "Dent."</i>

583
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:18,503
Whoo!

584
00:51:39,524 --> 00:51:41,426
Where did you get that?

585
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:42,693
Why?

586
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:45,162
Ya missin' one?

587
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:48,433
You could use some cheering up!

588
00:51:48,466 --> 00:51:51,436
Have ya heard the one
about the murderous clown

589
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:58,175
that escaped the asylum and showed up
at the home of the DA who put him there?

590
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:01,512
See, there's a persistent rumor
'round these parts

591
00:52:01,546 --> 00:52:05,650
that DA Dent
is more than he appears to be.

592
00:52:07,485 --> 00:52:08,519
But there's only room

593
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:10,220
for one homicidal maniac

594
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:11,321
in this town.

595
00:52:11,355 --> 00:52:12,590
And if I hear

596
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:14,324
that Happy Harvey Dent

597
00:52:14,358 --> 00:52:16,026
is steppin' out,

598
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:18,195
I'll make sure little Gilda

599
00:52:18,228 --> 00:52:20,163
doesn't have to clothes-shop

600
00:52:20,197 --> 00:52:22,633
for hubby-wubby ever again.

601
00:52:23,668 --> 00:52:25,068
You call that a joke?

602
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:29,272
But you haven't even
heard the punchline!

603
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:30,775
It goes like this!

604
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:40,150
Harvey.

605
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:43,286
Harvey, can you hear me?

606
00:52:45,222 --> 00:52:46,724
Any idea where he was heading?

607
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:50,193
Maroni...

608
00:52:51,696 --> 00:52:53,096
<i>"monge"?</i>

609
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:17,622
What happened to your
friend's face, Maroni?

610
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:18,589
Nothin'.

611
00:53:18,623 --> 00:53:19,490
What happened to yours?

612
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:20,525
Oh, you mother...

613
00:53:20,558 --> 00:53:22,393
Tell me everything he said.

614
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:25,195
If you get off of my neck.

615
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:34,271
He was inside
before we got there.

616
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:37,107
Took out the whole staff,
poisoned the fagioli.

617
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,745
I wasn't hungry,
but, uh, Freddy here...

618
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:42,647
I dunno. Guess I'm lucky.

619
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,583
No. He let you live. Why?

620
00:53:45,616 --> 00:53:47,250
Do I look like I know?

621
00:53:47,284 --> 00:53:48,719
He put a gun in my face

622
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:50,388
and told me
that this is his turf

623
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:52,590
and that he's cracking down
on interlopers.

624
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:54,324
Maybe I should thank him.

625
00:53:56,694 --> 00:53:58,663
I don't know where you get off.

626
00:53:58,696 --> 00:54:02,433
Freaks like this clown used
to play way out on the fringe,

627
00:54:02,466 --> 00:54:03,734
but once you showed up...

628
00:54:06,169 --> 00:54:07,304
Relax, pal.

629
00:54:11,308 --> 00:54:14,378
Ya know, things used to
run smooth in this town.

630
00:54:14,412 --> 00:54:18,516
Now we got killer crocs
and moths and sewer zombies,

631
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:20,718
not to mention
a homicidal maniac

632
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:23,688
skulking around the holidays
hittin' made men.

633
00:54:26,256 --> 00:54:30,528
What's the common thread? Huh.

634
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:32,330
Where is he?

635
00:54:32,363 --> 00:54:34,332
Who knows? He's a nutjob.

636
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:36,467
But if he's the guy
killin' Falcone's men,

637
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,537
it's only a matter of time till
he gets to old Carmine himself.

638
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,871
Maybe start there.

639
00:54:42,773 --> 00:54:45,108
Not really much
of a detective, are ya?

640
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:11,869
Hello.

641
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,223
Navy, navy, charcoal, black.

642
00:55:33,256 --> 00:55:34,659
Ugh!

643
00:55:34,692 --> 00:55:38,462
Really, Carm, is a splash
of color too much to ask?

644
00:55:38,496 --> 00:55:40,296
Stop clowning around.

645
00:55:40,331 --> 00:55:42,667
If you're gonna kill me,
just do it.

646
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:46,570
Is this the face of a killer?

647
00:55:50,775 --> 00:55:52,543
Ugh!

648
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:53,978
I guess it is!

649
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:59,917
Oh, relax, <i>polpetto,</i>
I'm not going to kill you.

650
00:56:01,018 --> 00:56:03,219
Not tonight, anyway.

651
00:56:03,253 --> 00:56:04,889
It's Christmas!

652
00:56:05,823 --> 00:56:06,757
But...

653
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:10,895
someone will die tonight.

654
00:56:10,928 --> 00:56:13,698
Probably someone close to you.

655
00:56:13,731 --> 00:56:16,734
Don't you want to know
who's pulling the trigger?

656
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:21,939
Anyhoo, I just
popped in to say,

657
00:56:21,972 --> 00:56:25,376
if you hear any news about
the Holiday investigation,

658
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:27,745
I'd like you to pass it my way.

659
00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:31,515
As a professional courtesy.

660
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:34,719
Here's my card!

661
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:38,956
<i>Buon Natale!</i>

662
00:56:43,427 --> 00:56:45,896
<i>Buon Natale.</i>

663
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:47,832
Hoo!
I kill me.

664
00:56:55,473 --> 00:56:56,574
What the hell?

665
00:57:07,752 --> 00:57:09,553
Missed me!

666
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:13,491
Whoo!

667
00:57:19,463 --> 00:57:20,564
You know what I forgot?

668
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:36,914
Whoa! That was close!

669
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:44,522
Whee!

670
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,056
I would
remind you, sir,

671
00:58:52,089 --> 00:58:55,626
of Mr. Falcone's "annual benefit
for the Gotham Children's Clinic."

672
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:59,763
It would be advisable to show
your face at least one year.

673
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,932
Your father
built that hospital.

674
00:59:01,966 --> 00:59:04,735
He helped
The Roman build it.

675
00:59:04,768 --> 00:59:06,604
Still, a good cause.

676
00:59:06,637 --> 00:59:08,072
And, frankly,
a night on a yacht

677
00:59:08,105 --> 00:59:10,140
could do you some good.

678
00:59:10,174 --> 00:59:11,742
Miss Kyle will be there.

679
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,549
Three murders
on three holidays.

680
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:20,951
Each of the victims,
a Falcone associate.

681
00:59:20,985 --> 00:59:23,554
All shot with the same type
of untraceable gun.

682
00:59:23,587 --> 00:59:24,521
No witnesses.

683
00:59:25,522 --> 00:59:26,423
Suspects?

684
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:29,960
Salvatore Maroni.

685
00:59:29,994 --> 00:59:32,696
His family's always been
second to The Roman.

686
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,032
He's notoriously ambitious.

687
00:59:35,065 --> 00:59:37,935
But he's killed
Falcone's men in broad daylight.

688
00:59:37,968 --> 00:59:40,170
Why the cloak-and-dagger
Holiday business?

689
00:59:41,238 --> 00:59:43,607
Carla Viti, Falcone's sister.

690
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:45,709
Runs their Chicago operation.

691
00:59:45,743 --> 00:59:48,178
She could be making a play
for control of the family.

692
00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:50,915
By killing her
only son on Halloween?

693
00:59:50,948 --> 00:59:53,150
She is a criminal.

694
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:56,220
And he
is a homicidal maniac.

695
00:59:56,253 --> 00:59:57,721
The guard testified

696
00:59:57,755 --> 01:00:00,190
that he escaped before
the first murder.

697
01:00:00,224 --> 01:00:02,026
The Roman himself.

698
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:04,061
Johnny Viti
was about to flip

699
01:00:04,094 --> 01:00:05,629
and Mickey Chen could testify

700
01:00:05,663 --> 01:00:07,598
that Falcone ordered
Dent's murder.

701
01:00:07,631 --> 01:00:10,200
He had motive
to silence them both.

702
01:00:10,234 --> 01:00:12,536
But why kill his own bodyguard?

703
01:00:12,569 --> 01:00:15,973
May I ask why you're keeping
the fifth suspect off the board?

704
01:00:17,141 --> 01:00:19,243
Because
I don't like it.

705
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:22,646
But it fits. Doesn't it?

706
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,115
Obsessed with
taking down Falcone.

707
01:00:25,149 --> 01:00:28,886
More than boss Maroni and every
ambitious made man in town.

708
01:00:28,919 --> 01:00:31,722
He was turned down
for a gun license last year

709
01:00:31,755 --> 01:00:33,557
when the psych eval
showed some...

710
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,858
wild aberrations.

711
01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:39,630
Or is it someone else entirely?

712
01:00:39,663 --> 01:00:43,033
Someone we haven't even
considered.

713
01:00:43,067 --> 01:00:46,103
I thought this would be about
sweeping criminals off the street,

714
01:00:46,136 --> 01:00:48,772
maybe scaring them straight.

715
01:00:48,806 --> 01:00:52,242
I never thought the Batman was
going to have to be a detective.

716
01:00:52,276 --> 01:00:53,510
A good one.

717
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,016
What if I can't
save them, Alfred?

718
01:00:59,049 --> 01:01:02,086
I've seen these
growing pains before, sir,

719
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:04,655
and I am confident that,
in the end,

720
01:01:04,688 --> 01:01:07,758
the Batman will be
what the world needs him to be.

721
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,696
The same, I believe,
should be said of Bruce Wayne.

722
01:01:38,856 --> 01:01:41,158
My distinguished guests.

723
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:43,560
It is my honor
to welcome you here tonight.

724
01:01:44,595 --> 01:01:46,663
I see a lot of familiar faces.

725
01:01:46,697 --> 01:01:47,598
Mayor.

726
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:51,835
Your Eminence.

727
01:01:54,805 --> 01:01:56,740
No, I was talking
to Sal Maroni.

728
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:04,349
Sal Maroni. On my yacht.

729
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:06,717
It's like my father
always said,

730
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,786
"Keep your enemies close...

731
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:10,754
and a loaded gun closer."

732
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,097
Thirty years ago, a small group
of concerned Gothamites

733
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,166
joined together
to build something

734
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:26,236
the politicians squabbling in the
halls of government could not.

735
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:30,607
Dr. Thomas Wayne and I built the
Children's Clinic to protect families.

736
01:02:31,376 --> 01:02:33,277
And if you know me,

737
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:37,581
you know there is nothing more
important to me than family.

738
01:02:38,682 --> 01:02:40,184
So, <i>buon anno!</i>

739
01:02:40,217 --> 01:02:43,388
Thank you all for being here
and for your generosity.

740
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:46,190
Let's beat last year's total.

741
01:02:46,223 --> 01:02:49,193
Remember, cash only, please!

742
01:03:00,204 --> 01:03:03,841
Also, I would like to thank
our corporate sponsors,

743
01:03:03,874 --> 01:03:05,242
Kord Omniversal,

744
01:03:05,275 --> 01:03:07,111
Soder Cola,

745
01:03:07,144 --> 01:03:10,814
and for the 10th year running,
Gotham Broadcasting Company.

746
01:03:12,082 --> 01:03:13,418
Oh! Oh...

747
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:15,052
Oh, I'm so sorry!

748
01:03:15,085 --> 01:03:16,354
Here, let me.

749
01:03:16,387 --> 01:03:19,223
I have it. Thank you.

750
01:03:19,256 --> 01:03:21,992
No, thank you.

751
01:03:22,025 --> 01:03:26,331
One more thing, and then I
promise I'll let you enjoy the party.

752
01:03:26,364 --> 01:03:28,298
I would like
to acknowledge someone.

753
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:32,403
As I said, nothing is more
important to me than family.

754
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:34,439
And perhaps my one regret

755
01:03:34,472 --> 01:03:40,277
is making this man feel like he
is not a part of this family.

756
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,646
We have not always
agreed on details.

757
01:03:44,148 --> 01:03:48,353
But we agree
on the most important things.

758
01:03:48,386 --> 01:03:50,355
We believe in family.

759
01:03:53,123 --> 01:03:56,293
We believe in business.

760
01:03:56,326 --> 01:03:58,996
And like
all of you here tonight,

761
01:03:59,029 --> 01:04:02,099
we believe in Gotham City.

762
01:04:03,434 --> 01:04:05,068
Ladies and gentlemen,

763
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:06,770
the son I never had,

764
01:04:07,905 --> 01:04:09,440
Mr. Bruce Wayne.

765
01:04:46,176 --> 01:04:48,479
- I think I see them!
- Wh-What?

766
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:51,748
As if it matters!
I hardly ever see you anyway!

767
01:04:51,782 --> 01:04:53,484
I'm just saying,
there's no need to...

768
01:04:53,518 --> 01:04:54,718
Hey, Harvey!

769
01:05:01,258 --> 01:05:03,293
Shouldn't you
be working, Captain?

770
01:05:03,327 --> 01:05:05,295
I am.

771
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:08,131
This is the largest police
presence this city's ever seen.

772
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:10,133
We got caught with our
pants down on Christmas,

773
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:12,437
but Heaven help Holiday if he
tries anything here tonight.

774
01:05:16,006 --> 01:05:17,941
Always on duty!

775
01:05:17,975 --> 01:05:19,544
Always.

776
01:05:19,577 --> 01:05:21,346
You didn't
bring the kids?

777
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:22,447
They're sleeping over

778
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,114
at my mother's tonight.

779
01:05:24,147 --> 01:05:26,484
We should try and hire you
to sit next time, Gilda.

780
01:05:26,517 --> 01:05:28,519
I bet you're great with kids.

781
01:05:28,553 --> 01:05:30,954
I haven't worked
as a sitter in years.

782
01:05:30,988 --> 01:05:34,024
It paid her way
through law school.

783
01:05:34,057 --> 01:05:35,158
I didn't know you're a lawyer.

784
01:05:35,192 --> 01:05:36,361
I was.

785
01:05:37,428 --> 01:05:38,829
Now I'm not anything.

786
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:46,303
Dead pilot? Check!

787
01:05:48,038 --> 01:05:50,007
Ground crew? Check!

788
01:05:51,576 --> 01:05:54,911
Poison gas? Check!

789
01:05:56,514 --> 01:05:59,216
Time to ring in the new year.

790
01:06:06,591 --> 01:06:10,528
Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seatbelts

791
01:06:10,561 --> 01:06:14,965
as I have no idea
how to fly this thing!

792
01:06:31,048 --> 01:06:32,916
Looks
like a real party.

793
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:34,284
So what the hell
are we doing here?

794
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:38,088
I don't know.

795
01:06:38,121 --> 01:06:40,425
Something tells me this is
where I need to be tonight.

796
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:46,930
We...

797
01:06:46,963 --> 01:06:48,899
Look,
we haven't talked,

798
01:06:48,932 --> 01:06:50,435
and I think we should.

799
01:06:52,169 --> 01:06:54,071
I feel like whatever this is...

800
01:06:54,104 --> 01:06:58,875
whatever we've tried to be to
one another is... unraveling.

801
01:07:00,177 --> 01:07:02,079
And we both know why.

802
01:07:04,147 --> 01:07:05,916
We've never spoken of it,

803
01:07:05,949 --> 01:07:09,387
but the truth is that you and I
are two different people.

804
01:07:10,688 --> 01:07:12,189
It was fun to try,

805
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,592
but I don't think we're ever

806
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:15,959
gonna be able
to put it all together.

807
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:20,431
I guess we're just
not cut out for...

808
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:22,633
whatever this is.

809
01:07:24,067 --> 01:07:25,102
Was.

810
01:07:34,945 --> 01:07:36,647
Don't worry, though.

811
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:38,315
I'll see you on the other side.

812
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:52,028
When did you do it?

813
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:54,532
Do what?

814
01:07:54,565 --> 01:07:57,535
You took my watch
without me noticing.

815
01:07:57,568 --> 01:07:59,936
So when did you do it?
I'm curious.

816
01:08:01,472 --> 01:08:03,441
Take it from me, Bruce,

817
01:08:03,474 --> 01:08:06,910
around here,
curiosity can get you killed.

818
01:08:15,586 --> 01:08:16,521
Not now.

819
01:08:19,222 --> 01:08:20,090
What?

820
01:08:21,258 --> 01:08:22,125
Where?

821
01:08:27,532 --> 01:08:29,166
I just want to have
a normal night.

822
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:30,701
Can we just have
a normal night?

823
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:33,136
I don't even know
what that is anymore!

824
01:08:34,204 --> 01:08:36,106
I am alone here.

825
01:08:38,074 --> 01:08:39,577
I told myself it was okay

826
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:40,678
because it would get better,

827
01:08:40,711 --> 01:08:41,646
but it hasn't!

828
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:45,081
You don't have to be alone!

829
01:08:45,115 --> 01:08:46,918
We've talked about
having a baby.

830
01:08:47,652 --> 01:08:49,085
I can't!

831
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:50,588
You know that I can't!

832
01:08:50,621 --> 01:08:52,390
Maybe not
the old-fashioned way,

833
01:08:52,423 --> 01:08:54,124
but that doesn't mean
that we can't try something...

834
01:08:54,157 --> 01:08:55,992
I don't want it!

835
01:08:56,026 --> 01:08:57,728
I don't want it because I can't

836
01:08:57,762 --> 01:09:01,131
and I can't
because I don't want it!

837
01:09:01,164 --> 01:09:03,501
Can we please
talk about this in private?

838
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:07,638
Jesus, why can't you
be more like...

839
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:11,174
More like who?

840
01:09:16,246 --> 01:09:18,048
I'm only one man.

841
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:19,149
I can't do this.

842
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,318
Not now.

843
01:09:25,322 --> 01:09:26,390
Excuse us.

844
01:09:29,427 --> 01:09:32,497
Jim, did you know they're
having these kinds of problems?

845
01:09:33,296 --> 01:09:34,264
Jim?

846
01:09:34,297 --> 01:09:35,700
Yeah. I see it now.

847
01:09:35,733 --> 01:09:38,101
Huh?

848
01:09:38,134 --> 01:09:39,403
What's going on?

849
01:09:42,773 --> 01:09:44,207
Crappy New Year!

850
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,421
Hey!

851
01:10:10,635 --> 01:10:16,641
<i>♪ Should all offenses be
forgot And never brought to trial... ♪</i>

852
01:10:18,442 --> 01:10:22,145
Oh, silly me! The safety! Ha!

853
01:10:26,717 --> 01:10:29,252
Ooh, pretty!

854
01:10:39,697 --> 01:10:40,798
Huh?

855
01:10:46,202 --> 01:10:47,672
Well, shit.

856
01:10:54,412 --> 01:10:57,782
Economy class ain't what
she used to be! Ha!

857
01:11:04,488 --> 01:11:05,890
This area
needs to be clear!

858
01:11:05,923 --> 01:11:07,425
Everyone
remain calm!

859
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:08,392
This way!

860
01:11:10,528 --> 01:11:12,697
- Pearce!
- Captain, sir!

861
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:14,365
I need to get my wife
out of here!

862
01:11:14,932 --> 01:11:16,166
Yes, sir!

863
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:17,167
Follow me, ma'am.

864
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,493
What are you trying to prove
with this stunt, Joker?

865
01:11:42,526 --> 01:11:45,429
Prove? Stunt? Joker?

866
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:47,598
No, wait,
that one's right.

867
01:11:47,632 --> 01:11:49,533
- Why did you kill Johnny Viti?
- What?

868
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:51,802
And Mickey Chen
and Milos Grappa?

869
01:11:51,836 --> 01:11:54,772
You think I'm Holiday?

870
01:11:54,805 --> 01:11:58,476
Oh, poppet,
I didn't know you cared!

871
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:05,483
Of course I'm not Holiday!

872
01:12:05,516 --> 01:12:07,885
If I were him, why would I be
trying to kill him?

873
01:12:08,586 --> 01:12:09,620
Kill him?

874
01:12:09,654 --> 01:12:11,722
He's the competition!

875
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:14,492
And, like the corn kernel
always says,

876
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:16,727
"I won't be number two."

877
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:28,238
If it's Holiday you want dead,

878
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:30,541
then why gas everyone
in Gotham Square?

879
01:12:30,574 --> 01:12:32,743
Half the city's down there!

880
01:12:32,777 --> 01:12:36,514
Which means Holiday
either is or isn't!

881
01:12:36,547 --> 01:12:38,983
I have a fifty-fifty chance.

882
01:12:39,016 --> 01:12:43,319
And if I fail, well, at least I've
killed a lot of innocent people.

883
01:12:51,327 --> 01:12:52,496
No, don't kill me!

884
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,764
Not before I find out

885
01:12:53,798 --> 01:12:54,699
who Holiday is!

886
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:57,868
Why do you care?

887
01:12:57,902 --> 01:13:00,705
Oh, you adorable fool.

888
01:13:00,738 --> 01:13:02,540
Don't you know by now?

889
01:13:02,573 --> 01:13:04,842
I'm just like you!

890
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:07,812
We both love a good puzzle.

891
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:20,524
So...

892
01:13:20,558 --> 01:13:22,426
when the clock strikes 12:00,

893
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,628
do I get a little kiss?

894
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,508
Whoop!

895
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:38,642
Taking that as a "no."

896
01:14:07,905 --> 01:14:10,674
There goes my resolution.

897
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:11,609
Ha!

898
01:14:15,546 --> 01:14:17,581
Out of the way. Now! Move!

899
01:14:38,369 --> 01:14:39,537
Alberto, right?

900
01:14:42,406 --> 01:14:43,073
Selina.

901
01:14:47,378 --> 01:14:49,446
Can I ask you a question?

902
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,851
I'm trying to imagine what it's
like to grow up around all this.

903
01:14:53,884 --> 01:14:56,020
I wouldn't know.

904
01:14:56,053 --> 01:15:00,491
"Mr. Family" had me in boarding
schools overseas before I could walk.

905
01:15:00,524 --> 01:15:01,859
Which is fine.

906
01:15:01,892 --> 01:15:03,694
I would have never
fit in here anyway.

907
01:15:04,929 --> 01:15:06,630
I'm an Oxford graduate

908
01:15:06,664 --> 01:15:08,465
who's learned
more about business

909
01:15:08,499 --> 01:15:11,836
than my father could ever
hope to understand, yet...

910
01:15:11,869 --> 01:15:13,704
You don't get a seat
at the table.

911
01:15:14,572 --> 01:15:16,140
Because I'm "weak."

912
01:15:16,173 --> 01:15:17,508
I fell in love.

913
01:15:18,409 --> 01:15:20,511
How is that weak?

914
01:15:20,544 --> 01:15:22,813
She was
the wrong woman.

915
01:15:22,847 --> 01:15:24,448
Wrong for the family.

916
01:15:25,149 --> 01:15:27,618
Wrong for him.

917
01:15:27,651 --> 01:15:30,621
And, back then,
I was so desperate for his approval.

918
01:15:32,723 --> 01:15:33,991
What happened to her?

919
01:15:36,594 --> 01:15:37,995
Terrible things.

920
01:15:38,028 --> 01:15:40,898
I let him...
scare her away from me.

921
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:44,869
Which, ironically, only proved that he
was right about me in the first place.

922
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:48,606
Weak. An embarrassment.

923
01:15:50,074 --> 01:15:51,809
I'm sorry, I don't mean to...

924
01:15:55,813 --> 01:15:58,883
Why do I feel
like I can talk to you?

925
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:00,684
Uh... I, um...

926
01:16:01,986 --> 01:16:03,020
I just...

927
01:16:06,624 --> 01:16:07,791
Oh! No! No...

928
01:16:07,825 --> 01:16:09,627
Oh! No! I'm sorry, I...

929
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,662
I can't... We can't...

930
01:16:11,695 --> 01:16:12,997
Get away from her.

931
01:16:18,002 --> 01:16:19,503
Bruce!

932
01:16:19,536 --> 01:16:23,107
Wait. Bruce? Wayne?

933
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,576
Bruce Wayne is...
is the Batman?

934
01:16:25,609 --> 01:16:28,212
And Alberto Falcone is Holiday.

935
01:16:28,245 --> 01:16:30,080
Surprises all around.

936
01:16:30,114 --> 01:16:33,918
Me? You've been fed
some bad clues, Bruce.

937
01:16:33,951 --> 01:16:36,620
But I still solved the puzzle.

938
01:16:36,654 --> 01:16:41,825
The rejected son, born to inherit
an empire, but cast aside.

939
01:16:42,626 --> 01:16:44,228
You're wrong.

940
01:16:44,261 --> 01:16:47,564
You knew you'd never be
handed the keys to the kingdom,

941
01:16:47,598 --> 01:16:51,168
so you manufactured a crisis
that targets the family business.

942
01:16:51,201 --> 01:16:52,770
What?

943
01:16:52,803 --> 01:16:55,506
With potential successors
dropping like flies,

944
01:16:55,539 --> 01:16:57,841
Poppa tightened the circle
to family only,

945
01:16:57,875 --> 01:17:00,945
and for the first time,
you were on the inside.

946
01:17:02,846 --> 01:17:05,516
I don't want control
of the family!

947
01:17:05,549 --> 01:17:06,817
I never did!

948
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:11,121
Ten! Nine! Eight!
Seven! Six! Five!

949
01:17:11,155 --> 01:17:14,658
- I would happily trade that for a normal life!
- Four! Three!

950
01:17:14,692 --> 01:17:17,594
- To spend my days as far away from Gotham as possible.
- Two! One! Happy New Year!

951
01:17:17,628 --> 01:17:18,862
To get married,

952
01:17:18,896 --> 01:17:20,097
and have a child with...

953
01:17:28,672 --> 01:17:29,773
Oh, my God!

954
01:17:51,595 --> 01:17:52,663
You couldn't know.

955
01:17:54,098 --> 01:17:55,933
You're missing so many pieces.

956
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,814
Come on.

957
01:19:55,853 --> 01:19:57,754
Jim, what the hell
are we doing?

958
01:19:58,755 --> 01:19:59,690
Oh.

959
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,798
The divers will be fishing out
parts of Alberto Falcone for days.

960
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:09,867
Five-bladed prop
on its slowest speed.

961
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:12,069
Hell of a way to go.

962
01:20:12,102 --> 01:20:14,238
That isn't how he went.

963
01:20:14,271 --> 01:20:17,408
He was shot by Holiday
before going overboard.

964
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:19,377
Hang on.

965
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:21,111
Alberto wasn't Holiday?

966
01:20:21,145 --> 01:20:22,813
I thought he was.

967
01:20:22,846 --> 01:20:25,416
It was Occam's Razor, Jim,
the simplest solution.

968
01:20:26,717 --> 01:20:27,918
But it was wrong.

969
01:20:30,053 --> 01:20:31,855
I went there
for Alberto Falcone.

970
01:20:33,358 --> 01:20:35,726
I thought I was supposed
to stop him,

971
01:20:35,759 --> 01:20:38,662
but... I was supposed
to save him.

972
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:43,300
He was innocent.
And now he's dead.

973
01:20:45,436 --> 01:20:47,037
I needed to be better.

974
01:20:49,374 --> 01:20:50,741
We all did.

975
01:20:51,742 --> 01:20:52,843
All of us.

976
01:20:54,412 --> 01:20:57,314
You have to put a protective
detail on Carmine Falcone.

977
01:20:57,348 --> 01:20:59,417
If he'll even let you.

978
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:02,753
Do you realize we started out
trying to take down The Roman,

979
01:21:02,786 --> 01:21:04,489
and now we're trying
to save him?

980
01:21:04,522 --> 01:21:06,323
When did that happen?

981
01:21:06,357 --> 01:21:07,991
I have a better question.

982
01:21:08,025 --> 01:21:11,895
If Alberto Falcone
wasn't Holiday, then who is?

983
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:14,164
And who's next?

984
01:24:01,932 --> 01:24:06,903
Grant that our brother may sleep
here in peace until You awaken him to glory,

985
01:24:06,937 --> 01:24:10,173
for You are the resurrection
and the life.

986
01:24:10,207 --> 01:24:12,377
Then he will see You
face to face

987
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:15,346
and in Your light
will see light

988
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,582
and know the splendor of God.

989
01:24:17,615 --> 01:24:19,116
Amen.

990
01:24:19,149 --> 01:24:20,385
Amen.

991
01:24:37,267 --> 01:24:38,369
Bruce.

992
01:24:39,136 --> 01:24:40,137
A word.

993
01:24:41,406 --> 01:24:44,040
Carmine.
If there's anything I can do...

994
01:24:44,074 --> 01:24:45,676
You know what I want you to do,

995
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,245
but time and time again
you refuse me.

996
01:24:50,348 --> 01:24:53,651
The Wayne Foundation isn't a money
laundering outfit for the mob.

997
01:24:53,684 --> 01:24:56,587
And it won't be,
so long as I'm in control.

998
01:25:00,023 --> 01:25:01,057
Of course.

999
01:25:03,126 --> 01:25:05,162
Oh, how rude of me.

1000
01:25:05,195 --> 01:25:07,097
I don't believe
you've met my associate.

1001
01:25:09,266 --> 01:25:10,381
Charmed.

1002
01:25:23,773 --> 01:25:28,773
