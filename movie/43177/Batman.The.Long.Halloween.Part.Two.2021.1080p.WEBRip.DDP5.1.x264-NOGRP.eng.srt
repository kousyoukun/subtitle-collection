1
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,502
Tell me this never has to end.

2
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:41,078
All things wither, Bruce,
but if we're lucky... not for a long time.

3
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,687
Aren't you forgetting something?

4
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,595
Again?

5
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,672
I can't resist you.

6
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,953
No man can.

7
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:30,781
You've been a good boy.

8
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:34,385
The foundation
was such a burden to you,

9
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,223
to us... just like
the rest of the company.

10
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:48,598
You know what you have to do
so we can be together.

11
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,882
Mr. Wayne, I think you've
over fed your philodendron.

12
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,070
Stop!

13
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,687
This isn't you, Bruce.
She's controlling you somehow.

14
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,826
Oh, hell. Sorry!

15
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:23,754
Oh.

16
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:33,564
How did you know?

17
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,800
Well, you haven't exactly
been discreet.

18
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:40,804
Appearing with Ivy in public and
signing assets over to the Roman.

19
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:44,775
I'll wake the lawyers, sir.

20
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,312
Police will be here any minute.

21
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,465
Tell them everything you
remember and then get to bed.

22
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:52,248
You look awful.

23
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,953
I told you
I don't want a partner.

24
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:00,357
You sure wanted one
these past three months.

25
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:04,328
Three months?

26
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:07,564
It took a while to catch the jolly
green jezebel with her guard down.

27
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:11,268
- And holiday?
- Still at large.

28
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,252
Gilda, I'm sorry.
We'll make the late movie.

29
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,154
I'm looking forward to it.

30
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,356
I think I'd like to go home.

31
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:33,557
Why? We can...

32
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,194
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

33
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,116
Jesus!

34
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:01,584
Harvey...

35
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:04,954
You were right.

36
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,295
Chong's been supplying holiday
with his guns.

37
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:20,003
You should have listened to me,
Jim, moved on this guy sooner.

38
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,005
We might have learned something.

39
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,875
The holiday killer's
covering his tracks.

40
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:28,611
Mother's day.

41
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:30,881
This one snuck up on us.

42
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:32,982
Sure did.

43
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:35,685
Where's our friend?

44
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,088
Who helped you escape?

45
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:13,090
Give me a name or I'll...

46
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,095
It was my mother.

47
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,433
That's who helped me.

48
00:11:56,467 --> 00:12:00,437
I strangled the old witch
years ago,

49
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:07,010
but I think she still watches
over handsome little jonny.

50
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,622
Happy mother's day.

51
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:29,632
Mother.

52
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:42,311
Through here.

53
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:49,358
Sweetheart,
I don't know if this is the...

54
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:54,792
Take what you want.
Don't hurt us.

55
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:02,693
Is he okay?

56
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,194
I don't care. Let's go.

57
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,240
Bruce, what are you doing?

58
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:24,448
Mother?

59
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:26,683
We have to get you home.

60
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:38,494
Bruce!

61
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,331
Where... where is she, Alfred?

62
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,770
- She?
- My... my mother.

63
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:48,806
I was with my mother.

64
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,882
Up we go.

65
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,263
<i>Gotham police
are searching for two inmates</i>

66
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:15,699
<i>that escaped
from arkham asylum last night.</i>

67
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:19,703
<i>One of them, Dr. Jonathan
crane, aka the scarecrow,</i>

68
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,572
<i>stole one of arkham's horses
from the grounds.</i>

69
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,776
<i>He's considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

70
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,811
<i>Anyone with knowledge
of his whereabouts</i>

71
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,881
<i>needs to call the Gotham pd
hotline right away.</i>

72
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:32,215
<i>Again, he's considered
highly dangerous.</i>

73
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:35,317
Wait.

74
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:38,756
I packed your lunch.

75
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,631
Thanks. I gotta go.

76
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,357
I've come to see my father.

77
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:20,330
It's a tie.

78
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:26,503
And, yes,
my parole officer knows I'm here.

79
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,284
Sofia, my little girl.

80
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,355
Heat give you
any trouble downstairs?

81
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:48,692
There's more cops here than I ever
saw in ten years on the inside.

82
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:53,563
"Holiday detail." For my
protection, or so they tell me.

83
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,501
- Listen, I'm very busy, so...
- That's why I need to talk to you.

84
00:16:57,534 --> 00:17:00,737
Poppa, I want to be in the room.

85
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:02,774
Sofia, we have
already discussed...

86
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:05,509
I executed the crane escape
like you ordered.

87
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:07,511
And this foolish war
with sal maroni, I think...

88
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:08,712
<i>Basta!</i>

89
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:17,755
Things... are strained.

90
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:25,029
Half our top earners have been taken
out by either holiday or maroni.

91
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:30,333
We had a chance with Wayne, but now
that he's out, we have to restructure.

92
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:34,404
That is exactly why you need me.

93
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:38,508
I do not.

94
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:44,347
Sofia, if I bring you in now, our new earners
will think I am lining up a successor.

95
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:47,584
And that will make me
look old... and weak.

96
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:50,720
You are neither.

97
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:53,423
Nevertheless.

98
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:02,532
Good. End of discussion.

99
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:07,370
Now go buy something.

100
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:11,943
Big, flashy. A dress, a car. I don't care.
Just make sure everybody sees it.

101
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,550
Happy father's day, poppa.

102
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,800
Awful business at first Gotham.

103
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,567
How do you know
it was the scarecrow?

104
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,837
Crane recently fled arkham.

105
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,706
Gases all of his victims with a
fear-inducing neurotoxin, so...

106
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,574
Yeah, you can't really miss him.

107
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:48,545
- Look, so, Mr. Wayne...
- It's Bruce.

108
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:51,883
Can I get you anything?
Alfred makes a terrific Mai Tai.

109
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,486
It's 8:30 in the mor...

110
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,790
No... no, thank you.

111
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,525
We have some questions
about new year's Eve.

112
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,728
The night Alberto Falcone
was murdered.

113
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:06,730
Harvey here was updating
the files.

114
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:08,775
And it seems that you were the
only passenger on that yacht

115
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,600
who didn't give us a statement.

116
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,469
Afraid I'm not much help.

117
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:15,039
I left the party before all
the commotion in a dinghy.

118
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,641
You probably noticed
it was missing.

119
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:20,845
Of course, I'd have given you
a statement anyway,

120
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:23,114
except that it would have been
a matter of public record

121
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:26,817
and could place my name next to that
of the young lady I went to meet.

122
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:29,086
I don't think her husband
likes me very much.

123
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,587
That's very convenient.

124
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,023
Well, not for her husband.

125
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,995
Here's what
I'm trying to understand.

126
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,998
You recently signed over
significant areas of your business

127
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:44,701
- to carmine Falcone.
- That's all been reversed.

128
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:47,939
And I was drugged and manipulated,
if that's what you mean.

129
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:49,706
Was your father drugged
and manipulated

130
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:51,842
when he went into business
with the Roman?

131
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,743
You know everything
that monster is today

132
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,680
was born of the legitimacy
handed him by the name Wayne...

133
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,816
Harvey.

134
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:02,019
It's all right. Yes,
my father built hospitals with Falcone...

135
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:05,790
But the only influence
he was under

136
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:09,894
was an overwhelming desire
to save innocent lives.

137
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,629
And how many other innocent lives
did he end up trading for it?

138
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:16,901
Two... that I know of.

139
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,591
Please help my son.

140
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,060
I have nowhere else to go.

141
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:46,764
- This way! Over here.
- Onto the desk.

142
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:52,837
Looks like four...
No, five bullet wounds to the chest.

143
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,573
You shouldn't have come here.
Your son needs to be in a hospital.

144
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:59,243
Where Luigi maroni could
find him and finish the job?

145
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:02,313
No, Dr. Wayne, please.

146
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,248
Carmine is my only son.

147
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,651
I'll do what I can.

148
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,823
- Alfred, get my bag.
- Right away, sir.

149
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:30,007
He's stable, but I don't want
to move him yet.

150
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,077
<i>Grazie.</i> I can never repay you.

151
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,679
He isn't out of the woods.

152
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,049
Come on,
we have to let him rest.

153
00:21:58,169 --> 00:21:59,170
You shouldn't be here.

154
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:02,373
It's okay.

155
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,874
Do you know who my father is?

156
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:06,376
The Roman?

157
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,680
Smart kid.

158
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,183
So you know who I'm going to be?

159
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:14,851
The Roman.

160
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,089
Very smart.

161
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,259
You remind me of my boy.

162
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,929
Your pop saved my life.

163
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,165
I guess that makes us family.

164
00:22:31,202 --> 00:22:33,003
It fell out of your pocket.

165
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:35,039
My insurance policy.

166
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:36,841
There's a lot of bad people
out there.

167
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,176
Criminals.

168
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,680
And everybody knows criminals
are superstitious.

169
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:49,186
Sometimes all it takes to get out of a
bad situation is a good flip of the coin.

170
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,821
It didn't work for you tonight?

171
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,992
Yeah.

172
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,995
Still, two heads
are better than one.

173
00:22:58,896 --> 00:22:59,896
No?

174
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:03,867
Keep it, kid.

175
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:07,338
All we get is all we take.

176
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:14,778
I was eight when Dr. Thomas Wayne
pulled Luigi maroni's bullets

177
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:16,013
out of Falcone's chest.

178
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:23,454
My father was dead by a
mobster's hand within a year.

179
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,757
Any connection between my family
and the Roman died then, too.

180
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:31,762
Thank you for stopping by.
If there's nothing else...

181
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,734
Gentlemen,
these are the names and addresses

182
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:42,406
for those who can account for master Wayne's
whereabouts on the night in question.

183
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:46,709
A lot of names on here.
Must have been quite a night.

184
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:50,915
Yes, well, a man was murdered.

185
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:54,251
Let us hope your respective
offices can deliver for him

186
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:57,254
the justice still denied
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

187
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:01,325
What happened to them
was a tragedy.

188
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:06,063
And all the more reason why your boss
should stay away from men like Falcone.

189
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,399
Will there ever be a time
when the sins of fathers

190
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:10,733
don't fall to their sons
for redemption?

191
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:12,937
Good day.

192
00:24:18,142 --> 00:24:22,913
They're going to be watching my every move
today to confirm that I'm not the killer.

193
00:24:22,947 --> 00:24:24,281
Then you'll be staying in?

194
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,718
No, just pay off
some more alibis.

195
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:32,021
I have to go to work.

196
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,905
Sit tight.

197
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,458
If he knew about us,
it would kill him.

198
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:52,343
I'll be right here, love.

199
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:07,992
Your favorite cannolis.

200
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:12,096
Cannoli. Cannolo for one,
cannoli for a box.

201
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:14,164
Your Italian is <i>sterco.</i>

202
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:16,467
I know, poppa. I'm sorry.

203
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,903
Yeah. You bring cannoli
on father's day, I forgive.

204
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,038
Sit.

205
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:24,107
So...

206
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,313
This war with Falcone.
It's killing us, pop.

207
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:32,583
Carmine thinks we've got something
to do with this... this holiday jerk.

208
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,818
<i>Sciocchezze.</i>

209
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:39,156
Carmine's paranoia is not to do
with holiday but with the new da.

210
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:42,059
Unless these two are one
and the same.

211
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:47,831
Dent's a crusader but I can't
see him getting his hands dirty.

212
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,234
More likely the bat.

213
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:55,105
You want advice? Win or lose,

214
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:58,976
the only thing that ends war
is peace.

215
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:01,345
Make peace with carmine?

216
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,481
Poppa...

217
00:26:06,183 --> 00:26:07,318
I don't know.

218
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:08,351
I don't...

219
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:12,955
Poppa!

220
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:17,427
Poppa!

221
00:26:41,552 --> 00:26:42,552
Sal!

222
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:44,955
I heard a gunshot.

223
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:46,622
Are you okay?

224
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:48,925
What happened?

225
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:58,162
Strange place to do business.

226
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:01,365
Guessing it's the last spot the
pigs leave you alone these days.

227
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:42,673
Working late?

228
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:44,475
How the hell
did you get through security?

229
00:28:50,514 --> 00:28:52,416
You were with him, right?

230
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:56,086
I needed to put an end to the
stupid war with the falcones.

231
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:00,491
My father's last words to me were that
I should make peace with my enemy.

232
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,129
At first I thought
he meant carmine,

233
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,299
but Luigi maroni
would have never wanted that.

234
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:14,538
There's only one other thing
he could have meant, so...

235
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:26,049
I'm here to make peace with the law.
Cut a deal.

236
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,285
You want Falcone
and I got plenty on him.

237
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,700
Enough to put him away for good.

238
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:39,831
In exchange for...

239
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:42,699
Dropping all outstanding
warrants against me and my men.

240
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:46,403
You want Falcone?

241
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:50,407
That's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

242
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:56,046
Tell you what.
Heads, I'll take it.

243
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:28,579
I expected a low turnout
after the new year's fiasco.

244
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:32,482
- But this is really pathetic.
- Fine by me.

245
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:35,319
The more people stay home,
the easier my job gets.

246
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:37,154
Speaking of jobs getting easier,

247
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:38,823
is it true you got maroni?

248
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:40,758
It's not a done deal.

249
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,894
My office is working out
the details now.

250
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:45,696
But if ol' sal tells a judge
what he's told me...

251
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:47,664
Let's just say today's
a good day for the Roman

252
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:50,133
to celebrate
what's left of his freedom.

253
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,072
Speak of the devil.

254
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:07,551
I'm surprised to find you
outdoors on a holiday.

255
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:09,921
- Dent.
- Falcone.

256
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:13,390
Actually, I was speaking
to your wife... Mrs. Dent.

257
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:14,423
Don't touch her.

258
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:20,330
I never took you
for a patriot, carmine.

259
00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:22,800
Oh, I wouldn't miss fireworks
like this for all the world.

260
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,838
Good evening,
Mrs. Dent, captain.

261
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:28,806
Evening.

262
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:42,486
I tell you, harv, if I could, I'd have
every cop in the city here tonight.

263
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,897
See you on the other side.

264
00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:13,845
Utter
inanity proved his insanity

265
00:33:13,878 --> 00:33:17,247
while he rattled
a couple of bones.

266
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:35,565
I've been thinking about it
and maybe you're right.

267
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,534
Uh, about what?

268
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,942
Having kids.

269
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:55,753
Stay down.

270
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:02,392
Get to Gordon. I'll be back.

271
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:04,962
Harvey, no. Harvey!

272
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,684
Get out of here.

273
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:30,755
Not till I know why this
scumbag is trying to kill me.

274
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:34,624
If I was trying to kill you,
you'd would be dead already.

275
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,995
Then what are you...

276
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:48,039
That's enough.

277
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:54,812
Someone's trying
to provoke you, dent.

278
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,080
Into doing what?

279
00:34:57,782 --> 00:34:59,382
Good question...

280
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:08,052
<i>Get up.</i>

281
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:11,923
The walrus and the carpenter

282
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:14,825
were walking close at hand.

283
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:20,798
They wept like anything
to see such quantities of sand.

284
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:25,169
"If seven maids with seven mops
swept it for half a year,

285
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:30,775
"do you suppose," the walrus said,
"that they could get it clear?"

286
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:33,710
Huh... I doubt it.

287
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:41,551
There...

288
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:45,522
That's the drop.

289
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,861
As for the bat,

290
00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:53,764
delivering him
wasn't part of the deal.

291
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:58,702
So we can do
whatever we want with him.

292
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:02,106
What fun.

293
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,849
Twinkle, twinkle little bat...

294
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:18,155
How I wonder what you're...

295
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:22,193
Your business with the Roman
ends tonight.

296
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,230
No.

297
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:38,575
Poor little thing.
Such a tiny little thing.

298
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:09,240
No.

299
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:16,646
- Down here.
- What do you got?

300
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,882
<i>Run!</i>

301
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,689
<i>Motive means opportunity.</i>

302
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:28,625
<i>Dent. All right,
let me be clear,</i>

303
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:31,929
<i>this freak is done
terrorizing my family. Done!</i>

304
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:35,099
<i>You expect us to believe that
a respected public servant...</i>

305
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:38,735
- I don't know why you watch that garbage.
- Is it true?

306
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:40,137
You believe this bs?

307
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:42,039
Is that why you want a divorce?

308
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:44,942
I never said that.
I have been talking about therapy.

309
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:49,313
Maybe divorce isn't so bad,
now that you can't go back to him...

310
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:51,215
<i>Ungrateful bitch.</i>

311
00:38:55,652 --> 00:38:58,588
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

312
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:02,692
I'm going to be late for court.

313
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,100
You left the basement door
open again.

314
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:11,769
I haven't been
in the basement today.

315
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,080
Mr. Dent?

316
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:02,386
Mr. Dent,
are you ready to proceed?

317
00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:05,688
Uh, yes.
Yes, your honor. Thank you.

318
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:07,224
<i>Murderer.</i>

319
00:40:07,258 --> 00:40:08,359
What?

320
00:40:12,062 --> 00:40:15,732
I asked if you're ready,
Mr. Dent.

321
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:18,369
Yes, of course.

322
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:23,740
Mr. Maroni, you have
confessed to 19 counts...

323
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:24,775
<i>Confess.</i>

324
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:31,882
What the hell is he...

325
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:35,386
He's here, captain. The roof.

326
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:39,256
Mr. District attorney,
we are all waiting.

327
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,059
Uh, yes, yes. Sorry, your honor.

328
00:40:46,997 --> 00:40:49,066
Rooftop really necessary?

329
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:51,101
I thought you'd want privacy.

330
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:53,204
Harvey's starting
to lose it down there.

331
00:40:53,237 --> 00:40:56,240
I think all this holiday speculation
in the press is finally getting to...

332
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:59,810
Privacy? Why?

333
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:04,949
Where'd you find them?

334
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,284
You're not going to like it.

335
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:11,055
Uh, yeah.

336
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:13,057
I hit Frankie gazzo
and his brother Lenny.

337
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,526
Tossed their bodies
in the Gotham river.

338
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:18,462
Lots of wise guys you're
looking for are in there.

339
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:22,032
Maybe that's why I got an ulcer.
You know, from drinking the water?

340
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:29,173
And didn't you commit
these murders and felonies

341
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:33,310
under direct orders from
carmine "the Roman" Falcone?

342
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:39,049
Felonies? Nah, guy's a Saint.

343
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,341
- <i>Now.</i>
- Now.

344
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:08,178
You okay, dent?

345
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,547
What is it, heartburn?

346
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,950
Happy to share.

347
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:15,352
Now, Mr. Maroni,

348
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:17,454
may I remind you
that your immunity

349
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:20,858
is contingent upon your truthful
testimony during these proceedings.

350
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:24,128
And I told you the truth.
Falcone is clean as a whistle.

351
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:31,035
Sal, what are you doing?

352
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:32,169
What I'm told.

353
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:36,440
Okay.

354
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:39,443
- Um, your honor, in light of the witness's...
- <i>Double cross!</i>

355
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:43,280
Change of heart,
I need to request a continuance.

356
00:42:43,314 --> 00:42:47,084
Continuance? Uh. What is that?
Like, uh, a holiday?

357
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:48,619
- What?
- <i>Holiday.</i>

358
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,854
You know, like father's day.

359
00:42:53,424 --> 00:42:55,492
Luigi maroni sends his regards.

360
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:56,894
<i>Go.</i>

361
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,535
Bailiff, detain the witness!

362
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:07,338
You're dead, holiday!

363
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:09,039
You hear me, dent?

364
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:11,909
That stuff will
eat through concrete!

365
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,216
- Harvey!
- My god. Call an ambulance!

366
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,176
<i>Idiots. They think it's you.</i>

367
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,879
Who are you?

368
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:52,316
<i>You know who I am.</i>

369
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:56,086
No, I...

370
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,422
<i>You sound tired.</i>

371
00:43:58,455 --> 00:44:00,290
<i>Why not let me take the wheel?</i>

372
00:44:01,392 --> 00:44:05,996
I don't know what's happening.

373
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:08,532
<i>I'm sorry no one told you, harv.</i>

374
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,200
Told me what?

375
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:12,569
You're dead.

376
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,145
I have to take this.

377
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:25,949
Yeah.

378
00:44:27,217 --> 00:44:29,052
Now?

379
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,289
No, it's the perfect time.

380
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:38,395
The doctor says he'll be fine
in a few days. Don't worry.

381
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:42,433
Oh, my god, he's gone.

382
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:45,002
Secure the exits.
He couldn't have gotten far. Let's go!

383
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:10,727
Well, where is...

384
00:45:13,163 --> 00:45:16,133
Let me guess.
You're not coming after all.

385
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,701
<i>Afraid not.</i>

386
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:21,438
Yeah. You're not really
one to get your hands dirty.

387
00:45:21,472 --> 00:45:23,073
<i>You know nothing about me.</i>

388
00:45:23,106 --> 00:45:28,111
I know you're a liar,
a thief, a murderer.

389
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,480
<i>A father.</i>

390
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,686
- A coward.
- <i>Goodbye, dent.</i>

391
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,124
Fine.

392
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:44,161
He wants to talk to you.

393
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:23,700
Come on, come on.

394
00:46:30,474 --> 00:46:32,376
Really?

395
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:48,525
It's not personal.
It's business.

396
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:08,813
Happy birthday, poppa!

397
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,184
All right, here we go.

398
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:22,159
What a wonderful night.
Thank you.

399
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:24,796
This year has been a trying one.

400
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,230
And while we have
yet to fully dismantle

401
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:30,835
the vicious machine
the law has set against us,

402
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:33,637
you might say
we put a dent in it.

403
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:45,282
To Sofia Falcone,
for brokering the peace with maroni.

404
00:47:45,315 --> 00:47:46,350
<i>Mille grazie.</i>

405
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:51,756
And my beautiful sister, Carla.

406
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:53,825
Where is she? Carla?

407
00:47:58,662 --> 00:48:00,397
Probably more TV interviews.

408
00:48:03,868 --> 00:48:06,938
Now, now.
Those interviews helped.

409
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:08,405
I think she's got a future.

410
00:48:35,232 --> 00:48:37,501
Sorry to startle you.

411
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:43,306
Shouldn't you be
looking for Harvey?

412
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,844
I'm narrowing down his location
by interviewing known associates.

413
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:52,182
Known associ... oh...

414
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,552
Well, you're wasting your time.

415
00:48:55,585 --> 00:49:00,257
The man's a mystery.
Or so it would seem.

416
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,894
Did you notice any recent
changes in his behavior?

417
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:05,462
Mood swings?

418
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:07,364
Is that so strange
when you deal with people

419
00:49:07,397 --> 00:49:08,732
like Falcone every day?

420
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:14,204
Harvey never mentioned
he went to Oxford.

421
00:49:18,442 --> 00:49:19,609
Is it important?

422
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:21,812
Maybe.

423
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:26,951
This doesn't feel
like just a job for you.

424
00:49:26,984 --> 00:49:29,286
It's personal. Why?

425
00:49:31,455 --> 00:49:33,958
He's my friend,
and he needs help.

426
00:49:56,646 --> 00:49:58,015
Dinner time already?

427
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:05,555
Solomon grundy

428
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:09,326
born on a Monday.

429
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,597
Christened on a Tuesday,
married on a Wednesday,

430
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:19,302
ill on Thursday,
worse on Friday.

431
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:21,471
Died on Saturday.

432
00:50:21,505 --> 00:50:22,739
Buried on Sunday.

433
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:26,543
That was the end.

434
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,783
Born on a Monday.

435
00:50:39,056 --> 00:50:42,292
Reborn, resurrected.

436
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:45,428
On a Monday.

437
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:49,033
Is that what happened to you?

438
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:50,868
Did you die and come back?

439
00:50:55,438 --> 00:50:58,441
Can a man live two lives?

440
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:02,079
Born on a Monday.

441
00:51:06,784 --> 00:51:09,419
Born on a Monday.

442
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,063
Thirty days hath September.

443
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:23,100
But today's the one
that troubles you the most.

444
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:25,036
Where is he?

445
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:26,503
It's been months.

446
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,108
I've missed you.

447
00:51:31,142 --> 00:51:34,011
The da who was attacked and maimed
before vanishing from the hospital.

448
00:51:34,045 --> 00:51:36,546
Hm, he does that.

449
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,885
Later that night, Carla viti, who'd
publicly accused dent of being holiday,

450
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:43,386
was killed on her way to her
brother's birthday party.

451
00:51:44,454 --> 00:51:47,792
I know. Wasn't that terrible?

452
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:49,894
I think she was right.

453
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:52,462
Of course you do.

454
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:56,566
It seems everyone who comes
after dent winds up dead.

455
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,736
We need to find Harvey
before he kills again.

456
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:02,907
What do you know?

457
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:09,046
Gordon and his men have been here
day after day asking the same thing.

458
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,049
I'll tell you
what I told the captain.

459
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:16,087
Let me walk out of here
and I'll stop the killing.

460
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:19,522
We're done.

461
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:26,197
It's labor day.

462
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:29,733
And, if the pattern holds,

463
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:34,604
I believe you have
something holiday wants.

464
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:39,643
Head north on atwell.

465
00:52:39,676 --> 00:52:42,780
- Sir, the penitentiary is south...
- I know where it is.

466
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,682
This is the longest goddamn
prisoner transfer I've ever seen.

467
00:52:47,885 --> 00:52:49,787
Guess you guys
just can't get enough of me.

468
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:41,504
Dent! You're alive?

469
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:44,574
He's no longer
running this operation.

470
00:53:44,607 --> 00:53:49,046
All right... that's enough.

471
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,050
Relax, Jim, I'm not
here to kill maroni.

472
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:57,721
I'm here to thank him
for giving me a new... outlook.

473
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:02,625
Oh, my god. Harvey...

474
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:08,065
I have to tell you, jimbo,
your gun has come in handy.

475
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:12,837
I know it was meant for Harvey,
but possession is nine-tenths.

476
00:54:15,739 --> 00:54:17,640
If you're not Harvey,
then, who are you?

477
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:20,077
Holiday?

478
00:54:20,111 --> 00:54:21,946
We found the guns
in your basement.

479
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,950
You found the guns
in my basement?

480
00:54:28,252 --> 00:54:29,686
Of course.

481
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:32,857
We know everything.

482
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,234
We just wanna
take you to get help.

483
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:37,594
I think Thomas Wayne
was onto something.

484
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:40,031
You can't beat 'em, jimbo,
not your way.

485
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:42,133
Join 'em first.

486
00:54:43,968 --> 00:54:45,970
Then beat 'em
on their own terms.

487
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:49,572
Heads, you die.

488
00:54:58,816 --> 00:55:01,185
It is up to you, Harvey.

489
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:03,821
You and I know that both sides
of that coin are heads.

490
00:55:04,822 --> 00:55:06,223
How the hell could you...

491
00:55:08,192 --> 00:55:11,929
Oh, nice outfit, bats.

492
00:55:11,962 --> 00:55:14,765
I suppose this little trap
was your idea.

493
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,034
Drop the gun, now!

494
00:55:36,387 --> 00:55:37,620
No!

495
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:49,599
Come on, grundy, move your ass.

496
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,916
I think we're
back to square one.

497
00:56:28,172 --> 00:56:29,773
Ah, you're up early.

498
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:31,741
Hm?

499
00:56:31,775 --> 00:56:34,011
Oh, no, I just got in.

500
00:56:35,446 --> 00:56:38,382
Of course. Then I suppose
it's off to bed with you.

501
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:44,231
- Is there something I can help...
- How did it happen, Alfred?

502
00:56:48,225 --> 00:56:50,761
Were they forced into
business with the falcones?

503
00:56:52,463 --> 00:56:54,731
Or were they so set
on building a legacy

504
00:56:54,765 --> 00:56:56,733
that they'd work
with the devil himself?

505
00:57:02,306 --> 00:57:06,043
Your parents believed that there are
two ways to look at everything...

506
00:57:08,979 --> 00:57:10,381
And everyone.

507
00:57:12,449 --> 00:57:14,051
Only two?

508
00:57:14,084 --> 00:57:16,787
They were young.
Two exceptionally good people

509
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,757
living in
an exceptionally bad place,

510
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:20,891
trying to make it better.

511
00:57:21,892 --> 00:57:23,761
But Falcone?

512
00:57:23,794 --> 00:57:25,372
Didn't they know that
by legitimizing him,

513
00:57:25,396 --> 00:57:27,364
they were helping
to make a monster?

514
00:57:27,398 --> 00:57:29,200
They made difficult choices

515
00:57:29,233 --> 00:57:30,901
and more than a few mistakes.

516
00:57:32,169 --> 00:57:34,104
But they were willing
to pay for them.

517
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,878
I've always told myself that I'm
doing what I do to honor them.

518
00:57:40,911 --> 00:57:45,282
What does it mean if deep down,
I'm really doing it to redeem them?

519
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:50,321
I think it means
your parents would be proud...

520
00:57:52,423 --> 00:57:54,225
Of their real legacy.

521
00:58:04,034 --> 00:58:05,034
This is absurd.

522
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,107
Sorry for the inconvenience,
ma'am, but it's Halloween.

523
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,144
- Mr. Dent is still at large.
- And captain Gordon ordered us to be here.

524
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:15,879
So, you're stuck with us.

525
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:19,383
You've blocked in my car.

526
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:22,419
We're more than happy to drive
you anywhere you need to go.

527
00:58:22,453 --> 00:58:25,489
Though you'll be making our jobs a
lot easier if you remain indoors.

528
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:28,225
There's no way to know where or
when your husband will show up.

529
00:58:29,193 --> 00:58:30,861
My husband is dead.

530
00:58:34,064 --> 00:58:36,500
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but that's not true.

531
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:39,436
Yes, it is.

532
00:58:58,589 --> 00:59:00,057
Wake up, Julian.

533
00:59:01,058 --> 00:59:02,993
You know what today is.

534
00:59:06,597 --> 00:59:09,933
It's all hallows' Eve...

535
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:14,071
The 31st day of the tenth month,

536
00:59:14,104 --> 00:59:19,910
and the 305th
of this miserable leap year.

537
00:59:21,545 --> 00:59:23,080
And...

538
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,585
Taco Tuesday.

539
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,121
<i>Muy bueno.</i>

540
00:59:31,155 --> 00:59:33,357
What the hell?

541
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:58,916
Trick or treat.

542
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,321
Attacking us like that
out in the open...

543
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,558
It didn't fit the profile.

544
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:10,627
So it was a hired gun.

545
01:00:10,661 --> 01:00:14,031
We see dent and holiday in the
same place at the same time,

546
01:00:14,064 --> 01:00:17,034
and, just like that, the da
has got himself an alibi.

547
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,171
Did Harvey study at Oxford?

548
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:23,073
Like Falcone's boy?

549
01:00:23,107 --> 01:00:26,543
I see where you're going but
don't let Harvey hear you say it.

550
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:29,513
He's a Gotham u man.
A dyed-in-the-wool nighthawk.

551
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:32,116
Don't get hung up on it.

552
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:37,054
Not every lead checks out.

553
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:40,457
And we already have
what we need to make our case.

554
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:42,659
It's hard to believe the man
who stood on this roof

555
01:00:42,693 --> 01:00:47,631
and made that promise, that bond with
each of us, would cross the line.

556
01:00:47,664 --> 01:00:52,369
Can you honestly say that man and the
one we met in the alley were the same?

557
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:57,508
There are deep scars there...
And I'm not talking about his face.

558
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:00,411
If you think we're wrong,
find the evidence.

559
01:01:00,444 --> 01:01:03,981
But, for now, the best way
to save lives,

560
01:01:04,014 --> 01:01:06,250
including Harvey's,
is to bring him in.

561
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:33,510
Do you know what my people
call this past year?

562
01:01:35,546 --> 01:01:37,214
The long Halloween.

563
01:01:37,714 --> 01:01:39,116
My nephew,

564
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,686
my son, my sister,

565
01:01:43,654 --> 01:01:45,155
half my men...

566
01:01:47,724 --> 01:01:48,724
Why?

567
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:52,296
Why would dent kill your son?

568
01:01:56,433 --> 01:01:59,503
I wish I had the chance to be
a better father to my boy.

569
01:02:01,038 --> 01:02:02,473
We will never
see each other again.

570
01:02:04,776 --> 01:02:05,776
For that,

571
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:07,643
I am so...

572
01:02:10,314 --> 01:02:11,314
So sorry.

573
01:02:17,454 --> 01:02:20,491
There is a rule among my kind.

574
01:02:20,524 --> 01:02:22,326
We leave the wives out of it,

575
01:02:23,594 --> 01:02:26,764
but dent does not play
by our rules.

576
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:32,169
And when that happens,
he will die.

577
01:02:33,237 --> 01:02:34,271
Whose wives?

578
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:39,376
I guess justice really is blind.

579
01:02:51,221 --> 01:02:52,222
Poppa.

580
01:02:52,256 --> 01:02:53,724
Everything is fine, Sofia.

581
01:02:53,758 --> 01:02:55,392
I just stumbled.

582
01:03:05,302 --> 01:03:07,271
That wasn't necessary.

583
01:03:07,304 --> 01:03:09,373
Maybe not.

584
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:11,742
Are you going to tell me why
you're so obsessed with them?

585
01:03:26,156 --> 01:03:28,458
I never thanked you
for finding me

586
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:30,327
and getting me home that night.

587
01:03:31,595 --> 01:03:33,397
You thought I was your mother.

588
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:34,731
Scarecrow's fear toxin.

589
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:41,204
Where you found me
is where I lost her.

590
01:03:47,244 --> 01:03:49,079
I don't even know
my mother's name.

591
01:03:50,514 --> 01:03:53,584
But I think there's someone
who can tell me.

592
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:00,256
Your father.

593
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:03,426
Are you sure?

594
01:04:04,294 --> 01:04:05,596
When the time comes,

595
01:04:05,629 --> 01:04:08,732
I'm not sure
I'll have it in me to ask.

596
01:04:08,766 --> 01:04:11,401
Is there even such a thing

597
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:12,870
as a normal family in this city?

598
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,772
Maybe not...

599
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:16,774
For people like us.

600
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:32,321
What the hell is that?

601
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:35,692
Oh, shit!

602
01:04:38,662 --> 01:04:41,732
<i>All units,
10-33 at the corner of 6th and Mason.</i>

603
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:43,634
<i>All available units respond.</i>

604
01:04:47,905 --> 01:04:51,174
No, captain said we don't leave
for anything, not tonight.

605
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:27,577
<i>♪ Pop goes the weasel ♪</i>

606
01:05:32,884 --> 01:05:36,954
Keep coming, boys.
Everyone's invited to this party.

607
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:40,624
Not everyone.

608
01:05:48,598 --> 01:05:52,369
Head. I meant heads!

609
01:05:56,406 --> 01:05:57,674
Sofia, please.

610
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,443
It was nothing.

611
01:05:59,476 --> 01:06:00,878
Stop treating me
like an old man.

612
01:06:01,846 --> 01:06:02,846
You're not old.

613
01:06:06,616 --> 01:06:08,652
Maybe I am...

614
01:06:08,685 --> 01:06:10,420
Too old for this business,
at least.

615
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:19,229
Have you...
Heard from your mother?

616
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:21,732
She loves you.

617
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,267
Just not this place.

618
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:26,971
This place is me.

619
01:06:28,873 --> 01:06:30,875
I know you think that

620
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:33,343
and maybe at one time it was.

621
01:06:34,478 --> 01:06:35,679
But things have changed,

622
01:06:36,446 --> 01:06:37,481
so much...

623
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:39,851
So fast.

624
01:06:41,018 --> 01:06:42,385
Haven't I changed with them?

625
01:06:43,788 --> 01:06:45,489
Yes, you have.

626
01:06:45,522 --> 01:06:47,624
But when you were coming up

627
01:06:47,657 --> 01:06:49,726
when mama was here,

628
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:52,629
you wouldn't have thought to hire
freaks like poison Ivy and scarecrow.

629
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:55,867
These... people,

630
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:58,635
they're not stable, poppa.

631
01:07:02,472 --> 01:07:03,473
Times change.

632
01:07:06,476 --> 01:07:07,845
<i>Boss!</i>

633
01:07:07,879 --> 01:07:09,546
<i>Something's wrong downstairs.</i>

634
01:07:09,579 --> 01:07:11,314
<i>The cops took off</i>

635
01:07:11,348 --> 01:07:12,960
<i>and we can't get any
of our guys on the comm.</i>

636
01:07:12,984 --> 01:07:13,984
Maron...

637
01:07:50,121 --> 01:07:51,321
Sofia, no!

638
01:08:07,537 --> 01:08:09,040
Come on, you mother...

639
01:08:29,726 --> 01:08:30,962
Sofia!

640
01:09:13,037 --> 01:09:14,037
What is this?

641
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:21,178
Judgment day.

642
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:29,987
We lost them in the sewers.

643
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:33,057
You're right.
This was meant to distract us.

644
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:36,027
Yeah, but distract us from what?

645
01:09:41,032 --> 01:09:44,201
I really
owe it all to you, carmine.

646
01:09:44,235 --> 01:09:47,772
You've taught me
that all men are guilty...

647
01:09:49,639 --> 01:09:52,509
And innocent.

648
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:54,711
Which makes justice nothing more

649
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:56,047
than the flip of a coin.

650
01:09:57,782 --> 01:09:59,083
The outcome unpredictable.

651
01:10:00,017 --> 01:10:02,552
That is, of course...

652
01:10:02,585 --> 01:10:08,125
Unless the system is corrupted,
rigged in a man's favor.

653
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:12,629
Legit businessman/philanthropist
by day.

654
01:10:12,662 --> 01:10:17,034
Criminal racketeer,
murderer by night.

655
01:10:17,068 --> 01:10:19,904
You've rigged every game
you've ever played

656
01:10:19,937 --> 01:10:22,773
in your business
and your family.

657
01:10:24,674 --> 01:10:27,812
It's really the most minor
of adjustments,

658
01:10:27,845 --> 01:10:31,548
a small change of outlook
that decides if you live...

659
01:10:32,582 --> 01:10:33,650
Or not.

660
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:44,061
Just pull the fucking trigger.

661
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:47,664
You haven't listened.

662
01:10:47,697 --> 01:10:50,201
If you had, you'd understand

663
01:10:50,234 --> 01:10:52,535
that for the first time,
carmine,

664
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:54,038
it really isn't up to me.

665
01:10:54,872 --> 01:10:56,007
Good luck.

666
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:05,782
No!

667
01:12:03,874 --> 01:12:06,743
<i>En garde,</i>
you sanctimonious shit...

668
01:12:06,777 --> 01:12:07,845
Ow!

669
01:12:23,294 --> 01:12:26,997
Nancy, hold all my calls.

670
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:29,834
I have to terminate someone.

671
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,420
Harvey, don't!

672
01:13:16,113 --> 01:13:18,648
Alone at last.

673
01:13:20,184 --> 01:13:22,219
Now let's get you
out of all this.

674
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:39,069
Stay back.

675
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:51,182
Harvey.

676
01:13:51,215 --> 01:13:52,816
You don't have to do this.

677
01:13:53,884 --> 01:13:56,820
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey.

678
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:59,456
Can't you see
I'm a new man, bats?

679
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:01,025
I'm finally awake.

680
01:14:02,293 --> 01:14:03,961
And, unlike Harvey dent,

681
01:14:03,994 --> 01:14:07,431
I'm not beholden
to petty motives like revenge,

682
01:14:07,464 --> 01:14:10,901
or, worse, career advancement.

683
01:14:11,902 --> 01:14:13,904
A weight has been lifted.

684
01:14:13,938 --> 01:14:16,307
I don't have to decide
who's innocent

685
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,409
and who's guilty anymore.

686
01:14:18,442 --> 01:14:20,044
All I have to do

687
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:23,147
is... execute.

688
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:29,353
- Guilty.
- No!

689
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:30,854
No!

690
01:14:43,801 --> 01:14:44,835
Poppa.

691
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,370
Sofia, no!

692
01:14:55,379 --> 01:14:56,447
Two bullets only.

693
01:14:57,214 --> 01:14:59,350
Sorry, gorgeous.

694
01:14:59,383 --> 01:15:03,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

695
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,834
Sofia.

696
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:23,073
I can't... I can't hold on.

697
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:03,280
Louisa?

698
01:16:04,515 --> 01:16:05,515
Louisa.

699
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:13,524
Selina.

700
01:16:16,593 --> 01:16:19,830
- Selina?
- Let me help you.

701
01:16:21,365 --> 01:16:22,399
No.

702
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:24,101
No.

703
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:28,572
All we get is all we take.

704
01:16:30,074 --> 01:16:31,475
Do you still believe?

705
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:34,111
Yes...

706
01:16:34,144 --> 01:16:35,512
I do.

707
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:38,514
Good.

708
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:10,981
Harvey?

709
01:17:11,014 --> 01:17:12,014
Not anymore.

710
01:17:16,453 --> 01:17:17,921
It had to be done.

711
01:17:19,523 --> 01:17:21,091
You will never
convince me of that.

712
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:24,928
There won't be
any judges to be bribed.

713
01:17:26,029 --> 01:17:27,598
No witnesses to disappear.

714
01:17:29,099 --> 01:17:32,169
The Roman is dead
and two-face killed him.

715
01:17:34,338 --> 01:17:36,173
The long Halloween...

716
01:17:37,307 --> 01:17:38,308
Is over.

717
01:17:41,645 --> 01:17:42,646
We'll get you help.

718
01:17:45,516 --> 01:17:49,353
You're the ones who're gonna
need help from now on.

719
01:17:51,355 --> 01:17:52,990
Harvey...

720
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:56,393
Two-face... whatever.

721
01:17:56,427 --> 01:17:58,429
You betrayed everything
you believe in.

722
01:18:00,297 --> 01:18:01,432
Not everything.

723
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:08,405
Arrest me, jimbo.

724
01:18:10,307 --> 01:18:12,409
I'm responsible.

725
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:16,280
Not just for Falcone,
but all the holiday killings.

726
01:18:18,449 --> 01:18:20,517
I have to face judgment.

727
01:18:31,796 --> 01:18:32,796
The cost.

728
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:38,502
The promise we made
right here, one year ago

729
01:18:38,535 --> 01:18:43,974
to take down the Roman.
In the end... was it worth it?

730
01:18:45,777 --> 01:18:48,445
He's asking
if the good guys won.

731
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:51,448
Yes, the good guys won.

732
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:53,317
But we won't know
for a very long time

733
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:54,351
if it was worth it.

734
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:29,686
Gilda.

735
01:19:48,472 --> 01:19:49,472
It had to be done.

736
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,142
You know that.

737
01:19:52,175 --> 01:19:55,612
The same way you knew Harvey
never went to Oxford.

738
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,680
That was me.

739
01:19:58,850 --> 01:19:59,850
Well,

740
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:01,752
me and...

741
01:20:03,353 --> 01:20:05,088
Alberto Falcone.

742
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:09,059
If you could see
how in love we were then.

743
01:20:11,161 --> 01:20:12,663
I was pregnant.

744
01:20:12,696 --> 01:20:14,565
He didn't hesitate.

745
01:20:14,598 --> 01:20:16,133
We were married that same day.

746
01:20:18,235 --> 01:20:21,338
He was heir to the Roman empire.

747
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:24,107
And his father could never
welcome into the family

748
01:20:24,141 --> 01:20:26,310
a child
conceived out of wedlock.

749
01:20:28,145 --> 01:20:29,680
I tried to fight.

750
01:20:29,713 --> 01:20:31,381
But what chance
did I have opposite

751
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:32,482
the godfather of Gotham?

752
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:38,589
Against my will,

753
01:20:38,622 --> 01:20:40,758
our marriage was annulled
and our child

754
01:20:41,692 --> 01:20:43,293
ripped from my womb.

755
01:20:45,763 --> 01:20:46,764
What they did to me...

756
01:20:48,498 --> 01:20:49,733
The way it was done...

757
01:20:51,635 --> 01:20:52,770
Left me broken.

758
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:55,873
You wanted revenge.

759
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:00,878
I wanted justice.

760
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:03,180
I came to Gotham and married
the man I thought

761
01:21:03,213 --> 01:21:06,383
had the best chance
of delivering it.

762
01:21:06,416 --> 01:21:10,454
Oh... Harvey and I
were so much alike,

763
01:21:10,487 --> 01:21:14,157
only what was inside him
hadn't yet been ripped out.

764
01:21:15,692 --> 01:21:18,395
That was... useful.

765
01:21:20,932 --> 01:21:22,199
And...

766
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:26,804
Even fun for a time.

767
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:29,907
But then he became so busy
wrestling his own demon,

768
01:21:29,941 --> 01:21:34,211
I was left to take down mine
all by myself.

769
01:21:36,613 --> 01:21:41,886
One holiday, one twisted family
snapshot at a time.

770
01:21:45,823 --> 01:21:48,659
I have no regrets about
what I did to the Roman,

771
01:21:48,692 --> 01:21:50,795
or his son,

772
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:53,463
or anyone else in that
godforsaken family.

773
01:21:56,266 --> 01:21:57,769
But Harvey,

774
01:21:57,802 --> 01:22:00,170
in the end, I loved him.

775
01:22:03,707 --> 01:22:05,208
But not all of him.

776
01:22:07,411 --> 01:22:08,813
So...

777
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:11,581
Are you going to
take me away or just...

778
01:22:11,615 --> 01:22:12,784
Stand there in judgment?

779
01:22:15,252 --> 01:22:17,889
I need to know
that holiday is done.

780
01:22:19,957 --> 01:22:21,324
Not done...

781
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:23,560
Finished.

782
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:34,571
I wonder... how long
did he know about me?

783
01:22:36,473 --> 01:22:37,713
Is that how you figured it out?

784
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:39,977
Did Harvey tip you off?

785
01:22:42,512 --> 01:22:43,580
He didn't give you up.

786
01:22:44,648 --> 01:22:45,649
Not knowingly.

787
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:49,386
But after maroni was killed,

788
01:22:49,419 --> 01:22:53,490
the way he protected holiday,
he must have known then.

789
01:22:54,424 --> 01:22:55,492
He was my friend.

790
01:22:56,526 --> 01:22:57,526
He believed in me.

791
01:22:58,428 --> 01:22:59,428
I should have saved him.

792
01:23:01,032 --> 01:23:02,399
What will you do now?

793
01:23:04,035 --> 01:23:05,335
Tell Gordon?

794
01:23:26,057 --> 01:23:27,424
Alfred.

795
01:23:27,457 --> 01:23:29,426
Really?

796
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:31,963
I know it's late, sir,
but you never know.

797
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:34,999
It doesn't matter
how late it is.

798
01:23:35,032 --> 01:23:37,534
We don't get trick-or-treaters.

799
01:23:37,567 --> 01:23:40,437
Not all Gotham families
share your obstinate hope.

800
01:23:41,839 --> 01:23:43,740
It's going to take
a lot more good people

801
01:23:43,775 --> 01:23:47,410
trying to make things better
before we see real change.

802
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,349
If you say so, sir.

803
01:23:56,854 --> 01:23:58,054
You're cute when you're wrong.

804
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:01,690
Trick or treat.

805
01:26:54,664 --> 01:26:56,000
It's for you, sir.
