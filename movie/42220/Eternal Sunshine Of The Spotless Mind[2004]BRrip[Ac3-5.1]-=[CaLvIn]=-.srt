<i>Random thoughts
for valentine's Day 2004.</i>

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,770
<i>Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...</i>

4
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,770
<i>Last call--</i>

5
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,320
<i>to make people
feel like crap.</i>

6
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,990
<i>I ditched work today.</i>

7
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,450
<i>Took a train out to Montauk.</i>

8

<i>Montauk train boarding

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,870
<i>I don't know why.</i>

10
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,120
<i>I'm not an impulsive person.</i>

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,510
<i>I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.</i>

12
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,890
<i>I gotta get my car fixed.</i>

13
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,890
Hi. Cindy?

14
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,390
It's Joel. Joel!

15
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,440
Listen I don't
feel very well today.

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,440
No food poisoning
I think.

17
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,030
<i>It's goddamn freezing on this beach.</i>

18
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,650
<i>Montauk in February..
Brilliant Joel.</i>

19
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,370
<i>Page is ripped out.</i>

20
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,950
<i>Don't remember doing that.</i>

<i>It appears this is
my first entry. in two years.</i>

22
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,890
<i>Sand is overrated.</i>

23
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
<i>It's just tiny little rocks.</i>

24
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,400
<i>If only I could
meet someone new.</i>

25
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,320
<i>I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished</i>

26
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,990
<i>seeing that I'm incapable
of making eye contact
with a woman I don't know.</i>

27
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,290
<i>Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi.</i>

28
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,040
<i>She was nice.
Nice is good.</i>

29
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,630
<i>She loved me.</i>

30
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,750
<i>Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see...</i>

31
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,670
<i>who shows me
the least bit of attention?</i>

32
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
Hi.

33
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,660
I'm sorry?

34
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,470
- I just said hi.
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

35
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,220
Okay if I sit closer?

36
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,310
How far are you going?

37
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,650
Uh Rockville Center.

38
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,020
Get out! Me too!

39
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,030
Really?
What are the odds?

40
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Do I know you?

41
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,990
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

42
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,200
Sure. Sure.
That's it!

43
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,620
Yeah?
I've seen you man!

44
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,880
Book slave there
for like five years now.

45
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,300
Ah. I would have thought
I would've remembered you.
Jesus! Is it five years?

46
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,470
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,680
What might?
It changes a lot.

48
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,060
The color.
That's why you might not
recognize me.

49
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,770
It's called Blue Ruin
the color.
Right. Yeah.

50
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,190
Snappy name huh?
I like it.

51
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,650
Yeah.

52
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,820
Anyway this company
makes a whole line of colors
with equally snappy names.

53
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,360
Red-- Red Menace
Yellow Fever
Green Revolution.

54
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,370
That'd be a job
coming up with those names.

55
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,370
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

56
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,960
I mean how many hair colors
could there be? Fifty maybe.

57
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,080
Someone's got that job.

58
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,170
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.

59
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,130
I apply my personality
in a paste.

60
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,140
Oh I doubt that very much.

61
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,720
Well you don't know me
so...

62
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,930
you don't know do you?

63
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,150
Sorry. I was just--
I'm trying to be nice.

64
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,980
Yeah. I got it.

65
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,510
My name's Clementine
by the way.
I'm Joel.

66
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,880
Hi Joel.
Hey.

67
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,510
No jokes about my name.

68
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,890
Oh no you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.

69
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,850
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

70
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,110
Huckleberry Hound.

71
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,730
I don't know what that means.

72
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,940
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you nuts?

73
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,950
It's been suggested.

74
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,120
<i>Oh my darlin' oh my darlin'
Oh my darlin' Clementine</i>

75
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,290
<i>You were lost
and gone forever</i>

76
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,870
<i>Dreadful sorry
Clementine</i>

77
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,910
No?

78
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm sorry. Just--
It's a pretty name though.
It really is nice.

79
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
It's uh--
It means "merciful."

80
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,960
Right? Clemency?

81
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,260
Although it hardly fits.

82
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,590
I'm a vindictive little bitch
truth be told.

83
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,140
Gee I-I wouldn't
think that about you.

84
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,390
Why wouldn't you
think that about me?
I don't know.

85
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,690
I just--

86
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,100
I don't know.
I just uh--

87
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,110
You seem nice so--

88
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,190
Oh now I'm nice?

89
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,450
Oh God. Don't you know
any other adjectives?

90
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,450
I don't need "nice."

91
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,490
I don't need myself to be it
and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.

92
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,330
Joel?

93
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,670
It's Joel right?

94
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,170
Yes.

95
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,670
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

96
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,260
I'm a little out of sorts today.

97
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,850
My embarrassing admission is

98
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,860
I really like
that you're nice right now.

99
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,740
I mean I can't tell
from one moment to the next
what I'm gonna like

100
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
but right now...

101
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,950
I'm glad you are.

102
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,340
I have so much stuff
that uh I probably should uh--

103
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,510
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
I-I'm writing and--

104
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,680
No no. I just--
Sure. No. That's okay.

105
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,350
I just have--
You know this is--
Okay.

106
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,810
- Ohh! Hey!
- Take care then.

107
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,890
Jesus!

108
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,120
Hi. I could uh
give you a ride if you need.

109
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
It's cold.

110
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,120
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah?

111
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,080
It is frosty.

112
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,960
You're not a stalker
or anything right?
I'm not a stalker.

113
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,130
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?

114
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,460
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

115
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,630
Really?
There's a stalker book?

116
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,930
Okay.

117
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,300
I gotta read that one.

118
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,810
Look I'm sorry if I came off
sorta nutso. I'm not really.

119
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,320
Oh it's okay.
I didn't think you were.

120
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,990
Did you wanna have a drink?

121
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,290
I have lots of drinks
and I could um--

122
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,290
Um--

123
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,290
Never mind.

124
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,710
Sorry. That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No no no no.

125
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,790
Good nightJoel.

126
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
Two Blue Ruins.

127
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,190
Thank you.

128
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,200
Drink up young man.

129
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,070
It'll make
the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

130
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,290
I'm just kidding!

131
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,370
Come on.

132
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
You're kinda closed-mouthed
aren't you?

133
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,300
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,890
It's just you know
my life isn't that interesting.

135
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,560
I go to work I come home.

136
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,140
Don't know what to say.

137
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,150
You should read my journal.

138
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,690
I mean it's just... blank.

139
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,990
Really?
Does that make you
sad or anxious?

140
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,410
I mean I'm always anxious
thinking I'm not living
my life to the fullest

141
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,410
taking advantage
of every possibility

142
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,410
making sure
I'm not wasting one second
of the little time I have.

143
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,960
I think about that.
Yeah?

144
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,340
You're really nice.

145
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,260
God I have to
stop saying that.

146
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,470
I'm gonna marry you.

147
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,470
I know it.

148
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,680
Um... okay.

149
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,360
Joel you should come up
to the Charles with me sometime.

150
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,400
It gets frozen this time of year.

151
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,570
That sounds scary.
Exactly.

152
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,580
I'll pack a picnic.

153
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,580
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.

154
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,540
And um we could--

155
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,540
Sounds good.

156
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,170
But I-- I should uh go.
Now.

157
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,170
You should stay.

158
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,470
No I really-- I'm-- I--

159
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,470
I have to get up so early.

160
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,470
I would like you
to call me.

161
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,310
Would you do that?
I would like it.

162
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,390
Yes.

163
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,650
Wish me a happy valentine's Day
when you call!

164
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,610
That'd be nice.

165
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,320
<i>What took you so long?</i>

166
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,320
I just walked in.

167
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,990
<i>You miss me?</i>

168
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,280
Yeah.
Oddly enough I do.

169
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,290
<i>You said "I do."
I guess that means were married.</i>

170
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,290
I guess so.

171
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,830
<i>Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?</i>

172
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,340
It's really solid
this time of year.

173
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,260
I don't know.

174
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,260
Come on.
Come on.

175
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,260
Come on.
Come on come on.

176
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,350
Oh. So beautiful.

177
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,520
Isn't it?

178
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,520
Uh don't go too far.

179
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,610
- Are you okay?
- Ouch! Fuck it.

180
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,410
Oh my ass!

181
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,410
I think I should go back.
Come on. Come on!

182
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,420
What if it breaks?

183
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,420
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?

184
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,630
Come here. Please.

185
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,470
Come on.

186
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,770
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.

187
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,100
This is good.
Here let me show you
this one thing.

188
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,270
What are you doing?

189
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,650
Come on.

190
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,570
Think I heard a crack.

191
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,410
It's not gonna crack
or break or--

192
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,450
It's so thick.

193
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,750
Show me which constellations
you know.

194
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,170
I don't... know any.

195
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,840
Show me
which ones you know.

196
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,350
Okay.

197
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,010
Okay.

198
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,520
Oh. Here's Osidius.

199
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,560
Where?

200
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,560
Right there.
See?

201
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,400
Sort of a swoop
and a cross.

202
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,400
Osidius the Emphatic.

203
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,870
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.

204
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,870
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.

205
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,000
Shut the fuck up!

206
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,090
Clementine.

207
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,390
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

208
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,930
Hey.
Hey.

209
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,060
Hey.
Sorry to wake you
but we're... here.

210
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,160
Can I come over
to your house...

211
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,910
to sleep?

212
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,830
I'm so tired.

213
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,710
Okay. Um yeah. Sure.

214
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,670
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah.

215
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,010
Just--

216
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Yes?

217
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,030
Can I help you?
What do you mean?

218
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,570
Can I help you with something?

219
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,240
No.

220
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,620
What are you doing here?

221
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,210
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

222
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Thanks.

223
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,480
I need your lovin'

224
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,610
Like the sunshine

225
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,240
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

226
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,790
Every.body's gotta learn sometime

227
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,970
Every.body's gotta learn sometime

228
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,110
We're looking for 159.
What number's that?

229
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,120
I don't know where that is.

230
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,120
Jesus Christ you'd think
they'd light the number
or at least put a number on--

231
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
Is that him?
I think so.

232
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,290
Yeah that's him.
Wait. That's him.

233
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Hey Joel.
Frank.

234
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,480
Oh shit.

235
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,980
Jesus. The only
valentine's Day cards I get
are from my mother.

236
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,990
How pathetic is that huh?

237
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,990
You're lucky
you have Clementine man.

238
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,990
She is way cool.

239
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,580
Hey you got any big
valentine's Day plans with her?

240
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,580
No.

241
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,580
Well it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations
or something.

242
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,790
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's. Right?

243
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,800
McRomance!

244
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,300
You want some fries
with that shake?

245
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,680
I have to uh
go to sleep now Frank.

246
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,930
It's 8:30.

247
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,500
Patrick stop it.

248
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,770
Okay.

249
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,270
Okay. Okay.

250
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,730
Okay.

251
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,780
Showtime at the Apollo.

252
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,880
Quiet.

253
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,850
Hey Joel. What's up?

254
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,850
Oh. Hi Frank.

255
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,200
I only get valentine's Day cards
from my mom.

256
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,200
How pathetic is that?

257
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,200
You're lucky
you have Clementine Joel.

258
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,200
Hey you got uh any uh big
valentine's Day plans with her?

259
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,210
No.

260
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,210
It's only a day away.

261
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,710
Better make a reservation
or something.

262
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,710
Don't wanna end up
at Mickey D's.

263
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,300
Oh no!

264
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,640
Yes! valentine's Day
is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.

265
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,850
I'm willing to be
the one to resolve it.

266
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,230
So I call her
and she's changed her number.

267
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,400
So I walked over to Antic Attic
you know to get her something.

268
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,440
I thought I'd go over to work
give her an early valentine and--

269
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,070
You won't believe it.

270
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,910
She's there with...

271
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,660
this guy
this really young guy.

272
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,210
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

273
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,710
Excuse me?

274
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,420
Can I help you
find something sir?

275
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,300
Hey Clem-ato.

276
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,430
Patrick! Baby boy.

277
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,720
What you doing here baby?
Just came to surprise you.

278
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,690
Let me know
if you need something sir.
You look good.

279
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,690
- Hi.

280
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,860
How are you?
Pretty good.
Pretty bored. Pretty tired.

281
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,070
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh good.

282
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,630
Why?

283
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,170
Why would she do that to me?

284
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,590
Hey does anybody want a joint?

285
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,260
Oh God Rob give it a rest.

286
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,260
Oh God.
She's punishing me.

287
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,270
I know honey.
For being honest.

288
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,600
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.

289
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,600
No! No no no.
You don't wanna go there man.
You don't wanna go there.

290
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,070
Get off. It's too--

291
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,070
Right.
Yeah.

292
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,070
I don't want to seem desperate.

293
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,700
Joel why don't you just see this as a sign
make a clean break. Right?

294
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,910
Right?

295
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,080
All rightJoel
look man seriously.

296
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,080
Rob!
Here's the deal.

297
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,300
Don't do that.
Rob what are you doing?
No no no no.

298
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,550
What's your fucking suggestion Carrie?
What's your brilliant reasoned solution?

299
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,130
You're gonna make this
about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

300
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,260
I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel who's an adult.
Okay?

301
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,350
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

302
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,600
- What are you--
- That's your laundry!

303
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,570
That's great.
That's good.

304
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,580
Okay.

305
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,800
What is it?
I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.

306
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,690
Good morning. Lacuna.

307
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,690
No I'm sorry..
That offer expired
after the new year.

308
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,610
Yeah sure.
We can fit you in--

309
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,990
How about on the fifth?

310
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,450
That's a Wednesday.
All right great.
Could you spell that please?

311
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,040
Okay and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

312
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,710
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

313
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,750
May I help you?

314
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?

315
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,390
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr.--

316
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,390
Mierzwiak.

317
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,720
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

318
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,810
You still need to
fill the form out sir.
Really?

319
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,980
- Thank you.
- Great.

320
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,980
I don't have a pen.

321
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,150
There's a pen right there.

322
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,150
Good morning. Lacuna.

323
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Ohyeah that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.

324
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Mr. Barish?

325
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,460
How are we today?

326
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,460
Not too good actually.

327
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,460
Noo!
Oh my God! Stan!

328
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,460
Sorry.
Sorry I was just--
I'm working!

329
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,840
Sorry. Sorry.

330
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,930
Here Doctor.
Thank you.

331
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,850
You should not
have seen this.

332
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,930
I apologize.

333
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,230
This is a hoax right?
I mean this is Clem--

334
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,150
I assure you no.
No.

335
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,320
There's no such thing as this.

336
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,000
Look our files are confidential
Mr. Barish

337
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,540
so I can't show you evidence.

338
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:11,340
Suffice it to say that Miss uh--
Miss Kruczynski was not happy

339
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,510
and she wanted to move on.

340
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,510
We provide that possibility.

341
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,640
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.

342
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,220
<i>We provide
that possibility."</i>

343
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,230
What the hell is that?

344
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,230
Nicest guy
she ever went out with.

345
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,230
Fuck!

346
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,730
God Rob! Give it a rest!

347
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,730
It's okay.
It's all right.

348
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,530
Carrie I am making
a birdhouse.

349
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,280
What can I sayJoel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.

350
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,160
She's impulsive.

351
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,790
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

352
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,630
A lark.

353
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,130
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

354
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,470
Wait wait wait wait!

355
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,470
I'm sorry Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

356
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-valentine's Day
is our busy time.

357
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,980
- Oh th-th-that's-- that's okay Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

358
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,980
Mr. Barish if you'd like to uh--
to come inside.

359
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,610
And Mary if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye Mrs. Woo.
Yes of course.

360
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,370
Now the uh--

361
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,370
the first thing
we need you to do Mr. Barish

362
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,370
is to go home...

363
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,880
and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.

364
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,170
Anything.

365
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,890
And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.

366
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,560
Okay?

367
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,690
So we'll need uh
uh photos clothing gifts

368
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,730
books she may have bought you
CDs you may have bought together

369
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,450
Journal entries.

370
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,280
We want to empty your home--

371
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,660
We want to empty your life
of Clementine.

372
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,210
And after the mapping is done
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

373
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,670
That way when you awake
in the morning

374
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,170
you'll find yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened--

375
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,720
a new life awaiting you.

376
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,220
Wake up buddy!

377
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,190
No I'm sorry Mrs. Sobel.

378
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,400
You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.

379
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,070
Well it's just not our policy--
How are you today Mr. Barish?

380
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,830
Hello. I'm right here.

381
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,120
I know it's an emergency
and we'll do everything we can--
We can fit you in on the first of March.

382
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,620
Maybe you could talk to the doctor
a-and he--

383
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,960
All right so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like
to come in this week?

384
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,470
Mr. Barish.
Um he's really busy
this afternoon.

385
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,470
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?

386
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,430
February is very busy for us
because of valentine's Day.

387
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,650
This is uh Stan Fink

388
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,320
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

389
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,870
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

390
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,370
Great to meet you
Mr. Barish.

391
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,370
My name is Joel Barish

392
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:35,000
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

393
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,130
very good.
Now tell me about uh Clementine.

394
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,720
Uh I was...

395
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,590
living with this woman Naomi

396
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,220
uh a couple years ago

397
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:54,560
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach--
I don't like parties.

398
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,860
Naomi couldn't go but I went...

399
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,070
and I uh met Clementine.

400
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,150
I'm sorry.

401
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,160
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

402
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,830
and work backwards from there
more or less.

403
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,830
There's an emotional core...

404
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,830
to each of our memories

405
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,670
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

406
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,170
By the time you wake up
in the morning

407
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,970
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared

408
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,090
as in a dream upon waking.

409
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,430
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

410
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,520
Well uh technically speaking

411
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,520
the procedure is brain damage

412
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,440
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

413
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,440
Nothing you'll miss.

414
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,900
Comfortable?

415
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,610
What we're doing here Mr. Barish
is actually creating a map of your brain.

416
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,990
Okay let's get started.

417
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,830
If we want to get
this procedure under way tonight
we have some work to do.

418
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,710
I want you to react
to these objects Mr. Barish
if you will.

419
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,840
There's a good story
behind this one--

420
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,840
Uh actually Mr. Barish
I'll get a much better
emotional readout...

421
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,800
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

422
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,810
Just try to focus on the memories.

423
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,430
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

424
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,650
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. very. good.

425
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,980
- Here's another object.
That's so--

426
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,650
Next item. Okay.

427
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,160
Potato head.

428
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,490
- Next item. Okay.

429
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,420
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick do me a favor.

430
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,840
Hey Patrick
do me a favor will ya?
Yeah.

431
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,760
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?

432
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,760
Uh voltage looks fine.
Really?

433
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,850
Well I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.
I'm--

434
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,900
<i>Well uh technically the procedure
is brain damage.</i>

435
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,440
Check the uh--
Check the connections please.

436
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,900
Oh there you are.
I --

437
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,330
Why am I --
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

438
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,210
Why am I
standing here and--

439
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,130
Oh my God.
Déjà-vu.

440
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,300
Déjà-vu.
This is so--

441
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,300
All right we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...

442
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,300
underway tonight
we have some work to do.

443
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,890
I'm in my head already
aren't I?

444
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,310
I suppose so.
Uh this is about right.

445
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,350
This is what it--
This is what it would look like.

446
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,860
very good.

447
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,190
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

448
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,610
That way you won't be confused later
by their unexplainable presence in your home.

449
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,950
Ah there we go.

450
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,450
Patrick?
Yeah?

451
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,160
Patrick can you check--
Patrick?

452
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,710
I'm getting some sort of readout
of my own voice.
Patrick? Patrick?

453
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,710
- Why are there so many wires?
<i>- A lot of equipment.</i>

454
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,550
- Does that help?
<i>- Are you sure
you set that thing up properly?</i>

455
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,550
<i>How's that?</i>
How are you today
Mr. Barish?

456
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,720
There we are
Mr. Barish.
<i>All right that's better.</i>

457
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,140
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this then.

458
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,100
We're almost done now.

459
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,310
Journal.
That would be invaluable.

460
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:27,480
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.

461
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,110
Her name is Clementine
and she's amazing."<i></i>

462
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,740
- Whoa! Jesus!

463
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,740
What? What?
Come on! Careful!
Step back!

464
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,740
Just take it easy.

465
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,620
That's fine.

466
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,540
Let's not roach the guy.

467
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,080
All right you got that one.

468
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,960
This place is sort of a dump
don't you think?
It's an apartment Patrick.

469
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,300
Patrick.

470
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,430
Well not a dump then
but sorta plain. Uninspired.

471
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,970
And there's sort of
a stale smell.

472
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,600
Patrick can we just please
get through this?

473
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,270
We got a very long night
ahead of us. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah.

474
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,780
<i>This is the last time I saw you.</i>

475
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,920
It's 3:00.

476
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,590
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.

477
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,600
Were you driving drunk?

478
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,930
It's pathetic.

479
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,230
I was a little tipsy.

480
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,230
Don't call me pathetic.

481
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,230
Well it is pathetic.

482
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,230
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh God.

483
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,240
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh Christ!

484
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,610
Should I check the grill to see
if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!

485
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,580
It's just a fucking dent Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.

486
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,080
Well what are you like?

487
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,080
A wino?
A wino?

488
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,080
Jesus are you from the '50s
or something?

489
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,090
A wino?

490
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,420
Face it Joely.

491
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,930
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you

492
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,930
and in your little wormy brain...

493
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,970
you're trying to figure out
did she fuck someone tonight?

494
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,520
No see Clem

495
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,190
I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

496
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,690
Isn't that how you get people
to like you?

497
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,950
I'm sorry.. Okay?

498
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,830
Clem I didn't mean it.
All right?

499
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,300
Clem?
Your keys.

500
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,300
I was just-- I was just--
I won't need them anymore.

501
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,470
Angry or annoyed or something
I don't know.

502
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,150
Clem?

503
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,150
Got it.

504
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,150
Mary's coming over tonight.

505
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,860
Yeah?
Yeah.

506
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,870
Just thought you'd wanna know.

507
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,950
I like Mary.. I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.

508
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,540
She likes you okay.

509
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,750
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.

510
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,340
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have--

511
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,380
Yeah.

512
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,760
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

513
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,760
We gotta focus here
Patrick.

514
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,770
Yeah the thing is

515
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,770
our situation is--
is a little weird.

516
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,810
My girlfriend situation.

517
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,690
I'm sure it is.

518
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,730
You gotta be--

519
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,760
Clem let me drive you home.

520
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,930
Get out of my face faggot!

521
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,890
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

522
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,310
I'm erasing you and I'm happy!

523
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,360
You did it to me first!

524
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,400
I can't believe
you did this to me.
Goddamn it.

525
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,410
Clem! Can you hear me?

526
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,070
By morning you'll be gone!

527
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,620
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

528
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:59,460
<i>Is there something wrong
with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?</i>

529
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,050
<i>No I think it's... funny.</i>

530
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,220
<i>So who do you think's better-looking
me or this guy?</i>

531
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,220
<i>Patrick let's focus buddy.</i>

532
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,890
<i>Remember that girl
we did last week?</i>

533
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,100
<i>The one with the... potatoes?</i>

534
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,230
<i>That girl?
That's this guy's girl.</i>

535
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,230
</i>Right.
Yeah.<i>

536
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,240
<i>Was. We took care of that.</i>

537
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,820
<i>Oh God!
Well uh...</i>

538
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,740
I kinda fell in love with her
that night.

539
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,740
What? You little fuck--

540
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,830
What?
She was unconscious man.

541
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,920
Well she was beautiful and...

542
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I stole a pair of her panties
as well.

543
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,840
Jesus!
What?

544
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,840
It's not like--

545
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,890
I mean they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

546
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,430
<i>They were clean!
What? D-Don't!Stop!</i>

547
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,940
<i>Okay. Yeah! All right!
We got work to do.</i>

548
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
<i>Give me my papers.</i>

549
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,870
There's um--

550
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,250
There's more.

551
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,340
After we did her I kind of...

552
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,840
went to where she works
and asked her out.

553
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,220
<i>You what?</i>

554
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,930
Jesus.
Jesus Patrick!

555
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,970
Do you have... any idea...

556
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,850
how unethical--

557
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,850
It's not really that bad.

558
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,690
What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

559
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,030
<i>Patrick you stole a girl's panties!</i>

560
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,370
There's someone here.

561
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,330
He stole your underwear.

562
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,550
I don't see anyone.

563
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,110
Joel?

564
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,610
Where are my boots?

565
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,110
<i>Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?</i>

566
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,200
<i>"Potions" I said.
Potions.</i>

567
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,580
<i>Love potion please.</i>

568
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,540
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

569
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,180
Should've left you
at the flea market.

570
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,510
First thing to do is--

571
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,560
sift in a cup
of powdered whale heart.

572
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,980
Wanna go?

573
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,280
I want to have a baby.

574
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,240
Let's talk about it later.

575
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,490
No! I want to have a baby.

576
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,540
I don't think we're ready.

577
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,660
You're not ready.

578
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,960
Clem do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

579
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,170
What?

580
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,130
I don't wanna
talk about it here.

581
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,970
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

582
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,470
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!

583
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,970
We're fucking
gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to--

584
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,640
You can't just say something like that
and say you don't wanna talk about it!

585
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,650
I'm sorry Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!

586
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,150
I love children I'm creative and smart
and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh God--

587
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,570
It's you Joel. It's you
who can't commit to anything!

588
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,370
It's going! It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are
I'm interested in you!

589
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,370
Maybe I should end this
right hereJoel!

590
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,790
Leave you at the flea market
with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done. This is crap.

591
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,380
Maybe you could find yourself
an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain confusion--

592
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,970
Oh. Hi Patrick.
Hi Mary. How's it goin'?

593
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,970
Hey you.
Oh it's freezing outside.

594
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,890
Find us okay?
Yeah.

595
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,770
Hot!

596
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,900
Poor guy.

597
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,990
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

598
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,990
Uh we haven't really
checked yet.

599
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,990
Patrick?
Uh yeah.

600
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,500
Uh let me do the honors.

601
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,710
Mary hates me.

602
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,460
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

603
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,460
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

604
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,550
Stan. Stan.

605
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,050
There's more.
No!

606
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,430
Yes.
No!

607
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,390
Hey hey!

608
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,390
Oh you didn't want any
did you Patrick?

609
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,060
Uh no that's okay.
Wait.

610
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,440
"Blessed are the forgetful
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

611
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,750
That's Nietzsche.
<i>Beyond Good and Evil.</i>

612
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,080
I found it in my <i>Bartlett's.</i>

613
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,080
What's your <i>Bartlett's?</i>

614
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,040
It's a quote book Patrick.

615
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,000
It's a book of quotations.

616
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,550
I think Howard
will be in <i>Bartlett's</i>
one day.

617
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,590
Definitely.
Howard is pure <i>Bartlett's.</i>

618
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,010
God!

619
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,640
Can you wake him up?

620
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,640
You can't wake him up.

621
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,240
You don't tell me things Joel.

622
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,700
I'm an open book.

623
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,870
I tell you everything.

624
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,160
Every damn embarrassing thing.

625
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,880
You don't trust me.

626
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,460
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

627
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,930
I don't do that.

628
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,390
I want to know you.

629
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,600
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!

630
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,650
People have to
share thingsJoel.

631
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,820
That's what intimacy is.

632
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,820
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

633
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,870
I'm sorry.

634
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,870
It just-- really just
isn't that interesting.

635
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,000
<i>I wanna read some of those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.</i>

636
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,250
<i>What do you write in there
if you don't have any thoughts
or passions or...</i>

637
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,340
<i>love?</i>

638
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:08,220
<i>November 19 2003.</i>

639
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,940
<i>Dinner at Kang's again.</i>

640
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,270
<i>Are we like those poor couples...</i>

641
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,070
<i>you feel sorry for in restaurants?</i>

642
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,530
<i>Are we the dining dead?</i>

643
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:26,280
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

644
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,710
I like that.

645
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,960
How's the chicken?

646
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,050
Good.

647
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,420
More?
No. No. Thank you.

648
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,890
<i>She's gonna be drunk
and stupid now.</i>

649
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,390
Hey would you
do me a favor...

650
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,440
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

651
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,440
Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
It's really...

652
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,610
- Gross.
- gross.

653
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,400
- It's just--
- Repulsive.

654
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,160
It's repulsive.

655
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,580
Patrick can we get through this?

656
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,420
Patrick.

657
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,420
<i>Hey Tangerine.</i>

658
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,630
<i>Oh Patrick it's you.</i>

659
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,960
<i>I'm so miserable right now.</i>

660
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,430
<i>Why? What's wrong?
I don't know.</i>

661
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,430
<i>Excuse me?
I'm so confused!</i>

662
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,430
<i>Can I help you
find something sir?</i>

663
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,520
<i>Confused? What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.</i>

664
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,440
<i>Baby come here.</i>

665
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,520
<i>Scared of what?</i>

666
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,610
<i>Do you love me?
Of course I do.</i>

667
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,610
Where's the self-help section?

668
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,160
<i>Do you think I'm ugly?</i>

669
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,660
<i>No! You're beautiful!</i>

670
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,000
<i>Maybe I should come over.
No no.</i>

671
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,000
<i>I don't know.
I-I'm a mess Patrick.</i>

672
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,750
<i>Well just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.</i>

673
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,710
<i>Okay.</i>

674
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,960
Stan can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

675
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,260
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's--

676
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,260
Let him go Stan!

677
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,260
Let him go. I'll help.

678
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,270
See?
How hard can it be?

679
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,020
- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.

680
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,980
All right.
I'll be right over Tangerine.

681
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,770
You like?

682
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,900
Oh man!

683
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,950
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

684
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,950
I like it.
You do?

685
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,240
You look like a tangerine.

686
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,790
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Juicy!

687
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,330
And seedless.
I like that.

688
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,210
I like tangerines!

689
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,460
Can you see me doing ducks?

690
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,420
Tangerine.
Joel. Ducks.
Quack-quack.

691
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,430
How does he know
to call you that?
How did who know?

692
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,260
Oh my God. Clem?
This is pretty cool.

693
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,270
That's what
they called themselves.

694
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,770
The Clash--
the only band that mattered.

695
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,770
They called themselves that
for a reason.

696
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:02,190
It's amazing isn't it?
Like social justice--
Yeah it's totally incredible.

697
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,820
What Howard
gives to the world.

698
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,900
Yeah.

699
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,410
To let people begin again.

700
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,410
It's beautiful.

701
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:19,420
You look at a baby
and it's so pure and so free
and so clean.

702
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,920
And adults are like
this mess of sadness...

703
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,800
and... phobias.

704
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,920
Howard just makes it all go away.

705
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,810
Oh my God.

706
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,520
Baby what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!

707
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,990
I'm lost I'm scared

708
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,990
I feel like I'm disappearing.

709
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,990
Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!.
I'm getting old!

710
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,990
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.

711
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,290
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh Tangerine.

712
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,670
Nothing makes any sense.

713
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,380
Nothing makes any sense Patrick.
It's okay. It's okay.

714
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,470
Hey let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

715
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,470
Montauk?
Yeah.

716
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,260
No! Come up to Boston with me.
Sure. Yeah.
We can go next weekend.

717
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,560
No no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

718
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,060
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

719
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,070
<i>Hi it's Joel.</i>

720
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:32,320
<i>Um leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.</i>

721
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,870
<i>Pick up! Pick up man!</i>

722
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,700
Hold on hold on hold on.

723
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:44,210
Hello? Yeah what's up?

724
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,380
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

725
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,210
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry man.

726
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,220
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control man.

727
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,850
He's pretty much on autopilot
right now anyway.
<i>Thanks Stan. I owe you big-time.</i>

728
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,680
Dude I gotta go.
I gotta go.

729
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,520
Charles.

730
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,690
Come on Charles.

731
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,620
"Look! You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now Clem.

732
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,910
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want--"

733
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:25,540
I'm so excited. Yea.
I'm excited too!

734
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,460
Cool.
Oh uh I uh--

735
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,420
I got you this...

736
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,550
What?
thing um--

737
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,550
Happy early valentine's Day.

738
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,100
Wow. What is it?

739
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,640
Uh I don't know.
Open it up.

740
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,150
It-- It's gorgeous!

741
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,160
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

742
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,580
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

743
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,620
Thank you.

744
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,590
Let's go.
Okay.

745
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,930
Joely?
Yeah Tangerine?

746
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:21,100
Am I ugly?

747
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,600
When I was a kid
I thought I was.

748
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,770
Can't believe I'm crying already.

749
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:34,690
Sometimes I think people
don't understand how lonely it is
to be a kid.

750
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,780
Like you don't matter.

751
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:41,200
So I'm eight...

752
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,540
and I have these toys

753
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,540
these dolls.

754
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:50,330
My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

755
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,340
And I keep yelling at her:

756
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,760
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

757
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,840
It's weird.

758
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:01,930
Like if I can transform her

759
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,640
I would magically change too.

760
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,310
You're pretty.

761
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,570
Joely don't ever leave me.

762
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:18,650
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

763
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,660
Mierzwiak please
let me keep this memory..

764
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,660
Just this one.

765
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,660
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.

766
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,460
Stop it!

767
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,550
I could die right now Clem.

768
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,760
I'm just...

769
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,760
happy.

770
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,310
I've never felt that before.

771
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,480
I'm just exactly...

772
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,690
where I wanna be.

773
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,780
Clem?

774
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,500
I wanna call it off.

775
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,580
I'll give you a sign.

776
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,920
I wanna call it off!.

777
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,140
Can you hear me?
I don't want this any more!

778
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,560
I wanna call it off!.

779
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:30,180
When you ain't got nothing to do

780
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,270
I think I'll marry you

781
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:36,110
Is anybody there?

782
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,990
Clementine?
Joel?

783
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,330
Clement--
Joely?

784
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,500
Clem!
Joel?

785
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,370
Clem!

786
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,670
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

787
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,170
What? Where?
I have an idea
of how to stop this.

788
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,550
Stop what?

789
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,590
Joely.
Come on Clem.

790
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,930
<i>Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!</i>

791
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,560
<i>Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!</i>

792
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,600
No.
Good.

793
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,020
Concentrate Clem.

794
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,560
We gotta get back
to the office.

795
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,190
There was a tape recorder.
No not the picture.

796
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,280
Not the picture.

797
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,400
Where is it? Back here.
Come on!

798
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,160
Oh look at me.
Hey I look good there.

799
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,910
<i>Look our files are confidential
Mr. Barish</i>

800
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,950
<i>so I can't show you evidence.</i>

801
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,420
<i>Suffice it to say that Miss uh--
Miss Kruczynski...</i>

802
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,340
<i>was not happy
and she wanted to move on.</i>

803
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,920
<i>Good. Now tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.</i>

804
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,890
That's what he said. Then--
What did we see that day?

805
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:47,890
No wait.
Oh look! Hey!

806
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,430
Shit!
We're going to see
my grandma.

807
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,230
Joel why-- No I don't want to--
Joel please!
We're not going on a train.

808
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,060
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!

809
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,480
Mierzwiak!

810
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,480
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!

811
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,830
Please.

812
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:16,250
So why don't we begin
by you telling me...

813
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,420
everything you can remember.

814
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,960
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

815
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:24,090
Oh I-I'm sorry Mr. Barish.

816
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,130
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

817
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,390
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

818
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,390
You're erasing me from her--

819
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,900
I don't know.

820
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,610
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

821
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,610
I'm in my brain.

822
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:46,570
I'm part of your imagination too Joel.

823
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:49,280
How can I help you
from there?

824
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:52,870
Uh I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.

825
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,540
Sorry.

826
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,710
Look. Who's that?

827
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,840
Oh he-he works for us.

828
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,550
That's uh Pa-a-a-a-atrick

829
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,220
baby boy.

830
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,800
He's stealing my identity.

831
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,260
He stole my stuff.

832
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:17,060
He's uh seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

833
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,310
He stole her underwear.
OhJesus Christ!

834
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,310
He stole her underwear.

835
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,780
I could die right now Clem.

836
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,320
I'm just happy.

837
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,990
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where
I want to be.

838
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,540
I want to go home.

839
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,580
Hey. What?

840
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,630
Clem!

841
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,720
Wait. Clem!

842
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,970
Clem?

843
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,510
They're erasing you.

844
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,510
I'm here!

845
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,270
Clem focus.
I hired them okay?

846
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,270
I'm so stupid.

847
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:03,360
Sweetie calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

848
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,780
I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.

849
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,660
Okay well you know
just tell them to cancel it then.

850
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,950
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

851
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,790
Wake yourself up!

852
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,620
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

853
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,580
Okay here we go.
This make you happy if l try?
Yeah.

854
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,670
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

855
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,880
Yeah. Okay.

856
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,180
Boy that's working
like gangbusters.

857
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,800
Don't! That tickles me!
Oh my goodness.

858
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,310
Oh my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the--

859
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,310
It's a birthmark!

860
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,860
I t did work for a second

861
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,480
but I couldn't--
I couldn't move.
See?

862
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:53,200
Oh well isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

863
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,620
It's more important
to prove me wrong
than to actually--

864
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,870
Look I don't want to
discuss this right now okay?

865
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,250
Fine.

866
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,330
Then what? I'm listening.

867
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,090
I don't know.
You erased me.

868
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,840
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this
in the first place.

869
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,840
I'm sorry.
You-- You!

870
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:15,340
You know me. I'm impulsive.

871
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,720
That's what I love
about you.

872
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,060
Joel?

873
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,110
I have another idea
for this problem.

874
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,440
This is a memory of me

875
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:36,200
the way you wanted
to have sex on the couch after you
looked down at my crotch.

876
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,200
What?
Joel the eraser guys
are coming here

877
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:42,250
so what if you take me
somewhere else

878
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,500
somewhere
where I don't belong

879
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,130
and we hide there
till morning?

880
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:54,970
Oh man. I can't remember
anything without you.

881
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:58,180
Tsk that's very sweet
but try okay?

882
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,180
Okay.

883
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:05,560
<i>Row row row your boat
gently down the stream</i>

884
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,860
<i>Merrily merrily
merrily merrily</i>

885
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,570
<i>Row row row your boat
gently down the stream</i>

886
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,570
<i>Row row row your boat
Merrily merrily merrily merrily</i>

887
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:18,320
<i>Life is but a dream
Merrily merrily merrily merrily</i>

888
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:21,160
<i>Merrily merrily
merrily merrily</i>

889
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,500
<i>Life is but a dream
Row row row your boat</i>

890
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,620
- It's working!
<i>Row row row your boat</i>

891
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,250
<i>Gently down the stream</i>
- I'm a genius!

892
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,690
Joel?

893
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,940
Joel?

894
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,860
Where'd you go?

895
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,740
I'm supposed to come too!

896
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,330
Listen I'm just gonna
go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?

897
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,330
Sure.
He just likes to be near me.

898
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,370
Absolutely!
Clem?

899
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:12,590
It worked.
My God look at this!

900
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:16,840
It worked! Look!
Look at this dress man!

901
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,470
Oh my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

902
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,930
Who am I?

903
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,930
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

904
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,560
I must be about four.
Oh my gosh.

905
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,940
Found the salad bowl
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

906
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,480
Is he okay under there?
Peanut are you all right?

907
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:38,280
God honestly I feel like
I could clean up all day.

908
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,410
Listen would you hate me if l asked you
to clean some string beans?
No not at all.

909
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,990
Oh my God.
I love this kitchen.

910
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,080
Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.

911
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,290
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.

912
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:53,670
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

913
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,760
Oh baby Joel.
Hey Joely! Joely!

914
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,340
Is every little peanut
under there okay?
He's fine.

915
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,760
Do you have something to drink?

916
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,470
Would you drink
a cocktail at this hour?
I mean I know it's not 5:00.

917
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,060
I would die for a vodka.
Oh hang on.
Let me check if I have that.

918
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,850
Okay! I'm just
gonna wait right here.
Joel! Hey no sweetie.

919
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,850
Uh Joely.

920
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,570
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.

921
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:20,030
Ice cream.
No not until after you know
you've had your dinner.

922
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,110
Come on Joel!

923
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,120
Joel grow up!

924
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,540
Don't leave me Clem.
Oh my God Clem.

925
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,080
This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.

926
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,420
I want my mommy!
Don't cry baby Joel.

927
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,800
Baby Joel it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

928
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,670
Stop it! Look I think it's working.
Look we're hidden Joel. Look!

929
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,550
Hey honey look.

930
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,640
Wait there.

931
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,730
My crotch is still here
just as you remembered it.

932
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,730
Yuck.

933
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,900
It stopped.

934
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,740
What?
It stopped erasing.

935
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,240
Oh shit.

936
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,280
This is terrible.

937
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:11,120
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

938
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:14,750
Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean? I don't know where!

939
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:18,920
This is bad.
This is very very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

940
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,590
Okay. Crap.

941
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,430
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

942
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,050
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

943
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,350
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

944
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,060
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What do we do?

945
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,730
I don't know.
Now look you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.

946
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:39,650
Well you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

947
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,740
Quiet. You're freaking me out.

948
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,780
All gooey and-- and half-baked.
Hmm that sounds so good.

949
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,830
Oh shit!
I'm hungry.

950
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,830
Oh shit.

951
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:52,330
What? Oh! What what?
What?

952
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:55,330
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No sir man.

953
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,590
This is my--
I can handle this.

954
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:59,960
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.

955
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,720
He's-- There's no time
to fuck around.

956
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,300
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?

957
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,220
Stop fucking around!
Okay I'll call Howard.

958
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:19,360
Hello.
Hello Howard?
Hey it's Stan.

959
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,240
Um I'm working on this guy
down here and we seem to have
lost him for a moment

960
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,070
and uh I can't--
I can't bring him back up.

961
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,580
Okay uh tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

962
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:33,040
Well I wasn't sure really
'cause I was away from the monitor
for a minute...

963
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,830
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to uh--

964
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,830
I had to pee.

965
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,590
<i>Where's Patrick?</i>
Patrick? Patrick had to
go home sick.

966
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:43,590
Ah geez.

967
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:46,430
Okay what's the address?
<i>I know. I'm so sorry.</i>

968
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:50,220
That's okay. Come on.
<i>I'm at 159 South village.</i>

969
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:53,430
Yeah.
<i>Apartment 1E.
Rockville Center.</i>

970
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,190
Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?

971
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:58,190
I'm staying.

972
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,610
- Get your stuff Mary.
- I'm staying.

973
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,190
I think you should go.
Hell no.

974
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,860
Mary-- Shit.

975
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:10,910
I am so stoned.
Please Mary.

976
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,370
You have to go.
Stop being stoned Mary.

977
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:16,250
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

978
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:20,460
Mary you have no idea how much trouble
we're gonna get into if Howard comes--
I look like shit!

979
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,750
Joely stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey Joel!

980
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,640
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.

981
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,270
It's weird how strong
that desire is.
Joel look at me! Look.

982
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:37,640
You'll remember me
in the morning

983
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:40,900
and you'll come to me
and you'll tell me about us
and we'll start over.

984
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,320
Pat? I just-- Pat?

985
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,570
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

986
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,110
That Patrick guy--
he's copying me.

987
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:50,160
What Patrick guy?

988
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,990
That guy!
What?

989
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:53,950
He's here in my apartment.

990
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,950
He's one of those eraser guys.

991
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,330
He fell for you when they were doing you
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you

992
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,750
and you guys are dating.

993
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,050
Really? Is he cute?

994
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:10,840
Clem
there's nothing wrong with you.

995
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,510
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

996
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,520
You-- You're kind

997
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,850
beautiful...

998
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:21,150
and smart and funny...

999
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:23,440
and... nice.

1000
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,730
What?

1001
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,400
Okay. All right.

1002
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,240
Okay.

1003
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,620
Move move move!
Come on. Let's go.
Careful careful.

1004
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,500
Fine.

1005
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,960
Oh my God. I'm still stoned.

1006
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,420
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

1007
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,090
Be cool. Cool.

1008
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,970
Hello Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh hi Howard.

1009
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,970
She was just here to help out.

1010
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,230
I wanted to understand as much
as I could about the procedure
as possible.

1011
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:05,980
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings...

1012
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,230
of the work that we do.

1013
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,030
Well not that I do
but the work that is done...

1014
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,780
by people... where I also work
the work of my colleagues.

1015
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:17,910
All right well
let's see if we can uh

1016
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,540
get to the bottom of this
shall we?

1017
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,580
Uh yeah. Um--

1018
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,800
Well that's odd.
I already tried that.

1019
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,630
Did you try going
through the C-gate?
Yeah of course.

1020
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,510
I mean... yes.

1021
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,800
Yeah.

1022
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,970
All right.

1023
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,440
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

1024
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,810
All right.

1025
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,480
I already-- I ran
the utility programs

1026
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,570
and I had nothing there

1027
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,610
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1028
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,700
Here Howard.
Okay.

1029
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,160
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh thank you.

1030
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,790
You're welcome.

1031
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:04,500
All right I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go through
the entire memory

1032
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,540
see if something comes up.

1033
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:10,000
<i>Oh my darling
Oh my darling</i>

1034
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,220
<i>Oh my darling Clementine</i>

1035
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,800
<i>You were lost
and gone forever</i>
- I love being bathed in the sink.

1036
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:18,350
<i>Dreadful sorry Clementine</i>
- Such a feeling of security.

1037
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,680
I've never seen you happier
baby Joel.

1038
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,680
There it is.

1039
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:28,060
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1040
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,190
What the heck
was he doing there?

1041
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,790
His eyes are open.

1042
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:47,250
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.

1043
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:50,880
Oh this is--
this is not good. No.

1044
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,210
I'm gonna have to--

1045
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,220
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1046
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,240
<i>Can't you see I love you
Antoine?</i>

1047
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:25,500
Okay we're back in.

1048
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:29,790
Wow. That was beautiful
to watch Howard.

1049
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,920
Like a surgeon
or a concert pianist
or something.

1050
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,920
Thank you Mary.

1051
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:40,090
Um Howard
you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

1052
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,720
Why can't you see I love you
Antoine?

1053
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,770
Lucky me.

1054
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:51,270
Lay one on me.

1055
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,530
Don't call me Antoine.

1056
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:56,990
My name is Wally.
Yes I know

1057
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:59,660
but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

1058
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,120
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1059
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,870
Hey.
My God there's people
coming out of your butt.

1060
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,450
There is?

1061
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,040
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

1062
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:14,170
What Joel-- What are you doing?
We gotta go.

1063
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,880
Go on. Please please go.
Please go!

1064
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,640
You can run
but you can't hide.

1065
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,510
Clem come on!

1066
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,470
<i>There I am.</i>

1067
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,480
That truck.

1068
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,440
Doc? Please.

1069
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,650
<i>All right let's begin
by you telling me...</i>

1070
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,490
<i>everything you remember--</i>

1071
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:42,450
That's strange.
He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1072
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:46,580
Oh well at least
we know where he is.
He's back on track right?

1073
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,580
Come on Clem.

1074
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,710
<i>He seems to have developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.</i>

1075
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:54,380
I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.

1076
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,970
Come on come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper
somewhere really buried.

1077
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:02,760
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.

1078
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:06,560
Humiliation.
<i>Come onyou big baby!</i>

1079
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,560
I'm sorry okay?

1080
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,940
Let me drive you home.

1081
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,440
No!

1082
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,950
- Bye Howard.
- No wait. Howard.

1083
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,280
He's disappeared again.

1084
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,580
Oh dear.
I'm so sorry Howard.

1085
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,620
Humiliation.

1086
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,330
Humiliation.

1087
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:35,420
Hu-mi-lia--
Joel.

1088
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,630
I don't like it either.

1089
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,260
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to--

1090
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:43,300
Joel honey I have a surprise--
I just--

1091
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,180
Uh you know what honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

1092
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,100
Good night sweetheart.

1093
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,480
No.

1094
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,560
I'm sorry Joel. Joely.
Shut up.

1095
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,690
Look! Joel!

1096
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,690
Joel look!
What?

1097
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,700
Look where we are!

1098
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,700
Clem this isn't good.

1099
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,620
Then hide me somewhere--
somewhere really buried.

1100
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:17,130
Hit it! Hit it!
I can't! I gotta go home.

1101
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,590
I'll do it later!

1102
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,260
Come on you big sissy!

1103
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,980
Ooh he has a girlfriend!

1104
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:42,690
Wait. What am I doing?
You know something Freddy?
And he loves her!

1105
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,990
You don't scare me anymore.

1106
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,030
Joel!

1107
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:49,950
Joely get up.
Come on it's not worth it.
Hit him! Hit him!

1108
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:54,580
They're not worth itJoel!
He's not listening!

1109
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,710
Come onJoel.
Stupid!

1110
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,720
<i>I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.</i>

1111
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,050
<i>You were a little kid.
Yeah?</i>

1112
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:11,760
<i>Come on.
That's where I live-- lived.</i>

1113
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:14,100
<i>I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.</i>

1114
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,850
<i>Do you like my pink hat?
Here look feel better.
You can really kill me this time.</i>

1115
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,560
<i>It's my turn.
Go. One two three.
I can? You're really gonna die though.</i>

1116
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,860
<i>Okay.
One two three.</i>

1117
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,400
<i>You're dead.</i>

1118
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:28,780
<i>Oh my mom.
It's-- It's okay. We're playing.</i>

1119
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,530
<i>Hi Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.</i>

1120
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,830
<i>Okay are you dead yet?</i>

1121
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,040
<i>You're dead!</i>

1122
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,040
Uh I think I got the hang of this.

1123
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,340
I still don't understand it
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1124
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:58,730
Clem!

1125
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:02,020
Clem!

1126
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,960
Jo--Joely?

1127
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,170
Are you okay Joel?

1128
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:23,500
Joel? Joel?

1129
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:26,420
Oh my God.
That was terrible.

1130
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,420
Okay okay.
That was like three seconds.

1131
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:32,390
All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more then I get to go.

1132
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,390
Okay.

1133
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,740
Look at this.
This is so cool!

1134
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,950
Cool. Look out! Look out!

1135
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:55,030
Shit!
It's fluff.

1136
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,620
Our house!

1137
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,120
Come on.
Come on.

1138
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:04,130
Come on.
We gotta go!

1139
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,880
Come on!

1140
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,840
We gotta go. Clem?

1141
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:14,800
We gotta go.

1142
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,810
Come on!

1143
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:19,060
No!
This is a really bad time
for this!

1144
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,060
Get off me! Oh God!

1145
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,060
I don't even know
where we're going.
It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1146
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,650
It's the best place.
No this way.
No this way.

1147
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:32,360
No no no. This way.
You're no help at all.

1148
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:35,160
What's wrong with you?

1149
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,410
Let go of me Joel!

1150
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,050
I like watching you work
Howard.

1151
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:58,640
I guess uh--

1152
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,520
I guess I'll go out
for-- for some air

1153
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,600
if nobody minds.

1154
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:06,860
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

1155
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,860
Yeah that's uh--

1156
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,860
that's fine.

1157
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,580
Do you like quotes Howard?

1158
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:26,580
What do you mean?

1159
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:29,380
Oh you know
like famous quotes?

1160
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,590
I find reading them inspirational

1161
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:35,550
and in my reading
I've come across some
I thought you might like too.

1162
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:39,310
Oh well I--
I'd love to hear some.

1163
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,810
There's one that goes

1164
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:45,350
"Blessed are the forgetful
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

1165
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,400
That's Nietzsche right?
Yeah.

1166
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,440
And here I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.
Oh no.

1167
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,650
It's-- It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1168
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:56,740
Yeah. Oh and there's
this other one I like.

1169
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:59,620
It's by Pope Alexander
and it goes--

1170
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,160
Alexander Pope?
Oh yeah.

1171
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,160
Yeah shit.

1172
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:08,080
It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"
and sound like a dope

1173
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,130
and then I go ahead and say it.

1174
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:13,760
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

1175
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:19,510
The quote goes "How happy is
the blameless vestal's lot?

1176
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,850
The world forgetting
by the world forgot.

1177
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,270
Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind.

1178
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,900
Each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned."

1179
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:36,950
I want to be
a great big huge elephant...

1180
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:39,490
with a huge trunk like that.

1181
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:43,830
Clem? Clementine?

1182
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:46,830
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1183
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:49,880
I just thought it would
be appropriate maybe.

1184
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:58,220
I really admire
the work you do Howard.

1185
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,800
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh it's fine. It's fine.

1186
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:03,390
I-I-I-I-I--
I'm happy to hear--

1187
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,150
I'm sorry.

1188
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:16,530
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1189
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,160
I shouldn't have said that.
Oh Mary no.

1190
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,450
It's-- You're a wonderful girl.

1191
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:29,210
But I-- You know
I have a wife and kids.

1192
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:31,250
You know
I have a wife and kids.

1193
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,250
Oh Mary.

1194
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,260
Oh Mary we can't do this.

1195
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:57,940
Well good morning
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1196
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,330
What?
Oh my God!

1197
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:09,960
Who is it?

1198
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,750
Uh--

1199
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:25,640
Thank you Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1200
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:32,440
Hollis. Hollis!

1201
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,940
Hollis!

1202
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,150
Wait. Wait wait wait.
Hollis.

1203
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,950
- I knew it Howard.
- Hollis it didn't start out
to be like this.

1204
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:44,410
I came here to work.
Hollis this is a one-time mistake!

1205
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,950
I'm a stupid girl
with a stupid crush!
Yeah.

1206
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:49,500
I swear I basically
forced him into it!

1207
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,330
Don't be a monster Howard.
Tell the girl.

1208
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,750
Tell me what?

1209
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,800
Oh you poor kid.

1210
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,930
You can have him.

1211
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,930
You did.

1212
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,440
What?

1213
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,870
we have a history.

1214
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,500
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1215
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,710
You--

1216
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,290
You wanted it done...

1217
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,670
so you could get past uh--

1218
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,380
You could-- Yeah.

1219
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:51,810
Um I have to uh
finish the work in there.

1220
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,890
It's almost morning.

1221
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,060
We'll talk later.

1222
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:00,020
Okay?

1223
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,950
Hey.

1224
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:18,880
Let me give you a lift home.

1225
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:31,010
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1226
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,680
Hi.
Hi.

1227
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:38,690
Didn't figure you'd show your face
around me again.

1228
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,980
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

1229
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:44,030
You did run away
after all.

1230
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:46,860
I just needed to see ya.

1231
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:49,240
Yeah?

1232
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,030
I'd like to um

1233
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,080
take you out or something.

1234
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,710
You're married.

1235
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:00,210
Not yet. Not married.

1236
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,210
No I'm not married no.

1237
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:05,340
Look man
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance

1238
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:09,970
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1239
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,350
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1240
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,560
If you wanna be with me
you're with me.

1241
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,810
Okay.

1242
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:20,770
Too many guys think I'm a concept
or I complete them

1243
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,650
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1244
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:27,360
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1245
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:32,070
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech
really well.

1246
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:35,660
I had you pegged didn't I?
You had the whole
human race pegged.

1247
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:37,710
Probably.

1248
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,210
I still thought you were
gonna save my life

1249
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:44,210
even after that.

1250
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,670
I know.

1251
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:52,010
It would be different...

1252
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,560
if we could just give it
another go around.

1253
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,900
Remember me.

1254
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,940
Try your best.

1255
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,240
Maybe we can.

1256
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,440
<i>Okay so just tell me
what you remember</i>

1257
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,110
<i>and uh then we'll
take it from there.</i>

1258
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,400
<i>Okay.</i>

1259
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,360
<i>I liked you immediately.</i>

1260
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,950
<i>You didn't
come on to me at all.</i>

1261
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,990
<i>I liked that.</i>

1262
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,040
<i>I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.</i>

1263
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,790
<i>I wanted you to think
I was smart.</i>

1264
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,330
<i>I couldn't wait
to come to work.</i>

1265
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:08,880
<i>I had these fantasies
of us being married...</i>

1266
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,340
<i>and having kids and... just--</i>

1267
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,090
<i>Oh Howie I can't do this.</i>

1268
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,760
<i>We agreed it's for the best Mary.</i>

1269
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:20,310
<i>Yeah I know.</i>

1270
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,310
<i>Oh God.</i>

1271
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,730
I'll take the bottom and you--
Uh-uh-uh! No no no. Here.

1272
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,730
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

1273
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:29,320
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey the cooler is--

1274
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,990
That's light huh?
Oh I can get that.
You can get it.

1275
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:33,990
No no no no!

1276
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,200
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.

1277
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,290
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1278
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,250
<i>This is the day we met.</i>

1279
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:47,540
<i>You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out
in the distance.</i>

1280
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:49,750
<i>I remember being drawn to you
even then.</i>

1281
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,920
<i>I thought "Wow how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."</i>

1282
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,890
<i>You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...</i>

1283
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,930
<i>and even hate eventually.</i>

1284
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:04,980
But at the time I thought
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1285
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,770
Hi there.

1286
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:09,820
Hi.

1287
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,820
I saw you sitting over here...

1288
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,820
by yourself

1289
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,780
and I thought "Thank God.

1290
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:20,620
Someone normal
who doesn't know how to interact
at these things either."

1291
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,830
Yeah.

1292
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:25,960
I don't ever know what to say.

1293
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,750
I'm Clementine.

1294
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:31,960
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1295
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:34,300
And then you just took it...

1296
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,880
without waiting for an answer.

1297
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:42,930
It was so intimate

1298
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,140
like we were already lovers.

1299
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:49,020
I'm Joel.

1300
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,230
HiJoel.

1301
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,530
So no jokes about my name.

1302
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:59,070
You mean like--
<i>Oh my darling oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine</i>

1303
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,660
Huckleberry Hound
that sort of thing?

1304
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,740
Yeah. Like that.

1305
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,750
Oh no jokes. No jokes.

1306
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:09,540
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1307
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,880
I think your name is magical.

1308
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,100
This is it Joel.

1309
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:23,390
It's gonna be gone soon.

1310
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,850
I know.

1311
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:29,850
What do we do?

1312
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,730
Enjoy it.

1313
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,710
You married?
No.

1314
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:56,420
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1315
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,380
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1316
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:01,800
Male or female?
What?

1317
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:04,310
Female. Female.

1318
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,940
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1319
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:16,730
You know these people?
No of course not.
Come on.

1320
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:19,650
They might have a dog.

1321
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:23,370
There's no dog.

1322
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:25,490
What are you doing?

1323
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:28,790
It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.

1324
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,750
- Clementine!
- There we go.

1325
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:45,100
Come on man.
The water's fine.

1326
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:48,310
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1327
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:52,980
It's dark.

1328
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:57,020
So uh what's
your girlfriend's name?

1329
01:27:57,110 --> 01:28:00,360
Naomi but we're not really--
I mean--

1330
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,820
We're--
Whatever.

1331
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,990
So this is great.
Now I can look for um
candles matches...

1332
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:09,540
and the liquor cabinet.

1333
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:12,870
Oh God.

1334
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:19,300
I think we should go.

1335
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:21,970
There's no phone line.
What?

1336
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:24,220
I think we should go.
Why?

1337
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,890
It's our house...
just for tonight.

1338
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,930
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1339
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:33,480
Which one do you want to be?
Uh--

1340
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:37,020
I prefer to be Ruth
but I can be flexible.

1341
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:41,900
What are you do--

1342
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:44,200
Alcohol!
Oh boy.

1343
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,870
So are you okay with wine?

1344
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:49,580
I don't know.
Well you choose the wine.

1345
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:53,910
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

1346
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,090
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.

1347
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,930
I've gotta catch my ride.

1348
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,260
So go.

1349
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:11,430
I did.

1350
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,390
I thought maybe you were a nut

1351
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,270
but you were exciting.

1352
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,320
I wish you'd stayed.

1353
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:23,070
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1354
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:26,200
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1355
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,620
Oh God I wish I had--

1356
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:35,710
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1357
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:40,340
Well I came back downstairs
and you were gone.
I walked out. I walked out the door.

1358
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:43,260
Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.

1359
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:46,680
I was like--
It was above my head.
I don't know.

1360
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,680
You were scared?

1361
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,680
Yeah.

1362
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,350
Thought you knew that
about me.

1363
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:58,400
<i>I ran back to the bonfire
trying to outrun my humiliation I think.</i>

1364
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:02,110
Was it something I said?
Yeah.

1365
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,280
You said "So go"...

1366
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,820
with such disdain you know?

1367
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:12,540
Oh I'm sorry.
It's okay.

1368
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,040
Joely?

1369
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,960
What if you stayed this time?

1370
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:28,260
I walked out the door.

1371
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,260
There's no memory left.

1372
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:33,470
Come back and make up
a good-bye at least.

1373
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,470
Let's pretend we had one.

1374
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:49,070
ByeJoel.

1375
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,120
I love you.

1376
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:55,450
Meet me in Montauk.

1377
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,290
<i>I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.</i>

1378
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:07,470
<i>You were operating the plane
with the remote control
and then it crashed.</i>

1379
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:09,880
<i>It was fucking windy.
Come on man.</i>

1380
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:11,930
<i>You're stoned and you're driving.</i>

1381
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:14,560
<i>Yeah the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.</i>

1382
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,140
<i>That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking
then I'll smoke it.</i>

1383
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:20,850
<i>It does.
That's a medical fact.</i>

1384
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,360
<i>It was proven
on the Science Network.</i>

1385
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,860
<i>Honey just watch the road.
I can't see shit.</i>

1386
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,450
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

1387
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:34,330
She was nice.
Yeah man. Who was that?

1388
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:39,750
She was um just a girl.

1389
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:50,130
Okay.

1390
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:28,380
So I gotta--
I gotta drop the van off.

1391
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,550
Thanks Stan. Thanks.

1392
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:33,970
We'll talk.

1393
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,010
Hey!

1394
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:57,010
Hey.

1395
01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:01,180
You got a lot
of your stuff there I see.
Yeah that's right. My stuff.

1396
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:04,730
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.

1397
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:08,520
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.

1398
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,190
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not. God no.

1399
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,440
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1400
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:18,740
Once maybe.

1401
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:21,830
I was coming back from a job
and you were at his car.

1402
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:24,500
I saw you two talking.

1403
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:28,290
So I waved to you
and you giggled you know.

1404
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,670
How'd I look?

1405
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:34,050
You looked happy.

1406
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:36,380
Happy with a secret.

1407
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,720
And after that?

1408
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,930
I never saw you two together
again like that so I just--

1409
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,730
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

1410
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:08,660
Montauk train
now boarding on track "B." All aboard.

1411
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:14,000
I really like you Mary Svevo.

1412
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:17,470
You know that?

1413
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,520
Thanks.

1414
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:05,220
Let me get my toothbrush.

1415
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,770
Yeah. Just--

1416
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,950
<i>Where are you Clem?
I'm worried.</i>

1417
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:27,410
<i>I feel like you're mad at me
and I don't know what I did.</i>

1418
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:30,250
<i>What did I do?</i>

1419
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:32,750
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1420
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:34,830
<i>I'll do anything
to make you happy.</i>

1421
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,170
<i>Tell me what you want me to do
and I'll do it.</i>

1422
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:41,010
<i>Listen I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.</i>

1423
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:57,020
Vamonos senor.

1424
01:36:57,110 --> 01:37:00,280
I-I had a really nice time
last night.

1425
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,950
Nice?

1426
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:06,280
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life...

1427
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,280
last night.

1428
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:10,330
That's better.

1429
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:17,630
This is weird.
<i>To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.</i>

1430
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:21,210
<i>My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met
but you don't remember me.</i>

1431
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:25,720
<i>I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased."</i>

1432
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,300
<i>I have since decided
that this is a horrible--</i>
- Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1433
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:32,980
<i>In order to correct this
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.</i>

1434
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:36,650
<i>My name is Clementine Kruczynski.</i>

1435
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:39,440
<i>I'm here to erase Joel Barish.</i>

1436
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,730
What is this?
I don't know.

1437
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:46,410
<i>He's boring.
Is that enough reason
to erase someone?</i>

1438
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:50,160
<i>I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now</i>

1439
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,200
<i>and it's like he changed me.</i>

1440
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:56,040
<i>I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.</i>

1441
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:00,670
<i>I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic wimpy apologetic smile.</i>

1442
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,960
<i>That sort of wounded puppy shit
he does you know?</i>
- What are you doing?

1443
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:06,470
- I'm not doing anything.
<i>The bloom is certainly
fucking off the rose at this point.</i>

1444
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:09,510
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

1445
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,060
- You are screwing with me.
-Joel I'm not!

1446
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:16,480
- You clearly are.
- Look let's just take a minute and--

1447
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:47,090
Patrick get the fuck away.

1448
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,550
Oh sweetheart--
Get the fuck away from me!

1449
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,850
Can we talk about it?
No! Get the fuck away!

1450
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:27,380
Joel Barish.

1451
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:30,220
Hey Clementine.
Hey.

1452
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,510
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1453
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,470
Yeah.

1454
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,520
<i>Really very educated.</i>

1455
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:42,020
<i>I mean she's smart I think
but not educated.</i>

1456
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,020
<i>I couldn't really talk to her
about books you know?</i>

1457
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:48,530
<i>She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.</i>

1458
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:51,990
<i>Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.</i>

1459
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:54,700
<i>Sometimes--
I was embarrassed in public...</i>

1460
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,790
- Hi.
<i>because she would pronounce...</i>

1461
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:59,620
<i>Library "libary."</i>
- Hi.

1462
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:02,830
<i>Libary. Li-berry.</i>

1463
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,840
Look what I found.

1464
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:09,220
<i>I think if there's
a truly seductive quality
about Clementine</i>

1465
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,970
<i>it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.</i>

1466
01:40:14,350 --> 01:40:16,680
You made me look skinny.

1467
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:19,310
<i>Amazing burning meteorite...</i>

1468
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:23,690
<i>will carry you to another world
where things are exciting.</i>

1469
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:26,770
<i>But what you quickly learn
is that...</i>

1470
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:29,690
<i>it's really an elaborate ruse.</i>

1471
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:31,740
- I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1472
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,080
- It's okay.
So flashy
in a kind of obvious way.

1473
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:40,370
<i>But still it seduces you.</i>
J- oel I really like you.

1474
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:42,670
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1475
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:47,210
- Let me turn this off okay?
- Hey it's-- it's only fair.

1476
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:50,510
<i>Where's the real Clementine?</i>

1477
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:53,720
<i>I mean the whole thing with the hair--
it's all bullshit.</i>

1478
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,510
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1479
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,810
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1480
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:00,810
<i>I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.</i>

1481
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:04,520
<i>Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.</i>
- You want a drink or something?

1482
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:07,310
Do you have any whiskey?

1483
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:12,700
<i>No I don't think her sex
is... motivated.</i>

1484
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:15,780
<i>I saw it clearly
the last night we were together.</i>

1485
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,240
<i>It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.</i>

1486
01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:22,370
- Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1487
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:26,130
<i>The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her...</i>

1488
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:29,000
<i>is to fuck 'em...</i>

1489
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:33,340
<i>or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of 'em.</i>

1490
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:36,340
<i>And she's so desperate
and insecure...</i>

1491
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:41,220
<i>that she'll sooner or later
go around fucking everybody.</i>

1492
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:44,310
- I don't do that.
- I wouldn't think that
about you.

1493
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:47,310
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1494
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:50,610
Because it really hurts me
that you said that
because I don't do that.

1495
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:53,780
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry about all this. I'm gonna... go.

1496
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:58,660
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

1497
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:06,460
Um... bye.

1498
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:09,170
Bye.
<i>I thought I knew her so well.</i>

1499
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:12,840
It was nice meeting you and all.
<i>But I don't know her at all.</i>

1500
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:17,510
<i>What a loss to spend
that much time with someone</i>

1501
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:21,470
<i>only to find out
that she's a stranger.</i>

1502
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:26,770
Wait.

1503
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,400
What?
I don't know.

1504
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,610
Just wait. Just wait.
What do you want Joel?

1505
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:37,240
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.

1506
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:53,460
Okay.
Really?

1507
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:57,680
I'm not a concept Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking
for my own peace of mind.

1508
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,680
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1509
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,430
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.

1510
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:08,140
You know you will think of things
and I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped...

1511
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:10,270
because that's what happens
with me.

1512
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:13,690
Okay.

1513
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,410
Okay.

1514
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:26,660
Okay.
Okay.
