1
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:35,045
Montauk train on track "B."

2
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:39,466
Random thoughts
for Valentine's Day, 2004.

3
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:43,804
Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...

4
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:48,392
to make people
feel like crap.

5
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,063
I ditched work today.

6
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,483
Took a train out to Montauk.

7
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,905
I don't know why.

8
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,158
I'm not an impulsive person.

9
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,545
I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.

10
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,964
I gotta get my car fixed.

11
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,005
Hi. Cindy?

12
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,468
It's Joel. Joel!

13
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,472
Listen, I don't
feel very well today.

14
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,556
No, food poisoning,
I think.

15
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:33,061
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

16
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:35,689
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.

17
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,483
Page is ripped out.

18
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,988
Don't remember doing that.

19
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,118
It appears this is
my first entry in two years.

20
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:58,920
Sand is overrated.

21
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,132
It's just tiny little rocks.

22
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,436
If only I could
meet someone new.

23
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:18,356
I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished,

24
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,028
seeing that I'm incapable of making
eye contact with a woman I don't know.

25
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:27,324
Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi.

26
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:30,077
She was nice.
Nice is good.

27
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:34,704
She loved me.

28
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,746
Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see...

29
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,708
who shows me
the least bit of attention?

30
00:04:57,956 --> 00:04:59,874
Hi.

31
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,834
I'm sorry?

32
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,505
- I just said hi.
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

33
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:09,259
Okay if I sit closer?

34
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:12,385
How far are you going?

35
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:14,639
Uh, Rockville Center.

36
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:17,017
Get out! Me too!

37
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,020
- Really?
- What are the odds?

38
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:24,274
Do I know you?

39
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:28,987
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

40
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,198
- Sure. Sure.
- That's it!

41
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,658
- Yeah?
- I've seen you, man!

42
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,871
Book slave there
for, like, five years now.

43
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:41,333
- Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you.
- Jesus! Is it five years?

44
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,460
It might be the hair.

45
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,670
- What might?
- It changes a lot.

46
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:49,049
The color. That's why you
might not recognize me.

47
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:52,803
- It's called Blue Ruin, the color.
- Right. Yeah.

48
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:55,180
- Snappy name, huh?
- I like it.

49
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:57,682
Yeah.

50
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,811
Anyway, this company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names.

51
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:05,357
Red... Red Menace, Yellow
Fever, Green Revolution.

52
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,360
That'd be a job,
coming up with those names.

53
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:11,363
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

54
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:14,991
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? Fifty, maybe.

55
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:17,077
Someone's got that job.

56
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:22,207
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.

57
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,168
I apply my personality
in a paste.

58
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,210
Oh, I doubt that very much.

59
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:29,715
Well, you don't know me,
so...

60
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,926
you don't know, do you?

61
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,182
Sorry. I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.

62
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:43,019
Yeah. I got it.

63
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:05,500
- My name's Clementine, by the way.
- I'm Joel.

64
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,919
- Hi, Joel.
- Hey.

65
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,505
No jokes about my name.

66
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,884
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.

67
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,888
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

68
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:20,098
Huckleberry Hound.

69
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:22,726
I don't know what that means.

70
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,937
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

71
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:28,021
It's been suggested.

72
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:31,109
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin'
Oh my darlin' Clementine

73
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:34,279
You were lost and gone forever

74
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:35,946
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

75
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:37,947
No?

76
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,912
I'm sorry. Just... It's a pretty
name, though. It really is nice.

77
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:43,955
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."

78
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,039
Right? Clemency?

79
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,251
Although it hardly fits.

80
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,629
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

81
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,131
Gee, I-I wouldn't
think that about you.

82
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,385
- Why wouldn't you think that about me?
- I don't know.

83
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,678
I just...

84
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,098
I don't know.
I just, uh...

85
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,139
You seem nice, so...

86
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:05,185
Oh, now I'm nice?

87
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:08,438
Oh, God. Don't you know
any other adjectives?

88
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
I don't need "nice."

89
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:14,486
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't
need anybody else to be it at me.

90
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,324
Joel?

91
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,661
It's Joel, right?

92
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:25,163
Yes.

93
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,666
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

94
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:31,253
I'm a little out of sorts today.

95
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,886
My embarrassing admission is,

96
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,850
I really like
that you're nice right now.

97
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:49,730
I mean, I can't tell from one moment
to the next what I'm gonna like,

98
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,815
but right now...

99
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,943
I'm glad you are.

100
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,329
I have so much stuff
that, uh, I probably should, uh...

101
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,500
- Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
- I-I'm writing, and...

102
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,669
- No, no. I just...
- Sure. No. That's okay.

103
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:15,338
- I just have... You know, this is...
- Okay.

104
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,799
- Ohh! Hey!
- Take care, then.

105
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:19,883
Jesus!

106
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:37,110
Hi. I could, uh,
give you a ride, if you need.

107
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:39,194
It's cold.

108
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,155
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah?

109
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:43,115
It is frosty.

110
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,911
- You're not a stalker or anything, right?
- I'm not a stalker.

111
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:48,080
You're the one that talked to me. Remember?

112
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:50,415
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

113
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,626
Really?
There's a stalker book?

114
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,920
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

115
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,297
I gotta read that one.

116
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:06,807
Look, I'm sorry if I came off
sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

117
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,268
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.

118
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,985
Do you wanna have a drink?

119
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:21,238
I have lots of drinks,
and I could...

120
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,321
Um...

121
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,323
Never mind.

122
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,703
- Sorry. That was stupid. I'm embarrassed now.
- No, no, no, no.

123
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,786
Good night, Joel.

124
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,351
Two Blue Ruins.

125
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,228
Thank you.

126
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:56,229
Drink up, young man.

127
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:59,025
It'll make the whole
seduction part less repugnant.

128
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm just kidding!

129
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,324
Come on.

130
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,291
You're kinda closed-mouthed,
aren't you?

131
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:16,332
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:20,839
It's just, you know,
my life isn't that interesting.

133
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,509
I go to work, I come home.

134
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:28,096
Don't know what to say.

135
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,180
You should read my journal.

136
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:34,644
I mean, it's just... blank.

137
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,981
Really? Does that make
you sad or anxious?

138
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:41,359
I mean, I'm always anxious, thinking
I'm not living my life to the fullest,

139
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:43,443
taking advantage
of every possibility,

140
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:47,365
making sure I'm not wasting one
second of the little time I have.

141
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:49,951
- I think about that.
- Yeah?

142
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:56,373
You're really nice.

143
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,211
Ohh! God, I have to stop saying that.

144
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:03,463
I'm gonna marry you.

145
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:05,507
I know it.

146
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,677
Um... okay.

147
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:17,354
Joel, you should come up
to the Charles with me sometime.

148
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:19,396
It gets frozen this time of year.

149
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:21,566
- That sounds scary.
- Exactly.

150
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:24,651
I'll pack a picnic.

151
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,572
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.

152
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,532
And, um, we could...

153
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,533
Sounds good.

154
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:35,122
But I... I should, uh, go.
Now.

155
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:37,205
You should stay.

156
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:39,418
No, I really... I'm... I...

157
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:41,501
I have to get up so early.

158
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:43,503
I would like you
to call me.

159
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:46,258
Would you do that?
I would like it.

160
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:48,343
Yes.

161
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:54,599
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

162
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,683
That'd be nice.

163
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,309
What took you so long?

164
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:41,311
I just walked in.

165
00:13:41,313 --> 00:13:43,940
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

166
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,234
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

167
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:48,318
Oh!

168
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,239
You said "I do."
I guess that means we're married.

169
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:53,323
I guess so.

170
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:55,786
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

171
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:58,288
It's really solid
this time of year.

172
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,289
Whoa! I don't know.

173
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,290
Come on. Come on.

174
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,292
Come on.
Come on, come on.

175
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:11,301
Oh. So beautiful.

176
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,511
Isn't it?

177
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,516
Uh, don't go too far.

178
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:22,312
- Whoo! Oww! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!

179
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:25,565
- Are you okay?
- Ouch! Fuck it.

180
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,361
Ohh! Oh, my ass!

181
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:34,366
- I think I should go back.
- Come on. Come on!

182
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,408
What if it breaks?

183
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,371
- "What if"? Do you really care right now?
- Huh?

184
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,581
Come here. Please.

185
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,665
Come on.

186
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,717
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.

187
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,053
- This is good.
- Here, let me show you this one thing.

188
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,180
What are you doing?

189
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,682
Come on.

190
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,565
Think I heard a crack.

191
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:12,362
It's not gonna crack
or break or...

192
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:14,406
It's so thick.

193
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:18,702
Show me which constellations
you know.

194
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:21,371
Um... Oh.

195
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:24,082
I don't... know any.

196
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,794
Show me
which ones you know.

197
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,255
Okay.

198
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,924
Okay.

199
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:36,470
Oh. Here's Osidius.

200
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:38,553
Where?

201
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,555
Right there.
See?

202
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,351
Sort of a swoop
and a cross.

203
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:45,435
Osidius the Emphatic.

204
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,775
- You're full of shit. Right?
- Nope.

205
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,778
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.

206
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,906
Shut the fuck up!

207
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:09,084
Clementine.

208
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:11,296
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

209
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,924
- Hey.
Hey.

210
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:18,970
- Hey.
- Sorry to wake you, but we're... here.

211
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:31,108
Can I come over to your house...

212
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:33,819
to sleep?

213
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:36,780
I'm so tired.

214
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:39,658
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.

215
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,619
- Let me get my toothbrush.
- Yeah. Oh.

216
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:46,957
Just...

217
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:05,475
Yes?

218
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:09,980
- Can I help you?
- What do you mean?

219
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:13,483
Can I help you with something?

220
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:16,153
No.

221
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,530
What are you doing here?

222
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:21,158
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

223
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
Oh.

224
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,871
Thanks.

225
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:17,023
- We're looking for 159.
- What number's that?

226
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:19,107
I don't know where that is.

227
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:22,028
Jesus Christ, you'd think they'd light
the number, or at least put a number on...

228
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:24,112
- Is that him?
- I think so.

229
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:27,200
Yeah, that's him.
Wait. That's him.

230
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,507
- Hey, Joel.
- Frank.

231
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:49,389
Oh, shit.

232
00:19:49,473 --> 00:19:53,894
Jesus. The only Valentine's Day
cards I get are from my mother.

233
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:55,977
How pathetic is that, huh?

234
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:57,979
You're lucky
you have Clementine, man.

235
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,981
She is way cool.

236
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,486
Hey, you got any big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

237
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,530
No.

238
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:10,494
Well, it's only a day away. Better
make some reservations or something.

239
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:12,662
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's. Right?

240
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,746
McRomance!

241
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:17,209
You want some fries
with that shake?

242
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,586
I have to, uh,
go to sleep now, Frank.

243
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,838
It's 8:30.

244
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:52,411
Patrick, stop it.

245
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,680
Ohh! Okay.

246
00:21:11,763 --> 00:21:14,182
Okay. Okay.

247
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:17,602
Whew. Okay.

248
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,690
Showtime at the Apollo.

249
00:21:30,615 --> 00:21:33,577
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

250
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:35,746
Quiet.

251
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Hey, Joel. What's up?

252
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:52,802
Oh. Hi, Frank.

253
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,105
I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom.

254
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:05,108
How pathetic is that?

255
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,150
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

256
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:11,114
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

257
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:13,156
No.

258
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:15,158
It's only a day away.

259
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,621
Better make a reservation
or something.

260
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:19,662
Don't wanna end up
at Mickey D's.

261
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:22,167
Oh, no!

262
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,504
Yes! Valentine's Day is three
goddamn days away! I want it resolved.

263
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:28,715
I'm willing to be
the one to resolve it.

264
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,135
So I call her,
and she's changed her number.

265
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:35,305
So I walked over to Antic Attic,
you know, to get her something.

266
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:39,309
I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early valentine, and...

267
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:43,019
You won't believe it.

268
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:45,774
She's there with...

269
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:49,528
this guy,
this really young guy.

270
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:53,073
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

271
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:55,575
Excuse me?

272
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:58,328
Can I help you
find something, sir?

273
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:04,249
Hey, Clem-ato.

274
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:07,337
Patrick! Baby boy.

275
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:12,592
- What you doing here, baby?
- Just came to surprise you.

276
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:15,554
Let me know if you need something, sir.
You look good.

277
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,637
Hi.

278
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:20,726
- How are you?
- Pretty good. Pretty bored. Pretty tired.

279
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:22,809
Uh-huh.

280
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:25,939
- I so want what's in your suit.
- Oh, good.

281
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,493
Why?

282
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:41,038
Why would she do that to me?

283
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,461
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

284
00:23:47,544 --> 00:23:50,130
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

285
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:52,213
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

286
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:54,215
- I know, honey.
- For being honest.

287
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:56,470
- It's horrible.
- I should just go to her house.

288
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:59,473
No! No, no, no. You don't wanna go
there, man. You don't wanna go there.

289
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,933
Get off. It's too...

290
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,975
- Right.
- Yeah.

291
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,977
I don't want to seem desperate.

292
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:10,567
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,
make a clean break. Right?

293
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,779
Right?

294
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:17,949
All right, Joel,
look, man, seriously.

295
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,991
- Rob!
- Here's the deal.

296
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:23,163
Don't do that. Rob, what are
you doing? No, no, no, no.

297
00:24:23,246 --> 00:24:26,416
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

298
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,002
You're gonna make this about our
shit now? This isn't about us.

299
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:33,131
I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult. Okay?

300
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:35,217
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

301
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,471
- What are you...
- That's your laundry!

302
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:44,434
That's great.
That's good.

303
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:56,446
Okay.

304
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,666
What is it? I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.

305
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:21,555
Good morning. Lacuna.

306
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:25,559
No, I'm sorry. That offer
expired after the new year.

307
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:31,481
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

308
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:33,859
How about on the fifth?

309
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,320
That's a Wednesday. All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

310
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:41,908
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

311
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:45,579
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

312
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:47,662
May I help you?

313
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:50,584
- I'm Joel Barish.
- Excuse me?

314
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:54,212
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...

315
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:56,296
Mierzwiak.

316
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:59,593
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

317
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,678
- You still need to fill the form out, sir.
- Really?

318
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,848
- Thank you.
- Great.

319
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,890
I don't have a pen.

320
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:10,020
There's a pen right there.

321
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:12,062
Good morning. Lacuna.

322
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:15,942
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.

323
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:18,028
Mr. Barish?

324
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:22,405
How are we today?

325
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:24,407
Not too good, actually.

326
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:26,409
Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!

327
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:29,331
- Sorry. Sorry, I was just...
- I'm working!

328
00:26:29,414 --> 00:26:32,709
Sorry. Sorry.

329
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:34,753
- Here, Doctor.
- Thank you.

330
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:37,754
You should not have seen this.

331
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:39,758
I apologize.

332
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:46,098
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

333
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:48,975
- I assure you, no.
- No.

334
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:57,150
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

335
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:01,863
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

336
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:04,408
so I can't show you evidence.

337
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:10,205
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

338
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:12,332
and she wanted to move on.

339
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:14,416
We provide that possibility.

340
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:18,463
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.

341
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:21,091
We provide that possibility."

342
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,133
What the hell is that?

343
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:26,096
The nicest guy
she ever went out with.

344
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:28,138
Oww! Fuck!

345
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,600
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

346
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:32,642
It's okay.
It's all right.

347
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:35,355
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

348
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:41,153
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.

349
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:43,070
She's impulsive.

350
00:27:43,071 --> 00:27:46,616
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

351
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:52,537
A lark.

352
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:56,001
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

353
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:01,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

354
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:04,342
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

355
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:07,387
- Okay. I want it done.
- I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.

356
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:10,849
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

357
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:13,852
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

358
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:17,481
- And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
- Yes, of course.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.

359
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,196
Now, the, uh...

360
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,199
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

361
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:29,282
is to go home...

362
00:28:29,284 --> 00:28:34,706
and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.

363
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,042
Anything.

364
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:42,714
And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.

365
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:45,384
Okay?

366
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:50,514
So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,

367
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:55,560
books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,

368
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:58,271
journal entries.

369
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:00,189
We want to empty your home...

370
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,528
We want to empty your life
of Clementine.

371
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:09,074
And after the mapping is done, our technicians
will do the erasing in your home tonight.

372
00:29:09,157 --> 00:29:12,494
That way, when you awake
in the morning,

373
00:29:12,577 --> 00:29:16,998
you'll find yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...

374
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:19,543
a new life awaiting you.

375
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:26,049
Wake up, buddy!

376
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:33,014
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

377
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:36,226
You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.

378
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:40,897
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

379
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:44,651
Hello. I'm right here.

380
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:48,905
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything
we can... We can fit you in on the first of March.

381
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:52,451
Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a-and he...

382
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:56,788
All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like to come in this week?

383
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,292
- Mr. Barish.
- Um, he's really busy this afternoon.

384
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:04,296
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?

385
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:08,258
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

386
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:17,476
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

387
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:20,103
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

388
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:24,691
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

389
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:27,194
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

390
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:29,277
My name is Joel Barish,

391
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,825
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

392
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:38,955
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

393
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:41,541
Uh, I was...

394
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:45,420
living with this woman, Naomi,

395
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,048
uh, a couple years ago,

396
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:53,345
and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to
this party at the beach... I don't like parties.

397
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:56,681
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...

398
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:59,893
and I, uh, met Clementine.

399
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:02,979
I'm sorry.

400
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:05,982
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

401
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:09,653
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

402
00:31:09,694 --> 00:31:11,694
There's an emotional core...

403
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:13,696
to each of our memories,

404
00:31:13,698 --> 00:31:17,494
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

405
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:19,996
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

406
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,792
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

407
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,877
as in a dream upon waking.

408
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:29,256
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

409
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:32,342
Well, uh, technically speaking,

410
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:34,384
the procedure is brain damage,

411
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:37,222
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

412
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:39,305
Nothing you'll miss.

413
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,729
Comfortable?

414
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,399
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,
is actually creating a map of your brain.

415
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:49,818
Okay, let's get started.

416
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:53,613
If we want to get this procedure
underway tonight, we have some work to do.

417
00:31:53,697 --> 00:31:57,534
I want you to react to these
objects, Mr. Barish, if you will.

418
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:02,622
There's a good story
behind this one...

419
00:32:02,706 --> 00:32:05,625
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get
a much better emotional readout...

420
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:09,588
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

421
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:11,671
Just try to focus on the memories.

422
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:14,217
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

423
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:20,432
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. Very good.

424
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:23,769
- Here's another object.
- That's so...

425
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:26,438
Next item. Okay.

426
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:30,023
Potato head.

427
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:33,278
Next item. Okay.

428
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:38,241
Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.

429
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:41,620
- Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, will ya?
- Yeah.

430
00:32:41,703 --> 00:32:45,582
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?

431
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:47,624
- Uh, voltage looks fine.
- Really?

432
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:51,630
Well, I'm not wiping as
clean as I like here. I'm...

433
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:59,721
Well, uh, technically the procedure
is brain damage.

434
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:04,267
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.

435
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,688
Oh, there you are.
I...

436
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:18,115
Why am I... I don't
understand what I'm looking at.

437
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:20,992
Why am I standing here and...

438
00:33:21,076 --> 00:33:23,912
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.

439
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:26,081
Déjà vu.
This is so...

440
00:33:26,164 --> 00:33:29,084
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...

441
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,087
Underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

442
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,673
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

443
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:38,093
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.

444
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:41,138
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.

445
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:45,724
Very good.

446
00:33:45,726 --> 00:33:48,019
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

447
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:51,398
That way you won't be confused later
by their unexplainable presence in your home.

448
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:53,734
Ah, there we go.

449
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:55,317
- Patrick?
- Yeah?

450
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:57,988
- Patrick, can you check...
- Patrick?

451
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:01,491
- I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice.
- Patrick? Patrick?

452
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:05,495
- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.

453
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:09,374
- Does that help?
- Are you sure you set that thing up properly?

454
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,416
How's that? How are
you today, Mr. Barish?

455
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:13,503
There we are, Mr. Barish. That's better.

456
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:16,923
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.

457
00:34:17,007 --> 00:34:18,966
We're almost done now.

458
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:22,095
Mmm. Journal.
That would be invaluable.

459
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:26,266
"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.

460
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:28,894
Her name is Clementine,
and she's amazing."

461
00:34:28,977 --> 00:34:31,521
Whoa! Jesus!

462
00:34:31,563 --> 00:34:34,524
What? What? Come on! Careful! Step back!

463
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:36,566
Just take it easy.

464
00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:38,486
That's fine.

465
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:40,487
Let's not roach the guy.

466
00:34:43,784 --> 00:34:45,869
All right, you got that one.

467
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:49,748
- This place is sort of a dump, don't you think?
- It's an apartment, Patrick.

468
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,084
Patrick.

469
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:56,213
Well, not a dump, then,
but sorta plain. Uninspired.

470
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:58,757
And there's sort of
a stale smell.

471
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:03,387
Patrick, can we just please
get through this?

472
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:07,057
We got a very long night ahead
of us. Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

473
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,564
This is the last time I saw you.

474
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:31,788
It's 3:00.

475
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,378
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.

476
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:38,461
Were you driving drunk?

477
00:35:38,463 --> 00:35:40,716
It's pathetic.

478
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:43,009
I was a little tipsy.

479
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:45,093
Don't call me pathetic.

480
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:47,095
Well, it is pathetic.

481
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:50,016
It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.

482
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,019
- Maybe you did kill somebody. Should we
turn on the news and see?
- Oh, Christ!

483
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:56,398
- Should I check the grill to see if there's any
children or small animals?
- I didn't kill anybody!

484
00:35:56,481 --> 00:36:00,318
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.

485
00:36:00,402 --> 00:36:02,821
Well, what are you like?

486
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:04,904
- A wino?
- A wino?

487
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:07,826
Jesus, are you from the '50s
or something?

488
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:09,909
A wino?

489
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:12,164
Face it, Joely.

490
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:16,668
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you,

491
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:19,671
and in your little wormy brain...

492
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:23,759
you're trying to figure out,
did she fuck someone tonight?

493
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:27,343
No, see, Clem,

494
00:36:27,345 --> 00:36:29,973
I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

495
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:32,476
Isn't that how you get people
to like you?

496
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:45,697
I'm sorry. Okay?

497
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:48,617
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?

498
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:56,122
- Clem?
- Your keys.

499
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:59,044
- I won't need them anymore.
- I was just... I was just...

500
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:02,214
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.

501
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,931
Clem?

502
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:15,894
Got it.

503
00:37:15,977 --> 00:37:17,977
Mary's coming over tonight.

504
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,688
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

505
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:21,689
Just thought you'd wanna know.

506
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:24,694
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.

507
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:27,364
She likes you okay.

508
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:30,534
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.

509
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:33,120
- Do whatever you want.
- Did I tell you I have...

510
00:37:33,203 --> 00:37:35,203
Yeah.

511
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:42,546
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

512
00:37:42,587 --> 00:37:44,587
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

513
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:46,589
Yeah, the thing is,

514
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:49,511
our situation is...
is a little weird.

515
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:51,594
My girlfriend situation.

516
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,515
I'm sure it is.

517
00:37:54,516 --> 00:37:56,518
You gotta be...

518
00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:24,586
Clem, let me drive you home.

519
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:26,673
Get out of my face, faggot!

520
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,636
Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!

521
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,097
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

522
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,139
You did it to me first!

523
00:38:36,141 --> 00:38:40,145
I can't believe you did
this to me. Goddamn it.

524
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:43,148
Clem! Can you hear me?

525
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:45,817
By morning you'll be gone!

526
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:49,404
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

527
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:58,205
Is there something wrong with a girl
being attracted to me? Is that a problem?

528
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,791
No, I think it's... funny.

529
00:39:00,874 --> 00:39:03,960
So, who do you think's better-looking,
me or this guy?

530
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:06,044
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

531
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,632
Remember that girl
we did last week?

532
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:11,843
The one with the... potatoes?

533
00:39:13,553 --> 00:39:17,015
- That girl?
- Yeah, that's this guy's girl.

534
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:19,057
- Right.
- Yeah.

535
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:22,020
Was. We took care of that.

536
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:24,564
- Oh, God!
- Well, uh...

537
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:27,526
I kinda fell in love with her
that night.

538
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,529
What? You little fuck...

539
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,573
- What?
- She was unconscious, man.

540
00:39:33,657 --> 00:39:36,660
Well, she was beautiful, and...

541
00:39:36,743 --> 00:39:39,746
I stole a pair of her panties as well.

542
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,666
- Jesus!
- What?

543
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:46,668
It's not like...
I mean, they were clean and all.

544
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,673
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

545
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:52,175
- They were clean!
- What? D-Don't! Stop!

546
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:54,678
- We got work to do.
- Okay. Yeah! All right!

547
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,722
Give me my papers.

548
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:12,612
There's, um...

549
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:15,991
There's more.

550
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,078
After we did her, I kind of...

551
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:23,582
went to where she works
and asked her out.

552
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,043
You what?

553
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:29,671
- Jesus.
- Jesus, Patrick!

554
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:33,717
Do you have... any idea...

555
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,676
how unethical...

556
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:38,597
It's not really that bad.

557
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,391
What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

558
00:40:41,475 --> 00:40:44,770
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!

559
00:40:56,114 --> 00:40:58,114
There's someone here.

560
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:01,117
He stole your underwear.

561
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,290
I don't see anyone.

562
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:23,850
Joel?

563
00:41:23,934 --> 00:41:26,311
Where are my boots?

564
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:44,287
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

565
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,918
Should've left you
at the flea market.

566
00:42:02,514 --> 00:42:04,683
Wanna go?

567
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,059
I want to have a baby.

568
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,981
Let's talk about it later.

569
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:14,192
No! I want to have a baby.

570
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,280
I don't think we're ready.

571
00:42:18,363 --> 00:42:20,365
You're not ready.

572
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:23,702
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

573
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,912
What?

574
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,875
I don't wanna
talk about it here.

575
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:32,711
I can't hear you. I can never the
fuck understand what you're saying.

576
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:35,213
- I'm saying I don't wanna talk about this!
- Fucking ventriloquist!

577
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,716
- We're fucking gonna talk about it!
- I... don't... want... to...

578
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:40,343
You can't just say something like that
and say you don't wanna talk about it!

579
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,388
- I'm sorry, Clem.
- I'd make a fucking good mother!

580
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,893
I love children, I'm creative and smart, and
I'd make a fucking great mother!

581
00:42:47,934 --> 00:42:51,313
It's you, Joel. It's you
who can't commit to anything!

582
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:55,067
- It's going! It's going!
- You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!

583
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,070
Maybe I should end it right here, Joel!

584
00:42:58,153 --> 00:43:01,531
- Leave you at the flea market with
this stupid costume jewelry!
- It's done. This is crap.

585
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:05,077
- Maybe you could find yourself an
antique rocking chair to die in!
- All the pain, confusion...

586
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,712
- Oh. Hi, Patrick.
- Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

587
00:43:15,754 --> 00:43:18,715
- Hey, you.
- Oh, it's freezing outside.

588
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:20,757
- Find us okay?
- Yeah.

589
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,473
- Mmm.
- Hot!

590
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:29,682
Poor guy.

591
00:43:29,684 --> 00:43:32,396
Mmm? Oh.

592
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,731
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

593
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:37,734
Uh, we haven't really
checked yet.

594
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:39,776
- Patrick?
- Uh, yeah.

595
00:43:39,778 --> 00:43:42,197
Uh, let me do the honors.

596
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,490
Mary hates me.

597
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:48,161
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

598
00:43:48,245 --> 00:43:50,245
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

599
00:43:50,247 --> 00:43:53,250
Stan. Stan.

600
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:54,834
- There's more.
- No!

601
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:56,210
- Yes.
- No!

602
00:43:56,211 --> 00:44:00,132
Hey, hey!

603
00:44:00,173 --> 00:44:03,135
Oh, you didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

604
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:05,762
- Uh, no, that's okay.
- Wait.

605
00:44:05,846 --> 00:44:10,142
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they
get the better, even of their blunders."

606
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:24,448
That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.

607
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:26,783
I found it in my Bartlett's.

608
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:28,825
What's your Bartlett's?

609
00:44:28,827 --> 00:44:30,827
It's a quote book, Patrick.

610
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:32,788
It's a book of quotations.

611
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:35,292
I think Howard will be
in Bartlett's one day.

612
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,333
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

613
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:39,713
God!

614
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:42,340
Can you wake him up?

615
00:44:42,424 --> 00:44:44,424
You can't wake him up.

616
00:44:47,596 --> 00:44:49,598
Mmm.

617
00:44:53,935 --> 00:44:55,937
You don't tell me things, Joel.

618
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:59,481
I'm an open book.

619
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,650
I tell you everything.

620
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:05,864
Every damn embarrassing thing.

621
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:10,577
You don't trust me.

622
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,164
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

623
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,627
I don't do that.

624
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:23,090
I want to know you.

625
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:26,257
Hmm?

626
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:29,304
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!

627
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:33,350
People have to
share things, Joel.

628
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:35,392
Mm-hmm.

629
00:45:35,394 --> 00:45:37,521
That's what intimacy is.

630
00:45:37,562 --> 00:45:40,524
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

631
00:45:40,565 --> 00:45:42,565
I'm sorry.

632
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:45,570
It just... really just
isn't that interesting.

633
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,741
I wanna read some of those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.

634
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:52,953
What do you write in there if you don't
have any thoughts or passions or...

635
00:45:53,036 --> 00:45:55,038
love?

636
00:46:01,837 --> 00:46:06,883
November 19, 2003.

637
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,636
Dinner at Kang's again.

638
00:46:12,055 --> 00:46:14,975
Are we like those poor couples...

639
00:46:15,058 --> 00:46:17,769
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

640
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:20,230
Are we the dining dead?

641
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:24,985
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

642
00:46:28,947 --> 00:46:31,408
I like that.

643
00:46:32,743 --> 00:46:34,743
How's the chicken?

644
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:36,747
Good.

645
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:41,126
- More?
- No. No. Thank you.

646
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:46,590
She's gonna be drunk
and stupid now.

647
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:49,092
Hey, would you
do me a favor...

648
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:52,137
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

649
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:54,179
- Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
- It's really...

650
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:56,266
- Gross.
- Gross.

651
00:46:58,602 --> 00:47:01,104
- It's just...
- Repulsive.

652
00:47:01,146 --> 00:47:03,146
It's repulsive.

653
00:47:08,612 --> 00:47:11,281
Patrick, can we get through this?

654
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:13,157
Patrick.

655
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:15,158
Hey, Tangerine.

656
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,288
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

657
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:20,665
I'm so miserable right now.

658
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:23,126
- Why? What's wrong?
- I don't know.

659
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:25,168
- Excuse me?
- I'm so confused!

660
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,170
Can I help you find something, sir?

661
00:47:27,172 --> 00:47:30,175
Confused? What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.

662
00:47:31,176 --> 00:47:33,176
Baby, come here.

663
00:47:33,178 --> 00:47:35,180
Scared of what?

664
00:47:36,178 --> 00:47:38,180
I don't know.

665
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:42,312
- Do you love me?
- Of course I do.

666
00:47:42,354 --> 00:47:44,354
Where's the self-help section?

667
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:46,858
Do you think I'm ugly?

668
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,361
No! You're beautiful!

669
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:51,696
- Maybe I should come over.
- No, no.

670
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:54,699
I don't know.
I-I'm a mess, Patrick.

671
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:57,452
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

672
00:47:57,536 --> 00:47:59,453
Okay.

673
00:47:59,454 --> 00:48:02,666
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

674
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:04,918
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

675
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:07,001
Let him go, Stan!

676
00:48:07,003 --> 00:48:09,923
Let him go. I'll help.

677
00:48:10,006 --> 00:48:12,006
- See?
- How hard can it be?

678
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:15,679
- She hates me. She wants me to go.
- Go.

679
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:18,682
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

680
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:20,516
You like?

681
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:23,562
Oh, man!

682
00:48:23,645 --> 00:48:25,645
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

683
00:48:25,689 --> 00:48:27,689
- I like it.
- You do?

684
00:48:27,691 --> 00:48:29,901
You look like a tangerine.

685
00:48:29,985 --> 00:48:33,447
- "Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
- Mmm! Juicy!

686
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,032
- And seedless.
- I like that.

687
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:39,911
I like tangerines!

688
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:42,122
Can you see me doing ducks?

689
00:48:42,205 --> 00:48:45,083
- Tangerine.
- Joel. Ducks. Quack-quack.

690
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:48,086
- How does he know to call you that?
- How did who know?

691
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,922
- Oh, my God. Clem?
- This is pretty cool.

692
00:48:51,006 --> 00:48:53,006
That's what they called themselves.

693
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:55,427
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.

694
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,510
They called themselves that
for a reason.

695
00:48:57,512 --> 00:49:00,891
It's amazing, isn't it? Like social
justice... Yeah, it's totally incredible.

696
00:49:00,932 --> 00:49:03,477
What Howard gives to the world.

697
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:06,563
Yeah.

698
00:49:06,646 --> 00:49:09,107
To let people begin again.

699
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:13,151
It's beautiful.

700
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:18,116
You look at a baby, and it's so
pure and so free and so clean.

701
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:21,620
And adults are, like,
this mess of sadness...

702
00:49:21,661 --> 00:49:24,456
and... phobias.

703
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:27,584
Howard just makes it all go away.

704
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:39,471
Oh, my God.

705
00:49:41,264 --> 00:49:44,184
- Baby, what's going on?
- I don't know. I don't know!

706
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:46,645
I'm lost, I'm scared,

707
00:49:46,728 --> 00:49:48,728
I feel like I'm disappearing.

708
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,650
- Disappearing?
- My skin's coming off! I'm getting old!

709
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:54,653
- Nothing makes any sense to me!
- You're not getting old.

710
00:49:54,736 --> 00:49:57,948
- Nothing makes any sense.
- Ohh, Tangerine.

711
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:00,325
Nothing makes any sense.

712
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:04,037
- Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
- It's okay. It's okay.

713
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:08,125
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

714
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,208
- Montauk?
- Yeah.

715
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:13,922
- No! Come up to Boston with me.
- Sure. Yeah. We can go next weekend.

716
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:17,217
No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

717
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,720
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

718
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:25,726
Hi, it's Joel.

719
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:30,981
Um, leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.

720
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:35,527
Pick up! Pick up, man!

721
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:38,363
W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

722
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:42,868
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

723
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,038
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

724
00:50:46,121 --> 00:50:48,874
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.

725
00:50:48,957 --> 00:50:51,877
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.

726
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,505
- He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
- Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

727
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:58,341
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

728
00:51:00,218 --> 00:51:02,218
Charles.

729
00:51:04,347 --> 00:51:06,349
Come on, Charles.

730
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:15,275
"Look! You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.

731
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,529
I'm just happy. I've never felt that
before. I'm just exactly where I want..."

732
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:24,201
- I'm so excited. Yey.
- I'm excited too!

733
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:28,121
- Cool.
- Oh, uh, I, uh...

734
00:51:28,205 --> 00:51:31,083
I got you this...

735
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:34,211
- What?
- Thing, um...

736
00:51:34,252 --> 00:51:36,252
Happy early Valentine's Day.

737
00:51:36,254 --> 00:51:38,256
Oh!

738
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:41,718
Wow. What is it?

739
00:51:41,802 --> 00:51:44,304
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.

740
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:51,851
Oh.

741
00:51:51,853 --> 00:51:53,853
It... It's gorgeous!

742
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:56,775
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

743
00:51:56,858 --> 00:52:01,238
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

744
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:03,281
Thank you.

745
00:52:10,288 --> 00:52:12,288
- Let's go.
- Okay.

746
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:15,585
- Joely?
- Yeah, Tangerine?

747
00:52:17,212 --> 00:52:19,756
Am I ugly?

748
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:23,260
- Mm-mmm.
- When I was a kid, I thought I was.

749
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:27,431
Can't believe I'm crying already.

750
00:52:27,472 --> 00:52:33,311
Sometimes I think people don't
understand how lonely it is to be a kid.

751
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:36,440
Like you don't matter.

752
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:39,818
So, I'm eight...

753
00:52:39,901 --> 00:52:42,154
and I have these toys,

754
00:52:42,237 --> 00:52:44,237
these dolls.

755
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,952
My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

756
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:51,036
And I keep yelling at her:

757
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:55,375
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

758
00:52:55,459 --> 00:52:57,461
It's weird.

759
00:52:57,544 --> 00:53:00,589
Like if I can transform her,

760
00:53:00,672 --> 00:53:03,300
I would magically change too.

761
00:53:08,013 --> 00:53:10,013
You're pretty.

762
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,185
Joely, don't ever leave me.

763
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:17,314
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

764
00:53:17,355 --> 00:53:21,318
Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.

765
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,359
Just this one.

766
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:26,323
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.

767
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:30,158
Stop it!

768
00:53:33,538 --> 00:53:36,166
I could die right now, Clem.

769
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,419
I'm just...

770
00:53:41,213 --> 00:53:43,382
happy.

771
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,969
I've never felt that before.

772
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:51,096
Mmm.

773
00:53:51,098 --> 00:53:53,100
I'm just exactly...

774
00:53:55,352 --> 00:53:57,354
where I wanna be.

775
00:53:58,397 --> 00:54:00,399
Clem?

776
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:09,116
I wanna call it off.

777
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:11,201
I'll give you a sign.

778
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:17,541
I wanna call it off!

779
00:54:19,918 --> 00:54:22,879
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!

780
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:25,298
I wanna call it off!

781
00:54:25,382 --> 00:54:29,219
When you ain't got nothing to do

782
00:54:29,261 --> 00:54:31,263
I think I'll marry you

783
00:54:31,346 --> 00:54:35,100
Is anybody there?

784
00:54:41,523 --> 00:54:44,025
- Clementine?
- Joel?

785
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:46,319
- Clement...
- Joely?

786
00:54:46,403 --> 00:54:48,488
- Clem!
- Joel?

787
00:54:48,572 --> 00:54:51,366
Clem!

788
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,660
What? We gotta go. We gotta go.

789
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:56,163
What? Where? I have an
idea of how to stop this.

790
00:54:56,246 --> 00:54:58,582
Stop what?

791
00:54:58,623 --> 00:55:00,623
- Joely.
- Come on, Clem.

792
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:03,962
- Smell my armpit! Smell my armpit!
- No!

793
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:06,590
- Don't tickle me! Don't make me smell you.
- Smell my pits!

794
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:08,631
- No.
- Good.

795
00:55:08,633 --> 00:55:11,011
Concentrate, Clem.

796
00:55:11,094 --> 00:55:13,597
We gotta get back
to the office.

797
00:55:13,638 --> 00:55:16,183
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.

798
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:18,268
Not the picture.

799
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:21,438
Where is it? Back here.
Come on!

800
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,149
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.

801
00:55:24,232 --> 00:55:27,944
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

802
00:55:27,986 --> 00:55:29,986
so I can't show you evidence.

803
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:33,408
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski...

804
00:55:33,492 --> 00:55:37,329
was not happy
and she wanted to move on.

805
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:41,958
- Good. Now, tell me about Clementine.
- Just tell me everything you remember.

806
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,878
- That's what he said. Then...
- What did we see that day?

807
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:46,961
- No, wait.
- Oh, look! Hey!

808
00:55:46,963 --> 00:55:49,466
- Shit!
- We're going to see my grandma.

809
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:52,219
- Joel, why...
- No, I don't want to...
We're not going on a train.

810
00:55:52,302 --> 00:55:55,055
- Don't make me run anymore.
- Come on!

811
00:55:55,138 --> 00:55:57,474
Mierzwiak!

812
00:55:57,516 --> 00:56:00,519
- Do we always have to run?
- Mierzwiak!

813
00:56:09,861 --> 00:56:11,861
Please.

814
00:56:11,863 --> 00:56:15,242
So, why don't we begin
by you telling me...

815
00:56:15,325 --> 00:56:17,411
everything you can remember.

816
00:56:17,494 --> 00:56:19,996
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

817
00:56:20,038 --> 00:56:23,083
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

818
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:26,169
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

819
00:56:26,211 --> 00:56:29,381
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

820
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:32,384
You're erasing me from her...

821
00:56:34,928 --> 00:56:36,928
I don't know.

822
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:40,600
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

823
00:56:40,684 --> 00:56:42,684
I'm in my brain.

824
00:56:42,686 --> 00:56:45,564
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.

825
00:56:45,647 --> 00:56:48,275
How can I help you
from there?

826
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:51,862
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.

827
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:55,532
Sorry.

828
00:56:55,615 --> 00:56:57,701
Look. Who's that?

829
00:56:57,743 --> 00:56:59,828
Oh, he-he works for us.

830
00:56:59,911 --> 00:57:04,541
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

831
00:57:04,624 --> 00:57:07,210
baby boy.

832
00:57:07,294 --> 00:57:09,796
He's stealing my identity.

833
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,257
He stole my stuff.

834
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,053
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

835
00:57:16,094 --> 00:57:19,306
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

836
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:21,389
He stole her underwear.

837
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:24,770
I could die right now, Clem.

838
00:57:24,853 --> 00:57:27,314
I'm just happy.

839
00:57:27,397 --> 00:57:31,985
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want to be.

840
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:35,530
I want to go home.

841
00:57:36,615 --> 00:57:38,615
Hey. What?

842
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:44,623
Clem!

843
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:46,708
Wait. Clem!

844
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:49,961
Clem?

845
00:57:50,045 --> 00:57:52,506
They're erasing you.

846
00:57:52,589 --> 00:57:54,589
I'm here!

847
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:57,260
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?

848
00:57:57,302 --> 00:57:59,302
I'm so stupid.

849
00:57:59,304 --> 00:58:02,349
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

850
00:58:02,432 --> 00:58:05,769
I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.

851
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:11,608
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

852
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:14,945
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

853
00:58:14,986 --> 00:58:16,821
Wake yourself up!

854
00:58:16,822 --> 00:58:19,616
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

855
00:58:19,658 --> 00:58:22,577
Okay, here we go. Will this make
you happy if I tried?

856
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:25,664
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

857
00:58:25,747 --> 00:58:27,874
Yeah. Okay.

858
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:31,169
Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.

859
00:58:31,253 --> 00:58:33,797
Don't! That tickles me!
Oh, my goodness.

860
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,299
Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the...

861
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:38,341
It's a birthmark!

862
00:58:41,596 --> 00:58:44,850
It did work, for a second,

863
00:58:44,933 --> 00:58:47,477
but I couldn't... I couldn't move. See?

864
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:52,190
Oh, well, isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

865
00:58:52,274 --> 00:58:54,609
It's more important to prove
me wrong than to actually...

866
00:58:54,693 --> 00:58:57,821
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

867
00:58:57,904 --> 00:59:01,241
Fine.

868
00:59:01,324 --> 00:59:04,327
Then what? I'm listening.

869
00:59:04,369 --> 00:59:07,080
I don't know.
You erased me.

870
00:59:07,164 --> 00:59:09,833
That's why I'm here. That's why
I'm doing this in the first place.

871
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:11,875
- I'm sorry.
- You... You!

872
00:59:11,877 --> 00:59:14,337
You know me. I'm impulsive.

873
00:59:17,632 --> 00:59:19,718
That's what I love about you.

874
00:59:23,513 --> 00:59:25,097
Joel?

875
00:59:25,098 --> 00:59:28,060
Mm-hmm? I have another
idea for this problem.

876
00:59:28,143 --> 00:59:30,395
This is a memory of me,

877
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:35,192
the way you wanted to have sex on the
couch after you looked down at my crotch.

878
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:38,195
What? Joel, the eraser
guys are coming here,

879
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:41,239
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

880
00:59:41,323 --> 00:59:43,492
somewhere where I don't belong,

881
00:59:43,575 --> 00:59:46,119
and we hide there till morning?

882
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,919
Oh, man. I can't remember
anything without you.

883
00:59:54,002 --> 00:59:57,172
That's very sweet,
but try, okay?

884
00:59:57,255 --> 00:59:59,255
Okay.

885
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:04,554
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

886
01:00:04,596 --> 01:00:06,848
Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily

887
01:00:06,932 --> 01:00:10,560
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

888
01:00:10,602 --> 01:00:13,563
- Row, row, row your boat
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

889
01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:17,275
- Life is but a dream
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

890
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:20,153
Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily

891
01:00:20,237 --> 01:00:23,448
- Life is but a dream
- Row, row, row your boat

892
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:25,575
- It's working!
- Row, row, row your boat

893
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:29,246
- Gently down the stream
- I'm a genius!

894
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:51,725
Joel?

895
01:00:51,727 --> 01:00:53,937
Joel?

896
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:57,816
Where'd you go?

897
01:00:57,899 --> 01:00:59,775
I'm supposed to come too!

898
01:00:59,776 --> 01:01:03,280
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?

899
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:05,363
- Sure.
- He just likes to be near me.

900
01:01:05,365 --> 01:01:07,365
- Absolutely!
- Clem?

901
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:11,580
It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!

902
01:01:11,663 --> 01:01:15,792
It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!

903
01:01:15,876 --> 01:01:20,464
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

904
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:22,924
Who am I?

905
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:24,967
- Mrs. Hamlyn.
- Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

906
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:27,512
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

907
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:30,891
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

908
01:01:30,974 --> 01:01:33,477
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

909
01:01:33,518 --> 01:01:37,230
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

910
01:01:37,314 --> 01:01:40,358
- Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?
- No, not at all.

911
01:01:40,442 --> 01:01:42,986
Oh, my God. I love this kitchen.

912
01:01:43,028 --> 01:01:46,031
- Thank you so much.
- She's not looking at me.

913
01:01:46,114 --> 01:01:49,242
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.

914
01:01:49,326 --> 01:01:52,662
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

915
01:01:52,704 --> 01:01:55,707
Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!

916
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:58,335
- Is that little peanut under there okay?
- Mm-hmm! He's fine.

917
01:01:58,377 --> 01:02:00,712
Do you have something to drink?

918
01:02:00,796 --> 01:02:03,465
Would you drink a cocktail at this
hour? I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

919
01:02:03,548 --> 01:02:06,009
- I would die for a vodka.
- Oh, hang on. Let me check if I have that.

920
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:08,845
Okay! I'm just gonna wait right
here. Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

921
01:02:08,887 --> 01:02:10,887
Uh, Joely.

922
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:14,518
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.

923
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:18,980
- Ice cream.
- No, not until after you've had your dinner.

924
01:02:19,064 --> 01:02:21,066
Come on, Joel!

925
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:23,149
Joel, grow up!

926
01:02:23,151 --> 01:02:25,529
Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.

927
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:28,031
- This is sort of warped.
- I'm scared.

928
01:02:28,073 --> 01:02:31,368
- I want my mommy!
- Don't cry, baby Joel.

929
01:02:31,451 --> 01:02:35,747
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

930
01:02:35,831 --> 01:02:38,625
Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!

931
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:41,545
Hey, honey, look.

932
01:02:41,586 --> 01:02:43,588
Wait there.

933
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:49,720
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

934
01:02:49,761 --> 01:02:51,761
Yuck.

935
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:57,894
It stopped.

936
01:02:57,936 --> 01:03:01,690
- What?
- It stopped erasing.

937
01:03:01,773 --> 01:03:04,192
Oh, shit.

938
01:03:04,276 --> 01:03:06,276
This is terrible.

939
01:03:07,779 --> 01:03:10,115
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

940
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:13,744
Where? I don't know where! What
do you mean? I don't know where!

941
01:03:13,785 --> 01:03:17,914
This is bad. This is very, very
bad news. Where are my glasses?

942
01:03:17,956 --> 01:03:20,542
Okay. Crap.

943
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,378
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

944
01:03:23,462 --> 01:03:26,006
What shall we do? I don't know
what to do. I don't know what to do.

945
01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:28,300
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

946
01:03:28,383 --> 01:03:31,011
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What do we do?

947
01:03:31,094 --> 01:03:34,681
I don't know. Now, look, you're
freaking me out. Mellow out.

948
01:03:34,765 --> 01:03:38,602
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

949
01:03:38,643 --> 01:03:41,688
Quiet. You're freaking me out.
Shh. Shh.

950
01:03:41,772 --> 01:03:44,775
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.

951
01:03:44,816 --> 01:03:46,816
- Oh, shit!
- I'm hungry.

952
01:03:46,818 --> 01:03:48,818
- Oh, shit.
- Oh! Oh!

953
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,323
What? Oh! What, what?
What?

954
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:54,326
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

955
01:03:54,368 --> 01:03:56,536
This is my...
I can handle this.

956
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:58,914
- I can't call Howard.
- He's an unbaked cookie.

957
01:03:58,997 --> 01:04:01,666
He's... There's no time
to fuck around.

958
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,252
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?

959
01:04:04,336 --> 01:04:07,172
- Stop fucking around!
- Okay, I'll call Howard.

960
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:18,308
- Hello.
- Hello, Howard? Hey, it's Stan.

961
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:22,187
Um, I'm working on this guy down here,
and we seem to have lost him for a moment,

962
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:25,023
and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.

963
01:04:25,107 --> 01:04:28,527
Okay, uh, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

964
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:32,030
Well, I wasn't sure, really, 'cause I
was away from the monitor for a minute...

965
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:34,783
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh...

966
01:04:34,866 --> 01:04:36,866
I had to pee.

967
01:04:36,868 --> 01:04:40,539
- Where's Patrick?
- Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick.

968
01:04:40,622 --> 01:04:42,622
Ah, Jesus.

969
01:04:42,624 --> 01:04:45,377
- Okay, what's the address?
- I know. I'm so sorry.

970
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,172
- That's okay. Come on.
- I'm at 159 South Village.

971
01:04:49,214 --> 01:04:52,384
- Yeah.
- Apartment 1E. Rockville Center.

972
01:04:52,467 --> 01:04:55,137
Mary, he's coming right now.

973
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,220
I'm staying.

974
01:04:57,222 --> 01:04:59,558
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.

975
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:02,144
- I think you should go.
- Hell, no.

976
01:05:02,227 --> 01:05:05,814
Mary... Shit.

977
01:05:05,897 --> 01:05:09,860
- I am so stoned.
- Please, Mary.

978
01:05:09,943 --> 01:05:12,320
- You have to go.
- Stop being stoned, Mary.

979
01:05:12,404 --> 01:05:15,198
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

980
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,411
- Mary, you have no idea how much trouble we're
gonna get into if Howard comes...
- I look like shit!

981
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:22,706
Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!

982
01:05:28,587 --> 01:05:30,589
- Joel!
- I want her to pick me up.

983
01:05:30,672 --> 01:05:34,217
- It's weird how strong that desire is.
- Joel, look at me! Look.

984
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:36,595
You'll remember me in the morning,

985
01:05:36,678 --> 01:05:39,848
and you'll come to me, and you'll
tell me about us, and we'll start over.

986
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:42,267
Pat? I just... Pat?

987
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:44,519
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

988
01:05:44,603 --> 01:05:47,064
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.

989
01:05:47,105 --> 01:05:49,107
What Patrick guy?

990
01:05:49,191 --> 01:05:51,025
- That guy!
- What?

991
01:05:51,026 --> 01:05:52,943
He's here in my apartment.

992
01:05:52,944 --> 01:05:54,944
He's one of those eraser guys.

993
01:05:54,946 --> 01:05:59,284
He fell for you when they were doing you, and now
he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you,

994
01:05:59,368 --> 01:06:01,703
and you guys are dating.

995
01:06:01,787 --> 01:06:04,998
Really? Is he cute?

996
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:09,795
Clem,
there's nothing wrong with you.

997
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:12,464
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

998
01:06:12,547 --> 01:06:15,467
You... You're kind,

999
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,761
Beautiful...

1000
01:06:17,844 --> 01:06:20,097
and smart and funny...

1001
01:06:20,138 --> 01:06:22,391
and... nice.

1002
01:06:22,474 --> 01:06:24,684
What?

1003
01:06:25,936 --> 01:06:28,355
Okay. All right.

1004
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:32,192
Okay. Oh!

1005
01:06:32,275 --> 01:06:34,569
- Move, move, move! Come on. Let's go.
- Careful, careful.

1006
01:06:34,653 --> 01:06:36,487
Fine.

1007
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:39,908
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1008
01:06:39,991 --> 01:06:42,369
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

1009
01:06:47,124 --> 01:06:49,124
Be cool. Cool.

1010
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,924
- Hello, Mary. What are you doing here?
- Oh, hi, Howard.

1011
01:06:56,007 --> 01:06:58,007
She was just here to help out.

1012
01:06:58,009 --> 01:07:01,138
I wanted to understand as much as I
could about the procedure as possible.

1013
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:04,933
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings...

1014
01:07:05,016 --> 01:07:07,185
of the work that we do.

1015
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:09,980
Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...

1016
01:07:10,021 --> 01:07:13,734
by people... where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

1017
01:07:13,817 --> 01:07:16,820
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,

1018
01:07:16,903 --> 01:07:19,489
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

1019
01:07:19,531 --> 01:07:21,533
Uh, yeah. Um...

1020
01:07:24,286 --> 01:07:26,747
- Well, that's odd.
- I already tried that.

1021
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:30,584
- Did you try going through the C-gate?
- Yeah, of course.

1022
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:32,543
I mean... yes.

1023
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:34,755
Yeah.

1024
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:38,965
All right.

1025
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:42,427
- You want to get linked up?
- Yeah.

1026
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:44,723
All right.

1027
01:07:44,806 --> 01:07:47,434
I already... I ran
the utility programs,

1028
01:07:47,517 --> 01:07:49,519
and I had nothing there,

1029
01:07:49,561 --> 01:07:52,564
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1030
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:54,649
Here, Howard.

1031
01:07:54,733 --> 01:07:57,110
- I got you a chair. There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

1032
01:07:57,194 --> 01:07:59,738
You're welcome.

1033
01:07:59,821 --> 01:08:03,408
All right, I'm gonna... I'm gonna
go through the entire memory,

1034
01:08:03,492 --> 01:08:05,494
see if something comes up.

1035
01:08:05,577 --> 01:08:08,914
Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling

1036
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:12,167
Oh, my darling Clementine

1037
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,711
I love being bathed in the sink.

1038
01:08:14,795 --> 01:08:17,297
Such a feeling of security.

1039
01:08:17,381 --> 01:08:20,592
I've never seen you
happier, baby Joel.

1040
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:22,675
There it is.

1041
01:08:22,677 --> 01:08:27,015
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1042
01:08:27,099 --> 01:08:29,142
What the heck
was he doing there?

1043
01:08:38,735 --> 01:08:40,737
His eyes are open.

1044
01:08:42,614 --> 01:08:46,201
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.

1045
01:08:46,284 --> 01:08:49,830
Oh, this is...
this is not good. No.

1046
01:08:49,913 --> 01:08:52,124
I'm gonna have to...

1047
01:08:52,207 --> 01:08:54,207
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1048
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:21,194
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1049
01:09:21,278 --> 01:09:24,448
Okay, we're back in.

1050
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:28,744
Wow. That was beautiful
to watch, Howard.

1051
01:09:28,827 --> 01:09:32,831
Like a surgeon or a concert
pianist or something.

1052
01:09:32,914 --> 01:09:34,914
Thank you, Mary.

1053
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:39,004
Um, Howard, you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

1054
01:09:39,087 --> 01:09:43,633
Why can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1055
01:09:43,717 --> 01:09:45,719
Hmm. Lucky me.

1056
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:50,182
Lay one on me.

1057
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:53,477
Don't call me Antoine.

1058
01:09:53,518 --> 01:09:55,937
- My name is Wally.
- Yes, I know,

1059
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:58,565
but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

1060
01:09:58,648 --> 01:10:01,026
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1061
01:10:01,109 --> 01:10:03,820
Hey. My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.

1062
01:10:03,862 --> 01:10:06,364
There is?

1063
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:09,993
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

1064
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:13,080
- What, Joel... What are you doing?
- We gotta go.

1065
01:10:13,163 --> 01:10:15,832
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!

1066
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,628
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1067
01:10:20,629 --> 01:10:22,629
Clem, come on!

1068
01:10:23,465 --> 01:10:25,465
There I am.

1069
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:27,467
That truck.

1070
01:10:27,469 --> 01:10:30,389
Doc? Please.

1071
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:34,559
All right, let's begin
by you telling me...

1072
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:37,396
everything you remember...

1073
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:41,400
That's strange. He's in a
memory that we've already erased.

1074
01:10:41,441 --> 01:10:45,529
Oh, well, at least we know where
he is. He's back on track, right?

1075
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,570
Come on, Clem.

1076
01:10:47,572 --> 01:10:50,617
He seems to have developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.

1077
01:10:50,701 --> 01:10:53,286
- I don't want to run anymore.
- Shit.

1078
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:58,875
Come on, come on. Hide me somewhere
deeper, somewhere really buried.

1079
01:10:58,959 --> 01:11:01,712
- Where?
- Hide me in your humiliation.

1080
01:11:02,879 --> 01:11:05,465
- Humiliation.
- Come on, you big baby!

1081
01:11:05,549 --> 01:11:07,549
I'm sorry, okay?

1082
01:11:11,012 --> 01:11:13,849
Let me drive you home.

1083
01:11:13,932 --> 01:11:16,351
No!

1084
01:11:16,435 --> 01:11:19,855
- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait. Howard.

1085
01:11:19,938 --> 01:11:22,232
He's disappeared again.

1086
01:11:22,274 --> 01:11:26,486
- Oh, dear.
- I'm so sorry, Howard.

1087
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:28,572
Humiliation.

1088
01:11:28,613 --> 01:11:31,241
Humiliation.

1089
01:11:31,324 --> 01:11:34,327
- Hu-mi-lia...
- Joel.

1090
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:36,580
I don't like it either.

1091
01:11:36,621 --> 01:11:39,166
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to...

1092
01:11:39,249 --> 01:11:42,210
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just... Oh, um...

1093
01:11:42,294 --> 01:11:45,130
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

1094
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:48,008
Good night, sweetheart.

1095
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:50,427
No.

1096
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:53,472
- I'm sorry, Joel. Joely.
- Shut up.

1097
01:11:54,723 --> 01:11:57,601
Look! Joel!

1098
01:11:57,642 --> 01:11:59,642
- Joel, look!
- What?

1099
01:11:59,644 --> 01:12:01,644
Look where we are!

1100
01:12:01,646 --> 01:12:04,107
Oh, no.

1101
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:06,610
Clem, this isn't good.

1102
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:10,530
Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.

1103
01:12:13,325 --> 01:12:16,036
- Hit it! Hit it!
- I can't! I gotta go home.

1104
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:18,497
I'll do it later!

1105
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:25,170
Come on, you big sissy!

1106
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:35,722
Ooh!

1107
01:12:35,806 --> 01:12:38,892
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!

1108
01:12:38,975 --> 01:12:41,645
- Wait. What am I doing? You know something, Freddy?
- And he loves her!

1109
01:12:41,686 --> 01:12:43,897
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow! Ow!

1110
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,982
Joel!

1111
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:48,860
- Joely, get up. Come on, it's not worth it.
- Hit him! Hit him!

1112
01:12:48,944 --> 01:12:53,490
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

1113
01:12:53,573 --> 01:12:55,659
- Come on, Joel.
- Stupid!

1114
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:05,627
- I'm so ashamed.
- It's okay.

1115
01:13:05,711 --> 01:13:07,963
- You were a little kid.
- Yeah?

1116
01:13:08,046 --> 01:13:10,674
- Come on.
- That's where I live... lived.

1117
01:13:10,716 --> 01:13:13,009
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.

1118
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:16,763
Do you like my pink hat? Here, look, feel
better. You can really kill me this time.

1119
01:13:16,847 --> 01:13:19,474
- It's my turn. Go. One, two, three.
- I can? You're really gonna die though.

1120
01:13:19,558 --> 01:13:21,768
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

1121
01:13:21,852 --> 01:13:24,312
You're dead.

1122
01:13:24,396 --> 01:13:27,691
Oh, my mom.
It's... It's okay. We're playing.

1123
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:30,444
- Hi, Joel's mom. He's killing me.
- It's not real.

1124
01:13:30,527 --> 01:13:32,738
Okay, are you dead yet?

1125
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:34,948
You're dead!

1126
01:13:35,031 --> 01:13:37,031
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.

1127
01:13:37,034 --> 01:13:40,245
I still don't understand it,
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1128
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:57,637
Clem!

1129
01:13:58,638 --> 01:14:00,932
Clem!

1130
01:14:15,947 --> 01:14:17,947
Jo... Joely?

1131
01:14:17,949 --> 01:14:20,077
Are you okay, Joel?

1132
01:14:20,118 --> 01:14:22,412
Joel? Joel?

1133
01:14:22,454 --> 01:14:25,332
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.

1134
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:27,415
- Okay, okay.
- That was like three seconds.

1135
01:14:27,417 --> 01:14:31,296
- All right. Let me do it one more time.
- One more, then I get to go.

1136
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,299
Okay.

1137
01:14:44,309 --> 01:14:46,603
- Look at this.
- This is so cool!

1138
01:14:46,686 --> 01:14:48,855
Cool. Look out! Look out!

1139
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:53,983
- Shit!
- It's fluff.

1140
01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:57,531
Our house!

1141
01:14:58,824 --> 01:15:01,034
Come on. Whoo-hoo!
Come on.

1142
01:15:01,118 --> 01:15:03,118
Come on.
We gotta go!

1143
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,706
Whoo!

1144
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:07,791
Come on!

1145
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:10,834
We gotta go. Clem?

1146
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:13,714
We gotta go.

1147
01:15:13,797 --> 01:15:15,756
Aah! Come on!

1148
01:15:15,757 --> 01:15:17,968
No! This is a really bad time for this!

1149
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:20,971
Get off me! Oh, God!

1150
01:15:21,012 --> 01:15:23,974
- I don't even know where we're going.
- It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1151
01:15:24,015 --> 01:15:26,560
- It's the best place. No, this way.
- No, this way.

1152
01:15:26,643 --> 01:15:31,273
No, no, no. This way.
You're no help at all.

1153
01:15:31,356 --> 01:15:34,067
What's wrong with you?

1154
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:37,320
Let go of me, Joel!

1155
01:15:49,332 --> 01:15:51,332
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1156
01:15:55,047 --> 01:15:57,549
I guess, uh...

1157
01:15:57,632 --> 01:16:00,427
I guess I'll go out
for... for some air,

1158
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:02,512
if nobody minds.

1159
01:16:02,554 --> 01:16:05,766
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

1160
01:16:05,849 --> 01:16:07,849
Yeah, that's, uh...

1161
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:09,851
that's fine.

1162
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:22,491
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1163
01:16:23,575 --> 01:16:25,575
What do you mean?

1164
01:16:25,577 --> 01:16:28,246
Oh, you know,
like famous quotes?

1165
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:30,499
I find reading them inspirational,

1166
01:16:30,582 --> 01:16:34,461
and in my reading, I've come across
some I thought you might like too.

1167
01:16:34,544 --> 01:16:38,215
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.

1168
01:16:38,256 --> 01:16:40,717
There's one that goes,

1169
01:16:40,759 --> 01:16:44,262
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they
get the better, even of their blunders."

1170
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:46,346
- That's Nietzsche, right?
- Yeah.

1171
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:49,351
And here I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.

1172
01:16:49,434 --> 01:16:52,562
Oh, no. It's... It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1173
01:16:52,604 --> 01:16:55,607
Yeah. Oh, and there's
this other one I like.

1174
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,527
It's by Pope Alexander,
and it goes...

1175
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:01,071
- Alexander Pope?
- Oh, yeah.

1176
01:17:01,113 --> 01:17:03,113
Yeah, shit.

1177
01:17:03,115 --> 01:17:06,952
It's just that I told myself not to say
"Pope Alexander" and sound like a dope,

1178
01:17:07,035 --> 01:17:09,037
and then I go ahead and say it.

1179
01:17:09,121 --> 01:17:12,624
- It's no big deal.
- You're such a sweetheart.

1180
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:18,422
The quote goes, "How happy is
the blameless vestal's lot?

1181
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:22,759
"The world forgetting,
by the world forgot.

1182
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:27,139
"Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind.

1183
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:30,767
Each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned."

1184
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:35,814
I want to be
a great big, huge elephant...

1185
01:17:35,897 --> 01:17:38,358
with a huge trunk like that.

1186
01:17:39,776 --> 01:17:42,696
Clem? Clementine?

1187
01:17:42,779 --> 01:17:45,741
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1188
01:17:45,824 --> 01:17:48,785
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

1189
01:17:53,457 --> 01:17:57,127
I really admire
the work you do, Howard.

1190
01:17:57,169 --> 01:17:59,671
- I don't mean to be so familiar.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

1191
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:02,299
I-I-I-I-I...
I'm happy to hear...

1192
01:18:06,053 --> 01:18:09,056
I'm sorry.

1193
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:15,437
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1194
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:21,026
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Oh, Mary, no.

1195
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:24,321
It's... You're a wonderful girl.

1196
01:18:24,404 --> 01:18:28,116
But I... You know,
I have a wife and kids.

1197
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,200
You know
I have a wife and kids.

1198
01:18:30,202 --> 01:18:32,202
Oh, Mary.

1199
01:18:34,247 --> 01:18:37,125
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1200
01:18:47,135 --> 01:18:49,137
Oh, whoa.

1201
01:18:53,558 --> 01:18:56,853
Well, good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1202
01:19:04,236 --> 01:19:06,238
What?
Oh, my God!

1203
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:08,865
Who is it?

1204
01:19:13,245 --> 01:19:15,622
Uh...

1205
01:19:21,294 --> 01:19:24,548
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1206
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:31,304
Hollis. Hollis!

1207
01:19:31,388 --> 01:19:33,807
Hollis!

1208
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:36,059
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.

1209
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:39,855
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out to be like this.

1210
01:19:39,938 --> 01:19:43,275
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1211
01:19:43,358 --> 01:19:45,819
- I'm a stupid girl with a stupid crush!
- Yeah.

1212
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:48,405
I swear I basically forced him into it!

1213
01:19:49,614 --> 01:19:52,242
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1214
01:19:54,911 --> 01:19:57,622
Tell me what?

1215
01:19:57,706 --> 01:19:59,708
Oh, you poor kid.

1216
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:02,794
You can have him.

1217
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:04,878
You did.

1218
01:20:13,305 --> 01:20:15,307
What?

1219
01:20:19,144 --> 01:20:21,144
Oh, uh,

1220
01:20:26,151 --> 01:20:29,738
we have a history.

1221
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:32,365
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1222
01:20:32,449 --> 01:20:34,618
You...

1223
01:20:34,659 --> 01:20:37,162
You wanted it done...

1224
01:20:37,245 --> 01:20:40,540
so you could get past, uh...

1225
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:44,252
You could... Yeah.

1226
01:20:45,712 --> 01:20:50,675
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

1227
01:20:50,759 --> 01:20:52,761
It's almost morning.

1228
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,972
We'll talk later.

1229
01:20:56,973 --> 01:20:58,973
Okay?

1230
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:11,861
Hey.

1231
01:21:15,742 --> 01:21:17,744
Let me give you a lift home.

1232
01:21:27,337 --> 01:21:29,881
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1233
01:21:29,965 --> 01:21:33,552
Hi.
Hi.

1234
01:21:33,635 --> 01:21:37,556
Didn't figure you'd show your face
around me again.

1235
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:40,851
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

1236
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:42,934
You did run away,
after all.

1237
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:45,731
I just needed to see ya.

1238
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:48,108
Yeah?

1239
01:21:48,191 --> 01:21:50,902
I'd like to, um,

1240
01:21:50,986 --> 01:21:53,947
take you out or something.

1241
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,575
You're married.

1242
01:21:56,658 --> 01:21:59,077
Not yet. Not married.

1243
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:01,161
No, I'm not married, no.

1244
01:22:01,163 --> 01:22:04,207
Look, man, I'm telling you right
off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1245
01:22:04,249 --> 01:22:08,837
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1246
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,214
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1247
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:14,426
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1248
01:22:14,509 --> 01:22:16,678
Okay.

1249
01:22:16,762 --> 01:22:19,639
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1250
01:22:19,723 --> 01:22:22,517
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1251
01:22:22,601 --> 01:22:26,229
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's
looking for my own peace of mind.

1252
01:22:26,271 --> 01:22:30,942
- Don't assign me yours.
- I remember that speech really well.

1253
01:22:31,026 --> 01:22:34,529
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.

1254
01:22:34,613 --> 01:22:36,613
Hmm. Probably.

1255
01:22:38,784 --> 01:22:41,078
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1256
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:43,119
even after that.

1257
01:22:43,121 --> 01:22:46,541
Mmm. I know.

1258
01:22:48,877 --> 01:22:50,879
It would be different...

1259
01:22:52,005 --> 01:22:54,424
if we could just give it
another go around.

1260
01:22:58,387 --> 01:23:00,764
Remember me.

1261
01:23:00,806 --> 01:23:02,808
Try your best.

1262
01:23:05,143 --> 01:23:07,143
Maybe we can.

1263
01:23:38,343 --> 01:23:41,304
Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,

1264
01:23:41,346 --> 01:23:43,974
and, uh, then we'll
take it from there.

1265
01:23:44,015 --> 01:23:46,268
Okay.

1266
01:23:46,351 --> 01:23:49,229
I liked you immediately.

1267
01:23:49,312 --> 01:23:51,815
You didn't
come on to me at all.

1268
01:23:51,857 --> 01:23:54,860
I liked that.

1269
01:23:54,943 --> 01:23:57,904
I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.

1270
01:23:57,988 --> 01:24:00,657
I wanted you to think
I was smart.

1271
01:24:01,867 --> 01:24:04,161
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1272
01:24:04,244 --> 01:24:07,748
I had these fantasies
of us being married...

1273
01:24:07,831 --> 01:24:11,168
and having kids and... just...

1274
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:13,962
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1275
01:24:14,046 --> 01:24:16,631
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

1276
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:19,176
Yeah, I know.

1277
01:24:19,217 --> 01:24:21,217
Oh, God.

1278
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:23,597
- I'll take the bottom and you...
- Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1279
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,680
- I can take that.
- So you want me to carry that?

1280
01:24:25,682 --> 01:24:28,143
- Help me with that. Can you get the cooler?
- Honey, the cooler is...

1281
01:24:28,226 --> 01:24:30,854
- That's light, huh? Oh, I can get that.
- You can get it.

1282
01:24:30,896 --> 01:24:32,896
No, no, no, no!

1283
01:24:32,898 --> 01:24:35,067
- Don't take anything.
- I can take the plane.

1284
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:38,153
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1285
01:24:40,405 --> 01:24:43,116
This is the day we met.

1286
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,370
You were down by the surf. I could
just make you out in the distance.

1287
01:24:46,453 --> 01:24:48,580
I remember being drawn to you
even then.

1288
01:24:48,663 --> 01:24:52,793
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."

1289
01:24:54,586 --> 01:24:57,714
You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...

1290
01:24:57,798 --> 01:24:59,798
and even hate, eventually.

1291
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:03,845
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1292
01:25:03,929 --> 01:25:06,640
Hi there.

1293
01:25:06,723 --> 01:25:08,723
Hi.

1294
01:25:08,725 --> 01:25:11,645
I saw you sitting over here...

1295
01:25:11,728 --> 01:25:13,728
by yourself,

1296
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:16,608
and I thought, "Thank God.

1297
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:19,486
Someone normal who doesn't know how
to interact at these things either."

1298
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:21,696
Yeah.

1299
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:24,783
I don't ever know what to say.

1300
01:25:24,866 --> 01:25:27,577
I'm Clementine.

1301
01:25:27,661 --> 01:25:30,831
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1302
01:25:30,914 --> 01:25:33,125
And then you just took it...

1303
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,711
without waiting for an answer.

1304
01:25:39,297 --> 01:25:41,758
It was so intimate,

1305
01:25:41,842 --> 01:25:44,970
like we were already lovers.

1306
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:47,848
I'm Joel.

1307
01:25:47,931 --> 01:25:50,100
Hi, Joel.

1308
01:25:50,142 --> 01:25:53,395
So, no jokes about my name.

1309
01:25:53,478 --> 01:25:57,941
You mean like... Oh, my darling, oh,
my darling Oh, my darling Clementine

1310
01:25:57,983 --> 01:26:00,485
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1311
01:26:00,569 --> 01:26:02,612
Yeah. Like that.

1312
01:26:02,654 --> 01:26:04,654
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1313
01:26:04,656 --> 01:26:08,410
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1314
01:26:08,493 --> 01:26:10,493
Oh.

1315
01:26:12,414 --> 01:26:14,750
I think your name is magical.

1316
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:19,963
This is it, Joel.

1317
01:26:20,005 --> 01:26:22,215
It's gonna be gone soon.

1318
01:26:24,342 --> 01:26:26,678
I know.

1319
01:26:26,762 --> 01:26:28,762
What do we do?

1320
01:26:31,099 --> 01:26:33,602
Enjoy it.

1321
01:26:50,243 --> 01:26:52,537
- You married?
- No.

1322
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:55,248
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1323
01:26:55,332 --> 01:26:57,291
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1324
01:26:57,292 --> 01:27:00,670
- Male or female?
- What?

1325
01:27:00,712 --> 01:27:03,173
Female. Female.

1326
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,804
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1327
01:27:11,556 --> 01:27:15,560
- You know these people?
- No, of course not. Come on.

1328
01:27:16,561 --> 01:27:18,561
They might have a dog.

1329
01:27:18,563 --> 01:27:22,234
There's no dog.

1330
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:24,319
What are you doing?

1331
01:27:24,403 --> 01:27:27,656
- It's freezing out.
- I can't believe this.

1332
01:27:27,739 --> 01:27:30,701
Hoo-hoo!

1333
01:27:30,742 --> 01:27:34,579
- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!

1334
01:27:41,336 --> 01:27:43,922
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1335
01:27:44,005 --> 01:27:47,134
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1336
01:27:49,886 --> 01:27:51,886
It's dark.

1337
01:27:51,888 --> 01:27:55,851
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1338
01:27:55,934 --> 01:27:59,187
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...

1339
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:01,648
- We're...
- Whatever.

1340
01:28:01,732 --> 01:28:05,819
So this is great. Now I can
look for, um, candles, matches...

1341
01:28:05,902 --> 01:28:08,363
and the liquor cabinet.

1342
01:28:08,447 --> 01:28:11,700
Oh, God.

1343
01:28:16,288 --> 01:28:18,205
I think we should go.

1344
01:28:18,206 --> 01:28:20,792
There's no phone line.
What?

1345
01:28:20,876 --> 01:28:23,045
- I think we should go.
- Why?

1346
01:28:23,128 --> 01:28:25,714
It's our house...
just for tonight.

1347
01:28:25,797 --> 01:28:28,759
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1348
01:28:29,885 --> 01:28:32,304
Which one do you want to be?
Uh...

1349
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:35,891
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1350
01:28:37,392 --> 01:28:40,729
What are you do...

1351
01:28:40,812 --> 01:28:43,023
- Alcohol!
- Oh, boy.

1352
01:28:43,106 --> 01:28:45,692
So, are you okay with wine?

1353
01:28:45,776 --> 01:28:48,445
- I don't know.
- Well, you choose the wine.

1354
01:28:48,487 --> 01:28:52,741
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

1355
01:28:56,161 --> 01:28:58,914
- I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
- I really should go.

1356
01:29:00,665 --> 01:29:03,794
I've gotta catch my ride.

1357
01:29:05,629 --> 01:29:08,131
So go.

1358
01:29:08,173 --> 01:29:10,300
I did.

1359
01:29:10,342 --> 01:29:13,220
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1360
01:29:13,303 --> 01:29:16,098
but you were exciting.

1361
01:29:17,182 --> 01:29:19,182
I wish you'd stayed.

1362
01:29:19,184 --> 01:29:21,895
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1363
01:29:21,978 --> 01:29:25,023
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1364
01:29:25,107 --> 01:29:27,442
Oh, God, I wish I had...

1365
01:29:31,405 --> 01:29:34,533
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1366
01:29:34,616 --> 01:29:39,162
- Well, I came back downstairs, and you were gone.
- I walked out. I walked out the door.

1367
01:29:39,246 --> 01:29:42,082
- Why?
- I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid.

1368
01:29:42,165 --> 01:29:45,502
I was like... It was above
my head. I don't know.

1369
01:29:45,544 --> 01:29:47,544
You were scared?

1370
01:29:47,546 --> 01:29:49,546
Yeah.

1371
01:29:50,549 --> 01:29:53,176
Thought you knew that
about me.

1372
01:29:53,218 --> 01:29:57,222
I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1373
01:29:57,305 --> 01:30:00,934
- Was it something I said?
- Yeah.

1374
01:30:03,729 --> 01:30:06,106
You said, "So go"...

1375
01:30:06,189 --> 01:30:08,650
with such disdain, you know?

1376
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:11,361
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1377
01:30:16,908 --> 01:30:18,908
Joely?

1378
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:21,788
What if you stayed this time?

1379
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:27,085
I walked out the door.

1380
01:30:27,169 --> 01:30:29,169
There's no memory left.

1381
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:32,299
Come back and make up
a good-bye, at least.

1382
01:30:32,382 --> 01:30:34,382
Let's pretend we had one.

1383
01:30:45,437 --> 01:30:47,898
Bye, Joel.

1384
01:30:47,981 --> 01:30:49,981
I love you.

1385
01:30:49,983 --> 01:30:54,237
Meet me in Montauk.

1386
01:30:57,949 --> 01:31:02,120
I didn't crash the plane. The plane
crashed. I didn't crash the plane.

1387
01:31:02,204 --> 01:31:06,291
You were operating the plane with the
remote control, and then it crashed.

1388
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:08,710
It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.

1389
01:31:08,794 --> 01:31:10,794
You're stoned, and you're driving.

1390
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:13,382
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.

1391
01:31:13,465 --> 01:31:15,967
That's why I smoke it. If I'm going
to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.

1392
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:19,679
It does.
That's a medical fact.

1393
01:31:19,763 --> 01:31:22,182
It was proven
on the Science Network.

1394
01:31:22,265 --> 01:31:24,684
- Honey, just watch the road.
- I can't see shit.

1395
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:30,273
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

1396
01:31:30,315 --> 01:31:33,151
- She was nice.
- Yeah, man. Who was that?

1397
01:31:35,278 --> 01:31:38,573
She was, um, just a girl.

1398
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:48,959
Okay.

1399
01:32:24,453 --> 01:32:27,205
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.

1400
01:32:27,289 --> 01:32:29,374
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1401
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:32,794
We'll talk.

1402
01:33:50,789 --> 01:33:52,791
Hey!

1403
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:55,875
Hey.

1404
01:33:57,295 --> 01:34:00,006
- You got a lot of your stuff there, I see.
- Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1405
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:03,510
I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.

1406
01:34:03,593 --> 01:34:07,305
- Do you swear you didn't know?
- I-I swear.

1407
01:34:07,389 --> 01:34:10,976
- So you didn't do the erasing?
- Of course not. God, no.

1408
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:13,270
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1409
01:34:13,311 --> 01:34:17,566
Once, maybe.

1410
01:34:17,649 --> 01:34:20,610
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

1411
01:34:20,694 --> 01:34:23,280
I saw you two talking.

1412
01:34:23,363 --> 01:34:27,117
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, you know.

1413
01:34:27,159 --> 01:34:29,453
How'd I look?

1414
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,912
You looked happy.

1415
01:34:32,914 --> 01:34:35,167
Happy with a secret.

1416
01:34:36,585 --> 01:34:38,585
And after that?

1417
01:34:38,587 --> 01:34:41,757
I never saw you two together
again like that, so I just...

1418
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,510
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

1419
01:35:04,446 --> 01:35:07,491
Montauk train now boarding
on track B. All aboard.

1420
01:35:10,327 --> 01:35:12,788
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1421
01:35:13,997 --> 01:35:16,291
You know that?

1422
01:35:26,343 --> 01:35:28,343
Thanks.

1423
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,047
Let me get my toothbrush.

1424
01:36:04,089 --> 01:36:06,591
Yeah. Just...

1425
01:36:19,187 --> 01:36:21,732
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.

1426
01:36:21,815 --> 01:36:26,194
La-la-la-la-la. I feel like you're
mad at me, and I don't know what I did.

1427
01:36:26,278 --> 01:36:29,030
What did I do?

1428
01:36:29,114 --> 01:36:31,575
I love you so much.

1429
01:36:31,616 --> 01:36:33,618
I'll do anything
to make you happy.

1430
01:36:33,702 --> 01:36:35,954
Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

1431
01:36:36,038 --> 01:36:39,791
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.

1432
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:41,875
Oh. Whew.

1433
01:36:52,637 --> 01:36:55,807
Vámonos, señor.

1434
01:36:55,891 --> 01:36:59,061
I-I had a really nice time
last night.

1435
01:36:59,144 --> 01:37:01,772
Nice?

1436
01:37:01,813 --> 01:37:05,067
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life...

1437
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:07,150
last night.

1438
01:37:07,152 --> 01:37:09,152
That's better.

1439
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:16,453
This is weird. To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

1440
01:37:16,495 --> 01:37:19,998
My name is Mary Svevo."We've
met, but you don't remember me.

1441
01:37:20,082 --> 01:37:24,503
I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased."

1442
01:37:24,586 --> 01:37:27,130
I have since decided that this is a
horrible... Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1443
01:37:27,172 --> 01:37:31,760
In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.

1444
01:37:31,843 --> 01:37:35,430
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.

1445
01:37:35,514 --> 01:37:38,225
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1446
01:37:38,308 --> 01:37:40,519
- What is this?
- I don't know.

1447
01:37:40,602 --> 01:37:45,190
He's boring. Is that enough
reason to erase someone?

1448
01:37:45,273 --> 01:37:48,985
I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now,

1449
01:37:49,027 --> 01:37:51,027
and it's like he changed me.

1450
01:37:51,029 --> 01:37:54,825
I feel like I'm always pissy now. I don't like
myself when I'm with him. I don't like myself anymore.

1451
01:37:54,866 --> 01:37:59,496
I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.

1452
01:37:59,538 --> 01:38:02,749
- That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?

1453
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:05,252
I'm not doing anything. The bloom is
certainly fucking off the rose at this point.

1454
01:38:05,335 --> 01:38:08,296
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

1455
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:10,841
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!

1456
01:38:10,882 --> 01:38:15,262
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...

1457
01:38:43,915 --> 01:38:45,915
Patrick, get the fuck away.

1458
01:38:45,917 --> 01:38:48,336
- Oh, sweetheart...
- Get the fuck away from me!

1459
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:51,631
- Can we talk about it?
- No! Get the fuck away!

1460
01:39:23,914 --> 01:39:26,166
Joel Barish.

1461
01:39:26,249 --> 01:39:29,002
- Hey, Clementine.
- Hey.

1462
01:39:29,086 --> 01:39:32,297
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1463
01:39:33,298 --> 01:39:35,298
Yeah.

1464
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:37,302
Really very educated.

1465
01:39:37,386 --> 01:39:40,806
I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.

1466
01:39:40,889 --> 01:39:43,809
I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?

1467
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:47,312
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

1468
01:39:47,354 --> 01:39:50,774
Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.

1469
01:39:50,816 --> 01:39:53,485
Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...

1470
01:39:53,568 --> 01:39:55,570
- Hi.
- Because she would pronounce...

1471
01:39:55,654 --> 01:39:58,407
- library "libary."
- Hi.

1472
01:39:58,490 --> 01:40:01,618
Libary. Libary.

1473
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:03,660
Look what I found.

1474
01:40:03,662 --> 01:40:07,999
I think if there's a truly
seductive quality about Clementine,

1475
01:40:08,083 --> 01:40:11,753
it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.

1476
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:15,465
You made me look skinny.

1477
01:40:15,507 --> 01:40:18,093
Amazing, burning meteorite...

1478
01:40:18,176 --> 01:40:22,472
will carry you to another world
where things are exciting.

1479
01:40:22,514 --> 01:40:25,559
But what you quickly learn
is that...

1480
01:40:25,642 --> 01:40:28,478
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1481
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,522
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1482
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:34,860
- It's okay.
- So flashy in a kind of obvious way.

1483
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:39,156
- But still, it seduces you.
- Joel, I really like you.

1484
01:40:39,197 --> 01:40:41,450
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1485
01:40:41,533 --> 01:40:45,954
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.

1486
01:40:47,330 --> 01:40:49,330
Where's the real Clementine?

1487
01:40:49,374 --> 01:40:52,502
I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.

1488
01:40:52,544 --> 01:40:55,297
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1489
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:57,591
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you!

1490
01:40:57,674 --> 01:40:59,674
- I do.
- The world's a goddamn mess.

1491
01:40:59,676 --> 01:41:03,305
- Is it some kind of a revolt? Change your hair color.
- You want a drink or something?

1492
01:41:03,388 --> 01:41:06,099
Do you have any whiskey?

1493
01:41:06,183 --> 01:41:11,480
No, I don't think her sex
is... motivated.

1494
01:41:11,563 --> 01:41:14,524
I saw it clearly
the last night we were together.

1495
01:41:14,608 --> 01:41:18,028
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.

1496
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:21,156
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1497
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:24,868
The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her...

1498
01:41:24,951 --> 01:41:27,788
is to fuck 'em...

1499
01:41:27,871 --> 01:41:32,084
or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of 'em.

1500
01:41:32,167 --> 01:41:35,087
And she's so desperate
and insecure...

1501
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:40,008
that she'll, sooner or later,
go around fucking everybody.

1502
01:41:40,092 --> 01:41:43,095
- I don't do that.
- I wouldn't think that about you.

1503
01:41:43,178 --> 01:41:46,056
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1504
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:49,393
Because it really hurts me that you
said that because I don't do that.

1505
01:41:49,434 --> 01:41:52,562
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry about all this. I'm gonna... go.

1506
01:41:52,604 --> 01:41:57,401
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

1507
01:42:01,571 --> 01:42:05,242
Um... bye.

1508
01:42:05,283 --> 01:42:07,911
- Bye.
- I thought I knew her so well.

1509
01:42:07,994 --> 01:42:11,581
- It was nice meeting you and all.
- But I don't know her at all.

1510
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:16,253
What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,

1511
01:42:16,336 --> 01:42:20,257
only to find out
that she's a stranger.

1512
01:42:23,552 --> 01:42:25,554
Wait.

1513
01:42:27,222 --> 01:42:29,222
- What?
- I don't know.

1514
01:42:29,224 --> 01:42:31,393
- Just wait. Just wait.
- What do you want, Joel?

1515
01:42:31,476 --> 01:42:35,981
I don't know. I want you
to wait for... just a while.

1516
01:42:49,536 --> 01:42:52,247
- Okay.
- Really?

1517
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:56,460
I'm not a concept, Joel. I'm just a fucked-up
girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1518
01:42:56,501 --> 01:43:00,464
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything that I don't like about you.

1519
01:43:00,505 --> 01:43:03,216
- Right now I can't.
- But you will. But you will.

1520
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:06,928
You know, you will think of things, and
I'll get bored with you and feel trapped...

1521
01:43:07,012 --> 01:43:09,056
because that's what happens with me.

1522
01:43:10,515 --> 01:43:12,515
Okay.

1523
01:43:16,188 --> 01:43:18,188
Okay.

1524
01:43:22,277 --> 01:43:25,447
- Okay.
- Okay.

1525
01:43:33,372 --> 01:43:35,624
Change your heart

1526
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:41,546
Look around you

1527
01:43:47,886 --> 01:43:50,305
Change your heart

1528
01:43:52,933 --> 01:43:56,061
It will astound you

1529
01:44:00,482 --> 01:44:04,277
Now, I need your lovin'

1530
01:44:06,905 --> 01:44:12,327
Like the sunshine

1531
01:44:14,913 --> 01:44:19,042
And everybody's
gotta learn sometime

1532
01:44:22,212 --> 01:44:26,174
Everybody's gotta learn
sometime

1533
01:44:29,261 --> 01:44:33,974
Everybody's
gotta learn sometime

1534
01:44:34,057 --> 01:44:36,518
Mm-mm-mm

1535
01:44:50,407 --> 01:44:52,743
Change your heart

1536
01:44:55,704 --> 01:44:58,874
And look around you

1537
01:45:04,254 --> 01:45:06,590
Change your heart

1538
01:45:09,885 --> 01:45:13,388
It will astound you

1539
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:21,354
I need your lovin'

1540
01:45:23,815 --> 01:45:29,321
Like the sunshine

1541
01:45:31,907 --> 01:45:36,119
And everybody's
gotta learn sometime

1542
01:45:39,164 --> 01:45:43,335
Everybody's gotta learn
sometime

1543
01:45:46,296 --> 01:45:51,009
Everybody's
gotta learn sometime

1544
01:45:51,093 --> 01:45:54,096
Mm-mm-mm

1545
01:45:58,975 --> 01:46:02,938
Everybody's gotta learn
sometime

1546
01:46:06,024 --> 01:46:09,986
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

1547
01:46:13,115 --> 01:46:17,619
Everybody's gotta learn sometime

1548
01:46:17,703 --> 01:46:20,580
Mm-mm-mm
