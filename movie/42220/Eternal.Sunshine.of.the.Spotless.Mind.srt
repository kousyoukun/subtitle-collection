1
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,769
"真是多谢!"

2
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,579
"前往蒙塔克的火车在B站台"
"Montauk train on track B."

3
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,989
2004年情人节  偶然的想法
Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.

4
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,329
今天是贺卡公司发明的节日
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies

5
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,328
"最后一次播报"
Last call

6
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,888
好让人们感觉像废物
to make people feel like crap.

7
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,558
我今天没去上班
I ditched work today.

8
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,998
而是坐上了去蒙塔克的火车
Took a train out to Montauk.

9
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,768
"请到B站台搭乘前往蒙塔克的火车"
"Montauk train boarding on track B."

10
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:02,437
我不知道原因
I don 't know why.

11
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,677
我不是一个冲动的人
Aah! I'm not an impulsive person.

12
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:17,057
我想只是今早醒来有些茫然失措
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.

13
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:19,456
我得把车送去修理
I gotta get my car fixed.

14
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:21,466
你好  辛迪
Hi. Cindy?

15
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:23,966
我是乔尔  乔尔!
It's Joel. Joel!

16
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:27,996
听着  我今天感觉不舒服
Listen, I don't feel very well today.

17
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:30,006
不  我想是食物中毒
No, food poisoning, I think.

18
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:33,565
这海滩实在是冷死人
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

19
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:36,205
二月份的蒙塔克  真是不错  乔尔
Montauk in February Brilliant,Joel.

20
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,915
被撕掉的页
Page is ripped out.

21
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,505
不记得自己撕过
Don't remember doing that.

22
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,614
这好像是我两年来的头一次记录
It appears this is my first entry in two years.

23
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:59,424
不要过度赞美细沙
Sand is overrated.

24
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:02,623
它们不过是细小的岩石
It's just tiny, little rocks.

25
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:14,933
希望我能结识新的伴侣
If only, I could meet someone new.

26
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:18,882
但我想这样的机会很小
I guess my chances of that happening are some what diminished,

27
00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:23,552
我不敢和眼前这陌生女人 做目光的接触
seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.

28
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,822
也许我该和内奥米重修旧好
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.

29
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:30,592
她很美丽  美丽就是好
She was nice. Nice is good.

30
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:35,161
她爱过我
She loved me.

31
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,269
为什么我总是爱上每个
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see

32
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,209
对我稍加注意的女人?
who shows me the least bit of attention?

33
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:02,276
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

34
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:06,016
-我只是问好  -嗨  你好
-I just said hi. - Hi. Hello. Hi.

35
00:05:07,216 --> 00:05:09,745
我可以坐近些吗?
Okay if I sit closer?

36
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,825
你到哪儿去?
How far are you going?

37
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,155
嗯  洛克威尔中心
Uh, Rockville Center.

38
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,525
不会吧!  我也是!
Get out! Me too!

39
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:20,535
-真的?  -真巧
Really? What are the odds?

40
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:24,754
我认识你吗?
Do I know you?

41
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:29,504
你是不是在巴恩斯・洛贝尔店买过书?
Do you ever shop at Barnes & Noble?

42
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:31,704
-是的  -那就对了!
Sure. Sure. That's it!

43
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,144
-什么?  -我以前见过你
Yeah? I've seen you, man!

44
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:38,373
我在那里作售书员已经五年了
Book slave there for, like, five years now.

45
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,813
-啊  我想我可能记得你  -天  是五年吗?
Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you. Jesus! Is it five years?

46
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,983
可能是头发的缘故
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:46,183
-可能什么?  -发型改变了很多
What might? It changes a lot.

48
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:49,553
我改变了发型的颜色  那就是你没认出我来的原因
The color. That's why you might not recognize me.

49
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:53,292
-这发型颜色叫"蓝色废墟"  -很对
It's called Blue Ruin, the color. Right. Yeah.

50
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:55,692
-很时髦的名字  对吧?  -我喜欢
Snappy name, huh? I like it.

51
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,332
这公司所做出的全色系的发型  名字都很时髦
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.

52
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,862
红色威胁、黄色狂热、绿色革命
Red-- Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

53
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:08,871
一定有专门职位来命名这些发型
That'd be a job coming up with those names.

54
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:11,881
会有那样的工作吗?
You think there could possibly be a job like that?

55
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:15,471
我是说 总共才有多少种发型颜色呢? 也许十五种吧
I mean how many hair colors could there be? Fifty, maybe.

56
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:17,571
有人在做这工作
Someone's got that job.

57
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:22,690
我能想出来的-橙色特工!
Agent Orange! I came up with that one.

58
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,660
我用发型颜色来表明我的个性
I apply my personality in a paste.

59
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:27,660
噢  我很怀疑
Oh, I doubt that very much.

60
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:30,220
因为你不认识我  那么
Well, you don't know me, so

61
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,420
你并不了解我  对吧?
you don't know, do you?

62
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,669
对不起  我只是想尽量显得友好些
Sorry. I was just-- I'm trying to be nice.

63
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,499
好的  我明白了
Yeah. I got it.

64
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,998
-顺便提一下  我叫克莱门汀  -我叫乔尔
My name's Clementine, by the way. I'm Joel.

65
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:08,397
你好  乔尔
Hi,Joel. Hey.

66
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:10,987
不准取笑我的名字
No jokes about my name.

67
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:14,367
不  你不会那么做的  你想尽量友好些
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that. You're trying to be nice.

68
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:18,367
我不知怎样取笑你的名字
I don't know any jokes about your name.

69
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:20,607
腰浆果狗(卡通片名)
Huckleberry Hound.

70
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:23,236
我不知道那是什么
I don't know what that means.

71
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,446
你不知道腰浆果狗?  你白痴么?
Huckleberry Hound? What are you nuts?

72
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:28,446
有人曾这样暗示过
It's been suggested.

73
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:31,616
我亲爱的 我亲爱的克莱门汀
Oh my darling, oh my darling, Oh my darling Clementine

74
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,786
你已永远离去
You were lost and gone forever

75
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:36,386
多么抱歉  克莱门汀
Dreadful sorry Clementine

76
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,395
知道了吗?
No?

77
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:42,395
对不起  但那真是个美丽的名字
I'm sorry. Just-- It's a pretty name, though. It really is nice.

78
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:44,455
它的意思是  "仁慈"
It's, uh-- It means "merciful."

79
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:46,465
对吗 仁慈?
Right? Clemency?

80
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:48,735
虽然看上去不像
Although it hardly fits.

81
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,105
但说真的  我是一个报复心极强的小贱货
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

82
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:53,604
我不会那样想
Gee, I wouldn't think that aboutyou.

83
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:56,874
-为什么?  -我不知道
Why wouldn't you think that about me? I don't know.

84
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,174
我只是
I just--

85
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,584
我不知道  我只是
I don't know. I just, uh--

86
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,584
你看上去是好人  那
You seem nice, so--

87
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:05,674
噢  现在我成好人啦?
Oh, now I'm nice?

88
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:08,914
上帝!  难道你不会用别的形容词汇吗?
Oh, God. Don't you know any other adjectives?

89
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:10,923
我不需要好
I don't need "nice."

90
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:14,983
我不想对别人好  也不想别人对我好
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.

91
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:19,823
乔尔?
Joel?

92
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,163
你的名字是乔尔吧?
It's Joel, right?

93
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,672
是的
Yes.

94
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:28,172
对不起  冲你大喊大叫
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

95
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:31,732
我今天有些不开心
I'm a little out of sorts today.

96
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:42,321
我得不好意思的承认
My embarrassing admission is,

97
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:45,321
我真的喜欢你对我好
I really like that you're nice right now.

98
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:50,221
我的意思是 我不知道下一时刻自己会喜欢什么
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like,

99
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,291
但是现在
but right now

100
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,420
我很高兴你对我好
I'm glad you are.

101
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:06,800
我有很多事情  我也许该
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should

102
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,969
-我正在写作  -对不起
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay. I-I'm writing, and--

103
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,139
-不 不用  -没什么
No, no. I just-- Sure. No. That's okay.

104
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,809
我只是得 你知道 这是 好吧
I just have-- You know, this is-- Okay.

105
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,289
保重
- Take care, then.

106
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,349
老天!
Jesus!

107
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,598
我可以送你一程 如果你需要的话
Hi. I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.

108
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,608
天很冷
It's cold.

109
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,577
好 好的
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah?

110
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,547
都结霜了
It is frosty.

111
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:46,407
-你不是在跟踪我吧?  -我没有
You're not a stalker or anything, right? I'm not a stalker.

112
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:48,577
是你先和我说话的  还记得吗?
You're the one that talked to me. Remember?

113
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:50,917
那是跟踪守则中最老土的伎俩
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.

114
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:53,117
真的吗?  有这本书?
Really? There's a stalker book?

115
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:57,786
好的  我会读读看
I gotta read that one.

116
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:07,296
看 我对刚才的疯狂表现感到抱歉  我并不是这样
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

117
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,766
没什么  我没想过你是
Oh, it's okay. I didn't think you were.

118
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:19,475
你想喝一杯吗?
Did you wanna have a drink?

119
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:21,735
我有很多种酒  我可以
I have lots of drinks, and I could

120
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:25,744
算了
Never mind.

121
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:28,184
-对不起 那真傻  真难为情  -不 不 不
Sorry. That was stupid. I'm embarrassed now. No, no, no, no.

122
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:30,244
晚安  乔尔
Good night,Joel.

123
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:51,833
两杯蓝色废墟
Two Blue Ruins.

124
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:54,643
谢谢
Thank you.

125
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:56,642
喝光它  小子
Drink up, young man.

126
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:59,512
这样我勾引你就不会惹你反感了
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

127
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,752
我只是开玩笑!
I'm just kidding!

128
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:06,812
来吧
Come on.

129
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:14,751
你有点内向  是吧?
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren'tyou?

130
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:16,761
对不起
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:21,321
那只是  我的生活很无趣
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.

132
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,001
我去上班  我下班回家
I go to work, I come home.

133
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:28,570
我不知道有什么好说的
Don't know what to say.

134
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,580
你应看看我的日记
You should read myjournal.

135
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:35,140
我的意思是  我的生活全是 空白
I mean, it's just blank.

136
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:38,450
真的?  那让你觉得悲哀或忧虑吗?
Really? Does that make you sad oranxious?

137
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:41,850

I mean, I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest,

138
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,859
可以利用各种可能性

来确保我没有浪费  我所拥有的每一秒

奇怪的是  我想你!

166
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:51,711
你说"我想你"  我想那就意味着我们结婚了

如果冰破了怎么办?
What if it breaks?

180
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,818
什么如果?  你真的这么在意?
- "What if'? Do you really care right now?

189
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,876

做好准备  像预定座位什么的

So I call her and she's changed her number.

258
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:35,727

So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know to get her something.

263
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:53,506
她看着我的样子  好像她根本不认识我
And she looks at me like she doesn't even know who I am.

264
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:56,015

00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:47,892
有人想吸大麻吗?

276
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,572
上帝啊  她在惩罚我
Oh, God. She's punishing me.

277
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:54,572
-我知道  -因为我说了实话
I know, honey. For being honest.

278
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,901
-这真糟糕  -我该直接去她家
It's horrible. I should just go to her house.

279
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:59,911
不!  不  你不会想去那儿的
No! No, no, no. You don't wanna go there, man. You don't wanna go there.

280
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,341
下去  那太
Get off. It's too--

281
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:04,351
对
Right. Yeah.

282
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:06,351
我不想她看到我这么绝望
I don't want to seem desperate.

283
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:08,711
乔尔  为什么你不把这看着一个信号呢?
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,

284
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:11,011
一个彻底分手的信号
make a clean break. Right?

285
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:14,220
对吗?
Right?

286
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:18,360
好吧  乔尔 老实说
All right, Joel, look man seriously.

287
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:20,360
-罗布!  -事情是这样
Rob! Here's the deal.

288
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:23,590
不要这样  罗布  你要干什么?  不  不要
Don't do that. Rob, what are you doing? No, no, no, no.

289
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,250
那你有什么好建议呢  卡丽?
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?

290
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,829
你有什么完美的解决办法?
What's your brilliant reasoned solution?

291
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,429
你会把我们卷进来  这不关我们的事
You're gonna make this about our shit now? This isn't about us.

292
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,569
对  这不关我们的事  这关乔尔的事  他已经长大了
I agree. It's not about us. It's about Joel, who's an adult. Okay?

293
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,629
不再是"卡丽妈咪"的小孩子
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

294
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,879
你在说  你自己去洗!
-What are you? -That's your laundry!

295
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:44,838
太好了  好极了
That's great. That's good.

296
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:56,857
原来是这样
Okay.

297
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,227
亲爱的艾克姆夫妇

298
00:24:58,228 --> 00:24:59,597
克莱门汀・克罗斯基从她的记忆中抹去了乔尔

299
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:01,897
请别再向她提起他们以前的关系

300
00:25:01,908 --> 00:25:03,807
谢谢  空白有限公司

301
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:08,067
-这是什么?  -我不知道  是做什么研究的地方吧
What is it? I don't know. It's some place that does a thing.

302
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:21,976
早安  这是空白有限公司
Good morning. Lacuna.

303
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:25,976

No, I'm sorry. That offer expired after the new year.

304
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:31,885
当然  我们可以给你安排
Yeah, sure. We can fit you in.

305
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,265
第五位怎么样?
How about on the fifth?

306
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:37,735
星期三  好的  你可以拼读出来吗?
That's a Wednesday. All right, great. Could you spell that please?

307
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:42,335
好的  请告知你的日间电话
Okay, and we'll need a daytime phone number.

好  祝你今天愉快!  再见
Great. Have a nice day. See you then.

309
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:48,014
你有什么事?
May I help you?

310
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:51,014
-我是乔尔・巴瑞斯  -什么?
I 'm Joel Barish. Excuse me?

311
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:56,644
我是乔尔・巴瑞斯  我和米R维克医生有个约见
I 'm Joel. Barish. I have an appointment with Dr.Mierzwiak.

312
00:25:56,724 --> 00:26:00,023
-你可以填这个表单吗?  -我只想和他谈一谈
-Here. Could you please fill this out? -I just want to talk to him.

313
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:02,083
-你仍得先填这表单  先生  -真的吗?
You still need to fill the form out, sir. Really?

314
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:05,253
谢谢
-Thank you. -Great.

315
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:07,263
我没有钢笔
I don't have a pen.

316
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,423
在那儿有一支
There's a pen right there.

317
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:12,433
早安  空白有限公司
Good morning. Lacuna. Oh.

318
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:16,372
那个报价在元旦后过期了
That offer. That's done now. That expired after the new year.

319
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:18,432
巴瑞斯先生
Mr. Barish?

320
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,742
你今天好吧?
How are we today?

321
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:24,742
不是很好
Not too good actually.

322
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:26,742
天  斯坦!
Oh, my God! Stan!

323
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:29,751
-对不起  我只是在  -我在工作
Sorry. Sorry, I was just I'm working!

324
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:33,111
对不起
Sorry. Sorry.

325
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,181
-这里  医生  -谢谢
Here, Doctor. Thank you.

326
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:38,121
你不应该看到这个
You should not have seen this.

327
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,181
真对不起
I apologize.

328
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,500
这是开玩笑  对吗?  这是克莱门汀她
This is a hoax, right? I mean, this is Clem--

329
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,400
-我向你保证  -不是的
I am sure you. No.

330
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:57,570
这算什么
There's no such thing as this.

331
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,279
瞧  巴瑞斯先生  客户档案是保密的
Look, our files are confidential, Mr.Barish,

332
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,819
我不能把它们给你看
so I can't show you evidence.

333
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,619
这样说吧  克罗斯基活得很不快乐
Suffice it to say that Miss, Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

334
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,749
她想要新的生活
and she wanted to move on.

335
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:14,758
我们提供了可行性
We provide that possibility.

336
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:18,888
克罗斯基活得很不快乐  她想要新的生活
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.

337
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:21,488
我们提供了可行性
We provide that possibility."

338
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:23,498
那是什么鬼话?
What the hell is that?

339
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:26,498
我是她遇到过的最好的男人
Nicest guy she everwent out with.

340
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:31,007
天  罗布!  别敲了!
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

341
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:33,007
没什么
It's okay. It's all right.

342
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:35,777
卡丽  我正在作鸟屋
Carrie, I am making a bird house.

343
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:41,547
我怎么说呢?  乔尔  你了解克莱门汀  她就是这样
What can Isay, Joel? You know Clementine. She's like that.

344
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,417
做事冲动
She's impulsive.

345
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:47,046
她一时兴起就想将你彻底忘记
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.

346
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:52,896
一时兴起?
A lark.

347
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:56,396
为什么?  为什么?  为什么你要那样做?
Why? Why? Why? Why did you do that?

348
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,735
等等  等等!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

349
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,735
对不起  医生  他硬闯进来
I'm sorry, Doctor. He just barged right in here.

350
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,305
-好吧  我想清除我的记忆
Okay. I want it done.

351
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:07,875
-我告诉他在情人节前我们是最忙的
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.

352
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:11,245
-没事的  玛丽  -但有人还等着
that's okay, Mary. -But there are people waiting.

353
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,245
巴瑞斯先生  如果你愿意进来
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to come inside.

354
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:17,874
-玛丽  你能送走吴女士吗?  -当然可以
And Mary, if you could take care of Mrs Woo. Yes, of course.

355
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:27,624
我们要你做的头一件事  巴瑞斯先生
the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

356
00:28:27,695 --> 00:28:29,624
就是回家
is to go home.

357
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:35,133
寻找所有与克莱门汀有关的事物
and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.

358
00:28:35,204 --> 00:28:37,433
所有的
Anything.

359
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:42,363
我们会用这些事物在你的大脑里
And we'll use these items to

360
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:45,813
建立一个与克莱门汀有关的映象
create a map of Clementine in your brain.

361
00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:50,942
所以我们需要相片、衣物、礼品
So we'll need, photos, clothing, gifts,

362
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:55,972
像她送给你的书  你们俩一起购买的CD
books she may have bought you CDs, you may have bought together,

363
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:58,682
日记
journal entries.

364
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,522
我们想清空你的家
We want to empty your home.

365
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:04,921
我们想从你生命中清除克莱门汀
We want to empty your life of Clementine.

366
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:07,241
在那个映象被建立后
And after the mapping is done,

367
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:09,491
技术员今晚会到你家作记忆消除术
our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.

368
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:12,901
这样  你第二天清晨醒来时
That way, when you awake in the morning,

369
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:17,411
你发现自己躺在床上  就像什么也没发生过一样
you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened.

370
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:19,960
一个全新的生活等待着你
a new life waiting you.

371
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:26,440
别作白日梦  伙计!
Wake up, buddy!

372
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,419
对不起  索贝尔夫人
No, I'm sorry. Mrs.Sobel.

373
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,649
你不能一个月做三次记忆消除术
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.

374
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,319
这是我们的制度  你好吗  巴瑞斯先生?
Well, it's just not our policy. How are you today, Mr. Barish?

375
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,059
你好  我还在线
Hello. I'm right here.

376
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,229
我知道这很紧急  我们会尽力把你
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can

377
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:49,328
安排到三月份头一个
We can fit you in on the first of March.

378
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:52,838
也许你该跟医生说说
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, and he--

379
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,038
好吧  我们就这样约定了
All right, so let's make an appointment.

380
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,168
你星期几来?
What day would you like to come in this week?

381
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:00,678
-巴瑞斯先生  -医生今下午真的很忙
Mr. Barish. he's really busy this afternoon.

382
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:04,707
也许明天十二点一刻比较好
Maybe tomorrow would be better. Around 12:15? Can you do that?

383
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:08,657
因为二月有情人节  所以我们忙得够呛
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.

384
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,857
这是斯坦・范恩
This is Stan Fink,

385
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,526
我们最好的技术人员之一
one of ourmost experienced andskilled technicians.

386
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:25,096
他今晚为你做消除术
He'll be handling your case tonight.

387
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,606
很高兴认识你  巴瑞斯先生
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

388
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,606
我叫乔尔・巴瑞斯
My name is Joel Barish,

389
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:34,236
我来这儿消除对克莱门汀・克罗斯基的记忆
and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.

390
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:39,335
很好  现在告诉我关于克莱门汀的事
Very good. Now tell me about Clementine.

391
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,945
嗯 我
Uh, I was

392
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:45,815
本来和另一个女人一起生活  她叫内奥米
Living with this woman, Naomi,

393
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:48,455
几年前
uh, a couple years ago,

394
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:51,144
我的朋友罗布和卡丽请我们去一个海滩聚会
and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach.

395
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:53,754
我不喜欢聚会
I don't like parties.

396
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:57,064
内奥米不能去  但我去了
Naomi couldn't go, but I went

397
00:30:57,135 --> 00:31:00,294
而且遇到了克莱门汀
and I met Clementine.

398
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:03,364
对不起
I 'm sorry.

399
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,373
让我们从你最近的回忆开始
Let's start with your most recent memories

400
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:10,033
然后慢慢向以前删除
and work back wards from there, more or less.

401
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:12,043
我们的每一段记忆中
There's an emotional core

402
00:31:12,114 --> 00:31:14,053
都会有一个感情核心
to each of our memories,

403
00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:17,883
当这个核心被清除掉时  相应的记忆会缓慢消失
and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.

404
00:31:17,953 --> 00:31:20,382
明早你醒来时
By the time you wake up in the morning,

405
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:24,182
相应的记忆就会消失无踪
all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared,

406
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:26,282
就像快醒时做的梦一样
as in a dream upon waking.

407
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:29,662
有损伤大脑的危险吗?
Is there any risk of brain damage?

408
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,722
从技术角度讲
Well, uh, technically speaking,

409
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,731
这过程本身就是对大脑的伤害
the procedure is brain damage,

410
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:37,631
但只相当于一场宿醉
but it's on a parwith a night of heavy drinking.

411
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:39,641
你不会有事的
Nothing you'll miss.

412
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:44,111
舒服吗?
Comfortable?

413
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:47,811
巴瑞斯先生  我们现在做的是生成你的脑部图
What we're doing here Mr. Barish is actually creating a map of your brain.

414
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:50,210
好  我们开始吧
Okay, let's getstarted.

415
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:54,010
如果你想今晚就做的话  我们有些准备工作要做
If we want to get this procedure under way tonight. We have some work to do.

416
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:57,920
巴瑞斯先生  我要你对这些物体作出反应
I want you to react to these objects Mr. Barish, if you will.

417
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:03,030
这里面有一个好故事.
There's a good story behind this one.

418
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,029
巴瑞斯先生  我会得到比较准确的情感读数
Actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout.

419
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,999
如果你只在脑海里描述
If you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.

420
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,999
所以把集中精力来回忆
Just try to focus on the memories.

421
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,629
-对不起  -没什么
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

422
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,849
健康活性集中在那儿 健康读数很好
Healthy activity up there again. Healthy readouts Very good.

423
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:24,178
另一件物体
-Here's another object. -That's so.

424
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:26,838
下一件
Next item. Okay.

425
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,348
"土豆头"
Potato head.

426
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,688
下一件
-Next item. Okay. -

427
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:38,627
集中精力去回忆  帕特里克  帮帮我
Just focus on the memories. Patrick, do me a fiavor.

428
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:42,027
-帕特里克  帮帮我好吗?  -好的
Patrick, do me a fiavor, will you? Yeah.

429
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:45,967
你能检查下稳压器吗?
Can you check the voltage regulator? What do we got there?

430
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:47,967
-电压看来合适  -真的吗?
-voltage looks fine. Really?

431
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:52,027
我这里不太清楚
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.

432
00:32:54,977 --> 00:33:00,106
技术上讲  这个过程就是大脑损伤
Well, technically, the procedure is brain damage.

433
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,646
请检查一下电路连接
Check the connections, please.

434
00:33:06,426 --> 00:33:09,085
你在这里
Oh, there you are.

435
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:18,525
为什么我?  我不能理解我所看到的
Why am I? I don't understand what I'm looking at.

436
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,395
为什么我站在这儿而
Why am I standing here and--

437
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:24,304
天  幻觉记忆!
Oh, my God. Dejavu.

438
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,464
一切似曾相识!  这太
Dejavu. This is so--

439
00:33:26,545 --> 00:33:29,474
好  那让我们开始吧  如果我们想今晚就做的话
All right, we should get started. If we're gonna get the procedure.

440
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:32,474
那我们现在有些准备工作要做
under way tonight, we have some work to do.

441
00:33:32,545 --> 00:33:35,074
我已经进入自己的回忆  对吧?
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

442
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:38,483
我想是这样的  这是对的
I suppose so. Uh, this is about right.

443
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:41,543
这就是  这就是记忆清除看上去的样子
This is what it This is what it would look like.

444
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:46,053
很好
Very good.

445
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,393
结束后我们会清除这些物品
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.

446
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:50,793
以后你就不会因为他们为什么
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence

447
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:54,122
在你家里而困惑了
in your home.

448
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:55,632
-帕特里克?  -什么?
Patrick? Yeah?

449
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:58,362
帕特里克  你能检查  帕特里克?
Patrick, can you check-- Patrick?

450
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:01,892
-我看到自己声音的读数  -帕特里克?
-I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice. Patrick? Patrick?

451
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,872
-为什么这么多电线?  -有很多设备
-Why are there so many wires? -A lot of equipment.

452
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:09,741
-有作用吗?  -你确信你正确安装了这些设备吗?
-Does that help? -Are you sure you set that thing up properly?

453
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:11,751
-好点了吗?  -今天怎么样  巴瑞斯先生?
-How's that? -How are you today, Mr. Barish?

454
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:13,911
-我们在这儿  巴瑞斯先生  -好点了
There we are, Mr. Barish. That's better.

455
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:17,321
-我不知道自己是否喜欢这样  -我也许该试试这样
-I don't know if I like this. -Think I might try this then.

456
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:19,291
快完成了
We're almost done now.

457
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:22,481
日记的价值无法衡量
Journal. That would be invaluable.

458
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,650
我今晚遇到了一个人  我不知该做些什么
"I met someone tonight. I don't know what to do.

459
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,290
她叫克莱门汀  她很漂亮
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing. "

460
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:34,900
什么?  小心点!  退回去!
What? What? Come on! Careful! Step back!

461
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:36,900
放松些!
Just take it easy.

462
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,799
好的
That's fine.

463
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,709
不要伤害到他了
Let's not roach the guy.

464
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,239
好的  你调好了
All right, you got that one.

465
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,119
-这里像垃圾堆对吧?  -这是公寓房  帕特里克
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think? It's an apartment, Patrick.

466
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,449
帕特里克
Patrick.

467
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,618
那好  不像垃圾堆  但就像一个未赋予灵感的荒原
Well, not a dump then but sorta plain. Uninspired.

468
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:59,128
还有一股霉臭味
And there's sort of a stale smell.

469
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:03,758
帕特里克 我们能不能不管这些?
Patrick, can we just please get through this?

470
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:07,458
-我们还要过漫长的一夜 -好的
We got a very long night ahead of us. Come on. Yeah.

471
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:14,967
这是我上次看到你的情景
This is the last time I saw you.

472
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:32,086
现在是凌晨三点
It's 3:00.

473
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:36,756
我把你的车弄坏了
I kind a sorta wrecked your car.

474
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:38,765
酒后驾车了吗?
Were you driving drunk?

475
00:35:38,826 --> 00:35:41,095
真是悲惨
It's pathetic.

476
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,395
我是有一点醉
I was a little tipsy.

477
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:45,405
但别说我悲惨!
Don't call me pathetic.

478
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:47,405
这就是悲惨
Well, it is pathetic.

479
00:35:47,476 --> 00:35:50,405
-还真他妈不负责任  你可能撞死了人
I t's fucking i rresponsible. Could've killed somebody.

480
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:53,405
-你也许已经撞死人了  我们该看看新闻?
Maybe you did kill somebody. Should we turn on the news and see?

481
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:55,124
-也许我该查查看是否有小孩或小动物被撞死?
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?

482
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,774
我没有撞死人!
I didn't kill anybody!

483
00:35:56,845 --> 00:36:00,714
那只是个凹痕  约尔  你像个老妇人一样嗦
It's just a fucking dent, Joel. You're like an old lady or something.

484
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,214
你像个什么样?
Well, what are you like?

485
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:05,224
-一个酒鬼!  -一个酒鬼?
A wino? A wino?

486
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:08,224
天  你是从五十年代来的吗?
Jesus, Are you from the 50s or something?

487
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:10,223
酒鬼?
A wino?

488
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,553
老实说吧  乔伊
Face it, Joely.

489
00:36:12,624 --> 00:36:17,063
你发火是因为我今晚很晚都没回来
You're freaked out because I was out late without you,

490
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:20,063
在你的小脑袋里
and in your little wormy brain

491
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:24,133
你尽力想发现她是不是和别人做爱了?
you're trying to figure out did she fuck someone tonight?

492
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,672
不 克莱
No, see, Clem,

493
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:30,332
我想你和别人做爱了
I assume you fucked someone tonight.

494
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,842
不然别人怎么会喜欢你?
Isn't that how you get people to like you?

495
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:46,091
我道歉  好吗?
I'm sorry. Okay?

496
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,991
克莱  我不是有意的
Clem, I didn't mean it. All right?

497
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:56,430
-克莱  -钥匙还你!
Clem? Your key's.

498
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:59,440
-我只是  -我不再需要它们了
-I was just I won't need them any more.

499
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:02,600
有些烦心、生气  我也不知道自己怎么啦
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.

500
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,309
克莱?
Clem?

501
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,279
完成了
Got it.

502
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,289
玛丽今晚会过来
Mary's coming over tonight.

503
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,989
只是想让你知道
Just thoughtyou'd wanna know.

504
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,089
我喜欢玛丽  我喜欢她看我们  但我不觉得她喜欢我
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.

505
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,718
她喜欢你  得了吧
She likes you okay.

506
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:30,888
所以我也许该把女友叫来  我现在有女友了
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over. I have a girlfriend now.

507
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:33,488
我告诉过你我有女友了吗?
Do whateveryou want. Did I tell you I have

508
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:42,907
我告诉过你我有女友了吗?
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

509
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:44,917
我们得把精力集中在工作上  帕特里克
We gotta focus here, Patrick.

510
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:46,917
问题是
Yeah, the thing is

511
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:49,887
我们的处境有点怪异
our situation  is a little weird.

512
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:51,947
我女友的情况
My girlfriend situation.

513
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:54,817
我确信是这样
I'm sure it is.

514
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,876
你一定是开玩笑
You gotta be

515
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:24,885
克莱  让我送你回家吧
Clem, let me drive you home.

516
00:38:24,955 --> 00:38:27,044
从我面前消失掉!  该死!
Get out of my face, faggot!

517
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:32,014
看那边!  这里在倒塌
Look at it out here! It's all falling apart!

518
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:34,454
我在忘掉你  我很高兴这样做!
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

519
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:36,464
是你先这样对我的!
You did it to me first!

520
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:40,524
我不敢相信你竟然这样对我!  该死!
I can't believe you did this to me. Goddamn it.

521
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:43,533
克莱!  你听到了吗?
Clem! Can you hear me?

522
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:46,193
到明天早上  我就会彻底忘了你!
By morning you'll be gone!

523
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:49,763
真是这狗屁爱情的完美结局!
The perfect ending to this piece-of-shit story!

524
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:58,573
一个女孩被我吸引会有问题吗?  有问题吗?
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me? Is that a problem?

525
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:01,172
不  那很有趣
No, I think it's funny.

526
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:04,342
你觉得我和这家伙哪个更好看?
So, who do you think's better-looking me or this guy?

527
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:06,352
帕特里克 我们集中精力做好工作
Patrick, let's focus buddy.

528
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:09,022
记得我们上星期做过的那个女孩么?
Remember that girl we did last week?

529
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:12,222
带着土豆的女孩?
The one with the potatoes?

530
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:17,371
-那个女孩?  -是他的女友
That girl? That's this guy's girl.

531
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,371
是的
Right. Yeah.

532
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:22,371
曾经是  我们小心点
Was. We took care of that.

533
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:27,871
那晚我有点爱上她了
I kind a fell in love with her that night.

534
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:30,880
什么?  你这
What? You little fuck

535
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,940
-怎么?  -她毫无知觉
What? She was unconscious, man.

536
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:37,040
她很漂亮而且
Well, she was beautiful, and

537
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:40,110
我偷了她的内裤
I stole a pair ofher panties as well.

538
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,959
-天!  -怎么?
Jesus! What?

539
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,959
那不是
It's not like--

540
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,529
-我是说那些内裤很干净
I mean, they were clean and all.

541
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,019
不要跟我说  我不想听这些狗屁
Don't tell me this stuff, man! I don't wanna hear this shit!

542
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,529
-是干净的  -不  别说啦
They,were clean! What? D-Don't! Stop!

543
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,039
-好的  -我们还有工作要做
Okay. All right! We got work to do.

544
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,089
把那些纸给我
Give me my papers.

545
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:16,347
还有些事
There's more.

546
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:20,457
那天我们做完她的手术后
After we did her,

547
00:40:20,528 --> 00:40:23,927
我去了她工作的地方并和她约会
I kind of went to where she works and asked her out.

548
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:27,327
你作了什么?
You what?

549
00:40:27,397 --> 00:40:30,026
天!  帕特里克
Jesus. Patrick!

550
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:34,066
你知不知道这样
Do you have any idea

551
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:35,966
没有职业道德?
how unethical?

552
00:40:36,037 --> 00:40:38,976
不会吧
It's not really that bad.

553
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:41,776
看看你的表情  怎么啦?
What? Get that look off your face. What's wrong?

554
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:45,146
帕特里克!  你偷了这女孩的内裤
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!

555
00:40:56,466 --> 00:40:58,455
有人在这里
There's someone here.

556
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:01,434
他偷了你的内裤
He stole your underwear.

557
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:05,664
鬼影都没看见
I don't see anyone.

558
00:41:21,184 --> 00:41:24,213
乔尔?
Joel?

559
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:26,683
我的鞋子在哪里?
Where are my boots?

560
00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:30,213
你为什么给我毒药?  你不懂英文吗?
Why, are you showing me poisons? Can't you understand English?

561
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:33,282
药剂  我说的是药剂
"Potions" I said. Potions.

562
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:41,672
请给我爱情药剂
Love potion, please.

563
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,632
我真他妈吓得直起鸡皮疙瘩!
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin!

564
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,261
我该把你一个人甩在跳蚤市场
Should've left you at the flea market.

565
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:54,581
要做的第一件事是
First thing to do is--

566
00:41:54,652 --> 00:41:57,641
往杯中撒用鲸鱼心脏做的粉末
sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.

567
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:05,050
想走了吗?
Wanna go?

568
00:42:06,431 --> 00:42:08,360
我想要个小孩
I want to have a baby.

569
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:11,330
我们以后再谈这个吧
Let's talk about it later.

570
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:14,560
不要  我想要个小孩
No! I want to have a baby.

571
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,639
我想我们还没准备好
I don't think we're ready.

572
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,729
是你没准备好
You're not ready.

573
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,039
克莱  你真的认为你能照顾好小孩?
Clem, do you really think you could take care of a kid?

574
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,269
什么?
What?

575
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,209
我不想在这儿谈这个
I don't wanna talk about it here.

576
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:33,048
我听不见  我从来不知道你他妈的说些什么
I can't hear you. I can never the fuck understand what you're saying.

577
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,548
-我不想谈这个  -不要这么小声!
I don't wanna talk about this! Fucking ventrilo quist!

578
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,048
-就要谈!  -我不想
We're fucking gonna talk about it! I don't want to--

579
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:40,718
你不能在那样说我后  还说你不想再谈了!
You can't just say something like that and say you don't wanna talk about it!

580
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:43,728
-对不起  克莱  -我会当一个好母亲的
I'm sorry, Clem. I'd make a fucking good mother!

581
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:46,008
我喜欢小孩子  我聪明又富有创意
I love children, I'm creative and smart,

582
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:48,227
我会当好母亲的!
and I'd make a fucking great mother!

583
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:51,667
是你  乔尔!  是你不能成什么事
It's you,Joel. It's you who can't commit to anything!

584
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:55,427
-这被清除了!  -你不知道你有多么幸运我看上了你
It's going! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!

585
00:42:55,508 --> 00:42:58,437
也许我们该在这里分手了  约尔!
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!

586
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:00,187
-把你和愚蠢的服装珠宝一起甩在跳蚤市场
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!

587
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:01,876
-清除了  这段回忆是垃圾
-It's done. This is crap.

588
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:04,186
-也许你能找把古董摇椅好去死在上面
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!

589
00:43:04,187 --> 00:43:06,436
-所有的这些痛苦和迷惑
-All the pain, confusion

590
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,046
-你好  帕特里克  -你好  玛丽  还好吗?
-Hi, Patrick. -Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

591
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,055
-你好  -天真冷
Hey, you. Oh, it's freezing outside.

592
00:43:19,126 --> 00:43:20,955
-我们做得还不错吧?  -是的
Find us okay? Yeah.

593
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:26,825
-嗯  -真亲热!
Mmm. Hot!

594
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:29,965
可怜的家伙
Poor guy.

595
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:35,064
有真正的饮料喝吗?
Don't you have anything real to drink?

596
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:38,074
我们真的还未检查过
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.

597
00:43:38,145 --> 00:43:40,074
-帕特里克?
Patrick?

598
00:43:40,145 --> 00:43:42,544
让我来吧
Let me do the honors.

599
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:45,784
玛丽讨厌我
Mary hates me.

600
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:48,513
我从不讨女人的欢心
Never really had much luck with the ladies.

601
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,523
也许你该停止偷她们的内裤
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.

602
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,613
斯坦  斯坦
Stan. Stan.

603
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:55,123
-还有更多事  -别说了!
There's more. No!

604
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,493
-是的  -不!
Yes. No!

605
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:03,463
你不想要酒吧 帕特里克?
You didn't want any, did you, Patrick?

606
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:06,132
-不要  没什么  -等等
Uh, no, that's okay. Wait.

607
00:44:06,203 --> 00:44:10,502
祝福那些健忘的人吧  因为他们战胜了自己过去的错误
"Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders."

608
00:44:21,352 --> 00:44:24,791
尼采的《超越善恶》
That's Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil.

609
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:27,121
我从"巴特利R" 中摘来的
I found it in my Bartlett's.

610
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:29,121
什么是"巴特利R" ?
What's your Bartlett's?

611
00:44:29,192 --> 00:44:31,091
那是一本语录  帕特里克
It's a quote book, Patrick.

612
00:44:31,162 --> 00:44:33,061
充满各种名言警句
It's a book of quotations.

613
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:35,620
我想医生有一天也会上"巴特利R" 的
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.

614
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:37,630
-肯定  -医生他说的都是名言
Definitely. Howard is pure Bartlett's.

615
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:40,070
上帝
God!

616
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:42,700
我们这样会吵醒他吗?
Can you wake him up?

617
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:44,710
不会
You can't wake him up.

618
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,269
你什么都不跟我讲  乔尔
You don't tell me things, Joel.

619
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,749
我是一本打开的书
I'm an open book.

620
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,919
我什么都告诉你
I tell you everything.

621
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:06,218
甚至是每一件丢人的事
Every damn embarrassing thing.

622
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:10,918
你不信任我
You don't trust me.

623
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:14,528
不断说话并不是必要的交流方式
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.

624
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:18,958
我没有那样做
I don't do that.

625
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:23,427
我想了解你更深
I want to know you.

626
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:29,637
我没有不断说话!
I don't constantly talk. Jesus!

627
00:45:31,518 --> 00:45:33,677
你必须把有些事拿出来分享  乔尔
People have to share things, Joel.

628
00:45:35,757 --> 00:45:37,846
那才是亲密无间
That's what intimacy is.

629
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:40,856
你那样对我说  真让我生气
I'm really pissed thatyou said that to me.

630
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:42,856
对不起
I'm sorry.

631
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:45,916
只是我的生活很无趣
It just really just isn't that interesting.

632
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:50,066
我想看看你一直在写的备忘录
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.

633
00:45:50,136 --> 00:45:53,295
你在里面写了什么  如果你不再有想法、激情
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions

634
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,365
或爱的话?
or love?

635
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:07,245
2003年11月19日
November 19, 2003.

636
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:09,974
又在中餐馆进餐
Dinner at Kang's again.

637
00:46:12,385 --> 00:46:15,324
我们像在这餐馆中的可怜伴侣们吗?
Are we like those poor couples

638
00:46:15,395 --> 00:46:18,124
你为他们感到难过
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

639
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,564
我们都是在进餐的行尸走肉吗?
Are we the dining dead?

640
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:25,323
我受不了我们那样想别人
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.

641
00:46:29,304 --> 00:46:31,743
我喜欢那样
I like that.

642
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:35,013
鸡肉好吃吗?
How's the chicken?

643
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:37,062
好吃
Good.

644
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:41,452
-再来点?  -不要了  谢谢
More? No. No. Thank you.

645
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:46,922
她会喝醉然后变得愚笨
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.

646
00:46:46,993 --> 00:46:49,422
你能帮个忙
Hey, would you do me a favor

647
00:46:49,492 --> 00:46:52,461
把你洗澡时留在肥皂上的  脏头发弄干净吗?
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?

648
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:54,461
-好的  -那有一点
Yeah. It's really

649
00:46:54,532 --> 00:46:56,621
-恶心  -恶心
- Gross. - gross.

650
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:01,421
-那只是  -讨厌的
-It's just -Repulsive.

651
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:03,161
讨厌的
It's repulsive.

652
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:11,600
帕特里克  我们能不能专心完成这个?
Patrick, can we get through this?

653
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:13,440
帕特里克
Patrick.

654
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:15,450
嗨  橘子
Hey, Tangerine.

655
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:18,640
帕特里克  是你
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

656
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:20,980
我现在很痛苦
I'm so miserable right now.

657
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:23,449
-为什么?  出了什么事?  -我不知道
-Why? What's wrong? -I don 't know.

658
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,459
-什么?  -我感到非常迷惑
-Excuse me? -I'm so confused!

659
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,459
我能帮你找什么书吗  先生?
Can I help you fiind something, sir?

660
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,519
迷惑?  你对什么感到迷惑  一切都好啊
Confused? What are you confused about? Everything's fine.

661
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,459
宝贝  过来
Baby, come here.

662
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,519
你在害怕什么?
Scared of what?

663
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,628
-你爱我吗?  -当然爱
Do you love me? of course I do.

664
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:44,638
系统的自我帮助区在哪里?
Where's the self-help section?

665
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:47,178
你认为我丑吗?
Do you think I'm ugly?

666
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:49,678
不  你很漂亮
No! You're beautiful!

667
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:52,008
-也许我该过来  -不  不
Maybe I should come over. No, no.

668
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,017
我不知道  我现在一团糟  帕特里克
I don't know. I'm a mess, Patrick.

669
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:57,777
让我来吧  我会让你高兴
Well, just let me come over. I'll cheer you up.

670
00:47:57,858 --> 00:47:59,717
好的
Okay.

671
00:47:59,788 --> 00:48:02,987
斯坦  我能离开一会儿吗?  我女友真的不高兴了
Stan, can I leave for a while? My girlfriend's really upset.

672
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:05,257
我们正在清除这可怜人的记忆中
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's--

673
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:07,257
让他走吧  斯坦!
Let him go, Stan!

674
00:48:07,327 --> 00:48:10,266
让他走吧  我来帮忙
Let him go. I'll help.

675
00:48:10,337 --> 00:48:12,266
看到了吗?  这能有多难?
See? How hard can it be?

676
00:48:12,337 --> 00:48:16,026
-她讨厌我  她想我离开  -那走吧
-She hates me. She wants me to go. -Go.

677
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:19,006
好的  我这就来  柑橘
All right. I'll be right over, Tangerine.

678
00:48:19,077 --> 00:48:20,766
你喜欢吗?
You like?

679
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:23,906
不错!
Oh, man!

680
00:48:23,976 --> 00:48:25,945
用来配我的运动衫
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

681
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:27,945
-哈 我喜欢 -真的?
-I like it. -You do?

682
00:48:28,016 --> 00:48:30,245
你看上去像个柑橘
You look like a tangerine. Ohh!

683
00:48:30,316 --> 00:48:33,775
克莱门氏小柑橘  汁多!
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine. Juicy!

684
00:48:33,856 --> 00:48:36,345
-而且无核  -我喜欢这称呼
-And seedless. -I like that.

685
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:40,224
我喜欢柑橘
I like tangerines!

686
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:42,454
想看我学鸭叫吗?
Can you see me doing ducks?

687
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:45,434
-柑橘  -约尔  鸭子
Tangerine. Joel. Ducks. Quack-quack.

688
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:48,434
-他怎么知道这称呼?  -谁知道?
-How does he know to call you that? -How did who know?

689
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:51,264
-噢  天啊!  克莱?  -这很酷
-Oh, my God. Clem? -This is pretty,cool.

690
00:48:51,335 --> 00:48:53,274
他们称呼自己为
That's what they called themselves.

691
00:48:53,334 --> 00:48:55,773
"撞击" 他们是唯一重要的乐队
The Clash--the only band that mattered.

692
00:48:55,844 --> 00:48:57,773
他们的名字是有含义的
They called themselves that for a reason.

693
00:48:57,844 --> 00:48:59,523
-真是惊异啊  不是吗?  -社会正气
-It's amazing, isn't it? -Like social justice

694
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:01,213
是的  彻底的了不起
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

695
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:03,803
我在说医生为这世界所作的
What Howard gives to the world.

696
00:49:04,814 --> 00:49:06,913
是的
Yeah.

697
00:49:06,983 --> 00:49:09,422
让人们能重新开始
To let people begin again.

698
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:13,422
这真美丽
It's beautiful.

699
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:18,432
就像看着一个婴儿  如此纯洁、自由和单纯
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.

700
00:49:18,493 --> 00:49:21,932
成年人的生活真是充满悲哀
And adults are like this mess of sadness

701
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:24,792
和恐惧
and phobias.

702
00:49:24,872 --> 00:49:27,931
而医生改变了这一切
Howard just makes it all go away.

703
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,800
天啊!
Oh, my,God.

704
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:44,520
-宝贝  怎么啦?  -我不知道  我不知道!
-Baby, what's going on? -I don't know. I don't know!

705
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:46,990
我感到迷失、害怕
I'm lost, I'm scared,

706
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:48,990
我感觉自己好像在消失
I feel like I'm disappearing.

707
00:49:49,061 --> 00:49:51,990
-消失?  -我皮肤开始松弛!  我在变老!
-Disappearing? -My skin's coming off!. I'm getting old!

708
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:55,000
-一切对我好像都没意义  -你没在变老
-Nothing makes any sense to me! -You're not getting old.

709
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,289
-一切好像都没意义  -噢 柑桔
-Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense. -Ohh, Tangerine.

710
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,659
一切好像都没意义
Nothing makes any sense.

711
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,359
-一切好像都没意义  -没事的  没事的
-Nothing makes any sense, Patrick. It's okay. It's okay.

712
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,469
我们去跳舞吧? 你想和我一起去蒙塔克吗?
Hey, let's go out dancing. You wanna go out to Montaukwith me?

713
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,478
-蒙塔克?
-Montauk?

714
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,238
-不!  和我去波士顿  -当然  下个星期末去
-No! Come up to Boston with me. -Sure. We can go next weekend.

715
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,548
不  就现在  我必须得去
No, no. Now. Now. I have to go now.

716
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,048
我现在必须去看结冰的查尔斯河
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

717
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:26,057
你好  这是乔尔家
Hi, it's Joel.

718
00:50:26,128 --> 00:50:31,327
请在听到信号后留言  我会回复的
Leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.

719
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:35,837
斯坦  快接听
Pick up! Pick up, man!

720
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:38,697
等等 等一等
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

721
00:50:40,777 --> 00:50:43,206
喂  什么事?
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

722
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:46,366
我和这老女士有些问题要处理
I got into a little situation with the old lady.

723
00:50:46,447 --> 00:50:49,206
你能一个人处理那里的事吗?  伙计  真抱歉
Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm really sorry, man.

724
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:52,216
别担心  伙计  一切都在我控制之中
Don't worry about it. I got it under control, man.

725
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,066
-他现在处于自动清除程序之中
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.

726
00:50:54,066 --> 00:50:55,845
-谢谢你  斯坦  我欠你的情
-Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

727
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:58,645
伙计  我得挂了
Dude, I gotta go. I gotta go.

728
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:02,515
查尔斯河
Charles.

729
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,655
来吧  查尔斯河
Come on, Charles.

730
00:51:11,265 --> 00:51:15,604
"你和我在查尔斯河上 我想现在就死去 克莱"
"Look! You and me on the Charles River. I could die right now, Clem.

731
00:51:15,675 --> 00:51:19,874
"我真的很快乐 以前从未如此感受 我现在就在"
I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want"

732
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,504
-我好兴奋! -我也很兴奋!
-I'm so excited. -I'm excited too!

733
00:51:28,514 --> 00:51:31,383
把这个
I got you this

734
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:34,513
-什么?  -送给你
What? thing, um--

735
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:36,523
情人节快乐
Happy early Valentine's Day.

736
00:51:40,023 --> 00:51:42,052
是什么?
What is it?

737
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,622
我不知道  打开看看
I don't know. Open it up.

738
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:54,102
这太棒了!
It's gorgeous!

739
00:51:54,173 --> 00:51:57,112
-你喜欢吗?  -是的  正合我口味
-You like it? -Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

740
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:01,541
我还从未和送我喜欢珠宝的人出去约会
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

741
00:52:01,612 --> 00:52:03,601
谢谢你
Thank you.

742
00:52:10,621 --> 00:52:12,560
-走吧  -好的
-Let's go. -Okay.

743
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:15,890
-乔伊?  -什么  柑桔?
Joely? Yeah, Tangerine?

744
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:20,050
我丑吗?
Am I ugly?

745
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:23,570
当我还是小孩时  我觉得自己很丑
When I was a kid, I thought I was.

746
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,730
真不敢相信我已这么多愁善感了
Can't believe I'm crying already.

747
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:33,639
有时我认为人们不知道  小孩是多么的孤独
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely,it is to be a kid.

748
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,739
就像你感到自己很渺小
Like you don't matter.

749
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:40,149
所以我八岁时
So, I'm eight

750
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,479
我拥有这些玩具
and I have these toys,

751
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:44,488
这些洋娃娃
these dolls.

752
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,288
我最喜欢一个很丑的女洋娃娃  我叫她克莱门汀
My fiavorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.

753
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,288
我不停的对她大喊
And I keep yelling at her:

754
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,698
"你不能这么丑!  变漂亮! "
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

755
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:57,788
这很奇怪
It's weird.

756
00:52:57,868 --> 00:53:00,897
就像如果我可以把她变漂亮
Like if i can transform her,

757
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:03,597
那我也会魔术般的变漂亮
I would magically, change too.

758
00:53:08,348 --> 00:53:10,277
你很漂亮!
You're pretty.

759
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:13,507
乔伊  永远不要离开我
Joely, don't ever leave me.

760
00:53:13,577 --> 00:53:17,606
你很漂亮  很漂亮  很漂亮
Pretty. Pretty. Pretty. Pretty.

761
00:53:17,687 --> 00:53:21,626
米R维克医生  求你让我保留这段回忆
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory..

762
00:53:21,687 --> 00:53:23,626
就这一段
Just this one.

763
00:53:23,697 --> 00:53:26,626
我不想拖着你  来吧!
I don't wanna hold your hand. Come on.

764
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:30,395
停下
Stop it!

765
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,495
我想现在就死去  克莱
I could die right now, Clem.

766
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:39,725
我真的很
I'm just

767
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:43,705
高兴
happy.

768
00:53:45,615 --> 00:53:48,274
我从未如此感受
I've never felt that before.

769
00:53:51,415 --> 00:53:53,404
我现在就在
I'm just exactly

770
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:57,644
我一直想去的地方
where I wanna be.

771
00:53:58,724 --> 00:54:00,713
克莱?
Clem?

772
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:09,423
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off.

773
00:54:09,504 --> 00:54:11,493
我得想办法告诉他们
I'll give you a sign.

774
00:54:15,843 --> 00:54:17,832
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off!.

775
00:54:20,243 --> 00:54:23,182
你听到了吗?  我无法忍受了!
Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore!

776
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:25,612
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off!.

777
00:54:25,683 --> 00:54:29,512
"你不是无事可做"
"When you ain't got nothing to do"

778
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,581
"我想我会娶你"
"I think I'll marry.you"

779
00:54:31,652 --> 00:54:35,421
有人听到了吗?
Is anybody there?

780
00:54:41,832 --> 00:54:44,321
-克莱门汀?  -乔尔!
Clementine? Joel?

781
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:46,630
-克莱  -乔伊?
Clement-- Joely?

782
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,790
-克莱!  -乔尔?
Clem! Joel?

783
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:51,670
克莱!
Clem!

784
00:54:51,741 --> 00:54:53,970
-怎么啦?  -我们得离开
-What? -We gotta go. We gotta go.

785
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,480

-What? Where? -I have an idea of how to stop this.

786
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:58,880
阻止什么?
Stop what?

787
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,879
-乔伊  -来吧  克莱
Joely. Come on, Clem.

788
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:04,249
-闻闻我的腋窝!  -不要!
-Smell my armpit! Smell my armpit! -No!

789
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,879
-不要胳肢我!  不要逼我闻你  -闻我的私处
-Don't tickle me! Don't make me smell you. -Smell my pits!

790
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,889
-不要  -好的
-No. -Good.

791
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,319
集中精神  克莱
Concentrate, Clem.

792
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,879
我们得回到医生的办公室去
We gotta get back to the offiice.

793
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:16,488
那里有个盒式录音机  不  不是那幅画!
There was a tape recorder. No, not the picture.

794
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,588
不是那幅画!
Not the picture.

795
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:21,728
在哪里?  这边走  来吧!
Where is it? Back here. Come on!

796
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:24,468
噢  看着我  我在那里看上很好
Oh, look at me. Hey, I look good there.

797
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:28,238
客户的档案是保密的  巴瑞斯先生
Look our files are confiidential, Mr. Barish,

798
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:30,238
我不能给你看
so I can't show you evidence.

799
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:33,707
这样说吧  克莱门汀女士
Suffiice it to say, that Miss, uh-- Miss Kruczynski

800
00:55:33,778 --> 00:55:37,647
她觉得很不快乐  她想要新的生活

801
00:55:37,718 --> 00:55:42,247
-现在告诉我关于克莱门汀的事  -所有你记得的事
Good. Now, tell me about Clementine. Just tell me everything you remember.

808
00:55:57,837 --> 00:56:00,806
-我们总是得逃吗?  -米R维克医生!
Do we always have to run? Mierzwiak!

809
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:12,115
求求你
Please.

810
00:56:12,186 --> 00:56:15,545
那么  为什么我们不从
So, why don't we begin by you telling me

811
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,714
你所记得的一切开始
everything you can remember.

812
00:56:17,785 --> 00:56:20,274
米R维克医生!  让我醒来!
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

813
00:56:20,355 --> 00:56:23,384
对不起  巴瑞斯先生
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

814
00:56:23,455 --> 00:56:26,454
我想你知道所有这一切的原因
I thought you understood what was going on here.

815
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:29,694
你不知道  你在消除我对她的记忆
I don't know. You're erasing her from me.

816
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:32,704
你在消除她
You're erasing me from her--

817
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:37,173
我不知道
I don't know.

818
00:56:37,244 --> 00:56:40,903
你是做这事的  我知道  我现在躺在自己床上
You've got this thing. I'm in my bed. I know it.

819
00:56:40,974 --> 00:56:42,913
我在我自己的回忆中
I'm in my brain.

820
00:56:42,974 --> 00:56:45,883
我也是你想象的一部分  乔尔
I'm part of your imagination too,Joel.

821
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:48,572
我不能帮你什么
How can I help you from there?

822
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:52,142
我也在你的大脑里  我就是你!
Uh, I'm inside your head too. I'm you.

823
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:55,852
抱歉
Sorry..

824
00:56:55,923 --> 00:56:57,982
瞧!  那是谁?
Look. Who's that?

825
00:56:58,063 --> 00:57:00,112
他是我们的员工
Oh, he-he works for us.

826
00:57:00,193 --> 00:57:04,862
他是帕特里克!
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

827
00:57:04,932 --> 00:57:07,521
宝贝男孩
baby boy.

828
00:57:07,602 --> 00:57:10,091
他偷了我的身份
He's stealing my identity.

829
00:57:10,172 --> 00:57:12,571
他偷了我的东西
He stole my stuff.

830
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:16,331
他用我的语言和事物去引诱我的爱人
He's seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.

831
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:19,600
-他还偷了她的内裤
He stole her underwear.

832
00:57:19,681 --> 00:57:21,610
他偷了她的内裤
He stole her underwear.

833
00:57:21,681 --> 00:57:25,080
我想现在就死去  克莱
I could die right now, Clem.

834
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,620
我真的很高兴
I'm just happy.

835
00:57:27,691 --> 00:57:32,280
我从未如此感受  我现在就在自己一直想去的地方
I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.

836
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,819
我想回家了
I want to go home.

837
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,859
什么?
Hey. What?

838
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,929
克莱!
Clem!

839
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,989
等等  克莱!
Wait. Clem!

840
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:50,268
克莱?
Clem?

841
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:52,808
他们在清除你
They,'re erasing you.

842
00:57:52,879 --> 00:57:54,808
我在这儿!
I'm here!

843
00:57:54,879 --> 00:57:57,538
克莱  集中精神  他们是我雇的
Clem, focus. I hired them, okay?

844
00:57:57,619 --> 00:57:59,548
对不起  我真愚蠢!
I'm so stupid.

845
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:02,638
宝贝  冷静下来  观赏美景
Sweetie, calm down. Enjoy the scenery.

846
00:58:02,718 --> 00:58:06,047
在我醒来完全忘掉你之前  我得阻止他们
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.

847
00:58:07,688 --> 00:58:11,917
那好  直接叫他们取消手术
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.

848
00:58:11,998 --> 00:58:15,227
你在说什么?  我做不到  我现在是睡着的
What the hell are you talking about? I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

849
00:58:15,298 --> 00:58:17,057
那就把自己叫醒!
Wake yourself up!

850
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,896
那好  你想我自己醒过来  好的
Okay. You want me to wake up? Okay. Great. All right.

851
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:22,866
来试试看  我这样能不能让你高兴?
Okay, here we go. This make you happy if I try? Yeah.

852
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:25,966
我尽力试试 开始了  这真是个好主意
I'll try really hard. Here we go. That was a great idea.

853
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:31,476
这还真是有效
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.

854
00:58:31,547 --> 00:58:34,066
-不要!  那让我很痒!  -我的天
Don't! That tickles me! Oh, my, goodness.

855
00:58:34,146 --> 00:58:36,585
-天  那是什么?  -天 那是
Oh, my, God. What is that? Jesus Christ! What the--

856
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,585
是个胎记!
It's a birthmark!

857
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:45,155
这的确有用但只一会儿
It did work, for a second,

858
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:47,745
-但我动不了  -看到了?
-but I couldn't-- I couldn't move. See?

859
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:52,494
那是另一个乔尔预言吗?
Well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

860
00:58:52,565 --> 00:58:54,894
用来证明我的主意是错的
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually.

861
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:58,134
我不想谈这个  好吗?
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?

862
00:58:58,205 --> 00:59:01,534
好的
Fine.

863
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:04,594
接下来怎么办?  我在听着
Then what? I'm listening.

864
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,373
-我也不知道  -你先清除了我
I don't know. You erased me.

865
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:10,103
所以我才会作这个清除术
That's why I'm here. That's why I'm doing this in the first place.

866
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:12,113
-对不起  -你真是!
I'm sorry. You-- You!

867
00:59:12,184 --> 00:59:14,613
你了解我  我很冲动
You know me. I'm impulsive.

868
00:59:17,924 --> 00:59:20,013
那就是为什么我爱你
That's what I love aboutyou.

869
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,322
乔尔?
Joel?

870
00:59:25,393 --> 00:59:28,362
我有另一个解决问题的方法
I have anotheridea forthis problem.

871
00:59:28,433 --> 00:59:30,692
现在我是你的回忆
This is a memory of me, The way

872
00:59:30,773 --> 00:59:35,462
当你看到我的胯部  你就想和我在沙发上做爱
you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.

873
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:38,471
-什么?  -乔尔  那些人会找到这里
What? Joel, the eraser guys are coming here,

874
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:41,531
为什么你不把我带到其它的地方去?
so what if you take me somewhere else,

875
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:43,771
其它没有我的回忆中
somewhere where I don't belong,

876
00:59:43,842 --> 00:59:46,401
我们藏在那里  直到明早
and we hide there till morning?

877
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:54,220
该死  我记不起其它没有你的地方
Oh, man. I can't remember anything without you.

878
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:57,450
那话真甜  但尽力试试  好吗?
Tsk, that's very sweet, but try, okay?

879
00:59:57,531 --> 00:59:59,460
我试试
Okay.

880
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,878
有效了!
It's working!

881
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:29,508
我真是天才!
I'm a genius!

882
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:51,936
乔尔?
Joel?

883
01:00:52,007 --> 01:00:54,206
乔尔?
Joel?

884
01:00:55,947 --> 01:00:58,106
你去哪儿呢?
Where'd you go?

885
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,976
我应该和你一起去的!
I'm supposed to come too!

886
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:01,816
我得去拿一个色拉盘
Listen, I'm just gonna go get a salad bowl.

887
01:01:01,817 --> 01:01:03,576
你能看好汤和照顾乔尔吗?
Can you stir the soup and keep an eye on Joel?

888
01:01:03,657 --> 01:01:05,586
-他喜欢在我身边  -当然
Sure. He just likes to be near me.

889
01:01:05,656 --> 01:01:07,625
克莱?
Absolutely! Clem?

890
01:01:07,696 --> 01:01:11,855
成功了!  天  看看这个!
It worked. My, God, look at this!

891
01:01:11,926 --> 01:01:16,095
成功了!  天  看看这身衣服!
It worked! Look! Look at this dress, man!

892
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:20,725
天啊  看看!  我能带走这件衣服吗?
Oh, my God! Look at it! I wish I could take it with me.

893
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:23,204
我是谁?
Who am I?

894
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:25,174
-是哈姆林女士  -是的  哈姆林女士
Mrs. Hamlyn. Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

895
01:01:25,245 --> 01:01:27,804
这是我四岁时的回忆  啊  糟了!
I must be about four. Oh, my gosh.

896
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:31,174
找到沙拉盘了 今晚主菜是菜豆与沙拉
Found the salad bowl, so I'm serving salad and string beans.

897
01:01:31,245 --> 01:01:33,734
他在那下面好吧 你怎么样?
Is he okay under there? Peanut, are you all right?

898
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:37,514
上帝  我感觉自己可以一天到晚都做家务
God, honestly, I feel like I could clean up all day.

899
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:39,113
-不介意我叫你清洗菜豆吧?
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you to clean some string beans?

900
01:01:39,114 --> 01:01:40,643
-不  当然不
-No, not at all.

901
01:01:40,724 --> 01:01:43,243
天  我爱死这厨房了!
Oh, my God. I love this kitchen.

902
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:46,313
-非常感谢  -她看都不看我
Thank you so much. She's not looking at me.

903
01:01:46,394 --> 01:01:49,523
她很忙  她看都不看我
She's busy. She's not looking at me.

904
01:01:49,594 --> 01:01:52,933
没有人愿意看我  我想要妈妈
No one ever looks at me. I want my mommy.

905
01:01:53,003 --> 01:01:55,992
乔伊宝贝. 嘿,乔伊!乔伊!
Oh, baby, Joel. Hey, Joely! Joely,!

906
01:01:56,073 --> 01:01:58,592
-他在下面还好吗? -嗯 还好
Is every Iittle peanut under there okay? Mm-hmm! He's fine.

907
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,002
你有什么可喝吗?
Do you have something to drink?

908
01:02:01,073 --> 01:02:03,732
想喝杯鸡尾酒吗?  现在还没到五点
Would you drink a cocktail at this hour? I mean, I know it's not 5:00.

909
01:02:03,813 --> 01:02:06,302
-有伏特加酒就好了  -等等  我去看看有没有
I would die for a vodka. Oh, hang on. Let me check if I have that.

910
01:02:06,382 --> 01:02:09,111
好的  我在这儿等  乔尔
Okay! I'm just gonna wait right here. Joel!

911
01:02:09,182 --> 01:02:11,111
呃，乔伊
Uh,Joely.

912
01:02:11,182 --> 01:02:14,811
-你妈妈要我照看你  回到桌下去 -我要冰淇淋
Your mother wants me to mind you. Get back underthe table. Ice cream.

913
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:19,251
-冰淇淋  -不  那要到你吃完饭后
Ice cream. No, not until after you know you've had your dinner.

914
01:02:19,322 --> 01:02:21,351
乔尔  来吧!
Come on, Joel!

915
01:02:21,432 --> 01:02:23,361
乔尔  快长大!
Joel, grow up!

916
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:25,790
不要离开我  克莱
Don't leave me, Clem. Oh, my God, Clem.

917
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:28,300
这有点不对劲  我害怕
This is sort of warped. I'm scared.

918
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:31,660
-我要妈妈  -不要哭  乔尔宝贝
I want my mommy! Don't cry, baby Joel.

919
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:36,040

Baby Joel, it's okay. Joel.

920
01:02:36,111 --> 01:02:38,900
乔尔!  别哭了!  看着我!  我想这有效果了
Stop it! Look, I think it's working. Look, we're hidden, Joel.

921
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,809
宝贝  看着
Hey, honey, look.

922
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,869
待着别动
Wait there.

923
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,979
我的胯部还在  就像你回忆中的一样
My crotch is still here just as you remembered it.

924
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:51,989
讨厌!
Yuck.

925
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:58,148
停了
It stopped.

926
01:02:58,229 --> 01:03:01,958
-什么?  -清除停止了
What? It stopped erasing.

927
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:06,528
这太糟了!
This is terrible.

928
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:10,367
他到映像外面去了
He's offthe map. He's off the map.

929
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:12,217
-他去哪儿呢? -不知道
Where? I don't know where!

930
01:03:12,218 --> 01:03:13,997
你是什么意思 我不知道他到哪儿去了!
What do you mean? I don't know where!

931
01:03:14,078 --> 01:03:18,167
这很糟 太糟了! 我眼镜在哪儿?
This is bad. This is very, very bad news. Where are my glasses?

932
01:03:18,248 --> 01:03:20,807
好了 糟糕
Okay. Crap.

933
01:03:20,878 --> 01:03:23,647
我们该怎么办? 我该怎么办?
Okay. What do we do? What do I do?

934
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,276
-我们该做些什么? -不知道 不知道
What shall we do? I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

-我们该做些什么? -我不知道 别说了 好吗?
- What shall we do? - Crap. Crap. I don't know!

936
01:03:28,657 --> 01:03:31,286
-我说了我不知道 -对不起 我们该做些什么?
- I just said that I don't know what to do. - I'm sorry. What do we do?

937
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:34,956
我不知道 你在烦我 放松些
I don't know. Now, look,you're freaking me out. Mellow out.

938
01:03:35,027 --> 01:03:38,866
但你必须得做点什么 他不能半途中醒来
Well, you have to do something. He could wake up all half-baked.

939
01:03:38,936 --> 01:03:41,955
安静 你快把我逼疯了
Quiet. You're freaking me out. Shh. Shh.

940
01:03:42,036 --> 01:03:45,025
全部黏糊糊的而且只烤到一半，嗯，那听起来真酷!
All gooey and-- and half-baked. Hmm, that sounds so good.

941
01:03:45,106 --> 01:03:47,035
-糟糕! -我饿了
Oh, shit! I'm hungry.

942
01:03:47,106 --> 01:03:49,045
糟糕!
Oh, shit. Oh! Oh!

943
01:03:49,106 --> 01:03:51,575
什么? 什么? 什么?
What? Oh! What, what? What?

944
01:03:51,646 --> 01:03:54,575
-我们应该把医生叫过来 -不 不要
- We should call Howard. - No way. No, sir, man.

945
01:03:54,645 --> 01:03:56,804
这是我的工作 我能处理
This is my-- I can handle this.

946
01:03:56,885 --> 01:03:59,184
-我们不能麻烦他 -他的手术只作了一半
I can't call Howard. He's an unbaked cookie.

947
01:03:59,255 --> 01:04:01,944
没时间胡闹了
He's-- There's no time to fuck around.

948
01:04:02,025 --> 01:04:04,514
-一切都在我的控制之中  -不要瞎说了
I got this under control. What Are you talking about?

949
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:07,454
-不要胡闹了  -好吧  我打电话给他
Stop fucking around! Okay, I'll call Howard.

950
01:04:15,204 --> 01:04:18,563
-喂  是霍华德吗?  我是斯坦
Hello, Howard? Hey, it's Stan.

951
01:04:18,634 --> 01:04:20,473
我正在做手术的这个人
I'm working on this guy down here

952
01:04:20,534 --> 01:04:22,473
我们在一段时间内没有他的信号了
and we seem to have lost him for a moment,

953
01:04:22,544 --> 01:04:25,303
而且我无法找到他
and, uh, I can't-- I can't bring him back up.

954
01:04:25,373 --> 01:04:28,812
告诉我在信号消失前发生了什么
Okay, tell me what happened before he disappeared.

955
01:04:28,883 --> 01:04:32,282
我不太肯定  我离开了一会
Well, I wasn't sure, really, cause I was away from the monitor for a minute.

956
01:04:32,353 --> 01:04:35,042
那段时间用的是自动程序
and I had it on autopilot because I had to,

957
01:04:35,123 --> 01:04:37,052
我得上厕所
I had to pee.

958
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,812
-帕特里克在哪儿?  -帕特里克生病回家了
Where's Patrick? Patrick? Patrick had to go home sick.

959
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:45,651
-好的  告诉我地址  -真对不起
Okay, what's the address? I know. I'm so sorry.

960
01:04:45,732 --> 01:04:49,421
-快说吧  -南村街159号
That's okay. Come on. I'm at 159 South Village.

961
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:52,661
-好的  -公寓单元1E  洛克威尔中心
Yeah. Apartment 1E. Rockville Center.

962
01:04:52,732 --> 01:04:55,401
-玛丽  他马上就到  -什么?
Mary? He's coming right now. Yeah?

963
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:57,400
我会留下来
I'm staying.

964
01:04:57,471 --> 01:04:59,840
-收拾好你的东西  玛丽  -我要留下
-Get your stuff, Mary. -I'm staying.

965
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:02,400
-我想你应该离开  -不要
I thinkyou should go. Hell, no.

966
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:06,070
玛丽  真糟糕!
Mary-- Shit.

967
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:10,140
-我烂醉了  -不要  玛丽
I am so stoned. Please, Mary.

968
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,579
-你得离开  -我得醒酒  玛丽
You have to go. Stop being stoned, Mary.

969
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,449
我不想他看到我醉酒的样子
I don't want him to see me stoned.

970
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,599
-玛丽  你知不知道我们会有什么样的麻烦
Mary. you have no idea how much trouble we're gonna get into

971
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,689
-我看上去真糟!
if Howard comes. I look like shit!

972
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,959
乔伊 不要! 乔尔 看!
Joely, stop it! Joel! Look! Hey, Joel!

973
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:30,858
-乔尔!  -我想她来看我
Joel! I want her to pick me up.

974
01:05:30,939 --> 01:05:34,468
-奇怪 那欲望是这么的强烈 -乔尔 看着我 看着我!
It's weird how strong that desire is. Joel, look at me! Look.

975
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:36,868
早上醒来时你还会记得我
You'll remember me in the morning,

976
01:05:36,939 --> 01:05:40,108
你来找我把我们的事告诉我  我们重新开始
and you'll come to me and you'll tell me about us, and we'll start over.

977
01:05:40,179 --> 01:05:42,548
帕特?  我刚帕特?
Pat? I just-- Pat?

978
01:05:42,618 --> 01:05:44,777
我想我们可以来点鸡尾酒
I thought we could have a little cocktail.

979
01:05:44,848 --> 01:05:47,317
那个叫帕特里克的家伙  他在模仿我
That Patrick guy-- he's copying me.

980
01:05:47,388 --> 01:05:49,377
帕特里克?
What Patrick guy?

981
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,217
-那个家伙!  -什么?
That guy! What?

982
01:05:51,288 --> 01:05:53,157
他在我的家里
He's here in my apartment.

983
01:05:53,228 --> 01:05:55,157
他也是做清除术的人
He's one of those eraser guys.

984
01:05:55,228 --> 01:05:57,397
他在为你做手术时爱上了你
He fell for you when they were doing you,

985
01:05:57,397 --> 01:05:59,556
现在他向你介绍自己  好像他从来不认识你
and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you,

986
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:01,966
现在你们在约会
and you guys are dating.

987
01:06:02,037 --> 01:06:05,266
真的吗?  他可爱吗?
Really? Is he cute?

988
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:10,066
克莱  你没事的
Clem, there's nothing wrong with you.

989
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,736
你是我遇到过的最好的人
You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

990
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:15,745
你你很善良
You-- You're kind,

991
01:06:15,816 --> 01:06:18,045
美丽
beautiful

992
01:06:18,116 --> 01:06:20,345
聪明、幽默
and smart and funny

993
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:22,645
而且人好
and nice.

994
01:06:22,716 --> 01:06:24,945
什么?
What?

995
01:06:26,185 --> 01:06:28,624
好了
Okay. All right.

996
01:06:30,155 --> 01:06:32,454
好了
Okay. Oh!

997
01:06:32,525 --> 01:06:34,824
-快点 快点 来吧 -小心些
Move, move, move! Come on. Let's go. Careful, careful.

998
01:06:34,895 --> 01:06:36,694
好的
Fine.

999
01:06:36,765 --> 01:06:40,164
天  我还醉着
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1000
01:06:40,235 --> 01:06:42,634
你给我的眼药水屁用没有
Those eyedrops you gave me didn't do shit.

1001
01:06:47,374 --> 01:06:49,313
冷静  冷静
Be cool. Cool.

1002
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,183
-玛丽 你怎么在这里? -嗯 霍华德
Hello, Mary. What are you doing here? Oh, hi, Howard.

1003
01:06:56,254 --> 01:06:58,183
她只是过来帮忙
She was just here to help out.

1004
01:06:58,253 --> 01:07:01,412
我想尽力理解整个过程
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.

1005
01:07:01,493 --> 01:07:05,182
我想这对我的工作很重要
I think it's important for my job to understand the inner workings

1006
01:07:05,263 --> 01:07:07,452
理解这工作中的细节
of the work that we do.

1007
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,222
这工作不是我做的
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done

1008
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:13,992
而是与我共事的人所作的
by people where I also work, the work of my colleagues.

1009
01:07:14,062 --> 01:07:17,091
好了  让我们来看看
All right, well, let's see If we can,

1010
01:07:17,172 --> 01:07:19,731
怎样解决吧
get to the bottom of this, shall we?

1011
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,791
好的
Uh, yeah.

1012
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:27,011
-这很奇怪  -我已试过了
Well, that's odd. I already tried that.

1013
01:07:27,082 --> 01:07:30,841
-你试过C门了吗?  -当然试过了
Did you try going through the C-gate? Yeah, of course.

1014
01:07:30,911 --> 01:07:32,710
我的意思是是的
I mean yes.

1015
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:35,010
好的
Yeah.

1016
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:39,160
那么
All right.

1017
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:42,630
-你想连上去么?  -是的
You want to get linked up? Yeah.

1018
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:44,989
好的
All right.

1019
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,689
我已经使用了检查程序
I already-- I ran the utility programs,

1020
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,759
但并没找到什么
and I had nothing there,

1021
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,829
所以我根据打印日志检查了所有的记忆扫描
so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.

1022
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,889
霍华德
Here, Howard. Okay.

1023
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,369
-请坐  -谢谢你
I got you a chair. There you go. Oh, Thank you.

1024
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,999
不用谢
You're welcome. Whew!

1025
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,668
好的  我会检查他所有的记忆
All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go through the entire memory,

1026
01:08:03,749 --> 01:08:05,738
看看是怎么回事
see if something comes up.

1027
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:12,418
我亲爱的 我亲爱的克莱门汀
Oh my darling, oh my darling,Oh my darling Clementine

1028
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,978
我喜欢在水槽里洗澡
I love being bathed in the sink.

1029
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:17,547
这感觉是多么的安全
Such a feeling of security.

1030
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:20,857
我从来没见你这么高兴  乔尔宝贝
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.

1031
01:08:20,928 --> 01:08:22,867
在这儿
There it is.

1032
01:08:22,928 --> 01:08:27,267
我不能理解他怎么会跑到映像之外?
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.

1033
01:08:27,338 --> 01:08:29,397
他到底在那里干什么?
What the heck was he doing there?

1034
01:08:38,977 --> 01:08:40,966
他的眼晴睁开了
His eyes are open.

1035
01:08:42,847 --> 01:08:46,446
-以前睁开过吗?  -没有
-Has this happened before with him?  -No.

1036
01:08:46,516 --> 01:08:50,075
这不太妙
Oh, this is-- this is not good. No.

1037
01:08:50,156 --> 01:08:52,385
我不得不
I'm gonna have to--

1038
01:08:52,456 --> 01:08:54,395
给他注射这个
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1039
01:09:18,814 --> 01:09:21,443
难道你不知道吗?  我爱你
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1040
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,683
好的  正常了
Okay, we're back in.

1041
01:09:24,754 --> 01:09:28,983
干得真漂亮  霍华德
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.

1042
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:33,083
就像外科手术或音乐会的钢琴师
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.

1043
01:09:33,163 --> 01:09:35,092
谢谢  玛丽
Thank you, Mary.

1044
01:09:35,163 --> 01:09:39,262
霍华德  你该去睡睡  我想我能处理了
Howard, you should get some sleep. I think I'll be fine now.

1045
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:43,902
但难道你不知道吗?  我爱你  安托万
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1046
01:09:43,973 --> 01:09:45,962
我真幸运
Lucky me.

1047
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:50,441
来亲我吧
Lay one on me.

1048
01:09:51,582 --> 01:09:53,711
别叫我安托万
Don't call me Antoine.

1049
01:09:53,782 --> 01:09:56,181
-我的名字是娃利  -我知道
My name is Wally. Yes, I know,

1050
01:09:56,252 --> 01:09:58,811
但如果男人的名字叫娃利  哪个女人会爱呢?
but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?

1051
01:09:58,892 --> 01:10:01,291
那是什么?
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1052
01:10:01,361 --> 01:10:04,050
天啊  有人从你的屁股后冒出来
Hey. My God, there's people coming out of your butt.

1053
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:06,620
是吗?
There is?

1054
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:10,230
-找到了  -橘柑!
- Got it. - Tangerine!

1055
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:13,320
-乔尔  你在干什么?  -我们得赶快走!
What, Joel-- What are you doing? We gotta go.

1056
01:10:13,401 --> 01:10:16,060
请快走  快走!
Go on. Please, please go. Please go!

1057
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,799
你可以跑  但你躲藏不了
You can run but you can't hide.

1058
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:22,669
克莱  快跑!
Clem, come on!

1059
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:25,639
到了
There I am.

1060
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,649
那卡车!
That truck.

1061
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,619
医生  求求你
Doc? Please.

1062
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,809
好吧  让我们从你所
All right, let's begin by you telling me

1063
01:10:34,889 --> 01:10:37,648
记得的所有事开始
everything you remember--

1064
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:41,628
这真奇怪  他还有已经清除掉了的记忆
That's strange. He's in a memory that we've already erased.

1065
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:45,758
好吧 至少我们知道他在那里 可以追踪他了 对吧?
Oh, well, at least we know where he is. He's back on track, right?

1066
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:47,768
来吧  克莱
Come on, Clem.

1067
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:50,857
看起来他好像在反抗这个过程
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.

1068
01:10:50,938 --> 01:10:53,527
-我不想再跑了  -糟了!
I don't want to run any,more. Shit.

1069
01:10:55,578 --> 01:10:59,137
来吧 把我藏到更深的地方去 埋藏起来
Come on, come on. Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.

1070
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:01,937

01:20:03,082 --> 01:20:05,021
你已经拥有过了
You did.

1203
01:20:13,531 --> 01:20:15,520
她说什么?
What?

1204
01:20:26,341 --> 01:20:29,930
我们以前已经爱过了
we have a history.

1205
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:32,569
抱歉  当时是你想要作清除术
I'm sorry. Y-You wanted the procedure.

1206
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:34,809
你
You--

1207
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,369
你当时想要清除掉记忆
You wanted it done

1208
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:40,749
那么你就可以克服
so you could get past,

1209
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:50,888
我还得去完成工作
I have to, uh, finish the work in there.

1210
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:52,958
天快亮了
It's almost morning.

1211
01:20:54,169 --> 01:20:56,158
我们以后再谈
We'll talk later.

1212
01:20:57,169 --> 01:20:59,098
好吗?
Okay?

1213
01:21:15,957 --> 01:21:17,946
让我送你回家吧
Let me give you a lift home.

1214
01:21:27,527 --> 01:21:30,086
该死  怎么回事?
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1215
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:33,755
-你好  -你好
Hi. Hi.

1216
01:21:33,836 --> 01:21:37,775
我没想到你还会来见我
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.

1217
01:21:37,836 --> 01:21:41,075
我猜你感到羞耻
I guess I thought you were humiliated.

1218
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,115
毕竟你逃跑了
You did run away after all.

1219
01:21:43,176 --> 01:21:45,945
我只是想看看你
I just needed to see you.

1220
01:21:46,015 --> 01:21:48,314
什么?
Yeah?

1221
01:21:48,385 --> 01:21:51,114
我想
I'd like to,

1222
01:21:51,185 --> 01:21:54,154
带你出去逛逛或干点什么
take you out or something.

1223
01:21:54,225 --> 01:21:56,784
你已结婚了
You're married.

1224
01:21:56,855 --> 01:21:59,294
还没  我没结婚
Not yet. Not married.

1225
01:21:59,364 --> 01:22:01,293
不  我没结婚
No, I'm not married, no.

1226
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:04,383
瞧 伙计 我现在就告诉你 我的要求很高
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1227
01:22:04,464 --> 01:22:09,023
我不会做你的情妇
so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage

1228
01:22:09,104 --> 01:22:11,433
或什么第三者
or whatever it is you've got going there.

1229
01:22:11,504 --> 01:22:14,633
如果你想作我的恋人  就只能是我一个
if you wanna be with me, you're with me.

1230
01:22:14,703 --> 01:22:16,872
好的
Okay.

1231
01:22:16,943 --> 01:22:19,842
很多男孩认为我是一个完美的概念
Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them,

1232
01:22:19,913 --> 01:22:22,712
我使他们感到完整或真正的活着
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1233
01:22:22,783 --> 01:22:26,412
但我只是一个寻找内心宁静的混乱女孩
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1234
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:31,152
-别把你的想法强加给我  -我很清楚的记得这话
Don't assign me yours. I remember that speech really well.

1235
01:22:31,222 --> 01:22:34,711
-我让你记住我了吧?  -你让全人类都记住你了
I had you pegged didn't I? You had the whole human race pegged.

1236
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:36,781
也许吧
Hmm. Probably.

1237
01:22:38,962 --> 01:22:41,261
我仍然认为你会回来拯救我的一生
I still thought you were gonna save my life,

1238
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:43,271
即便我们都忘记了彼此
even after that.

1239
01:22:43,332 --> 01:22:46,731
我知道的
I know.

1240
01:22:49,071 --> 01:22:51,060
一切都会不同的
It would be different

1241
01:22:52,211 --> 01:22:54,610
如果我们能再有一个机会
If we could just give it another go around.

1242
01:22:58,581 --> 01:23:00,950
记住我
Remember me.

1243
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,009
尽你的最大努力
Try your best.

1244
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,289
也许我们能够做到
Maybe we can.

1245
01:23:38,548 --> 01:23:41,487
好了  告诉我你还记得些什么
Okay, so just tell me what you remember,

1246
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:44,147
我们会把它清除掉
and, uh, then we'll take it from there.

1247
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:46,457
好的
Okay.

1248
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:49,426
我对你一见钟情
I liked you immediately.

1249
01:23:49,497 --> 01:23:51,986
但你却不解风情
You didn't come on to me at all.

1250
01:23:52,067 --> 01:23:55,056
我喜欢那样
I liked that.

1251
01:23:55,137 --> 01:23:58,106
起初 在你身边我连话都说不出来
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.

1252
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,836
我只是想让你觉得我很聪明
I wanted you to think I was smart.

1253
01:24:02,036 --> 01:24:04,375
我迫不及待想和你工作
I couldn't wait to come to work.

1254
01:24:04,446 --> 01:24:07,935
我幻想我们结婚
I had these fantasies of us being married

1255
01:24:08,016 --> 01:24:11,375
抚养小孩 只是
and having kids and just--

1256
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:14,145
哦  我不能这么做
Oh, I can't do this.

1257
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:16,815
我们都同意这样做是最好的  玛丽
We agreed it's forthe best, Mary..

1258
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,354
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

1259
01:24:19,425 --> 01:24:21,354
天啊!
Oh, God.

1260
01:24:21,695 --> 01:24:23,784
-我来拿底部  -不 不
I'll take the bottom and you-- No, no, no. Here.

1261
01:24:23,865 --> 01:24:25,794
-我搬得动  -你想我拿那个吗?
I can take that. So you want me to carry that?

1262
01:24:25,865 --> 01:24:28,354
-帮我一把  -亲爱的  你能拿螺旋桨吗?
Help me with that. Can you get the cooler? Honey, the cooler is--

1263
01:24:28,435 --> 01:24:31,024
-那很轻 - 让我来搬
That's light, huh? Oh, I can get that. You can get it.

1264
01:24:31,105 --> 01:24:33,034
不 不
No, no, no, no!

1265
01:24:33,104 --> 01:24:35,263
-不要动任何东西  -我可以拿那飞机
Don't take anything. I can take the plane.

1266
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:38,333
把东西收拾好  关上车门
Put the thing up. Put the gate back up.

1267
01:24:40,574 --> 01:24:43,303
这是我们初遇的那天
This is the day,we met.

1268
01:24:43,384 --> 01:24:46,573
你站在海浪前  我就在远方画着你
You were down by the surf. I could just make you out in the distance.

1269
01:24:46,653 --> 01:24:48,772
我记得就在那时  我被深深吸引住
I remember being drawn to you even then.

1270
01:24:48,853 --> 01:24:52,982
我想 哈 奇怪 我在画别人的背
I thought, "Wow, how odd. I'm drawn to someone's back. "

1271
01:24:54,753 --> 01:24:57,922
那件让我牢牢记住的运动衫
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well.

1272
01:24:57,993 --> 01:24:59,962
充满爱恨交织
and even hate, eventually.

1273
01:25:00,033 --> 01:25:04,022
当时我想  太酷了  橙黄色的运动衫
At the time I thought, " How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1274
01:25:04,102 --> 01:25:06,831
你好
Hi there.

1275
01:25:08,902 --> 01:25:11,841
我刚才看见你
I saw you sitting over here

1276
01:25:11,902 --> 01:25:13,841
独自坐在这儿
by yourself,

1277
01:25:13,912 --> 01:25:16,811
于是我想  感谢上帝
and I thought, "Thank God.

1278
01:25:16,882 --> 01:25:19,671
原来还有不会玩这些东西的正常人
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."

1279
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:21,870
是啊
Yeah.

1280
01:25:21,951 --> 01:25:24,970
我不知该说些什么
I don't ever know what to say.

1281
01:25:25,051 --> 01:25:27,780
我是克莱门汀
I'm Clementine.

1282
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:31,020
我能吃块你的鸡肉吗?
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?

1283
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:33,320
你就直接拿了
And then you just took it

1284
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:35,919
连我的回答都不等
without waiting for an answer.

1285
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:41,959
如此亲密
It was so intimate,

1286
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:45,159
就像我们已经是恋人
Iike we were already lovers.

1287
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,039
我叫乔尔

1288
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,268

01:25:50,339 --> 01:25:53,568
好了 不准取笑我的名字
So, no jokes about my name.

1290
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:58,108
你的意思是像  "我亲爱的 我亲爱的克莱门汀"
You mean like Oh my darling, oh my darling, my darling Clementine

1291
01:25:58,179 --> 01:26:00,678
腰浆果狗?  就像那种笑话?
Huckleberry Hound, that sort of thing?

1292
01:26:00,749 --> 01:26:02,778
对  就像那样

1293
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:04,788
不会  我不会开你玩笑的
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1294
01:26:04,858 --> 01:26:08,587
当我还是小孩时  我最爱看的卡通就是腰浆果狗
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1295
01:26:12,598 --> 01:26:14,927
我想你的名字就像魔法
I think your name is magical.

1296

时候到了  乔尔

我的确和一个人生活在一起

没有狗
There's no dog.

你喝酒吗?

-我不知道  -你来选酒
I don't know. Well, you choose the wine.

01:29:10,526 --> 01:29:13,395
我想你也许是个疯子
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1339
01:29:13,466 --> 01:29:16,265
但你只是兴奋
but you were exciting.

1340
01:29:17,366 --> 01:29:19,305
我希望你留下
I wish you'd stayed.

1341
01:29:19,376 --> 01:29:22,065
我也希望我留下  现在我希望我留下
I wish I'd stayed too. Now I wish I'd stayed.

1342
01:29:22,135 --> 01:29:25,194
我希望自己做过很多事
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1343
01:29:25,275 --> 01:29:27,604
上帝  我希望
Oh, God, I wish I had--

1344
01:29:31,585 --> 01:29:34,714
我真的希望我能留下
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1345
01:29:34,785 --> 01:29:37,064
-当我下楼来时  你已经走了
Well, I came back down stairs and you were gone.

1346
01:29:37,064 --> 01:29:39,343
-我出去了  我从门口出去了
-I walked out. I walked out the door.

1347
01:29:39,424 --> 01:29:42,253
-为什么?  -我不知道  我像个吓坏的小孩一样
Why? I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid.

1348
01:29:42,324 --> 01:29:45,653
我就像  我想不出来  我不知道
I was like-- It was above my head. I don't know.

1349
01:29:45,734 --> 01:29:47,663
你吓坏了?
You were scared?

1350
01:29:47,734 --> 01:29:49,663
是的
Yeah.

1351
01:29:50,704 --> 01:29:53,323
我想你了解我那一点
Thought you knew that about me.

1352
01:29:53,403 --> 01:29:57,392
我想我跑到篝火那里  逃避我的羞辱
I ran back to the bonfiire trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1353
01:29:57,473 --> 01:30:01,102
-是我说错了什么吗?  -是的
Was it something I said? Yeah.

1354
01:30:03,883 --> 01:30:06,282
你说 "那走吧"
You said, "So go"

1355
01:30:06,353 --> 01:30:08,812
用那样轻蔑的口气  你知道吗?
with such disdain, you know?

1356
01:30:08,882 --> 01:30:11,511
-对不起  -没什么
Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay.

1357
01:30:17,092 --> 01:30:19,021
乔伊?
Joely?

1358
01:30:19,092 --> 01:30:21,961
如果你这次留下来会怎么样?
What if you stayed this time?

1359
01:30:24,631 --> 01:30:27,260
我已走出了门
I walked out the door.

1360
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:29,270
没有记忆留下了
There's no memory left.

1361
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,460
那至少回来告别
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.

1362
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:34,470
假装至少我们告别过
Let's pretend we had one.

1363
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:48,079
别了 乔尔
Bye, Joel.

1364
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:50,089
我爱你
I love you.

1365
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,419
到蒙塔克来找我
Meet me in Montauk.

1366
01:30:58,099 --> 01:31:02,298
飞机坠毁了  不是我让它坠毁的
I didn't crash the plane. The plane crashed. I didn't crash the plane.

1367
01:31:02,369 --> 01:31:06,458
是你用遥控器把飞机坠毁的
You were operating the plane with the remote control and then it crashed.

1368
01:31:06,539 --> 01:31:08,868
风太大了
It was fucking windy. Come on, man.

1369
01:31:08,938 --> 01:31:10,907
你晕晕的还硬要开车
You're stoned, and you're driving.

1370
01:31:10,978 --> 01:31:13,537
是的  白粉使我平衡  白粉使我兴奋
Yeah, the pot balances it out. The pot brings you back up.

1371
01:31:13,608 --> 01:31:16,137
所以我想喝酒时就会去吸它
That's why I smoke it. If I'm going to be drinking then I'll smoke it.

1372
01:31:16,218 --> 01:31:19,837
的确有效  在科学网络上
It does. That's a medical fiact.

1373
01:31:19,918 --> 01:31:22,347
这是被医学证实了的
It was proven on the Science Network.

1374
01:31:22,418 --> 01:31:24,857
-宝贝  看好路  -我什么也看不见
Honey, just watch the road. I can't see shit.

1375
01:31:27,427 --> 01:31:30,416
我看见你和一个漂亮的女性谈话
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.

1376
01:31:30,497 --> 01:31:33,326
-她人很好  -是的  那是谁?
She was nice. Yeah, man. Who was that?

1377
01:31:35,427 --> 01:31:38,726
她只是一个女孩
She was, um, just a girl.

1378
01:31:46,246 --> 01:31:49,105
完了
Okay.

1379
01:32:24,614 --> 01:32:27,373
那我把卡车开回去
So I gotta-- I gotta drop the van off.

1380
01:32:27,443 --> 01:32:29,542
谢谢  斯坦  谢谢
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1381
01:32:29,613 --> 01:32:32,952
我们以后再谈
We'll talk.

1382
01:33:57,427 --> 01:34:00,156
-你拿走了很多你的东西  -是的  我的东西
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see. Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1383
01:34:00,237 --> 01:34:03,666
我知道你不会再回来  要是我也会这么做
I take it you're not coming back. I wouldn't come back if l was you either.

1384
01:34:03,737 --> 01:34:07,466
-你敢发誓你不知道么?  -我发誓
Do you swear you didn't know? I swear.

1385
01:34:07,537 --> 01:34:11,136
-是你给我做的记忆清除吗?  -不是  上帝作证
So you didn't do the erasing? Of course not. God, no.

1386
01:34:11,207 --> 01:34:13,406
难道你没怀疑过我和他曾是一对?
And you never even suspected we were together?

1387
01:34:13,476 --> 01:34:17,705
也许有一次
Once, maybe.

1388
01:34:17,786 --> 01:34:20,775
我工作回来  你在车里
I was coming back from a job and you were at his car.

1389
01:34:20,856 --> 01:34:23,445
我看见你俩在交谈
I saw you two talking.

1390
01:34:23,526 --> 01:34:27,255
我向你招手  你冲我笑
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.

1391
01:34:27,326 --> 01:34:29,625
我看上去怎样?
How'd I look?

1392
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:32,994
看上去很高兴
You looked happy.

1393
01:34:33,065 --> 01:34:35,324
高兴有着自己的秘密
Happy with a secret.

1394
01:34:36,735 --> 01:34:38,664
以后呢?
And after that?

1395
01:34:38,735 --> 01:34:41,894
我再也没有看见你俩像那样了  所以我想
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just--

1396
01:34:41,975 --> 01:34:45,664
那也许只是自己的想象
I don't know. I just figured I was imagining things.

1397
01:35:10,463 --> 01:35:12,952
我真的喜欢你 玛丽・斯皮尔
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1398
01:35:14,132 --> 01:35:16,431
你知道吗?
You know that?

1399
01:35:26,482 --> 01:35:28,451
谢谢
Thanks.

1400
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:04,168
让我先去刷牙
Let me get my toothbrush.

1401
01:36:19,328 --> 01:36:21,887
你在哪儿  克莱? 我很担心.
Where are you, Clem? I'm worried.

1402
01:36:21,968 --> 01:36:26,337
我感觉你对我火气很大  我不知道自己做了什么
I feel like you're mad at me and I don't know what I did.

1403
01:36:26,408 --> 01:36:29,167
我做了什么?
What did I do?

1404
01:36:29,238 --> 01:36:31,707
我是如此的爱你
I love you so much.

1405
01:36:31,777 --> 01:36:33,766
我愿意做任何让你高兴的事
I'll do anything to make you happy.

1406
01:36:33,847 --> 01:36:36,106
告诉我你想我干什么  我就去干什么
Tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.

1407
01:36:36,177 --> 01:36:39,946
听着  今早我会来看你是否还好
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.

1408
01:36:52,756 --> 01:36:55,955
开车吧  司机
Vamonos, senor.

1409
01:36:56,026 --> 01:36:59,195
昨晚我过得真棒!
I had a really nice time last night.

1410
01:36:59,266 --> 01:37:01,895
真棒?
Nice?

1411
01:37:01,965 --> 01:37:05,204
我一生中过得最棒的一夜是
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life

1412
01:37:05,275 --> 01:37:07,204
昨晚
Last night.

1413
01:37:07,275 --> 01:37:09,264
很好
That's better.

1414
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:16,574
-这真怪  -致所有霍华德医生的病人们
This is weird. To all patients of Dr.Howard Mierzwiak.

1415
01:37:16,654 --> 01:37:20,143
我叫玛丽・斯皮尔 你们见过我 但你们已不记得我了
My name is Mary Svevo. We've met, but you don't remember me.

1416
01:37:20,224 --> 01:37:24,653
我为一间你们雇来消除  你们部分回忆的公司工作
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."

1417
01:37:24,724 --> 01:37:27,253
当我发现这很可怕后
I have since decided that this is a horrible.

1418
01:37:27,324 --> 01:37:31,883
为了补偿  我把档案寄还给每一个人
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's fiile back to them.

1419
01:37:31,963 --> 01:37:35,562
我是克莱门汀・克罗斯基
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.

1420
01:37:35,633 --> 01:37:38,362
我来清除对乔尔・巴瑞斯的回忆
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1421
01:37:38,433 --> 01:37:40,662
-这是什么?  -我不知道
What is this? I don't know.

1422
01:37:40,743 --> 01:37:45,332
他很无聊 这理由足够清除对他的回忆吗?
He's boring. Is that enough reason to erase someone?

1423
01:37:45,413 --> 01:37:49,102
我最近在想  以前的我和现在的我差异太大
I've been thinking lately, how I was before and how I am now,

1424
01:37:49,182 --> 01:37:51,111
他改变了我
and it's like he changed me.

1425
01:37:51,182 --> 01:37:53,061
现在我总是很生气
I feel like I'm alway's pissy, now.

1426
01:37:53,062 --> 01:37:54,951
和他在一起时  我不再像是我自己
I don't like myself when I'm with him. I don't like myself anymore.

1427
01:37:55,022 --> 01:37:59,611
我甚至不能忍受看见他  那悲惨  懦弱的笑容
I can't stand to even look at him. That pathetic wimpy apologetic smile.

1428
01:37:59,692 --> 01:38:01,291
-那真是个令人讨厌的家伙 知道吗?
-That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?

1429
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:02,891
-你在干什么?
-What are you doing?

1430
01:38:02,891 --> 01:38:04,170
-我什么也没干
I 'm not doing anything.

1431
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:05,460
-我和他之间的爱情玫瑰已凋谢了
-The bloom is certainly fucking off i the rose at this point.

1432
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:08,450
-你在耍我吗?  -没有!
-Are you screwing with me? -No!

1433
01:38:08,531 --> 01:38:10,960
-你在耍我!  -乔尔  我没有
-You are screwing with me. -Joel, I'm not!

1434
01:38:11,031 --> 01:38:15,400
-你显然是  -瞧  让我们
-You clearly are. -Look, let's just take a minute and--

1435
01:38:44,069 --> 01:38:45,998
帕特里克  滚开!
Patrick, get the fuck away.

1436
01:38:46,069 --> 01:38:48,468
-甜心  -他妈的滚!
Oh, sweetheart-- Get the fuck away from me!

1437
01:38:48,538 --> 01:38:51,767
-我们能谈谈吗?  -不  滚!
Can we talk about it? No! Get the fuck away!

1438
01:39:24,036 --> 01:39:26,295
乔尔・巴瑞斯
Joel Barish.

1439
01:39:26,376 --> 01:39:29,135
你好  克莱门汀
Hey, Clementine. Hey.

1440
01:39:29,206 --> 01:39:32,435
见到你真好
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1441
01:39:35,445 --> 01:39:37,434
真的没受过多少教育
Really, very. educated.

1442
01:39:37,515 --> 01:39:40,954
我的意思是  她很聪明  但没受过多少教育
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.

1443
01:39:41,015 --> 01:39:43,914
我没办法和她谈论书籍  你知道吗?
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?

1444
01:39:43,985 --> 01:39:47,424
她只是个喜欢看杂志的女孩
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.

1445
01:39:47,495 --> 01:39:50,894
她的用词发音很差
Her vocabulary. Leaves something to be desired.

1446
01:39:50,964 --> 01:39:53,623
有时令我在公共场所感到难堪
Sometimes-- I was embarrassed in public

1447
01:39:53,694 --> 01:39:55,683
-你好  -因为她会把
Hi. because she would pronounce

1448
01:39:55,764 --> 01:39:58,533
-图书馆都读错
Library. "libary.. " Hi.

1449
01:40:01,804 --> 01:40:03,733
看我找到了什么
Look what I found.

1450
01:40:03,803 --> 01:40:08,142
我想克莱门汀真正吸引人的地方
I think ifithere's a truly seductive quality about Clementine,

1451
01:40:08,213 --> 01:40:11,872
就是她的个性能让你忘却世俗烦恼
it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.

1452
01:40:13,253 --> 01:40:15,582
你把我画得皮包骨
You made me look skinny.

1453
01:40:15,653 --> 01:40:18,212
她就像燃烧的流星
Amazing, burning meteorite

1454
01:40:18,283 --> 01:40:22,582
载着你去极乐之地
will carry you to another world where things are exciting.

1455
01:40:22,652 --> 01:40:25,681
但你很快就会发现
But what you quickly learn is that

1456
01:40:25,762 --> 01:40:28,591
那只不过是精心设计的圈套
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1457
01:40:28,662 --> 01:40:30,651
对不起冲你大喊大叫
I'm sorry yelled at you.

1458
01:40:32,262 --> 01:40:34,991
-没什么  -一种显而易见、华而不实的圈套
It's okay. So flashy, in a kind of obvious way.

1459
01:40:36,701 --> 01:40:39,260
-但那仍然诱惑着你  -乔尔  我真的喜欢你
But still, it seduces you. Joel, I really like you.

1460
01:40:39,341 --> 01:40:41,570
我恨自己说了你的坏话
I hate that I said mean things about you.

1461
01:40:41,641 --> 01:40:46,100
-我关掉录音机  好吗?  -等等  这很公平
-Let me turn this off, okay? - Hey, it's-- it's only fiair.

1462
01:40:47,451 --> 01:40:49,410
真实的克莱门汀在哪里?
Where's the real Clementine?

1463
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:52,610
她发型能有什么狗屁意义?  简直是扯蛋!
I mean the whole thing with the hair-- it's all bullshit.

1464
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,409
-我真的喜欢你的发型  -谢谢你
- I really like your hair. -Thank you.

1465
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,719
-真的喜欢  -谢谢你
I really like your hair. Thank you.

1466
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:59,719
-我真的  -整个世界都混乱了
I do. The world's a goddamn mess.

1467
01:40:59,790 --> 01:41:01,609
-她想靠改变头发颜色突出反叛个性吗?
Is it some kind of a revolt? Change your hair color.

1468
01:41:01,610 --> 01:41:03,419
-你想喝点什么?
-You want a drink or something?

1469
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,229
有威士忌吗?
Do you have any whiskey?

1470
01:41:06,299 --> 01:41:11,598
不  我不认为她的性生活是有目的的
No, I don't think her sex is motivated.

1471
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:14,658
昨晚我们在一起时  我看得很清楚
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.

1472
01:41:14,739 --> 01:41:18,138
那不是性生活  那是悲哀!
It wasn't sex. It was just sad.

1473
01:41:18,209 --> 01:41:21,268
对不起  我以为威士忌还有很多
Hey. Sorry. I thought there was more.

1474
01:41:21,348 --> 01:41:25,007
克莱认为让人们喜欢她的唯一方法就是
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her

1475
01:41:25,078 --> 01:41:27,917
和他们上床
is to fuck

1476
01:41:27,988 --> 01:41:32,217
或至少给出这个可能
or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of them.

1477
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:35,227
她是如此的绝望和没有安全感
And she's so desperate and insecure

1478
01:41:35,288 --> 01:41:40,127
迟早她会和所有人上床
that she'll sooner or later go around fucking everybody.

1479
01:41:40,197 --> 01:41:43,216
-我不是那样  -我不会那样想你
I don't do that. I wouldn't think that about you.

1480
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:46,196
-因为我不是  -我知道
-Because I don't. -I know.

1481
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:49,496
但你那样说真的很伤我心  因为我不是那样的人
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.

1482
01:41:49,567 --> 01:41:52,666
-很对不起  -对不起  我得走了
I'm so sorry. I 'm sorry about all this. I 'm gonna go.

1483
01:41:52,736 --> 01:41:57,545
我感到迷惑  我想我真的不能在这里待下去
I'm a little confused. I don't really think I can be here.

1484
01:42:05,416 --> 01:42:08,045
-别了  -我以为自己很了解她
Bye. I thought I knew her so well.

1485
01:42:08,125 --> 01:42:11,714
-能认识你真好  -但我根本就不了解她
It was nice meeting you and all. But I don't know her at all.

1486
01:42:13,025 --> 01:42:16,394
经过了这么长的时间
What a loss to spend that much time with someone,

1487
01:42:16,465 --> 01:42:20,364
才发现她是最熟悉的陌生人
only to fiind out that she's a stranger.

1488
01:42:23,674 --> 01:42:25,663
等等!
Wait.

1489
01:42:27,344 --> 01:42:29,273
-什么?  -我不知道
What? I don't know.

1490
01:42:29,344 --> 01:42:31,503
-你想要怎样  乔尔? 就等一会儿!
Just wait. Just wait. What do you want, Joel?

1491
01:42:31,574 --> 01:42:36,103
我不知道  我只想你再等等
I don't know. I want you to wait for just a while.

1492
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:52,352
-好的  -真的?
Okay. Really?

1493
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:54,491
我不是一个完美的概念  乔尔
I'm not a concept, Joel.

1494
01:42:54,492 --> 01:42:56,561
我只是一个寻找内心宁静的混乱女孩
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of i mind.

1495
01:42:56,632 --> 01:43:00,571
-我并不完美  -我找不到不去爱你的理由
-I'm not perfect. -I can't see anything that I don't like about you.

1496
01:43:00,642 --> 01:43:03,331
-我找不到  -但你会的
Right now I can't. But you will. But you will.

1497
01:43:03,412 --> 01:43:05,221
你知道  你会找到的
You know, you will think of things,

1498
01:43:05,222 --> 01:43:07,031
而我会对你感到厌倦  觉得拘束
and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped

1499
01:43:07,111 --> 01:43:09,170
因为这以前就发生过
because that's what happens with me.

1500
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:12,580
好吧
Okay.

1501
01:43:16,281 --> 01:43:18,280
好吧?
Okay.

1502
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:25,549
-好的  -好的
Okay. Okay.
