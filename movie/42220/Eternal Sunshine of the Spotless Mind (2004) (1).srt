[Chuckles]

316

<i>Hey, Clem-ato.</i>

317
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:07,742
Patrick! Baby boy.

318
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,023
<i>What you doing here, baby?
[Patrick]
Just came to surprise you.</i>

319
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,992
Let me know
if you need something, sir.
You look good.

320
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,994
<i>- [Patrick] Hi.
- [Kiss]</i>

321
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:21,156
<i>How are you?
[Clementine] Pretty good.
Pretty bored. Pretty tired.</i>

322
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:23,166
<i>[Patrick]
Uh-huh.</i>

323
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,362
<i>[Clementine]
I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.</i>

324
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,700
[Panting]

325
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:38,912
Why?

326
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:41,474
Why would she do that to me?

327
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,881
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

328
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,553
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

329
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:52,562
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

330
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,564
I know, honey.
For being honest.

331
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:56,896
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.

332
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,903
<i>No! No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.</i>

333
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,337
Get off. It's too...

334
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,341
<i>Right.
Yeah.</i>

335
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,343
I don't want to seem desperate.

336
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:11,007
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,
make a clean break. Right?

337
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,210
<i>Right?
[Joel Groans]</i>

338
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,354
<i>All right, Joel,
look, man, seriously.</i>

339
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,357
<i>[Woman]
Rob!
Here's the deal.</i>

340
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,588
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

341
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:26,824
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

342
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,423
You're gonna make this
about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

343
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,561
<i>I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?</i>

344
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,629
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

345
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:39,876
<i>- What are you...
- That's your laundry!</i>

Okay.

348
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:08,067
<i>What is it?
[Rob] I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.</i>

349

<i>[Woman]

Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

352
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,261

353

Could you spell that, please?</i>

Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

361
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,082
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.
Really?

362
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,254
- Thank you.
- [Mutters] Great.

363
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:07,263
I don't have a pen.

Oh.</i>

366
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:16,371
<i>Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.</i>

367
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,431
Mr. Barish?

368
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:22,745
How are we today?

369
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:24,747
Not too good, actually.

370
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:26,749
<i>Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!</i>

371
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:29,752
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!

372

Sorry. Sorry.

[Whispers]
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

374
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,128
You should not
have seen this.

375
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,187
I apologize.

376
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:46,502
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

377
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,404
<i>I assure you, no.
[Woman]
No.</i>

378
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:57,576
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

379
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,280
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

380
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:04,821
so I can't show you evidence.

381
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:10,623
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

382
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,754
and she wanted to move on.

383
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,764
<i>[Dr. Mierzwiak]

It's okay.
It's all right.

391
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,780
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

392
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:41,555
<i>What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.</i>

393
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,423
She's impulsive.

394
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:47,055
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

395
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,900
[Sighs]

396
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,902
A lark.

397

[Sobbing]
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

398

<i>[Woman]
Wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

399
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:04,747
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

400
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,807
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

401
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:11,252
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

402
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:14,257
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

403
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,886
<i>And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.</i>

404
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,627
Now, the, uh...

405
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,637
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

406
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,639
<i>is to go home...</i>

407
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:35,145
<i>and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.</i>

408
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:37,442
<i>Anything.</i>

409
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:43,148
<i>And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.</i>

410
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,814
<i>Okay?</i>

411
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,953
<i>So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,</i>

412
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:55,988
<i>books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,</i>

<i>journal entries.</i>

<i>We want to empty your home...</i>

00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:04,938
<i>We want to empty your life
of Clementine.</i>

416
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,503
<i>And after the mapping is done,
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.</i>

417
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,913
<i>That way, when you awake
in the morning,</i>

418
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:17,420
<i>you'll find yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...</i>

Great to meet you,

My name is Joel Barish,

and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

442
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,962
Uh, I was...

443
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:45,839
living with this woman, Naomi,

444
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,470

<i>Naomi couldn't go, but I went...</i>

<i>and I, uh, met Clementine.</i>

448

<i>[Pencils Clattering On Floor]
I'm sorry.</i>

449
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,396
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

450
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:10,059
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

451
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,068
There's an emotional core...

452
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,070
to each of our memories,

453
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,904
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

454
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:20,409
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

455
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:24,209
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

456
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:26,306
as in a dream upon waking.

457
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:29,682
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

458
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:32,745
Well, uh, technically speaking,

459
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:34,757
<i>the procedure is brain damage,</i>

460

01:22:01,582 --> 01:22:04,608
Look, man,
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance,

1356
01:22:04,685 --> 01:22:09,247
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1357
01:22:09,323 --> 01:22:11,655
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1358
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:14,854
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1359
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:17,090
Okay.

1360
01:22:17,164 --> 01:22:20,065
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1361
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:22,932
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1362
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:26,633
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1363
01:22:26,707 --> 01:22:31,371
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech
really well.

1364
01:22:31,445 --> 01:22:34,937
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole
human race pegged.

1365
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:37,007
Hmm. Probably.

1366
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:41,484
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1367
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:43,490
even after that.

1368
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:46,959
Mmm. I know.

1369
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,288
It would be different...

1370
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:54,833
if we could just give it
another go around.

1371
01:22:58,806 --> 01:23:01,172
Remember me.

1372
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:03,233
Try your best.

1373
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,514
Maybe we can.

1374
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:41,714
[Mierzwiak]
Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,

1375
01:23:41,782 --> 01:23:44,376
and, uh, then we'll
take it from there.

1376
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,682
[Mary]
Okay.

1377
01:23:46,754 --> 01:23:49,655
I liked you immediately.

1378
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:52,215
<i>You didn't
come on to me at all.</i>

1380

<i>I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.</i>

1381
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:01,061
<i>I wanted you to think
I was smart.</i>

1382
01:24:02,269 --> 01:24:04,601
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1383
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:08,164
I had these fantasies
of us being married...

1384
01:24:08,242 --> 01:24:11,609
and having kids and... just...

<i>[Mary Crying]
Yeah, I know.</i>

1388
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:21,588
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1389
01:24:21,922 --> 01:24:24,015
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1390
01:24:24,091 --> 01:24:26,025
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

1391
01:24:26,093 --> 01:24:28,584
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...

1392
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:31,257
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.

1393
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:33,266
No, no, no, no!

1394
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,495
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.

1395
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:38,561
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1396
01:24:40,808 --> 01:24:43,538
<i>[Joel]
This is the day we met.</i>

1397
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:46,808
<i>You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out
in the distance.</i>

1398
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,008
<i>I remember being drawn to you
even then.</i>

1399
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:53,213
<i>I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."</i>

1400
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:58,152
<i>You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...</i>

1401
01:24:58,225 --> 01:25:00,193
<i>and even hate, eventually.</i>

1402
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:04,254
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1403
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:07,061
Hi there.

1404
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:09,068
Hi.

1405
01:25:09,136 --> 01:25:12,071
I saw you sitting over here...

1406
01:25:12,139 --> 01:25:14,073
by yourself,

1407
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:17,042
and I thought, "Thank God.

1408
01:25:17,111 --> 01:25:19,909
Someone normal
who doesn't know how to interact
at these things either."

1409
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,107
Yeah.

1410
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:25,209
I don't ever know what to say.

1411
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:28,016
I'm Clementine.

1412
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:31,252
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1413
01:25:31,325 --> 01:25:33,555
And then you just took it...

1414
01:25:33,627 --> 01:25:36,152
without waiting for an answer.

1415
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,191
It was so intimate,

1416
01:25:42,269 --> 01:25:45,397
like we were already lovers.

1417
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:48,271
I'm Joel.

1418
01:25:48,342 --> 01:25:50,503
Hi, Joel.

1419
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:53,809
So, no jokes about my name.

1420
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:58,341
You mean like...
# Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine #

1421
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,910
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1422
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:03,013
Yeah. Like that.

1423
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:05,024
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1424
01:26:05,092 --> 01:26:08,823
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1425
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,887
<i>Oh.</i>

1426
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:15,165
I think your name is magical.

1427
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:20,370
This is it, Joel.

1428
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:22,636
It's gonna be gone soon.

1429
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,111
I know.

1430
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:29,115
What do we do?

1431
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:34,010
Enjoy it.

1432
01:26:50,671 --> 01:26:52,969
[Clementine]
You married?
No.

1433
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,668
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1434
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,643
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1435
01:26:57,711 --> 01:27:01,078
Male or female?
What?

1436
01:27:01,148 --> 01:27:03,582
Female. Female.

1437
01:27:05,719 --> 01:27:09,211
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1438
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:15,985
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.

1439
01:27:16,997 --> 01:27:18,931
They might have a dog.

1440
01:27:18,999 --> 01:27:22,662
[Giggling]
There's no dog.

1441

It's dark.

1448
01:27:52,299 --> 01:27:56,292
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1449
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:59,601
Naomi, but we're not really...

We're...

Whatever.

<i>So this is great.
Now I can look for, um,
candles, matches...</i>

01:28:06,313 --> 01:28:08,781

<i>I think we should go.
Why?</i>

1458

It's our house...
just for tonight.
[Sighs]

We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

<i>Which one do you want to be?
Uh...</i>

What are you do...
[Chuckling]

1463
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:43,445
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.

1464
01:28:43,517 --> 01:28:46,111
So, are you okay with wine?

1465
01:28:46,186 --> 01:28:48,848
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.

1466
