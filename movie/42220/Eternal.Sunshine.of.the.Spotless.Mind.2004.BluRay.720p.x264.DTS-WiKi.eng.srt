1
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,486
Random thoughts

2
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:40,992
for Valentine's Day, 2004.

3
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:45,659
Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...

4
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:49,031
to make people feel like crap.

5
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,290
I ditched work today.

6
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,604
Took a train out to Montauk

7
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,573
I don't know why.

8
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:06,326
I'm not an impulsive person.

9
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:16,661
I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.

10
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:19,994
I need to get my car fixed.

11
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:25,039
Hi, Cindy. It's Joel. Joel!

12
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:27,763
I don't feel very well today.

13
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:30,887
no, food poisoning, I think

14
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:34,088
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

15
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:37,115
Montauk in February
- brilliant, Joel.

16
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,139
Pages ripped out.
Don't remember doing that.

17
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:49,262
It appears this is my first entry
in two years.

18
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:59,797
Sand is overrated.

19
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,033
It's just tiny little rocks.

20
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:14,767
If only I could meet someone new.

21
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:19,461
I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished...

22
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:21,680
since I'm incapable
of making eye contact

23
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,739
with a woman I don't know.

24
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,813
Maybe I should get back together
with naomi.

25
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,064
She was nice.

26
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:32,160
nice is good.

27
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:35,665
She loved me.

28
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,920
Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see...

29
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:18,147
who shows me the least bit
of interest?

30
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,227
Hi.

31
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,071
I'm sorry?

32
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:04,767
I just said hi.

33
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,578
Hi, hello.

34
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,334
Okay if I sit closer?

35
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:13,682
How far are you going?

36
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,920
Rockville Center.

37
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,128
Me, too.

38
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:19,072
Really?

39
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:20,842
What are the odds?

40
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:24,851
Do I know you?

41
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,029
Do you ever shop at Barnes and noble?

42
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:31,209
Sure.

43
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,729
That's it! I've seen you.

44
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:40,120
Book slave there for five years now.

45
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:42,734
I would have thought
I would remember you.

46
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,466
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,621
What might?

48
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,637
It changes a lot. The color.

49
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,213
That's why you might not recognize me.

50
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:51,494
It's called Blue Ruin.

51
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:52,711
The color.

52
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:54,872
Snappy name, huh?

53
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,263
I like it.

54
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:02,628
This company makes a whole line
of colors with snappy names.

55
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:06,454
Red Menace, Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution...

56
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:09,551
That would be a job,
coming up with those names.

57
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,369
You think there
could possibly be a job like that?

58
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,911
How many hair colors could there be?

59
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:16,582
Fifty?

60
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:18,602
Someone's got that job.

61
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,134
Agent Orange.

62
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:22,946
I came up with that one.

63
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:26,324
I apply my personality in a paste.

64
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,415
I doubt that very much.

65
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:31,127
Well, you don't know me, so

66
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,699
you don't know, do you?

67
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:37,843
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:41,046
I was just trying to be nice.

69
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:44,448
I got it.

70
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:05,986
My name's Clementine, by the way.

71
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:06,998
I'm Joel.

72
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:08,530
Hi, Joel.

73
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:11,514
no jokes about my name.

74
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,025
Oh no. You wouldn't do that.

75
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,699
You're trying to be nice.

76
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:18,758
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

77
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:20,325
Huckleberry Hound.

78
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:23,482
I don't know what that means.

79
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,265
Huckleberry Hound?

80
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:26,684
What are you, nuts?

81
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:28,328
It's been suggested.

82
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:32,433
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling,
oh, my darling Clementine...

83
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:37,687
You are lost and gone forever,
dreadful sorry, Clementine.

84
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:42,940
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though.
Really nice.

85
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:46,307
It means merciful, right?

86
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:47,737
Clemency?

87
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:49,303
Although it hardly fits.

88
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,986
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

89
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,180
I wouldn't think that about you.

90
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,979
Why wouldn't you?

91
00:07:56,998 --> 00:08:02,384
I don't know.

92
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,511
You seemed nice.

93
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,491
now I'm nice?

94
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,451
Don't you know any other adjectives?

95
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:10,909
I don't need to be nice.

96
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:14,695
And I don't need anybody
to be nice to me.

97
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,091
Okay.

98
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:20,264
Joel?

99
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:22,985
It's Joel, right?

100
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:25,386
Yes.

101
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:28,544
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

102
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,925
I'm a little of out sorts today.

103
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:47,614
My embarrassing admission is I really
like that you're nice right now.

104
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,253
I can't tell from one moment
to the next

105
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,339
what I'm going to like, but...

106
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:55,714
right now I'm glad you are.

107
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:07,239
I have some stuff that
I probably should...

108
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,416
Oh! I'm sorry.

109
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:12,316
Okay.
no...

110
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:16,589
Sure.
That's okay.

111
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:18,818
Take care, then.

112
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:20,521
Jesus.

113
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:38,757
Hi.
I could give you a ride if you need.

114
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,882
It's cold.

115
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,555
Yeah! Okay.

116
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:44,190
It is frosty.

117
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,990
You're not a stalker or anything,
right?

118
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,040
I'm not a stalker.

119
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:48,737
You're the one that talked to me,
remember?

120
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,000
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book

121
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,696
Really? There's a stalker book?

122
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,035
I've got to read that one.

123
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,595
I'm sorry if I came off sort of nutso.

124
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,298
I'm not really.

125
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:11,841
That's okay.
I didn't think you were.

126
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,426
Do you want to have a drink?

127
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,799
I have lots of drinks, and I could --

128
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:27,190
never mind.
That was stupid.

129
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,429
I'm embarrassed now. Goodnight.

130
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:52,236
Two Blue Ruins.

131
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:55,365
Thank you.

132
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:57,211
Drink up, young man.

133
00:10:57,706 --> 00:11:01,075
It'll make the whole
seduction part less repugnant.

134
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:07,021
I'm just kidding! Come on.

135
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,757
You're kind of closed-mouthed,
aren't you?

136
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:17,325
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:22,365
You know,
my life isn't that interesting.

138
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:25,845
I go to work, I come home...

139
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,521
I don't know what to say.

140
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,380
You should read my journal.

141
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,688
It's just... blank

142
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:36,842
Really?

143
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:38,444
Does that make you sad or anxious?

144
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:42,513
I'm always anxious, thinking I'm not
living my life to the fullest.

145
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:44,566
Taking advantage
of every possibility and...

146
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,293
making sure I'm not wasting
one second of the little time I have.

147
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,269
I think about that.

148
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:57,676
You're really nice.

149
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,146
I have to stop saying that.

150
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:04,571
I'm gonna marry you.

151
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,623
I know it.

152
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,749
Okay.

153
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:18,628
Joel. You should come up
to the Charles with me sometime.

154
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,610
It gets frozen this time of year.

155
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:21,620
That sounds scary.

156
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:23,257
Fxactly.

157
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:27,118
I'll pack a picnic - a night picnic

158
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,629
- night picnics are different.

159
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:32,541
That sounds good.

160
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:36,473
But I should go now.

161
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:38,494
You should stay.

162
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:42,527
I really have to get up
so early and...

163
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:44,370
I would like you to call me.

164
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,010
Would you do that?

165
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:47,397
I'd like it.

166
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:48,967
Yes.

167
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:55,361
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call.

168
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,802
That'd be nice.

169
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,207
What took you so long?

170
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:42,335
I just walked in.

171
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,877
You miss me?

172
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,110
Oddly enough, I do.

173
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,167
You said I do.

174
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,147
I guess that means we're married.

175
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,987
I guess so.

176
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:55,345
Tomorrow night?

177
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,152
Honeymoon on Ice?

178
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:00,183
It's really solid this time of year.

179
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,822
I don't know...

180
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:05,745
Come on...

181
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,634
It's so beautiful.

182
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:15,143
Isn't it?

183
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:20,922
Don't go too far!

184
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:24,883
Are you okay?

185
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,494
Oh, my ass!

186
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:34,734
I think I should go back

187
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:35,841
Come on!

188
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,235
But what if it breaks?

189
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:40,051
What if?.
Do you really care right now?

190
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:43,149
Come here, please.

191
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:52,861
Slidey-slidey, slidey-slidey.

192
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,628
This looks good.

193
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,474
Let me show you this one thing.

194
00:14:56,621 --> 00:14:58,080
What are you doing?

195
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,320
Come on.

196
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:09,731
Think I heard a crack

197
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:12,199
It's not going to crack

198
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:15,087
Or break It's so thick

199
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,895
Show me which constellations you know.

200
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,732
I don't know.

201
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,383
I don't know any.

202
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:28,935
Show me which ones you know.

203
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:30,362
Okay.

204
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,075
Okay.

205
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,741
Oh! There's Osidius.

206
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:39,023
Where?

207
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:41,466
Right there. See?

208
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:44,382
A sort of a swoop and a cross.

209
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,818
Osidius the Fmphatic.

210
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:49,676
You're full of shit, right?

211
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,036
no. Osidius right there.

212
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,022
Swoop and a cross.

213
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:57,322
Shut up!

214
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,946
Sorry to wake you,
but we're here.

215
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,602
Can I come over to your house...

216
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:37,122
to sleep? I'm so tired.

217
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:39,914
Okay.

218
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,088
Sure.

219
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,292
Let me get my toothbrush.

220
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:07,046
Yes?

221
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,176
Can I help you?

222
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:11,156
What do you mean?

223
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,972
Can I help you with something?

224
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:17,100
no.

225
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:19,300
What are you doing here?

226
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:22,917
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

227
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,340
Oh.

228
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:26,606
Thanks.

229
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:24,130
Is that him?

230
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:26,077
I think so.

231
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:28,275
Yeah, that's him.

232
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,622
Hey, Joel.

233
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,013
Frank

234
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:50,678
Shit.

235
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:54,780
The only Valentine's Day cards
I get are from my mother.

236
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,482
How pathetic is that?

237
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:58,752
You're lucky you have Clementine.

238
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:00,696
She is way cool.

239
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:04,042
You got any big Valentine's Day plans
with her?

240
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:08,696
no.

241
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:09,912
It's only a day away.

242
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:11,651
Better make some reservations
or something.

243
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:13,746
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's, right?

244
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:15,593
McRomance!

245
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:17,401
You want some fries with that shake?

246
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:21,576
I have to go to sleep now, Frank

247
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:23,350
It's 8:30.

248
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:53,962
Patrick, stop it.

249
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:13,619
Okay.

250
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:15,814
Okay.

251
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:22,843
Showtime at the Apollo.

252
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:36,550
Quiet.

253
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:47,571
Get it off your head.

254
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,678
Hey, Joel. What's up?

255
00:21:53,255 --> 00:21:54,607
Hi, Frank

256
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:03,203
I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom.

257
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:05,181
How pathetic is that?

258
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:08,276
You're lucky you have Clementine.

259
00:22:08,563 --> 00:22:12,726
You got any big Valentine's Day plans
with her?

260
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:14,818
no.

261
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:16,622
It's only a day away.

262
00:22:16,773 --> 00:22:18,849
Better make a reservation somewhere.

263
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:21,252
Don't want to end up at Mickey D's.

264
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,381
Oh, no.

265
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:24,069
Yes.

266
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,164
Valentine's Day is three days away.

267
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:27,801
I want it resolved.

268
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,780
I'm willing to be the one
to resolve it.

269
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:33,223
So I call her,
and she's changed her number.

270
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:36,489
So I walked over to Antic Attic
to get her something.

271
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,353
I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early Valentine...

272
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:43,763
and you won't believe it?

273
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:45,302
She's there...

274
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:50,722
with this guy,
this really young guy.

275
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,938
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

276
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,633
Fxcuse me?

277
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:59,184
an I help you find something, sir?

278
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,436
Hey, Clem-ato.

279
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:08,464
Patrick! Baby boy!

280
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:12,882
What are you doing here, baby?

281
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:14,206
Just came to surprise you.

282
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:16,370
Let me know if you need something.

283
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:20,052
How are you?

284
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,595
Pretty good, pretty bored,
pretty tired.

285
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,092
I so want what's in your suit.

286
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:26,632
Oh, good.

287
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:42,808
Why would she do that to me?

288
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,692
Does anybody want a joint?

289
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,475
Rob, give it a rest.

290
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:54,291
She's punishing me.

291
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,589
For being honest..

292
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,667
I should just go to her house.

293
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:01,319
no. You don't want to go there.

294
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:03,087
Get off me. It's too...

295
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,695
Right.

296
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:06,400
I don't want to seem desperate.

297
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,973
Joel, why don't you
just see this as a sign?

298
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,918
Make a clean break

299
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,073
Alright, seriously, here's the deal.

300
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:22,195
Don't do that.

301
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,831
Rob, what are you doing?

302
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:26,020
What's your fucking suggestion?!

303
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,694
What's your brilliant,
reasoned solution?

304
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,843
You're going to make
this about our shit now?

305
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:30,014
This isn't about us.

306
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:31,410
I agree. It's not about us.

307
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:34,024
It's about Joel, who's an adult.

308
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,491
not Mama Carrie's kid.

309
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:41,190
Why don't you go do your laundry!

310
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:44,872
That's great. That's good.

311
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:58,056
Okay.

312
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:05,642
What is it?!
I don't know.

313
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,983
It's some place that does a thing...

314
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,698
Good morning. Lacuna.

315
00:25:23,953 --> 00:25:24,640
no, I'm sorry.

316
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:27,706
That offer expired after the new Year.

317
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,589
Sure.

318
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:34,628
We can fit you in...
how about on the 5th?

319
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,785
That's a Wednesday.

320
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:39,362
Great. Could you spell that, please?

321
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:42,311
Okay.
And we'll need a daytime phone number.

322
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:46,809
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

323
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,302
May I help you?

324
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:49,971
I'm Joel Barish.

325
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:51,575
Fxcuse me?

326
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:54,147
I'm Joel Barish.

327
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:55,680
I have an appointment with doctor...

328
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,482
Mierzwiak Here.

329
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:59,089
Could you please fill this out?

330
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:00,335
I just want to talk to him.

331
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:02,181
You still need to fill the form out.

332
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:02,910
Really?

333
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,588
Thank you.

334
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,889
I don't have a pen.

335
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:09,624
There's a pen right there.

336
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,967
Good morning. Lacuna.

337
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:17,181
Oh, that offer expired
after the new Year.

338
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:19,021
Mister Barish?

339
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:23,157
How are we today?

340
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:25,215
not too good, actually.

341
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,338
Oh my God! Stan!

342
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:29,500
Sorry. I was just

343
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,584
I'm working.

344
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,716
Here, Doctor.

345
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:36,139
Thank you.

346
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:38,611
You should not have seen this.

347
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:40,451
I apologize.

348
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,369
This is a hoax, right?

349
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:47,273
I mean, this is Clem's

350
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,400
I assure you, no.

351
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:58,407
There's no such thing as this.

352
00:26:59,804 --> 00:27:05,474
Our files are confidential,
so I can't show you evidence.

353
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:11,308
Suffice it to say
that Miss Kruczynski was not happy...

354
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:13,785
and she wanted to move on.

355
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,183
We provide that possibility.

356
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,913
...was not happy,
and wanted to move on.

357
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:22,485
We provide that possibility.

358
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:24,883
What the hell is that?

359
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:27,389
I'm the nicest guy
she ever went out with.

360
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,027
Ah, fuck!

361
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,607
Rob, give it a rest!

362
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:33,403
It's okay.

363
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:36,648
I am making a birdhouse.

364
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,348
Joel, you know Clementine's
just like that.

365
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,546
So impulsive.

366
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:48,232
She decided to erase you as a lark

367
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:53,583
A lark?

368
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,341
Why did you do that?

369
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,461
Wait, wait!

370
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:05,379
I want it done. now.

371
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:08,512
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time -

372
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:10,674
That's okay, Mary.

373
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:11,823
But there are people waiting.

374
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:14,917
Mister Barish,
if you'd like to come inside.

375
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:17,384
Mary, if you'd take care of Mrs. Woo.

376
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,261
Goodbye, Mrs. Woo.
Of course.

377
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:28,341
The first thing we need you to do,
Mister Barish...

378
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:33,044
is to go home and collect everything
you own that has...

379
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:35,818
some association with Clementine.

380
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:37,565
Anything.

381
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,559
We'll use these items...

382
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:45,873
to create a map of Clementine
in your brain.

383
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:50,710
We'll need photos, clothing...

384
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,920
gifts,
books she may have bought you...

385
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,817
CD's you may have bought together,
journal entries...

386
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,122
We want to empty your home...

387
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:04,940
We want to empty your life
of Clementine.

388
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,584
After the mapping is done,

389
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:10,200
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

390
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:13,463
That way, when you awake
in the morning,

391
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:14,893
you'll find yourself in your...

392
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,840
own bed, as if nothing has happened,
a new life awaiting you.

393
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,937
Wake up, buddy!

394
00:29:32,192 --> 00:29:34,173
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

395
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,719
You can't have the procedure
done three times in one month.

396
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,673
It's just not our policy here.

397
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,801
How are you today, Mister Barish?

398
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:47,006
I know it's an emergency.

399
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:48,433
We'll do everything we can.

400
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,276
We can fit you in on March 1st.

401
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:52,996
Maybe you could talk to the Doctor.

402
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:57,962
What day would you like to come
in this week?

403
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,570
Mister Barish!

404
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:09,975
February is very busy for us because
of Valentine's Day.

405
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,213
This is Stan Fink,

406
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:21,765
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

407
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,244
He'll be handling your case tonight.

408
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:27,441
Great to meet you, Mister Barish.

409
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:29,868
My name is Joel Barish...

410
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:34,702
and I'm here
to erase Clementine Kruczynski.

411
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:39,996
Very good.
now tell me about Clementine.

412
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:46,738
I was living with this woman, naomi...

413
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:51,124
a couple years ago, and my friends,
Rob and Carrie...

414
00:30:51,274 --> 00:30:53,148
invited us to this party
at the beach.

415
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,501
I don't like parties.

416
00:30:54,648 --> 00:30:57,874
And naomi couldn't go,
but I went...

417
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,570
and I met Clementine.

418
00:31:03,172 --> 00:31:04,240
I'm sorry.

419
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,006
We'll start with
your most recent memories,

420
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:11,173
and work backwards from there.

421
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:13,911
There's an emotional core
to each of our memories...

422
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:19,175
and when you eradicate that core,
it starts its degradation process.

423
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:20,915
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

424
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:22,788
all the memories we've targeted...

425
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,950
will have withered and disappeared.

426
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,629
As in a dream upon waking.

427
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,413
Is there any risk of brain damage?

428
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:35,346
Technically speaking,
the procedure is brain damage.

429
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:39,135
But it's on a par
with a night of heavy drinking.

430
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:41,015
nothing you'll miss.

431
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:43,808
Comfortable?

432
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:49,443
What we're doing here is
actually creating a map of your brain.

433
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:50,794
Let's get started.

434
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,294
If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,

435
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:54,620
we have some work to do.

436
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:58,837
I want you to react to these objects.

437
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:03,181
There's a good story behind that

438
00:32:03,327 --> 00:32:06,874
I'll get a much better
emotional read-out...

439
00:32:07,015 --> 00:32:11,286
if you refrain from any sort
of verbal description of the items.

440
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:13,058
Just please try to focus
on the memories.

441
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,833
Sorry.

442
00:32:17,244 --> 00:32:19,189
Healthy activity up there again.

443
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:20,233
Healthy read-outs.

444
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,765
Very good.

445
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,565
Here's another object.

446
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:25,967
next item.

447
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:31,225
Po-ta-to head.

448
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,924
next item.

449
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:36,893
Just focus on the memories.

450
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,710
Patrick, do me a favor, will you?

451
00:32:42,851 --> 00:32:46,042
Can you check the voltage regulator?

452
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:48,274
Voltage looks fine.

453
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,485
Really?

454
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,482
I'm not wiping as clean as
I like here.

455
00:32:56,698 --> 00:32:59,889
Technically,
the procedure is brain damage.

456
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:03,099
But it's on a par
with a night of heavy drinking.

457
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:06,358
Check the connections, please.

458
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:09,528
There you are.

459
00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:19,340
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

460
00:33:19,487 --> 00:33:22,512
Why am I standing here and...

461
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:24,634
Oh, my God, deja vu.

462
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:29,287
This is so...
We should get started.

463
00:33:29,437 --> 00:33:30,718
If we want to get the procedure...

464
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:33,189
underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

465
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:35,764
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

466
00:33:35,908 --> 00:33:37,711
I suppose so.

467
00:33:41,023 --> 00:33:42,790
This is what it would look like.

468
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,239
Very good.

469
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:49,302
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

470
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:50,794
Then you won't be confused later

471
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:53,678
by their unexplainable presence
in your home.

472
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:57,264
Patrick?

473
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,791
Patrick?

474
00:34:02,802 --> 00:34:05,020
Why are there so many wires?

475
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,900
Because we have a lot of equipment.

476
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:07,877
Does that help?

477
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:11,496
Are you sure
you set that thing up properly?

478
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:16,916
I don't know if I like this.

479
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:21,439
Ah, yourjournal.

480
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,119
That'll be invaluable.

481
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:27,498
I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.

482
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:30,384
Her name's Clementine
and she's amazing.

483
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:33,128
Whoa, Jesus!
What? What?

484
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:37,478
Careful! Step back!

485
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,819
It's fine.

486
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,869
Let's not roach the guy.

487
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:47,126
Alright. We got that one.

488
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:49,318
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

489
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,439
It's an apartment, Patrick

490
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,202
Patrick

491
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:55,988
Well, not a dump, but sort of plain.

492
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:57,667
Uninspired.

493
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:00,724
And there's sort of a stale smell.

494
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:04,832
Patrick Can we just get through this?

495
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:07,857
We've got a long night ahead of us.

496
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:15,925
This is the last time I saw you.

497
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:32,936
It's three o'clock

498
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:38,058
I kind of wrecked your car.

499
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,764
Driving drunk

500
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:41,460
It's pathetic.

501
00:35:41,994 --> 00:35:44,591
I was a little tipsy.

502
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,058
Don't call me pathetic!

503
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:47,757
It is pathetic.

504
00:35:47,908 --> 00:35:49,367
It's irresponsible.

505
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,062
You could have killed somebody.

506
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:52,423
Maybe you did kill somebody.

507
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,587
Should we turn on the news and see?

508
00:35:54,728 --> 00:35:57,752
Should I check the grill to see
if there's children or small animals?

509
00:35:57,893 --> 00:35:59,661
It's just a fucking dent.

510
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:01,122
You're like an old lady or something.

511
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:03,107
What are you like?

512
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,063
A wino?

513
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:07,145
Jesus.

514
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:09,540
Are you from the 50's or something?

515
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:11,347
A wino?

516
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:13,369
Face it.

517
00:36:13,515 --> 00:36:17,999
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you...

518
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:22,662
and in your little, wormy brain,
you're trying to figure out...

519
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,236
Did she fuck someone tonight?

520
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:30,657
See, Clem, I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

521
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,585
Isn't that how
you get people to like you?

522
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:46,976
I'm sorry, okay?

523
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,935
I didn't mean it.

524
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:56,514
Your keys.

525
00:36:56,656 --> 00:36:58,115
I won't need them anymore.

526
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:03,607
I was just angry or annoyed
or something.

527
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:11,849
Clem.

528
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,820
Got it.

529
00:37:17,462 --> 00:37:19,929
Mary's coming over tonight.

530
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,183
Just thought you'd want to know.

531
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,694
I like when Mary comes to visit.

532
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,153
I just don't think she likes me.

533
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:27,959
She likes you okay.

534
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,408
So maybe I should invite
my girlfriend over.

535
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:32,453
I have a girlfriend now.

536
00:37:32,596 --> 00:37:34,364
Do whatever you want.

537
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:43,336
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

538
00:37:43,486 --> 00:37:45,503
We have to focus here.

539
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:51,796
The thing is,
my situation is a little weird.

540
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:53,637
My girlfriend situation.

541
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:55,409
I'm sure it is.

542
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:25,277
Clem, let me drive you home.

543
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,025
Get out of my face, faggot!

544
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:30,570
Look at it out here!

545
00:38:30,715 --> 00:38:32,304
It's all falling apart!

546
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:34,950
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

547
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,251
You did it to me first!

548
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:39,611
I can't believe you did this to me!

549
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:41,221
Goddamnit!

550
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:43,483
Clem. Did you hear me?

551
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,643
By morning you'll be gone!

552
00:38:46,964 --> 00:38:50,547
The perfect ending
to this piece of shit story!

553
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:59,241
Is there something wrong with
a girl being attracted to me?

554
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:01,958
no. I think it's funny.

555
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:05,087
Who do you think's better- looking,
me or this guy?

556
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:07,281
Patrick, let's focus.

557
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,852
Remember that girl we did last week?

558
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:13,221
The one with the potatoes?

559
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:16,320
That girl?

560
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:19,836
That's this guy's girlfriend.

561
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:23,622
Was. We took care of that.

562
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,670
I kind of fell in love
with her that night.

563
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:29,503
What?

564
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:31,492
You little fucker.

565
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:32,538
What?

566
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,041
She was unconscious.

567
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:41,826
She was beautiful, and I stole
a pair of her panties, too.

568
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:45,720
Jesus!

569
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,048
They were clean.

570
00:39:48,197 --> 00:39:50,522
I don't want to hear this shit.

571
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,506
They were clean.

572
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,595
Stop. We've got work to do.

573
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:57,514
Okay. Fine.

574
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:16,367
There's more.

575
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:22,669
After we did her,
I kind of asked her out.

576
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:29,591
Jesus.

577
00:40:35,062 --> 00:40:36,651
Do you know how unethical...?

578
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,956
It's not really that bad.

579
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,660
Get that look off your face.

580
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:43,365
What's wrong?

581
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:46,018
You stole a girl's panties.

582
00:40:56,841 --> 00:41:02,641
There's someone here...
he stole your underwear.

583
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:05,258
I don't see anyone.

584
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,031
Joel, where are my boots?

585
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:46,487
I'm crawling out of my skin!

586
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:50,802
I should have left you
at the flea market.

587
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:05,792
Want to go?

588
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,029
I want to have a baby.

589
00:42:10,391 --> 00:42:12,159
Let's talk about it later.

590
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:15,291
no. I want to have a baby.

591
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:18,176
I don't think we're ready.

592
00:42:19,507 --> 00:42:21,274
You're not ready.

593
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:25,061
Do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

594
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:27,609
What?

595
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:30,670
I don't want to talk about it here.

596
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:31,786
I can't hear you.

597
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,552
I can never understand
what you're saying!

598
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,954
I said
I don't want to talk about this!

599
00:42:36,102 --> 00:42:37,597
We're fucking gonna talk about it!

600
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:41,592
You can't just say you don't
want to talk about it!

601
00:42:41,738 --> 00:42:42,284
I'm sorry.

602
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,893
I'd make a fucking good mother!

603
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:45,422
I love children.

604
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:49,076
I'm creative and I'm smart!

605
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:50,464
It's you, Joel.

606
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,519
It's you who can't commit to anything.

607
00:42:52,663 --> 00:42:55,094
It's going! It's going.
You're lucky I'm interested in you.

608
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:56,246
I don't even know why I am.

609
00:42:56,385 --> 00:42:58,461
Maybe I should end it right here!
It's over.

610
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:02,610
Leave you at the flea market,
with the costume jewelry!

611
00:43:02,752 --> 00:43:06,986
Maybe you can find a nice
antique rocking chair to die in!

612
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:16,352
All the pain. Confusion...
Hi, Patrick

613
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:17,396
How's it going, Mary?

614
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:19,342
It's freezing outside.

615
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:20,388
Find us okay?

616
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,120
Yeah.

617
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:27,939
Hot.

618
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:30,931
Poor guy.

619
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:35,732
Do you have anything real to drink?

620
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,995
We haven't checked yet.

621
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:40,734
Patrick?

622
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:42,995
Let me do the honors.

623
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,238
Mary hates me.

624
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:48,806
never really had much luck
with the ladies.

625
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:51,553
Maybe if you stopped stealing
their panties.

626
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:03,626
You didn't want any, did you, Patrick?

627
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:05,794
no. That's okay.

628
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,942
Wait.

629
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:08,434
Blessed are the forgetful,

630
00:44:08,578 --> 00:44:11,460
for they get the better even
of their blunders.

631
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,812
That's nietzsche.

632
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:25,519
Beyond Good and Fvil.

633
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:27,606
I found it in my Bartlett's.

634
00:44:27,853 --> 00:44:29,513
What's your Bartlett's?

635
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,774
It's a quote book

636
00:44:31,923 --> 00:44:34,035
It's a book of quotations.

637
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:36,403
I think Howard
will be in Bartlett's one day.

638
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:37,096
Definitely.

639
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,228
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

640
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:44,030
Can you wake him up?

641
00:44:44,274 --> 00:44:46,326
You can't wake him up.

642
00:44:54,503 --> 00:44:56,829
You don't tell me things.

643
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:00,483
I'm an open book

644
00:45:01,775 --> 00:45:03,614
I tell you everything.

645
00:45:03,758 --> 00:45:07,020
Fvery damn embarrassing thing.

646
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,610
You don't trust me.

647
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,610
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

648
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,651
I don't do that.

649
00:45:22,232 --> 00:45:24,249
I want to know you.

650
00:45:27,068 --> 00:45:29,286
I don't constantly talk

651
00:45:29,434 --> 00:45:31,343
Jesus.

652
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,762
People have to share things.

653
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:38,991
That's what intimacy is.

654
00:45:39,315 --> 00:45:41,604
I'm really pissed that
you said that to me!

655
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:43,174
Sorry.

656
00:45:43,386 --> 00:45:47,834
My life just really
isn't that interesting.

657
00:45:48,117 --> 00:45:50,964
I want to read those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.

658
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:56,151
What do you write if you don't have
any thoughts or passions or love?

659
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:07,695
november 19th, Two thousand three.

660
00:46:07,844 --> 00:46:11,178
Dinner at Kang's again.

661
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:15,946
Are we like those poor couples

662
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,593
you feel...sorry for in restaurants?

663
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:21,056
Are we the dining dead?

664
00:46:21,553 --> 00:46:25,551
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

665
00:46:30,076 --> 00:46:31,428
I like that.

666
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:35,984
How's the chicken?

667
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:38,494
Good.

668
00:46:39,852 --> 00:46:40,540
More?

669
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:42,835
no, thank you.

670
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,982
She's going to be drunk
and stupid now.

671
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,885
Would you do me a favor
and clean the goddamn hair...

672
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,690
off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

673
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,279
Yeah, it's gross.

674
00:46:59,893 --> 00:47:01,138
I think it's just...

675
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:02,185
Repulsive.

676
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:04,202
It's repulsive.

677
00:47:10,052 --> 00:47:11,891
Can we get through this?

678
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:13,595
Patrick?

679
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:15,302
Hey, Tangerine.

680
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:18,538
Patrick, it's you.

681
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,124
I'm so miserable right now.

682
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:23,614
What's wrong?

683
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,484
I don't know.

684
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,299
I'm just confused about everything.

685
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:32,525
What are you confused about?

686
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,027
Fverything's fine.

687
00:47:40,912 --> 00:47:42,016
Do you love me?

688
00:47:42,165 --> 00:47:43,445
Of course I do.

689
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:45,500
Where's the self-help section?

690
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,894
Do you think I'm ugly?

691
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,097
no. You're beautiful.

692
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:51,245
Maybe I should come over.

693
00:47:51,384 --> 00:47:56,592
Oh no. I'm a mess.

694
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,237
Just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

695
00:47:59,387 --> 00:48:00,775
Okay.

696
00:48:01,126 --> 00:48:02,442
Can I leave for a while?

697
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:03,655
My girlfriend's really upset.

698
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:08,112
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's -

699
00:48:08,503 --> 00:48:10,412
Let him go. I'll help.

700
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:12,911
How hard can it be?

701
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:13,890
She hates me.

702
00:48:14,034 --> 00:48:15,006
She wants me to go.

703
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:16,536
Go.

704
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,780
Alright.

705
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:19,484
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

706
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,163
You like?

707
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:27,149
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

708
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:27,741
I like it.

709
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:30,799
You look like a tangerine.

710
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:33,749
Clemen-teen the tangerine.

711
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,082
Juicy and seedless.

712
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:37,512
I like that.

713
00:48:39,154 --> 00:48:41,206
I like tangerines.

714
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:43,183
Can you see me doing ducks?

715
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:45,547
Tangerine...

716
00:48:46,286 --> 00:48:47,780
How does he know to call you that?

717
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:49,166
How did who know?

718
00:48:49,313 --> 00:48:51,816
Oh my God. Clem?

719
00:48:51,957 --> 00:48:53,381
That's what they called themselves.

720
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:56,096
The Clash,
the only band that mattered.

721
00:48:56,237 --> 00:48:58,348
And they called themselves
that for a reason.

722
00:48:58,498 --> 00:48:59,399
It's amazing, isn't it?

723
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:00,514
Like Social Justice.

724
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:02,208
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

725
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,933
What Howard gives to the world.

726
00:49:06,117 --> 00:49:08,027
Yeah.

727
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:10,496
To let people begin again.

728
00:49:12,414 --> 00:49:13,518
It's beautiful.

729
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:18,222
You look at a baby, and it's
so pure and so free and so...

730
00:49:18,434 --> 00:49:19,964
clean and...

731
00:49:20,103 --> 00:49:24,137
Adults are this mess
of sadness and...

732
00:49:24,592 --> 00:49:26,324
phobias.

733
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:29,040
And Howard just makes it all go away.

734
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:43,540
Baby, what's going on?

735
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:45,424
I don't know.

736
00:49:45,572 --> 00:49:49,391
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.

737
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:51,198
My skin's coming off!.

738
00:49:51,347 --> 00:49:52,177
I'm getting old!

739
00:49:52,321 --> 00:49:53,673
nothing makes any sense to me!

740
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:54,885
You're not getting old.

741
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,588
nothing makes any sense.

742
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,363
nothing makes any sense.

743
00:49:58,514 --> 00:50:00,246
Tangerine...

744
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,184
It's okay.

745
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:07,622
Let's go out dancing.

746
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:09,607
You want to go out to Montauk with me?

747
00:50:09,752 --> 00:50:10,404
Montauk?

748
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,948
Yeah. no!
Come up to Boston with me.

749
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:14,859
Sure.
We can go next weekend.

750
00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:18,588
no. I have to go now.

751
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:21,088
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

752
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:26,405
Hi, it's Joel.

753
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:33,058
Leave me a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.

754
00:50:34,245 --> 00:50:36,950
Pick up.

755
00:50:41,794 --> 00:50:44,332
Hello? What's up?

756
00:50:44,613 --> 00:50:46,724
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

757
00:50:46,874 --> 00:50:48,571
Can you handle things tonight alone?

758
00:50:48,718 --> 00:50:50,272
I'm really sorry.

759
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,570
Don't worry.
I've got it under control.

760
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,901
He's on auto-pilot now anyway.

761
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,639
Thanks. I owe you big-time.

762
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,522
I've got to go.

763
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:14,556
Look! You and me
on the Charles River.

764
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,297
I could die right now.

765
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:17,941
I'm just happy.

766
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:19,114
I've never felt that before.

767
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:21,554
I'm exactly where I want --

768
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:24,479
I'm so excited!

769
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:26,082
I'm excited, too.

770
00:51:26,223 --> 00:51:27,576
Cool.

771
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:34,396
I got you this thing.

772
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:37,801
Happy early Valentine's Day.

773
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,235
Wow. What is it?

774
00:51:43,724 --> 00:51:45,776
I don't know. Open it up.

775
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:54,537
It's gorgeous.

776
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:55,193
You like it?

777
00:51:55,344 --> 00:51:57,776
It's just my taste, really.

778
00:51:57,919 --> 00:52:01,324
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me jewelry I liked.

779
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:04,208
Thank you.

780
00:52:13,402 --> 00:52:14,540
Joely?

781
00:52:14,688 --> 00:52:17,049
Yeah, Tangerine?

782
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:20,074
Am I ugly?

783
00:52:22,343 --> 00:52:24,525
When I was a kid I thought I was.

784
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:28,387
Can't believe I'm crying already.

785
00:52:29,127 --> 00:52:31,452
Sometimes
I think people don't understand

786
00:52:31,597 --> 00:52:34,064
how lonely it is to be a kid.

787
00:52:34,868 --> 00:52:37,335
Like you don't matter.

788
00:52:37,477 --> 00:52:40,703
So, I'm eight...

789
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:45,158
and I have these toys, these dolls.

790
00:52:45,305 --> 00:52:50,347
My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

791
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:54,203
And I keep yelling at her
You can't be ugly!

792
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:56,047
Be pretty!

793
00:52:56,613 --> 00:52:58,071
It's weird.

794
00:52:58,213 --> 00:53:00,787
Like if I can transform her...

795
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:04,231
I would magically change, too.

796
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,491
You're pretty.

797
00:53:10,634 --> 00:53:15,047
Joely. Don't ever leave me.

798
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,669
You're pretty.

799
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,356
Please let me keep this memory.

800
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:24,442
Just this one.

801
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:26,637
I want to hold your hand. Come on.

802
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:32,198
Stop it!

803
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,585
I could die right now.

804
00:53:39,372 --> 00:53:43,571
I'm just... so happy.

805
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:49,385
I've never felt that before.

806
00:53:52,244 --> 00:53:54,356
I'm just exactly...

807
00:53:56,872 --> 00:53:58,532
where I want to be.

808
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:02,327
Clem.

809
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,841
I want to call it off.

810
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:19,416
I want to call it off.

811
00:54:20,948 --> 00:54:22,157
Can you hear me?!

812
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:26,268
I want to call it off!.

813
00:54:32,464 --> 00:54:35,559
Is anybody there?!!

814
00:54:44,363 --> 00:54:45,988
Joel.

815
00:54:46,276 --> 00:54:47,308
Joel.

816
00:54:47,459 --> 00:54:48,289
I am.

817
00:54:48,434 --> 00:54:50,272
Joel.

818
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:55,697
We've got to go.
What? Where?

819
00:54:55,844 --> 00:54:57,374
I have an idea of how to stop this.

820
00:54:57,514 --> 00:54:59,067
Stop what?

821
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:01,826
Joel.
Come on.

822
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,018
Don't tickle me.

823
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,484
no! Don't!

824
00:55:06,629 --> 00:55:08,918
Smell my armpits!

825
00:55:09,065 --> 00:55:13,228
Concentrate, Clem.
We've got to get back to the office.

826
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:14,517
Halloween.

827
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:16,090
There was a tape recorder.

828
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:18,521
no, not the picture!

829
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,378
Back here.

830
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,908
Come on!

831
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:25,693
Look at me. I want to go there!

832
00:55:25,835 --> 00:55:28,681
Our files are confidential,
Mister Barish,

833
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,629
so I can't show you evidence.

834
00:55:30,775 --> 00:55:34,381
Suffice it so say that
Miss Chryzinski...

835
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:38,459
was not happy
and she wanted to move on.

836
00:55:40,794 --> 00:55:42,668
Just tell me everything you remember.

837
00:55:42,813 --> 00:55:44,545
That's what he said.

838
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:46,708
What did we see that day?

839
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:48,306
Oh, look!

840
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:50,810
We're going to see my grandma!

841
00:55:50,954 --> 00:55:52,578
no. We're not going on a train.

842
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:53,523
Joel, please.

843
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:54,676
Don't make me run!

844
00:55:54,816 --> 00:55:58,006
Come on. Mierzwiak!

845
00:55:58,642 --> 00:56:00,374
Do we always have to run?

846
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:12,727
Please?

847
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:17,080
Why don't we begin
by you telling me everything

848
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:18,087
you can remember -

849
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:21,220
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

850
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,689
I'm sorry.

851
00:56:23,832 --> 00:56:27,130
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

852
00:56:27,276 --> 00:56:30,432
You're erasing her from me.

853
00:56:30,582 --> 00:56:32,420
You're erasing me from her.

854
00:56:37,818 --> 00:56:39,206
You have this thing.

855
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:41,638
I'm in my bed. I know it.

856
00:56:41,889 --> 00:56:43,241
I'm in my brain.

857
00:56:43,385 --> 00:56:46,647
I'm part of your imagination, too.

858
00:56:46,795 --> 00:56:49,464
How can I help you from there?

859
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:51,273
I'm inside your head, too.

860
00:56:51,422 --> 00:56:52,952
I'm you!

861
00:56:55,493 --> 00:56:57,331
Sorry.

862
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:58,825
Who's that?

863
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:02,518
He works for us. That's...

864
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:08,354
Paaaaaa-trick..baaaaaby boy.

865
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:10,557
He's stealing my identity.

866
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:12,531
He stole my stuff.

867
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,060
He's seducing my girlfriend
with my words.

868
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:19,907
He stole her underwear.

869
00:57:20,055 --> 00:57:23,009
Jesus Christ.
He stole her underwear.

870
00:57:23,535 --> 00:57:27,639
I could die right now.
I'm just happy.

871
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:30,457
I've never felt that before.

872
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:32,885
I'm exactly where I want to be.

873
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:36,292
I want to go home.

874
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:40,056
What?

875
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,603
Clem!

876
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,978
Wait, Clem!

877
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:52,359
Clem, they're erasing you.

878
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:55,070
Over here!

879
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:58,404
Focus. I hired them.

880
00:57:58,551 --> 00:57:59,975
I'm sorry.
I'm so stupid.

881
00:58:00,117 --> 00:58:01,920
Sweetie, calm down.

882
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:03,204
Fnjoy the scenery.

883
00:58:03,353 --> 00:58:06,994
I need it to stop before I wake up
and don't know you any more.

884
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:12,500
Just tell them to cancel it then.

885
00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:14,267
What are you talking about?

886
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:16,635
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

887
00:58:17,096 --> 00:58:18,068
Wake yourself up.

888
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,535
Want me to wake up?

889
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,688
Okay.

890
00:58:21,828 --> 00:58:22,859
This make you happy if I try?

891
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,670
Yeah.
I'll try really hard.

892
00:58:24,819 --> 00:58:26,931
Here we go. That was a great idea.

893
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:32,567
That's working like gangbusters.

894
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:35,078
That tickles me!

895
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:37,760
What the hell is that?

896
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:40,119
It's a birthmark!

897
00:58:42,563 --> 00:58:44,959
It did work, for a second.

898
00:58:45,973 --> 00:58:47,361
See?

899
00:58:47,643 --> 00:58:49,624
But I couldn't move.

900
00:58:50,566 --> 00:58:53,483
Isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

901
00:58:53,627 --> 00:58:55,121
It's more important to prove me
wrong than to actually -

902
00:58:55,262 --> 00:58:58,382
I don't want to discuss
this right now, okay?

903
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,195
Fine.

904
00:59:02,464 --> 00:59:05,489
Then what? I'm listening.

905
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:06,566
I don't know.

906
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,574
You erased me.

907
00:59:07,717 --> 00:59:10,422
That's why I'm doing this.

908
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:12,100
I'm sorry.

909
00:59:12,241 --> 00:59:14,945
You know me. I'm impulsive.

910
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:20,339
That's what I love about you.

911
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:25,591
Joel.

912
00:59:26,888 --> 00:59:29,141
I have another idea
for this problem.

913
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,264
This is a memory of me.

914
00:59:31,411 --> 00:59:32,799
The way you wanted to...

915
00:59:32,942 --> 00:59:36,275
have sex on the couch
after you look down at my crotch.

916
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:39,026
Joel.
The eraser guys are coming here,

917
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:42,124
so what if you took me
someplace else....

918
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:46,228
somewhere where I don't belong,
and we hide there till morning?

919
00:59:52,877 --> 00:59:55,059
I can't remember anything
without you.

920
00:59:56,357 --> 00:59:57,910
That's very sweet, but try.

921
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,721
Okay.

922
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:05,500
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream...

923
01:00:05,646 --> 01:00:11,482
merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily, life is but a dream.

924
01:00:25,025 --> 01:00:26,128
It's working!

925
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,023
I'm a genius!

926
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:52,717
Joel.

927
01:00:53,937 --> 01:00:55,218
Joel.

928
01:00:56,546 --> 01:00:58,076
Where did you go?

929
01:00:58,703 --> 01:01:00,577
I'm supposed to come, too!

930
01:01:00,721 --> 01:01:02,073
I'll get a salad bowl.

931
01:01:02,217 --> 01:01:04,126
Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on ?

932
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:05,551
He just likes to be near me.

933
01:01:05,697 --> 01:01:07,357
Absolutely.

934
01:01:07,714 --> 01:01:11,013
It worked. My God!

935
01:01:11,158 --> 01:01:13,934
Look at this! It worked!

936
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:16,995
Look at this dress!

937
01:01:18,535 --> 01:01:20,551
I wish I could take it with me.

938
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:23,290
Hey, who am I?

939
01:01:23,441 --> 01:01:24,341
Mrs. Hamlyn.

940
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:25,516
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

941
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,090
I must be about four.

942
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:28,549
Oh, my gosh.

943
01:01:28,694 --> 01:01:29,666
Found the salad bowl,

944
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,859
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

945
01:01:31,999 --> 01:01:33,067
Is he okay under there?

946
01:01:33,217 --> 01:01:34,949
Honey, are you alright?

947
01:01:35,096 --> 01:01:39,888
Would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?

948
01:01:40,036 --> 01:01:41,495
not at all.

949
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:43,511
I love this kitchen.

950
01:01:43,655 --> 01:01:45,872
Thank you so much.

951
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,029
She's not looking at me.

952
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:48,484
She's busy.

953
01:01:48,629 --> 01:01:51,998
no one ever looks at me.

954
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:53,496
I want my mommy.

955
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,522
Oh, baby Joel.

956
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,743
Is every little peanut
under there okay?

957
01:01:58,893 --> 01:01:59,960
He's fine.

958
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:01,498
Do you have something to drink?

959
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:03,029
Could you drink
a cocktail at this hour?

960
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:04,144
I know it's not five, but --

961
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:05,495
I would die for a vodka.

962
01:02:05,643 --> 01:02:06,580
Let me check if I have that.

963
01:02:06,721 --> 01:02:07,587
Okay.

964
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:09,260
I'm just going to wait right here.

965
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,681
no, sweetie.

966
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:11,930
Joel?

967
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,632
Your mother wants me to mind you.

968
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:15,444
Get back under the table.

969
01:02:15,593 --> 01:02:16,280
Ice cream.

970
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:19,939
not until after
you've had your dinner.

971
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:23,723
Come on! Grow up.

972
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:25,013
Don't leave me, Clem.

973
01:02:25,161 --> 01:02:26,619
Oh, my God.

974
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:28,291
This is sort of warped.

975
01:02:28,432 --> 01:02:29,570
I'm scared.

976
01:02:29,718 --> 01:02:30,584
I want my mommy!

977
01:02:30,728 --> 01:02:32,945
Don't cry, baby Joel.

978
01:02:33,094 --> 01:02:34,517
It's okay.

979
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:37,684
Joel! Stop it!
I think it's working.

980
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:41,823
We're hidden, Joel. Look!

981
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,153
Wait there.

982
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:52,152
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

983
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,804
It stopped.

984
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:00,294
What?

985
01:03:00,578 --> 01:03:02,488
It stopped erasing.

986
01:03:02,631 --> 01:03:07,388
Oh, shit! This is terrible.

987
01:03:09,242 --> 01:03:11,151
He's off the map.

988
01:03:11,294 --> 01:03:11,946
Where?

989
01:03:12,095 --> 01:03:14,800
I don't know where!

990
01:03:14,948 --> 01:03:17,795
This is very bad news.

991
01:03:17,939 --> 01:03:19,493
Where are my glasses?

992
01:03:20,654 --> 01:03:24,687
Crap! What did we do?

993
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:26,003
What shall we do?

994
01:03:26,151 --> 01:03:27,254
I don't know what to do.

995
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:28,684
What shall we do?

996
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:30,668
I just said I don't know.

997
01:03:30,813 --> 01:03:31,323
I'm sorry.

998
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,161
What shall we do?

999
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,732
I don't know. Mellow out.

1000
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:35,606
You're freaking me out.

1001
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:37,176
We have to do something.

1002
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:39,644
He could wake up all half-baked.

1003
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:42,115
Quiet. You're freaking me out.

1004
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,336
All gooey and half-baked.

1005
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:47,784
That sounds so good. I'm hungry.

1006
01:03:47,931 --> 01:03:52,344
Oh, shit. What? What?

1007
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:53,319
We should call Howard!

1008
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:57,626
no! I can handle this.

1009
01:03:57,776 --> 01:04:00,101
You can't call Howard.

1010
01:04:01,047 --> 01:04:02,577
There's no time to fuck around.

1011
01:04:02,717 --> 01:04:04,899
I've got this under control.

1012
01:04:05,048 --> 01:04:06,436
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around!

1013
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:08,311
Okay. I'll call Howard.

1014
01:04:15,972 --> 01:04:16,624
Hello?

1015
01:04:16,772 --> 01:04:19,239
Howard? It's Stan.

1016
01:04:19,382 --> 01:04:21,114
I'm working on this guy down here...

1017
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:23,099
and we seem to have lost him
for a moment.

1018
01:04:23,244 --> 01:04:26,993
And I can't bring him back up.

1019
01:04:27,141 --> 01:04:29,466
Tell me what happened before
he disappeared.

1020
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:32,945
I wasn't sure because I was away
from the monitor for a minute...

1021
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:37,123
and I had it on auto-pilot
because I had to pee.

1022
01:04:37,265 --> 01:04:38,545
Where was Patrick?

1023
01:04:38,691 --> 01:04:41,811
Patrick? He had to go home sick

1024
01:04:44,815 --> 01:04:45,609
What's the address?

1025
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:47,830
I'm so sorry.

1026
01:04:47,981 --> 01:04:50,377
I'm at 1 59 South Village.

1027
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:52,181
Apartment 1-F.

1028
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:53,397
Rockville Center.

1029
01:04:53,548 --> 01:04:56,252
Mary? He's coming right now.

1030
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,681
I'm staying.

1031
01:04:58,001 --> 01:05:00,468
Get your stuff.
I see.

1032
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,139
I think you should go.

1033
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,739
no.

1034
01:05:06,978 --> 01:05:08,638
I am so stoned.

1035
01:05:08,787 --> 01:05:13,473
Please, you have to go.

1036
01:05:13,623 --> 01:05:15,876
I don't want him to see me stoned.

1037
01:05:16,232 --> 01:05:20,395
You have no idea how much trouble
we'd get into if Howard comes -

1038
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:23,915
Joel, stop! Look!

1039
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,468
I want her to pick me up.

1040
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,519
It's weird how strong that desire is.

1041
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,739
Look at me!

1042
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:37,513
You'll remember me in the morning...

1043
01:05:37,664 --> 01:05:38,909
and you'll come to me,

1044
01:05:39,056 --> 01:05:42,389
and you'll tell me about us,
and we'll start over.

1045
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:45,630
Pat? I thought
we could have a little cocktail.

1046
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:48,687
That Patrick guy, he's copying me.

1047
01:05:49,006 --> 01:05:50,251
What Patrick guy?

1048
01:05:50,397 --> 01:05:52,758
That guy! He's here.

1049
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:54,012
In my apartment.

1050
01:05:54,155 --> 01:05:55,578
One of the eraser guys.

1051
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,965
He fell for you
when they were doing you,

1052
01:05:57,112 --> 01:06:00,173
and now he's...introduced himself
like he doesn't know you

1053
01:06:00,313 --> 01:06:02,745
and you guys are dating.

1054
01:06:02,888 --> 01:06:06,434
Really? Is he cute?

1055
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:10,567
There's nothing wrong with you.

1056
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,357
You're the most wonderful person
I've ever met.

1057
01:06:14,822 --> 01:06:19,828
You're kind and beautiful
and smart...

1058
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:24,169
and funny and nice.

1059
01:06:24,632 --> 01:06:26,020
What?!

1060
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:29,015
Okay.

1061
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:36,461
Move! Come on, let's go!

1062
01:06:37,784 --> 01:06:39,516
I'm still stoned.

1063
01:06:40,984 --> 01:06:43,617
Those eyedrops
you gave me didn't do shit.

1064
01:06:48,777 --> 01:06:50,165
Be cool.

1065
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:55,905
Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?

1066
01:06:56,049 --> 01:06:58,196
Hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.

1067
01:06:58,345 --> 01:07:01,465
I wanted to understand as much
about the procedure as possible.

1068
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:06,338
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings of...

1069
01:07:06,487 --> 01:07:07,495
the work that we do.

1070
01:07:07,635 --> 01:07:10,790
Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...

1071
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,193
by people where I also work

1072
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,214
The work of my colleagues.

1073
01:07:15,706 --> 01:07:20,119
Let's see if we can get to
the bottom of this, shall we?

1074
01:07:25,309 --> 01:07:26,280
That's odd.

1075
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:27,667
Already tried that.

1076
01:07:27,814 --> 01:07:28,953
You tried going through the C-gate?

1077
01:07:29,101 --> 01:07:31,153
Of course.

1078
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:33,690
I mean yes.

1079
01:07:38,078 --> 01:07:39,323
Alright.

1080
01:07:41,696 --> 01:07:43,570
You want to get linked up?

1081
01:07:46,393 --> 01:07:50,142
I already ran the utility programs,
and I have nothing there...

1082
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:54,453
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1083
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:55,612
Here, Howard.

1084
01:07:55,752 --> 01:07:57,281
I got you a chair.
Thank you.

1085
01:07:57,422 --> 01:07:58,003
You're welcome.

1086
01:07:58,153 --> 01:07:59,849
Alright.

1087
01:08:00,553 --> 01:08:02,012
I've got it.

1088
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:06,421
I'm going through the entire memory,
see if something comes up.

1089
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:15,479
I love being bathed in the sink

1090
01:08:15,618 --> 01:08:18,085
Such a feeling of security.

1091
01:08:18,367 --> 01:08:21,356
I've never seen you happier,
Baby Joel.

1092
01:08:21,671 --> 01:08:22,952
There it is.

1093
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:27,334
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1094
01:08:28,386 --> 01:08:30,747
What was he doing there?

1095
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,292
His eyes are open.

1096
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,871
Has this happened before with him?

1097
01:08:45,017 --> 01:08:46,262
no.

1098
01:08:47,278 --> 01:08:49,425
This is not good.

1099
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:55,136
I'm going to have to give him this.

1100
01:09:19,496 --> 01:09:22,450
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1101
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,812
Okay. We're back in.

1102
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:32,537
That was beautiful to watch Howard,
like a surgeon or a concert pianist.

1103
01:09:34,282 --> 01:09:35,741
Thank you, Mary.

1104
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,380
Howard, you should get some sleep.

1105
01:09:38,526 --> 01:09:40,080
I think I'll be fine now.

1106
01:09:40,231 --> 01:09:44,644
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1107
01:09:45,694 --> 01:09:48,505
Lucky me. Lay one on me.

1108
01:09:53,104 --> 01:09:54,457
Don't call me Antoine.

1109
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:55,739
My name is Wally.

1110
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:56,788
Yes, I know,

1111
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:59,292
but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

1112
01:09:59,437 --> 01:10:02,627
Oh! What was that?

1113
01:10:02,777 --> 01:10:04,686
My God, there's people coming out
of your butt.

1114
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,490
There is?

1115
01:10:08,761 --> 01:10:09,520
Got it.

1116
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:13,141
Tangerine! Come on.

1117
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:14,078
We've got to go.

1118
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:17,248
Go on. Please go.

1119
01:10:19,894 --> 01:10:21,910
You can run, but you can't hide.

1120
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,526
Clem, come on! There I am.

1121
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:29,494
Doc?

1122
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:31,827
Please?

1123
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:38,257
Let's begin by telling me
everything you remember -

1124
01:10:38,543 --> 01:10:39,088
That's strange.

1125
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:42,085
He's in a memory we've already eased.

1126
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,080
At least we know where he is.

1127
01:10:45,222 --> 01:10:47,060
He's back on track, right?

1128
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:48,073
Come on, Clem.

1129
01:10:48,215 --> 01:10:50,326
Seems he's developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.

1130
01:10:50,476 --> 01:10:52,588
I don't want to run any more.

1131
01:10:53,538 --> 01:10:54,926
Shit!

1132
01:10:56,147 --> 01:10:56,906
Come on...

1133
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,625
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1134
01:10:59,766 --> 01:11:00,525
Where?

1135
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,686
Hide me in your humiliation.

1136
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:07,376
Come on, you big baby.

1137
01:11:15,144 --> 01:11:16,567
no!!

1138
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:20,391
Bye, Howard.

1139
01:11:21,024 --> 01:11:23,005
Wait! He's disappeared again.

1140
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,159
Oh, dear.

1141
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,595
I'm so sorry.

1142
01:11:27,738 --> 01:11:32,744
Humiliation.

1143
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,417
Joel.

1144
01:11:36,332 --> 01:11:37,470
I don't like it either.

1145
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:40,217
I'm just trying
to find horrible secret places to -

1146
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:41,576
Honey, I have a surprise.

1147
01:11:41,724 --> 01:11:46,280
You know what?
I'll just ask you in the morning.

1148
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:48,013
Goodnight.

1149
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:54,521
I'm sorry Joel.
Shut up.

1150
01:11:55,815 --> 01:12:02,659
Joel, look where we are!

1151
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:07,565
This isn't good.

1152
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:12,056
Hide me somewhere really buried.

1153
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:14,740
Hit it, Joel!

1154
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:17,027
I can't. I've got to go home.

1155
01:12:17,177 --> 01:12:19,158
I'll do it later!

1156
01:12:38,608 --> 01:12:39,712
He has a girlfriend.

1157
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:41,177
What am I doing?

1158
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:44,134
Freddy, you don't scare me anymore!

1159
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:48,173
Joel, get up.

1160
01:12:48,316 --> 01:12:50,048
Come on. They're not worth it.

1161
01:12:50,194 --> 01:12:55,022
He's not listening! Come on.

1162
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,450
Stupid!

1163
01:13:03,102 --> 01:13:04,454
I'm so ashamed.

1164
01:13:04,598 --> 01:13:06,330
It's okay.

1165
01:13:06,477 --> 01:13:08,101
You were a little kid.

1166
01:13:08,703 --> 01:13:09,462
Come on.

1167
01:13:09,608 --> 01:13:11,684
That's where I live - lived.

1168
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:13,602
I wish I knew you when I was a kid.

1169
01:13:13,749 --> 01:13:14,887
Do you like my pink hat?

1170
01:13:15,035 --> 01:13:16,044
Look, feel better.

1171
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:18,686
You can really kill me this time.
Go.

1172
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:21,153
You're really going to die,
though, right?

1173
01:13:21,298 --> 01:13:22,852
One two three...

1174
01:13:23,003 --> 01:13:24,462
You're dead.

1175
01:13:25,403 --> 01:13:26,933
Oh, my mom.

1176
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:28,141
It's okay!

1177
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:28,979
We're playing.

1178
01:13:29,127 --> 01:13:32,081
It's not real.
He's killing me.

1179
01:13:32,222 --> 01:13:33,432
Are you dead yet?

1180
01:13:33,753 --> 01:13:35,212
You're dead!

1181
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,405
I think I got the hang of this.

1182
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,004
I still don't understand it...

1183
01:13:39,146 --> 01:13:41,649
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1184
01:14:16,687 --> 01:14:18,490
Joel.

1185
01:14:18,879 --> 01:14:20,337
Are you okay?

1186
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,147
Joel...

1187
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,018
Oh my God, that was terrible.

1188
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:29,241
Almost three seconds.
Alright.

1189
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:30,180
Let me be it one more time..

1190
01:14:30,325 --> 01:14:32,651
One more, then I get to go.

1191
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:46,462
Oh, shit!

1192
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:47,852
This is so cool!

1193
01:14:47,999 --> 01:14:49,696
Look out!

1194
01:14:51,896 --> 01:14:53,390
It's fluff!.

1195
01:14:56,662 --> 01:14:58,085
Our house!

1196
01:15:03,064 --> 01:15:04,594
We've got to go!

1197
01:15:06,891 --> 01:15:08,172
Come on!

1198
01:15:10,858 --> 01:15:13,360
Clem, we've got to go.

1199
01:15:16,633 --> 01:15:19,302
This is a really bad time for this!

1200
01:15:21,087 --> 01:15:22,996
I don't even know where we're going.

1201
01:15:23,139 --> 01:15:24,348
It's going to be fun.

1202
01:15:24,496 --> 01:15:26,477
It's the best place - this way.
no, this way.

1203
01:15:26,618 --> 01:15:29,156
This way. Come on.

1204
01:15:29,297 --> 01:15:30,850
You're no help at all.

1205
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,294
Come on.

1206
01:15:35,003 --> 01:15:37,291
Let go of me, Joel!

1207
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,555
I like watching you work, Howard.

1208
01:15:56,947 --> 01:16:01,598
I guess I'll go out for some air.

1209
01:16:01,749 --> 01:16:03,338
If nobody minds.

1210
01:16:03,488 --> 01:16:06,478
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

1211
01:16:09,195 --> 01:16:10,962
That's fine.

1212
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:22,727
Do you like quotes?

1213
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,378
What do you mean?

1214
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,192
Famous quotes.

1215
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:31,521
I find reading them inspirational...

1216
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:36,711
and I've come across some
I thought you might like, too.

1217
01:16:37,585 --> 01:16:39,174
I'd love to hear some.

1218
01:16:39,324 --> 01:16:41,127
Blessed are the forgetful,

1219
01:16:41,273 --> 01:16:44,784
for they get the better even
of their blunders.

1220
01:16:45,378 --> 01:16:46,623
That's nietzsche, right?

1221
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:49,343
Yeah. And I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.

1222
01:16:49,483 --> 01:16:51,986
It's a good quote.

1223
01:16:52,127 --> 01:16:54,310
I'm happy we both know it.

1224
01:16:55,746 --> 01:16:56,920
There's this other one I like.

1225
01:16:57,068 --> 01:16:59,535
It's by Pope Alexander, and it goes -

1226
01:16:59,678 --> 01:17:01,445
Alexander Pope?

1227
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:02,421
Oh, yeah.

1228
01:17:02,565 --> 01:17:03,633
Shit.

1229
01:17:03,783 --> 01:17:07,009
It's just that I told myself not
to say Pope Alexander ...

1230
01:17:07,157 --> 01:17:09,339
and sound like a dope,
and then I go ahead and say it.

1231
01:17:09,489 --> 01:17:11,113
It's no big deal.

1232
01:17:11,263 --> 01:17:12,888
You're such a sweetheart.

1233
01:17:15,473 --> 01:17:16,576
The quote goes

1234
01:17:16,725 --> 01:17:19,571
How happy is the blameless
vestal's lot!

1235
01:17:20,483 --> 01:17:23,056
The world forgetting,
by the world forgot:

1236
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:27,225
Fternal sunshine of the spotless mind!

1237
01:17:28,136 --> 01:17:31,956
Fach prayer accepted
and each wish resign'd.

1238
01:17:32,103 --> 01:17:36,931
I want to be a huge elephant.

1239
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:39,819
With a huge trunk, like that.

1240
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:42,982
Clementine?

1241
01:17:43,967 --> 01:17:45,520
I haven't heard that one.

1242
01:17:45,672 --> 01:17:46,703
It's lovely.

1243
01:17:46,855 --> 01:17:49,702
I just thought it
would be appropriate, maybe.

1244
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:57,003
I really admire the work you do

1245
01:17:58,197 --> 01:17:59,512
I don't mean to be so familiar -

1246
01:17:59,658 --> 01:18:03,264
It's fine.
I'm happy to hear -

1247
01:18:09,087 --> 01:18:10,581
I'm sorry.

1248
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,904
I've loved you for a very long time.

1249
01:18:19,768 --> 01:18:21,227
I shouldn't have said that.

1250
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:25,365
Mary, you're a wonderful girl.

1251
01:18:25,508 --> 01:18:31,665
But you know I have a wife and kids.

1252
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:33,329
Mary.

1253
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:38,549
Oh. Mary we can't do this.

1254
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:57,062
Good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak

1255
01:19:06,389 --> 01:19:08,642
Oh my God.
Who is it?

1256
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:24,341
Thanks a lot, Stan.

1257
01:19:29,838 --> 01:19:31,855
Hollis!

1258
01:19:32,795 --> 01:19:34,254
Hollis!

1259
01:19:35,197 --> 01:19:37,450
Wait.

1260
01:19:38,397 --> 01:19:39,333
I knew it, Howard.

1261
01:19:39,476 --> 01:19:40,935
It didn't start out like this.

1262
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:42,180
I came here to work!

1263
01:19:42,329 --> 01:19:44,440
This is a one-time mistake.

1264
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,464
it's true!
I'm a stupid girl with a crush!

1265
01:19:46,608 --> 01:19:49,455
I basically forced him into it!

1266
01:19:50,505 --> 01:19:51,572
Don't be a monster.

1267
01:19:51,723 --> 01:19:53,704
Tell the girl.

1268
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:57,873
Tell me what?

1269
01:19:58,298 --> 01:19:59,994
Oh, you poor kid.

1270
01:20:01,812 --> 01:20:03,650
You can have him.

1271
01:20:03,934 --> 01:20:05,666
You did.

1272
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:17,118
What?!

1273
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,157
We have a history.

1274
01:20:30,689 --> 01:20:31,827
I'm sorry.

1275
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:35,559
You wanted the procedure done.

1276
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:42,377
You wanted it done
so you could get past...

1277
01:20:48,294 --> 01:20:51,211
I have to finish the work in there.

1278
01:20:51,355 --> 01:20:53,372
It's almost morning.

1279
01:20:54,905 --> 01:20:56,601
We'll talk later.

1280
01:20:57,792 --> 01:20:59,524
Okay?

1281
01:21:16,753 --> 01:21:19,079
Let me give you a lift home.

1282
01:21:30,983 --> 01:21:31,778
Hi.

1283
01:21:31,923 --> 01:21:33,239
Hi.

1284
01:21:34,567 --> 01:21:38,173
Didn't figure you'd
show your face around me again.

1285
01:21:38,777 --> 01:21:41,896
I thought you were humiliated.

1286
01:21:42,046 --> 01:21:44,335
You did run away, after all.

1287
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,949
I just needed to see you, and...

1288
01:21:49,006 --> 01:21:54,735
I'd like to take you out
or something.

1289
01:21:54,885 --> 01:21:56,130
You're married.

1290
01:21:57,356 --> 01:21:58,423
not yet.

1291
01:21:58,573 --> 01:22:02,287
no, I'm not married.

1292
01:22:02,435 --> 01:22:04,487
Look, I'm telling you right
off the bat

1293
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:06,180
I'm high maintenance, so...

1294
01:22:06,331 --> 01:22:09,700
I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage or...

1295
01:22:09,845 --> 01:22:11,921
whatever it is you've got
going there.

1296
01:22:12,072 --> 01:22:14,539
If you want to be with me,
you're with me.

1297
01:22:15,378 --> 01:22:16,658
Okay.

1298
01:22:17,256 --> 01:22:21,253
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them, or...

1299
01:22:21,396 --> 01:22:23,614
I'm gonna make them alive.

1300
01:22:23,762 --> 01:22:26,953
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's...
looking for my own peace of mind.

1301
01:22:27,102 --> 01:22:28,834
Don't assign me yours.

1302
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:31,199
I remember that speech really well.

1303
01:22:31,904 --> 01:22:33,706
I had you pegged, didn't I?

1304
01:22:33,851 --> 01:22:35,903
You had the whole human race pegged.

1305
01:22:36,183 --> 01:22:37,392
Probably.

1306
01:22:39,662 --> 01:22:42,129
I still thought you
were going to save my life.

1307
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:43,801
Fven after that.

1308
01:22:45,611 --> 01:22:46,963
I know.

1309
01:22:49,543 --> 01:22:55,664
It would be different if we could
just give it another go-round.

1310
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,910
Remember me.

1311
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:03,802
Try your best.

1312
01:23:06,312 --> 01:23:07,866
Maybe we can.

1313
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:44,685
Just tell me what you remember,
and we'll take it from there.

1314
01:23:44,827 --> 01:23:46,107
Okay.

1315
01:23:47,367 --> 01:23:50,036
I liked you immediately.

1316
01:23:50,289 --> 01:23:52,365
You didn't come on to me at all.

1317
01:23:52,864 --> 01:23:54,488
I liked that.

1318
01:23:56,099 --> 01:23:58,732
I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.

1319
01:23:58,883 --> 01:24:01,315
But I wanted you to think
I was smart.

1320
01:24:02,953 --> 01:24:05,100
I couldn't wait to come to work

1321
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:07,326
I had these fantasies of...

1322
01:24:07,476 --> 01:24:12,233
us being married and having kids
and just...

1323
01:24:12,382 --> 01:24:14,671
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1324
01:24:15,061 --> 01:24:17,634
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

1325
01:24:17,775 --> 01:24:19,198
I know.

1326
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:22,078
Oh, God!

1327
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:24,554
I'll take the bottom and you

1328
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:26,715
Joel...help me with that.

1329
01:24:26,855 --> 01:24:28,622
Will you get the cooler?

1330
01:24:28,768 --> 01:24:29,978
She can get it.

1331
01:24:30,126 --> 01:24:32,344
Let me get that.

1332
01:24:32,492 --> 01:24:33,915
no, no, no!

1333
01:24:34,057 --> 01:24:35,587
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.

1334
01:24:35,727 --> 01:24:38,609
Put the gate back up.

1335
01:24:41,642 --> 01:24:43,374
This is the day we met.

1336
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:44,972
You were down by the surf.

1337
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:47,517
I could just make you out
in the distance.

1338
01:24:47,661 --> 01:24:49,915
I remember being drawn to you,
even then.

1339
01:24:50,305 --> 01:24:52,001
I thought Wow. How odd.

1340
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:54,510
I'm drawn to someone's back

1341
01:24:54,862 --> 01:24:56,630
You were in that orange sweatshirt...

1342
01:24:56,777 --> 01:24:58,650
I would come to know so well.

1343
01:24:58,794 --> 01:25:00,526
And even hate, eventually.

1344
01:25:00,986 --> 01:25:04,805
But at the time I thought
How cool, an orange sweatshirt.

1345
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:06,233
Hi, there.

1346
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:09,605
Hi.

1347
01:25:09,753 --> 01:25:12,743
I saw you sitting over here.

1348
01:25:12,884 --> 01:25:14,581
By yourself.

1349
01:25:14,799 --> 01:25:17,539
And I thought Thank God...

1350
01:25:17,686 --> 01:25:18,967
someone normal who doesn't know

1351
01:25:19,112 --> 01:25:21,650
how to interact
at these things either.

1352
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:25,827
I don't ever know what to say.

1353
01:25:25,966 --> 01:25:27,555
I'm Clementine.

1354
01:25:28,715 --> 01:25:31,941
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?

1355
01:25:32,473 --> 01:25:36,186
And then you just took it,
without waiting for an answer.

1356
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:44,856
It was so intimate,
like we were already lovers.

1357
01:25:46,807 --> 01:25:48,337
I'm Joel.

1358
01:25:48,964 --> 01:25:50,352
Hi, Joel.

1359
01:25:51,086 --> 01:25:53,233
no jokes about my name.

1360
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:58,772
Like Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin',
oh, my darlin' Clementine?

1361
01:25:58,915 --> 01:26:01,204
Huckleberry Hound?
That sort of thing?

1362
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:03,366
Yeah. Like that.

1363
01:26:03,507 --> 01:26:05,796
no, no jokes.

1364
01:26:06,011 --> 01:26:07,708
One of my favorite things

1365
01:26:07,856 --> 01:26:10,667
when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1366
01:26:13,422 --> 01:26:15,439
I think your name is magical.

1367
01:26:18,711 --> 01:26:20,240
This is it, Joel.

1368
01:26:21,111 --> 01:26:22,665
It's gonna be gone soon.

1369
01:26:25,356 --> 01:26:26,708
I know.

1370
01:26:27,826 --> 01:26:29,380
What do we do?

1371
01:26:32,175 --> 01:26:33,598
Fnjoy it.

1372
01:26:51,033 --> 01:26:52,041
You married?

1373
01:26:52,181 --> 01:26:52,904
no.

1374
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:55,375
Let's move into this neighborhood.

1375
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,581
I do sort of live with someone,
though.

1376
01:26:58,721 --> 01:27:00,074
Male or female?

1377
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:04,322
What? Female.

1378
01:27:06,341 --> 01:27:09,116
At least I'm not barking up
the wrong tree.

1379
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:14,063
Do you know these people?

1380
01:27:14,412 --> 01:27:16,429
Of course not. Come on.

1381
01:27:18,379 --> 01:27:19,695
They might have a dog.

1382
01:27:20,396 --> 01:27:21,855
There's no dog.

1383
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:24,564
What are you doing?

1384
01:27:25,268 --> 01:27:27,379
It's freezing out.

1385
01:27:27,807 --> 01:27:29,195
I don't believe this.

1386
01:27:41,794 --> 01:27:44,427
Come on. The water's fine.

1387
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:48,088
nobody's coming here tonight,
believe me.

1388
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:56,996
So what's your girlfriend's name?

1389
01:27:57,728 --> 01:28:00,398
naomi, but we're not really...

1390
01:28:01,764 --> 01:28:02,665
Whatever.

1391
01:28:02,807 --> 01:28:03,839
So this is great.

1392
01:28:03,991 --> 01:28:05,580
now I can look for...

1393
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:09,313
candles, matches,
and the liquor cabinet.

1394
01:28:09,453 --> 01:28:11,042
Oh, God.

1395
01:28:17,734 --> 01:28:18,706
I think we should go.

1396
01:28:18,846 --> 01:28:20,020
There's no phone line.

1397
01:28:21,038 --> 01:28:21,833
What?

1398
01:28:21,978 --> 01:28:22,737
I think we should go.

1399
01:28:22,883 --> 01:28:25,456
Why? It's our house.

1400
01:28:25,596 --> 01:28:26,568
Just for tonight.

1401
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:30,292
We are...David and Ruth Laskin!

1402
01:28:31,059 --> 01:28:32,826
Which one...do you want to be?

1403
01:28:33,146 --> 01:28:36,787
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1404
01:28:38,748 --> 01:28:39,815
What do you need?

1405
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,269
Alcohol.

1406
01:28:44,315 --> 01:28:46,462
So, are you okay with wine?

1407
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:47,757
I don't know...

1408
01:28:47,897 --> 01:28:49,250
Well, you choose the wine.

1409
01:28:49,394 --> 01:28:53,913
I'll go find the bedroom
and slip into something more Ruth.

1410
01:28:56,944 --> 01:28:58,083
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.

1411
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,519
I've got to catch my ride.

1412
01:29:06,406 --> 01:29:07,901
So go.

1413
01:29:09,086 --> 01:29:10,545
I did.

1414
01:29:11,382 --> 01:29:13,565
I thought maybe you were a nut.

1415
01:29:14,235 --> 01:29:15,967
But you were exciting.

1416
01:29:18,202 --> 01:29:19,862
I wish you'd stayed!

1417
01:29:20,011 --> 01:29:21,256
I wish I'd stayed, too.

1418
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:22,861
now I wish I'd stayed.

1419
01:29:23,002 --> 01:29:25,054
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1420
01:29:27,073 --> 01:29:33,954
I wish I'd stayed.

1421
01:29:34,693 --> 01:29:35,523
I do.

1422
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:37,399
I came back downstairs,
and you were gone.

1423
01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:39,907
I walked out the door.

1424
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:40,736
Why?

1425
01:29:40,886 --> 01:29:41,822
I don't know.

1426
01:29:41,964 --> 01:29:44,075
I felt like a scared little kid.

1427
01:29:44,226 --> 01:29:46,551
It was above my head.
I don't know.

1428
01:29:46,904 --> 01:29:48,743
You were scared?

1429
01:29:51,358 --> 01:29:53,054
Thought you knew that about me.

1430
01:29:54,246 --> 01:29:55,776
I ran back to the bonfire,

1431
01:29:55,915 --> 01:29:58,585
trying to outrun my humiliation,
I think

1432
01:29:59,012 --> 01:30:00,566
Was it something I said?

1433
01:30:00,717 --> 01:30:02,211
Yeah.

1434
01:30:04,683 --> 01:30:09,167
You said So go with such disdain.

1435
01:30:09,624 --> 01:30:11,320
I'm sorry.

1436
01:30:11,467 --> 01:30:13,021
It's okay.

1437
01:30:18,182 --> 01:30:19,356
Joel.

1438
01:30:20,757 --> 01:30:22,417
What if you stayed this time?

1439
01:30:25,489 --> 01:30:27,221
I walked out the door.

1440
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:29,938
There's no memory left.

1441
01:30:30,081 --> 01:30:32,619
Come back and make up a goodbye,
at least.

1442
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:35,115
Let's pretend we had one.

1443
01:30:46,364 --> 01:30:47,858
Bye, Joel.

1444
01:30:49,112 --> 01:30:50,642
I love you.

1445
01:30:50,991 --> 01:30:54,360
Meet me in Montauk

1446
01:30:59,097 --> 01:31:00,556
I didn't crash the plane.

1447
01:31:00,698 --> 01:31:01,563
The plane crashed.

1448
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:03,819
I didn't do it.

1449
01:31:03,968 --> 01:31:06,435
You were operating the plane
with the remote control,

1450
01:31:06,578 --> 01:31:07,752
and it crashed.

1451
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,667
It was fucking windy. Come on.

1452
01:31:09,813 --> 01:31:11,343
You're stoned and you're driving.

1453
01:31:11,484 --> 01:31:13,809
The pot balances it out
and brings you back up.

1454
01:31:13,954 --> 01:31:14,819
That's why I smoke it.

1455
01:31:14,962 --> 01:31:15,934
If I'm going to be drinking, then

1456
01:31:16,076 --> 01:31:17,250
I'll smoke it.

1457
01:31:17,398 --> 01:31:19,022
It does.

1458
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:22,719
A medical test was done
by the Science network

1459
01:31:22,861 --> 01:31:24,593
Honey, just watch the road.

1460
01:31:24,739 --> 01:31:26,850
I can't see shit.

1461
01:31:28,114 --> 01:31:31,103
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.

1462
01:31:31,245 --> 01:31:32,253
She was nice.

1463
01:31:32,393 --> 01:31:34,196
Who was it?

1464
01:31:36,255 --> 01:31:39,861
She was just a girl.

1465
01:32:25,312 --> 01:32:28,087
So I've got to drop the van off.

1466
01:32:28,407 --> 01:32:30,067
Thanks, Stan.

1467
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,741
We'll talk

1468
01:33:58,292 --> 01:33:59,916
You've got a lot of your stuff there.
That's right.

1469
01:34:00,066 --> 01:34:01,763
I take it you're not coming back

1470
01:34:02,919 --> 01:34:04,449
I wouldn't come back if I was you.

1471
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,728
Do you swear you didn't know?

1472
01:34:05,876 --> 01:34:07,335
I swear.

1473
01:34:08,382 --> 01:34:10,149
So you didn't do the erasing?

1474
01:34:10,295 --> 01:34:11,327
Of course not.

1475
01:34:11,478 --> 01:34:14,183
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1476
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:16,963
Once, maybe.

1477
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:24,271
I was coming back from a job,
and I saw you two talking.

1478
01:34:24,421 --> 01:34:27,303
So I waved to you, and you giggled.

1479
01:34:28,109 --> 01:34:29,603
How did I look?

1480
01:34:31,831 --> 01:34:33,290
You looked happy.

1481
01:34:33,779 --> 01:34:36,733
Happy with a secret.

1482
01:34:37,746 --> 01:34:38,991
And after that?

1483
01:34:39,138 --> 01:34:41,356
I never saw you two together again
like that...

1484
01:34:41,504 --> 01:34:45,881
so I just figured
I was imagining things.

1485
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:13,715
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1486
01:35:14,904 --> 01:35:16,362
You know that?

1487
01:35:27,707 --> 01:35:29,060
Thanks.

1488
01:36:03,542 --> 01:36:05,238
Let me get my toothbrush.

1489
01:36:20,382 --> 01:36:21,627
Where are you, Clem?

1490
01:36:21,774 --> 01:36:23,398
I'm worried.

1491
01:36:23,547 --> 01:36:29,740
I feel like you're mad at me
and I don't know what I did.

1492
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,789
I love you so much.

1493
01:36:32,176 --> 01:36:34,323
I'll do anything to make you happy.

1494
01:36:34,472 --> 01:36:36,903
Just tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

1495
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:42,327
I'm going to stop by this morning,
just to make sure you're okay.

1496
01:36:54,234 --> 01:36:55,859
Vamonos, senor.

1497
01:36:57,366 --> 01:36:59,904
I had a really nice time last night.

1498
01:37:00,879 --> 01:37:02,089
nice?

1499
01:37:02,236 --> 01:37:07,348
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life last night.

1500
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:09,019
That's better.

1501
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:14,167
This is weird.

1502
01:37:14,309 --> 01:37:16,811
To all patients of Doctor
Howard Mierzwiak..

1503
01:37:16,953 --> 01:37:18,162
My name is Mary Svevo.

1504
01:37:18,309 --> 01:37:20,254
We've met, but you don't remember me.

1505
01:37:20,397 --> 01:37:24,988
I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased.

1506
01:37:25,129 --> 01:37:28,319
I've since decided that
this is a horrible...

1507
01:37:28,469 --> 01:37:29,440
To correct this,

1508
01:37:29,582 --> 01:37:32,180
I'm sending everyone's file back
to them.

1509
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:36,261
My name is Clementine Kruscynski.

1510
01:37:36,401 --> 01:37:39,391
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1511
01:37:39,533 --> 01:37:40,956
What is this?

1512
01:37:41,099 --> 01:37:41,715
I don't know.

1513
01:37:41,864 --> 01:37:42,765
He's boring.

1514
01:37:42,908 --> 01:37:46,063
Is that enough reason
to erase someone?

1515
01:37:46,212 --> 01:37:50,340
I've been thinking how I was before
and how I am now, and he changed me.

1516
01:37:50,493 --> 01:37:52,225
I feel like I'm always pissy.

1517
01:37:52,371 --> 01:37:55,810
I don't like myself when I'm with him.

1518
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:58,030
I can't stand to even look at him.

1519
01:37:58,182 --> 01:38:00,399
That pathetic, wimpy,
apologetic smile.

1520
01:38:02,844 --> 01:38:03,638
What are you doing?

1521
01:38:03,783 --> 01:38:04,435
I'm not doing anything.

1522
01:38:04,583 --> 01:38:06,279
The bloom is certainly
off the rose at this point.

1523
01:38:06,426 --> 01:38:07,742
Are you screwing with me?

1524
01:38:07,888 --> 01:38:09,204
no!

1525
01:38:09,349 --> 01:38:10,417
You are screwing with me.

1526
01:38:10,567 --> 01:38:11,598
I'm not!

1527
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,174
You clearly are!

1528
01:38:13,315 --> 01:38:17,622
Let's just take a minute and just...

1529
01:38:46,855 --> 01:38:49,358
Patrick, get the fuck away!

1530
01:38:49,568 --> 01:38:50,220
Can we talk about it?

1531
01:38:50,369 --> 01:38:52,243
no! Get the fuck away!

1532
01:39:27,074 --> 01:39:28,568
Hey, Clementine.

1533
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:29,777
Hey.

1534
01:39:29,926 --> 01:39:31,658
nice to see you.

1535
01:39:34,624 --> 01:39:35,798
Yes.

1536
01:39:36,189 --> 01:39:41,824
...and she's smart,
I think, but not educated.

1537
01:39:42,139 --> 01:39:44,570
I couldn't talk to her about books.

1538
01:39:44,713 --> 01:39:47,703
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.

1539
01:39:48,227 --> 01:39:51,145
Her vocabulary leaves something
to be desired.

1540
01:39:51,707 --> 01:39:54,661
The truth is,
I was embarrassed in public...

1541
01:39:54,803 --> 01:39:59,145
because she would pronounce
'library' 'li-berry'.

1542
01:40:03,571 --> 01:40:04,745
Look what I found.

1543
01:40:04,893 --> 01:40:08,570
I think if there's a truly
seductive quality about Clementine...

1544
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:14,034
it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane...

1545
01:40:14,182 --> 01:40:15,676
Made me look skinny.

1546
01:40:15,817 --> 01:40:20,444
...amazing, burning meteorite
will carry you to another world,

1547
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:23,324
where things are exciting.

1548
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:29,412
But what you quickly learn is that
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1549
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,813
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1550
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,560
It's okay.

1551
01:40:38,884 --> 01:40:40,164
I really like you.

1552
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,362
I hate that
I said mean things about you.

1553
01:40:42,502 --> 01:40:43,996
Let me turn this off.

1554
01:40:44,138 --> 01:40:46,949
Hey, that's only fair.

1555
01:40:50,401 --> 01:40:53,805
The whole thing with the hair,
it's all bullshit.

1556
01:40:53,949 --> 01:40:54,980
I really like your hair.

1557
01:40:55,131 --> 01:40:56,103
Thank you.

1558
01:40:56,245 --> 01:40:57,870
I really like your hair.
Thank you.

1559
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:59,549
I do.

1560
01:41:02,577 --> 01:41:04,237
You want a drink or something?

1561
01:41:04,387 --> 01:41:05,976
Do you have any whiskey?

1562
01:41:07,656 --> 01:41:12,627
I didn't think her sex was motivated.

1563
01:41:12,771 --> 01:41:15,344
I saw it clearly the last night
we were together.

1564
01:41:15,485 --> 01:41:16,695
It wasn't sexy.

1565
01:41:16,842 --> 01:41:19,582
It was just...sad.

1566
01:41:20,182 --> 01:41:22,649
Sorry, I thought there was more.

1567
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:28,320
The only way she can get people
to like her is to fuck them.

1568
01:41:28,741 --> 01:41:32,703
Or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of them.

1569
01:41:32,846 --> 01:41:35,516
I think she's so desperate
and insecure...

1570
01:41:35,665 --> 01:41:40,600
that she'll sooner or later go
around fucking everybody.

1571
01:41:40,744 --> 01:41:41,716
I don't do that.

1572
01:41:41,857 --> 01:41:44,431
I wouldn't think that about you.

1573
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:45,021
Because I don't.

1574
01:41:45,163 --> 01:41:46,551
I know.

1575
01:41:47,042 --> 01:41:49,959
It really hurts me that you said that,
because I don't do that.

1576
01:41:50,103 --> 01:41:51,004
I'm so sorry.

1577
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:52,914
I'm sorry about all this.

1578
01:41:53,234 --> 01:41:54,373
I'm going to go.

1579
01:41:54,521 --> 01:41:55,386
I'm a little confused.

1580
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:58,935
I don't really think I can be here.

1581
01:42:05,133 --> 01:42:06,271
Bye.

1582
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,524
Bye.

1583
01:42:07,673 --> 01:42:08,681
I really thought I knew her so well.
It was nice meeting you.

1584
01:42:08,821 --> 01:42:10,873
But I didn't know her at all.

1585
01:42:14,144 --> 01:42:17,204
What a loss to spend
that much time with someone...

1586
01:42:17,345 --> 01:42:20,121
only to find out
that she's a stranger.

1587
01:42:24,755 --> 01:42:26,179
Wait!

1588
01:42:28,756 --> 01:42:29,099
What?

1589
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:31,948
I don't know. Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?

1590
01:42:32,096 --> 01:42:36,544
I want you to wait for...
just a...while.

1591
01:42:50,432 --> 01:42:51,571
Okay.

1592
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:52,999
Really?

1593
01:42:53,319 --> 01:42:57,210
I'm not a concept, just a fucked-up
girl looking for peace of mind.

1594
01:42:57,356 --> 01:42:58,672
I'm not perfect.

1595
01:42:58,817 --> 01:43:01,414
I can't see anything that
I don't like about you right now.

1596
01:43:01,565 --> 01:43:05,800
But you will think of things.

1597
01:43:05,949 --> 01:43:07,194
And I'll get bored with you...

1598
01:43:07,341 --> 01:43:10,567
and feel trapped,
because that's what happens with me.

1599
01:43:11,654 --> 01:43:13,149
Okay.

1600
01:43:17,256 --> 01:43:18,880
Okay.

1601
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:26,813
Okay.
Okay.
