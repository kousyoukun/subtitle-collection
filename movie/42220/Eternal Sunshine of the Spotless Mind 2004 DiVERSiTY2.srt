1
00:00:00,771 --> 00:00:02,398
You still need to fill the form out.

2
00:00:02,616 --> 00:00:03,173
Really?

3
00:00:03,346 --> 00:00:04,813
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,895 --> 00:00:08,123
I don't have a pen.

5
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:09,845
There's a pen right there.

6
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:13,184
Good morning. Lacuna.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,304
Oh, that offer expired
after the New Year.

8
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,238
Mister Barish?

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,380
How are we today?

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,428
Not too good, actually.

11
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:27,550
Oh my God! Stan!

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,704
Sorry. I was just

13
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:31,791
I'm working.

14
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:34,965
Here, Doctor.

15
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:36,373
Thank you.

16
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,822
You should not have seen this.

17
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,669
I apologize.

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,602
This is a hoax, right?

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,528
I mean, this is Clem's

20
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:49,606
I assure you, no.

21
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:58,618
There's no such thing as this.

22
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:05,529
Our files are confidential,
so I can't show you evidence.

23
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:11,362
Suffice it to say
that Miss Kruczynski was not happy...

24
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,976
and she wanted to move on.

25
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:16,377
We provide that possibility.

26
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:20,053
...was not happy,
and wanted to move on.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,672
We provide that possibility.

28
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,095
What the hell is that?

29
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:27,579
I'm the nicest guy
she ever went out with.

30
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,253
Ah, fuck!

31
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,777
Rob, give it a rest!

32
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:33,663
It's okay.

33
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,808
I am making a birdhouse.

34
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:42,499
Joel, you know Clementine's
just like that.

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,748
So impulsive.

36
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,373
She decided to erase you as a lark

37
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,802
Alark?

38
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:01,604
Why did you do that?

39
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:02,708
Wait, wait!

40
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,552
I want it done. Now.

41
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,704
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time -

42
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:10,878
That's okay, Mary.

43
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,068
But there are people waiting.

44
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:15,082
Mister Barish,
if you'd like to come inside.

45
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,575
Mary, if you'd take care of Mrs. Woo.

46
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:19,476
Goodbye, Mrs. Woo.
Of course.

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,430
The first thing we need you to do,
Mister Barish...

48
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:33,144
is to go home and collect everything
you own that has...

49
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,997
some association with Clementine.

50
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:37,795
Anything.

51
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:41,781
We'll use these items...

52
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:45,989
to create a map of Clementine
in your brain.

53
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:50,805
We'll need photos, clothing...

54
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:54,082
gifts,
books she may have bought you...

55
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:58,909
CD's you may have bought together,
journal entries...

56
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:01,325
We want to empty your home...

57
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:05,097
We want to empty your life
of Clementine.

58
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:06,810
After the mapping is done,

59
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:10,344
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

60
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,622
That way, when you awake
in the morning,

61
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,128
you'll find yourself in your...

62
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:20,889
own bed, as if nothing has happened,
a new life awaiting you.

63
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:27,142
Wake up, buddy!

64
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,379
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

65
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:37,867
You can't have the procedure
done three times in one month.

66
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,889
It's just not our policy here.

67
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:43,007
How are you today, Mister Barish?

68
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,243
I know it's an emergency.

69
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,667
We'll do everything we can.

70
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:50,493
We can fit you in on March 1st.

71
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,177
Maybe you could talk to the Doctor.

72
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:58,099
What day would you like to come
in this week?

73
00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:59,797
Mister Barish!

74
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,115
February is very busy for us because
of Valentine's Day.

75
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:18,430
This is Stan Fink,

76
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:21,913
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

77
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:25,435
He'll be handling your case tonight.

78
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,644
Great to meet you, Mister Barish.

79
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,086
My name is Joel Barish...

80
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:34,797
and I'm here
to erase Clementine Kruczynski.

81
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:40,079
Very good.
Now tell me about Clementine.

82
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:46,770
I was living with this woman, Naomi...

83
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:51,237
a couple years ago, and my friends,
Rob and Carrie...

84
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,358
invited us to this party
at the beach.

85
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:54,738
I don't like parties.

86
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:58,029
And Naomi couldn't go,
but I went...

87
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,711
and I met Clementine.

88
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:04,483
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:08,148
We'll start with
your most recent memories,

90
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:11,336
and work backwards from there.

91
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,092
There's an emotional core
to each of our memories...

92
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:19,252
and when you eradicate that core,
it starts its degradation process.

93
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:21,139
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

94
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:23,004
all the memories we've targeted...

95
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:25,155
will have withered and disappeared.

96
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:27,812
As in a dream upon waking.

97
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,595
Is there any risk of brain damage?

98
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:35,437
Technically speaking,
the procedure is brain damage.

99
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:39,273
But it's on a par
with a night of heavy drinking.

100
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,236
Nothing you'll miss.

101
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,033
Comfortable?

102
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:49,521
What we're doing here is
actually creating a map of your brain.

103
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,031
Let's get started.

104
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:52,526
If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,

105
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,817
we have some work to do.

106
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:58,958
I want you to react to these objects.

107
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:03,416
There's a good story behind that

108
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,015
I'll get a much better
emotional read-out...

109
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:11,398
if you refrain from any sort
of verbal description of the items.

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,278
Just please try to focus
on the memories.

111
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,053
Sorry.

112
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:19,396
Healthy activity up there again.

113
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:20,483
Healthy read-outs.

114
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:21,992
Very good.

115
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,786
Here's another object.

116
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,185
Next item.

117
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,435
Po-ta-to head.

118
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,147
Next item.

119
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:37,111
Just focus on the memories.

120
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:42,765
Patrick, do me a favor, will you?

121
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:46,198
Can you check the voltage regulator?

122
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,504
Voltage looks fine.

123
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:49,728
Really?

124
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:52,652
I'm not wiping as clean as
I like here.

125
00:06:56,985 --> 00:07:00,045
Technically,
the procedure is brain damage.

126
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:03,260
But it's on a par
with a night of heavy drinking.

127
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:06,517
Check the connections, please.

128
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:09,745
There you are.

129
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,556
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

130
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,675
Why am I standing here and...

131
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,839
Oh, my God, deja vu.

132
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:29,402
This is so...
We should get started.

133
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:30,952
If we want to get the procedure...

134
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,381
underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

135
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:35,955
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

136
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,924
I suppose so.

137
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,005
This is what it would look like.

138
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:46,467
Very good.

139
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:49,483
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

140
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,026
Then you won't be confused later

141
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:53,853
by their unexplainable presence
in your home.

142
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:57,476
Patrick?

143
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,018
Patrick?

144
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,216
Why are there so many wires?

145
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:07,116
Because we have a lot of equipment.

146
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,130
Does that help?

147
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:11,641
Are you sure
you set that thing up properly?

148
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:17,138
I don't know if I like this.

149
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:21,682
Ah, yourjournal.

150
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,343
That'll be invaluable.

151
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:27,649
I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.

152
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,558
Her name's Clementine
and she's amazing.

153
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:33,309
Whoa, Jesus!
What? What?

154
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:37,593
Careful Step back!

155
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:40,043
It's fine.

156
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,078
Let's not roach the guy.

157
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,351
Alright. We got that one.

158
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,521
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

159
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,645
It's an apartment, Patrick

160
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,447
Patrick

161
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:56,166
Well, not a dump, but sort of plain.

162
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:57,891
Uninspired.

163
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:00,895
And there's sort of a stale smell.

164
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:04,956
Patrick Can we just get through this?

165
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:08,025
We've got a long night ahead of us.

166
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:16,103
This is the last time I saw you.

167
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,159
It's three o'clock

168
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:38,141
I kind of wrecked your car.

169
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:39,992
Driving drunk

170
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:41,683
It's pathetic.

171
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,772
I was a little tipsy.

172
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:46,291
Don't call me pathetic!

173
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,980
It is pathetic.

174
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,594
It's irresponsible.

175
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,286
You could have killed somebody.

176
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,660
Maybe you did kill somebody.

177
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:54,791
Should we turn on the news and see?

178
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:57,915
Should I check the grill to see
if there's children or small animals?

179
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,875
It's just a fucking dent.

180
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:01,355
You're like an old lady or something.

181
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:03,318
What are you like?

182
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:06,277
A wino?

183
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:07,394
Jesus.

184
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,735
Are you from the 50's or something?

185
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,566
A wino?

186
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,602
Face it.

187
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:18,102
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you...

188
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:22,763
and in your little, wormy brain,
you're trying to figure out...

189
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:25,423
Did she fuck someone tonight?

190
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,771
See, Clem, I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

191
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:33,774
Isn't that how
you get people to like you?

192
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,172
I'm sorry, okay?

193
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,106
I didn't mean it.

194
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:56,763
Your keys.

195
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,342
I won't need them anymore.

196
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:03,674
I was just angry or annoyed
or something.

197
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:12,092
Clem.

198
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:16,054
Got it.

199
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:20,115
Mary's coming over tonight.

200
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,383
Just thought you'd want to know.

201
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,884
I like when Mary comes to visit.

202
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:26,386
I just don't think she likes me.

203
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,178
She likes you okay.

204
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,578
So maybe I should invite
my girlfriend over.

205
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,703
I have a girlfriend now.

206
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:34,578
Do whatever you want.

207
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,558
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

208
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,707
We have to focus here.

209
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:51,859
The thing is,
my situation is a little weird.

210
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,854
My girlfriend situation.

211
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,629
I'm sure it is.

212
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,100
Clem, let me drive you home.

213
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:27,806
Get out of my face, faggot!

214
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,403
Look at it out here!

215
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:32,126
It's all falling apart!

216
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,749
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

217
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,063
You did it to me first!

218
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,412
I can't believe you did this to me!

219
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,048
Goddamnit!

220
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:43,286
Clem. Did you hear me?

221
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,436
By morning you'll be gone!

222
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:50,287
The perfect ending
to this piece of shit story!

223
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:58,987
Is there something wrong with
a girl being attracted to me?

224
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:01,739
No. I think it's funny.

225
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,852
Who do you think's better- looking,
me or this guy?

226
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,084
Patrick, let's focus.

227
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,640
Remember that girl we did last week?

228
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:12,976
The one with the potatoes?

229
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,156
That girl

230
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:19,585
That's this guy's girlfriend.

231
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:23,360
Was. We took care of that.

232
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,466
I kind of fell in love
with her that night.

233
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,366
What?

234
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,303
You little fucker.

235
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:32,388
What?

236
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:34,831
She was unconscious.

237
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:41,445
She was beautiful, and I stole
a pair of her panties, too.

238
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:45,535
Jesus!

239
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:47,845
They were clean.

240
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,314
I don't want to hear this shit.

241
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:52,317
They were clean.

242
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,402
Stop. We've got work to do.

243
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,287
Okay. Fine.

244
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:16,189
There's more.

245
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:22,398
After we did her,
I kind of asked her out.

246
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:29,408
Jesus.

247
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,472
Do you know how unethical?

248
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:39,714
It's not really that bad.

249
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:41,483
Get that look off your face.

250
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,188
What's wrong?

251
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:45,803
You stole a girl' s panties.

252
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:02,290
There's someone here...
he stole your underwear.

253
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:05,064
I don't see anyone.

254
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,784
Joel, where are my boots?

255
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,206
I'm crawling out of my skin!

256
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:50,606
I should have left you
at the flea market.

257
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:05,626
Want to go?

258
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,840
I want to have a baby.

259
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:11,973
Let's talk about it later.

260
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:15,060
No. I want to have a baby.

261
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:17,992
I don't think we're ready.

262
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:21,088
You're not ready.

263
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:24,842
Do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

264
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:27,440
What?

265
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:30,501
I don't want to talk about it here.

266
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:31,633
I can't hear you.

267
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:33,372
I can never understand
what you're saying!

268
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,749
I said
I don't want to talk about this!

269
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:37,422
We're fucking gonna talk about it!

270
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:41,321
You can't just say you don't
want to talk about it!

271
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,148
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,720
I'd make a fucking good mother!

273
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,252
I love children.

274
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,819
I'm creative and I'm smart!

275
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,299
It's you, Joel.

276
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,327
It's you who can't commit to anything.

277
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,882
It's going! It's going.
You're lucky I'm interested in you.

278
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:56,091
I don't even know why I am.

279
00:16:56,272 --> 00:16:58,263
Maybe I should end it right here!
It's over.

280
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:02,333
Leave you at the flea market,
with the costume jewelry!

281
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,700
Maybe you can find a nice
antique rocking chair to die in!

282
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:16,203
All the pain. Confusion...
Hi, Patrick

283
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:17,246
How's it going, Mary?

284
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:19,154
It's freezing outside.

285
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:20,238
Find us okay?

286
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:21,942
Yeah.

287
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:27,767
Hot.

288
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,758
Poor guy.

289
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:35,560
Do you have anything real to drink?

290
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:38,753
We haven't checked yet.

291
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:40,555
Patrick?

292
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:42,816
Let me do the honors.

293
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:46,068
Mary hates me.

294
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,607
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

295
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:51,333
Maybe if you stopped stealing
their panties.

296
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:03,448
You didn't want any, did you, Patrick?

297
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:05,598
No. That's okay.

298
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,788
Wait.

299
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:08,266
Blessed are the forgetful,

300
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:11,229
for they get the better even
of their blunders.

301
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:23,644
That's Nietzsche.

302
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,348
Beyond Good and Evil.

303
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:27,413
I found it in my Bartlett's.

304
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,332
What's your Bartlett's?

305
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:31,595
It's a quote book

306
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,835
It's a book of quotations.

307
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,199
I think Howard
will be in Bartlett's one day.

308
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:36,961
Definitely.

309
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,033
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

310
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,854
Can you wake him up?

311
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:46,129
You can't wake him up.

312
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,620
You don't tell me things.

313
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,292
I'm an open book

314
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:03,425
I tell you everything.

315
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:06,773
Every damn embarrassing thing.

316
00:19:09,385 --> 00:19:11,410
You don't trust me.

317
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:15,349
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

318
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:19,464
I don't do that.

319
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,053
I want to know you.

320
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:29,082
I don't constantly talk.

321
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:31,152
Jesus.

322
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:35,507
People have to share things.

323
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,771
That's what intimacy is.

324
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:41,397
I'm really pissed that
you said that to me!

325
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:43,002
Sorry.

326
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:47,538
My life just really
isn't that interesting.

327
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:50,734
I want to read those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.

328
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:55,832
What do you write if you don't have
any thoughts or passions or love?

329
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:07,387
November 19th, Two thousand three.

330
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:10,928
Dinner at Kang's again.

331
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:15,692
Are we like those poor couples

332
00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:18,377
you feel... sorry for in restaurants?

333
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,853
Are we the dining dead?

334
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,274
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

335
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,260
I like that.

336
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:35,820
How's the chicken?

337
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:38,321
Good.

338
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,398
More?

339
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,633
No, thank you.

340
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:47,761
She's going to be drunk
and stupid now.

341
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:51,677
Would you do me a favor
and clean the goddamn hair...

342
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,509
off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

343
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:57,025
Yeah, it's gross.

344
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,974
I think it's just...

345
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:02,035
Repulsive.

346
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:04,012
It's repulsive.

347
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:11,702
Can we get through this?

348
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:13,427
Patrick?

349
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,131
Hey, Tangerine.

350
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,345
Patrick, it's you.

351
00:21:19,437 --> 00:21:21,905
I'm so miserable right now.

352
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:23,450
What's wrong?

353
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:24,341
I don't know.

354
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,076
I'm just confused about everything.

355
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:32,204
What are you confused about?

356
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:34,817
Everything's fine.

357
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,857
Do you love me?

358
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,280
Of course I do.

359
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:45,309
Where's the self -help section?

360
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:47,715
Do you think I'm ugly?

361
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,899
No. You're beautiful.

362
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:51,090
Maybe I should come over.

363
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:56,265
Oh no. I'm a mess.

364
00:21:56,977 --> 00:21:59,036
Just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

365
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,605
Okay.

366
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:02,275
Can I leave for a while?

367
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:03,498
My girlfriend's really upset.

368
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:07,822
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's -

369
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:10,220
Let him go. I'll help.

370
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:12,753
How hard can it be?

371
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:13,743
She hates me.

372
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:14,853
She wants me to go.

373
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:16,366
Go.

374
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:17,645
Alright.

375
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:19,308
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

376
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:20,992
You like?

377
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:26,931
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

378
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:27,609
I like it.

379
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:30,566
You look like a tangerine.

380
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,529
Clemen-teen the tangerine.

381
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,880
Juicy and seedless.

382
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:37,346
I like that.

383
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,009
I like tangerines.

384
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,016
Can you see me doing ducks?

385
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:45,343
Tangerine...

386
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:47,606
How does he know to call you that?

387
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,002
How did who know?

388
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
Oh my God. Clem?

389
00:22:51,844 --> 00:22:53,209
That's what they called themselves.

390
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:55,877
The Clash,
the only band that mattered.

391
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,149
And they called themselves
that for a reason.

392
00:22:58,385 --> 00:22:59,249
It's amazing, isn't it?

393
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:00,361
Like Social Justice.

394
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,031
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

395
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:04,714
What Howard gives to the world.

396
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:07,835
Yeah.

397
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:10,287
To let people begin again.

398
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:13,359
It's beautiful.

399
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:17,922
You look at a baby, and it's
so pure and so free and so...

400
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:19,788
clean and...

401
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,858
Adults are this mess
of sadness and...

402
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,140
phobias.

403
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,829
And Howard just makes it all go away.

404
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:43,385
Baby, what's going on?

405
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:45,240
I don't know.

406
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:49,121
I'm lost, I'm scared,
I feel like I'm disappearing.

407
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:51,017
My skin's coming off!

408
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,030
I'm getting old!

409
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,505
Nothing makes any sense to me!

410
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:54,728
You're not getting old.

411
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:56,411
Nothing makes any sense.

412
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:58,184
Nothing makes any sense.

413
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,061
Tangerine...

414
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,981
It's okay.

415
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,415
Let's go out dancing.

416
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,418
You want to go out to Montauk with me?

417
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:10,264
Montauk?

418
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:12,736
Yeah. No!
Come up to Boston with me.

419
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,674
Sure.
We can go next weekend.

420
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:18,328
No. I have to go now.

421
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:20,878
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

422
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,227
Hi, it's Joel.

423
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:32,741
Leave me a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.

424
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:36,726
Pick up.

425
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,115
Hello? What's up?

426
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,525
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

427
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:48,388
Can you handle things tonight alone?

428
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:50,095
I'm really sorry.

429
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,369
Don't worry.
I've got it under control.

430
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:54,699
He's on auto-pilot now anyway.

431
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:56,461
Thanks. I owe you big-time.

432
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:58,337
I've got to go.

433
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:14,337
Look! You and me
on the Charles River.

434
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:16,118
I could die right now.

435
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:17,767
I'm just happy.

436
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,959
I've never felt that before.

437
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,347
I'm exactly where I want...

438
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:24,289
I'm so excited!

439
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,909
I'm excited, too.

440
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,407
Cool.

441
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,120
I got you this thing.

442
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,594
Happy early Valentine's Day.

443
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,018
Wow. What is it?

444
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,579
I don't know. Open it up.

445
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:54,373
It's gorgeous.

446
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,059
You like it?

447
00:25:55,231 --> 00:25:57,563
It's just my taste, really.

448
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,071
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me jewelry I liked.

449
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:04,045
Thank you.

450
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:14,380
Joely?

451
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,839
Yeah, Tangerine?

452
00:26:18,193 --> 00:26:19,888
Am I ugly?

453
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,323
When I was a kid I thought I was.

454
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:28,185
Can't believe I'm crying already.

455
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:31,243
Sometimes
I think people don't understand

456
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:33,850
how lonely it is to be a kid.

457
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:37,121
Like you don't matter.

458
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:40,458
So, I'm eight...

459
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:44,869
and I have these toys, these dolls.

460
00:26:45,192 --> 00:26:50,027
My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.

461
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:53,938
And I keep yelling at her
You can't be ugly!

462
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,865
Be pretty!

463
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,898
It's weird.

464
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,568
Like if I can transform her...

465
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,013
I would magically change, too.

466
00:27:09,477 --> 00:27:10,341
You're pretty.

467
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:14,753
Joely. Don't ever leave me.

468
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:18,430
You're pretty.

469
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:22,098
Please let me keep this memory.

470
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:24,250
Just this one.

471
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:26,440
I want to hold your hand. Come on.

472
00:27:30,804 --> 00:27:32,032
Stop it!
