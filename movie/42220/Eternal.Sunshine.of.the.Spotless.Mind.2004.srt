1
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,069
"真是多谢!"

2
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:35,874
"前往蒙塔克的火车在B站台"
"Montauk train on track B."

3
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:40,281
2004年情人节  偶然的想法
Random thoughts for Valentine's Day, 2004.

4
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,617
今天是贺卡公司发明的节日
Today is a holiday invented by greeting card companies

5
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,615
"最后一次播报"
Last call

6
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:49,173
好让人们感觉像废物
to make people feel like crap.

7
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,840
我今天没去上班
I ditched work today.

8
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:57,276
而是坐上了去蒙塔克的火车
Took a train out to Montauk.

9
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:00,044
"请到B站台搭乘前往蒙塔克的火车"
"Montauk train boarding on track B."

10
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:02,712
我不知道原因
I don 't know why.

11
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,949
我不是一个冲动的人
Aah! I'm not an impulsive person.

12
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:17,319
我想只是今早醒来有些茫然失措
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.

13
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:19,718
我得把车送去修理
I gotta get my car fixed.

14
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:21,726
你好  辛迪
Hi. Cindy?

15
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:24,224
我是乔尔  乔尔!
It's Joel. Joel!

16
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:28,250
听着  我今天感觉不舒服
Listen, I don't feel very well today.

17
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,259
不  我想是食物中毒
No, food poisoning, I think.

18
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,815
这海滩实在是冷死人
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

19
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:36,454
二月份的蒙塔克  真是不错  乔尔
Montauk in February Brilliant,Joel.

20
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,160
被撕掉的页
Page is ripped out.

21
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,748
不记得自己撕过
Don't remember doing that.

22
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:48,854
这好像是我两年来的头一次记录
It appears this is my first entry in two years.

23
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,655
不要过度赞美细沙
Sand is overrated.

24
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:02,851
它们不过是细小的岩石
It's just tiny, little rocks.

25
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:15,151
希望我能结识新的伴侣
If only, I could meet someone new.

26
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:19,098
但我想这样的机会很小
I guess my chances of that happening are some what diminished,

27
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,765
我不敢和眼前这陌生女人 做目光的接触
seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.

28
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:28,031
也许我该和内奥米重修旧好
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.

29
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:30,798
她很美丽  美丽就是好
She was nice. Nice is good.

30
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:35,364
她爱过我
She loved me.

31
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:15,441
为什么我总是爱上每个
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see

32
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:18,379
对我稍加注意的女人?
who shows me the least bit of attention?

33
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,412
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

34
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:06,149
-我只是问好  -嗨  你好
-I just said hi. - Hi. Hello. Hi.

35
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,876
我可以坐近些吗?
Okay if I sit closer?

36
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:12,953
你到哪儿去?
How far are you going?

37
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,282
嗯  洛克威尔中心
Uh, Rockville Center.

38
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:17,649
不会吧!  我也是!
Get out! Me too!

39
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,657
-真的?  -真巧
Really? What are the odds?

40
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:24,873
我认识你吗?
Do I know you?

41
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,619
你是不是在巴恩斯・洛贝尔店买过书?
Do you ever shop at Barnes & Noble?

42
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,818
-是的  -那就对了!
Sure. Sure. That's it!

43
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:34,255
-什么?  -我以前见过你
Yeah? I've seen you, man!

44
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:38,482
我在那里作售书员已经五年了
Book slave there for, like, five years now.

45
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:41,919
-啊  我想我可能记得你  -天  是五年吗?
Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you. Jesus! Is it five years?

46
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:44,087
可能是头发的缘故
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,285
-可能什么?  -发型改变了很多
What might? It changes a lot.

48
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:49,652
我改变了发型的颜色  那就是你没认出我来的原因
The color. That's why you might not recognize me.

49
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:53,390
-这发型颜色叫"蓝色废墟"  -很对
It's called Blue Ruin, the color. Right. Yeah.

50
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,787
-很时髦的名字  对吧?  -我喜欢
Snappy name, huh? I like it.

51
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:01,423
这公司所做出的全色系的发型  名字都很时髦
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.

52
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:05,950
红色威胁、黄色狂热、绿色革命
Red-- Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

53
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,957
一定有专门职位来命名这些发型
That'd be a job coming up with those names.

54
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:11,964
会有那样的工作吗?
You think there could possibly be a job like that?

55
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:15,551
我是说 总共才有多少种发型颜色呢? 也许十五种吧
I mean how many hair colors could there be? Fifty, maybe.

56
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:17,649
有人在做这工作
Someone's got that job.

57
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:22,766
我能想出来的-橙色特工!
Agent Orange! I came up with that one.

58
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:25,733
我用发型颜色来表明我的个性
I apply my personality in a paste.

59
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,731
噢  我很怀疑
Oh, I doubt that very much.

60
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,289
因为你不认识我  那么
Well, you don't know me, so

61
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:33,487
你并不了解我  对吧?
you don't know, do you?

62
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:39,731
对不起  我只是想尽量显得友好些
Sorry. I was just-- I'm trying to be nice.

63
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,558
好的  我明白了
Yeah. I got it.

64
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:06,039
-顺便提一下  我叫克莱门汀  -我叫乔尔
My name's Clementine, by the way. I'm Joel.

65
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,437
你好  乔尔
Hi,Joel. Hey.

66
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:11,025
不准取笑我的名字
No jokes about my name.

67
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:14,402
不  你不会那么做的  你想尽量友好些
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that. You're trying to be nice.

68
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,399
我不知怎样取笑你的名字
I don't know any jokes about your name.

69
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,637
腰浆果狗(卡通片名)
Huckleberry Hound.

70
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,265
我不知道那是什么
I don't know what that means.

71
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:26,472
你不知道腰浆果狗?  你白痴么?
Huckleberry Hound? What are you nuts?

72
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,471
有人曾这样暗示过
It's been suggested.

73
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,637
我亲爱的 我亲爱的克莱门汀
Oh my darling, oh my darling, Oh my darling Clementine

74
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:34,805
你已永远离去
You were lost and gone forever

75
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,403
多么抱歉  克莱门汀
Dreadful sorry Clementine

76
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,412
知道了吗?
No?

77
00:07:38,482 --> 00:07:42,408
对不起  但那真是个美丽的名字
I'm sorry. Just-- It's a pretty name, though. It really is nice.

78
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:44,467
它的意思是  "仁慈"
It's, uh-- It means "merciful."

79
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,476
对吗 仁慈?
Right? Clemency?

80
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:48,743
虽然看上去不像
Although it hardly fits.

81
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:51,112
但说真的  我是一个报复心极强的小贱货
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

82
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:53,609
我不会那样想
Gee, I wouldn't think that aboutyou.

83
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,877
-为什么?  -我不知道
Why wouldn't you think that about me? I don't know.

84
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:59,174
我只是
I just--

85
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,583
我不知道  我只是
I don't know. I just, uh--

86
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,582
你看上去是好人  那
You seem nice, so--

87
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:05,669
噢  现在我成好人啦?
Oh, now I'm nice?

88
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:08,907
上帝!  难道你不会用别的形容词汇吗?
Oh, God. Don't you know any other adjectives?

89
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,915
我不需要好
I don't need "nice."

90
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:14,972
我不想对别人好  也不想别人对我好
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.

91
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,808
乔尔?
Joel?

92
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,145
你的名字是乔尔吧?
It's Joel, right?

93
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:25,653
是的
Yes.

94
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:28,150
对不起  冲你大喊大叫
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

95
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,708
我今天有些不开心
I'm a little out of sorts today.

96
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:42,289
我得不好意思的承认
My embarrassing admission is,

97
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:45,286
我真的喜欢你对我好
I really like that you're nice right now.

98
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:50,182
我的意思是 我不知道下一时刻自己会喜欢什么
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like,

99
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,251
但是现在
but right now

100
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,378
我很高兴你对我好
I'm glad you are.

101
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:06,748
我有很多事情  我也许该
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should

102
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,915
-我正在写作  -对不起
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay. I-I'm writing, and--

103
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,083
-不 不用  -没什么
No, no. I just-- Sure. No. That's okay.

104
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:15,751
我只是得 你知道 这是 好吧
I just have-- You know, this is-- Okay.

105
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:18,229
保重
- Take care, then.

106
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,287
老天!
Jesus!

107
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:37,523
我可以送你一程 如果你需要的话
Hi. I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.

108
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,531
天很冷
It's cold.

109
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,499
好 好的
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah?

110
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:43,468
都结霜了
It is frosty.

111
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:46,325
-你不是在跟踪我吧?  -我没有
You're not a stalker or anything, right? I'm not a stalker.

112
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:48,494
是你先和我说话的  还记得吗?
You're the one that talked to me. Remember?

113
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:50,831
那是跟踪守则中最老土的伎俩
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.

114
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,030
真的吗?  有这本书?
Really? There's a stalker book?

115
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:57,696
好的  我会读读看
I gotta read that one.

116
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:07,199
看 我对刚才的疯狂表现感到抱歉  我并不是这样
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

117
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:10,665
没什么  我没想过你是
Oh, it's okay. I didn't think you were.

118
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,368
你想喝一杯吗?
Did you wanna have a drink?

119
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:21,626
我有很多种酒  我可以
I have lots of drinks, and I could

120
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,633
算了
Never mind.

121
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:28,071
-对不起 那真傻  真难为情  -不 不 不
Sorry. That was stupid. I'm embarrassed now. No, no, no, no.

122
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,129
晚安  乔尔
Good night,Joel.

123
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:51,701
两杯蓝色废墟
Two Blue Ruins.

124
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,509
谢谢
Thank you.

125
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,507
喝光它  小子
Drink up, young man.

126
00:10:56,577 --> 00:10:59,374
这样我勾引你就不会惹你反感了
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

127
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:04,610
我只是开玩笑!
I'm just kidding!

128
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,669
来吧
Come on.

129
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,602
你有点内向  是吧?
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren'tyou?

130
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:16,610
对不起
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,166
那只是  我的生活很无趣
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.

132
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,844
我去上班  我下班回家
I go to work, I come home.

133
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,410
我不知道有什么好说的
Don't know what to say.

134
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,419
你应看看我的日记
You should read myjournal.

135
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:34,975
我的意思是  我的生活全是 空白
I mean, it's just blank.

136
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:38,282
真的?  那让你觉得悲哀或忧虑吗?
Really? Does that make you sad oranxious?

137
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:41,680
我是说  想到没有好好生活我就觉得忧虑
I mean, I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest,

138
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,687
可以利用各种可能性
taking advantage of every possibility,

139
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:47,685
来确保我没有浪费  我所拥有的每一秒
making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

140
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,242
-我想过  -是吗?
I think about that. Yeah?

141
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:56,617
你真是好人
You're really nice.

142
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:59,514
上帝  我一直忍不住这样说
Ohh! God, I have to stop saying that.

143
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,721
我想嫁给你
I'm gonna marry you.

144
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,719
我知道这一点
I know it.

145
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:07,948
嗯 好的
Um okay.

146
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:17,619
乔尔  你哪天应陪我去查尔斯河看看
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.

147
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,628
它在每年二月这时都会结冰
It gets frozen this time of year.

148
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,845
-听起来很恐怖  -对
That sounds scary. Exactly.

00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,322
真对不起
I apologize.

328
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:45,636
这是开玩笑  对吗?  这是克莱门汀她
This is a hoax, right? I mean, this is Clem--

329
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,534
-我向你保证  -不是的
I am sure you. No.

330
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:56,697
这算什么
There's no such thing as this.

331
00:26:58,206 --> 00:27:01,404
瞧  巴瑞斯先生  客户档案是保密的
Look, our files are confidential, Mr.Barish,

332
00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:03,941
我不能把它们给你看
so I can't show you evidence.

333
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:09,736
这样说吧  克罗斯基活得很不快乐
Suffice it to say that Miss, Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

334
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,865
她想要新的生活
and she wanted to move on.

335
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:13,872
我们提供了可行性
We provide that possibility.

336
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:18,000
克罗斯基活得很不快乐  她想要新的生活
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.

337
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,597
我们提供了可行性
We provide that possibility."

338
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:22,606
那是什么鬼话?
What the hell is that?

339
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,603
我是她遇到过的最好的男人
Nicest guy she everwent out with.

340
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:30,109
天  罗布!  别敲了!
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

341
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,107
没什么
It's okay. It's all right.

342
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:34,876
卡丽  我正在作鸟屋
Carrie, I am making a bird house.

343
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:40,641
我怎么说呢?  乔尔  你了解克莱门汀  她就是这样
What can Isay, Joel? You know Clementine. She's like that.

344
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:42,509
做事冲动
She's impulsive.

345
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:46,136
她一时兴起就想将你彻底忘记
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.

346
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,981
一时兴起?
A lark.

347
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:55,478
为什么?  为什么?  为什么你要那样做?
Why? Why? Why? Why did you do that?

348
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,814
等等  等等!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

349
00:28:00,884 --> 00:28:03,811
对不起  医生  他硬闯进来
I'm sorry, Doctor. He just barged right in here.

350
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:05,380
-好吧  我想清除我的记忆
Okay. I want it done.

351
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,949
-我告诉他在情人节前我们是最忙的
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.

352
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:10,315
-没事的  玛丽  -但有人还等着
that's okay, Mary. -But there are people waiting.

353
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:13,313
巴瑞斯先生  如果你愿意进来
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to come inside.

354
00:28:13,383 --> 00:28:16,940
-玛丽  你能送走吴女士吗?  -当然可以
And Mary, if you could take care of Mrs Woo. Yes, of course.

355
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,682
我们要你做的头一件事  巴瑞斯先生
the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

356
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,680
就是回家
is to go home.

357
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:34,186
寻找所有与克莱门汀有关的事物
and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.

358
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,484
所有的
Anything.

359
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:41,410
我们会用这些事物在你的大脑里
And we'll use these items to

360
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,857
建立一个与克莱门汀有关的映象
create a map of Clementine in your brain.

361
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:49,982
所以我们需要相片、衣物、礼品
So we'll need, photos, clothing, gifts,

362
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:55,008
像她送给你的书  你们俩一起购买的CD
books she may have bought you CDs, you may have bought together,

363
00:28:55,088 --> 00:28:57,716
日记
journal entries.

364
00:28:57,786 --> 00:28:59,554
我们想清空你的家
We want to empty your home.

365
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:03,951
我们想从你生命中清除克莱门汀
We want to empty your life of Clementine.

366
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:06,269
在那个映象被建立后
And after the mapping is done,

367
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:08,517
技术员今晚会到你家作记忆消除术
our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.

368
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:11,924
这样  你第二天清晨醒来时
That way, when you awake in the morning,

369
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:16,430
你发现自己躺在床上  就像什么也没发生过一样
you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened.

370
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,978
一个全新的生活等待着你
a new life waiting you.

371
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:25,453
别作白日梦  伙计!
Wake up, buddy!

372
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,428
对不起  索贝尔夫人
No, I'm sorry. Mrs.Sobel.

373
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:35,655
你不能一个月做三次记忆消除术
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.

374
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:40,321
这是我们的制度  你好吗  巴瑞斯先生?
Well, it's just not our policy. How are you today, Mr. Barish?

375
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,058
你好  我还在线
Hello. I'm right here.

376
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:46,226
我知道这很紧急  我们会尽力把你
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can

377
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:48,324
安排到三月份头一个
We can fit you in on the first of March.

378
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:51,831
也许你该跟医生说说
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, and he--

379
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:54,030
好吧  我们就这样约定了
All right, so let's make an appointment.

380
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,157
你星期几来?
What day would you like to come in this week?

381
00:29:56,237 --> 00:29:59,665
-巴瑞斯先生  -医生今下午真的很忙
Mr. Barish. he's really busy this afternoon.

382
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:03,691
也许明天十二点一刻比较好
Maybe tomorrow would be better. Around 12:15? Can you do that?

383
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:07,638
因为二月有情人节  所以我们忙得够呛
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.

384
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:16,831
这是斯坦・范恩
This is Stan Fink,

385
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:19,498
我们最好的技术人员之一
one of ourmost experienced andskilled technicians.

386
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:24,064
他今晚为你做消除术
He'll be handling your case tonight.

387
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:26,572
很高兴认识你  巴瑞斯先生
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

388
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:28,571
我叫乔尔・巴瑞斯
My name is Joel Barish,

389
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:33,197
我来这儿消除对克莱门汀・克罗斯基的记忆
and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.

390
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:38,293
很好  现在告诉我关于克莱门汀的事
Very good. Now tell me about Clementine.

391
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:40,900
嗯 我
Uh, I was

392
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,767
本来和另一个女人一起生活  她叫内奥米
Living with this woman, Naomi,

393
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:47,405
几年前
uh, a couple years ago,

394
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:50,093
我的朋友罗布和卡丽请我们去一个海滩聚会
and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach.

395
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:52,700
我不喜欢聚会
I don't like parties.

396
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,008
内奥米不能去  但我去了
Naomi couldn't go, but I went

397
00:30:56,078 --> 00:30:59,235
而且遇到了克莱门汀
and I met Clementine.

398
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,303
对不起
I 'm sorry.

399
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:05,310
让我们从你最近的回忆开始
Let's start with your most recent memories

400
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,966
然后慢慢向以前删除
and work back wards from there, more or less.

401
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:10,975
我们的每一段记忆中
There's an emotional core

402
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:12,984
都会有一个感情核心
to each of our memories,

403
00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:16,810
当这个核心被清除掉时  相应的记忆会缓慢消失
and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.

404
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,309
明早你醒来时
By the time you wake up in the morning,

405
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,105
相应的记忆就会消失无踪
all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared,

406
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:25,203
就像快醒时做的梦一样
as in a dream upon waking.

407
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:28,581
有损伤大脑的危险吗?
Is there any risk of brain damage?

408
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:31,638
从技术角度讲
Well, uh, technically speaking,

409
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:33,646
这过程本身就是对大脑的伤害
the procedure is brain damage,

410
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:36,543
但只相当于一场宿醉
but it's on a parwith a night of heavy drinking.

411
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:38,552
你不会有事的
Nothing you'll miss.

412
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:43,018
舒服吗?
Comfortable?

413
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:46,716
巴瑞斯先生  我们现在做的是生成你的脑部图
What we're doing here Mr. Barish is actually creating a map of your brain.

414
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:49,113
好  我们开始吧
Okay, let's getstarted.

415
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:52,911
如果你想今晚就做的话  我们有些准备工作要做
If we want to get this procedure under way tonight. We have some work to do.

416
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:56,817
巴瑞斯先生  我要你对这些物体作出反应
I want you to react to these objects Mr. Barish, if you will.

417
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,923
这里面有一个好故事.
There's a good story behind this one.

418
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:04,920
巴瑞斯先生  我会得到比较准确的情感读数
Actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout.

419
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,887
如果你只在脑海里描述
If you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.

420
00:32:08,957 --> 00:32:10,885
所以把集中精力来回忆
Just try to focus on the memories.

421
00:32:10,955 --> 00:32:13,513
-对不起  -没什么
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

422
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:19,728
健康活性集中在那儿 健康读数很好
Healthy activity up there again. Healthy readouts Very good.

423
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:23,055
另一件物体
-Here's another object. -That's so.

424
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,713
下一件
Next item. Okay.

425
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,220
"土豆头"
Potato head.

426
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,557
下一件
-Next item. Okay. -

427
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:37,494
集中精力去回忆  帕特里克  帮帮我
Just focus on the memories. Patrick, do me a fiavor.

428
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:40,890
-帕特里克  帮帮我好吗?  -好的
Patrick, do me a fiavor, will you? Yeah.

429
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,827
你能检查下稳压器吗?
Can you check the voltage regulator? What do we got there?

430
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:46,825
-电压看来合适  -真的吗?
-voltage looks fine. Really?

431
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:50,882
我这里不太清楚
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.

432
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,955
技术上讲  这个过程就是大脑损伤
Well, technically, the procedure is brain damage.

433
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:03,491
请检查一下电路连接
Check the connections, please.

434
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,928
你在这里
Oh, there you are.

435
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:17,359
为什么我?  我不能理解我所看到的
Why am I? I don't understand what I'm looking at.

436
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,228
为什么我站在这儿而
Why am I standing here and--

437
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:23,135
天  幻觉记忆!
Oh, my God. Dejavu.

438
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:25,293
一切似曾相识!  这太
Dejavu. This is so--

439
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:28,301
好  那让我们开始吧  如果我们想今晚就做的话
All right, we should get started. If we're gonna get the procedure.

440
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:31,298
那我们现在有些准备工作要做
under way tonight, we have some work to do.

441
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:33,897
我已经进入自己的回忆  对吧?
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

快完成了
We're almost done now.

457
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,267
日记的价值无法衡量

她叫克莱门汀  她很漂亮

461
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:35,675
放松些!
Just take it easy.

462
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:37,573

Well, not a dump then but sorta plain. Uninspired.

468
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:57,887
还有一股霉臭味
And there's sort of a stale smell.

469
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:02,513
帕特里克 我们能不能不管这些?
Patrick, can we just please get through this?

470
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:06,209
-我们还要过漫长的一夜 -好的

也许我们该在这里分手了  约尔!
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!

586
00:42:56,897 --> 00:42:58,576
-把你和愚蠢的服装珠宝一起甩在跳蚤市场
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!

587
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,264
-清除了  这段回忆是垃圾
-It's done. This is crap.

588
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:02,572
-也许你能找把古董摇椅好去死在上面
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!

589
00:43:02,572 --> 00:43:04,821
-所有的这些痛苦和迷惑
-All the pain, confusion

590
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:14,422
-你好  帕特里克  -你好  玛丽  还好吗?
-Hi, Patrick. -Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

591
00:43:14,502 --> 00:43:17,430
-你好  -天真冷
Hey, you. Oh, it's freezing outside.

592
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:19,328
-我们做得还不错吧?  -是的
Find us okay? Yeah.

593
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:25,193
-嗯  -真亲热!
Mmm. Hot!

594
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,330
可怜的家伙
Poor guy.

595
00:43:31,198 --> 00:43:33,427
有真正的饮料喝吗?
Don't you have anything real to drink?

596
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:36,434
我们真的还未检查过
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.

597
00:43:36,504 --> 00:43:38,433
-帕特里克?
Patrick?

598
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:40,900
让我来吧
Let me do the honors.

599
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,138
玛丽讨厌我
Mary hates me.

600
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:46,865
我从不讨女人的欢心
Never really had much luck with the ladies.

601
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:48,874
也许你该停止偷她们的内裤
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.

602
00:43:48,944 --> 00:43:51,961
斯坦  斯坦
Stan. Stan.

603
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:53,470
-还有更多事  -别说了!
There's more. No!

604
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,839
-是的  -不!
Yes. No!

605
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:01,803
你不想要酒吧 帕特里克?
You didn't want any, did you, Patrick?

606
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,471
-不要  没什么  -等等
Uh, no, that's okay. Wait.

607
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:08,837
祝福那些健忘的人吧  因为他们战胜了自己过去的错误
"Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders."

608
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:23,116
尼采的《超越善恶》
That's Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil.

609
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:25,443
我从"巴特利R" 中摘来的
I found it in my Bartlett's.

610
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,442
什么是"巴特利R" ?
What's your Bartlett's?

611
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:29,410
那是一本语录  帕特里克
It's a quote book, Patrick.

612
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,378
充满各种名言警句
It's a book of quotations.

613
00:44:31,448 --> 00:44:33,936
我想医生有一天也会上"巴特利R" 的
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.

614
00:44:34,016 --> 00:44:35,944
-肯定  -医生他说的都是名言
Definitely. Howard is pure Bartlett's.

615
00:44:36,014 --> 00:44:38,383
上帝
God!

616
00:44:38,452 --> 00:44:41,011
我们这样会吵醒他吗?
Can you wake him up?

617
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,018
不会
You can't wake him up.

618
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,569
你什么都不跟我讲  乔尔
You don't tell me things, Joel.

619
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:58,046
我是一本打开的书
I'm an open book.

620
00:44:59,285 --> 00:45:01,214
我什么都告诉你
I tell you everything.

621
00:45:01,284 --> 00:45:04,510
甚至是每一件丢人的事
Every damn embarrassing thing.

622
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,206
你不信任我
You don't trust me.

623
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:12,814
不断说话并不是必要的交流方式
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.

624
00:45:15,251 --> 00:45:17,240
我没有那样做
I don't do that.

625
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:21,706
我想了解你更深
I want to know you.

626
00:45:24,894 --> 00:45:27,911
我没有不断说话!
I don't constantly talk. Jesus!

627
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,947
你必须把有些事拿出来分享  乔尔
People have to share things, Joel.

628
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:36,115
那才是亲密无间
That's what intimacy is.

629
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:39,122
你那样对我说  真让我生气
I'm really pissed thatyou said that to me.

630
00:45:39,192 --> 00:45:41,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

631
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:44,177
只是我的生活很无趣
It just really just isn't that interesting.

632
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:48,324
我想看看你一直在写的备忘录
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.

633
00:45:48,394 --> 00:45:51,552
你在里面写了什么  如果你不再有想法、激情
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions

634
00:45:51,632 --> 00:45:53,620
或爱的话?
or love?

635
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:05,489
2003年11月19日
November 19, 2003.

636
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:08,218
又在中餐馆进餐
Dinner at Kang's again.

637
00:46:10,626 --> 00:46:13,563
我们像在这餐馆中的可怜伴侣们吗?
Are we like those poor couples

638
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:16,360
你为他们感到难过
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

639
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,799
我们都是在进餐的行尸走肉吗?
Are we the dining dead?

640
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:23,555
我受不了我们那样想别人
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.

641
00:46:27,532 --> 00:46:29,969
我喜欢那样
I like that.

642
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:33,236
鸡肉好吃吗?
How's the chicken?

643
00:46:33,296 --> 00:46:35,285
好吃
Good.

644
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:39,671
-再来点?  -不要了  谢谢
More? No. No. Thank you.

645
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,137
她会喝醉然后变得愚笨
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.

646
00:46:45,206 --> 00:46:47,635
你能帮个忙
Hey, would you do me a favor

647
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:50,672
把你洗澡时留在肥皂上的  脏头发弄干净吗?
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?

648
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:52,671
-好的  -那有一点
Yeah. It's really

649
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:54,829
-恶心  -恶心
- Gross. - gross.

650
00:46:57,137 --> 00:46:59,625
-那只是  -讨厌的
-It's just -Repulsive.

651
00:46:59,705 --> 00:47:01,363
讨厌的
It's repulsive.

652
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:09,796
帕特里克  我们能不能专心完成这个?
Patrick, can we get through this?

653
00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:11,635
帕特里克
Patrick.

654
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:13,643
嗨  橘子
Hey, Tangerine.

655
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:16,831
帕特里克  是你
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

656
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:19,168
我现在很痛苦
I'm so miserable right now.

657
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:21,637
-为什么?  出了什么事?  -我不知道
-Why? What's wrong? -I don 't know.

658
00:47:21,707 --> 00:47:23,644
-什么?  -我感到非常迷惑
-Excuse me? -I'm so confused!

659
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:25,643
我能帮你找什么书吗  先生?
Can I help you fiind something, sir?

660
00:47:25,713 --> 00:47:28,701
迷惑?  你对什么感到迷惑  一切都好啊
Confused? What are you confused about? Everything's fine.

661
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:31,638

Scared of what?

663
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:40,800
-你爱我吗?  -当然爱
Do you love me? of course I do.

664
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,809
系统的自我帮助区在哪里?
Where's the self-help section?

665
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:45,347
你认为我丑吗?
Do you think I'm ugly?

666
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:47,844

斯坦  我能离开一会儿吗?  我女友真的不高兴了
Stan, can I leave for a while? My girlfriend's really upset.

672
00:48:01,214 --> 00:48:03,411
我们正在清除这可怜人的记忆中
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's--

673
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,410
让他走吧  斯坦!

让他走吧  我来帮忙

看到了吗?  这能有多难?

你看上去像个柑橘

他们的名字是有含义的

让人们能重新开始
To let people begin again.

这真美丽
It's beautiful.

699

就像看着一个婴儿  如此纯洁、自由和单纯
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.

700
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:20,028
成年人的生活真是充满悲哀
And adults are like this mess of sadness

701
00:49:20,098 --> 00:49:22,885
和恐惧
and phobias.

702
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:26,023
而医生改变了这一切
Howard just makes it all go away.

703
00:49:35,895 --> 00:49:37,883

-宝贝  怎么啦?  -我不知道  我不知道!
-Baby, what's going on? -I don't know. I don't know!

我感到迷失、害怕
I'm lost, I'm scared,

706

我感觉自己好像在消失

不  就现在  我必须得去
No, no. Now. Now. I have to go now.

716
00:50:15,672 --> 00:50:18,099
我现在必须去看结冰的查尔斯河

717
00:50:21,677 --> 00:50:24,104

我和这老女士有些问题要处理
I got into a little situation with the old lady.

723
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:47,235
你能一个人处理那里的事吗?  伙计  真抱歉
Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm really sorry, man.

724
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:50,243
别担心  伙计  一切都在我控制之中
Don't worry about it. I got it under control, man.

725

He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.

00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:13,613
"你和我在查尔斯河上 我想现在就死去 克莱"
"Look! You and me on the Charles River. I could die right now, Clem.

731
00:51:13,683 --> 00:51:17,880
"我真的很快乐 以前从未如此感受 我现在就在"
I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want"

732
00:51:19,848 --> 00:51:22,506
-我好兴奋! -我也很兴奋!
-I'm so excited. -I'm excited too!

是什么?
What is it?

737
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:42,609
我不知道  打开看看
I don't know. Open it up.

738
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:52,082
这太棒了!
It's gorgeous!

739
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:55,089
-你喜欢吗?  -是的  正合我口味
-You like it? -Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

740
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:59,515
我还从未和送我喜欢珠宝的人出去约会
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

741
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:01,573
谢谢你
Thank you.

742
00:52:08,588 --> 00:52:10,525
-走吧  -好的
-Let's go. -Okay.

743
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:13,853
-乔伊?  -什么  柑桔?
Joely? Yeah, Tangerine?

744
00:52:15,491 --> 00:52:18,010
我丑吗?
Am I ugly?

745
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,526
当我还是小孩时  我觉得自己很丑
When I was a kid, I thought I was.

746
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,684
真不敢相信我已这么多愁善感了
Can't believe I'm crying already.

747
00:52:25,763 --> 00:52:31,589
有时我认为人们不知道  小孩是多么的孤独
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely,it is to be a kid.

748
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:34,686
就像你感到自己很渺小
Like you don't matter.

749
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:38,092
所以我八岁时
So, I'm eight

750
00:52:38,162 --> 00:52:40,421
我拥有这些玩具
and I have these toys,

751
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,430
这些洋娃娃
these dolls.

752
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,225
我最喜欢一个很丑的女洋娃娃  我叫她克莱门汀
My fiavorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.

753
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:49,223
我不停的对她大喊
And I keep yelling at her:

754
00:52:49,293 --> 00:52:53,630
"你不能这么丑!  变漂亮! "
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

755
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,718
这很奇怪
It's weird.

756
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,826
就像如果我可以把她变漂亮
Like if i can transform her,

757
00:52:58,896 --> 00:53:01,523
那我也会魔术般的变漂亮
I would magically, change too.

758
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:08,198
你很漂亮!
You're pretty.

759
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,425
乔伊  永远不要离开我
Joely, don't ever leave me.

760
00:53:11,495 --> 00:53:15,522
你很漂亮  很漂亮  很漂亮
Pretty. Pretty. Pretty. Pretty.

761
00:53:15,602 --> 00:53:19,538
米R维克医生  求你让我保留这段回忆
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory..

762
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:21,537

我不想拖着你  来吧!
I don't wanna hold your hand. Come on.

764
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,301
停下
Stop it!

765
00:53:31,738 --> 00:53:34,396
我想现在就死去  克莱
I could die right now, Clem.

766
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:37,623
我真的很
I'm just

767
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:41,600
高兴

768
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:46,166
我从未如此感受
I've never felt that before.

769
00:53:49,304 --> 00:53:51,291
我现在就在
I'm just exactly

770
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,529
我一直想去的地方
where I wanna be.

771
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,596
克莱?
Clem?

772
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:07,298
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off.

773
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:09,367
我得想办法告诉他们
I'll give you a sign.

774
00:54:13,713 --> 00:54:15,702
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off!.

775
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:21,047
你听到了吗?  我无法忍受了!
Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore!

776
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:23,475
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off!.

777
00:54:23,545 --> 00:54:27,372
"你不是无事可做"
"When you ain't got nothing to do"

778
00:54:27,442 --> 00:54:29,441
"我想我会娶你"
"I think I'll marry.you"

779
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:33,277
有人听到了吗?
Is anybody there?

780
00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:42,169
-克莱门汀?  -乔尔!
Clementine? Joel?

781
00:54:42,249 --> 00:54:44,478
-克莱  -乔伊?
Clement-- Joely?

782
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:46,635
-克莱!  -乔尔?
Clem! Joel?

783
00:54:46,715 --> 00:54:49,513

784
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:51,812
-怎么啦?  -我们得离开

00:54:51,882 --> 00:54:54,319
-什么? 去哪儿? -我想到阻止这事的办法
-What? Where? -I have an idea of how to stop this.

786
00:54:54,379 --> 00:54:56,718
阻止什么?
Stop what?

787
00:54:56,788 --> 00:54:58,715
-乔伊  -来吧  克莱

00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,719
-不要  -好的
-No. -Good.

791
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:09,147
集中精神  克莱
Concentrate, Clem.

792
00:55:09,216 --> 00:55:11,705
我们得回到医生的办公室去
We gotta get back to the offiice.

00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:14,313
那里有个盒式录音机  不  不是那幅画!

00:55:16,491 --> 00:55:19,549
在哪里?  这边走  来吧!

796
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:22,286
噢  看着我  我在那里看上很好
Oh, look at me. Hey, I look good there.

797

客户的档案是保密的  巴瑞斯先生
Look our files are confiidential, Mr. Barish,

798
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,051
我不能给你看

00:55:28,121 --> 00:55:31,518
这样说吧  克莱门汀女士
Suffiice it to say, that Miss, uh-- Miss Kruczynski

800
00:55:31,588 --> 00:55:35,455
她觉得很不快乐  她想要新的生活
was not happy and she wanted to move on.

801
00:55:35,525 --> 00:55:40,051
-现在告诉我关于克莱门汀的事  -所有你记得的事
Good. Now, tell me about Clementine. Just tell me everything you remember.

802
00:55:40,121 --> 00:55:42,988
-他是这么说的 -我们那天看到了什么?
That's what he said. Then-- What did we see that day?

00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:50,323
-乔尔  为什么  -不  我们不坐火车
Joel, why? -No, I don't want to. Joel, please! We're not going on a train.

806
00:55:50,393 --> 00:55:53,151
-请不要再让我跑了  -快!
Don't make me run anymore. Come on!

807
00:55:53,231 --> 00:55:55,558
米R维克医生!

808
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:58,596
-我们总是得逃吗?  -米R维克医生!
Do we always have to run? Mierzwiak!

809
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,897
求求你

00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:13,323
那么  为什么我们不从
So, why don't we begin by you telling me

米R维克医生!  让我醒来!
Mierzwiak! Wake me up!

813
00:56:18,129 --> 00:56:21,157
对不起  巴瑞斯先生
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

814
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:24,224
我想你知道所有这一切的原因
I thought you understood what was going on here.

815
00:56:24,294 --> 00:56:27,461
你不知道  你在消除我对她的记忆
I don't know. You're erasing her from me.

816
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:30,469
你在消除她
You're erasing me from her--

817
00:56:32,997 --> 00:56:34,935
我不知道
I don't know.

818
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:38,662
你是做这事的  我知道  我现在躺在自己床上
You've got this thing. I'm in my bed. I know it.

819
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:40,671
我在我自己的回忆中
I'm in my brain.

820
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,639
我也是你想象的一部分  乔尔
I'm part of your imagination too,Joel.

821
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:46,326
我不能帮你什么
How can I help you from there?

822
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:49,893
我也在你的大脑里  我就是你!
Uh, I'm inside your head too. I'm you.

823
00:56:49,972 --> 00:56:53,600
抱歉
Sorry..

824
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,728
瞧!  那是谁?
Look. Who's that?

825
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:57,856
他是我们的员工
Oh, he-he works for us.

826
00:56:57,936 --> 00:57:02,602
他是帕特里克!
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

827
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:05,260
宝贝男孩
baby boy.

828
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,828
他偷了我的身份
He's stealing my identity.

829
00:57:07,908 --> 00:57:10,306
他偷了我的东西
He stole my stuff.

830
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:14,063
他用我的语言和事物去引诱我的爱人
He's seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things.

831
00:57:14,143 --> 00:57:17,331
-他还偷了她的内裤
He stole her underwear.

832
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:19,338
他偷了她的内裤
He stole her underwear.

833
00:57:19,408 --> 00:57:22,806
我想现在就死去  克莱
I could die right now, Clem.

834
00:57:22,876 --> 00:57:25,343
我真的很高兴
I'm just happy.

835
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:29,999
我从未如此感受  我现在就在自己一直想去的地方
I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.

836
00:57:31,538 --> 00:57:33,537
我想回家了
I want to go home.

837
00:57:34,645 --> 00:57:36,574
什么?
Hey. What?

838
00:57:39,012 --> 00:57:42,639
克莱!
Clem!

839
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,698
等等  克莱!
Wait. Clem!

840
00:57:45,776 --> 00:57:47,975
克莱?
Clem?

841
00:57:48,044 --> 00:57:50,513
他们在清除你
They,'re erasing you.

842
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,511
我在这儿!
I'm here!

843
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,239
克莱  集中精神  他们是我雇的
Clem, focus. I hired them, okay?

844
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:57,246
对不起  我真愚蠢!
I'm so stupid.

845
00:57:57,316 --> 00:58:00,334
宝贝  冷静下来  观赏美景
Sweetie, calm down. Enjoy the scenery.

846
00:58:00,414 --> 00:58:03,741
在我醒来完全忘掉你之前  我得阻止他们
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.

847
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:09,606
那好  直接叫他们取消手术
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.

848
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,914
你在说什么?  我做不到  我现在是睡着的
What the hell are you talking about? I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

849
00:58:12,984 --> 00:58:14,742
那就把自己叫醒!
Wake yourself up!

850
00:58:14,812 --> 00:58:17,580
那好  你想我自己醒过来  好的
Okay. You want me to wake up? Okay. Great. All right.

851
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,547
来试试看  我这样能不能让你高兴?
Okay, here we go. This make you happy if I try? Yeah.

852
00:58:20,617 --> 00:58:23,645
我尽力试试 开始了  这真是个好主意
I'll try really hard. Here we go. That was a great idea.

853
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:29,151
这还真是有效
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.

854
00:58:29,221 --> 00:58:31,738
-不要!  那让我很痒!  -我的天
Don't! That tickles me! Oh, my, goodness.

855
00:58:31,818 --> 00:58:34,256
-天  那是什么?  -天 那是
Oh, my, God. What is that? Jesus Christ! What the--

856
00:58:34,316 --> 00:58:36,254
是个胎记!
It's a birthmark!

857
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:42,819
这的确有用但只一会儿
It did work, for a second,

858
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:45,407
-但我动不了  -看到了?
-but I couldn't-- I couldn't move. See?

859
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:50,153
那是另一个乔尔预言吗?
Well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

860
00:58:50,223 --> 00:58:52,551
用来证明我的主意是错的
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually.

861
00:58:52,621 --> 00:58:55,788
我不想谈这个  好吗?
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?

862
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:59,185
好的
Fine.

863
00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:02,243
接下来怎么办?  我在听着
Then what? I'm listening.

864
00:59:02,323 --> 00:59:05,020
-我也不知道  -你先清除了我
I don't know. You erased me.

865
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:07,748
所以我才会作这个清除术
That's why I'm here. That's why I'm doing this in the first place.

866
00:59:07,828 --> 00:59:09,757
-对不起  -你真是!
I'm sorry. You-- You!

867
00:59:09,826 --> 00:59:12,254
你了解我  我很冲动
You know me. I'm impulsive.

868
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:17,650
那就是为什么我爱你
That's what I love aboutyou.

869
00:59:21,426 --> 00:59:22,955
乔尔?
Joel?

870
00:59:23,025 --> 00:59:25,993
我有另一个解决问题的方法
I have anotheridea forthis problem.

871
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,321
现在我是你的回忆
This is a memory of me, The way

872
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:33,087
当你看到我的胯部  你就想和我在沙发上做爱
you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.

873
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:36,095
-什么?  -乔尔  那些人会找到这里
What? Joel, the eraser guys are coming here,

874
00:59:36,165 --> 00:59:39,152
为什么你不把我带到其它的地方去?
so what if you take me somewhere else,

875
00:59:39,232 --> 00:59:41,390
其它没有我的回忆中

01:04:19,948 --> 01:04:22,706
而且我无法找到他

他在为你做手术时爱上了你
He fell for you when they were doing you,

985

理解这工作中的细节
of the work that we do.

1007

而是与我共事的人所作的

01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:36,414
那么
All right.

1017
01:07:37,943 --> 01:07:39,881
-你想连上去么?  -是的
You want to get linked up? Yeah.

1018
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:42,239
好的
All right.

1019
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,938
我已经使用了检查程序
I already-- I ran the utility programs,

1020
01:07:45,008 --> 01:07:47,005
但并没找到什么
and I had nothing there,

1021
01:07:47,075 --> 01:07:50,073
所以我根据打印日志检查了所有的记忆扫描
so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.

1022
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,131
霍华德
Here, Howard. Okay.

1023
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:54,609
-请坐  -谢谢你
I got you a chair. There you go. Oh, Thank you.

1024

不用谢
You're welcome. Whew!

1025
01:07:57,317 --> 01:08:00,904
好的  我会检查他所有的记忆
All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go through the entire memory,

1026
01:08:00,984 --> 01:08:02,972
看看是怎么回事
see if something comes up.

1027
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:09,646
我亲爱的 我亲爱的克莱门汀
Oh my darling, oh my darling,Oh my darling Clementine

1028
01:08:09,716 --> 01:08:12,205
我喜欢在水槽里洗澡
I love being bathed in the sink.

1029
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:14,772
这感觉是多么的安全
Such a feeling of security.

1030
01:08:14,852 --> 01:08:18,080
我从来没见你这么高兴  乔尔宝贝
I've never seen you happier, baby Joel.

1031
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:20,088
在这儿
There it is.

1032
01:08:20,148 --> 01:08:24,485
我不能理解他怎么会跑到映像之外?
I don't understand why it's off the map like that.

1033
01:08:24,555 --> 01:08:26,612
他到底在那里干什么?
What the heck was he doing there?

1034
01:08:36,184 --> 01:08:38,173
他的眼晴睁开了
His eyes are open.

1035
01:08:40,052 --> 01:08:43,648
-以前睁开过吗?  -没有
-Has this happened before with him?  -No.

1036
01:08:43,718 --> 01:08:47,275
这不太妙
Oh, this is-- this is not good. No.

1037
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:49,583
我不得不
I'm gonna have to--

1038
01:08:49,653 --> 01:08:51,592
给他注射这个
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1039
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:18,619
难道你不知道吗?  我爱你
Can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1040
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:21,856
好的  正常了
Okay, we're back in.

1041
01:09:21,926 --> 01:09:26,153
干得真漂亮  霍华德
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.

1042
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:30,250
就像外科手术或音乐会的钢琴师
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.

1043
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,257
谢谢  玛丽
Thank you, Mary.

1044
01:09:32,327 --> 01:09:36,425
霍华德  你该去睡睡  我想我能处理了
Howard, you should get some sleep. I think I'll be fine now.

1045
01:09:36,495 --> 01:09:41,061
但难道你不知道吗?  我爱你  安托万
Why can't you see I love you, Antoine?

1046
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:43,118
我真幸运
Lucky me.

1047
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:47,595
来亲我吧
Lay one on me.

1048
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:50,862
别叫我安托万
Don't call me Antoine.

1049
01:09:50,932 --> 01:09:53,331
-我的名字是娃利  -我知道
My name is Wally. Yes, I know,

1050
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:55,958
但如果男人的名字叫娃利  哪个女人会爱呢?
but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?

1051
01:09:56,038 --> 01:09:58,436
那是什么?
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1052
01:09:58,506 --> 01:10:01,193
天啊  有人从你的屁股后冒出来
Hey. My God, there's people coming out of your butt.

1053
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,762
是吗?
There is?

1054
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:07,368
-找到了  -橘柑!
- Got it. - Tangerine!

1055
01:10:07,438 --> 01:10:10,456
-乔尔  你在干什么?  -我们得赶快走!
What, Joel-- What are you doing? We gotta go.

1056
01:10:10,536 --> 01:10:13,194
请快走  快走!
Go on. Please, please go. Please go!

1057
01:10:16,072 --> 01:10:17,929
你可以跑  但你躲藏不了
You can run but you can't hide.

1058
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:19,798
克莱  快跑!

记得的所有事开始
everything you remember--

1064
01:10:34,835 --> 01:10:38,743
这真奇怪  他还有已经清除掉了的记忆
That's strange. He's in a memory that we've already erased.

1065
01:10:38,813 --> 01:10:42,869
好吧 至少我们知道他在那里 可以追踪他了 对吧?
Oh, well, at least we know where he is. He's back on track, right?

1066
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,877
来吧  克莱
Come on, Clem.

1067
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:47,965
看起来他好像在反抗这个过程
He seems to have developed some sort of resistance to the procedure.

1068
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:50,632
-我不想再跑了  -糟了!
I don't want to run any,more. Shit.

1069

来吧 把我藏到更深的地方去 埋藏起来
Come on, come on. Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.

He's disappeared again.

I don't like it either.

1081
01:11:33,947 --> 01:11:36,474
我在尽力找到恐怖的秘密之地
I'm just trying to find horrible secret places to--

乔尔  我有一个惊喜
Joel, honey, I have a surprise-- I just--

那把我藏到更深的地方去
Then hide me somewhere-- somewhere really, buried.

我开始清楚情况了

霍华德  我喜欢看你工作
I like watching you work, Howard.

1144
01:15:52,162 --> 01:15:54,649
我想
I guess, uh--

1145
01:15:54,729 --> 01:15:57,527
出去呼吸新鲜空气
I guess I'll go out for-- for some air,

1146
01:15:57,597 --> 01:15:59,585
如果没人介意的话
if nobody minds.

1147
01:15:59,665 --> 01:16:02,853
看来这里的一切都在控制之中了
It looks like you have everything under control here.

1148
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,860
是的
Yeah, that's, uh--

1149
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,859
好吧
that's fine.

1150
01:16:16,561 --> 01:16:19,559

1154
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:31,529
我偶然读到一些  你可能也会喜欢
and in my reading, I've come across some I thought you might like too.

1155

那好  说来听听
Oh, well, I-- I'd love to hear some.

1156
01:16:35,335 --> 01:16:37,764
这里有一句说
There's one that goes,

1157
01:16:37,834 --> 01:16:41,320
祝福那些健忘的人吧 因为他们战胜了自己过去的错误
Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders.

1158
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,339
-是尼采说的 对吧? -对
That's Nietzsche, right? Yeah.

1159
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:46,396
-我以为我可以说句你不知道 -噢 不
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn't know. Oh, no.

我一直告诫自己不要说成了教皇亚历山大
It's just that I told myself I not to say Pope Alexander and

1165
01:17:04,072 --> 01:17:06,059
但我还是这样说了 像个傻瓜

-这没什么大不了的  -你真是甜心

我没听过这句  真美

我想也许这句合你心意

01:21:26,783 --> 01:21:30,369
-你好  -你好
Hi. Hi.

1216
01:21:30,449 --> 01:21:34,387
我没想到你还会来见我
Didn't figure you'd show your face around me again.

1217
01:21:34,447 --> 01:21:37,683
我猜你感到羞耻
I guess I thought you were humiliated.

1218
01:21:37,753 --> 01:21:39,722
毕竟你逃跑了
You did run away after all.

1219
01:21:39,782 --> 01:21:42,549
我只是想看看你
I just needed to see you.

1220
01:21:42,619 --> 01:21:44,918
什么?
Yeah?

1221
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:47,715
我想
I'd like to,

1222
01:21:47,785 --> 01:21:50,753
带你出去逛逛或干点什么
take you out or something.

1223
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,380
你已结婚了
You're married.

1224

01:21:57,956 --> 01:22:00,974
瞧 伙计 我现在就告诉你 我的要求很高
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1227
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:05,610
我不会做你的情妇
so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage

1228
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:08,019
或什么第三者
or whatever it is you've got going there.

1229
01:22:08,088 --> 01:22:11,215
如果你想作我的恋人  就只能是我一个
if you wanna be with me, you're with me.

1230
01:22:11,285 --> 01:22:13,454
好的
Okay.

1231
01:22:13,524 --> 01:22:16,421
很多男孩认为我是一个完美的概念
Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them,

1232
01:22:16,491 --> 01:22:19,289
我使他们感到完整或真正的活着
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1233
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:22,986
但我只是一个寻找内心宁静的混乱女孩
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1234
01:22:23,056 --> 01:22:27,722
-别把你的想法强加给我  -我很清楚的记得这话
Don't assign me yours. I remember that speech really well.

1235
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:31,278
-我让你记住我了吧?  -你让全人类都记住你了
I had you pegged didn't I? You had the whole human race pegged.

1236
01:22:31,358 --> 01:22:33,347
也许吧
Hmm. Probably.

1237
01:22:35,526 --> 01:22:37,823
我仍然认为你会回来拯救我的一生
I still thought you were gonna save my life,

1238
01:22:37,893 --> 01:22:39,832
即便我们都忘记了彼此
even after that.

1239
01:22:39,892 --> 01:22:43,288
我知道的
I know.

1240
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,616
一切都会不同的
It would be different

1241
01:22:48,764 --> 01:22:51,162
如果我们能再有一个机会
If we could just give it another go around.

1242
01:22:55,129 --> 01:22:57,497
记住我
Remember me.

1243
01:22:57,567 --> 01:22:59,555
尽你的最大努力
Try your best.

1244
01:23:01,903 --> 01:23:03,832
也许我们能够做到
Maybe we can.

1245
01:23:35,066 --> 01:23:38,004
好了  告诉我你还记得些什么
Okay, so just tell me what you remember,

1246
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:40,661
我们会把它清除掉
and, uh, then we'll take it from there.

1247
01:23:40,741 --> 01:23:42,969
好的
Okay.

1248
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:45,936
我对你一见钟情
I liked you immediately.

1249
01:23:46,006 --> 01:23:48,495
但你却不解风情
You didn't come on to me at all.

1250
01:23:48,575 --> 01:23:51,562
我喜欢那样
I liked that.

1251
01:23:51,642 --> 01:23:54,610
起初 在你身边我连话都说不出来
I was so tongue-tied around you at first.

1252
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:57,337
我只是想让你觉得我很聪明
I wanted you to think I was smart.

1253
01:23:58,536 --> 01:24:00,874
我迫不及待想和你工作
I couldn't wait to come to work.

1254
01:24:00,944 --> 01:24:04,431
我幻想我们结婚
I had these fantasies of us being married

1255
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:07,868
抚养小孩 只是
and having kids and just--

1256
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:10,636
哦  我不能这么做
Oh, I can't do this.

1257
01:24:10,706 --> 01:24:13,304
我们都同意这样做是最好的  玛丽
We agreed it's forthe best, Mary..

1258
01:24:13,373 --> 01:24:15,842
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

1259
01:24:15,912 --> 01:24:17,840
天啊!
Oh, God.

1260
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:20,268
-我来拿底部  -不 不
I'll take the bottom and you-- No, no, no. Here.

1261
01:24:20,348 --> 01:24:22,277
-我搬得动  -你想我拿那个吗?
I can take that. So you want me to carry that?

1262
01:24:22,347 --> 01:24:24,834
-帮我一把  -亲爱的  你能拿螺旋桨吗?
Help me with that. Can you get the cooler? Honey, the cooler is--

1263
01:24:24,914 --> 01:24:27,502
-那很轻 - 让我来搬
That's light, huh? Oh, I can get that. You can get it.

-不要动任何东西  -我可以拿那飞机

1266
01:24:31,808 --> 01:24:34,805
把东西收拾好  关上车门
Put the thing up. Put the gate back up.

1267
01:24:37,044 --> 01:24:39,772
这是我们初遇的那天
This is the day,we met.

1268
01:24:39,852 --> 01:24:43,039
你站在海浪前  我就在远方画着你
You were down by the surf. I could just make you out in the distance.

1269
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:45,238
我记得就在那时  我被深深吸引住
I remember being drawn to you even then.

1270
01:24:45,318 --> 01:24:49,444
我想 哈 奇怪 我在画别人的背
I thought, "Wow, how odd. I'm drawn to someone's back. "

1271
01:24:51,212 --> 01:24:54,380
那件让我牢牢记住的运动衫
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well.

1272
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:56,418
充满爱恨交织
and even hate, eventually.

1273
01:24:56,488 --> 01:25:00,475
当时我想  太酷了  橙黄色的运动衫
At the time I thought, " How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1274

我刚才看见你
I saw you sitting over here

1276
01:25:08,347 --> 01:25:10,286
独自坐在这儿
by yourself,

1277
01:25:10,356 --> 01:25:13,254
于是我想  感谢上帝
and I thought, "Thank God.

1278
01:25:13,324 --> 01:25:16,111
原来还有不会玩这些东西的正常人
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."

1279
01:25:16,191 --> 01:25:18,310
是啊
Yeah.

1280
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:21,407
我不知该说些什么
I don't ever know what to say.

1281
01:25:21,487 --> 01:25:24,215
我是克莱门汀
I'm Clementine.

1282

我能吃块你的鸡肉吗?
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?

1283

你就直接拿了
And then you just took it

1284
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,348
连我的回答都不等
without waiting for an answer.

1285
01:25:35,895 --> 01:25:38,383
如此亲密
It was so intimate,

没有狗

今晚没人会来这儿 相信我
Nobody's coming here tonight. Believe me.

1315
01:27:46,376 --> 01:27:48,315
真黑
It's dark.

1316
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:52,371
你女朋友叫什么名字?
So, what's your girlfriend's name?

1317
01:27:52,451 --> 01:27:55,679
内奥米 但我们真的没有

1321
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:08,178
天!
Oh, God.

我想我们该走了
I think we should go.

1323
01:28:14,682 --> 01:28:17,281
-电话不通  -什么?
There's no phone line. What?

1324

今晚这就是我们的房子

我们是"大卫和鲁思・拉什金"

你想当谁?
Which one do you want to be?

1328
01:28:28,851 --> 01:28:32,338
我想当鲁思  但我当其他的也行
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.

1329
01:28:33,857 --> 01:28:37,184
拜托

Alcohol! Oh, boy.

你喝酒吗?
So, Are you okay with wine?

1332
01:28:42,219 --> 01:28:44,878
-我不知道  -你来选酒
I don't know. Well, you choose the wine.

1333
01:28:44,958 --> 01:28:49,184
我去找卧室  去找更多鲁思的东西
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth.

1334
01:28:52,591 --> 01:28:55,349
-我此时很凶残  -我真的该走了
I'm Ruth-less at the moment. I really should go.

1335
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:00,215
我得赶去坐车
I've gotta catch my ride.

1336
01:29:02,063 --> 01:29:04,551
那走吧!
So go.

1337
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:06,719
我走了
I did.

1338
01:29:06,789 --> 01:29:09,656
我想你也许是个疯子
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1339
01:29:09,726 --> 01:29:12,525
但你只是兴奋
but you were exciting.

1340
01:29:13,624 --> 01:29:15,562
我希望你留下
I wish you'd stayed.

1341
01:29:15,632 --> 01:29:18,320
我也希望我留下  现在我希望我留下
I wish I'd stayed too. Now I wish I'd stayed.

1342
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:21,447
我希望自己做过很多事
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1343
01:29:21,527 --> 01:29:23,855
上帝  我希望
Oh, God, I wish I had--

1344
01:29:27,832 --> 01:29:30,960
我真的希望我能留下
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1345
01:29:31,029 --> 01:29:33,307
-当我下楼来时  你已经走了
Well, I came back down stairs and you were gone.

1346
01:29:33,307 --> 01:29:35,585
-我出去了  我从门口出去了
-I walked out. I walked out the door.

1347
01:29:35,665 --> 01:29:38,493
-为什么?  -我不知道  我像个吓坏的小孩一样
Why? I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid.

1348
01:29:38,563 --> 01:29:41,890
我就像  我想不出来  我不知道
I was like-- It was above my head. I don't know.

1349
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:43,898
你吓坏了?
You were scared?

1350
01:29:43,968 --> 01:29:45,897
是的
Yeah.

1351
01:29:46,936 --> 01:29:49,553
我想你了解我那一点
Thought you knew that about me.

1352
01:29:49,633 --> 01:29:53,621
我想我跑到篝火那里  逃避我的羞辱
I ran back to the bonfiire trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1353
01:29:53,701 --> 01:29:57,327
-是我说错了什么吗?  -是的
Was it something I said? Yeah.

1354
01:30:00,104 --> 01:30:02,503
你说 "那走吧"
You said, "So go"

1355
01:30:02,573 --> 01:30:05,030
用那样轻蔑的口气  你知道吗?
with such disdain, you know?

1356
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,728
-对不起  -没什么
Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay.

1357
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:15,233
乔伊?
Joely?

1358
01:30:15,302 --> 01:30:18,170
如果你这次留下来会怎么样?
What if you stayed this time?

1359
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:23,465
我已走出了门
I walked out the door.

1360
01:30:23,535 --> 01:30:25,474
没有记忆留下了
There's no memory left.

1361
01:30:25,544 --> 01:30:28,661
那至少回来告别
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.

1362
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:30,669
假装至少我们告别过
Let's pretend we had one.

1363
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,268
别了 乔尔
Bye, Joel.

1364
01:30:44,337 --> 01:30:46,276
我爱你
I love you.

1365
01:30:46,346 --> 01:30:50,602
到蒙塔克来找我
Meet me in Montauk.

1366
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:58,476
飞机坠毁了  不是我让它坠毁的
I didn't crash the plane. The plane crashed. I didn't crash the plane.

1367
01:30:58,546 --> 01:31:02,632
是你用遥控器把飞机坠毁的
You were operating the plane with the remote control and then it crashed.

1368
01:31:02,712 --> 01:31:05,041
风太大了
It was fucking windy. Come on, man.

1369
01:31:05,111 --> 01:31:07,079
你晕晕的还硬要开车
You're stoned, and you're driving.

1370
01:31:07,149 --> 01:31:09,707
是的  白粉使我平衡  白粉使我兴奋
Yeah, the pot balances it out. The pot brings you back up.

1371
01:31:09,777 --> 01:31:12,304
所以我想喝酒时就会去吸它
That's why I smoke it. If I'm going to be drinking then I'll smoke it.

1372
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:16,002
的确有效  在科学网络上
It does. That's a medical fiact.

1373
01:31:16,082 --> 01:31:18,509
这是被医学证实了的
It was proven on the Science Network.

1374
01:31:18,579 --> 01:31:21,017
-宝贝  看好路  -我什么也看不见
Honey, just watch the road. I can't see shit.

1375
01:31:23,585 --> 01:31:26,573
我看见你和一个漂亮的女性谈话
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.

1376
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:29,480
-她人很好  -是的  那是谁?
She was nice. Yeah, man. Who was that?

1377
01:31:31,579 --> 01:31:34,875
她只是一个女孩
She was, um, just a girl.

1378
01:31:42,389 --> 01:31:45,248
完了
Okay.

1379
01:32:20,727 --> 01:32:23,486
那我把卡车开回去
So I gotta-- I gotta drop the van off.

1380

谢谢  斯坦  谢谢
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1381
01:32:25,723 --> 01:32:29,061
我们以后再谈
We'll talk.

1382
01:33:53,471 --> 01:33:56,198
-你拿走了很多你的东西  -是的  我的东西
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see. Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1383
01:33:56,278 --> 01:33:59,706
我知道你不会再回来  要是我也会这么做
I take it you're not coming back. I wouldn't come back if l was you either.

1384
01:33:59,776 --> 01:34:03,502
-你敢发誓你不知道么?  -我发誓
Do you swear you didn't know? I swear.

1385
01:34:03,572 --> 01:34:07,169
-是你给我做的记忆清除吗?  -不是  上帝作证
So you didn't do the erasing? Of course not. God, no.

1386
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:09,437
难道你没怀疑过我和他曾是一对?
And you never even suspected we were together?

1387
01:34:09,507 --> 01:34:13,733
也许有一次
Once, maybe.

1388
01:34:13,813 --> 01:34:16,801
我工作回来  你在车里
I was coming back from a job and you were at his car.

1389
01:34:16,881 --> 01:34:19,469
我看见你俩在交谈
I saw you two talking.

1390
01:34:19,549 --> 01:34:23,275
我向你招手  你冲我笑
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.

1391
01:34:23,345 --> 01:34:25,644
我看上去怎样?
How'd I look?

1392
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:29,010
看上去很高兴
You looked happy.

1393
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,339
高兴有着自己的秘密
Happy with a secret.

1394
01:34:32,748 --> 01:34:34,676
以后呢?
And after that?

1395
01:34:34,746 --> 01:34:37,904
我再也没有看见你俩像那样了  所以我想
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just--

1396
01:34:37,983 --> 01:34:41,670
那也许只是自己的想象
I don't know. I just figured I was imagining things.

1397
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:08,937
我真的喜欢你 玛丽・斯皮尔
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

让我先去刷牙
Let me get my toothbrush.

1401
01:36:15,262 --> 01:36:17,820
你在哪儿  克莱? 我很担心.
Where are you, Clem? I'm worried.

1402
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:22,266
我感觉你对我火气很大  我不知道自己做了什么
I feel like you're mad at me and I don't know what I did.

1403
01:36:22,336 --> 01:36:25,094
我做了什么?
What did I do?

1404

Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you're okay.

真棒?
Nice?

01:36:57,867 --> 01:37:01,104
我一生中过得最棒的一夜是
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life

1412
01:37:01,174 --> 01:37:03,102
昨晚

1413
01:37:03,172 --> 01:37:05,161
很好
That's better.

1414
01:37:08,268 --> 01:37:12,464
-这真怪  -致所有霍华德医生的病人们
This is weird. To all patients of Dr.Howard Mierzwiak.

我叫玛丽・斯皮尔 你们见过我 但你们已不记得我了
My name is Mary Svevo. We've met, but you don't remember me.

1416
01:37:16,112 --> 01:37:20,538
我为一间你们雇来消除  你们部分回忆的公司工作
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."

1417
01:37:20,608 --> 01:37:23,135
当我发现这很可怕后
I have since decided that this is a horrible.

1418
01:37:23,205 --> 01:37:27,761
为了补偿  我把档案寄还给每一个人
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's fiile back to them.

1419

我是克莱门汀・克罗斯基

1420
01:37:31,509 --> 01:37:34,236
我来清除对乔尔・巴瑞斯的回忆
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1421
01:37:34,306 --> 01:37:36,535
-这是什么?  -我不知道
What is this? I don't know.

1422
01:37:36,615 --> 01:37:41,201
他很无聊 这理由足够清除对他的回忆吗?
He's boring. Is that enough reason to erase someone?

1423
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,967
我最近在想  以前的我和现在的我差异太大
I've been thinking lately, how I was before and how I am now,

1424
01:37:45,047 --> 01:37:46,976
他改变了我
and it's like he changed me.

1425
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:48,924
现在我总是很生气
I feel like I'm alway's pissy, now.

1426
01:37:48,924 --> 01:37:50,812
和他在一起时  我不再像是我自己
I don't like myself when I'm with him. I don't like myself anymore.

1427
01:37:50,882 --> 01:37:55,469
我甚至不能忍受看见他  那悲惨  懦弱的笑容
I can't stand to even look at him. That pathetic wimpy apologetic smile.

1428
01:37:55,549 --> 01:37:57,147
-那真是个令人讨厌的家伙 知道吗?
-That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?

1429
01:37:57,147 --> 01:37:58,746
-你在干什么?
-What are you doing?

1430
01:37:58,746 --> 01:38:00,025
-我什么也没干
I 'm not doing anything.

1431
01:38:00,025 --> 01:38:01,314
-我和他之间的爱情玫瑰已凋谢了
-The bloom is certainly fucking off i the rose at this point.

1432
01:38:01,314 --> 01:38:04,301
-你在耍我吗?  -没有!
-Are you screwing with me? -No!

1433
01:38:04,381 --> 01:38:06,810
-你在耍我!  -乔尔  我没有

01:39:31,228 --> 01:39:33,217
真的没受过多少教育
Really, very. educated.

1442
01:39:33,297 --> 01:39:36,734
我的意思是  她很聪明  但没受过多少教育
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.

1443
01:39:36,794 --> 01:39:39,692
我没办法和她谈论书籍  你知道吗?
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?

1444
01:39:39,762 --> 01:39:43,199
她只是个喜欢看杂志的女孩
She's more of a magazine-reading girl.

1445
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:46,666
她的用词发音很差
Her vocabulary. Leaves something to be desired.

1446
01:39:46,736 --> 01:39:49,394
有时令我在公共场所感到难堪
Sometimes-- I was embarrassed in public

1447
01:39:49,464 --> 01:39:51,452
-你好  -因为她会把
Hi. because she would pronounce

1448
01:39:51,532 --> 01:39:54,299
-图书馆都读错
Library. "libary.. " Hi.

1449
01:39:57,567 --> 01:39:59,495
看我找到了什么
Look what I found.

1450
01:39:59,565 --> 01:40:03,902
我想克莱门汀真正吸引人的地方
I think ifithere's a truly seductive quality about Clementine,

1451
01:40:03,972 --> 01:40:07,629
就是她的个性能让你忘却世俗烦恼
it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane.

1452
01:40:09,008 --> 01:40:11,335
你把我画得皮包骨
You made me look skinny.

1453
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:13,964
她就像燃烧的流星
Amazing, burning meteorite

1454
01:40:14,033 --> 01:40:18,330
载着你去极乐之地
will carry you to another world where things are exciting.

1455
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,428
但你很快就会发现
But what you quickly learn is that

1456
01:40:21,507 --> 01:40:24,335
那只不过是精心设计的圈套
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1457
01:40:24,405 --> 01:40:26,393
对不起冲你大喊大叫
I'm sorry yelled at you.

1458
01:40:28,001 --> 01:40:30,730
-没什么  -一种显而易见、华而不实的圈套
It's okay. So flashy, in a kind of obvious way.

1459
01:40:32,438 --> 01:40:34,996
-但那仍然诱惑着你  -乔尔  我真的喜欢你
But still, it seduces you. Joel, I really like you.

1460
01:40:35,076 --> 01:40:37,304
我恨自己说了你的坏话
I hate that I said mean things about you.

1461
01:40:37,374 --> 01:40:41,830
-我关掉录音机  好吗?  -等等  这很公平
-Let me turn this off, okay? - Hey, it's-- it's only fiair.

1462
01:40:43,179 --> 01:40:45,137
真实的克莱门汀在哪里?
Where's the real Clementine?

1463
01:40:45,207 --> 01:40:48,335
她发型能有什么狗屁意义?  简直是扯蛋!
I mean the whole thing with the hair-- it's all bullshit.

1464
01:40:48,405 --> 01:40:51,132
-我真的喜欢你的发型  -谢谢你
- I really like your hair. -Thank you.

1465
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,441
-真的喜欢  -谢谢你
I really like your hair. Thank you.

1466
01:40:53,511 --> 01:40:55,438
-我真的  -整个世界都混乱了
I do. The world's a goddamn mess.

1467
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:57,327
-她想靠改变头发颜色突出反叛个性吗?
Is it some kind of a revolt? Change your hair color.

1468
01:40:57,327 --> 01:40:59,136
-你想喝点什么?
-You want a drink or something?

1469
01:40:59,216 --> 01:41:01,943
有威士忌吗?
Do you have any whiskey?

1470
01:41:02,013 --> 01:41:07,309
不  我不认为她的性生活是有目的的
No, I don't think her sex is motivated.

1471
01:41:07,379 --> 01:41:10,367
昨晚我们在一起时  我看得很清楚
I saw it clearly the last night we were together.

1472
01:41:10,447 --> 01:41:13,843
那不是性生活  那是悲哀!
It wasn't sex. It was just sad.

1473
01:41:13,913 --> 01:41:16,971
对不起  我以为威士忌还有很多
Hey. Sorry. I thought there was more.

1474
01:41:17,051 --> 01:41:20,708
克莱认为让人们喜欢她的唯一方法就是
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her

1475
01:41:20,778 --> 01:41:23,615
和他们上床
is to fuck

1476
01:41:23,685 --> 01:41:27,912
或至少给出这个可能
or at least dangle the possibility of getting fucked in front of them.

1477
01:41:27,982 --> 01:41:30,919
她是如此的绝望和没有安全感
And she's so desperate and insecure

1478
01:41:30,979 --> 01:41:35,815
迟早她会和所有人上床
that she'll sooner or later go around fucking everybody.

1479
01:41:35,885 --> 01:41:38,903
-我不是那样  -我不会那样想你
I don't do that. I wouldn't think that about you.

1480
01:41:38,983 --> 01:41:41,880
-因为我不是  -我知道
-Because I don't. -I know.

1481
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:45,178
但你那样说真的很伤我心  因为我不是那样的人
Because it really hurts me that you said that because I don't do that.

1482
01:41:45,248 --> 01:41:48,345
-很对不起  -对不起  我得走了
I'm so sorry. I 'm sorry about all this. I 'm gonna go.

1483
01:41:48,415 --> 01:41:53,221
我感到迷惑  我想我真的不能在这里待下去
I'm a little confused. I don't really think I can be here.

1484
01:42:01,084 --> 01:42:03,712
-别了  -我以为自己很了解她
Bye. I thought I knew her so well.

1485
01:42:03,792 --> 01:42:07,379
-能认识你真好  -但我根本就不了解她
It was nice meeting you and all. But I don't know her at all.

1486
01:42:08,687 --> 01:42:12,055
经过了这么长的时间
What a loss to spend that much time with someone,

1487
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:16,022
才发现她是最熟悉的陌生人
only to fiind out that she's a stranger.

1488
01:42:19,328 --> 01:42:21,317
等等!
Wait.

1489
01:42:22,996 --> 01:42:24,924
-什么?  -我不知道
What? I don't know.

1490
01:42:24,994 --> 01:42:27,152
-你想要怎样  乔尔? 就等一会儿!
Just wait. Just wait. What do you want, Joel?

1491
01:42:27,222 --> 01:42:31,748
我不知道  我只想你再等等
I don't know. I want you to wait for just a while.

1492
01:42:45,297 --> 01:42:47,985
-好的  -真的?
Okay. Really?

1493
01:42:48,065 --> 01:42:50,123
我不是一个完美的概念  乔尔
I'm not a concept, Joel.

1494
01:42:50,123 --> 01:42:52,192
我只是一个寻找内心宁静的混乱女孩
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of i mind.

1495
01:42:52,262 --> 01:42:56,198
-我并不完美  -我找不到不去爱你的理由
-I'm not perfect. -I can't see anything that I don't like about you.

1496
01:42:56,268 --> 01:42:58,955
-我找不到  -但你会的
Right now I can't. But you will. But you will.

1497
01:42:59,035 --> 01:43:00,844
你知道  你会找到的
You know, you will think of things,

1498
01:43:00,844 --> 01:43:02,653
而我会对你感到厌倦  觉得拘束
and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped

1499
01:43:02,733 --> 01:43:04,791
因为这以前就发生过
because that's what happens with me.

1500
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:08,198
好吧
Okay.

1501
01:43:11,895 --> 01:43:13,894
好吧?
Okay.

1502
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,157
-好的  -好的
Okay. Okay.
