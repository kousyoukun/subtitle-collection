they're hitting us on monday

72
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,565
when we're carrying the weekend wall receipts

73
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,029

74
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,053

76
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,921

yeah,nine millimeter,we haven't run ballistics

82
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,411

84
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,339
I thought,you said they were gloves

85
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,041
government will load this weapon
before putting on gloves

86

the leader sacrificed one of his men

92
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:25,004
to keep him from talking to the enemy

93
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,060

armored truck guard is done with the paramedics

99
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:35,297

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,589
the last time,I heard that

110
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,120
you were one step away from badging up down in long beach

111
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:55,721
uh,yeah,it didn't work out

112
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,150

did you happen to see any of these guys?

127
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:18,192
they all wore masks that I could see

128
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:20,192
they dropped in on us like commandos

129
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:21,871

00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:44,665
lots of honking

140
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,059
you have to rent someone over not to get a license

141
00:07:49,222 --> 00:07:53,221
I have to wait four weeks for another appointment

142
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,341

made her first cost as deputy sheriff back

150
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:10,489
in black creek missouri

151
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:12,587
why does she want to move there?

152
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,989
she missed her mom and stepdad

153
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,339
I understand

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,940
family is very important

155
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,044
okay,okay,

156
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,076

oh,you're a lifesaver jane

167
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,539
I went over the armored car manifests

168
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,261
and even though the routes were changed

169
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:46,962
at last minute this crew still knew

170
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:48,362
where to hit the truck

171
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:49,852
so,if there's an inside guy

172
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,540
who's our most likely candidate

173
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,038
you're not gonna like this

174
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:54,058
Andy Stallworth

175
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,999
he was the only guy in the truck who had access to the new route list

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
well,just because the guy dropped off the force

177
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,998
doesn't mean that he's our guy

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,476
I talked to his co-workers

179
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,776
they say,andy's got a gambling problem

180
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
all right

181
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,066
I'll go

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
ah

183
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,600
pretty crazy place,Sammo

184
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:21,222
you should see the tattoo palace in shanghai

185
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:22,223
yeah

186
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,721
can I help you?boys

187
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:26,451
I certainly hope so

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,940
we've been hitting tattoo parlors all morning

189
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:30,480
hoping someone can tell us

190
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,000
a little about this particular design

191
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,300
oh,yeah,I do one of those every now and again

192
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:36,288
stands for liberty republic

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,933
they're a bunch of aryan nation wannabes

194
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,573
I always wiggle the needle around

195
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,461
make sure it hurts

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,101
well,it's area nation

197
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,777
they're a hate group,Sammo

198
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:47,987
who do they hate?

199
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,778
I guess they hate anybody

200
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,168
that doesn't have the same skin color as they do

201
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,280
which means

202
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:54,558
they wouldn't like you

203
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:57,055
only unhappy people worry about their skin color

204
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,000
oh,forget about those liberty republic creeps

205
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,312
now,how about a tattoo?

206
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,848
I don't think so

207
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:04,255
thank you,we'll pass

208
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,747
oh,can I persuade you

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,298
take a look

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,245
are those birds?

211
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,311
peacocks

212
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,276
you have very beautiful peacocks

213
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,322
thank you

214
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,007
Sammo

215
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,731
welcome to elaine,my friend

216
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,140
hi,Kristen

217
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,337
how did you know my name?

218
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,124
I used to work with your dad,is he around?

219
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,436
he's in the shower

220
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,777
could you tell him?

221
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:36,677
I'd like to see him,please,I'm a police officer

222
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,979
do you have a badge?

223
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,020
see,I'm with the los angeles police department

224
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,339
you're a lieutenant

225
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,344
yes

226
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:49,021
you're old enough to be a captain

227
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,999
just tell your dad

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,675
lieutenant winship is here

229
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
why

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,289
he'll know why

231
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,010
but,if he asks me why

232
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:02,014
could you please just go get your dad?

233
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,079
okay

234
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,079
thank you

235
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:10,899
I signed up with case security

236
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,666
after I struck out in long beach

237
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:14,703
you get a black mark from the lapd

238
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:16,080
it's hard to share

239
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:17,687
eddie,there was no black mark

240
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,881
you took disability leave they told you

241
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:21,999
you could come back,but,
you put your own papers in pretend

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,779
No...I'm not blaming anyone

243
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,007
I left the force

244
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,389
because,I couldn't focus

245
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:28,202
your wife was dying to cancer,man

246
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:29,602
it's perfectly understandable

247
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:35,016
I know you didn't come here to talk about this

248
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,112
what's up?

249
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
well

250
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
we think there was an inside,man

251
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,061
and fingers are starting to point at you

252
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
why?

253
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,055
because,I have the pickup roots

254
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:49,009
put yourself in my shoes

255
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,131
it's routine

256
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,499
like other companies were hit

257
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,699
not just us

258
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:54,745
you think

259
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:56,645
I have inside knowledge on all of them

260
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,201
it's a line of investigation

261
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,865
and you know how it works

262
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,287
I'm not your guy

263
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:03,677
okay

264
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,089
then,tell me about your gambling debts

265
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,100
after nancy died,I went off the deep end

266
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:12,721
I started to hit the tables

267
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:15,100
look,daddy,I'm kicking my legs

268
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,388
that's great,honey

269
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,009
Kristen's the only reason I survived

270
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,729
I'm getting my act together here

271
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,707
I swear,I had nothing to do with these heists

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
yeah,I want to believe in andy

273
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:31,024
I do

274
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,007
I got to go

275
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,222
see you again

276
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,139
I'll keep my eyes open

277
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,799
maybe,I can turn up something for you

278
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:45,744
More higher

279
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:46,745
yeah

280
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,766
Cooper,you know better than to sneak up on a soldier

281
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,101
when he's firing his gun

282
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:04,062
I want to cash out

283
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,220
when you signed down to this operation

284
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,922
you made a commitment to the cause

285
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,040
that would give a damn,that's your cause

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
in fact,

287
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:19,107
you and your potential buddies want to go on back to idaho

288
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:20,707
and start your own country go right ahead

289
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,085
I just,uh,

290
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:24,109
I want my share of the take

291
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:25,250
two more jobs

292
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:28,433
that's what you contracted for that's what you're gonna do

293
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,186
well,how do I know

294
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:34,409
that I'm not gonna end up with a bullet in the back like crimes

295
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
crimes was a casualty war

296
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,289
I want you to check something out

297
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:50,086
take a good look at this brother

298
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,461
did you do that?

299
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:55,566
yeah

300
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,396
it's not bad

301
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,855
I just want you to see

302
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,465
what you're gonna look like

303
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:01,999
if we ever have this conversation again

304
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,205
take it easy

305
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,029
GRANCE

306
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,154
do you have an idea on our tattoo toe tag

307
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,532
I'm still working on it,

308
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:20,821
but,better yet

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
the lab got a hit on a partial thumb print from the casing

310
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:25,325
that Sammo found

311
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,000
Bobby Lee Sommerset

312
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,301
a local freelancer with

313
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,101
a sheep for armed robbery

314
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:34,010
and it seems when Bobby's not busy playing trigger man

315
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,319
he's out surfing

316
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:37,387
he's got a condo in santa monica

317
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,187
good work,all right,call Louis and Sammo

318
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:41,120
I want them to go wax bobby's board

319
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,325
okay,I'm on it

320
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,089
looks like the big kahuna right here,Sammo

321
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,078
obeal Sommerset 202

322
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,755
you ever try surf and,Sammo

323
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:06,345
sure,on the net

324
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:08,169
Man

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,239
what do you say

326
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,879
we start buzzing in other apartments

327
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,119
I guess not

328
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:21,305
what do you see,Sammo

329
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,099
the apartment is stuck inside

330
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,026
but,the candles are burning

331
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,301
go there

332
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:28,325
where

333
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:29,349
there

334
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,060
right there

335
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:33,984
do this

336
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and this

337
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,598
all right,don't tell me

338
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,200
best part about working with you

339
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,500
is definitely the surprises

340
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,088
yes,Sammo,you're like spider-man

388
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000

389
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:10,301

he's not gonna give us anything,lieutenant

397
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:36,999
whoever he's working for?

398
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,677
He hasn't good and scared

399
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:39,688
I'm thinking

400
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:42,000
this guy's just a hired help like Bobby Lee

401
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:43,701
yeah,how do you know?

402
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:44,702

404
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:48,366

405
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,999

406
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,781
our dead bad guy from the heist

407
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,899
ex-army ranger served in desert storm last known address is hadley idaho

408
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,160
which also happens to be the home of the liberty republic

409
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,399
who the atf suspects of gun running

410
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
and dealing explosives

411
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,479
the fbi seems to think

412
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,079
they're responsible for burning down several churches

413
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,800
and synagogues across the midwest

414
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
so,these guys are robbing armored trucks

415
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,716
to finance their activities

416
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,108

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,619
I hear you

466
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:20,167

467
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:22,069
does your brother still work at the dmv?

468
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:23,376
no,you need a favor,huh?

469
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,060
actually Sammo does

470
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,409
see!my man here,

471
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,023
he's gonna have his wheels parked

472
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:30,412
if he doesn't get a hurry up appointment at the dmv

473
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,512
they're telling him,he has to wait four weeks

474
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,307
and it's a long time without a license

475
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,004
tell you what

476
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:39,021
you helped me with a little demonstration

477
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,800
I'll see what I can do for you,Sammo

478
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:44,102
maybe,you should find a different volunteer

479
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:45,402
they were you crazy

480
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:46,543
I think maybe

481
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:48,304
no,I...I think,he's perfect for this

482
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:50,000
david,I think,you should find a different box

483
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,072
no,listen

484
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:54,119
waited weeks for the delivery of these sticks

485
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,019
35 hours of intensive training

486
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:59,223
from the best instructor in the marine corps

487
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:03,165
I'm prepared,but,hey,Sammo

488
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,045
if you're afraid,you're gonna get hurt

489
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
okay

490
00:23:07,024 --> 00:23:09,024
what do you want me to do?

491
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,700
all right,class,listen up

492
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,899
today's lesson is

493
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,299
a demonstration on how to deal with an opponent

494
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,054
who has a weapon other than a knife or a gun

495
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,400
detective law here has agreed to help me

496
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,790
with a little demonstration

497
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000

499
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,199
come on,this ain't mime class

500
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
hit me

501
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,539
that was just a little example

502
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,399
of what should you look for from your opponent

503
00:24:08,104 --> 00:24:09,684
here's another example

504
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:23,280
are you okay?

505
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,113

506
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:29,337
I'll get your appointment

507
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,109

508
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,500

509
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,080
t c e f p b

510
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:46,277
you're sure

511
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:48,191
very clear to me

512
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,899
t c e f g

513
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,235
this is pathetic,man

514
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:55,132
I've been waiting over an hour

515
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,063
and this is the line for appointments

516
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,000
someone stole my license plates,and now

517
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,868
I got to be here and deal with this mess

518
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:03,108
why would someone steal your place

519
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:04,432
personalized place

520
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,039
don't nvu

521
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:09,001
get it?

522
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,214
that's good

523
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:12,047
my place the bomb

524
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:13,280
that's you

525
00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:14,633
you better watch it

526
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:16,547
those will be gone,before you know it

527
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,799
Sammo Law

528
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,811
right here

529
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,087
what do you need?

530
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,899
to get my driver's license

531
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:25,064
baby,I know that already

532
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:27,476
you're gonna have to be a little more specific

533
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,000
I need to take the driver's test again

534
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
uh-huh

535
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:33,908
well,I got some bad news for you

536
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,677
you need to fill out this form

537
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,867
and this form

538
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,799
take the eye test,the written test

539
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,020
and then,take yourself over to window c

540
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:42,613
which is only open tuesdays

541
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:44,073
and thursdays from eight to four

542
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:45,354
have a good day,
next

543
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:46,454
wait,wait,wait

544
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,010
I have already done that

545
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,067
and

546
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,790
I don't mean to be trouble

547
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:55,002
you're so sweet

548
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,088
let me check something

549
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:01,139
whoa

550
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:03,002
it's the weapons

551
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,039
and don't make me use them

552
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,322
okay,look,you failed your driver's test

553
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:10,902
you're gonna have to start all over

554
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,080
you have beautiful eyes like black pearls

555
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
stunning

556
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,009
are you trying to butter me up?

557
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,657
no,I'm just telling the truth

558
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,041
it's thursday afternoon okay for your drivers test

559
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
perfect

560
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
next

561
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,029
Sommerset and Cooper got taken down by the cops

562
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:11,219
if you know anything about prisoner of war mentality,
Mr. lasalle

563
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,304
you'd know that

564
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:13,405
a soldier won't crack

565
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,605
as long as he's got something to live for

566
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:17,894
my call is those two guys are looking for their back end

567
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:23,376
do they know about me,Fallon

568
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,089
they're on a strictly need-to-know basis

569
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,057
well,good,cause,I'm out

570
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
that's a shame,because

571
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:33,491
the movement still needs funds

572
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,133
taking down these trucks is getting too damn risky

573
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,900
I mean,sooner or later

574
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:39,611
these cops are gonna play connect the dots

575
00:27:39,612 --> 00:27:40,818
and when they do

576
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:43,108
it's gonna point right back to me

577
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,099
all right

578
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,028
it is too risky

579
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,023
taking down those trucks one at a time

580
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,281
so,it's time to implement a new strategy

581
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,932
you are looking for something

582
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,100
look for Andy?

583
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:16,290
nope,nothing

584
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
yeah

585
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:19,777
he said,he was working on a hunch

586
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,119
he had about this case

587
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
lieutenant

588
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:24,833
I talked to some of andy's friends

589
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,099
you know,after his wife died

590
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:29,075
andy dropped Kristen off at his sister's

591
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:31,654
and disappeared on a three-day gambling binge

592
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,043
no...no...no

593
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,732
he said,he was all through with that

594
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:36,333
maybe,he fell off the wagon

595
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:39,044
yeah,well,if you hear anything

596
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,002
you just give me a call,I'll be at home

597
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:42,009
okay

598
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,081
children can sense when things are wrong

599
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,041
that is why she cannot sleep

600
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,104
you know,I tried reading to her

601
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:56,404
but,it didn't work

602
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,032
let me try

603
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,218
hello,Kristen

604
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:13,336
where are you?

605
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,660
I'm Sammo

606
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,800
Sammo,when is daddy coming back

607
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,289
we hope soon

608
00:29:21,783 --> 00:29:23,006
I miss him

609
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
no

610
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,663
when I was a boy in china

611
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,409
my mother used to sing a song to me

612
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,520
when I couldn't sleep

613
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,765
what kind?

614
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,820
a lullaby

615
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,900
would you like to be saying to you?

616
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,049
Kristen,you must eat

617
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,012
I'm not hungry

618
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,059
but,it is breakfast of champions

619
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,292
what that is?

620
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:36,144
open it

621
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,099
for dory to protect her

622
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,900
on a rainy day

623
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,040
thank you,Sammo

624
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,739
and when daddy gets back,can we show him

625
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:59,000
only if you finish your breakfast

626
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,021
I picked up Bobby Lee Sommerset's wife

627
00:31:10,022 --> 00:31:13,163
seems Mrs. Sommerset is less than blissfully married

628
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:14,604
Louis is interrogating her,now

629
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:15,799
keep me posted

630
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,806
sure thing

631
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,100
that's him

632
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,103
I told him not to get involved with that crew

633
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,040
they weren't gonna look out for him

634
00:31:24,002 --> 00:31:27,062
can you id any of the other members?

635
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,087
just the leader

636
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:32,604
a guy called Fallon

637
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,189
Bobby Lee hooked up with him at the gun club in the valley

638
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,077
Luther Fallon

639
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,144
lapd

640
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,567
what can I do for you?

641
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:52,476
that's a nice tattoo

642
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,687
are you a member of the liberty republic?

643
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:58,009
well,having a political point of view isn't a crime,is it?

644
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,066
no

645
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,070
but,blowing up churches and synagogues is

646
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,034
you just here to hassle me,officers

647
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:10,177
investigating a homicide in a series of armored car robberies

648
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,639
where were you monday morning?

649
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,063
I was home in idaho

650
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:14,087
really

651
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:15,219
yeah,really

652
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:18,509
church meeting went a little late sunday night

653
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,889
got up early monday morning did some farm chores

654
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,256
so,then,what are you doing here in los angeles

655
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,060
I go back and forth quite a bit

656
00:32:25,063 --> 00:32:26,362
self-threshing equipment

657
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:27,555
threshing equipment

658
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:28,566
yeah

659
00:32:28,576 --> 00:32:29,775
wow,I didn't know

660
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:32,675
there was such a big demand for threshing equipment in l.a

661
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:36,110
hey,guys,I'm just trying to cooperate,right?

662
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,328
is that a fact?

663
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,650
well,you know what

664
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:41,319
we think,you're trying to finance your own little revolution,Fallon

665
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,520
hey,maybe,

666
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:45,722
you want to move the nation's capital to hadley idaho

667
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,520
no brother

668
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,810
I just want to keep america pure

669
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,299
send people like her back to their own country

670
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,163
that's funny

671
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,700
you don't look native american

672
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,319
where should we send you?

673
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
hey

674
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,020
I know exactly,where I'm gonna send you

675
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:06,369
yeah

676
00:33:06,393 --> 00:33:07,393
yeah

677
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,210
we'll be seeing you soon

678
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,232
let's go,grace

679
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,076
fellain's alibi checked out,check the airlines

680
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:21,277
there is no way

681
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:23,837
he could have made it back and forth from idaho to la

682
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,399
based on those flight schedules

683
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,689
shoot,I don't believe it

684
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,150
all right,keep up surveillance of the army truck routes

685
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:30,472
and let's isolate the ones

686
00:33:30,473 --> 00:33:32,072
that we think may be vulnerable

687
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,311
where's Sammo?

688
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,531
babysitting

689
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:38,190
you know,lieutenant,fandy doesn't show up soon

690
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:40,159
we're gonna have to turn Kristen over to child welfare

691
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,572
I'm aware of that,Louis

692
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,299
let's just give the man to the end of the day,why don't we?

693
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,488
what is your science budget

694
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,679
we have the choice

695
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:54,143
of growing a seed

696
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,075
showing how the solar system works

697
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,009
or building a volcano

698
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,087
volcano is the shoe thing

699
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,033
yeah,but,that's the toughest one

700
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,000
toughest project

701
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,091
will bring you the best grade

702
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:11,086
but,my dad comes to do it with me

703
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,703
we will do it together

704
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,834
you know,how to build a volcano

705
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,523
when I was a boy in china

706
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,080
we will talk the learning comes from a challenge

707
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,999
you don't know anything about building a volcano

708
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,002
do you?

709
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,010
not witty

710
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:40,023
just like my dad

711
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
let's lock and load no questions in the field,gentlemen

712
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:50,921
so,if you've got him ask him,now

713
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,965
what about him?

714
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,006
we keep him for insurance till the mission's complete

715
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:56,412
now,let's get it home

716
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
hi

717
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:10,024
we want to build a volcano

718
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,060
this big

719
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:14,111
this big

720
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,036
we need a chicken wire

721
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:18,539
alley

722
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,499
plaster of paris

723
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:21,590
aisle for

724
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:22,611

thank you

727
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,021
did I mention my search project is due,tomorrow?

728
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,019
then,we will complete it,tonight

729

I will complete it tonight

732
00:35:42,134 --> 00:35:46,023
last year,jimmy slater's mom built some tornado

733
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:48,000
and he got first place

734
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,000

735
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,132

00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,060

762
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,398
are you okay?

763
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
yeah

764
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,998
also,we need a wire cutter

765
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,067
and a big roll of brown paper

766
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,080
don't forget the baking soda to make the volcano sizzle

767
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,199
and baking soda for sizzle

768
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,111
hey,Louis,

769
00:38:19,112 --> 00:38:21,513
we just had an alarm case security,
hit another armored truck?

770
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:22,794
nope,main depot

771
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:23,799
got to go

772
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,901
let's go

773
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,970
yeah!ready see a sign

774
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,599
while we were monitoring the truck routes

775
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,111
they went for the mother lode

776
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,000
yeah,looks like they double crossed

777
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,799
their inside man on his own turf

778
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,223
like himself

779
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:52,023
we got to find that guy

780
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,207
there's got to be a way to crack Fallon's alibi

781
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,685
lieutenant,there's got to be a way

782
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,999
how he's got a whole church congregation lined up in hadley

783
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,289
just waiting to say

784
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,089
he was there sunday night and monday morning

785
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,646
his minister even called me

786
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:13,135
and bent my ear about what a filler the community is

787
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,099
fallon's robbed a lot of trucks

788
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,900
it's made a lot of money

789
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,100
maybe,

790
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,218
maybe,they bought their own plane

791
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:23,041
I'll check plane registrations in idaho

792
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,200
a good idea

793
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:26,585
hey,where's samo?

794
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,829
dmv test

795
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,065
you again

796
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,900
I'm ready to prove to you

797
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:42,100
I can be a california driver,sir

798
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,701
drive on

799
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,218
yeah,yeah,

800
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:54,451
lieutenant,we got it

801
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:55,452
yeah

802
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,907
Fallon's got his own g3

803
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:58,474
we checked flight records

804
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:00,788
his plane took off from hadley at 5 15 a.m monday

805
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,999
landed at van nuys at 7 33 am

806
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,800
giving him plenty of time to pull the heist

807
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,601
hey,did he finally return flight plan

808
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:08,401
yes,he did!lose van nuys in a half hour

809
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:09,635
not if we can help

810
00:40:09,636 --> 00:40:10,826
but,let's get out there

811
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,476
You drive too fast

812
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,098
man,I'm going to get my license

813
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,566
I think,we can safely say that

814
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:19,746
hold on!excuse me

815
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,003
yes,Louis

816
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,008
where?

817
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,800
sorry for this business

818
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,429
where are we begining?

819
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,379
all right,man,

820
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,000
let's get this bird in the air

821
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Fallon

822
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,094
wanna dump them now

823
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:50,428
get rid of them later

824
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,930
I'm out over salt lake city

825
00:40:57,023 --> 00:40:58,155
come on,get him

826
00:40:58,279 --> 00:40:59,388
get him

827
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:00,666
Andy,get down

828
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,600
Andy,come on,come on

829
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,000
some guy's blocking the runway

830
00:41:37,478 --> 00:41:38,578
get him

831
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,069
oh,god

832
00:42:13,193 --> 00:42:14,193
Freeze!

833
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,359
I realized that all the companies

834
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,993
that were robbed all belong to the same security association

835
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
which means

836
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:48,801
they all submit bids to the same clients

837
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:51,002
right,so,an insider one company would have

838
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:52,590
knowledge of the other company's roots

839
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,960
how did you peg this out?

840
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:55,938
it was our company's rep to the association

841
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,637
so,I figured it was worth a shot,wow!

842
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:01,283
it's a great job,Andy thanks a lot,nice work

843
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:02,606
hey,look,I don't know

844
00:43:02,607 --> 00:43:04,007
if you're still interested enough

845
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:05,785
but,I could put in a call in long beach

846
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:07,518
