你们的卡车开到我家

The men are packing all my things, private things.

117
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,659

And I make every payment until the sickness took my eye.

123

I hope to have more money soon. I just need a little more time. You...

124
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,596
我觉得经理可能不会同意您的延期要求
I don't think my manager's going to extend you any more credit.

125
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,862
求求你  帮我问下
Please. Won't you try?

We have an elderly woman asking for an extension on her mortgage payment.

She's on a fixed income, and she's had some medical problems.

130
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,788
我们应该帮帮她
There's gotta be something we can do to help her.

131
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,873
显然  我们已经为她延期了两次
Well, apparently, we've already granted her two extensions.

132
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,942
这类丧失抵押物  我们要收回固定资产
And, you know, on this type of foreclosure, we seize the trapped equity

133
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,480
银行要支出很大一笔费用
And the bank makes a sizable amount in fees.

134
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,777
我们会让她无家可归
We would have to throw her out of her house.

135
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,579
这是个棘手问题
It's a tough decision.

136
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,252
你看着办吧
Your call.

137
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,275
我会妥善处理的
I'll take care of it.

138
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,438
加纳什夫人  很抱歉
Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

139
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,303
我们不能再提供延期还贷了
But another extension on the loan is out of the question.

140
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,866
-你说什么  -我希望能帮上忙  但是银行的规定
- What? - I would like to help, but it is in the bank's...

141
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,381
不  求求你  这是我的家  以后我住哪里
No, please, this is my home. Where will I live?

142
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,447
您有提到您孙女  或许您可能和她一起住
You list your granddaughter as a reference. Maybe you could stay with her.

143
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,145
我不想给她增加负担
I would not burden her.

144
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,318
还有一些设施很好的老人院
And there are several fine assisted living facilities for the elderly...

145
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:51,227
疗养院吗  我可不住那些地方
A nursing home? No, I would never live in one of those places.

146
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,994
实在很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

147
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,523
我是个有自尊心的女人  布朗小姐
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

148
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,864
从来没求过人
And never have I begged for anything.

149
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,265
但现在  我求求你
But now, I beg for you.

150
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,103
-我向你跪下了  -加纳什夫人  请别这样
- I humble myself before you. - Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.

151
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,869
-请站起来说  -我西尔维亚・加纳什  求求你
- Please stand up. - I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

152
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,935
以我母亲的名义  求求你
On my mother's grave, I beg you!

153
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,212
请松手  保安  别这样
Please let go. Let go! Security! Stop!

154
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,052
-那边  比利  -来啦
- Over here, Billy! Over here! - We're coming.

155
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,963
你羞辱我
You shame me.

156
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:13,239
我求你  你却羞辱我
I beg you, and you shame me.

157
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,741
夫人  您的业务办理完毕了吧
I think your business is finished here, ma'am.

158
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,916
走吧
Let's go.

159
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,418
加纳什夫人
Mrs Ganush...

160
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,324
快出去
Get out of here!

161
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,595
-过来  夫人  -走吧
- Come on, ma'am. - Let's go.

162
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,743
从没见过这样的人
I never saw anything quite like that before.

163
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,906
你没事吧
Are you okay?

164
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,343
你处理的很好
You handled that just right, you know.

165
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,929
-晚安  明天见  -好的
- Good night. See you tomorrow. - Okay.

166
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,269
我刚看完这份麦克弗森的贷款
You know, I just finished going over this McPherson loan.

167
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,775
-你做得不错  -谢谢
- This is very impressive work. - Thanks.

168
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,312
你能不能今晚带回去做完
Would you mind taking this home tonight and finishing it up?

169
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,645
因为我想明天一早就给区域副总过目
Because I would like to show it to the regional veep in the morning.

170
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,514
-我很乐意  -那太好了
- I would love to. - Great.

171
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,984
谢谢
Thank you.

172
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,546
目前副经理的人选
And as far as that assistant manager's position goes,

173
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,623
你已经是首选了
You're at the top of the list.

174
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,342
你羞辱了我
You shamed me.

175
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,962
我赢啦   你个死老太婆
I beat you, you old bitch!

176
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,826
不
No!

177
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,789
女妖
Lamia.

178
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,307
很快  就换成你来求我了
Soon it will be you who comes begging to me.

179
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,674
-她就在那  -谢谢
- She's right over there. - Thank you, thank you.

180
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,316
他们派了警察去找她谈话
Once they send some officers over to have a talk with her,

181
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,689
以后她就不会来烦你了  知道吗
she's not gonna be bothering you any more, okay?

182
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,251
你就别再想了
So don't even think about her.

183
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,887
我会给杰克斯先生打电话
And I'm gonna call Mr Jacks and just make sure

184
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,159
确保他能每晚安排保安送你上车  好吗
He can have somebody walk you to your car every night, okay?

185
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,495
好的
Okay.

186
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,835
你没事  真是谢天谢地  你没事  对吧
I just thank God you're okay. You are okay, right?

187
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,935
我没事
I'm fine.

188
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,608
怎么了  有什么事吗
What? What's the matter?

189
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:05,409
或许我应该给她办理延期还款的
It's just that maybe I could have gotten her another extension on her loan.

190
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,882
克莉丝  别这么做
Chris, no, don't do that.

191
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,115
你说过银行已经为她延期了两次  是吧
You said the bank granted this woman two extensions already, right?

192
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,281
那就对不起了  不按揭还款就得没收房子
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage, you lose your house.

193
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,053
那女人能指望什么  这不是你的错
What does this woman expect? It's not your fault.

194
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,687
你不必自责
You can't beat yourself up over it.

195
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,401
我是说那女人能指望什么  这不是你的错
I mean, what'd she expect? It's not your fault.

196
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:30,636
不管你能做或不能做
And regardless of what you may or may not have been able to do,

197
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,538
她都没有正当的理由
That's still no justification for her...

198
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,050
这是什么  怎么啦
What is it? What's wrong?

199
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,559
-你听到了吗  -听到什么
- Did you hear that? - What?

200
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,483
真的吗  你没听到吗
Really? You didn't?

201
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,657
没有  什么声音
No. What?

202
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,165
我知道可能感觉会比较怪  但是我想算一卦
I know this is gonna sound weird, but I wanna get my fortune read.

203
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,176
现在吗  你不是开玩笑吧
Now? Are you kidding?

204
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,678
算了吧  克莉丝  我来帮你算吧
Come on, Chris. I'll read your fortune for you.

205
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,173
在不久的将来  我们一起坐车
In the near future, we are gonna get in the car,

206
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,185
-然后回家放松  -克莱  我真的很想算命
- Go home and relax. - Clay, I really want to do this.

207
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,017
为什么  因为那个老女人吗
Why? Because of what happened with that old woman?

208
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,422
克莉丝  我想现在该送你回家了
Chris, I really think we should just get you home now.

209
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,787
你能陪我吗
Can you do this for me?

210
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,538
但愿我的学生不会看见我来
I pray to God none of my students see me here.

211
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,273
那样我唯一能教的班级  就只有  比如伪善101
The only class I'll be able to teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.

212
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,107
这里有很多选择
Yeah, there's so many things to choose from here.

213
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,278
不幸的是  并不是我要找的
Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,

214
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,778
比如怪异的干猴子的小脑袋
Which is a weird little dried monkey head.

215
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,048
等等  没关系  他有一个
Wait, no, never mind, he's got one.

216
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,058
我叫拉姆・加斯  是个预言者
I am Rham Jas, seer.

217
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:01,730
-我叫克莉丝汀  这位是克莱  -或许你已经知道了  是吧
- I'm Christine and this is Clay. -But you probably already knew that, right?

218
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:06,337
-开个玩笑  -我能帮你什么忙吗
- Just kidding. -How can I help you?

219
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:10,000
我想占卜一下自己的命运  可以吗
I would like to have my fortune read. Can you do that?

220
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,135
我能看到某些能量
I have the ability to see certain energies.

221
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,840
有时  这些能量就是事物的前兆
Sometimes these energies are a foretoken of things to come.

222
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,177
请支付60美元
$60, please.

223
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,013
-真的假的  -当然
- Seriously? - Yes.

224
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,748
60美元  这个开价是不是太高了
Sixty... Doesn't that seem a little steep for this sort of thing?

225
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:28,657
-如果你不是诚心诚意  请回吧  -那好  走吧  克莉丝
- If you're not serious, please go. -All right. Come on, Chris.

226
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,321
等等  我来付吧
Wait, wait! I'll... I'll pay.

227
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,593
不用  我来付吧
No, you know what? You know what? I got it. I got it.

228
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:39,431
-给  -白金卡  不错
- There you go. - Platinum card. Very good.

229
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,772
谢谢
Thank you.

230
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,745
-过来  亲爱的  -谢谢
-Here, here, baby. -Thanks.

231
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,041
应该的
Sure.

232
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,215
那边请
Uh-uh. Please.

233
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,110
好的
Okay.

234
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,723
你想了解自己的命运
So, you wish to know something of your destiny.

235
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:01,953
-是的  -非常好
- Yes. - Very good.

236
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,551
来看看店里的天意
Let's see what the fates have in store.

237
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,893
弗洛伊德曾说命运并不是天意的表现
You know, Freud said destiny was not an act of fate,

238
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,727
而是由我们潜意识产生
But rather something created by our subconscious

239
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,597
并控制我们有意识的选择
To control our conscious choices.

240
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:14,729
没错  不过我们不能单凭智力去认知世界
That's true. But we cannot attempt to understand the world by intellect alone.

241
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,136
-卡尔・荣格  -是的
- Carl Jung. - Yes.

242
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,870
出自他的论文  心理学形态
From his treatise Psychological Types.

243
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,380
-那么  -荣格  新时代人们最喜爱的心理学家
- So... - Jung, the New Agers' favourite psychologist.

244
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,747
因为他不怕把上帝拿到公式里讲
Because he wasn't afraid to bring God into the equation.

245
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,116
他不怕把上帝拿到...
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God into...

246
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,621
-克莱  别说了  -好的  我知道  开始吧
- Clay, Clay, come on. - Let's do it. I know. Come on. Let's start.

247
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,486
-可以开始了吗  -我已经准备好了
- Shall we?  - I'm ready.

248
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,252
很好  请把你的手给我
Very well. Please, give me your hand.

249
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,988
好的
Okay.

250
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:39,225
这样放  好的
This way. Okay.

251
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,494
你的工作和钱有关
You work with money.

252
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:49,899
没错
That's right.

253
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,609
最近你丢了东西
And you've recently lost something.

254
00:26:55,781 --> 00:27:01,242
-好像没有  -不  不  你还没丢
- No, I don't think so. - No. No, you haven't lost anything.

255
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,686
但是你有东西被人拿走
But something's been taken from you.

256
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:06,751
没有
No.

257
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,294
-一粒钮扣  -天哪  是的
- A button. - Oh, my God. Yes!

258
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,027
谁都看得出她少了粒钮扣  那又怎样
Well, anyone can see she's missing a button! So what?

259
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,360
但是  克莱  这的确很奇怪
But, Clay, it was really strange.

260
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,866
今天那个老女人  从我袖子上拿走了一粒钮扣
The old woman today, she took a button from my sleeve.

261
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,803
-她为什么要这么做  -你们两个能不能安静点
- Why would she do that? - If you would both please just be quiet!

262
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,608
-我想今晚差不多了  -怎么啦
- I think that's enough for tonight. - What's wrong?

263
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,244
我很累了  而且天色已晚
I'm tired, and I see it's become quite late.

264
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:42,244
当然  我会退钱给你
I will, of course, refund your money.

265
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,879
等等  你看到了什么吗
Wait, wait, wait! Did you see something?

266
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,085
一个恶灵缠上你了
A dark spirit has come upon you.

267
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,626
-什么意思  -他的意思是...
- What do you mean? - Well, he's...

268
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,593
你有去墓地亵渎死者吗
Did you blaspheme the dead while visiting a graveyard?

269
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,756
-没有  -你玩过占卜盘吗
- No! - Did you play with a Ouija board

270
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,696
或者和练习黑暗魔法的人有交往
Or consort with those who practise the black arts?

271
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,098
好了  别紧张  拜托
All right, take it easy, man. Come on.

272
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,227
等等  克莱  我都没有做过
Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay. No. No, I didn't.

273
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,133
或许有人对你下了诅咒
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

274
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,290
那他怎么会知道那些
Then how did he know all that? 

275
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,314
知道什么  你丢了钮扣吗
Know what? That you lost a button?

276
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,641
再说了  他并不是很了解
And by the way, he didn't really know that much.

277
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,653
他做了一些可能的猜测  然后
He makes a couple of good guesses, then he...

278
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,656
他说动你  然后给你一堆的问题
He stirs you up, and then he leaves you with all these questions

279
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,318
然后顺手递上自己的名片
And, conveniently, his business card.

280
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,486
克莉丝  他只是个江湖骗子
Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.

281
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,991
但是他没有要钱啊  他想退给我们  记得吗
But he didn't want the money. He tried to give it back, remember?

282
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,832
其实他在装  最后还不是收了  是吧
Well, he sort of tried, but in the end, he took it, didn't he?

283
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,331
可能吧
I guess so.

284
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,595
我要去找拖你车的人
I gotta go meet the guy that's towing your car,

285
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,690
你会没事吧
So you gonna be okay?

286
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,099
-是的  -那就好  猫咪要好好照顾她哦
- Yeah. - All right. Kitty, take care of her.

287
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,865
-一小时后见  我爱你  -好的
- I'll see you in about an hour. Love you. - Okay.

288
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,200
好的
Okay.

289
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,096
-给  放在嘴唇上  -谢谢
- Here. Put that on your lip. - Thank you.

290
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,673
真不敢相信她竟然到家里来了
I can't believe she came to the house.

291
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:02,673
这太疯狂了  我要报警
This is so nuts. I'm calling the cops.

292
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,902
-不是她干的  -那会是谁
- It wasn't her. - Who was it then?

293
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,508
我不知道  看不清是什么
I don't know. I couldn't see who it was.

294
00:34:07,508 --> 00:34:09,208
一定是她  肯定是她
Of course it was her. It had to be her.

295
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,215
不要  克莱  谁都不是
No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!

296
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,444
肯定是某个人  克莉丝  一定是某个人
It was somebody. Chris, it had to be somebody.

297
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,018
灯灭了  你看不清楚是谁罢了
The lights were out. You just couldn't see who it was,

298
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,283
-但我猜是  -克莱  当时根本没人
- But I'm guessing it was... - Clay, there wasn't anybody here.

299
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,853
那会是谁干的
Then who did this?

300
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,023
谁打你的脸了
Who hit you in the face?

301
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,370
我认为是今天早前受袭击的一个反应
I think it's just a reaction to her being attacked earlier in the day.

302
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,963
是的  外伤后压力的典型症状
Yeah. Classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

303
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,475
是的  她有恐慌和惊吓症状  所以...
Yeah, she's showing signs of panic and paranoia. so...

304
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,046
不  不  不  我没事
No, no, no, I'll be fine.

305
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,479
好的
All right.

306
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,309
嗨  嗨
Hey, hey.

307
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,117
现在感觉怎么样了
How you doing?

308
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,383
-好多了  -是吗
-Better. -Yeah?

309
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,550
多亏医生的开导
Especially after the doctor explained it to me.

310
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,594
他说在暴力受害者身上
He said that victims of violence,

311
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,130
-偶尔会发生...-发生悲剧再现
- They re-experience... - Re-experience their trauma.

312
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,899
我错以为是什么更严重的事
I misinterpreted it to be something more than it was.

313
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:08,328
-碰巧罢了  -我只是...感觉...
- Happens. - I just... I feel...

314
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,408
-怎么了  -有点难堪
- What? - Kind of embarrassed.

315
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,729
别开玩笑了
Are you kidding?

316
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,241
跟我在一块儿还有什么好难堪的
No. You never have to be embarrassed with me.

317
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,844
记住了
Okay?

318
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:28,148
嗨  要不周六出去旅旅游散散心  怎么样
Hey, listen, I was thinking maybe we could take a little trip on Saturday,

319
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,023
-坐火车去圣巴巴拉  -你的乡村木屋
- Get on the train and go to Santa barbara. - Your folks' cabin.

320
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,527
是啊  如果你想去
Yeah, if you're up for it, the cabin.

321
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,928
-天呢  我当然愿意去  -真的  好极了
- Oh, my god, I would love to! - Yeah? Good.

- That'd be so exciting. - Baby, you're gonna love it.

323
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,459
-你肯定喜欢的  -好的
- You're gonna love it. - Okay, good.

324
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,594
我一直打算让你去瞧瞧呢
I'm excited for you to see it.

325
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,262
-那些树 还都是私人的  -那真是太好了
- These trees and it's private. - That would be great.

326
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,863
肯定会很好玩
It'll be great. It'll be good.

327
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:48,378
我们可以可以...  我们可以聊天什么的
I think we need to. and we can just... We can just talk and stuff.

328
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,503
怎么了
What?

329
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,846
-怎么了  -我有点...有点头昏脑胀
- What's the matter? - I couldn't... I couldn't wake up.

330
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:08,184
没事的  过来  那只是一个梦罢了
It's okay. Okay. Come here. It was just a dream.

331
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,595
宝贝  租的车停在那边
Baby, that's the rental car they dropped off this morning.

332
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,328

Hey, baby, try not to piss off any old ladies today, okay?

335
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,554
海  克莉丝汀

336
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,500
-什么事  你刚来吗  -怎么了  你又不是考勤员
- What, are you just getting here? - What are you, the hall monitor?

337
00:38:57,569 --> 00:38:59,901
克莉丝汀  你太幽默了
Ha, ha. Very funny, Christine.

338
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,365
这是什么
What's this?

339
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,668
你要干嘛
What do you want?

340
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,007
我想让你再教教我关于贷款手续
I need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures.

341
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,849
我现在有点心烦   能不能明天着
I've got a lot on my mind. Can we do this tomorrow?

342

-当然  -好的
- Sure. - Okay.

343
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,516
我就告诉杰克斯先生你现在没空就是了
I'll just tell Mr Jacks that you don't have the time right now.

344
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:19,921
-也许他可以告诉我  -不  不  我来吧
- Maybe he can tell me. - No, no! Okay, I'll do it.

345
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:21,687
好的
Okay.

346
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:26,192
我们之前看到抵押贷款须知
We were going over the asset-based lending guidelines.

347
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:26,561
是
Right.

348
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:28,635
我们假设你的客户是一家公司
Let's say your client is a company

349
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:31,258
但通过传统方式得不到银行资助
That can't get traditional bank financing.

350
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,777
-并且  -并且...

-我来帮你  -不用 不用  我自己能行
- Let me help you. - No, no, I've got it under control.

358
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,975
天啊  天啊
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

359

有没有溅到我嘴里
Did I get any in my mouth? 

363
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:32,992
我带您到那边清理一下吧
Let me take you over here to get clean.

364
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,430
实在对不起  天啊
I'm so sorry! Oh, my god!

365
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,163

有事吗
What is it?

368
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,892
你好  我来找西尔维亚・加纳什  她在吗
Hi. I came to see Sylvia ganush. Is she here?

369
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,025
你是谁
Who are you?

370
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,498
我是她的一个朋友

371
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,903
-一个...  -等一下
- Someone... - Wait.

372
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:58,746
我知道你是谁了  奶奶告诉过我你会来
I know who you are. Grandma told me you would come.

373
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:02,350
你就是银行那个夺走她房子的
You are the woman from the bank, the one who took her house.

374
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,183
事实上  是银行拿走了房子
Actually, it was the bank that took the house.

375
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,416
我是说  我只负责在那工作
I mean, I just work there.

376

In fact, I tried to help your grandma get the house back,

377
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,919
但老板就是不同意
But my boss wouldn't let me.

378
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,761
你就这样站在我门口跟我撒谎
Are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face?

379
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:25,775
-没有  -你以前很胖  是不是
- No. - You used to be a real fat girl, didn't you?

380
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,577
-是的  -我能看出来
- Yeah. - I can tell.

381
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,554
我们不欢迎你来这
You are not welcome here.

382
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,290
等等  我想见见她
Wait! wait. I need to see her.

I need her to forgive me. And I'll get her the house back.

384
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,564
你会帮她摆平一切  是吗
And you are gonna make everything all right for her, is that it?

385
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:48,792
是的
Yes.

386
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,633

-把她移开  把她移开  -快  别看
- Get her off me! Get her off me! - Come! Don't look.

00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,301
-抓住她的肩膀  -用点力  把她举起来
- Grab her shoulder. - Be a man! Lift her up!

390
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,217

还要帮她摆平吗
Still going to make everything all right for her?

392
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,688
你活该
You deserve everything that is coming to you.

393
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,231
-再来一次
- One more time!

394
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,834
我相信折磨你的是个女妖
I believe what plagues you is the lamia.

395
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,174
女妖  那个老女人就是这么喊的
Lamia, that's the word the old woman used.

396
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:45,238
这个恶魔  只听吉普赛人的召唤做坏事
The black goat, only summoned by gypsies for their darkest deeds.

397
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,556
头三天
For the first three days,

398
00:44:47,556 --> 00:44:51,511
女妖以凶灵的形象出现  慢慢折磨你
The lamia appears as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.

399
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:54,524
然后  她会把你的灵魂带走
After that, it reveals itself to be a taker of souls,

400
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:57,026
她会来找那个被诅咒物的所有者
And it comes for the owner of the accursed object.

401
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,584
被诅咒物  什么东西
Accursed object. What object?

402
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,097
从受害者身上拿的东西  下咒后  又还回的
Something taken from the victim, cursed and given back.

403
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,400
这个
This?

404
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,768
我把它烧了呢
What if I just burn it?

405
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,934
不管这个扣子怎么样
I'm afraid no matter what condition the button is in,

406
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,937
你还是所有者  女妖同样会来带你走
You would still be the owner. The lamia would still come to take you.

407
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,743
带我去哪
Take me where?

408
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:30,723
-我怎么才能避免  -你可以试着安抚她
- Then how do I get rid of this? - You could attempt to appease the spirit.

409
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,729
最简单的方式就是供奉血淋淋的祭品
The simplest way would be a blood offering.

410
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:36,733
可以用一些小动物  或者鸡也行
A small creature could be sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.

411
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,894
不行  听着  我是一个素食主义者
No way! Look, I'm a vegetarian.

412
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,905
天呢  我还在动物保护所当志愿者
I volunteer at the puppy shelter, for christ's sake.

413
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:44,066
我是不会杀生的
I don't go around killing animals.

414
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,075
到时候你就知道你会不会了
You will be surprised what you'll be willing to do

415
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,304
当女妖找上门时
When the lamia comes for you.

416
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,639
这本书可以教你怎么做
This will show you how.

417
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:58,656
过来  猫咪  猫咪
Here, kitty, kitty.

418
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,048
克莉丝  克莉丝
Chris! Chris?

419
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:24,983
克莉丝
Chris?

420
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,591
嗨  你在这啊  你在这干嘛呢
Hey, there you are. What are you doing out here?

421
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,354
宝贝  我打电话到银行  他们说你早走了
Baby, I called the bank. They said you left early.

422
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,920
你也没接我电话  那是血吗
You're not answering my calls. Is that blood?

423
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,330
不是  怎么会有血呢
No. why would there be blood?

424
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,373
是啊  宝贝  那...那有血  在你袖子上
Yeah, baby, there's... there's blood on your sleeve.

425
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,499
-你在流血吗  -没有
- Are you bleeding? - No.

426
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,370
那只是番茄汁
It was just tomato juice.

427
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,274
我刚才在切番茄
I was cutting a tomato in the

428
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:52,177
可能一不小心溅上来了
Kitchen and it must have gotten on my sleeve.

429
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:58,587
克莉丝  要不我们改天吃晚饭吧
Hey, chris, why don't we do this dinner another time?

430
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,118
你这几天过的太难了  我觉得是最好还是
You've had a rough couple of days. I think it's better.

431
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,285
没事  我想去
No, I want to go to the dinner.

432
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,728
我知道  但是你确定你没事吗
I know, but are you sure you're feeling all right?

433
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,865
说实话  过去几天确实不顺
Honestly, I haven't been.

434
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,700
但是我觉得...
But I think...

435
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,945
我现在觉得一切都好了
I think that everything is gonna be okay now.

436
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:26,409
真的
I really do.

437
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,949
怎么样
What do you think?

438
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,323
你看起来太漂亮了
You look beautiful.

439
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:45,062
真的  天啊
It really is. My god.

440
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,399
里面也很漂亮
It's gonna be nice inside, too.

441
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:51,974
他们会喜欢你的
They're gonna love you.

442
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,337
-克莱顿  -妈妈
- Clayton. - Hello, mother.

443
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,675
见到你真高兴  这是克莉丝汀
Good to see you. This is Christine.

444
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,772
-这是我母亲  特鲁迪  -你好  克莉丝汀
- That's my mom, Trudy. - Hello, Christine.

445
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,943
你好  很高心见到你
Hello. It's very nice to meet you.

446
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,754
-哦  -请进  请进
- Well. - Please, come in. Come in.

447
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:05,914
好
Yes.

448
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,619
-老爸  最近过的怎么样  -嗨  儿子
- Hey, Dad, how are you? - Hey, son.

449
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,420
伯父  很高兴见到您
Good to see you, sir.

450
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,256
这是克莉丝汀  这是我爸爸  莱昂纳德
This is Christine. Christine, this is my dad, Leonard.

451
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,420
-你好  -嗨 玛丽娅  谢谢
- Nice to meet you. - Hi, Maria. Thank you.

452
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:16,091
-你们家真漂亮  -谢谢
- You have a beautiful home. - Well, thank you very much.

453
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,425
-你要不要喝点什么  -要酒吗?
- Can I get you a drink? - Yeah, wine?

454
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,867
-你们要吗  -当然
- Do you guys want? - Sure.

455
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,770
-好的  过来帮我  -我一会回来
- Okay. Come help me. - I'll be right back.

456
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,666
好的  亲爱的
Yes, dear.

457
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,307
-希望你不要太介意  -太客气了
- I hope you don't mind. - How thoughtful.

458
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:32,042
-自己做的  -是的
- Homemade? - Yes.

459
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,947
你们管这种蛋糕叫什么
And what type of cake would you call that?

460
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,010
我们叫它
It's called

461
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:39,450
丰收蛋糕
A harvest cake.

462
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,617
你们是不是在农场上经常做啊
Is that something you would make on a farm?

463
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,721
不
No.

464
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:52,630
现在不了  我们过去还有一群鹅时常做
I mean, not any more. We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.

465
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:55,365
-鹅?  -就是在快到收获季节的时候
- Geese? - Well, right around the harvest time,

466
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,566
也就是下鹅蛋时
That's when your goose eggs will make a real dense yolk.

467
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:01,134
鹅蛋黄可以用来做大蛋糕
It makes for a rich cake.

468
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,382
哦  非常感谢
Well, just thank you.

469
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,715
-我们来了  -对不起打断你们的谈话
- Here we are. - Sorry to interrupt the bonding sesh.

470
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,013
-到宴厅来吧  -好的
- Why don't you join us in the dining room? - Good.

471
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:12,817
-好  我们走  就在那边  -好的
- Yeah, let's go. It's right in here. - Okay.

472
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,916
-天啊  -赫库巴
- Jeez. - Hecuba.

473
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,589
我从来就不了解那只该死的猫  我讨厌猫
I never did understand that damned animal. I hate cats.

474
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:23,326
真奇怪  赫库巴通常很乖的
That is so strange. Hecuba is usually very sweet.

475
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,233
没关系  我也曾有只猫  我能理解
That's okay. I had a cat. I understand.

476
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,395
你是说...你是说你现在养的那只猫吧
You mean... you mean you have a cat.

477
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,005
什么意思  那只猫怎么了
What do you mean? Did something happen?

478
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:34,101
是不是发生什么事了
Unless something happened to him.

479
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,941
我怎么会知道呢
Well, how am I supposed to know?

480
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,512
我是说  你也知道  猫总喜欢跑来跑去
I mean, you know how cats are. They come and they go.

481
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,180
是啊
That's true.

482
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,461
-你要不要...  -哦...是的  谢谢
- Well, should... - Well... yes. Yes, please.

483
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,460
儿子  古币收集的怎么样了
So, how's the coin collection, son?

484
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,433
我老爸通常会问"你还是个收集狂"
That's my dad's way of saying, "so, you're still a huge nerd?"

485
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,867
还好  事实上  克莉丝汀刚刚给我了一个
It's good. It's good. In fact, Christine just got me

486
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,906
1929年纪念自由女神站立像的硬币呢
A 1929 standing liberty quarter at her bank.

487
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,032
-真的吗  -太不可思议了吧  那硬币很少见
- Really? - Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.

488
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:08,408
我猜当一名银行出纳员肯定很难了
I just think the job of a bank teller must be so difficult,

489
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:12,142
天天计算  重复  肯定很烦人
With all that counting and repetition. It must get very tedious.

490
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,443
是的  你说的对
Yes, you're right,

491
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,714
-但我不是出纳员  -哦
- But I'm not a teller. - Oh?

492
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,583
是啊  妈妈  我告诉过你  克莉丝汀是放贷人
Yeah, mom, I told you. Christine's a loan officer.

493
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,987
她们银行所有小型经商和家庭贷款都归她管
She handles all the loans for small businesses and homes for her bank.

494
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,618
而且她最近要提升了  所以...对吗  克莉丝
And she's up for this big promotion, so... right, Chris?

495
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,934
如果我能把手头处理的一笔贷款业务结清了
If I could close this one account that I'm working on,

496
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:27,891
说不定就可以得到提拔了
It would really help.

497
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,058
那笔贷款肯定很重要
That must be a very important loan.

498
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:32,967
是啊  那是我们银行处理过的最大数目的
It's the biggest that my branch has ever handled.

499
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,231
你怎么接手这笔贷款的
And how did that come to you?

500
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,733
哦  我当时在读华尔街报
Well, I was reading the wall street journal

501
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:40,106
看到这家药材供应公司
And came across this medical supply company

502
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,613
打算扩张  但是没有足够的流动资金
That was looking to expand but didn't have the liquidity.

503
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,581
所以我就去见了他们总裁  提出了一套方案
So I met with their CEO and presented a formula

504
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,414
来帮助他们申请长期贷款
For restructuring some of their long-term debt.

505
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:52,080
克莉丝汀  看来你做的不错啊
Sounds like you've got a lot going for you, Christine.

506
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:55,023
你母亲肯定会为你感到自豪
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.

507
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,658
可能吧
I suppose.

508
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,601
我不太经常跟我妈妈见面
I don't see much of my mother.

509
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,865
-为什么  -哦  妈妈  那...那是人家的私事
- Why is that? - Wow, mom, that's... it's kind of personal.

510
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,030
我在跟克莉丝汀说话
I'm speaking to Christine.

511
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:18,645
自从我爸爸去世后  她就不怎么爱说话了
Well, ever since my dad died, she doesn't talk much.

512
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:25,487
一直待在农场上  自娱自乐  沉醉于...
She just stays on the farm and keeps to herself because...

513
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,291
沉醉于什么
Because?

514
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:32,124
因为她丈夫去世了  妈妈  所以她想一个人过
Because her husband died, mom, and she just wants to be by herself.

515
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:35,290
-为什么不...  -因为我妈妈嗜酒如命
- Why don't... - Because my mother's an alcoholic.

516
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,024
哦
Oh.

517
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,026
对不起
I'm sorry.

518
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,802
这也不是什么丢人的事
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

519
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,740
反而我觉得  你的诚实很令人佩服
I have to say, I find your honesty very refreshing.

520
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,068
我父亲曾经也是经常酗酒
My father had a drinking problem,

521
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:52,979
但我从来都不敢承认
And I was always too ashamed to admit it.

522
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:56,083
你比较有勇气
You've got backbone.

523
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:58,482
不像上次他带回来的那个女孩
Unlike that last girl he brought by.

524
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,147
-她叫什么来着  -艾丽丝
- What was her name? - Alice.

525
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,748
-我们没必要...  -艾丽莎
- We don't have to... - Alicia!

526
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,986
-艾丽莎  -克莉丝汀  你不知道  那个女生太可怕了
- Alicia. - She was dreadful, Christine.

527
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,155
显得有点病怏怏的  而且一点理想都没有
She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.

528
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,357
那其实不太算是...  -他们是在网上认识的
That's not really... - They met on the internet.

529
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,524
那是什么
What is that,

530
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,658
你不知道
Really?

531
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,998
-什么意思  -我对他太严厉了吗
- What does that mean? - Am I being too hard on him?

532
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,094
没有  一点都不会
No, not at all.

533
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,535
谢谢
Thanks a lot...

534
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,267
我觉得我应该尝尝你们带来的蛋糕
You know, I think I will try some of that cake of yours.

535
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,705
看啊  看起来真不错
Look at that. It looks great.

536
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,740
看起来很有趣
It looks so interesting.

537
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:26,213
你如果不喜欢  就只能说你有审美问题
You only dislike it if you hate delicious things.

538
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,842
不是我的问题
Not my problem.

539
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,245
真可爱
Lovely.

540
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:33,846
谢谢你  克莉丝汀  太棒了
Thank you, Christine. This is wonderful.

541
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,755
而且刚好用来转移话题
It also changed the subject nicely.

542
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,588
谢谢  看起来很好吃
Thank you. That looks good!

543
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:40,052
是啊
That's right.

544
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,530
这真的做的很精致  是不是
It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?

545
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,430
你有没有听到什么动静啊
Did you hear something?

546
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,529
没有  你还好吧
No. You okay?

547
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:48,364
真好吃
Tasty!

548
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,107
-我很喜欢  -我确实喜欢
- I like it a lot. - I do like it.

549
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,457
妈妈  刚才你说我们是在网上认识的
You know, mom, when you say we met on the internet,

550
00:56:54,457 --> 00:56:55,905
可能容易让人误解
It's a little misleading.

551
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:17,061
当然为了找个好伴侣那样做也无可厚非
Yes, well you need to do that to find a good mate.

552
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:18,658
但是你不能相信
You can't even trust

553
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,896
诸如你听到的或者别人写在网上的自我介绍
The things you hear or that people write about themselves.

554
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,996
-很好  -甚至连照片多数都是假的
- Very nice. - Even the pictures are false half the time.

555
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,300
这是真的
It's true.

556
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:26,433
我不觉得这算是一种误解
I don't think it's a misconception

557
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,137
那些有良好教养
To think that people of good breeding

558
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:29,944
并且成功的人应该
And success should be able to meet

559
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:32,443
在现实生活中寻找人生伴侣
Potential life partners in a realistic situation.

560
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:34,108
还有  别老是逛酒吧
Well, you also have a thing about bars.

561
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,523
你经常去吗  克莉丝汀
Would you, Christine?

562
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:52,665
-不  当然不去  -什么  但我们去的啊
- No, no, of course not. - What? What... but we did.

563
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,634
克莉丝  我们是在酒吧认识的啊  你怎么了
We met at a bar, Chris. What are you talking about?

564
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,502
她...
She...

565
00:57:56,606 --> 00:58:01,009
那不是三K党聚会的地方  妈妈  就是个酒吧
It's not a klan rally, mom. It's a bar.

566
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:04,746
对  我们  我们在酒吧邂逅
Yeah, we met... we met at a bar, 

567
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,151
从网上联系开始约会的
And we set up the date on the internet.

568
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:11,144
你没事吧
You okay? You okay?

569
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:15,983
喝点水  宝贝  喝点...  噎着了
Some water? Baby, have some... went down the wrong pipe.

570
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,291
天呢
Oh, my god!

571
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,641
对不起  我没有...  是不是有窗户开着
I'm sorry, I don't... there must be a window open.

572
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,004
克莉丝
Chris?

573
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:41,214
见鬼  我能听见你
Okay, I hear you!

574
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,808
你在地狱吗  -离我远点
What in the hell? - Leave me alone.

575
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,319
-听见吗  离我远点  -克莉丝  别这样
- Just leave me the hell alone! - Hey! Hey! Chris! Stop it!

576
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,515
宝贝  那里没人
Baby! There's no one there.

577
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,252
好吧
Okay.

578
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:56,930
-我觉得我应该走了  -是啊  我觉得也是
- I think I'd better go. - Yes, I think that would be best.

579
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,275
我知道  等一下  克莉丝...
I know. Wait, Chris...

580
00:58:59,276 --> 00:59:01,605
别跟着她  那个女孩有病
Don't follow her! She's a sick girl.

581
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:04,039
-妈妈  她需要帮助  -让她走吧
- Mom, she needs my help. - Let her go.

582
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:07,334
等等
Wait!

583
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,445
怎么了
What's the matter?

584
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,940
听着  我听你的杀了那只猫
Look, I did what you said! I killed that little kitty!

585
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,216
你满嘴胡话
You're so full of shit!

586
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,085
你要知道我们面对是一股强大的黑暗势力
These are elusive and powerful forces we are dealing with.

587
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,124
没有任何保证能一定成功
There are no guarantees.

588
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:42,544
我们必须直接跟这恶灵谈话
We must speak directly to this dark spirit.

589
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,811
我们必须劝止她抓走你的灵魂  尽快
We must dissuade it from taking your soul, and soon.

590
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,886
-我知道有人可以帮我们  -我该不该相信你
- I know someone who can help us. - And I'm supposed to trust you?

591
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:56,049
明天就是第三天了  之后  女妖就来抓你了
Tomorrow is the third day. After that, the lamia will come for you.

592
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,322
我们不能让她得逞  但你必须要明白
We can't let that happen. But you must understand,

593
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:03,992
帮我们的那个女人  自己也会身陷绝境
The woman who can help us must put herself at great risk.

594
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,826
-她是不会免费为你做的  -你想我怎样
- She will not do that for free. - What do you need from me?

595
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,401
一万美金
$10,000 cash

596
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,170
明天前准备好
By tomorrow.

597
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,419
-杰克斯先生  -什么事
- Mr Jacks. - Yeah?

598
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:33,359
问这挺难为情的  我知道正式任命还没下来
This is kind of awkward for me, and I know it's not official yet,

599
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,128
但我能不能预支我新职位的薪资
But I was wondering if I could get an advance for the new position.

600
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,431
副经理的职位吗
What, the assistant manager's position?

601
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:43,768
对  我有位家庭成员病得很厉害
Yes. See, one of my family members is really sick.

602
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:48,268
-他们虽不至于死  但也很危险  -克莉丝汀
- They're not gonna die, but they could. - Christine. Christine.

603
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:53,008
出了件事  麦克弗森那买卖昨晚被取消了
There's a problem. The Mcpherson deal was cancelled last night.

604
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,549
-什么  -对
- What? - Yeah.

605
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,914
我跟区域办公室刚说完
Right after I informed the regional

606
01:00:56,914 --> 01:00:58,949
我们有一笔大贷款项目
Office that we had this big loan pending,

607
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:02,547
我就发现他们跟我们的对手成交了
I find out that they just made their deal over at first national.

608
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,524
现在  我要找人来问问怎么回事
Now, I gotta call in to see what exactly happened,

609
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:08,564
目前为止  这事对你对我来说都不太好
But right now, this does not look too good for you or for me.

610
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:14,399
所以  副经理的职位先放一放
So, this assistant manager promotion has been delayed.

611
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,474
说实话  就目前发生的每件事
In fact, you know, I think, with everything that's been happening,

612
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:21,738
我想得把这份工作交给斯图
I think I'm gonna have to give this job to Stu.

613
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,409
斯图  我明白了
Stu. I see.

614
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:28,144
很抱歉  若是家里出了问题
I'm sorry. Look, if you've got family problems,

615
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,743
或许你该请几天假  解决之后...
Maybe you should take the day off, sort them out and...

616
01:02:30,323 --> 01:02:35,986
当铺

617
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,986
-多少钱  -总共3800元
- So, how much? - $3,800 for everything.

618
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,959
-我的首饰算了吗  -算了
- Including my jewellery? - Including.

619
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:48,929
这些东西肯定不止这个价
But this Stuff is worth so much more than that.

620
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:53,231
拜托  这是我的全部财产  我求求你
Please. This is all I have. I'm begging you.

621
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:56,401
要不要随你的便
Take it or leave it.

622
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,846
克莉丝  克莉丝
Chris? Chris?

623
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,513
宝贝
Baby?

624
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:33,369
我以为你有乳糖不耐症
I thought you were lactose intolerant.

625
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:35,871
对
I am.

626
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:40,278
不过我想  管他呢  我就要吃冰激凌
But then I thought, "screw it, I'm eating ice cream."

627
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,214
我把钱给拉姆・加斯了
I paid Rham Jas.

628
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:51,717
什么  没开玩笑吧
What? You're kidding me.

629
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,120
我付钱给他
I paid him.

630
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:58,224
为什么  我以为你不信那个的
Why? I mean, I thought that you didn't believe.

631
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:01,694
我也不知道什么该信什么不该信
I don't know what I believe in any more.

632
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:05,571
我不信  但我知道你信
I really don't, but I know that you believe in this.

633
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,337
而且这对你来说很重要
I know how important it is to you,

634
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,812
为这你遭了很大的罪
And I know how much pain this is causing you.

635
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,978
我还记得
And, I also remembered...

636
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:20,484
我爱上你的那个晚上
I remembered a promise that I made

637
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,923
我曾做出承诺
The night I fell in love with you.

638
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,255
我跟自己说
I told myself that I would...

639
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:30,932
我会一辈子呵护你  照顾你
I would always look out for you. I'd always take care of you.

640
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,259
所以我付钱给他了
So I paid him.

641
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,273
你还记得爱上我的那个晚上
You remember the night that you fell in love with me?

642
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,402
第二个晚上也记得呢
I remember the second I fell in love with you.

643
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,514
天呀
Oh, my god.

644
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,859
确定不用我跟你进去吗
You sure you don't want me to go in with you?

645
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:03,398
他说我要独自面对
He said I should come alone.

646
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,799
我知道  他也跟我说了
Yeah, I know, I know he did. He told me the same thing.

647
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,834
克莉丝汀
Christine, if you will permit me

648
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:48,137
请允许我介绍  肖恩珊蒂娜
The pleasure of an introduction, Shaun San Dena.

649
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,074
-幸会  -你好吗
- Welcome. - How do you do?

650
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:57,248
肖恩珊蒂娜是经验丰富的灵媒师
Shaun San Denais an experienced medium.

651
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,447
并且  她曾与那个女妖打过交道
Furthermore, she's personally been touched by the Lamia.

652
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:05,017
多年前  就在这间屋子里我见过它
I first encountered this spirit many years ago in this very house.

653
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,023
当时是怎么回事
And what happened?

654
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:14,934
一个男孩的灵魂被它抢走了
I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.

655
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:24,142
我苦守了这么多年
I have waited these long years

656
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:28,707
等待时机救赎自己
For a chance at redeeming myself,

657
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:32,347
斩妖除魔
A chance to destroy the foul thing.

658
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,038
今晚  我的机会来了
Tonight, my chance will come.

659
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:48,230
我需要你来引诱她
But to summon it, I will need your help.

660
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:51,367
你敢吗
Can you be strong?

661
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,408
我试试
I'll try.

662
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,746
我前夫桑德尔  也是灵媒师
My late husband, Sandor, was also medium.

663
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,254
他把房子建在这儿
He chose this site to build a house upon

664
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:10,257
因为他认为这地方存在某种力量
Because he sensed certain forces at work here.

665
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:14,919
这地方  有种特殊的...
In this place, there is a particular...

666
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,263
一种特殊的能量结界
A particular confluence of forces

667
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:28,536
可以打开一扇门
Which allows a doorway to be opened through which we may pass...

668
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,881
阳间与阴间的通道
...and through which others may pass into our world.

669
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,286
请坐
Please be seated.

670
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:13,646
怎么回事
What's going on?

671
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,390
我们做的每件事都是为你好
Everything we're doing is for your own good.

672
01:08:16,391 --> 01:08:20,491
没事的  克莉丝汀  请坐
Please. Christine, please.

673
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,432
谢谢
Thank you.

674
01:08:56,366 --> 01:09:00,359
我被魂灵附体时  把我的手放在羊身上
Once the spirit has entered me, put my hand upon the animal.

675
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,530
-明白吗  -好
- Do you understand? - Yes.

676
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:07,697
我会把女妖魂灵逼到山羊身上
I force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat.

677
01:09:07,697 --> 01:09:10,203
米洛斯  到时候出剑
Milos, that's when you strike.

678
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:14,706
明白
I understand.

679
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,653
大家都要请灵
We all must be receptive.

680
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:46,412
-我该做些什么  -你得让黑暗进来
- What am I supposed to do? - You must allow the darkness in.

681
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:50,178
引导幽灵进入自己的灵魂里
You must invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit.

682
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:53,215
-我很怕  -是的
- I'm scared. - Yes.

683
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:58,088
重复这句话  迎接死灵至吾魂魄
Now repeat these words, "I welcome the dead into my soul."

684
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:06,056
-迎接死灵至吾魂魄   -一定要虔诚
- I welcome the dead into my soul. - You must believe it!

685
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:09,202
迎接死灵至吾魂魄
I welcome the dead into my soul.

686
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,835
-迎接死灵至吾魂魄  -迎接死灵至吾魂魄
- I welcome the dead into my soul. - I welcome the dead into my soul.

687
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,371
-迎接死灵至吾魂魄   -至吾魂魄
- I welcome the dead into my soul. - ...into my soul.

688
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:24,018
迎接死灵至吾魂魄  迎接死灵至吾魂魄
I welcome the dead into my soul. I welcome the dead into my soul.

689
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:33,562
迎接死灵至吾魂魄
I welcome the dead into my soul.

690
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:34,857
迎接死灵至...
I welcome the dead...

691
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:43,269
迎接死灵至吾魂魄
I welcome the dead into my soul.

692
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,896
迎接死灵至吾...
I welcome the dead into...

693
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:50,776
周围有其他魂魄
Something else is here with us.

694
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,473
是的
Yes.

695
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:24,079
不是女妖
This is not the Lamia.

696
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:27,412
是一些...
It is the spirit of some

697
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:31,451
多年不得超生的怨灵
Unsettled soul from years ago.

698
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:35,481
有时这些游魂会在门周围游荡
Sometimes the unsettled ones linger by the door.

699
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,254
还有其它的魂魄
There are others here, as well.

700
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,440
走开  愚蠢的野鬼  走开
Begone, foolish spirits! Begone!

701
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:07,555
她来了
She is coming.

702
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,660
肖恩珊蒂娜里面是谁
Who now inhabits the body of Shaun San Dena?

703
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,894
女妖
Lamia!

704
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:09,068
女妖  你渴求什么
Lamia, what is it you desire?

705
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:13,479
我渴求克莉丝汀的灵魂
I desire the soul of Christine Brown!

706
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,446
就等她一进坟墓  我们就把她吃光
We will feast upon it as she festers in the grave!

707
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,080
不是我干的  是我们经理吉姆・杰克斯
No! It was my manager, Jim Jacks!

708
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:22,021
- 他才是  他...-闭嘴
- He was the one! He was... - Silence!

709
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:26,356
女妖  你肯定能放弃这位无关紧要的灵魂
Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded from taking this insignificant woman.

710
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,363
她肯定不值得你大费周章
Surely she is not worthy of your greatness.

711
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,606
不
No!

712
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:47,013
我为你来的  克莉丝汀
I come for you, Christine.

713
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,776
你是我的
You're mine!

714
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,220
不
No!

715
01:14:57,393 --> 01:15:01,193
你阴我  邪恶的贱人
You tricked me! You black-hearted whore!

716
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,857
-米洛斯 快  -婊子
- Now, Milos, now! - You bitch.

717
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:19,146
走开  不洁的灵魂
Away, unclean spirit.

718
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,562
女妖
Lamia!

719
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,963
吾  唤汝入人间者
As one who summoned you to this circle,

720
01:15:38,963 --> 01:15:41,261
命令汝即退人间
I command you to leave this instant.

721
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,200
克莉丝汀
Christine!

722
01:15:55,851 --> 01:16:00,379
我不稀罕你的猫  你这臭婊子
I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!

723
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,428
肖恩珊蒂娜
Shaun san dena!

724
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,371
驱赶恶灵
You must banish the spirit!

725
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:17,563
好
Yes!

726
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,234
米洛斯
Milos!

727
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:55,908
-我的天  我还好  -谢天谢地
- Oh, my god. I'm okay. - Thank god!

728
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,912
-还活着  -难以置信
- I'm okay. - Unbelievable!

729
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:02,507
-你做到了  -谢天谢地
- You did it! - Thank god.

730
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,018
我尽力了
I tried.

731
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,146
你还好吗
Are you okay?

732
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,754
天呢  帮帮忙
Oh, my god. Help me!

733
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,426
叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

734
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,929
她有气吗
Is she breathing?

735
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:25,030
没
No.

736
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,441
天呢
Oh, my gosh.

737
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,411
-太让人伤心了  -是的
- It's so sad. - Yes.

738
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,321
怎么会这样
Strange how things work out.

739
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:20,351
她等了40年  就为除掉女妖
She waited 40 years for another chance to overcome the Lamia,

740
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:26,727
最后  生前最后一晚  她成功了
And finally, on the last night of her life, she did.

741
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:30,163
不  恐怕你搞错了
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

742
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:34,274
灵媒师是消灭不了女妖的
The Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.

743
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,679
今晚失败了  抱歉
This is our lesson tonight. I'm sorry.

744
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,680
-但我看见她除掉那家伙了  -没有
- But I saw her get rid of the thing. - No.

745
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:43,047
它不过是被驱赶走了
You saw her drive it. That is all.

746
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:46,778
它还会回来的  山羊从没被斩尽杀绝的
It will be back. The goat was never slaughtered.

747
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,717
今晚一过
When this night is through,

748
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:54,189
女妖就会出来寻求被咒物的主人
The Lamia will come for the owner of the accursed object.

749
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:02,633
除非  你不再是主人  你那枚纽扣呢
Unless, of course, you are no longer the owner. Do you have the button?

750
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,210
把它送人  你的诅咒就解除了
Make a gift of it and you've given the curse away.

751
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,581
为何之前你不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me this before?

752
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:23,216
因为女妖会撕裂你给的那个人的灵魂
Because the Lamia will tear the soul out of whoever you give that to.

753
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,817
他们永世不得超生
They'll burn in hell for eternity.

754
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,656
是我把他们送去的
And I would have sent them there.

755
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,565
我是你的帮凶
And I would be your accomplice.

756
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:38,903
在天亮之前你要做出决定
Whatever you decide, you have till morning.

757
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,360
好了吗
Is it over?

758
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:04,029
好了
It's over.

759
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:08,996
克莱!
Clay!

760
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,510
我咒你下地狱
You will burn in hell!

761
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:20,542
我咒你下地狱  婊子我咒你下地狱
You will burn in hell! You bitch, you'll burn in hell!

762
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:22,847
你的死期到了
Your turn's coming!

763
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:25,819
-我咒你下地狱  -还好吗
- You will burn in hell! - You okay?

764
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,354
见鬼了
Holy shit.

765
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,562
好吧  你确定你还能去圣巴巴拉吗
Okay, you sure you're still okay about the santa barbara trip?

766
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:45,731
-是的  我没事  -真的吗
- Yeah, I'm fine. - Yeah?

767
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,454
我什么时候接你
And what time should I get you?

768
01:20:47,454 --> 01:20:49,743
我和你在车站碰头吧
It's better if I meet you at the station.

769
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,345
路上我有点事要办
There's something i've gotta do on the way.

770
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,506
我帮你办  来的路上我...
I can do it. You want me to do it on my way to...

771
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:56,016
不要  我自己能行
No! No. I've got it under control.

772
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,586
-那么7:30在...  -啊  我的信封呢
- We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the... - Wait! Where's my envelope?

773
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:02,190
-什么信封  -在我钱包里  我刚还拿着的
- What envelope? - It was in my purse. I just had it!

774
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:04,350
-不过是一枚信封  -不  应该在这里的
- It's just an envelope. - No, it's gotta be here!

775
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:07,361
在这呢  终于找到了
It's here, so we'll find it eventually.

776
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,361
-我的天呀  -是啊
- Oh, my god. - Okay.

777
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:12,093
我以为弄丢了呢  这下好了
I thought I'd lost it. Okay.

778
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,426
再见  7:30  别迟到啦
Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.

779
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,946
爸爸  我们去玩天使游戏好不
Dad, can we go to the angel game?

780
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:40,087
去看道格队的比赛怎么样
What about the dodgers?

781
01:21:40,088 --> 01:21:41,088
我们只能在城里待几天
We're only gonna be in town for a few days.

782
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:46,129
我确定要是告诉他我有多在乎你
I'm sure if I just tell him how much I care about you,

783
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,566
他会理解的
I mean, he's gotta understand.

784
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:54,571
您确定不想要别的吗
Are you sure you don't want anything else?

785
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:55,632
不要
No.

786
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:58,906
那你要整晚坐在这儿喝咖啡啊
So you're just gonna sit here drinking coffee all night long.

787
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:02,246
可能吧  这跟你有什么关系
Yes. Maybe! What's it to you?

788
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:06,549
美女  我是靠小费赚钱的  喝咖啡的没小费
Honey, I make my money on tips. Coffee drinkers don't tip.

789
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:06,915
美女
Honey,

790
01:22:06,915 --> 01:22:10,557
只管送咖啡  否则我把这个给你  折磨死你
Just keep the coffee coming or i'll give you a tip you won't forget.

791
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:56,098
天啊  真是太棒的惊喜了
Oh, my gosh. What a delightful surprise.

792
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:59,769
你真是世界上最好的人
You're the sweetest person in the world.

793
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,105
以前的事我过往不计  斯图
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

794
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:06,181
10分钟马上出现  否则我跟经理说
Just get here in 10 minutes or I'm gonna tell mr Jacks

795
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,476
你不想让他知道的事
Something you don't want me to tell him.

796
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:10,882
是吗  比如说
Oh, yeah? Like what?

797
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:14,951
第一  从我这偷了麦克弗森贷款文件
Well, for starters, that you stole the Mcpherson loan file off my desk

798
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:18,390
交给竞争对手  现在你只剩下9分钟
And gave it to First National. Now you got nine minutes!

799
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,560
-续杯  -真的吗
- Give me another. - Seriously?

800
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:36,471
克莉丝汀  拜托别告发我
Oh, god, Christine, please don't tell on me.

801
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:38,676
要是被我爸发现了...
I mean, if my dad ever finds out...

802
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:42,046
-你想要什么  -我要给你一件东西
- Just tell me what you want. - I need to give something to you.

803
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,243
-一件小礼物  -礼物?
- A little gift. - A gift?

804
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:48,019
我不明白  我以为你叫我到这来
But I don't understand. I thought you called me down here

805
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,990
因为我把贷款交给竞争对手
Because I gave that loan to first national...

806
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:53,220
你不用明白  闭上你的臭嘴
Look, you don't need to understand. Just shut up!

807
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:57,393
这份礼物我现在给你  它就是你的东西啦
Now, this gift that I'm giving you, it'll become your property.

808
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,093
你是它的主人  明白吗
You'll be the owner, all right?

809
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:04,235
明白
Okay.

810
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:10,737
明白
Okay.

811
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:15,246
怎么啦
What?

812
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:17,743
当我啥也没说
Forget it.

813
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:21,248
但我想你把它给我  是想了结贷款那事的
But I thought you wanted to give it to me 'cause of the loan Stuff.

814
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:22,721
走吧
Just leave.

815
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:28,796
好吧  谢谢你  克莉丝汀
Okay. Thank you so much, Christine.

816
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,232
-你保证别告诉我爸  -滚
- But you're not gonna tell my dad, right? - Go!

817
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:38,398
好吧
Okay.

818
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:51,309
谁该下地狱呢
Who does deserve this?

819
01:25:01,174 --> 01:25:03,267
死亡讣告

820
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:14,267
这有可能吗
Well? Is it possible?

821
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,570
有些死者身上会带有吉普赛的咒语
There are gypsy blessings bestowed upon the dead.

822
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,773
他们把礼物送给死者
They give gifts to their departed

823
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:25,182
来讨好死灵  这样  魂魄得以不灭
To curry favour with the deceased's soul, for, truly, the soul never dies.

824
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:32,016
对  我相信你可以把诅咒加给一个过世的人
Yes. I do believe you can give the curse to someone who has passed on,

825
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:34,019
但你必须举行正式的仪式
But you must make a formal gift

826
01:25:34,061 --> 01:25:35,819
把受诅咒的东西作为礼物送给死者
Of the accursed object to the deceased.

827
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:37,628
我还不止要这么做
I'll do better than that.

828
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:39,628
我要把它塞进老妖怪的喉咙里
I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!

829
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,701
给她点厉害...
I'm gonna get some...

830
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,435
我把它还给你
I'm giving it back to you!

831
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,575
你要拿好这个
You're gonna take this thing.

832
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:38,609
你不是要吗
Are you gonna take this thing?

833
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:42,547
拿着
Take it!

834
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,503
这是你最后一次抓我的头发
That's the last of my hair you're getting!

835
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:09,942
我克莉丝汀 布朗特此将此受诅的纽扣
I, Christine Brown, do hereby make a formal gift of this button

836
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:12,350
作为正式的礼物送给西尔维娅・加纳什
To you, Sylvia Ganush!

837
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:16,190
噎死你  老妖怪
Choke on it, bitch!

838
01:28:31,206 --> 01:28:32,673
再见
Goodbye.

839
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:05,032
我是克莉丝汀  请留言稍后回您电话
Hi, it's Christine. Leave a message and I'll call you back.

840
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:08,099
克莉丝汀  我是吉姆 杰克斯
Christine, it's Jim Jim Jacks.

841
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:09,568
很抱歉这么早打给你
I'm sorry I'm calling so early,

842
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:10,457
但昨天晚上
But last night,

843
01:30:10,457 --> 01:30:14,200
我发现斯图・鲁宾干得一些坏事
I found some troubling information about our friend Stu rubin.

844
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:17,934
显然  他偷了你的麦克弗森贷款文件
Apparently, he stole your file on the Mcpherson loan

845
01:30:18,046 --> 01:30:21,379
然后交给竞争对手企图自己捞一笔
And then tried to broker his own deal at first national.

846
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,417
我猜他以为我们没查出来
I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.

847
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:26,147
本来也没查  但是1小时前
And we wouldn't have either, except that an hour ago,

848
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,054
他到我家  想把所有的过错都归咎于你
He came by my house and tried to pin the whole thing on you.

849
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:34,653
我戳穿他自相矛盾的谎话之后
After I confronted him about a few inconsistencies in his story,

850
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:39,132
他就歇斯底里个没完  我就把他炒了
He broke down crying and, well, we won't be seeing him around any more.

851
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,499
我想告诉你一声  周一早上来上班
So I just wanted you to know that, come monday morning,

852
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:47,336
副经理的位置非你莫属
That assistant manager's position will be waiting for you.

853
01:30:59,154 --> 01:31:01,588
班森乘客
Passenger Benson, please meet your party

854
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,749

我们还没开门
We're not open yet.

862
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:38,716
我和男友今天的旅程将会非常特殊
My boyfriend and I are taking this really special trip this morning.

863
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:41,153

Please?

864
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,900

867
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,564
宝贝抱抱
Hey! Oh, man! Have a body

868
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:57,076
天啊  真高兴你来了  我有好多话要跟你说
God, I'm so glad you're here. So many things I wanna tell you.

869
01:31:57,212 --> 01:31:58,338

Wait, there's something I wanna say

870
01:31:58,413 --> 01:32:01,348
-我就直接了当吧  -好 说吧
- While I have it straight in my head. - Okay. Go ahead.

871
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,884
你一直都相信我
You never stopped believing in me.

872
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,414
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

873
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:12,250
还有些事  我以前不承认
And there's something else, something that I couldn't admit to before.

874
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:17,864
我本可以延长加纳什夫人的贷款  但我没有
I could have given mrs Ganush another extension on her loan, but I didn't.

875
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:23,562
那我的主张  是我的错
It was my decision, and it was wrong of me.

876
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:35,549
你真是好心肠
You have such a good heart.

That's too bad, because I... Look what I found. I found this in the car.

882
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:55,133
我以为...
I thought...

883
01:32:55,637 --> 01:32:58,071
或许你可以...
And I thought maybe you could...

884
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,067
或许你可以把它补回去
I thought maybe you could sew it back on.

- Oh, my god! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

890
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:17,822
停下  克莉丝  天呀
Stop! Chris! Oh, god!

891
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:23,394
天呢  不要不要不要
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, no! Hey! Oh, god, no!
