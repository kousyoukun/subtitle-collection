I hope to have more money soon. I just need a little more time. You...

124
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:40,096
我觉得经理可能不会同意您的延期要求
I don't think my manager's going to extend you any more credit.

125
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:45,362

我们应该帮帮她
There's gotta be something we can do to help her.

Well, apparently, we've already granted her two extensions.

And, you know, on this type of foreclosure, we seize the trapped equity

133
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,980
银行要支出很大一笔费用
And the bank makes a sizable amount in fees.

134
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,277
我们会让她无家可归
We would have to throw her out of her house.

135
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,079
这是个棘手问题
It's a tough decision.

136
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,752
你看着办吧
Your call.

137
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,775
我会妥善处理的
I'll take care of it.

138
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,938
加纳什夫人  很抱歉
Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

139
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,803
我们不能再提供延期还贷了
But another extension on the loan is out of the question.

140
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,366
-你说什么  -我希望能帮上忙  但是银行的规定
- What? - I would like to help, but it is in the bank's...

141
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,881
不  求求你  这是我的家  以后我住哪里
No, please, this is my home. Where will I live?

142
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,947
您有提到您孙女  或许您可能和她一起住
You list your granddaughter as a reference. Maybe you could stay with her.

143
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,645
我不想给她增加负担
I would not burden her.

144
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,818
还有一些设施很好的老人院
And there are several fine assisted living facilities for the elderly...

145
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:50,727
疗养院吗  我可不住那些地方
A nursing home? No, I would never live in one of those places.

146
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,494
实在很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

147
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,023
我是个有自尊心的女人  布朗小姐
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

148
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,364
从来没求过人
And never have I begged for anything.

149
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,765
但现在  我求求你
But now, I beg for you.

150
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,603
-我向你跪下了  -加纳什夫人  请别这样
- I humble myself before you. - Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.

151
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,369
-请站起来说  -我西尔维亚・加纳什  求求你
- Please stand up. - I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

152
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,435
以我母亲的名义  求求你
On my mother's grave, I beg you!

153
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,712
请松手  保安  别这样
Please let go. Let go! Security! Stop!

154
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,552
-那边  比利  -来啦
- Over here, Billy! Over here! - We're coming.

155
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,463
你羞辱我
You shame me.

156
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,739
我求你  你却羞辱我
I beg you, and you shame me.

157
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,241
夫人  您的业务办理完毕了吧
I think your business is finished here, ma'am.

158
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,416
走吧
Let's go.

159
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:25,918
加纳什夫人
Mrs Ganush...

160
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,824
快出去
Get out of here!

161
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,095
-过来  夫人  -走吧
- Come on, ma'am. - Let's go.

162
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,243
从没见过这样的人
I never saw anything quite like that before.

163
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,406
你没事吧
Are you okay?

164
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,843
你处理的很好
You handled that just right, you know.

165
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,429
-晚安  明天见  -好的
- Good night. See you tomorrow. - Okay.

166
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,769
我刚看完这份麦克弗森的贷款
You know, I just finished going over this McPherson loan.

167
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,275
-你做得不错  -谢谢
- This is very impressive work. - Thanks.

168
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,812
你能不能今晚带回去做完
Would you mind taking this home tonight and finishing it up?

169
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,145
因为我想明天一早就给区域副总过目
Because I would like to show it to the regional veep in the morning.

170
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,014
-我很乐意  -那太好了
- I would love to. - Great.

171
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,484
谢谢
Thank you.

172
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,046
目前副经理的人选
And as far as that assistant manager's position goes,

173
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,123
你已经是首选了
You're at the top of the list.

174
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,842
你羞辱了我
You shamed me.

175
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,462
我赢啦   你个死老太婆
I beat you, you old bitch!

176
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,326
不
No!

177
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:39,289
女妖
Lamia.

178
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,807
很快  就换成你来求我了
Soon it will be you who comes begging to me.

179
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:32,174
-她就在那  -谢谢
- She's right over there. - Thank you, thank you.

180
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,816
他们派了警察去找她谈话
Once they send some officers over to have a talk with her,

181
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,189
以后她就不会来烦你了  知道吗
she's not gonna be bothering you any more, okay?

182
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,751
你就别再想了
So don't even think about her.

183
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,387
我会给杰克斯先生打电话
And I'm gonna call Mr Jacks and just make sure

184
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,659
确保他能每晚安排保安送你上车  好吗
He can have somebody walk you to your car every night, okay?

185
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:48,995
好的
Okay.

186
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:53,335
你没事  真是谢天谢地  你没事  对吧
I just thank God you're okay. You are okay, right?

187
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,435
我没事
I'm fine.

188
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,108
怎么了  有什么事吗
What? What's the matter?

189
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,909
或许我应该给她办理延期还款的
It's just that maybe I could have gotten her another extension on her loan.

190
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,382
克莉丝  别这么做
Chris, no, don't do that.

191
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:09,615
你说过银行已经为她延期了两次  是吧
You said the bank granted this woman two extensions already, right?

192
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,781
那就对不起了  不按揭还款就得没收房子
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage, you lose your house.

193
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,553
那女人能指望什么  这不是你的错
What does this woman expect? It's not your fault.

194
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,187
你不必自责
You can't beat yourself up over it.

195
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,901
我是说那女人能指望什么  这不是你的错
I mean, what'd she expect? It's not your fault.

196
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:30,136
不管你能做或不能做
And regardless of what you may or may not have been able to do,

197
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,038
她都没有正当的理由
That's still no justification for her...

198
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,550
这是什么  怎么啦
What is it? What's wrong?

199
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,059
-你听到了吗  -听到什么
- Did you hear that? - What?

200
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:48,983
真的吗  你没听到吗
Really? You didn't?

201
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,157
没有  什么声音
No. What?

202
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:59,665
我知道可能感觉会比较怪  但是我想算一卦
I know this is gonna sound weird, but I wanna get my fortune read.

203
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,676
现在吗  你不是开玩笑吧
Now? Are you kidding?

204
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:09,178
算了吧  克莉丝  我来帮你算吧
Come on, Chris. I'll read your fortune for you.

205
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,673
在不久的将来  我们一起坐车
In the near future, we are gonna get in the car,

206
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,685
-然后回家放松  -克莱  我真的很想算命
- Go home and relax. - Clay, I really want to do this.

207
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,517
为什么  因为那个老女人吗
Why? Because of what happened with that old woman?

208
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,922
克莉丝  我想现在该送你回家了
Chris, I really think we should just get you home now.

209
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,287
你能陪我吗
Can you do this for me?

210
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,038
但愿我的学生不会看见我来
I pray to God none of my students see me here.

211
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,773
那样我唯一能教的班级  就只有  比如伪善101
The only class I'll be able to teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.

212
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,607
这里有很多选择
Yeah, there's so many things to choose from here.

213
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,778
不幸的是  并不是我要找的
Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,

214
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,278
比如怪异的干猴子的小脑袋
Which is a weird little dried monkey head.

215
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,548
等等  没关系  他有一个
Wait, no, never mind, he's got one.

216
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,558
我叫拉姆・加斯  是个预言者
I am Rham Jas, seer.

217
00:24:56,395 --> 00:25:01,230
-我叫克莉丝汀  这位是克莱  -或许你已经知道了  是吧
- I'm Christine and this is Clay. -But you probably already knew that, right?

218
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:05,837
-开个玩笑  -我能帮你什么忙吗
- Just kidding. -How can I help you?

219
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:09,500
我想占卜一下自己的命运  可以吗
I would like to have my fortune read. Can you do that?

220
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,635
我能看到某些能量
I have the ability to see certain energies.

221
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:16,340
有时  这些能量就是事物的前兆
Sometimes these energies are a foretoken of things to come.

222
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,677
请支付60美元
$60, please.

223
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,513
-真的假的  -当然
- Seriously? - Yes.

224
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:23,248
60美元  这个开价是不是太高了
Sixty... Doesn't that seem a little steep for this sort of thing?

225
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:28,157
-如果你不是诚心诚意  请回吧  -那好  走吧  克莉丝
- If you're not serious, please go. -All right. Come on, Chris.

226
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:30,821
等等  我来付吧
Wait, wait! I'll... I'll pay.

227
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,093
不用  我来付吧
No, you know what? You know what? I got it. I got it.

228
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:38,931
-给  -白金卡  不错
- There you go. - Platinum card. Very good.

229
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,272
谢谢
Thank you.

230
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,245
-过来  亲爱的  -谢谢
-Here, here, baby. -Thanks.

231
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,541
应该的
Sure.

232
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,715
那边请
Uh-uh. Please.

233
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:56,610
好的
Okay.

234
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,223
你想了解自己的命运
So, you wish to know something of your destiny.

235
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:01,453
-是的  -非常好
- Yes. - Very good.

236
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,051
来看看店里的天意
Let's see what the fates have in store.

237
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,393
弗洛伊德曾说命运并不是天意的表现
You know, Freud said destiny was not an act of fate,

238
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,227
而是由我们潜意识产生
But rather something created by our subconscious

239
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,097
并控制我们有意识的选择
To control our conscious choices.

240
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:14,229
没错  不过我们不能单凭智力去认知世界
That's true. But we cannot attempt to understand the world by intellect alone.

241
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,636
-卡尔・荣格  -是的
- Carl Jung. - Yes.

242
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,370
出自他的论文  心理学形态
From his treatise Psychological Types.

243
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:23,880
-那么  -荣格  新时代人们最喜爱的心理学家
- So... - Jung, the New Agers' favourite psychologist.

244
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:26,247
因为他不怕把上帝拿到公式里讲
Because he wasn't afraid to bring God into the equation.

245
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,616
他不怕把上帝拿到...
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God into...

246
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,121
-克莱  别说了  -好的  我知道  开始吧
- Clay, Clay, come on. - Let's do it. I know. Come on. Let's start.

247
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,986
-可以开始了吗  -我已经准备好了
- Shall we?  - I'm ready.

248
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,752
很好  请把你的手给我
Very well. Please, give me your hand.

249
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,488
好的
Okay.

250
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,725
这样放  好的
This way. Okay.

251
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,994
你的工作和钱有关
You work with money.

252
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:49,399
没错
That's right.

253
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,109
最近你丢了东西
And you've recently lost something.

254
00:26:55,281 --> 00:27:00,742
-好像没有  -不  不  你还没丢
- No, I don't think so. - No. No, you haven't lost anything.

255
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,186
但是你有东西被人拿走
But something's been taken from you.

256
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,251
没有
No.

257
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,794
-一粒钮扣  -天哪  是的
- A button. - Oh, my God. Yes!

258
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,527
谁都看得出她少了粒钮扣  那又怎样
Well, anyone can see she's missing a button! So what?

259
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:13,860
但是  克莱  这的确很奇怪
But, Clay, it was really strange.

260
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,366
今天那个老女人  从我袖子上拿走了一粒钮扣
The old woman today, she took a button from my sleeve.

261
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:20,303
-她为什么要这么做  -你们两个能不能安静点
- Why would she do that? - If you would both please just be quiet!

262
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:36,108
-我想今晚差不多了  -怎么啦
- I think that's enough for tonight. - What's wrong?

263
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,744
我很累了  而且天色已晚
I'm tired, and I see it's become quite late.

264
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:41,744
当然  我会退钱给你
I will, of course, refund your money.

265
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:44,379
等等  你看到了什么吗
Wait, wait, wait! Did you see something?

266
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,585
一个恶灵缠上你了
A dark spirit has come upon you.

267
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,126
-什么意思  -他的意思是...
- What do you mean? - Well, he's...

268
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,093
你有去墓地亵渎死者吗
Did you blaspheme the dead while visiting a graveyard?

269
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,256
-没有  -你玩过占卜盘吗
- No! - Did you play with a Ouija board

270
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,196
或者和练习黑暗魔法的人有交往
Or consort with those who practise the black arts?

271
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,598
好了  别紧张  拜托
All right, take it easy, man. Come on.

272
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,727
等等  克莱  我都没有做过
Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay. No. No, I didn't.

273
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,633
或许有人对你下了诅咒
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

274
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,790
那他怎么会知道那些
Then how did he know all that? 

275
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:11,814
知道什么  你丢了钮扣吗
Know what? That you lost a button?

276
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,141
再说了  他并不是很了解
And by the way, he didn't really know that much.

277
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,153
他做了一些可能的猜测  然后
He makes a couple of good guesses, then he...

278
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,156
他说动你  然后给你一堆的问题
He stirs you up, and then he leaves you with all these questions

279
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,818
然后顺手递上自己的名片
And, conveniently, his business card.

280
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,986
克莉丝  他只是个江湖骗子
Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.

281
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,491
但是他没有要钱啊  他想退给我们  记得吗
But he didn't want the money. He tried to give it back, remember?

282
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:32,332
其实他在装  最后还不是收了  是吧
Well, he sort of tried, but in the end, he took it, didn't he?

283
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:36,831
可能吧
I guess so.

284
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,095
我要去找拖你车的人
I gotta go meet the guy that's towing your car,

285
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,190
你会没事吧
So you gonna be okay?

286
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,599
-是的  -那就好  猫咪要好好照顾她哦
- Yeah. - All right. Kitty, take care of her.

287
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,365
-一小时后见  我爱你  -好的
- I'll see you in about an hour. Love you. - Okay.

288
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:08,700
好的
Okay.

289
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,596
-给  放在嘴唇上  -谢谢
- Here. Put that on your lip. - Thank you.

290
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,173
真不敢相信她竟然到家里来了
I can't believe she came to the house.

291
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:02,173
这太疯狂了  我要报警
This is so nuts. I'm calling the cops.

292
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:05,402
-不是她干的  -那会是谁
- It wasn't her. - Who was it then?

293
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,008
我不知道  看不清是什么
I don't know. I couldn't see who it was.

294
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:08,708
一定是她  肯定是她
Of course it was her. It had to be her.

295
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:10,715
不要  克莱  谁都不是
No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!

296
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:12,944
肯定是某个人  克莉丝  一定是某个人
It was somebody. Chris, it had to be somebody.

297
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,518
灯灭了  你看不清楚是谁罢了
The lights were out. You just couldn't see who it was,

298
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,783
-但我猜是  -克莱  当时根本没人
- But I'm guessing it was... - Clay, there wasn't anybody here.

299
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,353
那会是谁干的
Then who did this?

300
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,523
谁打你的脸了
Who hit you in the face?

301
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,870
我认为是今天早前受袭击的一个反应
I think it's just a reaction to her being attacked earlier in the day.

302
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,463
是的  外伤后压力的典型症状
Yeah. Classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

303
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,975
是的  她有恐慌和惊吓症状  所以...
Yeah, she's showing signs of panic and paranoia. so...

304
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,546
不  不  不  我没事
No, no, no, I'll be fine.

305
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:43,979
好的
All right.

306
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,809
嗨  嗨
Hey, hey.

307
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,617
现在感觉怎么样了
How you doing?

308
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:52,883
-好多了  -是吗
-Better. -Yeah?

309
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,050
多亏医生的开导
Especially after the doctor explained it to me.

310
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,094
他说在暴力受害者身上
He said that victims of violence,

311
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,630
-偶尔会发生...-发生悲剧再现
- They re-experience... - Re-experience their trauma.

312
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,399
我错以为是什么更严重的事
I misinterpreted it to be something more than it was.

313
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:07,828
-碰巧罢了  -我只是...感觉...
- Happens. - I just... I feel...

314
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,908
-怎么了  -有点难堪
- What? - Kind of embarrassed.

315
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,229
别开玩笑了
Are you kidding?

316
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,741
跟我在一块儿还有什么好难堪的
No. You never have to be embarrassed with me.

317
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:18,344
记住了
Okay?

318
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:27,648
嗨  要不周六出去旅旅游散散心  怎么样
Hey, listen, I was thinking maybe we could take a little trip on Saturday,

319
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,523
-坐火车去圣巴巴拉  -你的乡村木屋
- Get on the train and go to Santa barbara. - Your folks' cabin.

320
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,027
是啊  如果你想去
Yeah, if you're up for it, the cabin.

321
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:34,428
-天呢  我当然愿意去  -真的  好极了
- Oh, my god, I would love to! - Yeah? Good.

- That'd be so exciting. - Baby, you're gonna love it.

323
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:37,959
-你肯定喜欢的  -好的
- You're gonna love it. - Okay, good.

324
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,094
我一直打算让你去瞧瞧呢
I'm excited for you to see it.

325
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,762
-那些树 还都是私人的  -那真是太好了
- These trees and it's private. - That would be great.

326
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:42,363
肯定会很好玩
It'll be great. It'll be good.

327
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:47,878
我们可以可以...  我们可以聊天什么的
I think we need to. and we can just... We can just talk and stuff.

328
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,003
怎么了
What?

329
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,346
-怎么了  -我有点...有点头昏脑胀
- What's the matter? - I couldn't... I couldn't wake up.

330
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:07,684
没事的  过来  那只是一个梦罢了
It's okay. Okay. Come here. It was just a dream.

331
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:23,095
宝贝  租的车停在那边
Baby, that's the rental car they dropped off this morning.

Hey, baby, try not to piss off any old ladies today, okay?

335
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,054

克莉丝汀  你太幽默了
Ha, ha. Very funny, Christine.

338
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:01,865
这是什么
What's this?

339
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,168
你要干嘛
What do you want?

340
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:07,507
我想让你再教教我关于贷款手续
I need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures.

341
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:12,349
我现在有点心烦   能不能明天着
I've got a lot on my mind. Can we do this tomorrow?

342

-当然  -好的
- Sure. - Okay.

343
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,016
我就告诉杰克斯先生你现在没空就是了
I'll just tell Mr Jacks that you don't have the time right now.

344

-也许他可以告诉我  -不  不  我来吧
- Maybe he can tell me. - No, no! Okay, I'll do it.

345
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,187
好的
Okay.

346
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,692
我们之前看到抵押贷款须知
We were going over the asset-based lending guidelines.

347
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:26,061
是
Right.

348
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:28,135
我们假设你的客户是一家公司
Let's say your client is a company

349
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:30,758
但通过传统方式得不到银行资助
That can't get traditional bank financing.

350
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,277
-并且  -并且...

-我来帮你  -不用 不用  我自己能行
- Let me help you. - No, no, I've got it under control.

358
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,475
天啊  天啊
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

359

有没有溅到我嘴里
Did I get any in my mouth? 

363
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:32,492
我带您到那边清理一下吧
Let me take you over here to get clean.

364
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,930
实在对不起  天啊
I'm so sorry! Oh, my god!

365
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:38,663

有事吗
What is it?

368
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:43,392
你好  我来找西尔维亚・加纳什  她在吗
Hi. I came to see Sylvia ganush. Is she here?

369
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,525
你是谁
Who are you?

370
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,998

371
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,403
-一个...  -等一下
- Someone... - Wait.

372
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:58,246
我知道你是谁了  奶奶告诉过我你会来
I know who you are. Grandma told me you would come.

373
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:01,850
你就是银行那个夺走她房子的
You are the woman from the bank, the one who took her house.

374
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,683
事实上  是银行拿走了房子
Actually, it was the bank that took the house.

375
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,916
我是说  我只负责在那工作

In fact, I tried to help your grandma get the house back,

377
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,419
但老板就是不同意
But my boss wouldn't let me.

378
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,261
你就这样站在我门口跟我撒谎
Are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face?

379
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:25,275
-没有  -你以前很胖  是不是
- No. - You used to be a real fat girl, didn't you?

380
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,077
-是的  -我能看出来
- Yeah. - I can tell.

381
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,054
我们不欢迎你来这
You are not welcome here.

382
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,790
等等  我想见见她
Wait! wait. I need to see her.

I need her to forgive me. And I'll get her the house back.

384
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,064
你会帮她摆平一切  是吗
And you are gonna make everything all right for her, is that it?

385
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,292

-把她移开  把她移开  -快  别看
- Get her off me! Get her off me! - Come! Don't look.

-抓住她的肩膀  -用点力  把她举起来
- Grab her shoulder. - Be a man! Lift her up!

Still going to make everything all right for her?

392
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:27,188
你活该
You deserve everything that is coming to you.

393
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:34,731
-再来一次
- One more time!

394
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,334
我相信折磨你的是个女妖
I believe what plagues you is the lamia.

395
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,674
女妖  那个老女人就是这么喊的
Lamia, that's the word the old woman used.

396
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:44,738
这个恶魔  只听吉普赛人的召唤做坏事
The black goat, only summoned by gypsies for their darkest deeds.

397
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,056
头三天
For the first three days,

398
00:44:47,056 --> 00:44:51,011
女妖以凶灵的形象出现  慢慢折磨你
The lamia appears as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.

399
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:54,024
然后  她会把你的灵魂带走
After that, it reveals itself to be a taker of souls,

400
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,526
她会来找那个被诅咒物的所有者
And it comes for the owner of the accursed object.

401
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:58,084
被诅咒物  什么东西
Accursed object. What object?

402
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,597
从受害者身上拿的东西  下咒后  又还回的
Something taken from the victim, cursed and given back.

403
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:06,900
这个
This?

404
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:10,268
我把它烧了呢
What if I just burn it?

405
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:13,434
不管这个扣子怎么样
I'm afraid no matter what condition the button is in,

406
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:17,437
你还是所有者  女妖同样会来带你走
You would still be the owner. The lamia would still come to take you.

407
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:19,243
带我去哪
Take me where?

408
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:30,223
-我怎么才能避免  -你可以试着安抚她
- Then how do I get rid of this? - You could attempt to appease the spirit.

409
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:32,229
最简单的方式就是供奉血淋淋的祭品
The simplest way would be a blood offering.

410
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:36,233
可以用一些小动物  或者鸡也行
A small creature could be sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.

411
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:38,394
不行  听着  我是一个素食主义者
No way! Look, I'm a vegetarian.

412
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,405
天呢  我还在动物保护所当志愿者
I volunteer at the puppy shelter, for christ's sake.

413
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:43,566
我是不会杀生的
I don't go around killing animals.

414
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,575
到时候你就知道你会不会了
You will be surprised what you'll be willing to do

415
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,804
当女妖找上门时
When the lamia comes for you.

416
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,139
这本书可以教你怎么做
This will show you how.

417
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:58,156
过来  猫咪  猫咪
Here, kitty, kitty.

418
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:21,548
克莉丝  克莉丝
Chris! Chris?

419
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:24,483
克莉丝
Chris?

420
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,091
嗨  你在这啊  你在这干嘛呢
Hey, there you are. What are you doing out here?

421
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,854
宝贝  我打电话到银行  他们说你早走了
Baby, I called the bank. They said you left early.

422
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:34,420
你也没接我电话  那是血吗
You're not answering my calls. Is that blood?

423
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,830
不是  怎么会有血呢
No. why would there be blood?

424
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:42,873
是啊  宝贝  那...那有血  在你袖子上
Yeah, baby, there's... there's blood on your sleeve.

425
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,999
-你在流血吗  -没有
- Are you bleeding? - No.

426
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:46,870
那只是番茄汁
It was just tomato juice.

427
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:48,774
我刚才在切番茄
I was cutting a tomato in the

428
00:50:48,774 --> 00:50:51,677
可能一不小心溅上来了
Kitchen and it must have gotten on my sleeve.

429
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:58,087
克莉丝  要不我们改天吃晚饭吧
Hey, chris, why don't we do this dinner another time?

430
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:01,618
你这几天过的太难了  我觉得是最好还是
You've had a rough couple of days. I think it's better.

431
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,785
没事  我想去
No, I want to go to the dinner.

432
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:07,228
我知道  但是你确定你没事吗
I know, but are you sure you're feeling all right?

433
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:11,365
说实话  过去几天确实不顺
Honestly, I haven't been.

434
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,200
但是我觉得...
But I think...

435
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:22,445
我现在觉得一切都好了
I think that everything is gonna be okay now.

436
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:25,909
真的
I really do.

437
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:32,449
怎么样
What do you think?

438
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,823
你看起来太漂亮了
You look beautiful.

439
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:44,562
真的  天啊
It really is. My god.

440
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,899
里面也很漂亮
It's gonna be nice inside, too.

441
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,474
他们会喜欢你的
They're gonna love you.

442
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:55,837
-克莱顿  -妈妈
- Clayton. - Hello, mother.

443
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,175
见到你真高兴  这是克莉丝汀
Good to see you. This is Christine.

444
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,272
-这是我母亲  特鲁迪  -你好  克莉丝汀
- That's my mom, Trudy. - Hello, Christine.

445
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,443
你好  很高心见到你
Hello. It's very nice to meet you.

446
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:04,254
-哦  -请进  请进
- Well. - Please, come in. Come in.

447
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:05,414
好
Yes.

448
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:07,119
-老爸  最近过的怎么样  -嗨  儿子
- Hey, Dad, how are you? - Hey, son.

449
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:08,920
伯父  很高兴见到您
Good to see you, sir.

450
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,756
这是克莉丝汀  这是我爸爸  莱昂纳德
This is Christine. Christine, this is my dad, Leonard.

451
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:11,920
-你好  -嗨 玛丽娅  谢谢
- Nice to meet you. - Hi, Maria. Thank you.

452
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:15,591
-你们家真漂亮  -谢谢
- You have a beautiful home. - Well, thank you very much.

453
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:17,925
-你要不要喝点什么  -要酒吗?
- Can I get you a drink? - Yeah, wine?

454
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:19,367
-你们要吗  -当然
- Do you guys want? - Sure.

455
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,270
-好的  过来帮我  -我一会回来
- Okay. Come help me. - I'll be right back.

456
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,166
好的  亲爱的
Yes, dear.

457
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:29,807
-希望你不要太介意  -太客气了
- I hope you don't mind. - How thoughtful.

458
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:31,542
-自己做的  -是的
- Homemade? - Yes.

459
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,447
你们管这种蛋糕叫什么
And what type of cake would you call that?

460
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,510
我们叫它
It's called

461
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:38,950
丰收蛋糕
A harvest cake.

462
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:42,117
你们是不是在农场上经常做啊
Is that something you would make on a farm?

463
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:44,221
不
No.

464
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:52,130
现在不了  我们过去还有一群鹅时常做
I mean, not any more. We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.

465
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,865
-鹅?  -就是在快到收获季节的时候
- Geese? - Well, right around the harvest time,

466
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:58,066
也就是下鹅蛋时
That's when your goose eggs will make a real dense yolk.

467
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,634
鹅蛋黄可以用来做大蛋糕
It makes for a rich cake.

468
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:04,882
哦  非常感谢
Well, just thank you.

469
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:08,215
-我们来了  -对不起打断你们的谈话
- Here we are. - Sorry to interrupt the bonding sesh.

470
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,513
-到宴厅来吧  -好的
- Why don't you join us in the dining room? - Good.

471
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:12,317
-好  我们走  就在那边  -好的
- Yeah, let's go. It's right in here. - Okay.

472
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,416
-天啊  -赫库巴
- Jeez. - Hecuba.

473
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:19,089
我从来就不了解那只该死的猫  我讨厌猫
I never did understand that damned animal. I hate cats.

474
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:22,826
真奇怪  赫库巴通常很乖的
That is so strange. Hecuba is usually very sweet.

475
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,733
没关系  我也曾有只猫  我能理解
That's okay. I had a cat. I understand.

476
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,895
你是说...你是说你现在养的那只猫吧
You mean... you mean you have a cat.

477
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:31,505
什么意思  那只猫怎么了
What do you mean? Did something happen?

478
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,601
是不是发生什么事了
Unless something happened to him.

479
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,441
我怎么会知道呢
Well, how am I supposed to know?

480
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:42,012
我是说  你也知道  猫总喜欢跑来跑去
I mean, you know how cats are. They come and they go.

481
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:46,680
是啊
That's true.

482
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:51,961
-你要不要...  -哦...是的  谢谢
- Well, should... - Well... yes. Yes, please.

483
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,960
儿子  古币收集的怎么样了
So, how's the coin collection, son?

484
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,933
我老爸通常会问"你还是个收集狂"
That's my dad's way of saying, "so, you're still a huge nerd?"

485
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,367
还好  事实上  克莉丝汀刚刚给我了一个
It's good. It's good. In fact, Christine just got me

486
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,406
1929年纪念自由女神站立像的硬币呢
A 1929 standing liberty quarter at her bank.

487
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:04,532
-真的吗  -太不可思议了吧  那硬币很少见
- Really? - Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.

488
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:07,908
我猜当一名银行出纳员肯定很难了
I just think the job of a bank teller must be so difficult,

489
00:54:07,979 --> 00:54:11,642
天天计算  重复  肯定很烦人
With all that counting and repetition. It must get very tedious.

490
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:12,943
是的  你说的对
Yes, you're right,

491
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:15,214
-但我不是出纳员  -哦
- But I'm not a teller. - Oh?

492
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:17,083
是啊  妈妈  我告诉过你  克莉丝汀是放贷人
Yeah, mom, I told you. Christine's a loan officer.

493
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:20,487
她们银行所有小型经商和家庭贷款都归她管
She handles all the loans for small businesses and homes for her bank.

494
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:24,118
而且她最近要提升了  所以...对吗  克莉丝
And she's up for this big promotion, so... right, Chris?

495
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,434
如果我能把手头处理的一笔贷款业务结清了
If I could close this one account that I'm working on,

496
00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:27,391
说不定就可以得到提拔了
It would really help.

497
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,558
那笔贷款肯定很重要
That must be a very important loan.

498
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:32,467
是啊  那是我们银行处理过的最大数目的
It's the biggest that my branch has ever handled.

499
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,731
你怎么接手这笔贷款的
And how did that come to you?

500
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:37,233
哦  我当时在读华尔街报
Well, I was reading the wall street journal

501
00:54:37,308 --> 00:54:39,606
看到这家药材供应公司
And came across this medical supply company

502
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:43,113
打算扩张  但是没有足够的流动资金
That was looking to expand but didn't have the liquidity.

503
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,081
所以我就去见了他们总裁  提出了一套方案
So I met with their CEO and presented a formula

504
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,914
来帮助他们申请长期贷款
For restructuring some of their long-term debt.

505
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:51,580
克莉丝汀  看来你做的不错啊
Sounds like you've got a lot going for you, Christine.

506
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:54,523
你母亲肯定会为你感到自豪
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.

507
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,158
可能吧
I suppose.

508
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,101
我不太经常跟我妈妈见面
I don't see much of my mother.

509
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:07,365
-为什么  -哦  妈妈  那...那是人家的私事
- Why is that? - Wow, mom, that's... it's kind of personal.

510
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,530
我在跟克莉丝汀说话
I'm speaking to Christine.

511
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:18,145
自从我爸爸去世后  她就不怎么爱说话了
Well, ever since my dad died, she doesn't talk much.

512
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:24,987
一直待在农场上  自娱自乐  沉醉于...
She just stays on the farm and keeps to herself because...

513
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,791
沉醉于什么
Because?

514
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:31,624
因为她丈夫去世了  妈妈  所以她想一个人过
Because her husband died, mom, and she just wants to be by herself.

515
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,790
-为什么不...  -因为我妈妈嗜酒如命
- Why don't... - Because my mother's an alcoholic.

516
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,524
哦
Oh.

517
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,526
对不起
I'm sorry.

518
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:44,302
这也不是什么丢人的事
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

519
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:48,240
反而我觉得  你的诚实很令人佩服
I have to say, I find your honesty very refreshing.

520
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:50,568
我父亲曾经也是经常酗酒
My father had a drinking problem,

521
00:55:50,568 --> 00:55:52,479
但我从来都不敢承认
And I was always too ashamed to admit it.

522
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:55,583
你比较有勇气
You've got backbone.

523
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:57,982
不像上次他带回来的那个女孩
Unlike that last girl he brought by.

524
00:55:58,055 --> 00:55:59,647
-她叫什么来着  -艾丽丝
- What was her name? - Alice.

525
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:01,248
-我们没必要...  -艾丽莎
- We don't have to... - Alicia!

526
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,486
-艾丽莎  -克莉丝汀  你不知道  那个女生太可怕了
- Alicia. - She was dreadful, Christine.

527
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:06,655
显得有点病怏怏的  而且一点理想都没有
She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.

528
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:07,857
那其实不太算是...  -他们是在网上认识的
That's not really... - They met on the internet.

529
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:09,024
那是什么
What is that,

530
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,158
你不知道
Really?

531
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:12,498
-什么意思  -我对他太严厉了吗
- What does that mean? - Am I being too hard on him?

532
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,594
没有  一点都不会
No, not at all.

533
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,035
谢谢
Thanks a lot...

534
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,767
我觉得我应该尝尝你们带来的蛋糕
You know, I think I will try some of that cake of yours.

535
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,205
看啊  看起来真不错
Look at that. It looks great.

536
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,240
看起来很有趣
It looks so interesting.

537
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:25,713
你如果不喜欢  就只能说你有审美问题
You only dislike it if you hate delicious things.

538
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:29,342
不是我的问题
Not my problem.

539
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,745
真可爱
Lovely.

540
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:33,346
谢谢你  克莉丝汀  太棒了
Thank you, Christine. This is wonderful.

541
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:35,255
而且刚好用来转移话题
It also changed the subject nicely.

542
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,088
谢谢  看起来很好吃
Thank you. That looks good!

543
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:39,552
是啊
That's right.

544
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,030
这真的做的很精致  是不是
It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?

545
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,930
你有没有听到什么动静啊
Did you hear something?

546
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:46,029
没有  你还好吧
No. You okay?

547
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:47,864
真好吃
Tasty!

548
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,607
-我很喜欢  -我确实喜欢
- I like it a lot. - I do like it.

549
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:53,957
妈妈  刚才你说我们是在网上认识的
You know, mom, when you say we met on the internet,

550
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:55,405
可能容易让人误解
It's a little misleading.

551
00:57:13,831 --> 00:57:16,561
当然为了找个好伴侣那样做也无可厚非
Yes, well you need to do that to find a good mate.

552
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:18,158
但是你不能相信
You can't even trust

553
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,396
诸如你听到的或者别人写在网上的自我介绍
The things you hear or that people write about themselves.

554
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:22,496
-很好  -甚至连照片多数都是假的
- Very nice. - Even the pictures are false half the time.

555
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:23,800
这是真的
It's true.

556
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,933
我不觉得这算是一种误解
I don't think it's a misconception

557
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,637
那些有良好教养
To think that people of good breeding

558
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:29,444
并且成功的人应该
And success should be able to meet

559
00:57:29,444 --> 00:57:31,943
在现实生活中寻找人生伴侣
Potential life partners in a realistic situation.

560
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:33,608
还有  别老是逛酒吧
Well, you also have a thing about bars.

561
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,023
你经常去吗  克莉丝汀
Would you, Christine?

562
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:52,165
-不  当然不去  -什么  但我们去的啊
- No, no, of course not. - What? What... but we did.

563
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,134
克莉丝  我们是在酒吧认识的啊  你怎么了
We met at a bar, Chris. What are you talking about?

564
00:57:54,205 --> 00:57:56,002
她...
She...

565
00:57:56,106 --> 00:58:00,509
那不是三K党聚会的地方  妈妈  就是个酒吧
It's not a klan rally, mom. It's a bar.

566
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:04,246
对  我们  我们在酒吧邂逅
Yeah, we met... we met at a bar, 

567
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,651
从网上联系开始约会的
And we set up the date on the internet.

568
00:58:07,618 --> 00:58:10,644
你没事吧
You okay? You okay?

569
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:15,483
喝点水  宝贝  喝点...  噎着了
Some water? Baby, have some... went down the wrong pipe.

570
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,791
天呢
Oh, my god!

571
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,141
对不起  我没有...  是不是有窗户开着
I'm sorry, I don't... there must be a window open.

572
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:34,504
克莉丝
Chris?

573
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,714
见鬼  我能听见你
Okay, I hear you!

574
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:42,308
你在地狱吗  -离我远点
What in the hell? - Leave me alone.

575
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:44,819
-听见吗  离我远点  -克莉丝  别这样
- Just leave me the hell alone! - Hey! Hey! Chris! Stop it!

576
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:47,015
宝贝  那里没人
Baby! There's no one there.

577
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,752
好吧
Okay.

578
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:56,430
-我觉得我应该走了  -是啊  我觉得也是
- I think I'd better go. - Yes, I think that would be best.

579
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:58,775
我知道  等一下  克莉丝...
I know. Wait, Chris...

580
00:58:58,776 --> 00:59:02,028
别跟着她  那个女孩有病
Don't follow her! She's a sick girl.

581
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:03,539
-妈妈  她需要帮助  -让她走吧
- Mom, she needs my help. - Let her go.

582
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:06,834
等等
Wait!

583
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,945
怎么了
What's the matter?

584
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:14,440
听着  我听你的杀了那只猫
Look, I did what you said! I killed that little kitty!

585
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,716
你满嘴胡话
You're so full of shit!

586
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:19,585
你要知道我们面对是一股强大的黑暗势力
These are elusive and powerful forces we are dealing with.

587
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,624
没有任何保证能一定成功
There are no guarantees.

588
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:42,044
我们必须直接跟这恶灵谈话
We must speak directly to this dark spirit.

589
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,311
我们必须劝止她抓走你的灵魂  尽快
We must dissuade it from taking your soul, and soon.

590
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:51,386
-我知道有人可以帮我们  -我该不该相信你
- I know someone who can help us. - And I'm supposed to trust you?

591
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:55,549
明天就是第三天了  之后  女妖就来抓你了
Tomorrow is the third day. After that, the lamia will come for you.

592
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,822
我们不能让她得逞  但你必须要明白
We can't let that happen. But you must understand,

593
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:03,492
帮我们的那个女人  自己也会身陷绝境
The woman who can help us must put herself at great risk.

594
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:07,326
-她是不会免费为你做的  -你想我怎样
- She will not do that for free. - What do you need from me?

595
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,901
一万美金
$10,000 cash

596
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:12,670
明天前准备好
By tomorrow.

597
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,919
-杰克斯先生  -什么事
- Mr Jacks. - Yeah?

598
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:32,859
问这挺难为情的  我知道正式任命还没下来
This is kind of awkward for me, and I know it's not official yet,

599
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:37,628
但我能不能预支我新职位的薪资
But I was wondering if I could get an advance for the new position.

600
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,931
副经理的职位吗
What, the assistant manager's position?

601
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:43,268
对  我有位家庭成员病得很厉害
Yes. See, one of my family members is really sick.

602
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:47,768
-他们虽不至于死  但也很危险  -克莉丝汀
- They're not gonna die, but they could. - Christine. Christine.

603
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:52,508
出了件事  麦克弗森那买卖昨晚被取消了
There's a problem. The Mcpherson deal was cancelled last night.

604
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:54,049
-什么  -对
- What? - Yeah.

605
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:56,414
我跟区域办公室刚说完
Right after I informed the regional

606
01:00:56,414 --> 01:00:58,449
我们有一笔大贷款项目
Office that we had this big loan pending,

607
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:02,047
我就发现他们跟我们的对手成交了
I find out that they just made their deal over at first national.

608
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,024
现在  我要找人来问问怎么回事
Now, I gotta call in to see what exactly happened,

609
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:08,064
目前为止  这事对你对我来说都不太好
But right now, this does not look too good for you or for me.

610
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:13,899
所以  副经理的职位先放一放
So, this assistant manager promotion has been delayed.

611
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,974
说实话  就目前发生的每件事
In fact, you know, I think, with everything that's been happening,

612
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:21,238
我想得把这份工作交给斯图
I think I'm gonna have to give this job to Stu.

613
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:23,909
斯图  我明白了
Stu. I see.

614
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:27,644
很抱歉  若是家里出了问题
I'm sorry. Look, if you've got family problems,

615
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:31,243
或许你该请几天假  解决之后...
Maybe you should take the day off, sort them out and...

616
01:02:29,823 --> 01:02:35,486
当铺

617
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:42,486
-多少钱  -总共3800元
- So, how much? - $3,800 for everything.

618
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:45,459
-我的首饰算了吗  -算了
- Including my jewellery? - Including.

619
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:48,429
这些东西肯定不止这个价
But this Stuff is worth so much more than that.

620
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:52,731
拜托  这是我的全部财产  我求求你
Please. This is all I have. I'm begging you.

621
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:55,901
要不要随你的便
Take it or leave it.

622
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:06,346
克莉丝  克莉丝
Chris? Chris?

623
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,013
宝贝
Baby?

624
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,869
我以为你有乳糖不耐症
I thought you were lactose intolerant.

625
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,371
对
I am.

626
01:03:36,547 --> 01:03:39,778
不过我想  管他呢  我就要吃冰激凌
But then I thought, "screw it, I'm eating ice cream."

627
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,714
我把钱给拉姆・加斯了
I paid Rham Jas.

628
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:51,217
什么  没开玩笑吧
What? You're kidding me.

629
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:53,620
我付钱给他
I paid him.

630
01:03:54,698 --> 01:03:57,724
为什么  我以为你不信那个的
Why? I mean, I thought that you didn't believe.

631
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:01,194
我也不知道什么该信什么不该信
I don't know what I believe in any more.

632
01:04:01,305 --> 01:04:05,071
我不信  但我知道你信
I really don't, but I know that you believe in this.

633
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,837
而且这对你来说很重要
I know how important it is to you,

634
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:11,312
为这你遭了很大的罪
And I know how much pain this is causing you.

635
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:16,478
我还记得
And, I also remembered...

636
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,984
我爱上你的那个晚上
I remembered a promise that I made

637
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:23,423
我曾做出承诺
The night I fell in love with you.

638
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,755
我跟自己说
I told myself that I would...

639
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:30,432
我会一辈子呵护你  照顾你
I would always look out for you. I'd always take care of you.

640
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:33,759
所以我付钱给他了
So I paid him.

641
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,773
你还记得爱上我的那个晚上
You remember the night that you fell in love with me?

642
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,902
第二个晚上也记得呢
I remember the second I fell in love with you.

643
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:46,014
天呀
Oh, my god.

644
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:01,359
确定不用我跟你进去吗
You sure you don't want me to go in with you?

645
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:02,898
他说我要独自面对
He said I should come alone.

646
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:06,299
我知道  他也跟我说了
Yeah, I know, I know he did. He told me the same thing.

647
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:44,334
克莉丝汀
Christine, if you will permit me

648
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:47,637
请允许我介绍  肖恩珊蒂娜
The pleasure of an introduction, Shaun San Dena.

649
01:05:51,014 --> 01:05:53,574
-幸会  -你好吗
- Welcome. - How do you do?

650
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:56,748
肖恩珊蒂娜是经验丰富的灵媒师
Shaun San Denais an experienced medium.

651
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:59,947
并且  她曾与那个女妖打过交道
Furthermore, she's personally been touched by the Lamia.

652
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:04,517
多年前  就在这间屋子里我见过它
I first encountered this spirit many years ago in this very house.

653
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:07,523
当时是怎么回事
And what happened?

654
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,434
一个男孩的灵魂被它抢走了
I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.

655
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:23,642
我苦守了这么多年
I have waited these long years

656
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:28,207
等待时机救赎自己
For a chance at redeeming myself,

657
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:31,847
斩妖除魔
A chance to destroy the foul thing.

658
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:42,538
今晚  我的机会来了
Tonight, my chance will come.

659
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:47,730
我需要你来引诱她
But to summon it, I will need your help.

660
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:50,867
你敢吗
Can you be strong?

661
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:54,908
我试试
I'll try.

662
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:03,246
我前夫桑德尔  也是灵媒师
My late husband, Sandor, was also medium.

663
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:05,754
他把房子建在这儿
He chose this site to build a house upon

664
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:09,757
因为他认为这地方存在某种力量
Because he sensed certain forces at work here.

665
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:14,419
这地方  有种特殊的...
In this place, there is a particular...

666
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:24,763
一种特殊的能量结界
A particular confluence of forces

667
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:28,036
可以打开一扇门
Which allows a doorway to be opened through which we may pass...

668
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:36,381
阳间与阴间的通道
...and through which others may pass into our world.

669
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,786
请坐
Please be seated.

670
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:13,146
怎么回事
What's going on?

671
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,890
我们做的每件事都是为你好
Everything we're doing is for your own good.

672
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:19,991
没事的  克莉丝汀  请坐
Please. Christine, please.

673
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,932
谢谢
Thank you.

674
01:08:55,866 --> 01:08:59,859
我被魂灵附体时  把我的手放在羊身上
Once the spirit has entered me, put my hand upon the animal.

675
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,030
-明白吗  -好
- Do you understand? - Yes.

676
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:07,197
我会把女妖魂灵逼到山羊身上
I force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat.

677
01:09:07,197 --> 01:09:09,703
米洛斯  到时候出剑
Milos, that's when you strike.

678
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:14,206
明白
I understand.

679
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,153
大家都要请灵
We all must be receptive.

680
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:45,912
-我该做些什么  -你得让黑暗进来
- What am I supposed to do? - You must allow the darkness in.

681
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:49,678
引导幽灵进入自己的灵魂里
You must invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit.

682
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:52,715
-我很怕  -是的
- I'm scared. - Yes.

683
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:57,588
重复这句话  迎接死灵至吾魂魄
Now repeat these words, "I welcome the dead into my soul."

684
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:05,556
-迎接死灵至吾魂魄   -一定要虔诚
- I welcome the dead into my soul. - You must believe it!

685
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:08,702
迎接死灵至吾魂魄
I welcome the dead into my soul.

686
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:13,335
-迎接死灵至吾魂魄  -迎接死灵至吾魂魄
- I welcome the dead into my soul. - I welcome the dead into my soul.

687
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:16,871
-迎接死灵至吾魂魄   -至吾魂魄
- I welcome the dead into my soul. - ...into my soul.

688
01:10:18,114 --> 01:10:23,518
迎接死灵至吾魂魄  迎接死灵至吾魂魄
I welcome the dead into my soul. I welcome the dead into my soul.

689
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:33,062
迎接死灵至吾魂魄
I welcome the dead into my soul.

690
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:34,357
迎接死灵至...
I welcome the dead...

691
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:42,769
迎接死灵至吾魂魄
I welcome the dead into my soul.

692
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:44,396
迎接死灵至吾...
I welcome the dead into...

693
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:50,276
周围有其他魂魄
Something else is here with us.

694
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:52,973
是的
Yes.

695
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:23,579
不是女妖
This is not the Lamia.

696
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:26,912
是一些...
It is the spirit of some

697
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:30,951
多年不得超生的怨灵
Unsettled soul from years ago.

698
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:34,981
有时这些游魂会在门周围游荡
Sometimes the unsettled ones linger by the door.

699
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:38,754
还有其它的魂魄
There are others here, as well.

700
01:11:49,005 --> 01:11:51,940
走开  愚蠢的野鬼  走开
Begone, foolish spirits! Begone!

701
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,055
她来了
She is coming.

702
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:53,160
肖恩珊蒂娜里面是谁
Who now inhabits the body of Shaun San Dena?

703
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,394
女妖
Lamia!

704
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:08,568
女妖  你渴求什么
Lamia, what is it you desire?

705
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:12,979
我渴求克莉丝汀的灵魂
I desire the soul of Christine Brown!

706
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:16,946
就等她一进坟墓  我们就把她吃光
We will feast upon it as she festers in the grave!

707
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,580
不是我干的  是我们经理吉姆・杰克斯
No! It was my manager, Jim Jacks!

708
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,521
- 他才是  他...-闭嘴
- He was the one! He was... - Silence!

709
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:25,856
女妖  你肯定能放弃这位无关紧要的灵魂
Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded from taking this insignificant woman.

710
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,863
她肯定不值得你大费周章
Surely she is not worthy of your greatness.

711
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:39,106
不
No!

712
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:46,513
我为你来的  克莉丝汀
I come for you, Christine.

713
01:14:48,718 --> 01:14:50,276
你是我的
You're mine!

714
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:56,720
不
No!

715
01:14:56,893 --> 01:15:00,693
你阴我  邪恶的贱人
You tricked me! You black-hearted whore!

716
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:03,357
-米洛斯 快  -婊子
- Now, Milos, now! - You bitch.

717
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:18,646
走开  不洁的灵魂
Away, unclean spirit.

718
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:36,062
女妖
Lamia!

719
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:38,463
吾  唤汝入人间者
As one who summoned you to this circle,

720
01:15:38,463 --> 01:15:40,761
命令汝即退人间
I command you to leave this instant.

721
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,700
克莉丝汀
Christine!

722
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:59,879
我不稀罕你的猫  你这臭婊子
I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!

723
01:16:11,301 --> 01:16:12,928
肖恩珊蒂娜
Shaun san dena!

724
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,871
驱赶恶灵
You must banish the spirit!

725
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:17,063
好
Yes!

726
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:50,734
米洛斯
Milos!

727
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:55,408
-我的天  我还好  -谢天谢地
- Oh, my god. I'm okay. - Thank god!

728
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:57,412
-还活着  -难以置信
- I'm okay. - Unbelievable!

729
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:02,007
-你做到了  -谢天谢地
- You did it! - Thank god.

730
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:05,518
我尽力了
I tried.

731
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:06,646
你还好吗
Are you okay?

732
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:09,254
天呢  帮帮忙
Oh, my god. Help me!

733
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,926
叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

734
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:21,429
她有气吗
Is she breathing?

735
01:17:23,006 --> 01:17:24,530
没
No.

736
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:28,941
天呢
Oh, my gosh.

737
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,911
-太让人伤心了  -是的
- It's so sad. - Yes.

738
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:15,821
怎么会这样
Strange how things work out.

739
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:19,851
她等了40年  就为除掉女妖
She waited 40 years for another chance to overcome the Lamia,

740
01:18:21,597 --> 01:18:26,227
最后  生前最后一晚  她成功了
And finally, on the last night of her life, she did.

741
01:18:27,103 --> 01:18:29,663
不  恐怕你搞错了
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

742
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:33,774
灵媒师是消灭不了女妖的
The Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.

743
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,179
今晚失败了  抱歉
This is our lesson tonight. I'm sorry.

744
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:39,180
-但我看见她除掉那家伙了  -没有
- But I saw her get rid of the thing. - No.

745
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:42,547
它不过是被驱赶走了
You saw her drive it. That is all.

746
01:18:43,252 --> 01:18:46,278
它还会回来的  山羊从没被斩尽杀绝的
It will be back. The goat was never slaughtered.

747
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,217
今晚一过
When this night is through,

748
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:53,689
女妖就会出来寻求被咒物的主人
The Lamia will come for the owner of the accursed object.

749
01:18:57,366 --> 01:19:02,133
除非  你不再是主人  你那枚纽扣呢
Unless, of course, you are no longer the owner. Do you have the button?

750
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:13,710
把它送人  你的诅咒就解除了
Make a gift of it and you've given the curse away.

751
01:19:17,386 --> 01:19:19,081
为何之前你不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me this before?

752
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:22,716
因为女妖会撕裂你给的那个人的灵魂
Because the Lamia will tear the soul out of whoever you give that to.

753
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:25,317
他们永世不得超生
They'll burn in hell for eternity.

754
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:30,156
是我把他们送去的
And I would have sent them there.

755
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:33,065
我是你的帮凶
And I would be your accomplice.

756
01:19:34,637 --> 01:19:38,403
在天亮之前你要做出决定
Whatever you decide, you have till morning.

757
01:19:59,529 --> 01:20:00,860
好了吗
Is it over?

758
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:03,529
好了
It's over.

759
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:08,496
克莱!
Clay!

760
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:15,010
我咒你下地狱
You will burn in hell!

761
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:20,042
我咒你下地狱  婊子我咒你下地狱
You will burn in hell! You bitch, you'll burn in hell!

762
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,347
你的死期到了
Your turn's coming!

763
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:25,319
-我咒你下地狱  -还好吗
- You will burn in hell! - You okay?

764
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:27,854
见鬼了
Holy shit.

765
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:44,062
好吧  你确定你还能去圣巴巴拉吗
Okay, you sure you're still okay about the santa barbara trip?

766
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:45,231
-是的  我没事  -真的吗
- Yeah, I'm fine. - Yeah?

767
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,954
我什么时候接你
And what time should I get you?

768
01:20:46,954 --> 01:20:49,243
我和你在车站碰头吧
It's better if I meet you at the station.

769
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:50,845
路上我有点事要办
There's something i've gotta do on the way.

770
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:53,006
我帮你办  来的路上我...
I can do it. You want me to do it on my way to...

771
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:55,516
不要  我自己能行
No! No. I've got it under control.

772
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:59,086
-那么7:30在...  -啊  我的信封呢
- We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the... - Wait! Where's my envelope?

773
01:20:59,222 --> 01:21:01,690
-什么信封  -在我钱包里  我刚还拿着的
- What envelope? - It was in my purse. I just had it!

774
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:03,850
-不过是一枚信封  -不  应该在这里的
- It's just an envelope. - No, it's gotta be here!

775
01:21:03,926 --> 01:21:06,861
在这呢  终于找到了
It's here, so we'll find it eventually.

776
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:08,861
-我的天呀  -是啊
- Oh, my god. - Okay.

777
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:11,593
我以为弄丢了呢  这下好了
I thought I'd lost it. Okay.

778
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:14,926
再见  7:30  别迟到啦
Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.

779
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:35,446
爸爸  我们去玩天使游戏好不
Dad, can we go to the angel game?

780
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:39,587
去看道格队的比赛怎么样
What about the dodgers?

781
01:21:39,588 --> 01:21:40,588
我们只能在城里待几天
We're only gonna be in town for a few days.

782
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:45,629
我确定要是告诉他我有多在乎你
I'm sure if I just tell him how much I care about you,

783
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:48,066
他会理解的
I mean, he's gotta understand.

784
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:54,071
您确定不想要别的吗
Are you sure you don't want anything else?

785
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:55,132
不要
No.

786
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:58,406
那你要整晚坐在这儿喝咖啡啊
So you're just gonna sit here drinking coffee all night long.

787
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:01,746
可能吧  这跟你有什么关系
Yes. Maybe! What's it to you?

788
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:06,049
美女  我是靠小费赚钱的  喝咖啡的没小费
Honey, I make my money on tips. Coffee drinkers don't tip.

789
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:06,415
美女
Honey,

790
01:22:06,415 --> 01:22:10,057
只管送咖啡  否则我把这个给你  折磨死你
Just keep the coffee coming or i'll give you a tip you won't forget.

791
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:55,598
天啊  真是太棒的惊喜了
Oh, my gosh. What a delightful surprise.

792
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:59,269
你真是世界上最好的人
You're the sweetest person in the world.

793
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:03,605
以前的事我过往不计  斯图
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

794
01:23:03,713 --> 01:23:05,681
10分钟马上出现  否则我跟经理说
Just get here in 10 minutes or I'm gonna tell mr Jacks

795
01:23:05,781 --> 01:23:07,976
你不想让他知道的事
Something you don't want me to tell him.

796
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,382
是吗  比如说
Oh, yeah? Like what?

797
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,451
第一  从我这偷了麦克弗森贷款文件
Well, for starters, that you stole the Mcpherson loan file off my desk

798
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:17,890
交给竞争对手  现在你只剩下9分钟
And gave it to First National. Now you got nine minutes!

799
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:25,060
-续杯  -真的吗
- Give me another. - Seriously?

800
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,971
克莉丝汀  拜托别告发我
Oh, god, Christine, please don't tell on me.

801
01:23:35,971 --> 01:23:38,176
要是被我爸发现了...
I mean, if my dad ever finds out...

802
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:41,546
-你想要什么  -我要给你一件东西
- Just tell me what you want. - I need to give something to you.

803
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:43,743
-一件小礼物  -礼物?
- A little gift. - A gift?

804
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,519
我不明白  我以为你叫我到这来
But I don't understand. I thought you called me down here

805
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,490
因为我把贷款交给竞争对手
Because I gave that loan to first national...

806
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:52,720
你不用明白  闭上你的臭嘴
Look, you don't need to understand. Just shut up!

807
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:56,893
这份礼物我现在给你  它就是你的东西啦
Now, this gift that I'm giving you, it'll become your property.

808
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:59,593
你是它的主人  明白吗
You'll be the owner, all right?

809
01:24:02,438 --> 01:24:03,735
明白
Okay.

810
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:10,237
明白
Okay.

811
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:14,746
怎么啦
What?

812
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:17,243
当我啥也没说
Forget it.

813
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:20,748
但我想你把它给我  是想了结贷款那事的
But I thought you wanted to give it to me 'cause of the loan Stuff.

814
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:22,221
走吧
Just leave.

815
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:28,296
好吧  谢谢你  克莉丝汀
Okay. Thank you so much, Christine.

816
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:36,732
-你保证别告诉我爸  -滚
- But you're not gonna tell my dad, right? - Go!

817
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:37,898
好吧
Okay.

818
01:24:48,818 --> 01:24:50,809
谁该下地狱呢
Who does deserve this?

819
01:25:00,674 --> 01:25:02,767
死亡讣告

820
01:25:11,674 --> 01:25:13,767
这有可能吗
Well? Is it possible?

821
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:18,070
有些死者身上会带有吉普赛的咒语
There are gypsy blessings bestowed upon the dead.

822
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,273
他们把礼物送给死者
They give gifts to their departed

823
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:24,682
来讨好死灵  这样  魂魄得以不灭
To curry favour with the deceased's soul, for, truly, the soul never dies.

824
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:31,516
对  我相信你可以把诅咒加给一个过世的人
Yes. I do believe you can give the curse to someone who has passed on,

825
01:25:31,861 --> 01:25:33,519
但你必须举行正式的仪式
But you must make a formal gift

826
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:35,319
把受诅咒的东西作为礼物送给死者
Of the accursed object to the deceased.

827
01:25:35,431 --> 01:25:37,128
我还不止要这么做
I'll do better than that.

828
01:25:37,431 --> 01:25:39,128
我要把它塞进老妖怪的喉咙里
I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!

829
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:41,201
给她点厉害...
I'm gonna get some...

830
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:29,935
我把它还给你
I'm giving it back to you!

831
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,075
你要拿好这个
You're gonna take this thing.

832
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:38,109
你不是要吗
Are you gonna take this thing?

833
01:27:40,489 --> 01:27:42,047
拿着
Take it!

834
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:58,003
这是你最后一次抓我的头发
That's the last of my hair you're getting!

835
01:28:03,412 --> 01:28:09,442
我克莉丝汀 布朗特此将此受诅的纽扣
I, Christine Brown, do hereby make a formal gift of this button

836
01:28:09,518 --> 01:28:11,850
作为正式的礼物送给西尔维娅・加纳什
To you, Sylvia Ganush!

837
01:28:13,756 --> 01:28:15,690
噎死你  老妖怪
Choke on it, bitch!

838
01:28:30,706 --> 01:28:32,173
再见
Goodbye.

839
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:04,532
我是克莉丝汀  请留言稍后回您电话
Hi, it's Christine. Leave a message and I'll call you back.

840
01:30:05,267 --> 01:30:07,599
克莉丝汀  我是吉姆 杰克斯
Christine, it's Jim Jim Jacks.

841
01:30:07,703 --> 01:30:09,068
很抱歉这么早打给你
I'm sorry I'm calling so early,

842
01:30:09,138 --> 01:30:09,957
但昨天晚上
But last night,

843
01:30:09,957 --> 01:30:13,700
我发现斯图・鲁宾干得一些坏事
I found some troubling information about our friend Stu rubin.

844
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:17,434
显然  他偷了你的麦克弗森贷款文件
Apparently, he stole your file on the Mcpherson loan

845
01:30:17,546 --> 01:30:20,879
然后交给竞争对手企图自己捞一笔
And then tried to broker his own deal at first national.

846
01:30:20,949 --> 01:30:22,917
我猜他以为我们没查出来
I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.

847
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,647
本来也没查  但是1小时前
And we wouldn't have either, except that an hour ago,

848
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:29,554
他到我家  想把所有的过错都归咎于你
He came by my house and tried to pin the whole thing on you.

849
01:30:30,626 --> 01:30:34,153
我戳穿他自相矛盾的谎话之后
After I confronted him about a few inconsistencies in his story,

850
01:30:34,263 --> 01:30:38,632
他就歇斯底里个没完  我就把他炒了
He broke down crying and, well, we won't be seeing him around any more.

851
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,999
我想告诉你一声  周一早上来上班
So I just wanted you to know that, come monday morning,

852
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:46,836
副经理的位置非你莫属
That assistant manager's position will be waiting for you.

853
01:30:58,654 --> 01:31:01,088
班森乘客
Passenger Benson, please meet your party

854
01:31:01,156 --> 01:31:03,249

我们还没开门
We're not open yet.

862
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:38,216
我和男友今天的旅程将会非常特殊
My boyfriend and I are taking this really special trip this morning.

863
01:31:39,561 --> 01:31:40,653

864
01:31:43,499 --> 01:31:46,400

867
01:31:51,573 --> 01:31:54,064
宝贝抱抱
Hey! Oh, man! Have a body

868
01:31:54,176 --> 01:31:56,576
天啊  真高兴你来了  我有好多话要跟你说
God, I'm so glad you're here. So many things I wanna tell you.

869
01:31:56,712 --> 01:31:57,838

Wait, there's something I wanna say

870
01:31:57,913 --> 01:32:00,848

- While I have it straight in my head. - Okay. Go ahead.

871

你一直都相信我
You never stopped believing in me.

872
01:32:04,219 --> 01:32:05,914
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

873
01:32:07,222 --> 01:32:11,750
还有些事  我以前不承认
And there's something else, something that I couldn't admit to before.

874
01:32:12,427 --> 01:32:17,364
我本可以延长加纳什夫人的贷款  但我没有
I could have given mrs Ganush another extension on her loan, but I didn't.

875
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:23,062
那我的主张  是我的错
It was my decision, and it was wrong of me.

876
01:32:33,115 --> 01:32:35,049
你真是好心肠
You have such a good heart.

That's too bad, because I... Look what I found. I found this in the car.

882
01:32:53,268 --> 01:32:54,633
我以为...
I thought...

883
01:32:55,137 --> 01:32:57,571
或许你可以...
And I thought maybe you could...

884
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,567
或许你可以把它补回去
I thought maybe you could sew it back on.

890
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:17,322
停下  克莉丝  天呀
Stop! Chris! Oh, god!

891
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,894
天呢  不要不要不要
