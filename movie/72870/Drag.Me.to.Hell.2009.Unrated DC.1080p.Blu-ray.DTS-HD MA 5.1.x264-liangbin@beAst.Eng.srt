1
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,414
No! No!

2
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:29,425
No!

3
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,855
Juan!

4
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:44,186
Juan!

5
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:45,275
Repeat the following phrases precisely as spoken.

6
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,355
There is no friction with the proper diction.

7
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:52,386
There is no friction with the proper diction.

8
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:56,306
Good sounds abound when the mouth is round.

9
00:05:56,866 --> 00:06:00,536
Good sounds abound when the mouth is round.

10
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:04,376
Round. Round.

11
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:29,768
I think we can make this work. I'll call you this afternoon and let you know.

12
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:30,938
- Thank you so much.  - Thank you.

13
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:32,978
- You're welcome.  - Thank you.

14
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:34,658
- Thank you.  - Have a great day.

15
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,318
- Yeah, you, too. Have a good day.  - Okay.

16
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:38,058
- Thank you.  - Bye.

17
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:45,069
Assistant Manager

18
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:52,919
- Here you go, Mr Jacks.  - Thank you.

19
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,359
Mr Jacks?

20
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,619
I was wondering if you'd made any decision regarding the assistant manager's position.

21
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,230
Well, I'm still deciding, and right now, it's between Stu and yourself.

22
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,560
Stu Rubin, the new guy?

23
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,440
Well, I know he's new, but he's also quite aggressive, and we like that.

24
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,140
You know, Stu's someone who's not afraid to crunch the numbers

25
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,080
And make the tough decisions.

26
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,750
I'm perfectly capable of making the tough decisions.

27
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,170
I'll let you know as soon as I decide. Okay?

28
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,471
In the meantime, take him through our loan qualifying procedures,

29
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,011
Just in case, all right?

30
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:30,841
Okay.

31
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:35,181
And would you mind taking your lunch break now?

32
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,351
Sure.

33
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:39,621
And maybe on your way back, you could pick me up a turkey club?

34
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:42,412
Turkey club, excellent choice!

35
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,612
You mind picking one up for me? Thanks.

36
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:46,642
And spicy mustard.

37
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:49,532
- What have you got?  - Could I get your approval on this?

38
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:51,362
- This is the loan we talked about before.  - The loan.

39
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:52,662
Exactly.

40
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:54,862
- Good one, huh?  - One-point-five?

41
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:56,032
Absolutely, and it'll be one of many.

42
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,993
Well, Professor, congratulations on making it through your first week.

43
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:07,263
Thank you very much. Mmm.

44
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:12,103
- I thought you'd have a full beard by now.  - So did I. I'm a little disappointed.

45
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:15,613
Man, this thing. That's it. I'm done. I'm out.

46
00:08:16,624 --> 00:08:18,454
Chris, don't even bother.

47
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:20,764
I gotta get a new one.

48
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,364
I'm telling you, you're gonna drive yourself nuts. It's completely

49
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,304
Broken.

50
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:35,154
- Was broken.  - You are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.

51
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,905
I almost forgot. Found it at the bank.

52
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,235
What is this?

53
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:47,955
No way! Wow. It's a 1929 Standing Liberty, and it's almost fully struck.

54
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,825
You found this in regular circulation at the bank?

55
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:50,985
I did.

56
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:54,305
I'm gonna add this to my nerdy coin collection.

57
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:56,376
- Thank you, baby.  - Okay.

58
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:58,376
Thanks for thinking of me.

59
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:01,556
- All right. Bye.  - Bye.

60
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,786
- See you later.  - I'll see you later, okay?

61
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:07,726
- Dr Dalton.  - Hello, dear.

62
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:10,406
-Hi, Mom.  - What are you doing?

63
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,176
Christine just came over and brought some lunch,

64
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:14,806
- And I'm correcting some papers.  - Christine? The one from the farm?

65
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,577
Yeah, Mom, the girl I've been dating for almost a year,

66
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,827
The girl who's coming for dinner. We're still on for dinner?

67
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:22,337
- I'm sure she's a very sweet girl.  - She is. I can't wait for you...

68
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,927
But you know your father and I just have certain expectations for you

69
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:27,707
I can't really do the expectations...

70
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:29,447
- I understand Amy Kulick is looking for someone to play tennis with.  - Yeah, I...

71
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:32,077
You know, she graduated from Yale Law with honours,

72
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:34,528
And she's a very successful attorney now.

73
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:36,938
- I know. You told me.  - Yeah, that's the kind of girl

74
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:39,368
- I would love to see you with.  - Mother...

75
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:43,148
She's the kind of woman who could really help you socially

76
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,118
And, as a result, in your career.

77
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:47,418
And that's the kind of thing you should be thinking about now.

78
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:48,788
Mother, I don't wanna...

79
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,418
You can't be playing around with little girls off the farm.

80
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,939
I think you're really gonna... I think you're really gonna like...

81
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,269
It's time to really find a partner.

82
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:02,129
Christine, you messed up my order.

83
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:06,629
- No, I didn't.  - Yeah, I said no mayo.

84
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,380
You never said that.

85
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,450
You know what? Don't sweat it. It's okay.

86
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:33,361
Mr Jacks, by the way, aren't you a Laker fan?

87
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,491
I am a Laker fan.

88
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,041
My mom is having this thing on Sunday. I can't use these.

89
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,871
- Are you serious?  - Yeah. Absolutely. You want them?

90
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,281
- These are great seats!  - They are great seats.

91
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:41,941
This is where they bring the hot dogs right to you.

92
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,881
Yes, it is. You are gonna hobnob with celebs.

93
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:45,921
- You sure that's okay?  - Absolutely, it's okay. Yeah.

94
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,732
- Well, thank you, Stu.  - Take them. Absolutely.

95
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,392
Say hey to Kobe for me.

96
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:50,962
Of course.

97
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:56,582
Will you help me?

98
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,292
Of course. What can I do for you?

99
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,922
Your trucks are at my house.

100
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:03,922
The men are packing all my things, private things.

101
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:07,433
Please, make them stop.

102
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,963
- Mrs...  - Ganush.

103
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:20,133
Mrs Ganush, the bank is informing you of their intent

104
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:24,443
To repossess your property at 325 Brandon Street today.

105
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:27,614
But this is my home for 30 years.

106
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:32,834
And I make every payment until the sickness took my eye.

107
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:37,974
I hope to have more money soon. I just need a little more time. You...

108
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:41,414
I don't think my manager's going to extend you any more credit.

109
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:46,695
Please. Won't you try?

110
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:53,875
- Okay.  - Bless you.

111
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:57,275
Bless you!

112
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:06,966
We have an elderly woman asking for an extension on her mortgage payment.

113
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:10,576
She's on a fixed income, and she's had some medical problems.

114
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:13,646
There's gotta be something we can do to help her.

115
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:23,747
Well, apparently, we've already granted her two extensions.

116
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:27,827
And, you know, on this type of foreclosure, we seize the trapped equity

117
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,367
And the bank makes a sizable amount in fees.

118
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,657
We would have to throw her out of her house.

119
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:34,467
It's a tough decision.

120
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,147
Your call.

121
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,199
I'll take care of it.

122
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,390
Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

123
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,260
But another extension on the loan is out of the question.

124
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,830
- What?  - I would like to help, but it is in the bank's...

125
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,350
No, please, this is my home. Where will I live?

126
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,421
You list your granddaughter as a reference. Maybe you could stay with her.

127
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,121
I would not burden her.

128
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,291
And there are several fine assisted living facilities for the elderly...

129
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:52,211
A nursing home? No, I would never live in one of those places.

130
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:55,992
I'm really sorry.

131
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:23,553
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

132
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:26,893
And never have I begged for anything.

133
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:32,304
But now, I beg for you.

134
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:35,144
- I humble myself before you.  - Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.

135
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:37,914
- Please stand up.  - I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

136
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:40,984
On my mother's grave, I beg you!

137
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:45,264
Please let go. Let go! Security! Stop!

138
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:50,114
- Over here, Billy! Over here!  - We're coming.

139
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:01,035
You shame me.

140
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:14,326
I beg you, and you shame me.

141
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:17,836
I think your business is finished here, ma'am.

142
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,016
Let's go.

143
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,527
Mrs Ganush...

144
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:36,447
Get out of here!

145
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,717
- Come on, ma'am.  - Let's go.

146
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,878
I never saw anything quite like that before.

147
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:52,048
Are you okay?

148
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:56,488
You handled that just right, you know.

149
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:10,089
- Good night. See you tomorrow.  - Okay.

150
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,439
You know, I just finished going over this McPherson loan.

151
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:19,949
- This is very impressive work.  - Thanks.

152
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:22,489
Would you mind taking this home tonight and finishing it up?

153
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,830
Because I would like to show it to the regional veep in the morning.

154
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,700
- I would love to.  - Great.

155
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,170
Thank you.

156
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,740
And as far as that assistant manager's position goes,

157
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,820
You're at the top of the list.

158
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:32,686
You shamed me.

159
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:39,473
I beat you, you old bitch!

160
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:10,375
No!

161
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:41,367
Lamia.

162
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:59,918
Soon it will be you who comes begging to me.

163
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:34,329
- She's right over there.  - Thank you, thank you.

164
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,980
Once they send some officers over to have a talk with her,

165
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,350
she's not gonna be bothering you any more, okay?

166
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,920
So don't even think about her.

167
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,550
And I'm gonna call Mr Jacks and just make sure

168
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,830
He can have somebody walk you to your car every night, okay?

169
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,170
Okay.

170
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:55,511
I just thank God you're okay. You are okay, right?

171
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:57,621
I'm fine.

172
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,291
What? What's the matter?

173
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:07,101
It's just that maybe I could have gotten her another extension on her loan.

174
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,581
Chris, no, don't do that.

175
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:11,811
You said the bank granted this woman two extensions already, right?

176
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:13,992
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage, you lose your house.

177
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,762
What does this woman expect? It's not your fault.

178
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:19,392
You can't beat yourself up over it.

179
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:29,122
I mean, what'd she expect? It's not your fault.

180
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:32,363
And regardless of what you may or may not have been able to do,

181
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:35,263
That's still no justification for her...

182
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,793
What is it? What's wrong?

183
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:49,303
- Did you hear that?  - What?

184
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:51,234
Really? You didn't?

185
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:54,414
No. What?

186
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:01,924
I know this is gonna sound weird, but I wanna get my fortune read.

187
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:06,944
Now? Are you kidding?

188
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,455
Come on, Chris. I'll read your fortune for you.

189
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:13,955
In the near future, we are gonna get in the car,

190
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:16,965
- Go home and relax.  - Clay, I really want to do this.

191
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:19,805
Why? Because of what happened with that old woman?

192
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:23,215
Chris, I really think we should just get you home now.

193
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:26,576
Can you do this for me?

194
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,346
I pray to God none of my students see me here.

195
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:42,086
The only class I'll be able to teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.

196
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,927
Yeah, there's so many things to choose from here.

197
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:49,097
Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,

198
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:50,597
Which is a weird little dried monkey head.

199
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:52,877
Wait, no, never mind, he's got one.

200
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:57,887
I am Rham Jas, seer.

201
00:24:58,727 --> 00:25:03,577
- I'm Christine and this is Clay. -But you probably already knew that, right?

202
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:08,188
- Just kidding. -How can I help you?

203
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,858
I would like to have my fortune read. Can you do that?

204
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,988
I have the ability to see certain energies.

205
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:18,708
Sometimes these energies are a foretoken of things to come.

206
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,038
$60, please.

207
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,878
- Seriously?  - Yes.

208
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:25,619
Sixty... Doesn't that seem a little steep for this sort of thing?

209
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:30,529
- If you're not serious, please go. -All right. Come on, Chris.

210
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:33,209
Wait, wait! I'll... I'll pay.

211
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:36,479
No, you know what? You know what? I got it. I got it.

212
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:41,329
- There you go.  - Platinum card. Very good.

213
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,680
Thank you.

214
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,650
-Here, here, baby. -Thanks.

215
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,950
Sure.

216
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,130
Uh-uh. Please.

217
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,031
Okay.

218
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:02,641
So, you wish to know something of your destiny.

219
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:03,871
- Yes.  - Very good.

220
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,481
Let's see what the fates have in store.

221
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:07,821
You know, Freud said destiny was not an act of fate,

222
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:09,651
But rather something created by our subconscious

223
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:11,521
To control our conscious choices.

224
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:16,661
That's true. But we cannot attempt to understand the world by intellect alone.

225
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,072
- Carl Jung.  - Yes.

226
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:22,822
From his treatise Psychological Types.

227
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:26,332
- So...  - Jung, the New Agers' favourite psychologist.

228
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,692
Because he wasn't afraid to bring God into the equation.

229
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:30,072
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God into...

230
00:26:30,182 --> 00:26:33,582
- Clay, Clay, come on.  - Let's do it. I know. Come on. Let's start.

231
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:35,442
- Shall we?  - I'm ready.

232
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,213
Very well. Please, give me your hand.

233
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:38,953
Okay.

234
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,193
This way. Okay.

235
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,473
You work with money.

236
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:51,873
That's right.

237
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:55,593
And you've recently lost something.

238
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:03,244
- No, I don't think so.  - No. No, you haven't lost anything.

239
00:27:04,354 --> 00:27:06,684
But something's been taken from you.

240
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:08,754
No.

241
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:12,304
- A button.  - Oh, my God. Yes!

242
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:15,035
Well, anyone can see she's missing a button! So what?

243
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:16,375
But, Clay, it was really strange.

244
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:18,875
The old woman today, she took a button from my sleeve.

245
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:22,825
- Why would she do that?  - If you would both please just be quiet!

246
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,719
- I think that's enough for tonight.  - What's wrong?

247
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:42,369
I'm tired, and I see it's become quite late.

248
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:44,369
I will, of course, refund your money.

249
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,999
Wait, wait, wait! Did you see something?

250
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,220
A dark spirit has come upon you.

251
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,760
- What do you mean?  - Well, he's...

252
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,730
Did you blaspheme the dead while visiting a graveyard?

253
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,890
- No!  - Did you play with a Ouija board

254
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,840
Or consort with those who practise the black arts?

255
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,240
All right, take it easy, man. Come on.

256
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,370
Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay. No. No, I didn't.

257
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,280
Perhaps someone has cursed you.

258
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,451
Then how did he know all that?

259
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,481
Know what? That you lost a button?

260
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:16,811
And by the way, he didn't really know that much.

261
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,821
He makes a couple of good guesses, then he...

262
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:21,831
He stirs you up, and then he leaves you with all these questions

263
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:24,491
And, conveniently, his business card.

264
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:27,662
Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.

265
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:31,182
But he didn't want the money. He tried to give it back, remember?

266
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:35,022
Well, he sort of tried, but in the end, he took it, didn't he?

267
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,532
I guess so.

268
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:04,824
I gotta go meet the guy that's towing your car,

269
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:05,924
So you gonna be okay?

270
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:08,324
- Yeah.  - All right. Kitty, take care of her.

271
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:10,094
- I'll see you in about an hour. Love you.  - Okay.

272
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:11,444
Okay.

273
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:01,626
- Here. Put that on your lip.  - Thank you.

274
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:03,207
I can't believe she came to the house.

275
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,207
This is so nuts. I'm calling the cops.

276
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:08,447
- It wasn't her.  - Who was it then?

277
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:10,047
I don't know. I couldn't see who it was.

278
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,747
Of course it was her. It had to be her.

279
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:13,757
No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!

280
00:34:13,827 --> 00:34:15,987
It was somebody. Chris, it had to be somebody.

281
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,567
The lights were out. You just couldn't see who it was,

282
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:20,837
- But I'm guessing it was...  - Clay, there wasn't anybody here.

283
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:23,408
Then who did this?

284
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:26,588
Who hit you in the face?

285
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,948
I think it's just a reaction to her being attacked earlier in the day.

286
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:39,538
Yeah. Classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

287
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,059
Yeah, she's showing signs of panic and paranoia. so...

288
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,629
No, no, no, I'll be fine.

289
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:47,059
All right.

290
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,899
Hey, hey.

291
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:54,709
How you doing?

292
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:55,979
-Better. -Yeah?

293
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:58,159
Especially after the doctor explained it to me.

294
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,200
He said that victims of violence,

295
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,740
- They re-experience...  - Re-experience their trauma.

296
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,510
I misinterpreted it to be something more than it was.

297
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,940
- Happens.  - I just... I feel...

298
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,030
- What?  - Kind of embarrassed.

299
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,350
Are you kidding?

300
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,870
No. You never have to be embarrassed with me.

301
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:21,471
Okay?

302
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,791
Hey, listen, I was thinking maybe we could take a little trip on Saturday,

303
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:33,671
- Get on the train and go to Santa barbara.  - Your folks' cabin.

304
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:35,171
Yeah, if you're up for it, the cabin.

305
00:35:35,312 --> 00:35:37,572
- Oh, my god, I would love to!  - Yeah? Good.

306
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:39,992
- That'd be so exciting.  - Baby, you're gonna love it.

307
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:41,112
- You're gonna love it.  - Okay, good.

308
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:42,252
I'm excited for you to see it.

309
00:35:42,362 --> 00:35:43,922
- These trees and it's private.  - That would be great.

310
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:45,522
It'll be great. It'll be good.

311
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:51,042
I think we need to. and we can just... We can just talk and stuff.

312
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,339
What?

313
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:05,689
- What's the matter?  - I couldn't... I couldn't wake up.

314
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,030
It's okay. Okay. Come here. It was just a dream.

315
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:26,461
Baby, that's the rental car they dropped off this morning.

316
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,191
- Okay? Sure. -Thanks.

317
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:31,141
- Love you.  - Love you, too.

318
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:37,081
Hey, baby, try not to piss off any old ladies today, okay?

319
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:57,462
Hey, Christine?

320
00:38:57,972 --> 00:39:00,412
- What, are you just getting here?  - What are you, the hall monitor?

321
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:02,813
Ha, ha. Very funny, Christine.

322
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:05,283
What's this?

323
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:07,583
What do you want?

324
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:10,923
I need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures.

325
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:15,773
I've got a lot on my mind. Can we do this tomorrow?

326
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:17,103
- Sure.  - Okay.

327
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:19,453
I'll just tell Mr Jacks that you don't have the time right now.

328
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,864
- Maybe he can tell me.  - No, no! Okay, I'll do it.

329
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:24,624
Okay.

330
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,144
We were going over the asset-based lending guidelines.

331
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:29,514
Right.

332
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:31,584
Let's say your client is a company

333
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,204
That can't get traditional bank financing.

334
00:39:45,515 --> 00:39:47,745
- And?  - And...

335
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,265
And?

336
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,766
And...

337
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:03,276
And get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk!

338
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:13,936
Christine blood... Brown.

339
00:40:14,807 --> 00:40:17,087
Christine. Your nose.

340
00:40:18,597 --> 00:40:20,147
Sure, can you hold?

341
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:22,627
- Let me help you.  - No, no, I've got it under control.

342
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:24,997
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

343
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:28,677
God! Oh, my god! Stop it!

344
00:40:29,617 --> 00:40:30,837
Mr Jacks!

345
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:32,687
- Did I get any in my mouth?  - Oh, my god!

346
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:33,688
Did I get any in my mouth?

347
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:36,028
Let me take you over here to get clean.

348
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:39,468
I'm so sorry! Oh, my god!

349
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,208
It's just a nosebleed.

350
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:45,548
- Did I get any in my mouth?  - We'll clean you up. We have antiseptic.

351
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:39,941
What is it?

352
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:47,021
Hi. I came to see Sylvia ganush. Is she here?

353
00:41:47,662 --> 00:41:49,152
Who are you?

354
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:52,622
I'm a friend of hers.

355
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,042
- Someone...  - Wait.

356
00:41:58,052 --> 00:42:01,882
I know who you are. Grandma told me you would come.

357
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:05,502
You are the woman from the bank, the one who took her house.

358
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:07,333
Actually, it was the bank that took the house.

359
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:09,563
I mean, I just work there.

360
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:13,413
In fact, I tried to help your grandma get the house back,

361
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:15,073
But my boss wouldn't let me.

362
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:18,923
Are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face?

363
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:28,954
- No.  - You used to be a real fat girl, didn't you?

364
00:42:35,644 --> 00:42:37,764
- Yeah.  - I can tell.

365
00:42:38,814 --> 00:42:40,744
You are not welcome here.

366
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:44,494
Wait! wait. I need to see her.

367
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,655
I need her to forgive me. And I'll get her the house back.

368
00:42:47,795 --> 00:42:50,765
And you are gonna make everything all right for her, is that it?

369
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,005
Yes.

370
00:42:53,475 --> 00:42:54,845
Come on.

371
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,646
Where is she?

372
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:07,509
- Get her off me! Get her off me!  - Come! Don't look.

373
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:12,609
- Grab her shoulder.  - Be a man! Lift her up!

374
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,540
- Be careful.  - Let's roll the dice!

375
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,550
Still going to make everything all right for her?

376
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,020
You deserve everything that is coming to you.

377
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,581
- One more time!

378
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:42,181
I believe what plagues you is the lamia.

379
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:44,521
Lamia, that's the word the old woman used.

380
00:44:44,591 --> 00:44:48,591
The black goat, only summoned by gypsies for their darkest deeds.

381
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:50,911
For the first three days,

382
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:54,871
The lamia appears as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.

383
00:44:54,952 --> 00:44:57,892
After that, it reveals itself to be a taker of souls,

384
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:00,392
And it comes for the owner of the accursed object.

385
00:45:00,462 --> 00:45:01,952
Accursed object. What object?

386
00:45:02,062 --> 00:45:05,472
Something taken from the victim, cursed and given back.

387
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:10,782
This?

388
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:14,153
What if I just burn it?

389
00:45:14,293 --> 00:45:17,323
I'm afraid no matter what condition the button is in,

390
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:21,333
You would still be the owner. The lamia would still come to take you.

391
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:23,143
Take me where?

392
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:34,133
- Then how do I get rid of this?  - You could attempt to appease the spirit.

393
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:36,144
The simplest way would be a blood offering.

394
00:45:36,214 --> 00:45:40,154
A small creature could be sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.

395
00:45:40,224 --> 00:45:42,314
No way! Look, I'm a vegetarian.

396
00:45:42,394 --> 00:45:45,334
I volunteer at the puppy shelter, for christ's sake.

397
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:47,494
I don't go around killing animals.

398
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:49,504
You will be surprised what you'll be willing to do

399
00:45:49,575 --> 00:45:51,735
When the lamia comes for you.

400
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,075
This will show you how.

401
00:50:00,718 --> 00:50:02,408
Here, kitty, kitty.

402
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:25,829
Chris! Chris?

403
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:28,769
Chris?

404
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:33,390
Hey, there you are. What are you doing out here?

405
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,150
Baby, I called the bank. They said you left early.

406
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,730
You're not answering my calls. Is that blood?

407
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,140
No. why would there be blood?

408
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,190
Yeah, baby, there's... there's blood on your sleeve.

409
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:49,311
- Are you bleeding?  - No.

410
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:51,191
It was just tomato juice.

411
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:53,091
I was cutting a tomato in the

412
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,001
Kitchen and it must have gotten on my sleeve.

413
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:02,411
Hey, chris, why don't we do this dinner another time?

414
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:05,951
You've had a rough couple of days. I think it's better.

415
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,122
No, I want to go to the dinner.

416
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:11,572
I know, but are you sure you're feeling all right?

417
00:51:13,382 --> 00:51:15,712
Honestly, I haven't been.

418
00:51:21,962 --> 00:51:23,562
But I think...

419
00:51:23,903 --> 00:51:26,803
I think that everything is gonna be okay now.

420
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:30,273
I really do.

421
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:36,823
What do you think?

422
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,203
You look beautiful.

423
00:51:45,784 --> 00:51:48,954
It really is. My god.

424
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:51,284
It's gonna be nice inside, too.

425
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:55,874
They're gonna love you.

426
00:51:58,644 --> 00:52:00,234
- Clayton.  - Hello, mother.

427
00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:01,584
Good to see you. This is Christine.

428
00:52:01,695 --> 00:52:03,685
- That's my mom, Trudy.  - Hello, Christine.

429
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:05,855
Hello. It's very nice to meet you.

430
00:52:06,195 --> 00:52:08,675
- Well.  - Please, come in. Come in.

431
00:52:08,745 --> 00:52:09,835
Yes.

432
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:11,535
- Hey, Dad, how are you?  - Hey, son.

433
00:52:11,615 --> 00:52:13,345
Good to see you, sir.

434
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:15,175
This is Christine. Christine, this is my dad, Leonard.

435
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:16,345
- Nice to meet you.  - Hi, Maria. Thank you.

436
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:20,025
- You have a beautiful home.  - Well, thank you very much.

437
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:22,356
- Can I get you a drink?  - Yeah, wine?

438
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:23,796
- Do you guys want?  - Sure.

439
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:27,716
- Okay. Come help me.  - I'll be right back.

440
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:30,606
Yes, dear.

441
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:34,256
- I hope you don't mind.  - How thoughtful.

442
00:52:34,336 --> 00:52:35,996
- Homemade?  - Yes.

443
00:52:36,096 --> 00:52:38,896
And what type of cake would you call that?

444
00:52:39,437 --> 00:52:40,967
It's called

445
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:43,417
A harvest cake.

446
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:46,577
Is that something you would make on a farm?

447
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,687
No.

448
00:52:50,937 --> 00:52:56,607
I mean, not any more. We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.

449
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:59,348
- Geese?  - Well, right around the harvest time,

450
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:02,548
That's when your goose eggs will make a real dense yolk.

451
00:53:03,128 --> 00:53:05,118
It makes for a rich cake.

452
00:53:07,408 --> 00:53:09,378
Well, just thank you.

453
00:53:10,378 --> 00:53:12,708
- Here we are.  - Sorry to interrupt the bonding sesh.

454
00:53:12,808 --> 00:53:14,008
- Why don't you join us in the dining room?  - Good.

455
00:53:14,088 --> 00:53:16,818
- Yeah, let's go. It's right in here.  - Okay.

456
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:19,919
- Jeez.  - Hecuba.

457
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:23,599
I never did understand that damned animal. I hate cats.

458
00:53:23,709 --> 00:53:27,339
That is so strange. Hecuba is usually very sweet.

459
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:30,249
That's okay. I had a cat. I understand.

460
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:33,419
You mean... you mean you have a cat.

461
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,030
What do you mean? Did something happen?

462
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,130
Unless something happened to him.

463
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,980
Well, how am I supposed to know?

464
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,550
I mean, you know how cats are. They come and they go.

465
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,230
That's true.

466
00:53:53,571 --> 00:53:56,521
- Well, should...  - Well... yes. Yes, please.

467
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,521
So, how's the coin collection, son?

468
00:53:59,621 --> 00:54:02,491
That's my dad's way of saying, "so, you're still a huge nerd?"

469
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:04,931
It's good. It's good. In fact, Christine just got me

470
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:06,971
A 1929 standing liberty quarter at her bank.

471
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:09,101
- Really?  - Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.

472
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:12,481
I just think the job of a bank teller must be so difficult,

473
00:54:12,552 --> 00:54:16,222
With all that counting and repetition. It must get very tedious.

474
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:17,522
Yes, you're right,

475
00:54:18,032 --> 00:54:19,802
- But I'm not a teller.  - Oh?

476
00:54:19,872 --> 00:54:21,672
Yeah, mom, I told you. Christine's a loan officer.

477
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:25,072
She handles all the loans for small businesses and homes for her bank.

478
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:28,712
And she's up for this big promotion, so... right, Chris?

479
00:54:28,822 --> 00:54:31,032
If I could close this one account that I'm working on,

480
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:31,993
It would really help.

481
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:34,153
That must be a very important loan.

482
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:37,073
It's the biggest that my branch has ever handled.

483
00:54:37,183 --> 00:54:39,343
And how did that come to you?

484
00:54:39,683 --> 00:54:41,843
Well, I was reading the wall street journal

485
00:54:41,913 --> 00:54:44,213
And came across this medical supply company

486
00:54:44,293 --> 00:54:47,733
That was looking to expand but didn't have the liquidity.

487
00:54:47,803 --> 00:54:50,703
So I met with their CEO and presented a formula

488
00:54:50,774 --> 00:54:53,544
For restructuring some of their long-term debt.

489
00:54:53,614 --> 00:54:56,214
Sounds like you've got a lot going for you, Christine.

490
00:54:56,284 --> 00:54:59,154
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.

491
00:54:59,384 --> 00:55:00,794
I suppose.

492
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:08,754
I don't see much of my mother.

493
00:55:08,815 --> 00:55:12,015
- Why is that?  - Wow, mom, that's... it's kind of personal.

494
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:14,185
I'm speaking to Christine.

495
00:55:18,005 --> 00:55:22,805
Well, ever since my dad died, she doesn't talk much.

496
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:29,655
She just stays on the farm and keeps to herself because...

497
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:32,466
Because?

498
00:55:32,526 --> 00:55:36,306
Because her husband died, mom, and she just wants to be by herself.

499
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:39,476
- Why don't...  - Because my mother's an alcoholic.

500
00:55:41,196 --> 00:55:42,216
Oh.

501
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:45,216
I'm sorry.

502
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:48,997
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

503
00:55:49,677 --> 00:55:52,947
I have to say, I find your honesty very refreshing.

504
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:55,267
My father had a drinking problem,

505
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:57,177
And I was always too ashamed to admit it.

506
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:00,297
You've got backbone.

507
00:56:00,967 --> 00:56:02,697
Unlike that last girl he brought by.

508
00:56:02,768 --> 00:56:04,358
- What was her name?  - Alice.

509
00:56:04,438 --> 00:56:05,958
- We don't have to...  - Alicia!

510
00:56:06,078 --> 00:56:08,208
- Alicia.  - She was dreadful, Christine.

511
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:11,378
She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.

512
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:12,578
That's not really...  - They met on the internet.

513
00:56:12,658 --> 00:56:13,748
What is that,

514
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:14,888
Really?

515
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:17,228
- What does that mean?  - Am I being too hard on him?

516
00:56:17,308 --> 00:56:18,328
No, not at all.

517
00:56:18,438 --> 00:56:19,768
Thanks a lot...

518
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,498
You know, I think I will try some of that cake of yours.

519
00:56:21,609 --> 00:56:22,949
Look at that. It looks great.

520
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:26,989
It looks so interesting.

521
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:30,469
You only dislike it if you hate delicious things.

522
00:56:32,109 --> 00:56:34,099
Not my problem.

523
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:36,499
Lovely.

524
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:38,099
Thank you, Christine. This is wonderful.

525
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:40,019
It also changed the subject nicely.

526
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,850
Thank you. That looks good!

527
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,320
That's right.

528
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,800
It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?

529
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,710
Did you hear something?

530
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,800
No. You okay?

531
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,640
Tasty!

532
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,390
- I like it a lot.  - I do like it.

533
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,740
You know, mom, when you say we met on the internet,

534
00:56:58,741 --> 00:57:00,191
It's a little misleading.

535
00:57:18,642 --> 00:57:21,382
Yes, well you need to do that to find a good mate.

536
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:22,972
You can't even trust

537
00:57:23,082 --> 00:57:25,212
The things you hear or that people write about themselves.

538
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:27,312
- Very nice.  - Even the pictures are false half the time.

539
00:57:27,422 --> 00:57:28,632
It's true.

540
00:57:28,732 --> 00:57:30,762
I don't think it's a misconception

541
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:32,462
To think that people of good breeding

542
00:57:32,572 --> 00:57:34,272
And success should be able to meet

543
00:57:34,272 --> 00:57:36,782
Potential life partners in a realistic situation.

544
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,443
Well, you also have a thing about bars.

545
00:57:48,113 --> 00:57:49,873
Would you, Christine?

546
00:57:52,223 --> 00:57:57,023
- No, no, of course not.  - What? What... but we did.

547
00:57:57,124 --> 00:57:58,994
We met at a bar, Chris. What are you talking about?

548
00:57:59,064 --> 00:58:00,874
She...

549
00:58:00,974 --> 00:58:05,374
It's not a klan rally, mom. It's a bar.

550
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:09,124
Yeah, we met... we met at a bar,

551
00:58:09,124 --> 00:58:11,534
And we set up the date on the internet.

552
00:58:12,494 --> 00:58:15,524
You okay? You okay?

553
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:20,375
Some water? Baby, have some... went down the wrong pipe.

554
00:58:21,355 --> 00:58:22,685
Oh, my god!

555
00:58:34,586 --> 00:58:37,056
I'm sorry, I don't... there must be a window open.

556
00:58:38,256 --> 00:58:39,416
Chris?

557
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:45,636
Okay, I hear you!

558
00:58:45,736 --> 00:58:47,226
What in the hell?  - Leave me alone.

559
00:58:47,336 --> 00:58:49,736
- Just leave me the hell alone!  - Hey! Hey! Chris! Stop it!

560
00:58:49,856 --> 00:58:51,946
Baby! There's no one there.

561
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:55,687
Okay.

562
00:58:58,037 --> 00:59:01,377
- I think I'd better go.  - Yes, I think that would be best.

563
00:59:01,977 --> 00:59:03,717
I know. Wait, Chris...

564
00:59:03,717 --> 00:59:06,047
Don't follow her! She's a sick girl.

565
00:59:06,057 --> 00:59:08,487
- Mom, she needs my help.  - Let her go.

566
00:59:10,728 --> 00:59:11,788
Wait!

567
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:14,908
What's the matter?

568
00:59:15,408 --> 00:59:19,408
Look, I did what you said! I killed that little kitty!

569
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,678
You're so full of shit!

570
00:59:21,748 --> 00:59:24,558
These are elusive and powerful forces we are dealing with.

571
00:59:24,668 --> 00:59:26,598
There are no guarantees.

572
00:59:44,139 --> 00:59:47,039
We must speak directly to this dark spirit.

573
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:51,320
We must dissuade it from taking your soul, and soon.

574
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:56,400
- I know someone who can help us.  - And I'm supposed to trust you?

575
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,560
Tomorrow is the third day. After that, the lamia will come for you.

576
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:03,850
We can't let that happen. But you must understand,

577
01:00:04,921 --> 01:00:08,521
The woman who can help us must put herself at great risk.

578
01:00:08,861 --> 01:00:12,361
- She will not do that for free.  - What do you need from me?

579
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:14,941
$10,000 cash

580
01:00:16,441 --> 01:00:17,711
By tomorrow.

581
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,972
- Mr Jacks.  - Yeah?

582
01:00:33,582 --> 01:00:37,922
This is kind of awkward for me, and I know it's not official yet,

583
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:42,692
But I was wondering if I could get an advance for the new position.

584
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:45,013
What, the assistant manager's position?

585
01:00:45,113 --> 01:00:48,343
Yes. See, one of my family members is really sick.

586
01:00:49,783 --> 01:00:52,853
- They're not gonna die, but they could.  - Christine. Christine.

587
01:00:52,963 --> 01:00:57,593
There's a problem. The Mcpherson deal was cancelled last night.

588
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:59,133
- What?  - Yeah.

589
01:00:59,803 --> 01:01:01,513
Right after I informed the regional

590
01:01:01,514 --> 01:01:03,544
Office that we had this big loan pending,

591
01:01:03,654 --> 01:01:07,144
I find out that they just made their deal over at first national.

592
01:01:07,254 --> 01:01:09,134
Now, I gotta call in to see what exactly happened,

593
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:13,174
But right now, this does not look too good for you or for me.

594
01:01:14,744 --> 01:01:19,014
So, this assistant manager promotion has been delayed.

595
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,095
In fact, you know, I think, with everything that's been happening,

596
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:26,365
I think I'm gonna have to give this job to Stu.

597
01:01:27,275 --> 01:01:29,035
Stu. I see.

598
01:01:30,115 --> 01:01:32,775
I'm sorry. Look, if you've got family problems,

599
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:36,385
Maybe you should take the day off, sort them out and...

600
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:47,719
- So, how much?  - $3,800 for everything.

601
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:50,689
- Including my jewellery?  - Including.

602
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,659
But this Stuff is worth so much more than that.

603
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:57,980
Please. This is all I have. I'm begging you.

604
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,150
Take it or leave it.

605
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,610
Chris? Chris?

606
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:16,281
Baby?

607
01:03:35,492 --> 01:03:38,162
I thought you were lactose intolerant.

608
01:03:39,512 --> 01:03:40,672
I am.

609
01:03:41,842 --> 01:03:45,082
But then I thought, "screw it, I'm eating ice cream."

610
01:03:48,363 --> 01:03:50,023
I paid Rham Jas.

611
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:56,533
What? You're kidding me.

612
01:03:57,383 --> 01:03:58,943
I paid him.

613
01:04:00,013 --> 01:04:03,053
Why? I mean, I thought that you didn't believe.

614
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:06,523
I don't know what I believe in any more.

615
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:10,414
I really don't, but I know that you believe in this.

616
01:04:11,554 --> 01:04:13,174
I know how important it is to you,

617
01:04:13,254 --> 01:04:16,654
And I know how much pain this is causing you.

618
01:04:18,234 --> 01:04:21,824
And, I also remembered...

619
01:04:22,604 --> 01:04:25,344
I remembered a promise that I made

620
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:28,785
The night I fell in love with you.

621
01:04:28,925 --> 01:04:31,115
I told myself that I would...

622
01:04:31,855 --> 01:04:35,805
I would always look out for you. I'd always take care of you.

623
01:04:37,635 --> 01:04:39,125
So I paid him.

624
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:45,155
You remember the night that you fell in love with me?

625
01:04:45,296 --> 01:04:48,286
I remember the second I fell in love with you.

626
01:04:50,006 --> 01:04:51,406
Oh, my god.

627
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:06,767
You sure you don't want me to go in with you?

628
01:05:06,877 --> 01:05:08,307
He said I should come alone.

629
01:05:08,377 --> 01:05:11,707
Yeah, I know, I know he did. He told me the same thing.

630
01:05:48,099 --> 01:05:49,799
Christine, if you will permit me

631
01:05:49,939 --> 01:05:53,099
The pleasure of an introduction, Shaun San Dena.

632
01:05:56,489 --> 01:05:59,049
- Welcome.  - How do you do?

633
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,220
Shaun San Denais an experienced medium.

634
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:05,430
Furthermore, she's personally been touched by the Lamia.

635
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:10,000
I first encountered this spirit many years ago in this very house.

636
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,020
And what happened?

637
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:19,930
I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.

638
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:29,161
I have waited these long years

639
01:06:30,231 --> 01:06:33,721
For a chance at redeeming myself,

640
01:06:34,231 --> 01:06:37,371
A chance to destroy the foul thing.

641
01:06:45,432 --> 01:06:48,072
Tonight, my chance will come.

642
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:53,282
But to summon it, I will need your help.

643
01:06:54,753 --> 01:06:56,413
Can you be strong?

644
01:06:59,123 --> 01:07:00,453
I'll try.

645
01:07:05,643 --> 01:07:08,803
My late husband, Sandor, was also medium.

646
01:07:09,423 --> 01:07:11,323
He chose this site to build a house upon

647
01:07:11,453 --> 01:07:15,323
Because he sensed certain forces at work here.

648
01:07:16,494 --> 01:07:19,994
In this place, there is a particular...

649
01:07:28,864 --> 01:07:30,354
A particular confluence of forces

650
01:07:30,494 --> 01:07:33,624
Which allows a doorway to be opened through which we may pass...

651
01:07:38,715 --> 01:07:41,985
...and through which others may pass into our world.

652
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:49,395
Please be seated.

653
01:08:17,777 --> 01:08:18,797
What's going on?

654
01:08:18,907 --> 01:08:21,547
Everything we're doing is for your own good.

655
01:08:21,547 --> 01:08:25,657
Please. Christine, please.

656
01:08:30,268 --> 01:08:31,608
Thank you.

657
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:05,569
Once the spirit has entered me, put my hand upon the animal.

658
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,750
- Do you understand?  - Yes.

659
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:12,920
I force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat.

660
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,430
Milos, that's when you strike.

661
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:19,930
I understand.

662
01:09:30,911 --> 01:09:32,901
We all must be receptive.

663
01:09:47,842 --> 01:09:51,682
- What am I supposed to do?  - You must allow the darkness in.

664
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:55,452
You must invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit.

665
01:09:56,332 --> 01:09:58,492
- I'm scared.  - Yes.

666
01:09:59,502 --> 01:10:03,372
Now repeat these words, "I welcome the dead into my soul."

667
01:10:07,883 --> 01:10:11,353
- I welcome the dead into my soul.  - You must believe it!

668
01:10:12,133 --> 01:10:14,503
I welcome the dead into my soul.

669
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:19,143
- I welcome the dead into my soul.  - I welcome the dead into my soul.

670
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:22,684
- I welcome the dead into my soul.  - ...into my soul.

671
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:29,334
I welcome the dead into my soul. I welcome the dead into my soul.

672
01:10:29,504 --> 01:10:38,894
I welcome the dead into my soul.

673
01:10:38,955 --> 01:10:40,185
I welcome the dead...

674
01:10:42,775 --> 01:10:48,605
I welcome the dead into my soul.

675
01:10:48,715 --> 01:10:50,235
I welcome the dead into...

676
01:10:53,825 --> 01:10:56,125
Something else is here with us.

677
01:10:57,766 --> 01:10:58,836
Yes.

678
01:11:27,537 --> 01:11:29,467
This is not the Lamia.

679
01:11:29,537 --> 01:11:32,817
It is the spirit of some

680
01:11:33,488 --> 01:11:36,858
Unsettled soul from years ago.

681
01:11:37,828 --> 01:11:40,898
Sometimes the unsettled ones linger by the door.

682
01:11:42,008 --> 01:11:44,668
There are others here, as well.

683
01:11:54,929 --> 01:11:57,879
Begone, foolish spirits! Begone!

684
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:13,010
She is coming.

685
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:59,255
Who now inhabits the body of Shaun San Dena?

686
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:06,486
Lamia!

687
01:14:12,606 --> 01:14:14,666
Lamia, what is it you desire?

688
01:14:14,756 --> 01:14:19,086
I desire the soul of Christine Brown!

689
01:14:19,356 --> 01:14:23,066
We will feast upon it as she festers in the grave!

690
01:14:23,147 --> 01:14:25,707
No! It was my manager, Jim Jacks!

691
01:14:25,777 --> 01:14:27,647
- He was the one! He was...  - Silence!

692
01:14:27,747 --> 01:14:31,987
Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded from taking this insignificant woman.

693
01:14:32,097 --> 01:14:34,997
Surely she is not worthy of your greatness.

694
01:14:43,848 --> 01:14:45,248
No!

695
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:52,668
I come for you, Christine.

696
01:14:54,868 --> 01:14:56,438
You're mine!

697
01:15:01,659 --> 01:15:02,889
No!

698
01:15:03,059 --> 01:15:06,869
You tricked me! You black-hearted whore!

699
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,529
- Now, Milos, now!  - You bitch.

700
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,840
Away, unclean spirit.

701
01:15:40,951 --> 01:15:42,281
Lamia!

702
01:15:42,381 --> 01:15:44,681
As one who summoned you to this circle,

703
01:15:44,691 --> 01:15:46,991
I command you to leave this instant.

704
01:15:53,451 --> 01:15:54,941
Christine!

705
01:16:01,602 --> 01:16:06,122
I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!

706
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,193
Shaun san dena!

707
01:16:20,173 --> 01:16:22,143
You must banish the spirit!

708
01:16:22,303 --> 01:16:23,333
Yes!

709
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:57,045
Milos!

710
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:01,725
- Oh, my god. I'm okay.  - Thank god!

711
01:17:01,795 --> 01:17:03,735
- I'm okay.  - Unbelievable!

712
01:17:06,345 --> 01:17:08,335
- You did it!  - Thank god.

713
01:17:10,486 --> 01:17:11,846
I tried.

714
01:17:11,956 --> 01:17:12,976
Are you okay?

715
01:17:13,756 --> 01:17:15,596
Oh, my god. Help me!

716
01:17:20,506 --> 01:17:22,266
Call an ambulance.

717
01:17:26,156 --> 01:17:27,776
Is she breathing?

718
01:17:29,357 --> 01:17:30,887
No.

719
01:17:34,007 --> 01:17:35,307
Oh, my gosh.

720
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:19,329
- It's so sad.  - Yes.

721
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:22,249
Strange how things work out.

722
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:26,279
She waited 40 years for another chance to overcome the Lamia,

723
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:32,660
And finally, on the last night of her life, she did.

724
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,100
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

725
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:40,220
The Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.

726
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:43,620
This is our lesson tonight. I'm sorry.

727
01:18:43,691 --> 01:18:45,641
- But I saw her get rid of the thing.  - No.

728
01:18:45,701 --> 01:18:49,001
You saw her drive it. That is all.

729
01:18:49,711 --> 01:18:52,731
It will be back. The goat was never slaughtered.

730
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:55,681
When this night is through,

731
01:18:56,491 --> 01:19:00,151
The Lamia will come for the owner of the accursed object.

732
01:19:03,842 --> 01:19:08,612
Unless, of course, you are no longer the owner. Do you have the button?

733
01:19:16,462 --> 01:19:20,212
Make a gift of it and you've given the curse away.

734
01:19:23,883 --> 01:19:25,593
Why didn't you tell me this before?

735
01:19:25,663 --> 01:19:29,223
Because the Lamia will tear the soul out of whoever you give that to.

736
01:19:29,303 --> 01:19:31,823
They'll burn in hell for eternity.

737
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:36,673
And I would have sent them there.

738
01:19:37,284 --> 01:19:39,584
And I would be your accomplice.

739
01:19:41,154 --> 01:19:44,934
Whatever you decide, you have till morning.

740
01:20:06,075 --> 01:20:07,425
Is it over?

741
01:20:08,755 --> 01:20:10,085
It's over.

742
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:15,065
Clay!

743
01:20:19,616 --> 01:20:21,586
You will burn in hell!

744
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:26,626
You will burn in hell! You bitch, you'll burn in hell!

745
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,926
Your turn's coming!

746
01:20:29,466 --> 01:20:31,906
- You will burn in hell!  - You okay?

747
01:20:33,077 --> 01:20:34,447
Holy shit.

748
01:20:48,687 --> 01:20:50,677
Okay, you sure you're still okay about the santa barbara trip?

749
01:20:50,817 --> 01:20:51,847
- Yeah, I'm fine.  - Yeah?

750
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:53,568
And what time should I get you?

751
01:20:53,568 --> 01:20:55,858
It's better if I meet you at the station.

752
01:20:55,998 --> 01:20:57,468
There's something i've gotta do on the way.

753
01:20:57,538 --> 01:20:59,628
I can do it. You want me to do it on my way to...

754
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:02,138
No! No. I've got it under control.

755
01:21:02,838 --> 01:21:05,718
- We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the...  - Wait! Where's my envelope?

756
01:21:05,858 --> 01:21:08,328
- What envelope?  - It was in my purse. I just had it!

757
01:21:08,388 --> 01:21:10,488
- It's just an envelope.  - No, it's gotta be here!

758
01:21:10,559 --> 01:21:13,509
It's here, so we'll find it eventually.

759
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:15,509
- Oh, my god.  - Okay.

760
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:18,239
I thought I'd lost it. Okay.

761
01:21:19,579 --> 01:21:21,579
Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.

762
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,120
Dad, can we go to the angel game?

763
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:46,270
What about the dodgers?

764
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:47,270
We're only gonna be in town for a few days.

765
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:52,311
I'm sure if I just tell him how much I care about you,

766
01:21:52,451 --> 01:21:54,761
I mean, he's gotta understand.

767
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:00,771
Are you sure you don't want anything else?

768
01:22:00,841 --> 01:22:01,841
No.

769
01:22:01,981 --> 01:22:05,111
So you're just gonna sit here drinking coffee all night long.

770
01:22:05,191 --> 01:22:08,451
Yes. Maybe! What's it to you?

771
01:22:08,522 --> 01:22:12,762
Honey, I make my money on tips. Coffee drinkers don't tip.

772
01:22:12,872 --> 01:22:13,132
Honey,

773
01:22:13,132 --> 01:22:16,772
Just keep the coffee coming or i'll give you a tip you won't forget.

774
01:22:58,644 --> 01:23:02,374
Oh, my gosh. What a delightful surprise.

775
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:06,045
You're the sweetest person in the world.

776
01:23:08,735 --> 01:23:10,395
Never mind what it's about, Stu.

777
01:23:10,505 --> 01:23:12,475
Just get here in 10 minutes or I'm gonna tell mr Jacks

778
01:23:12,575 --> 01:23:14,765
Something you don't want me to tell him.

779
01:23:14,855 --> 01:23:17,185
Oh, yeah? Like what?

780
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:21,255
Well, for starters, that you stole the Mcpherson loan file off my desk

781
01:23:21,356 --> 01:23:24,706
And gave it to First National. Now you got nine minutes!

782
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:31,886
- Give me another.  - Seriously?

783
01:23:40,237 --> 01:23:42,807
Oh, god, Christine, please don't tell on me.

784
01:23:42,807 --> 01:23:45,007
I mean, if my dad ever finds out...

785
01:23:45,077 --> 01:23:48,387
- Just tell me what you want.  - I need to give something to you.

786
01:23:48,497 --> 01:23:50,587
- A little gift.  - A gift?

787
01:23:52,067 --> 01:23:54,357
But I don't understand. I thought you called me down here

788
01:23:54,437 --> 01:23:56,347
Because I gave that loan to first national...

789
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:59,577
Look, you don't need to understand. Just shut up!

790
01:24:01,518 --> 01:24:03,748
Now, this gift that I'm giving you, it'll become your property.

791
01:24:03,858 --> 01:24:06,458
You'll be the owner, all right?

792
01:24:09,298 --> 01:24:10,598
Okay.

793
01:24:15,988 --> 01:24:17,108
Okay.

794
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:21,629
What?

795
01:24:23,069 --> 01:24:24,129
Forget it.

796
01:24:25,509 --> 01:24:27,629
But I thought you wanted to give it to me 'cause of the loan Stuff.

797
01:24:27,739 --> 01:24:29,119
Just leave.

798
01:24:32,259 --> 01:24:35,189
Okay. Thank you so much, Christine.

799
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,640
- But you're not gonna tell my dad, right?  - Go!

800
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:44,800
Okay.

801
01:24:55,741 --> 01:24:57,731
Who does deserve this?

802
01:25:18,632 --> 01:25:20,722
Well? Is it possible?

803
01:25:21,972 --> 01:25:25,032
There are gypsy blessings bestowed upon the dead.

804
01:25:25,142 --> 01:25:27,242
They give gifts to their departed

805
01:25:27,382 --> 01:25:31,652
To curry favour with the deceased's soul, for, truly, the soul never dies.

806
01:25:33,493 --> 01:25:38,493
Yes. I do believe you can give the curse to someone who has passed on,

807
01:25:38,843 --> 01:25:40,493
But you must make a formal gift

808
01:25:40,543 --> 01:25:42,303
Of the accursed object to the deceased.

809
01:25:42,423 --> 01:25:44,113
I'll do better than that.

810
01:25:44,423 --> 01:25:46,113
I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!

811
01:25:46,793 --> 01:25:48,193
I'm gonna get some...

812
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:37,059
I'm giving it back to you!

813
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:41,209
You're gonna take this thing.

814
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:45,250
Are you gonna take this thing?

815
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:49,190
Take it!

816
01:28:02,341 --> 01:28:05,171
That's the last of my hair you're getting!

817
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:16,621
I, Christine Brown, do hereby make a formal gift of this button

818
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:19,041
To you, Sylvia Ganush!

819
01:28:20,942 --> 01:28:22,882
Choke on it, bitch!

820
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:39,383
Goodbye.

821
01:30:08,887 --> 01:30:11,857
Hi, it's Christine. Leave a message and I'll call you back.

822
01:30:12,598 --> 01:30:14,928
Christine, it's Jim Jim Jacks.

823
01:30:15,038 --> 01:30:16,398
I'm sorry I'm calling so early,

824
01:30:16,468 --> 01:30:17,288
But last night,

825
01:30:17,288 --> 01:30:21,048
I found some troubling information about our friend Stu rubin.

826
01:30:21,318 --> 01:30:24,778
Apparently, he stole your file on the Mcpherson loan

827
01:30:24,888 --> 01:30:28,218
And then tried to broker his own deal at first national.

828
01:30:28,288 --> 01:30:30,268
I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.

829
01:30:30,339 --> 01:30:32,999
And we wouldn't have either, except that an hour ago,

830
01:30:33,109 --> 01:30:36,909
He came by my house and tried to pin the whole thing on you.

831
01:30:37,989 --> 01:30:41,519
After I confronted him about a few inconsistencies in his story,

832
01:30:41,629 --> 01:30:46,009
He broke down crying and, well, we won't be seeing him around any more.

833
01:30:47,139 --> 01:30:50,369
So I just wanted you to know that, come monday morning,

834
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:54,220
That assistant manager's position will be waiting for you.

835
01:31:06,051 --> 01:31:08,481
Passenger Benson, please meet your party

836
01:31:08,551 --> 01:31:10,651
At the concourse ticket counter.

837
01:31:13,331 --> 01:31:14,771
- Welcome to union station.  - Cookie, miss?

838
01:31:14,871 --> 01:31:16,431
- No, thanks.  - We appreciate you choosing

839
01:31:16,541 --> 01:31:19,231
Train travel as your mode of transportation,

840
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:21,541
And we wish you a pleasant journey.

841
01:31:35,152 --> 01:31:36,812
Hi. Good morning.

842
01:31:37,152 --> 01:31:40,322
- I'm sorry, we're not open.  - I just... I just want this coat.

843
01:31:40,462 --> 01:31:41,482
We're not open yet.

844
01:31:41,622 --> 01:31:45,662
My boyfriend and I are taking this really special trip this morning.

845
01:31:47,013 --> 01:31:48,103
Please?

846
01:31:50,953 --> 01:31:53,863
Northbound Surfliner, service to Van Nuys,

847
01:31:54,023 --> 01:31:56,963
Simi Valley, Oxnard, Santa Barbara,

848
01:31:57,033 --> 01:31:58,963
- San Luis Obispo...  - Clay?

849
01:31:59,043 --> 01:32:01,533
Hey! Oh, man! Have a body

850
01:32:01,644 --> 01:32:04,044
God, I'm so glad you're here. So many things I wanna tell you.

851
01:32:04,184 --> 01:32:05,304
Wait, there's something I wanna say

852
01:32:05,384 --> 01:32:08,324
- While I have it straight in my head.  - Okay. Go ahead.

853
01:32:08,394 --> 01:32:10,864
You never stopped believing in me.

854
01:32:11,694 --> 01:32:13,394
Thank you for that.

855
01:32:14,704 --> 01:32:19,244
And there's something else, something that I couldn't admit to before.

856
01:32:19,914 --> 01:32:24,864
I could have given mrs Ganush another extension on her loan, but I didn't.

857
01:32:27,035 --> 01:32:30,565
It was my decision, and it was wrong of me.

858
01:32:40,636 --> 01:32:42,566
You have such a good heart.

859
01:32:45,106 --> 01:32:46,636
You're so beautiful right now.

860
01:32:49,326 --> 01:32:51,756
- Do you like my new coat?  - I do. I really do.

861
01:32:51,826 --> 01:32:53,486
- What happened to the old one, though?  - I threw it out.

862
01:32:53,626 --> 01:32:56,266
- And I never want to see it again.  - Oh, no.

863
01:32:56,506 --> 01:33:00,336
That's too bad, because I... Look what I found. I found this in the car.

864
01:33:00,807 --> 01:33:02,177
I thought...

865
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:05,127
And I thought maybe you could...

866
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:08,117
I thought maybe you could sew it back on.

867
01:33:08,197 --> 01:33:11,357
And I think you might have my standing liberty quarter,

868
01:33:11,497 --> 01:33:14,037
'Cause the envelopes kind of look the same.

869
01:33:14,147 --> 01:33:16,637
Chris, what's wrong?

870
01:33:17,648 --> 01:33:19,978
- Oh, my god!  - Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

871
01:33:20,658 --> 01:33:22,458
- Oh, my god!  - Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

872
01:33:22,568 --> 01:33:24,898
Stop! Chris! Oh, god!

873
01:33:26,138 --> 01:33:30,478
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, no! Hey! Oh, god, no!

874
01:33:35,589 --> 01:33:37,259
Hey, no!

875
01:33:43,009 --> 01:33:44,269
Help me!

876
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,019
Help me!

877
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:52,449
Help me!

878
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,290
Help me, please!
