1
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,513
I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

2
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:22,849
It was a Horn & Hardart cafeteria.

3
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:27,525
And this beautiful girl walked in,
and I turned to Arthur

4
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:32,729
and I said "Arthur, you see that girl?
I'm going to marry her."

5
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:35,487
And two weeks later we were married.

6
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:38,951
And it's over 50 years later,

7
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:41,320
and we're still married.

8
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:49,995
~ It's very clear

9
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:51,956
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - 1977

10
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:55,374
~ Our love is here to stay

11
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:57,756
- I love you.
- I love you.

12
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:01,753
~ Not for a year

13
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:05,838
~ But ever and a day

14
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:12,896
~ Oh, the radio and the telephone

15
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:16,557
~ And the movies that we know

16
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,522
~ May just be passing fancies...

17
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:35,372
Hi, Sally. Sally, this is Harry Burns.

18
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:38,867
- Harry, this is Sally Albright.
- Nice to meet you.

19
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,453
- Wanna drive the first shift?
- You're there already. You start.

20
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,829
Back's open.

21
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:48,425
- Call me.
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.

22
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,630
- Call me from the road.
- I'll call you before that.

23
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:55,882
- I love you.
- I love you.

24
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:02,184
Sorry.

25
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,099
- I miss you already. I miss you already.
- I miss you.

26
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,429
- Bye.
- Bye.

27
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:10,313
~ In time, the Rockies may crumble

28
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:13,195
~ Gibraltar may tumble

29
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,444
~ They only made of clay

30
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:17,862
~ But

31
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:23,281
~ Our love is here to stay

32
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:29,406
I have it all figured out. It's an 18-hour trip,
which becomes six shifts of three hours.

33
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,206
Or, alternatively,
we could break it down by mileage.

34
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:37,037
There's a... There's a map on the visor

35
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:41,087
that I've marked to show the locations
where we can change shifts.

36
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:43,091
Grape?

37
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,711
No. I don't like to eat between meals.

38
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,591
I'll roll down the window.

39
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:03,234
Why don't you tell me
the story of your life?

40
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:09,447
- The story of my life?
- We got 18 hours to kill before New York.

41
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:13,441
That won't even get us out of Chicago.
Nothing's happened to me yet.

42
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:16,114
- So I'm going to New York.
- So something'll happen?

43
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,657
- Yes.
- Like what?

44
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,280
Like I'm going to journalism school.

45
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:24,330
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

46
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,413
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens.

47
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,295
Suppose you never meet anybody,
you never become anything,

48
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:37,046
then you die and nobody notices for two
weeks until the smell drifts into the hall.

49
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:42,764
- Amanda said you had a dark side.
- That's what drew her to me.

50
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,225
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?

51
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:50,059
I know, you probably
dot your "i"s with little hearts.

52
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:52,858
I have just as much of a
dark side as the next person.

53
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:56,518
Oh, really? When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

54
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:59,440
That way, if I die before I finish
I know how it ends.

55
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,979
That, my friend, is a dark side.

56
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:06,694
That doesn't mean you're deep.
I mean, yes, basically I'm a happy person.

57
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,401
- So am I.
- I don't see anything wrong with that.

58
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:12,740
No, you're too busy being happy.
Ever think about death?

59
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,080
- Yes.
- Sure you do. A fleeting thought

60
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:18,625
that drifts in and out of the transom
of your mind. I spend days.

61
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:20,793
And this makes you a better person?

62
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,705
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared and you're not.

63
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,088
In the meantime, you're gonna
ruin your whole life waiting for it.

64
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:39,428
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong. He wants her to leave.

65
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,728
- That's why he puts her on the plane.
- She doesn't want to stay!

66
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:47,103
Of course she wants to stay! Wouldn't you
rather be with Bogart than the other guy?

67
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:52,394
I don't wanna spend my life in Casablanca
married to a man who runs a bar.

68
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,986
That probably sounds snobbish
to you, but I don't.

69
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:58,531
- You'd rather be in a loveless marriage...
- And First Lady of Czechoslovakia.

70
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,697
..than with the man you had
the greatest sex of your life with,

71
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:04,581
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

72
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:06,118
Yes.

73
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:09,701
And so would any woman in
her right mind. Women are practical,

74
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:14,829
even Ingrid Bergman, which is why she
gets on the plane at the end of the movie.

75
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,834
I understand.

76
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:22,424
- What? What?
- Nothing.

77
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,929
- What?
- Forget about it.

78
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,512
- Forget about what?
- It's not important.

79
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,681
No, just tell me.

80
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:33,146
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

81
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,513
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

82
00:07:35,637 --> 00:07:37,772
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

83
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:41,600
It just so happens that
I have had plenty of good sex.

84
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:02,242
With whom?

85
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:06,042
- What?
- With whom did you have this great sex?

86
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:08,295
I'm not gonna tell you that!

87
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,343
Fine. Don't tell me.

88
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:19,547
- Shel Gordon.
- Shel. Sheldon?

89
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:23,017
No. No, you did not have
great sex with Sheldon.

90
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,849
- I did, too.
- No, you didn't.

91
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:30,439
A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you
need a root canal, Sheldon's your man.

92
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:33,733
But humpin' is not Sheldon's strong suit.
It's the name.

93
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:38,523
"Do it to me, Sheldon." "You're an animal,
Sheldon." "Ride me, big Sheldon."

94
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:41,658
- It doesn't work.
- Hi.

95
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:44,240
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number three.

96
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:49,576
The chef's salad with the oil and vinegar
on the side. And the apple pie ?la mode.

97
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,993
Chef and apple ?la mode.

98
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,791
But I'd like the pie heated
and I want the ice cream on the side.

99
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,630
I'd like strawberry, if you have it. If not,
then whipped cream, but only if it's real.

100
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:03,467
If it's out of a can, nothing.

101
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:07,508
- Not even the pie?
- No, just the pie, but then not heated.

102
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,889
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

103
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:22,474
- How come you broke up with Sheldon?
- How do you know we broke up?

104
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:27,899
If you didn't, you wouldn't be with me.
You'd be with Shel the Wonder Schlong.

105
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:31,398
First of all, I am not with you.

106
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:35,114
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

107
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:38,778
You're right, you're right.
I don't wanna know.

108
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:46,035
Well, it was because he was jealous and
I had these days-of-the-week underpants.

109
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,369
Sorry, I need a judge's ruling on this.

110
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,042
- Days-of-the-week underpants?
- Yes.

111
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:55,459
They had days of the week on them
and I thought they were funny.

112
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:59,210
Then one day Sheldon says to me
"You never wear Sunday."

113
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:02,382
He's all suspicious.
Where had I left Sunday?

114
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:04,674
And I told him and he didn't believe me.

115
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:08,060
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

116
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,555
- Why not?
- Because of God.

117
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,106
OK, so 15 % of my share is 90.

118
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,063
$6.90.

119
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:28,191
Let's leave seven.

120
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:33,072
What?

121
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:36,574
Do I have something on my face?

122
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,875
You're a very attractive person.

123
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,245
Thank you.

124
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:45,587
Amanda never said
how attractive you were.

125
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:48,385
Maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.

126
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:53,254
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

127
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,680
Amanda is my friend.

128
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,267
So?

129
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,228
- So you're going with her.
- So?

130
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:03,512
So you're coming on to me!

131
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:06,597
No, I wasn't.

132
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,817
What?

133
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:13,233
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

134
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:14,775
All right, all right.

135
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:19,568
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

136
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,699
What d'you want me to do about it?
I take it back, OK? I take it back.

137
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:25,288
You can't take it back.

138
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:28,083
- Why not?
- Because it's already out there.

139
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:31,660
What are we supposed to do?
Call the cops, it's already out there!

140
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,832
Just let it lie.

141
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:39,707
- OK?
- Great! "Let it lie." That's my policy.

142
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:42,927
That's what I always say: "Let it lie."

143
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,797
Wanna spend the night in a motel?

144
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,970
- See? I didn't let it lie.
- Harry.

145
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:49,138
I said I would, then I didn't.

146
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:50,891
- Harry!
- What?

147
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:53,426
We are just going to be friends, OK?

148
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,183
Great! Friends! It's the best thing.

149
00:11:57,637 --> 00:12:00,436
You realise
that we could never be friends.

150
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:03,319
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

151
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:06,404
and this is not a come-on
in any way, shape or form,

152
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,441
is that men and women can't be friends,
cos the sex part always gets in the way.

153
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,281
That's not true. I have a number of
men friends and there is no sex involved.

154
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,529
- You don't.
- I do.

155
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,864
- You don't.
- I do!

156
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:21,245
You only think you do.

157
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:23,617
I have sex with them
without my knowledge?

158
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,086
No, they all wanna have sex with you.

159
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:28,791
- They do not.
- Do, too.

160
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:30,916
- They do not.
- Do, too.

161
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,047
How do you know?

162
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:35,295
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

163
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,133
He always wants to have sex with her.

164
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:42,392
So you're saying a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

165
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:45,555
No, you pretty much
wanna nail them, too.

166
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:49,305
What if they don't wanna have sex?

167
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:54,943
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

168
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,613
- I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

169
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,696
That's too bad.

170
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,741
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

171
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:07,485
~ You say ee-ther, I say either

172
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:11,404
~ You say nee-ther and I say neither

173
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,284
~ Ee-ther, either

174
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:15,291
~ And nee-ther, neither

175
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:18,621
~ Let's call the whole thing off

176
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:23,214
~ Yes, you like potato and I like pot-ahto

177
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,125
~ You like tomato, I like tom-ahto

178
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,135
~ Potato, pot-ahto

179
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:31,256
~ Tomato, tom-ahto

180
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,426
~ Let's call the whole thing off

181
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,312
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah. It was interesting.

182
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:49,528
- It was nice knowing you.
- Yeah.

183
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:02,367
- Well, have a nice life.
- You, too.

184
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,199
~ You like potato and I like pot-ahto

185
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:10,284
~ You like tomato, I like tom-ahto

186
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,247
~ Potato, pot-ahto

187
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:14,420
~ Tomato, tom-ahto

188
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,550
~ Let's call the whole thing off

189
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:24,051
- We fell in love in high school.
- Yeah, we were high-school sweethearts.

190
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,431
But then after our junior year
his parents moved away.

191
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:31,687
- But I never forgot her.
- He never forgot me.

192
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:35,181
No, her face was burned on my brain.

193
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:38,933
And it was 34 years later
that I was walking down Broadway

194
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:41,192
and I saw her come out of Toffenetti's.

195
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,194
We both looked at each other,

196
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:47,699
and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

197
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:51,823
She was just as beautiful
as she was at sixteen.

198
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,195
He was just the same.

199
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,572
He looked exactly the same.

200
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:04,753
FIVE YEARS LATER

201
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,938
Joe! I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

202
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,109
- Harry Burns.
- Harry. How ya doin'?

203
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:37,274
- Good. How you doin'?
- Fine. I'm doin' fine.

204
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,779
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

205
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,486
Yeah, it was.

206
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,698
- You still with the DA's office?
- No, I switched to the other side. You?

207
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:50,243
I work with a small firm. We do
political consulting. Yeah, it's great.

208
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,037
Harry, this is Sally Albright. Harry Burns.

209
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:58,249
Harry and I, we used to...
We lived in the same building.

210
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,881
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was good to see you, Joe. Bye.

211
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:16,515
Thank God he couldn't place me. I drove
to New York with him five years ago

212
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,647
and it was the longest night of my life.

213
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,109
- What happened?
- He made a pass at me. When I said no:

214
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:27,320
he was going with a girlfriend of mine...

215
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:31,323
Oh, God. I can't remember her name.

216
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:35,399
Don't get involved with me. I am 26
and can't remember the name of the girl

217
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:39,404
I was such good friends with
I wouldn't get involved with her boyfriend.

218
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:41,579
- So what happened?
- When?

219
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:44,911
When he made a pass, you said no...

220
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:47,666
I said we could just be friends.

221
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:53,217
And this part I remember. He said men
and women could never really be friends.

222
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,549
Do you think that's true?

223
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:57,627
No.

224
00:16:57,876 --> 00:17:00,556
Do you have any women friends,
just friends?

225
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:02,760
No.

226
00:17:02,963 --> 00:17:05,927
But I will get one if it's important to you.

227
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:09,893
Amanda Reese!

228
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:12,311
That was her name. Thank God.

229
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,058
I will miss you. I love you.

230
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,110
- You do?
- Yes.

231
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:23,404
I love you.

232
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:49,464
- What would you like to drink?
- Nothing, thanks.

233
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:51,588
- D'you have any Bloody Mary mix?
- Yes.

234
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:56,763
No, wait. Here's what I want. Regular
tomato juice, fill it up three quarters,

235
00:17:56,881 --> 00:18:01,636
then add a splash of Bloody Mary mix -
just a splash - and some lime on the side.

236
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,013
The University of Chicago, right?

237
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:08,809
- Yes.
- Did you look this good at university?

238
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:11,352
- No.
- Did we ever...?

239
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,527
No. No!

240
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:18,368
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

241
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:22,075
- Would you two like to sit together?
- Great! Thank you.

242
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,540
You were a good friend of...

243
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:34,789
Amanda's. I can't believe
you can't remember her name.

244
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:37,415
What do you mean?
I can remember. Amanda Rice.

245
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:40,219
- Reese.
- Reese, right. What happened to her?

246
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,043
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?!

247
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:46,844
You were friends. We didn't make it
because you were such good friends.

248
00:18:46,963 --> 00:18:48,848
- You went with her!
- Was it worth it?

249
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:51,468
The sacrifice, for a friend
you no longer see?

250
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:53,892
Harry, you might not believe this,

251
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,936
but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

252
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,027
Fair enough. Fair enough.

253
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,397
- You wanted to be a gymnast.
- Journalist.

254
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,232
- That's what I said. And?
- I am a journalist. I work at The News.

255
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,693
Great. And you're with Joe.

256
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:15,580
Well, that's great. Great.

257
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,576
You're together, what, three weeks?

258
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,625
- A month. How did you know?
- You take someone to the airport,

259
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:28,506
it's the beginning of a relationship. That
is why I never do that at the beginning.

260
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:31,338
- Why?
- Because eventually things move on

261
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:34,718
and you don't take someone.
I never wanted anyone to say

262
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:38,380
"How come you never take me
to the airport any more?"

263
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:43,473
It's amazing. You look normal,
but actually you are the Angel of Death.

264
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,761
Are you gonna marry him?

265
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:51,600
We have known each other a month and
neither of us wants to marry right now.

266
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,478
I'm getting married.

267
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,769
You are?

268
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:58,146
- You are?
- Yeah.

269
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:03,029
- Who is she?
- Helen Hillson. She's keeping her name.

270
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:06,783
- You're getting married.
- Yeah.

271
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:10,743
What's so funny about that?

272
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:15,210
It's just... It's just
so optimistic of you, Harry.

273
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:18,254
You'd be amazed what
falling madly in love can do for you.

274
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:21,796
Well, it's wonderful.
It's nice to see you embracing life.

275
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:26,005
Yeah. Plus, you get to a certain point
where you get tired of the whole thing.

276
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,588
- What whole thing?
- The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

277
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:33,969
You meet someone, you have the safe
lunch, you decide to move on to dinner.

278
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,387
You go dancing,
you do the white man's overbite,

279
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:42,059
go back to her place, have sex, and then
you know what goes through your mind?

280
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,773
"How long do I have to lie here
and hold her before I can go home?"

281
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,942
"Is 30 seconds enough?"

282
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,906
That's what you're thinking? Is that true?

283
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,439
Sure. All men think that.

284
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:56,778
How long do you like to be
held afterwards? All night, right?

285
00:20:57,108 --> 00:21:01,366
That's the problem. Somewhere between
30 seconds and all night is your problem.

286
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:03,954
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

287
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,545
- Staying over?
- Yes.

288
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,299
Would you like to have dinner?
Just friends.

289
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,842
You don't believe
men and women can be friends.

290
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:30,266
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

291
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:32,638
No, no, no, no, I never said that.

292
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:37,057
Yes, that's right. They can't be friends.

293
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:41,772
Unless both are involved with someone.
Then they can. I amend the earlier rule.

294
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:47,243
If two people are in relationships, the
pressure of possible involvement is lifted.

295
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:50,618
That doesn't work either.
The person you're with can't see

296
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:53,201
why you need to be friends
with the person,

297
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,831
like it means something
is missing from the relationship.

298
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,743
Then when you say "No, nothing
is missing", the person you're with

299
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:04,828
accuses you of being attracted
to the person you're just friends with,

300
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:07,717
which you probably are.
I mean, let's face it.

301
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:10,250
So we're back to the rule
before the amendment:

302
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,138
men and women can't be friends.
Where's it leave us?

303
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:14,675
- Harry.
- What?

304
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:16,799
Goodbye.

305
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:18,760
OK.

306
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:28,483
I'll just stop walking. I'll let you go ahead.

307
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,653
We were married 40 years ago.

308
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:38,481
We were married three years,
we got a divorce. Then I married Marjorie.

309
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:41,155
- First you lived with Barbara.
- Right, Barbara.

310
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,824
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

311
00:22:43,943 --> 00:22:47,157
- Then you got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

312
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,915
Another divorce.

313
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:54,000
Then a couple of years later at
Eddie Collecio's funeral, I ran into her.

314
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:56,834
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

315
00:22:56,954 --> 00:22:59,717
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

316
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:02,250
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

317
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,672
I remember I snuck over to her
and I said...

318
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:08,925
- What did I say?
- You said "What are you doin' after?"

319
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:13,637
Right. So I ditch Roberta, we go
for coffee, a month later we're married.

320
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,855
35 years to the day
after our first marriage.

321
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:22,109
- I went through his pockets.
- Marie, why?

322
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:23,434
FIVE YEARS LATER

323
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:26,107
- You know what I found?
- No, what?

324
00:23:26,227 --> 00:23:30,402
They just bought a dining-room table.
His wife just spent $1 ,600 on a table.

325
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:33,369
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

326
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:35,618
The point is he's never gonna leave her.

327
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:38,284
What else is new?
You've known this for two years.

328
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,913
You're right. I know you're right.

329
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:45,170
Can't you find someone single? When I
was single I knew lots of nice single men.

330
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:47,964
There must be someone.
Sally found someone.

331
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,378
Sally got the last good one.

332
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,381
- Joe and I broke up.
- What?

333
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,087
- When?
- Monday.

334
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,426
- You waited three days?
- Joe's available?

335
00:23:56,543 --> 00:24:00,765
For God's sake, Marie, don't you
have feelings? She's obviously upset.

336
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,892
I'm not that upset.
We'd been growing apart for a while.

337
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,477
But you were a couple.

338
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:09,387
You had someone to go places with.
You had a date on national holidays!

339
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:13,146
I said to myself "You deserve
more than this. You're 31 ..."

340
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:17,653
- And the clock is ticking.
- No, it doesn't start to tick until you're 36.

341
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:20,068
God, you're in such great shape.

342
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:24,362
Well, I've had a few days
to get used to it, and I feel OK.

343
00:24:24,482 --> 00:24:26,700
Good. Then you're ready.

344
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:31,371
- Really, Marie!
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

345
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:35,199
I've got the perfect guy.
I don't find him attractive, but you might.

346
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:37,411
She doesn't have a problem with chins.

347
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:41,294
- Marie, I'm not ready yet.
- But you just said you were over him.

348
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:44,875
I am over him,
but I'm in a mourning period.

349
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,878
- Who is it?
- Alex Anderson.

350
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,839
You fixed me up with him six years ago.

351
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:56,467
Sorry. God.

352
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:59,094
All right, wait. Here. Here we go.

353
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:02,811
- Ken Darman.
- He's been married for over a year.

354
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:05,189
Really?

355
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:07,357
Married.

356
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:09,609
- Wait. Wait, I got one.
- Look,

357
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:14,233
there is no point going out with someone
I might like if I met him at the right time,

358
00:25:14,355 --> 00:25:18,067
but who right now would
just be a transitional man.

359
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:22,829
OK, but don't wait too long. Remember
what happened with David Warsaw?

360
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:27,700
His wife left him and everyone said "Give
him some time. Don't move in too fast."

361
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:30,285
Six months later he was dead.

362
00:25:30,493 --> 00:25:34,122
Are you saying I should marry quickly
in case he's about to die?

363
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,713
At least you could say you were married.

364
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:42,216
I'm saying that the right man is out there.
If you don't grab him, someone else will,

365
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:48,052
and you'll spend your life knowing that
someone else is married to your husband.

366
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,512
Ten! Hut!

367
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:11,900
- When did this happen?
- Friday. Helen comes home from work

368
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:15,489
and she says "I don't know
if I wanna be married any more."

369
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:21,127
Like it's the institution. Nothing personal,
just something she's been thinking about.

370
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:25,879
I'm calm. I say "Why don't we take time to
think about it? Don't rush into anything."

371
00:26:25,995 --> 00:26:29,173
- Yeah, right.
- Next day she says she's thought about it.

372
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,717
She wants a trial separation.
She just wants to try it.

373
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:36,179
But we can still date -
like this is supposed to cushion the blow.

374
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:40,470
I got married so I could stop dating,
so still dating is not a big incentive

375
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,266
since the last thing you wanna do
is date your wife, who should love you.

376
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:48,061
Which is what I'm saying to her,
when it occurs to me maybe she doesn't.

377
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,979
So I say to her
"Don't you love me any more?"

378
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:54,562
D'you know what she says?
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

379
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:58,741
That's harsh. You don't
bounce back from that right away.

380
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:01,867
- Thanks, Jess.
- No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.

381
00:27:01,982 --> 00:27:03,618
That's particularly harsh.

382
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:07,031
Then she says someone in her office
is going to South America

383
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:11,791
and she can sublet his apartment.
I can't believe this. And the doorbell rings.

384
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:16,331
"I can sublet his apartment" - the words
still hang in the air like in a balloon...

385
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:18,088
- Like a cartoon.
- Right.

386
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:23,172
So I go to the door and there are moving
men there. Now I start to get suspicious.

387
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:27,051
I say "Helen, when did you call
these movers?" She doesn't say anything.

388
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:30,016
So I ask the movers
"When did this woman book you?"

389
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:35,218
And they're three huge guys. One with
a T-shirt saying "Don't fuck with Mr Zero."

390
00:27:35,342 --> 00:27:40,893
So I said "Helen, when did you make this
arrangement?" She says "A week ago."

391
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:44,227
I said "You've known for a week
and you didn't tell me?"

392
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:47,729
And she says
"I didn't wanna ruin your birthday."

393
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:53,193
Mr Zero knew you were getting
a divorce a week before you?

394
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:55,284
- Mr Zero knew.
- I can't believe this!

395
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,788
- I haven't told you the bad part yet.
- What's worse than Mr Zero knowing?

396
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:01,954
It's all a lie.

397
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,705
She's in love with somebody else.
Some tax attorney.

398
00:28:06,826 --> 00:28:10,835
- She moved in with him.
- How did you find out?

399
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:13,254
I followed her. Stood outside the building.

400
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:16,171
- That's so humiliating!
- Tell me about it.

401
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:20,763
And, you know, I knew. I knew that even
though we were happy, it was an illusion.

402
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:23,381
And that one day
she'd kick the shit outta me.

403
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:28,854
Marriages don't break up due to infidelity.
It's a symptom something else is wrong.

404
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:32,141
Oh, really?
Well, that symptom is fucking my wife!

405
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:39,861
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

406
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:43,112
What do you mean
"just happened" to see it?

407
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,192
Well, he was shaving,
and there it was in his briefcase.

408
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:49,949
What if he came out and saw you?

409
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:52,950
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

410
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:58,242
He just spent $1 20
on a new nightgown for his wife.

411
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:04,207
- I don't think he's ever gonna leave her.
- No one thinks he's ever gonna leave her.

412
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,841
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

413
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:26,306
Someone is staring at you
in Personal Growth.

414
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,444
I know him. You'd like him. He's married.

415
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:37,367
- Who is he?
- Harry Burns. He's a political consultant.

416
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,195
He's cute.

417
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:42,696
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

418
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:44,989
Last time I saw him
he was getting married.

419
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:48,208
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

420
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:51,287
So he might not be married any more.

421
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,378
Also, he's obnoxious.

422
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:57,752
It's like in The Lady Vanishes, when she
says "You're the most obnoxious man",...

423
00:29:57,872 --> 00:30:01,086
- "The most contemptible".
- ..then they fall madly in love.

424
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:04,719
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

425
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,723
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

426
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:11,472
It is. This is Marie.

427
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:14,765
Was Marie.

428
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:16,937
- How are you?
- Fine.

429
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:19,901
- How's Joe?
- Fine.

430
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:22,150
I hear he's fine.

431
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:25,694
- You're not with Joe any more?
- We just broke up.

432
00:30:27,146 --> 00:30:29,364
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

433
00:30:30,231 --> 00:30:32,816
Yeah. Well, you know.

434
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:34,365
Yeah.

435
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:36,536
So...

436
00:30:36,653 --> 00:30:38,657
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

437
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,831
How's married life?

438
00:30:41,949 --> 00:30:43,704
I'm getting a divorce.

439
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,955
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

440
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:52,469
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

441
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,219
What happened with you guys?

442
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:58,545
When Joe and I started seeing each other
we wanted the same thing.

443
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:02,976
We didn't wanna get married because
every time anyone we knew got married

444
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:07,182
it ruined their relationship.
They practically never had sex again.

445
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:10,979
It's true. That's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

446
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:16,695
I would sit with my girlfriends who have
kids... my one girlfriend with kids, Alice,

447
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,985
and she would complain about
how she and Gary never did it any more.

448
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:24,532
She didn't even complain about it.
She said it matter-of-factly.

449
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,161
She said they were up all night,
they were both exhausted,

450
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:31,990
the kids took every sexual impulse
they had out of them.

451
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:38,413
Joe and I would say "We're so lucky.
We have this wonderful relationship."

452
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:42,794
"We can have sex on the kitchen floor
and not worry about the kids walking in."

453
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:46,756
"We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

454
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:51,091
Then one day I was taking
Alice's girl for the afternoon

455
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:56,811
cos I promised to take her to the circus.
We were in the cab playing I-spy.

456
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:59,605
"I spy a mailbox", "I spy a lamppost".

457
00:32:00,178 --> 00:32:03,854
And she looked out the window
and she saw this man and woman

458
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:08,313
with these two little kids, and the man
had one of the kids on his shoulders.

459
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:11,732
And she said "I spy a family."

460
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:17,445
And I started to cry.
You know, I just started crying.

461
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:21,581
And I went home
and I said "The thing is, Joe,

462
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:24,826
we never do fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

463
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:26,787
And the kitchen floor...?

464
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:32,128
Not once. It's this very cold,
hard, Mexican ceramic tile.

465
00:32:34,372 --> 00:32:36,008
Anyway,

466
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:41,555
we talked about it for a long time. I said
"This is what I want" and he said "I don't".

467
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,966
And I said "Well, I guess it's over."
And he left.

468
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,809
And the thing is, I... I feel really fine.

469
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,189
I am over him.
I mean, I really am over him.

470
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:58,519
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

471
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:03,729
And every time I think about it, I am more
and more convinced I did the right thing.

472
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:06,238
Boy, you sound really healthy.

473
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:07,909
Yeah.

474
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:11,696
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me.

475
00:33:11,818 --> 00:33:16,705
But really, what's so hard about finding an
apartment? You read the obituary column.

476
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:20,451
You find out who died, go to the building,
and then you tip the doorman.

477
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:24,714
It'd be easier if they combined
obituaries with the real-estate section.

478
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:28,090
Then you have "Mr Klein died,
leaving a wife, two children

479
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:33,093
and a spacious three-bedroom
apartment with a wood-burning fireplace."

480
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,469
The first time we met
I really didn't like you that much.

481
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,428
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

482
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,977
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

483
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:48,150
I hate that kind of remark. It sounds
like a compliment, but it's an insult.

484
00:33:48,264 --> 00:33:50,399
OK, you're still as hard as nails.

485
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:54,109
I didn't wanna sleep with you
so you wrote it off as a character flaw,

486
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:59,659
instead of dealing with the possibility
it might have something to do with you.

487
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:03,284
What's the statute of limitations
on apologies?

488
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:08,073
- Ten years.
- I can just get it in under the wire.

489
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:15,541
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

490
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:18,498
Are we becoming friends now?

491
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:21,794
Well...

492
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,250
Yeah.

493
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:28,557
Great! A woman friend.

494
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:34,807
You may be the first attractive woman I've
not wanted to sleep with in my entire life.

495
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:37,262
That's wonderful, Harry.

496
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:41,734
- We were born in the same hospital,...
- ln 1921 .

497
00:34:41,848 --> 00:34:44,397
- ..seven days apart.
- ln the same hospital.

498
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:47,648
- We both grew up one block apart.
- We lived in tenements.

499
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,652
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

500
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,868
- I moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

501
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:56,947
- She moved when she was 1 1 .
- I lived on 183rd Street.

502
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:02,323
- She worked on the 1 5th floor as a nurse.
- I worked for a prominent neurologist,...

503
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:05,496
- I had a practice on the 14th floor.
- ..Dr Permelman.

504
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:08,001
- We never met.
- Never met.

505
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,795
- Can you imagine that?
- D'you know where we met? An elevator.

506
00:35:11,914 --> 00:35:14,796
- I was visiting family.
- ln the Ambassador Hotel.

507
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,596
He was on the third floor,
I was on the 1 2th.

508
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,339
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

509
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:23,930
Nine extra floors.

510
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,731
- Hello.
- You sleeping?

511
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:39,614
- No, I was watching "Casablanca".
- Channel?

512
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:42,444
- Eleven.
- Thank you. Got it.

513
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:46,650
So you'd be happier with Victor Laszlo
than with Humphrey Bogart?

514
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:49,871
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

515
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:54,457
- I never said that. I'd never say that.
- All right, fine. Have it your way.

516
00:35:56,324 --> 00:35:58,459
- Have you been sleeping?
- Why?

517
00:35:58,576 --> 00:36:02,502
Cos I haven't been sleeping.
I really miss Helen.

518
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:09,174
Maybe I'm coming down with something. I
watched "Leave It to Beaver" in Spanish.

519
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:13,171
"Buenos días, Seòor Cleaver.
?Dónde están Wallace y Theodore?"

520
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,506
I'm not well.

521
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,598
I went to bed at 7.30.
I haven't done that since third grade.

522
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:21,765
That's the good thing
about depression - you rest.

523
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:24,982
- I'm not depressed.
- OK. Fine.

524
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:27,985
Do you still sleep
on the same side ofthe bed?

525
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,685
I did for a while,
but now I'm using the whole bed.

526
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,779
God, that's great. I feel weird
when just my leg wanders over.

527
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:38,735
I miss her.

528
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:42,451
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

529
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,621
You know what I miss?

530
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:47,038
I miss the idea ofhim.

531
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:51,166
Maybe I only miss the idea ofHelen.

532
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:54,461
No, I miss the whole Helen.

533
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,377
Last scene.

534
00:37:02,544 --> 00:37:05,556
Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

535
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:09,469
lngrid Bergman. She's low maintenance.

536
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:12,176
- Low maintenance?
- There are two kinds of women.

537
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:16,607
- High maintenance and low maintenance.
- And lngrid is low maintenance?

538
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:18,643
An LM, definitely.

539
00:37:18,765 --> 00:37:20,816
- Which one am I?
- The worst kind.

540
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,732
You're high maintenance,
but you think you're low.

541
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:26,022
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

542
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:29,242
"Waiter, a house salad,
but not the regular dressing."

543
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:31,776
"I'll have balsamic vinegar - on the side."

544
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:35,328
"Then salmon with mustard sauce,
but I want the sauce on the side."

545
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:39,287
- "On the side" is a big thing for you.
- I just want it the way I want it.

546
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,458
I know. High maintenance.

547
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:44,713
.. 10,000F should pay our expenses.

548
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:46,879
Our expenses?

549
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:51,384
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

550
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:56,053
Best last line of a movie ever.

551
00:37:58,964 --> 00:38:03,471
I'm definitely coming down with
something. Probably a 24-hour tumour.

552
00:38:03,592 --> 00:38:05,762
- You don't have a tumour.
- How do you know?

553
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:10,938
- If you're so worried, go see a doctor.
- No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

554
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:13,606
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be OK.

555
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:16,987
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

556
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:19,985
Maybe I should practise now.

557
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,909
Good night, Harry.

558
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:30,080
Good night.

559
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:09,775
I had my dream again - where I'm making
love and Olympic judges are watching?

560
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:12,777
I'd nailed the compulsories,
so this is it: the finals.

561
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:16,361
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American,

562
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:20,030
and my mother, disguised as
an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

563
00:39:20,153 --> 00:39:22,453
Must've been the dismount.

564
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:25,786
Basically it's the same one
I've had since I was 1 2.

565
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,671
- What happens?
- No, it's... It's too embarrassing.

566
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,169
- Don't tell me.
- OK, there's this guy.

567
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:34,963
- What's he look like?
- I don't know. He's just kinda faceless.

568
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:38,379
A faceless guy. OK. Then what happens?

569
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,588
He rips off my clothes.

570
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:44,767
- Then what happens?
- That's it.

571
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,478
That's it? A faceless guy
rips off your clothes.

572
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:52,851
And that's the sex fantasy you've had
since you were 12. Exactly the same?

573
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:55,734
Well, sometimes I vary it a little.

574
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:58,316
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

575
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:05,821
- What?
- Nothing.

576
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:11,320
I have decided that for today

577
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:14,077
we are going to talk like this.

578
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:17,457
- Like this?
- No. To repeat after me.

579
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:18,665
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

580
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:19,744
- Pepper.
- Pepper!

581
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:20,710
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

582
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:21,539
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

583
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:25,836
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

584
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,928
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

585
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:34,382
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

586
00:40:34,504 --> 00:40:36,176
Oh, no!

587
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:38,348
- But I would be proud.
- But I would be proud.

588
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:39,639
- To partake.
- To partake.

589
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:42,770
- Of your pecan pie.
- Of your pecan pie.

590
00:40:42,886 --> 00:40:44,522
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

591
00:40:44,637 --> 00:40:48,313
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie!

592
00:40:48,474 --> 00:40:51,985
- Would you like to go to the movies?
- Would you like to go...

593
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:58,068
Not to repeat. Please, to answer. Would
you like to go to the movies tonight?

594
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,242
Well, I'd love to, Harry, but I can't.

595
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:05,456
What do you have? A hot date?

596
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,115
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

597
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,498
Yeah. I was gonna tell you,
but, I don't know, I felt strange about it.

598
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,163
- Why?
- Cos we've spent so much time together.

599
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:17,967
I think it's great that you have a date.

600
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:20,132
- You do?
- Yeah.

601
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:29,595
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

602
00:41:29,715 --> 00:41:32,811
Well, I don't know. Why?

603
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:36,930
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

604
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:39,639
- I do?
- Yeah.

605
00:41:41,141 --> 00:41:46,277
I think hieroglyphics are really a comic
strip about a character named Sphinxy.

606
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:49,988
- Harry, you should get out there, too.
- I'm not ready.

607
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:53,617
- You should.
- I would not be good for anybody now.

608
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:55,489
It's time.

609
00:41:55,777 --> 00:41:58,991
It was the most
uncomfortable night of my life.

610
00:41:59,113 --> 00:42:01,164
See, no, it has to go this way.

611
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:05,130
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

612
00:42:05,243 --> 00:42:07,294
You only had one date.

613
00:42:07,412 --> 00:42:10,839
- How do you know it won't get worse?
- How much worse can it get

614
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:16,507
than finishing dinner, having him pull
a hair out of my head and floss with it?

615
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:19,509
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

616
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:23,176
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

617
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:27,011
And we're talking in this Ethiopian
restaurant she wanted to go to.

618
00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:30,563
I was making jokes, like
"I didn't know they had food in Ethiopia."

619
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,440
"This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

620
00:42:34,558 --> 00:42:36,858
Yeah! Nothing from her, not even a smile.

621
00:42:36,977 --> 00:42:40,238
I downshift into small talk
and ask where she went to school.

622
00:42:40,355 --> 00:42:43,569
She says Michigan State.
And this reminds me of Helen.

623
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:46,952
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of an anxiety attack -

624
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:50,080
my heart's beatin' fast
and I start sweatin' like a pig.

625
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:53,160
- Helen went to Michigan State?
- No, Northwestern.

626
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:55,534
But they're both Big Ten schools.

627
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:58,754
I got so upset
I had to leave the restaurant.

628
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,171
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

629
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,547
It might be months before we're able
to enjoy going out with someone new.

630
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,676
Yeah.

631
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:12,091
Maybe longer before we're able
to go to bed with someone new.

632
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:14,549
I went to bed with her.

633
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:18,728
- You went to bed with her?!
- Sure.

634
00:43:24,723 --> 00:43:27,735
- I don't understand this relationship.
- What d'ya mean?

635
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:29,571
- Enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

636
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:31,736
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

637
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:34,072
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

638
00:43:34,189 --> 00:43:36,442
You're afraid to let yourself be happy.

639
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:39,993
Why can't you gimme credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

640
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,989
I never had a relationship with a woman
that didn't involve sex. I'm growing.

641
00:43:44,114 --> 00:43:47,743
- Are you finished?
- I got a stack o' quarters. I was here first.

642
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:48,744
- Were not.
- Was too.

643
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:50,836
- Were not!
- Was too!

644
00:43:50,952 --> 00:43:53,537
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

645
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:55,548
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

646
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:57,301
Yeah.

647
00:43:57,416 --> 00:44:00,630
It's very freeing. I can say anything to her.

648
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:04,591
Are you saying you can say things to her
you can't say to me?

649
00:44:04,713 --> 00:44:09,552
No, it's just a different perspective.
I get the woman's point of view on things.

650
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:13,436
She tells me about the men she sees,
and I talk to her about the women I see.

651
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:15,724
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

652
00:44:15,847 --> 00:44:19,523
Like the other night, I made love
to this woman and it was incredible.

653
00:44:19,642 --> 00:44:23,402
I took her to a place that wasn't human.
She actually meowed.

654
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,027
- You made a woman meow?
- Yeah, and I can say these things to her.

655
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:32,573
And the great thing is, I don't have to lie
because I don't wanna get her into bed.

656
00:44:32,694 --> 00:44:36,750
- I can just be myself.
- You made a woman meow?

657
00:44:37,781 --> 00:44:40,829
What do you do with these women?
Just get up and leave?

658
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:44,378
- Sure.
- Explain how you do it. What do you say?

659
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:47,080
I say I have an early meeting,
early squash game.

660
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:51,511
- You don't play squash.
- They don't know that. They just met me.

661
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:54,473
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

662
00:44:54,586 --> 00:44:56,839
I'm so glad I never got involved with you.

663
00:44:56,963 --> 00:45:00,924
I just would've been some woman you
had to get outta bed and leave at 3am

664
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,311
and go clean your andirons.
You don't even have a fireplace.

665
00:45:04,428 --> 00:45:08,270
- Not that I would know this.
- Why are you upset? This isn't about you.

666
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:12,564
Yes, it is! You are a human affront
to all women, and I am a woman.

667
00:45:12,684 --> 00:45:15,566
Hey, I don't hear anyone complaining.

668
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:18,569
Of course not.
You're out the door too fast.

669
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:22,034
- I think they have an OK time.
- How do you know?

670
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:24,993
What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.

671
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:28,953
- Because they...
- Yes, because they...

672
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:34,661
- How do you know that they're really...
- What're you saying? They fake orgasm?

673
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,496
- It's possible.
- Get outta here!

674
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:40,717
Why? Most women
at one time or another have faked it.

675
00:45:41,124 --> 00:45:44,053
- They haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

676
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,890
Because I know.

677
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:51,634
Right. That's right.

678
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:54,057
I forgot. You're a man.

679
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:56,387
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

680
00:45:56,511 --> 00:46:00,306
All men are sure it never happened
to them and most women have done it,

681
00:46:00,431 --> 00:46:02,482
so you do the math.

682
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,184
You don't think I could tell the difference?

683
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:08,108
- No.
- Get outta here.

684
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:24,203
Are you OK?

685
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:30,172
Oh, God.

686
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,750
Oh, God.

687
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:43,054
Oh, God.

688
00:46:43,173 --> 00:46:44,893
Oh, yeah, right there.

689
00:46:51,471 --> 00:46:53,689
Oh, God.

690
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:56,902
Yes! Yes! Yes!

691
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:58,731
Yes! Yes!

692
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:00,903
Yes!

693
00:47:02,313 --> 00:47:05,277
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

694
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:09,697
Yes! Yes! Yes!

695
00:47:09,819 --> 00:47:12,238
Yes! Yes! Yes!

696
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:18,125
Oh, God.

697
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:29,797
I'll have what she's having.

698
00:47:31,628 --> 00:47:33,881
~ Sleigh bells ring

699
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:35,974
~ Are you listening?

700
00:47:36,382 --> 00:47:40,391
~ ln the lane snow is glistening

701
00:47:40,844 --> 00:47:42,979
~ A beautiful sight

702
00:47:43,096 --> 00:47:45,480
~ We're happy tonight

703
00:47:45,598 --> 00:47:48,646
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

704
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:52,609
~ Gone away is the bluebird

705
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:57,492
~ Here to stay is a new bird

706
00:47:58,441 --> 00:48:02,532
~ He sings a love song as we go along

707
00:48:02,653 --> 00:48:06,365
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

708
00:48:06,781 --> 00:48:10,292
~ ln the meadow we can build a snowman

709
00:48:11,118 --> 00:48:14,913
~ And pretend that he is Parson Brown

710
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:17,210
~ He'll say "Are you married?"

711
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:19,715
~ We'll say "No, man"

712
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:23,712
~ "But you can do thejob
when you're in town, brother"

713
00:48:23,836 --> 00:48:27,975
~ Later on we'll conspire

714
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:32,518
~ As we dream by the fire

715
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:37,441
~ To face unafraid the plans that we made

716
00:48:37,556 --> 00:48:40,403
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

717
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:45,106
~ lf they asked me

718
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:47,695
~ I could write a book

719
00:48:49,357 --> 00:48:53,781
~ About the way you walk and whisper...

720
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:57,697
- I like you with no beard. I see your face.
- It is my face!

721
00:48:58,906 --> 00:49:01,159
Whoa! Dipping you.

722
00:49:04,035 --> 00:49:07,296
- Thank you for taking me out tonight.
- Don't be silly.

723
00:49:07,413 --> 00:49:11,339
The next New Year's Eve, if neither
of us is with anybody, you got a date.

724
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,296
Deal.

725
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:17,466
See? Now we can dance cheek to cheek.

726
00:49:20,298 --> 00:49:22,883
~ lsjust to tell them

727
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:26,105
~ That I love you a lot

728
00:49:27,554 --> 00:49:32,393
~ Then the world discovers

729
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:36,395
~ As my book ends

730
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:40,694
~ How to make two lovers

731
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:42,984
~ Of friends

732
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:46,737
Hey, everybody!
Ten seconds to New Year!

733
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:49,197
- Ten,...
- Wanna get some air?

734
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:52,417
- Yeah.
- ..seven, six, five, four,

735
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:54,868
three, two, one!

736
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,043
Happy New Year!

737
00:50:18,469 --> 00:50:20,604
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

738
00:50:28,144 --> 00:50:33,446
He was a head counsellor at boys' camp,
I was a head counsellor at girls' camp,

739
00:50:33,565 --> 00:50:37,444
and they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

740
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:40,580
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine,

741
00:50:40,695 --> 00:50:44,455
cos people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

742
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,421
But he was coming to talk to me,
and he said

743
00:50:47,534 --> 00:50:50,546
"I'm Ben Small
of the Coney lsland Smalls."

744
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:55,133
At that moment I knew. I knew
the way you know about a good melon.

745
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:59,805
You sent flowers to yourself.

746
00:50:59,919 --> 00:51:03,714
$60 I spent on this big arrangement
of flowers, and I wrote a card

747
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,930
that I planned to leave on the table
where Arthur would just happen to see it.

748
00:51:08,051 --> 00:51:10,387
What did the card say?

749
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:13,096
"Please say yes. Love Jonathan."

750
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:15,391
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

751
00:51:15,515 --> 00:51:19,606
He forgot a charity thing his wife is
chairman of. He's never gonna leave her!

752
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:23,154
- Of course he isn't.
- You're right. I know you're right.

753
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:26,900
- Where is this place?
- Somewhere on the next block.

754
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:28,826
I can't believe I'm doing this.

755
00:51:28,942 --> 00:51:32,453
Harry is one of my best friends
and you are one of my best friends.

756
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,994
And if you two hit it off, we could still
be friends, instead of drifting apart

757
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:40,211
like you do when you date someone
who doesn't know your friends.

758
00:51:40,326 --> 00:51:44,382
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

759
00:51:44,496 --> 00:51:48,125
If Arthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him,

760
00:51:48,249 --> 00:51:51,760
I am sure that you and I would drift apart.

761
00:51:51,877 --> 00:51:53,964
He's never gonna leave her.

762
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:56,174
Of course he isn't.

763
00:51:56,297 --> 00:51:58,432
You're right. I know you're right.

764
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:01,219
- I dunno about this.
- It's just a dinner.

765
00:52:01,343 --> 00:52:06,514
I've finally gotten to a place where I'm
comfortable with just me and my work.

766
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,434
- If she's so great why don't you date her?
- I told you. We're just friends.

767
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,406
- So she's not attractive?
- No, she is attractive.

768
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:18,109
- You said she had a good personality.
- She has a good personality.

769
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,156
What?

770
00:52:21,276 --> 00:52:25,581
When someone's not attractive, they're
described as having a good personality.

771
00:52:25,696 --> 00:52:29,491
If you'd asked about looks and
I'd said "She has a good personality",

772
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:31,417
she's not attractive.

773
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:35,080
But because I mentioned she has
a good personality, she can be either.

774
00:52:35,203 --> 00:52:38,998
Attractive with a good personality,
or not attractive with a good personality.

775
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:41,174
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

776
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,544
But not beautiful, right?

777
00:52:46,212 --> 00:52:51,300
It's like, whenever I read Jimmy Breslin,
it's as if he's leaving a wake-up call

778
00:52:51,425 --> 00:52:55,564
- for the City of New York.
- What d'you mean by a "wake-up call"?

779
00:52:55,678 --> 00:52:59,936
He's saying that we've got people
in the city who are on welfare...

780
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:03,400
Would I have seen any of your windows?

781
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:07,988
A couple of weeks ago
I did a thing with hostages.

782
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:09,942
- The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

783
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,618
I thought it was like late '80s.

784
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:15,741
That's interesting.

785
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:18,825
Let's just say I'm not
a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

786
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:23,500
Well, he's the reason I became a writer,
but that's not important.

787
00:53:36,377 --> 00:53:39,923
Harry, you and Marie
are both from New Jersey.

788
00:53:40,047 --> 00:53:41,553
- Really?
- Where?

789
00:53:41,673 --> 00:53:43,309
- South Orange.
- Haddonfield.

790
00:53:51,306 --> 00:53:55,445
- So, what are we gonna order?
- I'm gonna start with the grilled radicchio.

791
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,986
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.
Not only does she pick the best,

792
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:02,696
but she orders it in a way even the chef
didn't know how good it could be.

793
00:54:02,815 --> 00:54:05,993
- Restaurants have become too important.
- I agree.

794
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:10,414
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theatre was to people in the '60s."

795
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:12,948
I read that in a magazine.

796
00:54:13,073 --> 00:54:15,160
I wrote that.

797
00:54:15,283 --> 00:54:17,963
- Get outta here.
- No, I did! I wrote that.

798
00:54:18,202 --> 00:54:21,499
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine. That's amazing.

799
00:54:21,621 --> 00:54:25,167
Don't you think that's amazing?
And you wrote it?

800
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,794
I also wrote
"Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."

801
00:54:27,918 --> 00:54:30,681
- Get over yourself!
- I did!

802
00:54:30,962 --> 00:54:33,429
- Where did I read that?
- New York Magazine.

803
00:54:33,548 --> 00:54:35,932
Sally writes for New York Magazine.

804
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,355
You know, that piece had a real impact
on me. I don't know much about writing...

805
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,688
It spoke to you, and that pleases me.

806
00:54:42,805 --> 00:54:46,434
I mean, you have to admire people
who can be that articulate.

807
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:50,187
Nobody has ever quoted
me back to me before.

808
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:03,373
I've been looking for a red suede pump.

809
00:55:05,406 --> 00:55:07,909
What do you think of Jess?

810
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:12,247
- Well...
- Do you think you could go out with him?

811
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:16,921
- I don't know...
- Cos I feel really comfortable with him.

812
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:20,302
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

813
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:23,430
Sure. Sure. I'm just worried about Harry.

814
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:28,634
He's sensitive, he's going through a rough
period, and I don't want you to reject him.

815
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,058
I wouldn't. I totally understand.

816
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:34,688
If you don't think you're gonna call Marie,
do you mind if I call her?

817
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:36,441
- No, no.
- Good. Good.

818
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,778
But for tonight you shouldn't.
I mean, Sally's very vulnerable right now.

819
00:55:40,893 --> 00:55:44,902
You can call Marie, but wait a week or so.
Don't make any moves tonight.

820
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:48,650
Fine. No problem.
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

821
00:55:49,275 --> 00:55:52,951
Well, I don't feel like walking any more.
I think I'll get a cab.

822
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:56,165
- I'll go with you.
- Great! Taxi!

823
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:13,422
A man came to me and said
"I found nice girl for you."

824
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:17,719
"She lives in the next village

825
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,136
and she is ready for marriage."

826
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:26,606
We were not supposed to meet
until the wedding,

827
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:28,808
but I wanted to make sure.

828
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:33,271
So I sneak into her village,
hid behind a tree,

829
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:36,156
watch her washing the clothes.

830
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:42,737
I think if I don't like the way she looks,
I don't marry her.

831
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:45,706
But she looked very nice to me.

832
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,916
So I said "OK" to the man.

833
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,494
We get married.

834
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,628
We married for 55 years.

835
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:00,590
FOUR MONTHS LATER

836
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:05,088
- I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

837
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:09,089
- We'll find something. Great stuff.
- Should have gone to the plant store.

838
00:57:09,213 --> 00:57:12,474
- Here. Perfect for them.
- What's that?

839
00:57:12,591 --> 00:57:15,224
Battery-operated pith helmet, with fan.

840
00:57:15,593 --> 00:57:18,309
- Why is this necessary in life?
- I don't know.

841
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:21,393
Look at this. Also makes great fries.

842
00:57:22,557 --> 00:57:25,569
Good. Call off the dogs. The hunt is over.

843
00:57:25,685 --> 00:57:28,614
Sally, this is the greatest.

844
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:31,029
Sally, please report to me.

845
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,946
Look. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

846
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:39,368
This is a singing machine. Look, you sing
the lead and this has the backup.

847
00:57:39,487 --> 00:57:42,618
- This is from Oklahoma!
- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top".

848
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:45,159
Yes, perfect.

849
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:50,089
~ Chicks and ducks and geese
better scurry

850
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:53,133
~ When I take you out in my surrey

851
00:57:53,248 --> 00:57:57,470
~ When I take you out in my surrey
with the fringe on top

852
00:57:57,585 --> 00:57:58,795
Now you!

853
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:01,422
~ Watch that fringe and see how it flutters

854
00:58:01,547 --> 00:58:04,310
~ When I drive those
high-steppin' strutters

855
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:06,428
~ Nosey pokes'll
peek through the shutters

856
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:09,136
~ And their eyes will pop!

857
00:58:09,261 --> 00:58:12,392
~ The wheels are yellow,
the upholstery's brown

858
00:58:12,514 --> 00:58:14,732
~ The dashboard's genuine leather

859
00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:17,529
~ With isinglass curtains that will ro...

860
00:58:17,976 --> 00:58:19,731
What?

861
00:58:19,853 --> 00:58:22,949
It's my voice, isn't it? You hate my voice.

862
00:58:23,064 --> 00:58:26,575
- I know, it's terrible. Joe hated it...
- It's Helen.

863
00:58:26,692 --> 00:58:28,661
Helen?

864
00:58:28,777 --> 00:58:31,244
She's coming right towards me.

865
00:58:38,993 --> 00:58:42,504
- How are you, Harry?
- Fine. I'm fine.

866
00:58:44,331 --> 00:58:47,094
This is Ira Stone. Harry Burns.

867
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:49,046
Harry.

868
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,559
I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright.
Helen Hillson

869
00:58:56,674 --> 00:58:58,512
and Ira.

870
00:58:58,759 --> 00:59:00,597
Sally.

871
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:03,850
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

872
00:59:06,098 --> 00:59:07,983
Well...

873
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:12,105
- See you.
- Yeah. Bye.

874
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:15,904
Nice to meet you, Ira.

875
00:59:21,068 --> 00:59:23,119
You OK?

876
00:59:24,362 --> 00:59:26,865
Yeah, I'm perfect.

877
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,370
She looked weird, didn't she?
She looked really weird.

878
00:59:30,492 --> 00:59:34,252
- I've never seen her before.
- Trust me. Her legs looked heavy.

879
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,208
- Must be retaining water.
- Harry!

880
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:39,046
Believe me, the woman saved everything.

881
00:59:42,168 --> 00:59:44,255
Sure you're OK?

882
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:47,307
I'm fine.
Look, it had to happen at some point.

883
00:59:47,423 --> 00:59:51,598
In a city of eight million, you're bound
to run into your ex-wife. So it happened.

884
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:53,769
And now I'm fine.

885
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:59,568
I like it. It works. It says "home" to me.

886
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:03,524
All right. All right.
We'll let Harry and Sally be the judge.

887
01:00:04,144 --> 01:00:06,647
What do you think?

888
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:08,692
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

889
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:11,282
Of course he likes it - he's a guy.

890
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,451
Sally?

891
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,493
What's so awful about it?

892
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:20,703
It's so awful, there's no way to begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

893
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:23,124
Honey, I don't object to your things.

894
01:00:23,243 --> 01:00:26,872
If we had room, you could put
your things in it, like your bar stools...

895
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:30,922
Honey, wait, wait. Honey, wait.
You don't like my bar stools?

896
01:00:31,749 --> 01:00:34,429
Harry, come on,
someone has to be on my side.

897
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:37,390
I'm on your side.
I just want you to have good taste.

898
01:00:37,504 --> 01:00:39,757
I have good taste!

899
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:44,933
Everybody thinks they have good taste,
but they couldn't all have good taste.

900
01:00:45,052 --> 01:00:48,894
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

901
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:53,484
We hung things, we picked out tiles
together. Then you know what happens?

902
01:00:53,725 --> 01:00:59,110
Six years later you're singing "Surrey
with the Fringe on Top" in front of lra!

903
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,117
- Do we have to talk about this right now?
- Yes. Right now is the perfect time,

904
01:01:04,234 --> 01:01:08,290
because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

905
01:01:08,404 --> 01:01:12,958
Right now everything is great. Everyone
is happy and in love, and that's wonderful.

906
01:01:13,074 --> 01:01:18,459
But sooner or later, you'll be screaming
at each other about who'll get this dish.

907
01:01:18,578 --> 01:01:23,666
This $8 dish will cost $1 ,000 in calls to the
legal firm of "That's mine, this is yours".

908
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:25,760
- Harry!
- Please.

909
01:01:25,876 --> 01:01:29,090
Jess, Marie,
do me a favour for your own good.

910
01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:33,517
Put your name in your books right now
before you don't know whose is whose,

911
01:01:33,632 --> 01:01:38,768
because some day you'll go 1 5 rounds
over who's gonna get this coffee table.

912
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:44,480
This stupid, wagon-wheel,
Roy-Rogers, garage-sale coffee table!

913
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:49,979
- I thought you liked it.
- I was being nice!

914
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:56,402
He just bumped into Helen.

915
01:02:04,073 --> 01:02:06,872
I want you to know

916
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:11,131
that I will never want
that wagon-wheel coffee table.

917
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:23,014
I know, I know, I shouldn't have done it.

918
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:27,885
Harry, you have to try to find a way of
not expressing every feeling you have,

919
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:30,060
every moment that you have them.

920
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:32,726
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

921
01:02:32,846 --> 01:02:35,526
There are times and places for things.

922
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:41,478
Well, the next time you're giving a lecture
on social graces, tell me cos I'll sign up.

923
01:02:41,603 --> 01:02:45,232
Hey! You don't have
to take your anger out on me.

924
01:02:45,356 --> 01:02:47,443
I'm entitled to throw anger your way.

925
01:02:47,566 --> 01:02:51,705
Especially when I'm being told how
to live my life by Miss Hospital Corners!

926
01:02:51,819 --> 01:02:55,365
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing bothers you!

927
01:02:55,489 --> 01:02:59,201
- You never get upset about anything!
- Don't be ridiculous!

928
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:00,748
What?

929
01:03:00,868 --> 01:03:05,208
You never get upset about Joe. I never
see it back up on you. How is it possible?

930
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:09,635
- Don't you experience feelings of loss?
- I don't have to take this crap.

931
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:13,343
- If you're over Joe, why not see people?
- I see people!

932
01:03:13,462 --> 01:03:16,925
See people! Have you slept
with one person since Joe?

933
01:03:17,048 --> 01:03:19,847
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

934
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:23,893
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?!

935
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:27,973
You have to move back to New Jersey cos
you've slept with everyone in New York.

936
01:03:28,098 --> 01:03:31,609
I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

937
01:03:31,726 --> 01:03:34,774
Besides, I will make love
when it is making love.

938
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:39,283
Not the way you do it,
like you're out for revenge or something.

939
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:42,162
Are you finished now?

940
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,782
Yes.

941
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,287
Can I say something?

942
01:03:46,404 --> 01:03:48,040
Yes.

943
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

944
01:04:04,377 --> 01:04:06,677
Don't say a word!

945
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,471
It's a monkey, a monkey.
Monkey see, monkey do.

946
01:04:13,593 --> 01:04:17,056
- It's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

947
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:20,524
- Planet ofthe Apes!
- She said baby! Try Planet ofthe Dopes.

948
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,482
- It doesn't look like a baby.
- Big mouth. Jagger as a baby.

949
01:04:24,602 --> 01:04:27,187
- Baby ape!
- Stop with the apes.

950
01:04:27,312 --> 01:04:30,526
- Baby's breath.
- Rosemary's Baby's mouth?

951
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:33,151
- "Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?"
- Kiss the baby!

952
01:04:33,275 --> 01:04:37,829
- "Melancholy Baby's Mouth"!
- Baby fish... Baby-fish mouth!

953
01:04:38,738 --> 01:04:40,659
- 1 5 seconds.
- A big mouth.

954
01:04:40,781 --> 01:04:42,785
- Baby boom!
- Baby...

955
01:04:42,908 --> 01:04:45,541
Draw something resembling anything!

956
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,253
- Crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up... Exorcist Baby!

957
01:04:49,496 --> 01:04:53,291
- "Yes Sir, That's My Baby".
- "No sir, don't mean maybe."

958
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:56,215
- That's it. Time's up.
- Baby talk.

959
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:59,715
Baby talk? What's that?
That's not a saying.

960
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:03,847
But "baby-fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation! I hear them talking!

961
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,469
Final score. Our team: 1 10.

962
01:05:06,593 --> 01:05:08,644
You guys: 60.

963
01:05:08,762 --> 01:05:11,893
- Ouch. Fix! Definitely a fix.
- Pathetic.

964
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:17,359
- I can't draw.
- That's a baby, and it's clearly talking.

965
01:05:17,477 --> 01:05:19,315
You're wonderful.

966
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:22,319
- Who wants coffee?
- I do, and I love you.

967
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:25,321
- D'you have tea?
- lndustrial strength.

968
01:05:25,442 --> 01:05:28,905
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

969
01:05:29,737 --> 01:05:31,706
- Three.
- Yes, please.

970
01:05:31,822 --> 01:05:35,415
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

971
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:43,840
Never looked like a baby to me.

972
01:05:43,956 --> 01:05:45,462
- Which part?
- All of it.

973
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:48,963
- You were gonna show me a book cover.
- Yeah, it's in the den.

974
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:53,344
Julian, help yourself.
Have some more wine, whatever, OK?

975
01:05:53,464 --> 01:05:55,717
I like saying den. Got a nice ring to it.

976
01:05:56,258 --> 01:05:59,105
Emily's a little young for Harry,
don't you think?

977
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:02,018
Well, she's young,
but look what she's done.

978
01:06:02,138 --> 01:06:04,522
What has she done? She makes desserts.

979
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:09,028
- Does Julian seem a little stuffy to you?
- He's a good guy. You should talk to him.

980
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:10,566
He's too tall to talk to.

981
01:06:10,686 --> 01:06:13,817
She makes 3,500
chocolate-mousse pies a week.

982
01:06:15,231 --> 01:06:17,484
Emily is "Aunt Emily"?

983
01:06:17,608 --> 01:06:20,075
He took us to a Met game last week.
It was great.

984
01:06:20,194 --> 01:06:24,701
- You all went to a Met game together?
- Yeah, but it was a last-minute thing.

985
01:06:24,822 --> 01:06:26,245
But Sally hates baseball.

986
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:28,618
Harry doesn't even like sweets.

987
01:06:28,742 --> 01:06:31,291
Julian is great.

988
01:06:31,411 --> 01:06:33,415
I know. He's a grown-up.

989
01:06:33,538 --> 01:06:36,965
- Emily is terrific.
- Yeah. But when I asked where she was

990
01:06:37,082 --> 01:06:40,675
when Kennedy was shot,
she said "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

991
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:54,681
- Hello?
- Are you alone?

992
01:06:54,805 --> 01:06:56,892
Yeah. I was just finishing a book.

993
01:06:57,015 --> 01:06:59,897
- Could you come over?
- What's the matter?

994
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:02,989
- He's getting married.
- Who?

995
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,276
Joe!

996
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,868
I'll be right there.

997
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:14,705
- Hi.
- Are you all right?

998
01:07:17,156 --> 01:07:19,409
Come on in.

999
01:07:22,118 --> 01:07:25,214
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

1000
01:07:26,705 --> 01:07:28,840
- I need a Kleenex!
- OK.

1001
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,463
OK. OK.

1002
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,847
He just called me up,
"Wanted to see how you were",

1003
01:07:33,961 --> 01:07:36,380
"Fine. How are you?" "Fine."

1004
01:07:36,504 --> 01:07:40,133
His secretary's on vacation,
everything's all backed up.

1005
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:44,017
He's got a big case in Newark,
blah, blah, blah.

1006
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:49,441
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking
"I am over him, I really am over him,

1007
01:07:49,556 --> 01:07:53,647
I can't believe I was ever
remotely interested in any of this."

1008
01:07:54,686 --> 01:07:57,983
And then he said "I have some news."

1009
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:06,156
She works in his office. She's a paralegal.
Her name is Kimberly.

1010
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:10,081
He just met her!

1011
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:15,713
She's supposed to be his
transitional person, not "the one"!

1012
01:08:21,123 --> 01:08:25,878
All this time, I've been saying
that he didn't wanna get married.

1013
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,590
But the truth is,

1014
01:08:29,713 --> 01:08:32,393
he didn't wanna marry me.

1015
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,763
He didn't love me.

1016
01:08:41,806 --> 01:08:44,486
If you could take him back
right now, would you?

1017
01:08:46,352 --> 01:08:48,403
No!

1018
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,367
But why didn't he wanna marry me?

1019
01:08:52,148 --> 01:08:54,995
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

1020
01:08:55,109 --> 01:08:57,445
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

1021
01:08:57,569 --> 01:09:01,115
- I'm too structured. I'm closed off.
- But in a good way.

1022
01:09:02,156 --> 01:09:05,536
No, no, no. I drove him away.

1023
01:09:07,785 --> 01:09:10,038
And I'm gonna be 40!

1024
01:09:11,163 --> 01:09:12,716
When?

1025
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,167
- Some day.
- ln eight years.

1026
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:20,838
But it's there! It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

1027
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:27,395
And it's not the same for men. Charlie
Chaplin had babies when he was 73.

1028
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:29,727
Yeah, but he was too old to pick 'em up.

1029
01:09:36,058 --> 01:09:38,276
Come here. Come here.

1030
01:09:38,393 --> 01:09:40,278
It's gonna be OK.

1031
01:09:40,395 --> 01:09:42,731
It's gonna be fine, you'll see.

1032
01:09:43,856 --> 01:09:46,987
Go ahead. It's not one
of my favourites anyway.

1033
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,327
It's gonna be OK. Hm?

1034
01:09:57,283 --> 01:09:59,453
Hm? OK?

1035
01:09:59,577 --> 01:10:01,415
OK.

1036
01:10:04,372 --> 01:10:08,214
- I'll make some tea.
- Harry, could you hold me a little longer?

1037
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:10,219
Oh, sure.

1038
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,676
OK? Hm?

1039
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:52,580
Are you comfortable?

1040
01:10:52,702 --> 01:10:54,540
Sure.

1041
01:10:59,374 --> 01:11:03,383
- D'you want something to drink?
- No, I'm OK.

1042
01:11:04,587 --> 01:11:08,347
I'm going to get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

1043
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:10,516
OK. Water.

1044
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:10,682
You have all your video tapes
alphabetised and on index cards.

1045
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:12,229
Thank you.

1046
01:12:12,516 --> 01:12:16,027
- D'you wanna watch something?
- No. Not unless you do.

1047
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:18,696
No. That's OK.

1048
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:36,286
- D'you wanna go to sleep?
- OK.

1049
01:13:10,604 --> 01:13:12,988
Where are you going?

1050
01:13:13,106 --> 01:13:15,573
I gotta go.

1051
01:13:16,734 --> 01:13:19,995
Gotta go home, change my clothes
and go to work. And so do you.

1052
01:13:20,111 --> 01:13:23,906
But after work I'd like to take you
out to dinner, if you're free. You free?

1053
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:26,580
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

1054
01:13:27,242 --> 01:13:29,495
- Fine.
- Fine.

1055
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:50,685
- Yours!
- Hello.

1056
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:53,103
- Sorry to call so early.
- Are you all right?

1057
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:56,648
No one I know would call at this hour.

1058
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,817
- No one I know would call.
- It's awful.

1059
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,772
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

1060
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,898
- Harry came over.
- I went to Sally's.

1061
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:05,784
- I was upset Joe was marrying.
- One thing led to another.

1062
01:14:05,898 --> 01:14:09,195
- Before I knew it we were kissing. Then...
- ..we did it.

1063
01:14:09,317 --> 01:14:10,527
They did it!

1064
01:14:10,652 --> 01:14:12,703
- That's great!
- We prayed for it.

1065
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,536
- You shoulda done it before.
- We said you should do it.

1066
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:18,289
- You belong together.
- You killed two birds with one stone.

1067
01:14:18,408 --> 01:14:21,041
- Two wrongs make a right.
- How was it?

1068
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,713
- During part was good,...
- Good,...

1069
01:14:22,828 --> 01:14:24,879
- ..then I felt suffocated.
- ..then it wasn't.

1070
01:14:24,996 --> 01:14:26,253
- Sorry.
- The worst.

1071
01:14:26,373 --> 01:14:27,760
- I had to go.
- He left.

1072
01:14:27,874 --> 01:14:29,594
- I feel bad.
- I'm embarrassed.

1073
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:30,965
I don't blame you.

1074
01:14:31,085 --> 01:14:33,089
- I feel ill.
- I'm catching a cold.

1075
01:14:33,211 --> 01:14:34,883
Look, it didn't work out.

1076
01:14:35,004 --> 01:14:38,515
Never sleep with anyone
when you find out your ex is marrying.

1077
01:14:38,632 --> 01:14:40,517
- Who's talking?
- Is that Jess?

1078
01:14:40,634 --> 01:14:43,183
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.
- It's Bryant Gumbel.

1079
01:14:43,303 --> 01:14:44,892
Wanna have breakfast?

1080
01:14:45,012 --> 01:14:47,099
- No, I'm not up to it.
- I feel too awful.

1081
01:14:47,222 --> 01:14:49,143
- Good.
- I mean, it's so early.

1082
01:14:49,266 --> 01:14:51,733
- But call me later.
- I'll call you later.

1083
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:53,108
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

1084
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:55,278
- Bye.
- Bye.

1085
01:14:56,522 --> 01:14:59,202
- God!
- I know.

1086
01:15:00,275 --> 01:15:03,371
Tell me I'll never have to be
out there again.

1087
01:15:06,655 --> 01:15:09,537
You will never have to be out there again.

1088
01:15:12,868 --> 01:15:15,252
I'll just say we made a mistake.

1089
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,878
Sally, it was a mistake.

1090
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,753
I just hope I get to say it first.

1091
01:15:24,627 --> 01:15:27,260
I hope she says it before I do.

1092
01:15:30,215 --> 01:15:34,010
- It was a mistake.
- I am so relieved that you think so, too.

1093
01:15:35,678 --> 01:15:38,560
I'm not saying last night wasn't great.

1094
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,644
- It was!
- Yes, it was!

1095
01:15:42,683 --> 01:15:46,194
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

1096
01:15:46,561 --> 01:15:49,775
- I am so relieved!
- Great.

1097
01:15:49,897 --> 01:15:51,948
Yeah.

1098
01:15:54,192 --> 01:15:56,243
Two mixed green salads.

1099
01:16:25,634 --> 01:16:30,686
It is so nice when you can sit
with someone and not have to talk. Hm?

1100
01:16:34,641 --> 01:16:37,144
Most of the time,
you go to bed with someone,

1101
01:16:37,268 --> 01:16:41,359
then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her all your stories.

1102
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:45,275
But with Sally and me,
we'd already heard each other's stories.

1103
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,456
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do. You know?

1104
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:51,788
Sure, Harry.

1105
01:16:52,447 --> 01:16:54,167
I don't know.

1106
01:16:54,282 --> 01:16:59,880
Maybe you get to a point in a relationship
where it's too late to have sex. You know?

1107
01:17:09,461 --> 01:17:11,880
Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?

1108
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:14,055
I don't think so.

1109
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:20,975
- Is he seeing anyone?
- He was seeing this anthropologist, but...

1110
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:26,145
- What does she look like?
- Thin, pretty, big tits.

1111
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:28,815
Your basic nightmare.

1112
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:34,732
What d'ya think?

1113
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:37,992
Marie...

1114
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:40,572
Tell the truth.

1115
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:44,537
It's just beautiful.

1116
01:18:16,139 --> 01:18:21,904
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Marie and Jess.

1117
01:18:22,686 --> 01:18:25,900
And to consecrate
their vows of matrimony.

1118
01:18:26,022 --> 01:18:29,533
The vows they will take join their lives.

1119
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:34,786
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

1120
01:18:34,904 --> 01:18:37,240
And by the rings they will wear,

1121
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:42,286
they will be known to all
as husband and wife.

1122
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:56,386
I've never seen her so happy.
She's a different person.

1123
01:18:56,504 --> 01:19:01,259
Oh, yeah, she is. It's great,
but what're we gonna do about you?

1124
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:03,802
- Me?
- Hon, you wanna dance?

1125
01:19:03,927 --> 01:19:06,394
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, I do.
- Excuse us.

1126
01:19:09,848 --> 01:19:12,528
- Hi.
- Hello.

1127
01:19:16,187 --> 01:19:19,283
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

1128
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:27,154
Boy, the holidays are rough! Every year I
try to get from Thanksgiving to New Year.

1129
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:29,663
A lot of suicides.

1130
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,871
- Would you like a pea pod with shrimp?
- Thank you.

1131
01:19:35,118 --> 01:19:37,881
- How've you been?
- Fine.

1132
01:19:37,996 --> 01:19:39,668
- Seeing anybody?
- Harry.

1133
01:19:39,789 --> 01:19:41,793
- What?
- I don't wanna talk about this.

1134
01:19:41,915 --> 01:19:45,508
- Why not?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1135
01:19:45,627 --> 01:19:49,932
Why can't we get past this? Are we
gonna carry this thing around for ever?

1136
01:19:50,047 --> 01:19:54,471
- Forever? It just happened!
- It happened three weeks ago.

1137
01:19:54,592 --> 01:19:58,553
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

1138
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:00,434
Yes!

1139
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,604
Is one of us supposed to be a dog
in this scenario?

1140
01:20:05,976 --> 01:20:08,360
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

1141
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,734
- You are.
- I am! I am the dog!

1142
01:20:11,856 --> 01:20:14,323
I am the dog! I...

1143
01:20:20,363 --> 01:20:25,534
I don't see that. You are the dog. You act
like what happened didn't mean anything.

1144
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:28,755
No, I don't, but why
does it have to mean everything?

1145
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:34,302
Because it does! You know it better than
anyone, cos after it happens you walk out!

1146
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:37,428
- I didn't walk out.
- Sprinted is more like it.

1147
01:20:37,543 --> 01:20:40,923
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made!

1148
01:20:42,797 --> 01:20:44,718
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

1149
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:50,771
Fine! But let's just get one thing straight. I
did not go over there to make love to you.

1150
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:54,943
But you looked at me with these weepy
eyes: "Don't go home. Hold me, Harry."

1151
01:20:55,057 --> 01:20:58,936
- What was I supposed to do?
- Are you saying you took pity on me?

1152
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,740
- No! I was...
- Fuck you!

1153
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:08,410
Everybody, could I have
your attention, please?

1154
01:21:08,526 --> 01:21:12,784
I'd like to propose a toast,
to Harry and Sally.

1155
01:21:12,905 --> 01:21:14,790
To Harry and Sally.

1156
01:21:14,906 --> 01:21:19,377
If Marie or I had found either of them
remotely attractive,

1157
01:21:19,493 --> 01:21:22,624
we would not be here today.

1158
01:21:31,544 --> 01:21:36,134
~ Have yourselfa merry little Christmas

1159
01:21:37,132 --> 01:21:40,180
~ Let yourselfbe light

1160
01:21:41,469 --> 01:21:47,518
~ From now on
our troubles will be out ofsight

1161
01:21:51,936 --> 01:21:56,360
~ Have yourself a merry little Christmas

1162
01:21:57,232 --> 01:22:00,825
~ Make the yuletide gay

1163
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:07,582
~ From now on
our troubles will be miles away

1164
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:11,661
Hi, it's me. It's the holiday season,

1165
01:22:11,785 --> 01:22:15,331
and I thought I'd remind you
that it's the season of forgiveness.

1166
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:20,129
And, although it's not widely known,
it is also the season of grovelling.

1167
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:22,795
So, if you felt like calling me back,

1168
01:22:23,169 --> 01:22:27,130
I'd be more than happy to do
the traditional Christmas grovelling.

1169
01:22:27,255 --> 01:22:29,093
Give me a call.

1170
01:22:45,145 --> 01:22:48,027
Hi, I'm not home. I'll call you right back.

1171
01:22:48,147 --> 01:22:52,286
If you're there, please pick up.
I really wanna talk to you.

1172
01:22:54,777 --> 01:22:59,450
The fact you're not answering leads me
to believe you're either, A: not at home,

1173
01:22:59,573 --> 01:23:02,870
B: home, but don't wanna talk to me, or C:

1174
01:23:02,992 --> 01:23:07,630
home, desperately wanna talk to me,
but trapped under something heavy.

1175
01:23:07,746 --> 01:23:10,842
If it's either A or C, please call me back.

1176
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:17,383
Obviously she doesn't wanna talk to me.
What do I have to do, be hit on the head?

1177
01:23:17,504 --> 01:23:21,216
If she wants to call, she'll call.
I'm through actin' like a schmuck.

1178
01:23:21,716 --> 01:23:25,061
~ If you're feeling sad and lonely

1179
01:23:25,177 --> 01:23:28,189
~ There's a service I can render

1180
01:23:28,513 --> 01:23:31,360
~ Tell the one who digs you only

1181
01:23:31,473 --> 01:23:34,853
~ I can be so warm and tender

1182
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,446
~ Call me

1183
01:23:36,561 --> 01:23:40,190
~ Maybe it's late tojust call me

1184
01:23:40,314 --> 01:23:43,694
~ Don't be afraid to just phone moi

1185
01:23:43,942 --> 01:23:47,868
~ Call me and I'll be around

1186
01:23:48,237 --> 01:23:49,363
Give me a call.

1187
01:23:49,488 --> 01:23:52,121
- Hi, Harry.
- Hello. Hi! Hi!

1188
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,956
I didn't know that you would...
That you were there.

1189
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:58,006
- What're you doing?
- I was just on my way out.

1190
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,587
Where you going?

1191
01:24:00,705 --> 01:24:03,338
- What do you want, Harry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1192
01:24:03,457 --> 01:24:06,920
I... I just called to say I'm sorry.

1193
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:10,508
OK.

1194
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:21,021
- I gotta go.
- Wait a second. Wait... wait a second.

1195
01:24:21,138 --> 01:24:25,609
What're you doin' for New Year's? Going
to the Tylers' party? I don't have a date.

1196
01:24:25,725 --> 01:24:31,821
If you don't have a date, we always said
we could be together for New Year's and...

1197
01:24:31,938 --> 01:24:35,780
I can't do this any more.
I am not your consolation prize.

1198
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,035
Goodbye.

1199
01:24:46,408 --> 01:24:51,840
And here we are once again. The 16th
annual "New Year's Rockin' Eve",

1200
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:53,674
coming to you live...

1201
01:24:54,081 --> 01:24:57,757
What's so bad about this?
You got Dick Clark - tradition.

1202
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,674
You got Mallomars,
the greatest cookie of all time.

1203
01:25:00,794 --> 01:25:05,514
And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.

1204
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,736
I don't know why I let you drag me to this.

1205
01:25:29,818 --> 01:25:34,491
This is much better. Fresh air,
I have the streets all to myself.

1206
01:25:34,613 --> 01:25:38,373
Who needs to be at a big, crowded party,
pretending to have a good time?

1207
01:25:38,491 --> 01:25:42,286
Plus, this is the perfect time
to catch up on my window-shopping.

1208
01:25:42,619 --> 01:25:44,042
This is good.

1209
01:25:56,005 --> 01:25:59,101
So the guy says "Read the card."

1210
01:26:09,015 --> 01:26:12,111
- I'm going home.
- You'll never get a taxi.

1211
01:26:13,102 --> 01:26:14,312
Oh, God!

1212
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:44,752
You realise that
we could never be friends.

1213
01:26:44,877 --> 01:26:47,213
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

1214
01:26:47,338 --> 01:26:51,014
men and women can't be friends,
cos the sex part always gets in the way.

1215
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:52,602
That's not true!

1216
01:26:52,717 --> 01:26:55,220
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

1217
01:26:55,344 --> 01:26:59,400
- He always wants to have sex with her.
- What if they don't wanna have sex?

1218
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:03,226
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

1219
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:05,935
And that is the end ofthe story.

1220
01:27:06,061 --> 01:27:08,860
- I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

1221
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,616
That's too bad.

1222
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:13,743
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

1223
01:27:17,653 --> 01:27:22,540
~ It had to be you

1224
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:29,880
~ It had to be you

1225
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,964
~ I wandered around

1226
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:41,177
~ And I finally found

1227
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:45,057
~ The somebody who

1228
01:27:48,386 --> 01:27:54,103
~ Could make me be true

1229
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:59,112
~ And could make me be blue...

1230
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:03,575
- I'm going.
- It's almost midnight!

1231
01:28:03,982 --> 01:28:07,694
- The thought of not kissing somebody...
- I'll kiss you.

1232
01:28:08,819 --> 01:28:11,322
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

1233
01:28:11,446 --> 01:28:13,450
Taxi!

1234
01:28:13,573 --> 01:28:15,411
Shit.

1235
01:28:16,283 --> 01:28:20,873
- Come on, stay. Please.
- Thanks, Jess. I just... I have to go.

1236
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:23,759
- Wait two minutes.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

1237
01:28:23,873 --> 01:28:29,044
~ Might never be mean

1238
01:28:31,254 --> 01:28:35,049
~ Might never be cross

1239
01:28:35,174 --> 01:28:38,222
~ Or try to be boss

1240
01:28:39,302 --> 01:28:43,856
~ But they wouldn't do

1241
01:28:46,099 --> 01:28:50,190
~ For nobody else

1242
01:28:50,311 --> 01:28:53,738
~ Gave me a thrill

1243
01:28:54,814 --> 01:28:57,447
~ With all your faults

1244
01:28:57,566 --> 01:29:00,614
~ I love you still

1245
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:03,452
~ It had to be you...

1246
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:07,497
I've been doin' a lot of thinkin',
and the thing is, I love you.

1247
01:29:07,616 --> 01:29:10,379
- What?
- I love you.

1248
01:29:10,743 --> 01:29:15,083
- How d'you expect me to respond to this?
- How about you love me, too?

1249
01:29:15,581 --> 01:29:19,637
- How about I'm leaving?
- Doesn't what I said mean anything?

1250
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:23,712
Sorry, Harry. I know it's New Year's Eve,
I know you're feeling lonely,

1251
01:29:23,837 --> 01:29:29,139
but you just can't show up, say you love
me and expect that to make it all right.

1252
01:29:29,258 --> 01:29:32,769
- It doesn't work this way.
- Well, how does it work?

1253
01:29:32,886 --> 01:29:36,681
- I don't know, but not this way.
- Then how about this way?

1254
01:29:36,806 --> 01:29:39,355
I love that you get cold when it's 71?out.

1255
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:42,274
I love that it takes you 1 1
2 hours

1256
01:29:42,394 --> 01:29:45,774
I love that you get a crinkle here
when you look at me like I'm nuts.

1257
01:29:45,896 --> 01:29:49,738
I love that after I spend a day with you
I smell your perfume on my clothes.

1258
01:29:49,858 --> 01:29:54,496
And I love that you are the last person I
wanna talk to before I go to sleep at night.

1259
01:29:54,612 --> 01:29:58,407
And it's not because I'm lonely
or because it's New Year's Eve.

1260
01:29:58,532 --> 01:30:02,754
I came cos when you realise you wanna
spend the rest of your life with someone

1261
01:30:02,868 --> 01:30:06,295
you want the rest of your life
to start as soon as possible.

1262
01:30:09,624 --> 01:30:11,675
You see?

1263
01:30:12,459 --> 01:30:14,510
That is just like you, Harry.

1264
01:30:14,628 --> 01:30:19,218
You say things like that and you make it
impossible for me to hate you!

1265
01:30:20,132 --> 01:30:23,096
And I hate you, Harry.

1266
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:26,352
I really hate you.

1267
01:30:30,098 --> 01:30:32,149
I hate you.

1268
01:30:49,447 --> 01:30:52,708
What does this song mean?
My whole life, I don't know.

1269
01:30:52,825 --> 01:30:56,418
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot" -
should we forget old acquaintances?

1270
01:30:56,536 --> 01:30:58,872
Or if we forget them,
should we remember them?

1271
01:30:58,996 --> 01:31:01,795
Which is not possible
cos we already forgot 'em!

1272
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:06,635
Maybe it just means we should remember
that we forgot them, or something.

1273
01:31:09,088 --> 01:31:12,100
Anyway, it's about old friends.

1274
01:31:18,846 --> 01:31:21,395
The first time we met
we hated each other.

1275
01:31:21,514 --> 01:31:26,353
No, I hated you. The second time we met,
you didn't even remember me.

1276
01:31:26,477 --> 01:31:28,813
I did, too! I remembered you.

1277
01:31:28,937 --> 01:31:31,486
The third time we met
we became friends.

1278
01:31:31,606 --> 01:31:35,033
- We were friends for a long time.
- And then we weren't.

1279
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:37,534
And then we fell in love.

1280
01:31:37,944 --> 01:31:41,537
- Three months later we got married.
- It only took three months.

1281
01:31:41,655 --> 01:31:43,493
12 years and three months.

1282
01:31:43,615 --> 01:31:48,169
- We had a really wonderful wedding.
- It really was a beautiful wedding.

1283
01:31:48,286 --> 01:31:52,544
- We had this enormous coconut cake.
- Huge coconut cake with the tiers.

1284
01:31:52,664 --> 01:31:55,712
And there was this very rich
chocolate sauce on the side.

1285
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:59,296
Right. Cos not everybody likes it
on the cake cos it makes it soggy.

1286
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:04,140
Particularly, the coconut soaks up a lot,
so it's important to keep it on the side.

1287
01:32:04,549 --> 01:32:06,684
~ It had to be you

1288
01:32:07,134 --> 01:32:09,767
~ It had to be you

1289
01:32:09,886 --> 01:32:12,602
~ I wandered around and finally found

1290
01:32:12,722 --> 01:32:14,940
~ The somebody who

1291
01:32:15,057 --> 01:32:17,560
~ Could make me be true

1292
01:32:17,684 --> 01:32:20,317
~ Could make me be blue

1293
01:32:20,436 --> 01:32:23,152
~ And even be gladjust to be sad

1294
01:32:23,272 --> 01:32:25,775
~ Thinking of you

1295
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:29,199
~ But you say ee-ther, and I say either

1296
01:32:29,318 --> 01:32:31,737
~ You say nee-ther, I say neither

1297
01:32:31,862 --> 01:32:34,329
~ Ee-ther, either Nee-ther, neither

1298
01:32:34,447 --> 01:32:37,163
~ Let's call the whole thing off

1299
01:32:37,283 --> 01:32:39,702
~ You say potato and I say pot-ahto

1300
01:32:39,827 --> 01:32:42,376
~ You say tomato, I say tom-ahto

1301
01:32:42,495 --> 01:32:44,998
~ Potato, pot-ahto Tomato, tom-ahto

1302
01:32:45,123 --> 01:32:47,672
~ Let's call the whole thing off

1303
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:52,678
~ Oh, if we call the whole thing off,
then we must part

1304
01:32:52,795 --> 01:32:58,310
~ And though if we ever part,
that would break my heart

1305
01:32:58,425 --> 01:33:00,809
~ You say laughter, I say larf-ter

1306
01:33:00,927 --> 01:33:03,263
~ You say after, I say arf-ter

1307
01:33:03,387 --> 01:33:05,438
~ Before we know we need each other

1308
01:33:05,556 --> 01:33:08,687
~ So we'd better call, call it off, oh!

1309
01:33:08,808 --> 01:33:10,729
~ Let's
~ Call it off!

1310
01:33:10,851 --> 01:33:13,354
~ Oh, let's
~ Call it off!

1311
01:33:13,478 --> 01:33:15,897
~ Baby, let's
~ Call it off!

1312
01:33:16,022 --> 01:33:19,319
~ Sugar, why don't we

1313
01:33:19,442 --> 01:33:22,739
~ Let's, let's call the whole thing

1314
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:10,232
~ They're writing songs oflove,
but not for me

1315
01:34:10,357 --> 01:34:15,196
~ A lucky star's above, but not for me

1316
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:20,537
~ With love to lead the way,
I've found more clouds ofgrey

1317
01:34:20,657 --> 01:34:25,875
~ Than any Russian play could guarantee

1318
01:34:25,995 --> 01:34:31,047
~ I was a fool to fall and get that way

1319
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:33,050
~ Hi-ho alas

1320
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:36,428
~ And also lackaday

1321
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:42,012
~ Although I can't dismiss
the memory ofher kiss

1322
01:34:42,132 --> 01:34:45,346
~ I guess she's not for me

1323
01:34:45,468 --> 01:34:48,017
~ It had to be you

1324
01:34:48,137 --> 01:34:51,564
~ It had to be you

1325
01:34:52,516 --> 01:34:54,651
~ For nobody else gave me a thrill

1326
01:34:55,018 --> 01:34:57,900
~ With all your faults, I love you still

1327
01:35:02,941 --> 01:35:05,788
~ It had to be you, wonderful you

1328
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:08,368
~ It had to be you
