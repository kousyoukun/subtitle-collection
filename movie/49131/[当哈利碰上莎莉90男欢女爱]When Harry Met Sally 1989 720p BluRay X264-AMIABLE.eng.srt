00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,323
I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

2
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,523
It was a Horn & Hardart cafeteria.

3
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,009
And this beautiful girl walked in,
and I turned to Arthur

4
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,001
and I said "Arthur, you see that girl?
I'm going to marry her."

5
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,646
And two weeks later we were married.

6
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,969
And it's over 50 years later,

7
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,242
and we're still married.

8
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,563
~ It's very clear

9
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,444
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - 1977

10
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,723
~ Our love is here to stay

11
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,008
- I love you.
- I love you.

12
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,841
~ Not for a year

13
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,760
~ But ever and a day

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,530
~ Oh, the radio and the telephone

15
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,042
~ And the movies that we know

16
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,846
~ May just be passing fancies...

17
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,090
Hi, Sally. Sally, this is Harry Burns.

18
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,443
- Harry, this is Sally Albright.
- Nice to meet you.

19
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,882
- Wanna drive the first shift?
- You're there already. You start.

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,162
Back's open.

21
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,611
- Call me.
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.

22
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,645
- Call me from the road.
- I'll call you before that.

23
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,764
- I love you.
- I love you.

24
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,809
Sorry.

25
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,605
- I miss you already. I miss you already.
- I miss you.

26
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,881
- Bye.
- Bye.

27
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,607
~ In time, the Rockies may crumble

28
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,371
~ Gibraltar may tumble

29
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,528
~ They only made of clay

30
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,848
~ But

31
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,046
~ Our love is here to stay

32
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,921
I have it all figured out. It's an 18-hour trip,
which becomes six shifts of three hours.

33
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,567
Or, alternatively,
we could break it down by mileage.

34
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,241
There's a... There's a map on the visor

35
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,126
that I've marked to show the locations
where we can change shifts.

36
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,049
Grape?

37
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,561
No. I don't like to eat between meals.

38
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,161
I'll roll down the window.

39
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,371
Why don't you tell me
the story of your life?

40
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,330
- The story of my life?
- We got 18 hours to kill before New York.

41
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,161
That won't even get us out of Chicago.
Nothing's happened to me yet.

42
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,726
- So I'm going to New York.
- So something'll happen?

43
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,205
- Yes.
- Like what?

44
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,721
Like I'm going to journalism school.

45
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,606
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

46
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,564
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens.

47
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,287
Suppose you never meet anybody,
you never become anything,

48
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,804
then you die and nobody notices for two
weeks until the smell drifts into the hall.

49
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,289
- Amanda said you had a dark side.
- That's what drew her to me.

50
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,609
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?

51
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,287
I know, you probably
dot your "i"s with little hearts.

52
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,971
I have just as much of a
dark side as the next person.

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,482
Oh, really? When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

54
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,285
That way, if I die before I finish
I know how it ends.

55
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,721
That, my friend, is a dark side.

56
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,243
That doesn't mean you're deep.
I mean, yes, basically I'm a happy person.

57
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
- So am I.
- I don't see anything wrong with that.

58
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,043
No, you're too busy being happy.
Ever think about death?

59
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,288
- Yes.
- Sure you do. A fleeting thought

60
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,688
that drifts in and out of the transom
of your mind. I spend days.

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,768
And this makes you a better person?

62
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,521
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared and you're not.

63
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,725
In the meantime, you're gonna
ruin your whole life waiting for it.

64
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,643
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong. He wants her to leave.

65
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,809
- That's why he puts her on the plane.
- She doesn't want to stay!

66
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,005
Of course she wants to stay! Wouldn't you
rather be with Bogart than the other guy?

67
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,081
I don't wanna spend my life in Casablanca
married to a man who runs a bar.

68
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,567
That probably sounds snobbish
to you, but I don't.

69
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,968
- You'd rather be in a loveless marriage...
- And First Lady of Czechoslovakia.

70
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,004
..than with the man you had
the greatest sex of your life with,

71
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,771
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

72
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,245
Yes.

73
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,682
And so would any woman in
her right mind. Women are practical,

74
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,601
even Ingrid Bergman, which is why she
gets on the plane at the end of the movie.

75
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,402
I understand.

76
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,887
- What? What?
- Nothing.

77
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,289
- What?
- Forget about it.

78
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,767
- Forget about what?
- It's not important.

79
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,848
No, just tell me.

80
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,171
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

81
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,442
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

82
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,608
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

83
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,281
It just so happens that
I have had plenty of good sex.

84
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,081
With whom?

85
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,727
- What?
- With whom did you have this great sex?

86
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,888
I'm not gonna tell you that!

87
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,811
Fine. Don't tell me.

88
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,681
- Shel Gordon.
- Shel. Sheldon?

89
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,009
No. No, you did not have
great sex with Sheldon.

90
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,726
- I did, too.
- No, you didn't.

91
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,129
A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you
need a root canal, Sheldon's your man.

92
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,289
But humpin' is not Sheldon's strong suit.
It's the name.

93
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,883
"Do it to me, Sheldon." "You're an animal,
Sheldon." "Ride me, big Sheldon."

94
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,891
- It doesn't work.
- Hi.

95
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,367
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number three.

96
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,485
The chef's salad with the oil and vinegar
on the side. And the apple pie ?la mode.

97
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,763
Chef and apple ?la mode.

98
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,407
But I'd like the pie heated
and I want the ice cream on the side.

99
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,048
I'd like strawberry, if you have it. If not,
then whipped cream, but only if it's real.

100
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,810
If it's out of a can, nothing.

101
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,686
- Not even the pie?
- No, just the pie, but then not heated.

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,685
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

103
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,043
- How come you broke up with Sheldon?
- How do you know we broke up?

104
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,246
If you didn't, you wouldn't be with me.
You'd be with Shel the Wonder Schlong.

105
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,603
First of all, I am not with you.

106
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,167
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

107
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,682
You're right, you're right.
I don't wanna know.

108
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,643
Well, it was because he was jealous and
I had these days-of-the-week underpants.

109
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,841
Sorry, I need a judge's ruling on this.

110
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,406
- Days-of-the-week underpants?
- Yes.

111
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,683
They had days of the week on them
and I thought they were funny.

112
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,282
Then one day Sheldon says to me
"You never wear Sunday."

113
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,324
He's all suspicious.
Where had I left Sunday?

114
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,522
And I told him and he didn't believe me.

115
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,770
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

116
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,123
- Why not?
- Because of God.

117
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,325
OK, so 15 % of my share is 90.

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,162
$6.90.

119
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,081
Let's leave seven.

120
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,762
What?

121
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,122
Do I have something on my face?

122
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,288
You're a very attractive person.

123
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,521
Thank you.

124
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,768
Amanda never said
how attractive you were.

125
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,451
Maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.

126
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,122
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

127
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,408
Amanda is my friend.

128
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,931
So?

129
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,771
- So you're going with her.
- So?

130
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,962
So you're coming on to me!

131
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,921
No, I wasn't.

132
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,050
What?

133
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,286
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

134
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,765
All right, all right.

135
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,363
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

136
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,326
What d'you want me to do about it?
I take it back, OK? I take it back.

137
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,851
You can't take it back.

138
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,531
- Why not?
- Because it's already out there.

139
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,962
What are we supposed to do?
Call the cops, it's already out there!

140
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,005
Just let it lie.

141
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,682
- OK?
- Great! "Let it lie." That's my policy.

142
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,770
That's what I always say: "Let it lie."

143
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,564
Wanna spend the night in a motel?

144
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,648
- See? I didn't let it lie.
- Harry.

145
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,728
I said I would, then I didn't.

146
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,410
- Harry!
- What?

147
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,841
We are just going to be friends, OK?

148
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,486
Great! Friends! It's the best thing.

149
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,565
You realise
that we could never be friends.

150
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,331
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

151
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,290
and this is not a come-on
in any way, shape or form,

152
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,122
is that men and women can't be friends,
cos the sex part always gets in the way.

153
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,724
That's not true. I have a number of
men friends and there is no sex involved.

154
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,921
- You don't.
- I do.

155
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,201
- You don't.
- I do!

156
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,526
You only think you do.

157
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,802
I have sex with them
without my knowledge?

158
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,129
No, they all wanna have sex with you.

159
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,765
- They do not.
- Do, too.

160
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,803
- They do not.
- Do, too.

161
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,887
How do you know?

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,004
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

163
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,726
He always wants to have sex with her.

164
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,811
So you're saying a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

165
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,845
No, you pretty much
wanna nail them, too.

166
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,442
What if they don't wanna have sex?

167
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,851
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

168
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,371
- I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

169
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,369
That's too bad.

170
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,290
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

171
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,882
~ You say ee-ther, I say either

172
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,641
~ You say nee-ther and I say neither

173
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,444
~ Ee-ther, either

174
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,369
~ And nee-ther, neither

175
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,563
~ Let's call the whole thing off

176
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,969
~ Yes, you like potato and I like pot-ahto

177
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,721
~ You like tomato, I like tom-ahto

178
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,649
~ Potato, pot-ahto

179
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,683
~ Tomato, tom-ahto

180
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,724
~ Let's call the whole thing off

181
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,126
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah. It was interesting.

182
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,210
- It was nice knowing you.
- Yeah.

183
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,526
- Well, have a nice life.
- You, too.

184
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,202
~ You like potato and I like pot-ahto

185
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,120
~ You like tomato, I like tom-ahto

186
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,004
~ Potato, pot-ahto

187
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,088
~ Tomato, tom-ahto

188
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,090
~ Let's call the whole thing off

189
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,326
- We fell in love in high school.
- Yeah, we were high-school sweethearts.

190
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,569
But then after our junior year
his parents moved away.

191
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,651
- But I never forgot her.
- He never forgot me.

192
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,003
No, her face was burned on my brain.

193
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,602
And it was 34 years later
that I was walking down Broadway

194
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,768
and I saw her come out of Toffenetti's.

195
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,689
We both looked at each other,

196
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,010
and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

197
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,966
She was just as beautiful
as she was at sixteen.

198
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,242
He was just the same.

199
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,522
He looked exactly the same.

200
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,369
FIVE YEARS LATER

201
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,445
Joe! I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

202
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,528
- Harry Burns.
- Harry. How ya doin'?

203
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,564
- Good. How you doin'?
- Fine. I'm doin' fine.

204
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,967
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

205
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,605
Yeah, it was.

206
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,645
- You still with the DA's office?
- No, I switched to the other side. You?

207
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,004
I work with a small firm. We do
political consulting. Yeah, it's great.

208
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,603
Harry, this is Sally Albright. Harry Burns.

209
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,684
Harry and I, we used to...
We lived in the same building.

210
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,005
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was good to see you, Joe. Bye.

211
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,206
Thank God he couldn't place me. I drove
to New York with him five years ago

212
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,210
and it was the longest night of my life.

213
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,490
- What happened?
- He made a pass at me. When I said no:

214
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,570
he was going with a girlfriend of mine...

215
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,410
Oh, God. I can't remember her name.

216
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,320
Don't get involved with me. I am 26
and can't remember the name of the girl

217
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,161
I was such good friends with
I wouldn't get involved with her boyfriend.

218
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,248
- So what happened?
- When?

219
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,443
When he made a pass, you said no...

220
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,086
I said we could just be friends.

221
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,411
And this part I remember. He said men
and women could never really be friends.

222
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,648
Do you think that's true?

223
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,641
No.

224
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,451
Do you have any women friends,
just friends?

225
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,565
No.

226
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,604
But I will get one if it's important to you.

227
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,408
Amanda Reese!

228
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,727
That was her name. Thank God.

229
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,322
I will miss you. I love you.

230
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,208
- You do?
- Yes.

231
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,368
I love you.

232
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,366
- What would you like to drink?
- Nothing, thanks.

233
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,403
- D'you have any Bloody Mary mix?
- Yes.

234
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,367
No, wait. Here's what I want. Regular
tomato juice, fill it up three quarters,

235
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,042
then add a splash of Bloody Mary mix -
just a splash - and some lime on the side.

236
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,322
The University of Chicago, right?

237
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,922
- Yes.
- Did you look this good at university?

238
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,361
- No.
- Did we ever...?

239
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,448
No. No!

240
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,091
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

241
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,647
- Would you two like to sit together?
- Great! Thank you.

242
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,767
You were a good friend of...

243
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,842
Amanda's. I can't believe
you can't remember her name.

244
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,361
What do you mean?
I can remember. Amanda Rice.

245
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,051
- Reese.
- Reese, right. What happened to her?

246
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,760
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?!

247
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,407
You were friends. We didn't make it
because you were such good friends.

248
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,329
- You went with her!
- Was it worth it?

249
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,841
The sacrifice, for a friend
you no longer see?

250
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,167
Harry, you might not believe this,

251
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,046
but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

252
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,011
Fair enough. Fair enough.

253
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,162
- You wanted to be a gymnast.
- Journalist.

254
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,841
- That's what I said. And?
- I am a journalist. I work at The News.

255
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,201
Great. And you're with Joe.

256
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,971
Well, that's great. Great.

257
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,845
You're together, what, three weeks?

258
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,729
- A month. How did you know?
- You take someone to the airport,

259
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,370
it's the beginning of a relationship. That
is why I never do that at the beginning.

260
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,086
- Why?
- Because eventually things move on

261
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,329
and you don't take someone.
I never wanted anyone to say

262
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,842
"How come you never take me
to the airport any more?"

263
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,727
It's amazing. You look normal,
but actually you are the Angel of Death.

264
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,922
Are you gonna marry him?

265
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,522
We have known each other a month and
neither of us wants to marry right now.

266
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,324
I'm getting married.

267
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,522
You are?

268
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,802
- You are?
- Yeah.

269
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,485
- Who is she?
- Helen Hillson. She's keeping her name.

270
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,087
- You're getting married.
- Yeah.

271
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,885
What's so funny about that?

272
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,170
It's just... It's just
so optimistic of you, Harry.

273
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,090
You'd be amazed what
falling madly in love can do for you.

274
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,488
Well, it's wonderful.
It's nice to see you embracing life.

275
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,525
Yeah. Plus, you get to a certain point
where you get tired of the whole thing.

276
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,962
- What whole thing?
- The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

277
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,165
You meet someone, you have the safe
lunch, you decide to move on to dinner.

278
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,443
You go dancing,
you do the white man's overbite,

279
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,925
go back to her place, have sex, and then
you know what goes through your mind?

280
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,487
"How long do I have to lie here
and hold her before I can go home?"

281
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,568
"Is 30 seconds enough?"

282
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,411
That's what you're thinking? Is that true?

283
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,841
Sure. All men think that.

284
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,043
How long do you like to be
held afterwards? All night, right?

285
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,445
That's the problem. Somewhere between
30 seconds and all night is your problem.

286
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,927
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

287
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,801
- Staying over?
- Yes.

288
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,402
Would you like to have dinner?
Just friends.

289
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,841
You don't believe
men and women can be friends.

290
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,167
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

291
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,442
No, no, no, no, I never said that.

292
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,681
Yes, that's right. They can't be friends.

293
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,203
Unless both are involved with someone.
Then they can. I amend the earlier rule.

294
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,451
If two people are in relationships, the
pressure of possible involvement is lifted.

295
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,689
That doesn't work either.
The person you're with can't see

296
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,167
why you need to be friends
with the person,

297
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,648
like it means something
is missing from the relationship.

298
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,401
Then when you say "No, nothing
is missing", the person you're with

299
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,320
accuses you of being attracted
to the person you're just friends with,

300
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,091
which you probably are.
I mean, let's face it.

301
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,521
So we're back to the rule
before the amendment:

302
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,291
men and women can't be friends.
Where's it leave us?

303
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,765
- Harry.
- What?

304
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,803
Goodbye.

305
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,684
OK.

306
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,010
I'll just stop walking. I'll let you go ahead.

307
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,928
We were married 40 years ago.

308
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,601
We were married three years,
we got a divorce. Then I married Marjorie.

309
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,166
- First you lived with Barbara.
- Right, Barbara.

310
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,726
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

311
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,923
- Then you got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

312
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,610
Another divorce.

313
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,487
Then a couple of years later at
Eddie Collecio's funeral, I ran into her.

314
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,206
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

315
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,971
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

316
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,401
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

317
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,683
I remember I snuck over to her
and I said...

318
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,804
- What did I say?
- You said "What are you doin' after?"

319
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,323
Right. So I ditch Roberta, we go
for coffee, a month later we're married.

320
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,410
35 years to the day
after our first marriage.

321
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,450
- I went through his pockets.
- Marie, why?

322
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,721
FIVE YEARS LATER

323
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,286
- You know what I found?
- No, what?

324
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,405
They just bought a dining-room table.
His wife just spent $1 ,600 on a table.

325
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,251
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

326
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,408
The point is he's never gonna leave her.

327
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,966
What else is new?
You've known this for two years.

328
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,487
You're right. I know you're right.

329
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,571
Can't you find someone single? When I
was single I knew lots of nice single men.

330
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,251
There must be someone.
Sally found someone.

331
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,567
Sally got the last good one.

332
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,489
- Joe and I broke up.
- What?

333
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,125
- When?
- Monday.

334
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,368
- You waited three days?
- Joe's available?

335
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,530
For God's sake, Marie, don't you
have feelings? She's obviously upset.

336
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,530
I'm not that upset.
We'd been growing apart for a while.

337
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,051
But you were a couple.

338
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,801
You had someone to go places with.
You had a date on national holidays!

339
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,407
I said to myself "You deserve
more than this. You're 31 ..."

340
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,730
- And the clock is ticking.
- No, it doesn't start to tick until you're 36.

341
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,047
God, you're in such great shape.

342
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,165
Well, I've had a few days
to get used to it, and I feel OK.

343
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,408
Good. Then you're ready.

344
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,889
- Really, Marie!
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

345
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,561
I've got the perfect guy.
I don't find him attractive, but you might.

346
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,682
She doesn't have a problem with chins.

347
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,407
- Marie, I'm not ready yet.
- But you just said you were over him.

348
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,842
I am over him,
but I'm in a mourning period.

349
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,641
- Who is it?
- Alex Anderson.

350
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,441
You fixed me up with him six years ago.

351
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,961
Sorry. God.

352
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,481
All right, wait. Here. Here we go.

353
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,047
- Ken Darman.
- He's been married for over a year.

354
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,328
Really?

355
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,408
Married.

356
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,568
- Wait. Wait, I got one.
- Look,

357
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,004
there is no point going out with someone
I might like if I met him at the right time,

358
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,681
but who right now would
just be a transitional man.

359
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,249
OK, but don't wait too long. Remember
what happened with David Warsaw?

360
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,922
His wife left him and everyone said "Give
him some time. Don't move in too fast."

361
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,401
Six months later he was dead.

362
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,082
Are you saying I should marry quickly
in case he's about to die?

363
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,567
At least you could say you were married.

364
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,846
I'm saying that the right man is out there.
If you don't grab him, someone else will,

365
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,444
and you'll spend your life knowing that
someone else is married to your husband.

366
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,682
Ten! Hut!

367
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,320
- When did this happen?
- Friday. Helen comes home from work

368
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,762
and she says "I don't know
if I wanna be married any more."

369
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,171
Like it's the institution. Nothing personal,
just something she's been thinking about.

370
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,729
I'm calm. I say "Why don't we take time to
think about it? Don't rush into anything."

371
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,889
- Yeah, right.
- Next day she says she's thought about it.

372
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,288
She wants a trial separation.
She just wants to try it.

373
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,609
But we can still date -
like this is supposed to cushion the blow.

374
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,725
I got married so I could stop dating,
so still dating is not a big incentive

375
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,367
since the last thing you wanna do
is date your wife, who should love you.

376
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,007
Which is what I'm saying to her,
when it occurs to me maybe she doesn't.

377
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,805
So I say to her
"Don't you love me any more?"

378
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,242
D'you know what she says?
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

379
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,251
That's harsh. You don't
bounce back from that right away.

380
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,250
- Thanks, Jess.
- No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.

381
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,930
That's particularly harsh.

382
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,203
Then she says someone in her office
is going to South America

383
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,769
and she can sublet his apartment.
I can't believe this. And the doorbell rings.

384
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,124
"I can sublet his apartment" - the words
still hang in the air like in a balloon...

385
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,810
- Like a cartoon.
- Right.

386
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,687
So I go to the door and there are moving
men there. Now I start to get suspicious.

387
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,407
I say "Helen, when did you call
these movers?" She doesn't say anything.

388
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,251
So I ask the movers
"When did this woman book you?"

389
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,241
And they're three huge guys. One with
a T-shirt saying "Don't fuck with Mr Zero."

390
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,685
So I said "Helen, when did you make this
arrangement?" She says "A week ago."

391
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,883
I said "You've known for a week
and you didn't tell me?"

392
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,243
And she says
"I didn't wanna ruin your birthday."

393
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,484
Mr Zero knew you were getting
a divorce a week before you?

394
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,489
- Mr Zero knew.
- I can't believe this!

395
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,810
- I haven't told you the bad part yet.
- What's worse than Mr Zero knowing?

396
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,888
It's all a lie.

397
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,445
She's in love with somebody else.
Some tax attorney.

398
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,406
- She moved in with him.
- How did you find out?

399
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,727
I followed her. Stood outside the building.

400
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,525
- That's so humiliating!
- Tell me about it.

401
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,930
And, you know, I knew. I knew that even
though we were happy, it was an illusion.

402
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,441
And that one day
she'd kick the shit outta me.

403
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,691
Marriages don't break up due to infidelity.
It's a symptom something else is wrong.

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,844
Oh, really?
Well, that symptom is fucking my wife!

405
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,249
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

406
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,368
What do you mean
"just happened" to see it?

407
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,281
Well, he was shaving,
and there it was in his briefcase.

408
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,926
What if he came out and saw you?

409
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,805
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

410
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,881
He just spent $1 20
on a new nightgown for his wife.

411
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,603
- I don't think he's ever gonna leave her.
- No one thinks he's ever gonna leave her.

412
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,088
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

413
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,801
Someone is staring at you
in Personal Growth.

414
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,688
I know him. You'd like him. He's married.

415
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,411
- Who is he?
- Harry Burns. He's a political consultant.

416
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,165
He's cute.

417
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,523
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

418
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,722
Last time I saw him
he was getting married.

419
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,810
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

420
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,764
So he might not be married any more.

421
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,769
Also, he's obnoxious.

422
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,965
It's like in The Lady Vanishes, when she
says "You're the most obnoxious man",...

423
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,163
- "The most contemptible".
- ..then they fall madly in love.

424
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,648
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

425
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,488
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

426
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,126
It is. This is Marie.

427
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,284
Was Marie.

428
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,368
- How are you?
- Fine.

429
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,211
- How's Joe?
- Fine.

430
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,368
I hear he's fine.

431
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,768
- You're not with Joe any more?
- We just broke up.

432
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,288
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

433
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,600
Yeah. Well, you know.

434
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,085
Yeah.

435
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,168
So...

436
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,203
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

437
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,288
How's married life?

438
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,044
I'm getting a divorce.

439
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,081
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

440
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,451
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

441
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,130
What happened with you guys?

442
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,280
When Joe and I started seeing each other
we wanted the same thing.

443
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,530
We didn't wanna get married because
every time anyone we knew got married

444
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,565
it ruined their relationship.
They practically never had sex again.

445
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,207
It's true. That's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

446
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,690
I would sit with my girlfriends who have
kids... my one girlfriend with kids, Alice,

447
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,805
and she would complain about
how she and Gary never did it any more.

448
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,208
She didn't even complain about it.
She said it matter-of-factly.

449
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,688
She said they were up all night,
they were both exhausted,

450
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,361
the kids took every sexual impulse
they had out of them.

451
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,522
Joe and I would say "We're so lucky.
We have this wonderful relationship."

452
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,725
"We can have sex on the kitchen floor
and not worry about the kids walking in."

453
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,526
"We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

454
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,683
Then one day I was taking
Alice's girl for the afternoon

455
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,170
cos I promised to take her to the circus.
We were in the cab playing I-spy.

456
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,851
"I spy a mailbox", "I spy a lamppost".

457
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,927
And she looked out the window
and she saw this man and woman

458
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,204
with these two little kids, and the man
had one of the kids on his shoulders.

459
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,483
And she said "I spy a family."

460
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,964
And I started to cry.
You know, I just started crying.

461
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,931
And I went home
and I said "The thing is, Joe,

462
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,044
we never do fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

463
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,924
And the kitchen floor...?

464
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,048
Not once. It's this very cold,
hard, Mexican ceramic tile.

465
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,770
Anyway,

466
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,091
we talked about it for a long time. I said
"This is what I want" and he said "I don't".

467
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,363
And I said "Well, I guess it's over."
And he left.

468
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,926
And the thing is, I... I feel really fine.

469
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,169
I am over him.
I mean, I really am over him.

470
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,363
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

471
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,361
And every time I think about it, I am more
and more convinced I did the right thing.

472
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,767
Boy, you sound really healthy.

473
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,370
Yeah.

474
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,003
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me.

475
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,808
But really, what's so hard about finding an
apartment? You read the obituary column.

476
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,402
You find out who died, go to the building,
and then you tip the doorman.

477
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,491
It'd be easier if they combined
obituaries with the real-estate section.

478
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,729
Then you have "Mr Klein died,
leaving a wife, two children

479
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,528
and a spacious three-bedroom
apartment with a wood-burning fireplace."

480
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,684
The first time we met
I really didn't like you that much.

481
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,564
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

482
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,968
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

483
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,971
I hate that kind of remark. It sounds
like a compliment, but it's an insult.

484
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,128
OK, you're still as hard as nails.

485
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,687
I didn't wanna sleep with you
so you wrote it off as a character flaw,

486
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,011
instead of dealing with the possibility
it might have something to do with you.

487
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,488
What's the statute of limitations
on apologies?

488
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,082
- Ten years.
- I can just get it in under the wire.

489
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,246
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

490
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,081
Are we becoming friends now?

491
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,244
Well...

492
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,600
Yeah.

493
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,731
Great! A woman friend.

494
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,727
You may be the first attractive woman I've
not wanted to sleep with in my entire life.

495
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,081
That's wonderful, Harry.

496
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,370
- We were born in the same hospital,...
- ln 1921 .

497
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,926
- ..seven days apart.
- ln the same hospital.

498
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,044
- We both grew up one block apart.
- We lived in tenements.

499
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,925
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

500
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,010
- I moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

501
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,964
- She moved when she was 1 1 .
- I lived on 183rd Street.

502
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,120
- She worked on the 1 5th floor as a nurse.
- I worked for a prominent neurologist,...

503
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,164
- I had a practice on the 14th floor.
- ..Dr Permelman.

504
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,567
- We never met.
- Never met.

505
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,207
- Can you imagine that?
- D'you know where we met? An elevator.

506
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,085
- I was visiting family.
- ln the Ambassador Hotel.

507
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,771
He was on the third floor,
I was on the 1 2th.

508
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,362
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

509
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,847
Nine extra floors.

510
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,126
- Hello.
- You sleeping?

511
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,891
- No, I was watching "Casablanca".
- Channel?

512
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,606
- Eleven.
- Thank you. Got it.

513
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,641
So you'd be happier with Victor Laszlo
than with Humphrey Bogart?

514
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,730
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

515
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,129
- I never said that. I'd never say that.
- All right, fine. Have it your way.

516
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,968
- Have you been sleeping?
- Why?

517
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,846
Cos I haven't been sleeping.
I really miss Helen.

518
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,246
Maybe I'm coming down with something. I
watched "Leave It to Beaver" in Spanish.

519
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,081
"Buenos días, Seòor Cleaver.
?Dónde están Wallace y Theodore?"

520
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,361
I'm not well.

521
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,286
I went to bed at 7.30.
I haven't done that since third grade.

522
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,324
That's the good thing
about depression - you rest.

523
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,410
- I'm not depressed.
- OK. Fine.

524
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,291
Do you still sleep
on the same side ofthe bed?

525
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,880
I did for a while,
but now I'm using the whole bed.

526
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,767
God, that's great. I feel weird
when just my leg wanders over.

527
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,602
I miss her.

528
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,167
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

529
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,248
You know what I miss?

530
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,567
I miss the idea ofhim.

531
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,527
Maybe I only miss the idea ofHelen.

532
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,687
No, I miss the whole Helen.

533
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,402
Last scene.

534
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,330
Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

535
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,084
lngrid Bergman. She's low maintenance.

536
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,680
- Low maintenance?
- There are two kinds of women.

537
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,930
- High maintenance and low maintenance.
- And lngrid is low maintenance?

538
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,883
An LM, definitely.

539
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,968
- Which one am I?
- The worst kind.

540
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,765
You're high maintenance,
but you think you're low.

541
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,962
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

542
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,050
"Waiter, a house salad,
but not the regular dressing."

543
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,481
"I'll have balsamic vinegar - on the side."

544
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,888
"Then salmon with mustard sauce,
but I want the sauce on the side."

545
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,686
- "On the side" is a big thing for you.
- I just want it the way I want it.

546
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,768
I know. High maintenance.

547
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,890
.. 10,000F should pay our expenses.

548
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,968
Our expenses?

549
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,290
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

550
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,769
Best last line of a movie ever.

551
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,884
I'm definitely coming down with
something. Probably a 24-hour tumour.

552
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,082
- You don't have a tumour.
- How do you know?

553
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,047
- If you're so worried, go see a doctor.
- No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

554
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,606
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be OK.

555
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,849
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

556
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,725
Maybe I should practise now.

557
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,326
Good night, Harry.

558
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,408
Good night.

559
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,485
I had my dream again - where I'm making
love and Olympic judges are watching?

560
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,365
I'd nailed the compulsories,
so this is it: the finals.

561
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,802
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American,

562
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,322
and my mother, disguised as
an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

563
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,647
Must've been the dismount.

564
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,844
Basically it's the same one
I've had since I was 1 2.

565
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,611
- What happens?
- No, it's... It's too embarrassing.

566
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,007
- Don't tell me.
- OK, there's this guy.

567
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,647
- What's he look like?
- I don't know. He's just kinda faceless.

568
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,923
A faceless guy. OK. Then what happens?

569
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,042
He rips off my clothes.

570
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,051
- Then what happens?
- That's it.

571
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,610
That's it? A faceless guy
rips off your clothes.

572
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,805
And that's the sex fantasy you've had
since you were 12. Exactly the same?

573
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,571
Well, sometimes I vary it a little.

574
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,047
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

575
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,247
- What?
- Nothing.

576
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,522
I have decided that for today

577
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,166
we are going to talk like this.

578
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,409
- Like this?
- No. To repeat after me.

579
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,567
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

580
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,602
- Pepper.
- Pepper!

581
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,528
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

582
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,323
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

583
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,445
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

584
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,330
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

585
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,643
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

586
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,364
Oh, no!

587
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,448
- But I would be proud.
- But I would be proud.

588
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,686
- To partake.
- To partake.

589
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,690
- Of your pecan pie.
- Of your pecan pie.

590
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,370
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

591
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,007
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie!

592
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,528
- Would you like to go to the movies?
- Would you like to go...

593
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,363
Not to repeat. Please, to answer. Would
you like to go to the movies tonight?

594
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,368
Well, I'd love to, Harry, but I can't.

595
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,450
What do you have? A hot date?

596
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,001
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

597
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,205
Yeah. I was gonna tell you,
but, I don't know, I felt strange about it.

598
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,761
- Why?
- Cos we've spent so much time together.

599
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,451
I think it's great that you have a date.

600
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,528
- You do?
- Yeah.

601
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,605
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,690
Well, I don't know. Why?

603
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,641
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

604
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,240
- I do?
- Yeah.

605
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,607
I think hieroglyphics are really a comic
strip about a character named Sphinxy.

606
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,167
- Harry, you should get out there, too.
- I'm not ready.

607
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,648
- You should.
- I would not be good for anybody now.

608
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,444
It's time.

609
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,803
It was the most
uncomfortable night of my life.

610
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,888
See, no, it has to go this way.

611
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,691
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

612
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,768
You only had one date.

613
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,168
- How do you know it won't get worse?
- How much worse can it get

614
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,605
than finishing dinner, having him pull
a hair out of my head and floss with it?

615
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,485
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

616
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,002
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

617
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,681
And we're talking in this Ethiopian
restaurant she wanted to go to.

618
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,088
I was making jokes, like
"I didn't know they had food in Ethiopia."

619
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,807
"This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

620
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,127
Yeah! Nothing from her, not even a smile.

621
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,369
I downshift into small talk
and ask where she went to school.

622
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,563
She says Michigan State.
And this reminds me of Helen.

623
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,809
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of an anxiety attack -

624
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,810
my heart's beatin' fast
and I start sweatin' like a pig.

625
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,764
- Helen went to Michigan State?
- No, Northwestern.

626
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,042
But they're both Big Ten schools.

627
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,130
I got so upset
I had to leave the restaurant.

628
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,367
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

629
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,565
It might be months before we're able
to enjoy going out with someone new.

630
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,647
Yeah.

631
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,923
Maybe longer before we're able
to go to bed with someone new.

632
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,281
I went to bed with her.

633
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,290
- You went to bed with her?!
- Sure.

634
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,930
- I don't understand this relationship.
- What d'ya mean?

635
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,690
- Enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

636
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,768
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

637
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,008
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

638
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,282
You're afraid to let yourself be happy.

639
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,688
Why can't you gimme credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

640
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,521
I never had a relationship with a woman
that didn't involve sex. I'm growing.

641
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,122
- Are you finished?
- I got a stack o' quarters. I was here first.

642
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,082
- Were not.
- Was too.

643
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,089
- Were not!
- Was too!

644
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,680
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

645
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,609
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

646
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,290
Yeah.

647
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,483
It's very freeing. I can say anything to her.

648
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,283
Are you saying you can say things to her
you can't say to me?

649
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,042
No, it's just a different perspective.
I get the woman's point of view on things.

650
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,767
She tells me about the men she sees,
and I talk to her about the women I see.

651
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,962
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

652
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,607
Like the other night, I made love
to this woman and it was incredible.

653
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,327
I took her to a place that wasn't human.
She actually meowed.

654
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,764
- You made a woman meow?
- Yeah, and I can say these things to her.

655
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,124
And the great thing is, I don't have to lie
because I don't wanna get her into bed.

656
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,131
- I can just be myself.
- You made a woman meow?

657
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,044
What do you do with these women?
Just get up and leave?

658
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,448
- Sure.
- Explain how you do it. What do you say?

659
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
I say I have an early meeting,
early squash game.

660
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,290
- You don't play squash.
- They don't know that. They just met me.

661
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,131
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

662
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,402
I'm so glad I never got involved with you.

663
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,320
I just would've been some woman you
had to get outta bed and leave at 3am

664
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,569
and go clean your andirons.
You don't even have a fireplace.

665
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,366
- Not that I would know this.
- Why are you upset? This isn't about you.

666
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,485
Yes, it is! You are a human affront
to all women, and I am a woman.

667
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,365
Hey, I don't hear anyone complaining.

668
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,245
Of course not.
You're out the door too fast.

669
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,569
- I think they have an OK time.
- How do you know?

670
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,407
What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.

671
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,206
- Because they...
- Yes, because they...

672
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,681
- How do you know that they're really...
- What're you saying? They fake orgasm?

673
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,401
- It's possible.
- Get outta here!

674
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,490
Why? Most women
at one time or another have faked it.

675
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,690
- They haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

676
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,371
Because I know.

677
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,962
Right. That's right.

678
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,287
I forgot. You're a man.

679
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,522
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

680
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,281
All men are sure it never happened
to them and most women have done it,

681
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,368
so you do the math.

682
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,960
You don't think I could tell the difference?

683
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,765
- No.
- Get outta here.

684
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,204
Are you OK?

685
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,929
Oh, God.

686
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,362
Oh, God.

687
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,286
Oh, God.

688
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,050
Oh, yeah, right there.

689
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,488
Oh, God.

690
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,570
Yes! Yes! Yes!

691
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,325
Yes! Yes!

692
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,408
Yes!

693
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,604
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

694
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,844
Yes! Yes! Yes!

695
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,281
Yes! Yes! Yes!

696
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,928
Oh, God.

697
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,124
I'll have what she's having.

698
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,042
~ Sleigh bells ring

699
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,049
~ Are you listening?

700
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,286
~ ln the lane snow is glistening

701
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,768
~ A beautiful sight

702
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,167
~ We're happy tonight

703
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,204
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

704
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,006
~ Gone away is the bluebird

705
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,690
~ Here to stay is a new bird

706
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,525
~ He sings a love song as we go along

707
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,201
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

708
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,968
~ ln the meadow we can build a snowman

709
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,401
~ And pretend that he is Parson Brown

710
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,604
~ He'll say "Are you married?"

711
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,007
~ We'll say "No, man"

712
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,841
~ "But you can do thejob
when you're in town, brother"

713
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,931
~ Later on we'll conspire

714
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,288
~ As we dream by the fire

715
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,010
~ To face unafraid the plans that we made

716
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,851
~ Walking in a winter wonderland

717
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,363
~ lf they asked me

718
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,847
~ I could write a book

719
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,684
~ About the way you walk and whisper...

720
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,441
- I like you with no beard. I see your face.
- It is my face!

721
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,762
Whoa! Dipping you.

722
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,649
- Thank you for taking me out tonight.
- Don't be silly.

723
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,526
The next New Year's Eve, if neither
of us is with anybody, you got a date.

724
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,404
Deal.

725
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,404
See? Now we can dance cheek to cheek.

726
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,600
~ lsjust to tell them

727
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,690
~ That I love you a lot

728
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,722
~ Then the world discovers

729
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,561
~ As my book ends

730
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,685
~ How to make two lovers

731
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,882
~ Of friends

732
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,482
Hey, everybody!
Ten seconds to New Year!

733
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,841
- Ten,...
- Wanna get some air?

734
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,930
- Yeah.
- ..seven, six, five, four,

735
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,281
three, two, one!

736
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,368
Happy New Year!

737
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,968
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

738
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,286
He was a head counsellor at boys' camp,
I was a head counsellor at girls' camp,

739
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,121
and they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

740
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,130
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine,

741
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,847
cos people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

742
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,691
But he was coming to talk to me,
and he said

743
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,690
"I'm Ben Small
of the Coney lsland Smalls."

744
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,089
At that moment I knew. I knew
the way you know about a good melon.

745
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,571
You sent flowers to yourself.

746
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,321
$60 I spent on this big arrangement
of flowers, and I wrote a card

747
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,365
that I planned to leave on the table
where Arthur would just happen to see it.

748
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,721
What did the card say?

749
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,320
"Please say yes. Love Jonathan."

750
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,522
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

751
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,565
He forgot a charity thing his wife is
chairman of. He's never gonna leave her!

752
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,968
- Of course he isn't.
- You're right. I know you're right.

753
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,562
- Where is this place?
- Somewhere on the next block.

754
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,409
I can't believe I'm doing this.

755
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,888
Harry is one of my best friends
and you are one of my best friends.

756
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,244
And if you two hit it off, we could still
be friends, instead of drifting apart

757
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,330
like you do when you date someone
who doesn't know your friends.

758
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,331
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

759
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,922
If Arthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him,

760
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,408
I am sure that you and I would drift apart.

761
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,522
He's never gonna leave her.

762
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,642
Of course he isn't.

763
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,808
You're right. I know you're right.

764
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,482
- I dunno about this.
- It's just a dinner.

765
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,561
I've finally gotten to a place where I'm
comfortable with just me and my work.

766
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,321
- If she's so great why don't you date her?
- I told you. We're just friends.

767
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,171
- So she's not attractive?
- No, she is attractive.

768
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,683
- You said she had a good personality.
- She has a good personality.

769
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,605
What?

770
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,850
When someone's not attractive, they're
described as having a good personality.

771
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,601
If you'd asked about looks and
I'd said "She has a good personality",

772
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,449
she's not attractive.

773
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,962
But because I mentioned she has
a good personality, she can be either.

774
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,721
Attractive with a good personality,
or not attractive with a good personality.

775
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,808
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

776
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,082
But not beautiful, right?

777
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,521
It's like, whenever I read Jimmy Breslin,
it's as if he's leaving a wake-up call

778
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,611
- for the City of New York.
- What d'you mean by a "wake-up call"?

779
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,805
He's saying that we've got people
in the city who are on welfare...

780
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,128
Would I have seen any of your windows?

781
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:55,529
A couple of weeks ago
I did a thing with hostages.

782
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,404
- The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

783
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,929
I thought it was like late '80s.

784
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,965
That's interesting.

785
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,924
Let's just say I'm not
a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

786
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,409
Well, he's the reason I became a writer,
but that's not important.

787
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,162
Harry, you and Marie
are both from New Jersey.

788
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,725
- Really?
- Where?

789
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,410
- South Orange.
- Haddonfield.

790
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,051
- So, what are we gonna order?
- I'm gonna start with the grilled radicchio.

791
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,448
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.
Not only does she pick the best,

792
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,007
but she orders it in a way even the chef
didn't know how good it could be.

793
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,169
- Restaurants have become too important.
- I agree.

794
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,410
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theatre was to people in the '60s."

795
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,841
I read that in a magazine.

796
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,962
I wrote that.

797
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,651
- Get outta here.
- No, I did! I wrote that.

798
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,043
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine. That's amazing.

799
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,562
Don't you think that's amazing?
And you wrote it?

800
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,081
I also wrote
"Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."

801
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,851
- Get over yourself!
- I did!

802
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,487
- Where did I read that?
- New York Magazine.

803
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,887
Sally writes for New York Magazine.

804
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,130
You know, that piece had a real impact
on me. I don't know much about writing...

805
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,368
It spoke to you, and that pleases me.

806
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,962
I mean, you have to admire people
who can be that articulate.

807
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,562
Nobody has ever quoted
me back to me before.

808
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,210
I've been looking for a red suede pump.

809
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,561
What do you think of Jess?

810
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,723
- Well...
- Do you think you could go out with him?

811
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,206
- I don't know...
- Cos I feel really comfortable with him.

812
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,449
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

813
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,450
Sure. Sure. I'm just worried about Harry.

814
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,441
He's sensitive, he's going through a rough
period, and I don't want you to reject him.

815
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,767
I wouldn't. I totally understand.

816
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,248
If you don't think you're gonna call Marie,
do you mind if I call her?

817
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,930
- No, no.
- Good. Good.

818
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,091
But for tonight you shouldn't.
I mean, Sally's very vulnerable right now.

819
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,046
You can call Marie, but wait a week or so.
Don't make any moves tonight.

820
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,642
Fine. No problem.
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

821
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,767
Well, I don't feel like walking any more.
I think I'll get a cab.

822
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,850
- I'll go with you.
- Great! Taxi!

823
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,404
A man came to me and said
"I found nice girl for you."

824
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,525
"She lives in the next village

825
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,803
and she is ready for marriage."

826
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,050
We were not supposed to meet
until the wedding,

827
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,162
but I wanted to make sure.

828
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,444
So I sneak into her village,
hid behind a tree,

829
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,211
watch her washing the clothes.

830
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,524
I think if I don't like the way she looks,
I don't marry her.

831
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,371
But she looked very nice to me.

832
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,450
So I said "OK" to the man.

833
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,924
We get married.

834
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,930
We married for 55 years.

835
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,649
FOUR MONTHS LATER

836
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,963
- I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

837
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,801
- We'll find something. Great stuff.
- Should have gone to the plant store.

838
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,049
- Here. Perfect for them.
- What's that?

839
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,686
Battery-operated pith helmet, with fan.

840
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,646
- Why is this necessary in life?
- I don't know.

841
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,604
Look at this. Also makes great fries.

842
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,610
Good. Call off the dogs. The hunt is over.

843
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,530
Sally, this is the greatest.

844
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,847
Sally, please report to me.

845
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,645
Look. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

846
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,846
This is a singing machine. Look, you sing
the lead and this has the backup.

847
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,964
- This is from Oklahoma!
- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top".

848
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,401
Yes, perfect.

849
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,130
~ Chicks and ducks and geese
better scurry

850
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,050
~ When I take you out in my surrey

851
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,210
~ When I take you out in my surrey
with the fringe on top

852
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,481
Now you!

853
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,001
~ Watch that fringe and see how it flutters

854
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,771
~ When I drive those
high-steppin' strutters

855
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,803
~ Nosey pokes'll
peek through the shutters

856
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,400
~ And their eyes will pop!

857
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,524
~ The wheels are yellow,
the upholstery's brown

858
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,768
~ The dashboard's genuine leather

859
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,451
~ With isinglass curtains that will ro...

860
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,564
What?

861
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,650
It's my voice, isn't it? You hate my voice.

862
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,128
- I know, it's terrible. Joe hated it...
- It's Helen.

863
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,129
Helen?

864
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,607
She's coming right towards me.

865
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,408
- How are you, Harry?
- Fine. I'm fine.

866
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,811
This is Ira Stone. Harry Burns.

867
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,684
Harry.

868
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,890
I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright.
Helen Hillson

869
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,764
and Ira.

870
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,764
Sally.

871
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,884
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

872
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,849
Well...

873
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,803
- See you.
- Yeah. Bye.

874
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,447
Nice to meet you, Ira.

875
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,368
You OK?

876
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,961
Yeah, I'm perfect.

877
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,323
She looked weird, didn't she?
She looked really weird.

878
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,047
- I've never seen her before.
- Trust me. Her legs looked heavy.

879
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,924
- Must be retaining water.
- Harry!

880
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,646
Believe me, the woman saved everything.

881
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,642
Sure you're OK?

882
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,570
I'm fine.
Look, it had to happen at some point.

883
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,685
In a city of eight million, you're bound
to run into your ex-wife. So it happened.

884
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,768
And now I'm fine.

885
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,331
I like it. It works. It says "home" to me.

886
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,126
All right. All right.
We'll let Harry and Sally be the judge.

887
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,121
What do you think?

888
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,083
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

889
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,567
Of course he likes it - he's a guy.

890
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,648
Sally?

891
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,565
What's so awful about it?

892
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,605
It's so awful, there's no way to begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

893
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,927
Honey, I don't object to your things.

894
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,522
If we had room, you could put
your things in it, like your bar stools...

895
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,406
Honey, wait, wait. Honey, wait.
You don't like my bar stools?

896
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,771
Harry, come on,
someone has to be on my side.

897
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,611
I'm on your side.
I just want you to have good taste.

898
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,882
I have good taste!

899
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,847
Everybody thinks they have good taste,
but they couldn't all have good taste.

900
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,646
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

901
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,049
We hung things, we picked out tiles
together. Then you know what happens?

902
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,446
Six years later you're singing "Surrey
with the Fringe on Top" in front of lra!

903
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,248
- Do we have to talk about this right now?
- Yes. Right now is the perfect time,

904
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,251
because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

905
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,729
Right now everything is great. Everyone
is happy and in love, and that's wonderful.

906
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:46,006
But sooner or later, you'll be screaming
at each other about who'll get this dish.

907
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,001
This $8 dish will cost $1 ,000 in calls to the
legal firm of "That's mine, this is yours".

908
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,009
- Harry!
- Please.

909
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,203
Jess, Marie,
do me a favour for your own good.

910
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,450
Put your name in your books right now
before you don't know whose is whose,

911
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,487
because some day you'll go 1 5 rounds
over who's gonna get this coffee table.

912
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,966
This stupid, wagon-wheel,
Roy-Rogers, garage-sale coffee table!

913
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,241
- I thought you liked it.
- I was being nice!

914
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,402
He just bumped into Helen.

915
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,445
I want you to know

916
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,531
that I will never want
that wagon-wheel coffee table.

917
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,929
I know, I know, I shouldn't have done it.

918
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,602
Harry, you have to try to find a way of
not expressing every feeling you have,

919
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,688
every moment that you have them.

920
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,246
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

921
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,931
There are times and places for things.

922
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,641
Well, the next time you're giving a lecture
on social graces, tell me cos I'll sign up.

923
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,242
Hey! You don't have
to take your anger out on me.

924
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,362
I'm entitled to throw anger your way.

925
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,451
Especially when I'm being told how
to live my life by Miss Hospital Corners!

926
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,962
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing bothers you!

927
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,641
- You never get upset about anything!
- Don't be ridiculous!

928
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,125
What?

929
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,404
You never get upset about Joe. I never
see it back up on you. How is it possible?

930
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,650
- Don't you experience feelings of loss?
- I don't have to take this crap.

931
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,207
- If you're over Joe, why not see people?
- I see people!

932
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,642
See people! Have you slept
with one person since Joe?

933
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,445
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

934
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,326
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?!

935
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,240
You have to move back to New Jersey cos
you've slept with everyone in New York.

936
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,728
I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

937
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,764
Besides, I will make love
when it is making love.

938
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,090
Not the way you do it,
like you're out for revenge or something.

939
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,851
Are you finished now?

940
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,405
Yes.

941
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,807
Can I say something?

942
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,490
Yes.

943
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,611
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

944
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,367
Don't say a word!

945
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,884
It's a monkey, a monkey.
Monkey see, monkey do.

946
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,322
- It's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

947
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,649
- Planet ofthe Apes!
- She said baby! Try Planet ofthe Dopes.

948
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,446
- It doesn't look like a baby.
- Big mouth. Jagger as a baby.

949
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,040
- Baby ape!
- Stop with the apes.

950
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,243
- Baby's breath.
- Rosemary's Baby's mouth?

951
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,761
- "Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?"
- Kiss the baby!

952
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,249
- "Melancholy Baby's Mouth"!
- Baby fish... Baby-fish mouth!

953
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,963
- 1 5 seconds.
- A big mouth.

954
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,003
- Baby boom!
- Baby...

955
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,646
Draw something resembling anything!

956
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,207
- Crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up... Exorcist Baby!

957
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,081
- "Yes Sir, That's My Baby".
- "No sir, don't mean maybe."

958
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,885
- That's it. Time's up.
- Baby talk.

959
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,243
Baby talk? What's that?
That's not a saying.

960
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,206
But "baby-fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation! I hear them talking!

961
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,721
Final score. Our team: 1 10.

962
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,808
You guys: 60.

963
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,924
- Ouch. Fix! Definitely a fix.
- Pathetic.

964
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,167
- I can't draw.
- That's a baby, and it's clearly talking.

965
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,044
You're wonderful.

966
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,925
- Who wants coffee?
- I do, and I love you.

967
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,805
- D'you have tea?
- lndustrial strength.

968
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,242
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

969
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,929
- Three.
- Yes, please.

970
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,487
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

971
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,569
Never looked like a baby to me.

972
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,125
- Which part?
- All of it.

973
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,483
- You were gonna show me a book cover.
- Yeah, it's in the den.

974
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:09,685
Julian, help yourself.
Have some more wine, whatever, OK?

975
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,962
I like saying den. Got a nice ring to it.

976
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,211
Emily's a little young for Harry,
don't you think?

977
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,005
Well, she's young,
but look what she's done.

978
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,407
What has she done? She makes desserts.

979
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,730
- Does Julian seem a little stuffy to you?
- He's a good guy. You should talk to him.

980
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,205
He's too tall to talk to.

981
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,324
She makes 3,500
chocolate-mousse pies a week.

982
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,842
Emily is "Aunt Emily"?

983
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,327
He took us to a Met game last week.
It was great.

984
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,764
- You all went to a Met game together?
- Yeah, but it was a last-minute thing.

985
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,245
But Sally hates baseball.

986
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,522
Harry doesn't even like sweets.

987
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,086
Julian is great.

988
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,123
I know. He's a grown-up.

989
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,528
- Emily is terrific.
- Yeah. But when I asked where she was

990
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,087
when Kennedy was shot,
she said "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

991
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,522
- Hello?
- Are you alone?

992
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,642
Yeah. I was just finishing a book.

993
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,525
- Could you come over?
- What's the matter?

994
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,491
- He's getting married.
- Who?

995
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,685
Joe!

996
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,130
I'll be right there.

997
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,730
- Hi.
- Are you all right?

998
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,242
Come on in.

999
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,810
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

1000
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,288
- I need a Kleenex!
- OK.

1001
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,845
OK. OK.

1002
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,091
He just called me up,
"Wanted to see how you were",

1003
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,521
"Fine. How are you?" "Fine."

1004
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,122
His secretary's on vacation,
everything's all backed up.

1005
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,847
He's got a big case in Newark,
blah, blah, blah.

1006
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,050
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking
"I am over him, I really am over him,

1007
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,085
I can't believe I was ever
remotely interested in any of this."

1008
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,243
And then he said "I have some news."

1009
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,084
She works in his office. She's a paralegal.
Her name is Kimberly.

1010
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,848
He just met her!

1011
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:26,251
She's supposed to be his
transitional person, not "the one"!

1012
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,002
All this time, I've been saying
that he didn't wanna get married.

1013
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,562
But the truth is,

1014
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,251
he didn't wanna marry me.

1015
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,402
He didn't love me.

1016
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,851
If you could take him back
right now, would you?

1017
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,608
No!

1018
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,451
But why didn't he wanna marry me?

1019
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,931
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

1020
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,281
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

1021
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,802
- I'm too structured. I'm closed off.
- But in a good way.

1022
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,043
No, no, no. I drove him away.

1023
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,362
And I'm gonna be 40!

1024
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,930
When?

1025
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,281
- Some day.
- ln eight years.

1026
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,721
But it's there! It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

1027
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:35,011
And it's not the same for men. Charlie
Chaplin had babies when he was 73.

1028
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,248
Yeah, but he was too old to pick 'em up.

1029
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,448
Come here. Come here.

1030
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,369
It's gonna be OK.

1031
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,721
It's gonna be fine, you'll see.

1032
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,804
Go ahead. It's not one
of my favourites anyway.

1033
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,967
It's gonna be OK. Hm?

1034
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,762
Hm? OK?

1035
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,644
OK.

1036
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,166
- I'll make some tea.
- Harry, could you hold me a little longer?

1037
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,089
Oh, sure.

1038
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,201
OK? Hm?

1039
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,723
Are you comfortable?

1040
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,604
Sure.

1041
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,086
- D'you want something to drink?
- No, I'm OK.

1042
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,847
I'm going to get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

1043
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,928
OK. Water.

1044
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:11,642
You have all your video tapes
alphabetised and on index cards.

1045
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,125
Thank you.

1046
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,768
- D'you wanna watch something?
- No. Not unless you do.

1047
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,328
No. That's OK.

1048
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,202
- D'you wanna go to sleep?
- OK.

1049
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,407
Where are you going?

1050
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,887
I gotta go.

1051
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,129
Gotta go home, change my clothes
and go to work. And so do you.

1052
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,881
But after work I'd like to take you
out to dinner, if you're free. You free?

1053
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,446
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

1054
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,242
- Fine.
- Fine.

1055
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,568
- Yours!
- Hello.

1056
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,887
- Sorry to call so early.
- Are you all right?

1057
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,288
No one I know would call at this hour.

1058
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,368
- No one I know would call.
- It's awful.

1059
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,244
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

1060
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,283
- Harry came over.
- I went to Sally's.

1061
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,051
- I was upset Joe was marrying.
- One thing led to another.

1062
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,323
- Before I knew it we were kissing. Then...
- ..we did it.

1063
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,601
They did it!

1064
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,688
- That's great!
- We prayed for it.

1065
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,406
- You shoulda done it before.
- We said you should do it.

1066
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,046
- You belong together.
- You killed two birds with one stone.

1067
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,686
- Two wrongs make a right.
- How was it?

1068
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,290
- During part was good,...
- Good,...

1069
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,368
- ..then I felt suffocated.
- ..then it wasn't.

1070
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,686
- Sorry.
- The worst.

1071
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,131
- I had to go.
- He left.

1072
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,890
- I feel bad.
- I'm embarrassed.

1073
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,206
I don't blame you.

1074
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,243
- I feel ill.
- I'm catching a cold.

1075
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,964
Look, it didn't work out.

1076
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,448
Never sleep with anyone
when you find out your ex is marrying.

1077
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,369
- Who's talking?
- Is that Jess?

1078
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,926
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.
- It's Bryant Gumbel.

1079
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,565
Wanna have breakfast?

1080
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,682
- No, I'm not up to it.
- I feel too awful.

1081
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,643
- Good.
- I mean, it's so early.

1082
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,127
- But call me later.
- I'll call you later.

1083
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,446
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

1084
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,528
- Bye.
- Bye.

1085
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,291
- God!
- I know.

1086
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,290
Tell me I'll never have to be
out there again.

1087
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,205
You will never have to be out there again.

1088
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,687
I'll just say we made a mistake.

1089
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,165
Sally, it was a mistake.

1090
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,841
I just hope I get to say it first.

1091
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,206
I hope she says it before I do.

1092
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,681
- It was a mistake.
- I am so relieved that you think so, too.

1093
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,045
I'm not saying last night wasn't great.

1094
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,004
- It was!
- Yes, it was!

1095
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,368
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

1096
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,803
- I am so relieved!
- Great.

1097
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,888
Yeah.

1098
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,008
Two mixed green salads.

1099
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:21,047
It is so nice when you can sit
with someone and not have to talk. Hm?

1100
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,241
Most of the time,
you go to bed with someone,

1101
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,285
then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her all your stories.

1102
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,041
But with Sally and me,
we'd already heard each other's stories.

1103
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,051
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do. You know?

1104
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,288
Sure, Harry.

1105
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,570
I don't know.

1106
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:49,050
Maybe you get to a point in a relationship
where it's too late to have sex. You know?

1107
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,561
Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?

1108
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,648
I don't think so.

1109
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:09,285
- Is he seeing anyone?
- He was seeing this anthropologist, but...

1110
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:14,245
- What does she look like?
- Thin, pretty, big tits.

1111
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,806
Your basic nightmare.

1112
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,482
What d'ya think?

1113
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,609
Marie...

1114
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,084
Tell the truth.

1115
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,887
It's just beautiful.

1116
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:07,730
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Marie and Jess.

1117
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,563
And to consecrate
their vows of matrimony.

1118
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:15,048
The vows they will take join their lives.

1119
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:20,087
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

1120
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,441
And by the rings they will wear,

1121
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,282
they will be known to all
as husband and wife.

1122
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,807
I've never seen her so happy.
She's a different person.

1123
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:45,482
Oh, yeah, she is. It's great,
but what're we gonna do about you?

1124
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,921
- Me?
- Hon, you wanna dance?

1125
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,407
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, I do.
- Excuse us.

1126
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,291
- Hi.
- Hello.

1127
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,770
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

1128
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,320
Boy, the holidays are rough! Every year I
try to get from Thanksgiving to New Year.

1129
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,727
A lot of suicides.

1130
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,764
- Would you like a pea pod with shrimp?
- Thank you.

1131
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,611
- How've you been?
- Fine.

1132
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,324
- Seeing anybody?
- Harry.

1133
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,363
- What?
- I don't wanna talk about this.

1134
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,927
- Why not?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1135
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:32,170
Why can't we get past this? Are we
gonna carry this thing around for ever?

1136
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,524
- Forever? It just happened!
- It happened three weeks ago.

1137
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,440
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

1138
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,244
Yes!

1139
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,204
Is one of us supposed to be a dog
in this scenario?

1140
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,847
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

1141
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,083
- You are.
- I am! I am the dog!

1142
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,567
I am the dog! I...

1143
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,321
I don't see that. You are the dog. You act
like what happened didn't mean anything.

1144
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,410
No, I don't, but why
does it have to mean everything?

1145
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,731
Because it does! You know it better than
anyone, cos after it happens you walk out!

1146
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,730
- I didn't walk out.
- Sprinted is more like it.

1147
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,083
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made!

1148
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,723
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

1149
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:30,529
Fine! But let's just get one thing straight. I
did not go over there to make love to you.

1150
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,531
But you looked at me with these weepy
eyes: "Don't go home. Hold me, Harry."

1151
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,361
- What was I supposed to do?
- Are you saying you took pity on me?

1152
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,051
- No! I was...
- Fuck you!

1153
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,449
Everybody, could I have
your attention, please?

1154
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:51,645
I'd like to propose a toast,
to Harry and Sally.

1155
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,569
To Harry and Sally.

1156
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,969
If Marie or I had found either of them
remotely attractive,

1157
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,084
we would not be here today.

1158
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:14,043
~ Have yourselfa merry little Christmas

1159
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,924
~ Let yourselfbe light

1160
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:24,963
~ From now on
our troubles will be out ofsight

1161
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,444
~ Have yourself a merry little Christmas

1162
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,727
~ Make the yuletide gay

1163
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:44,209
~ From now on
our troubles will be miles away

1164
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,121
Hi, it's me. It's the holiday season,

1165
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,642
and I thought I'd remind you
that it's the season of forgiveness.

1166
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,244
And, although it's not widely known,
it is also the season of grovelling.

1167
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,802
So, if you felt like calling me back,

1168
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,960
I'd be more than happy to do
the traditional Christmas grovelling.

1169
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,844
Give me a call.

1170
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,005
Hi, I'm not home. I'll call you right back.

1171
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:27,091
If you're there, please pick up.
I really wanna talk to you.

1172
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:33,963
The fact you're not answering leads me
to believe you're either, A: not at home,

1173
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,243
B: home, but don't wanna talk to me, or C:

1174
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,809
home, desperately wanna talk to me,
but trapped under something heavy.

1175
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,890
If it's either A or C, please call me back.

1176
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,165
Obviously she doesn't wanna talk to me.
What do I have to do, be hit on the head?

1177
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,841
If she wants to call, she'll call.
I'm through actin' like a schmuck.

1178
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,529
~ If you're feeling sad and lonely

1179
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,530
~ There's a service I can render

1180
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,571
~ Tell the one who digs you only

1181
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,923
~ I can be so warm and tender

1182
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,451
~ Call me

1183
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,042
~ Maybe it's late tojust call me

1184
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:16,403
~ Don't be afraid to just phone moi

1185
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,406
~ Call me and I'll be around

1186
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,841
Give me a call.

1187
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,486
- Hi, Harry.
- Hello. Hi! Hi!

1188
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,206
I didn't know that you would...
That you were there.

1189
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:30,131
- What're you doing?
- I was just on my way out.

1190
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,607
Where you going?

1191
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,246
- What do you want, Harry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1192
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,682
I... I just called to say I'm sorry.

1193
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,124
OK.

1194
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,208
- I gotta go.
- Wait a second. Wait... wait a second.

1195
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,609
What're you doin' for New Year's? Going
to the Tylers' party? I don't have a date.

1196
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:02,568
If you don't have a date, we always said
we could be together for New Year's and...

1197
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:06,366
I can't do this any more.
I am not your consolation prize.

1198
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,528
Goodbye.

1199
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,771
And here we are once again. The 16th
annual "New Year's Rockin' Eve",

1200
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,530
coming to you live...

1201
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,447
What's so bad about this?
You got Dick Clark - tradition.

1202
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,245
You got Mallomars,
the greatest cookie of all time.

1203
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:34,888
And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.

1204
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,286
I don't know why I let you drag me to this.

1205
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:02,683
This is much better. Fresh air,
I have the streets all to myself.

1206
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,407
Who needs to be at a big, crowded party,
pretending to have a good time?

1207
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,161
Plus, this is the perfect time
to catch up on my window-shopping.

1208
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,845
This is good.

1209
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,290
So the guy says "Read the card."

1210
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,770
- I'm going home.
- You'll never get a taxi.

1211
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,881
Oh, God!

1212
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,080
You realise that
we could never be friends.

1213
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,441
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

1214
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,087
men and women can't be friends,
cos the sex part always gets in the way.

1215
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,611
That's not true!

1216
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,121
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

1217
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:24,131
- He always wants to have sex with her.
- What if they don't wanna have sex?

1218
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,801
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

1219
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,400
And that is the end ofthe story.

1220
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,205
- I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

1221
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,890
That's too bad.

1222
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,890
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

1223
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:46,328
~ It had to be you

1224
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,369
~ It had to be you

1225
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:00,164
~ I wandered around

1226
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:04,205
~ And I finally found

1227
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,927
~ The somebody who

1228
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:16,604
~ Could make me be true

1229
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,409
~ And could make me be blue...

1230
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,690
- I'm going.
- It's almost midnight!

1231
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:29,641
- The thought of not kissing somebody...
- I'll kiss you.

1232
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,121
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

1233
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,163
Taxi!

1234
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,044
Shit.

1235
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:42,283
- Come on, stay. Please.
- Thanks, Jess. I just... I have to go.

1236
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,051
- Wait two minutes.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

1237
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:50,121
~ Might never be mean

1238
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,881
~ Might never be cross

1239
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,924
~ Or try to be boss

1240
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,329
~ But they wouldn't do

1241
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,405
~ For nobody else

1242
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,808
~ Gave me a thrill

1243
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,366
~ With all your faults

1244
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,404
~ I love you still

1245
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,126
~ It had to be you...

1246
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:27,006
I've been doin' a lot of thinkin',
and the thing is, I love you.

1247
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,771
- What?
- I love you.

1248
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:34,284
- How d'you expect me to respond to this?
- How about you love me, too?

1249
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,651
- How about I'm leaving?
- Doesn't what I said mean anything?

1250
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,560
Sorry, Harry. I know it's New Year's Eve,
I know you're feeling lonely,

1251
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:47,766
but you just can't show up, say you love
me and expect that to make it all right.

1252
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:51,248
- It doesn't work this way.
- Well, how does it work?

1253
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:55,001
- I don't know, but not this way.
- Then how about this way?

1254
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,566
I love that you get cold when it's 71?out.

1255
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,365
I love that it takes you 1 1
2 hours

1256
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,723
I love that you get a crinkle here
when you look at me like I'm nuts.

1257
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:07,526
I love that after I spend a day with you
I smell your perfume on my clothes.

1258
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:12,089
And I love that you are the last person I
wanna talk to before I go to sleep at night.

1259
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,841
And it's not because I'm lonely
or because it's New Year's Eve.

1260
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:20,010
I came cos when you realise you wanna
spend the rest of your life with someone

1261
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:23,408
you want the rest of your life
to start as soon as possible.

1262
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,568
You see?

1263
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,288
That is just like you, Harry.

1264
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,803
You say things like that and you make it
impossible for me to hate you!

1265
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,524
And I hate you, Harry.

1266
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,647
I really hate you.

1267
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,208
I hate you.

1268
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,929
What does this song mean?
My whole life, I don't know.

1269
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,487
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot" -
should we forget old acquaintances?

1270
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,841
Or if we forget them,
should we remember them?

1271
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,645
Which is not possible
cos we already forgot 'em!

1272
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:21,288
Maybe it just means we should remember
that we forgot them, or something.

1273
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,530
Anyway, it's about old friends.

1274
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,446
The first time we met
we hated each other.

1275
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:40,202
No, I hated you. The second time we met,
you didn't even remember me.

1276
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,561
I did, too! I remembered you.

1277
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,126
The third time we met
we became friends.

1278
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:48,528
- We were friends for a long time.
- And then we weren't.

1279
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,927
And then we fell in love.

1280
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:54,767
- Three months later we got married.
- It only took three months.

1281
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,644
12 years and three months.

1282
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,129
- We had a really wonderful wedding.
- It really was a beautiful wedding.

1283
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:05,325
- We had this enormous coconut cake.
- Huge coconut cake with the tiers.

1284
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,364
And there was this very rich
chocolate sauce on the side.

1285
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,802
Right. Cos not everybody likes it
on the cake cos it makes it soggy.

1286
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,448
Particularly, the coconut soaks up a lot,
so it's important to keep it on the side.

1287
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,888
~ It had to be you

1288
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,846
~ It had to be you

1289
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,566
~ I wandered around and finally found

1290
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,808
~ The somebody who

1291
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,321
~ Could make me be true

1292
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,966
~ Could make me be blue

1293
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,686
~ And even be gladjust to be sad

1294
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,201
~ Thinking of you

1295
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,486
~ But you say ee-ther, and I say either

1296
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,921
~ You say nee-ther, I say neither

1297
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,407
~ Ee-ther, either Nee-ther, neither

1298
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,126
~ Let's call the whole thing off

1299
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,561
~ You say potato and I say pot-ahto

1300
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,126
~ You say tomato, I say tom-ahto

1301
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,641
~ Potato, pot-ahto Tomato, tom-ahto

1302
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,206
~ Let's call the whole thing off

1303
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,008
~ Oh, if we call the whole thing off,
then we must part

1304
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:08,411
~ And though if we ever part,
that would break my heart

1305
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,807
~ You say laughter, I say larf-ter

1306
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:13,161
~ You say after, I say arf-ter

1307
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,248
~ Before we know we need each other

1308
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,364
~ So we'd better call, call it off, oh!

1309
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,323
~ Let's
~ Call it off!

1310
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,841
~ Oh, let's
~ Call it off!

1311
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,281
~ Baby, let's
~ Call it off!

1312
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,563
~ Sugar, why don't we

1313
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,843
~ Let's, let's call the whole thing

1314
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:17,400
~ They're writing songs oflove,
but not for me

1315
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,162
~ A lucky star's above, but not for me

1316
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:27,286
~ With love to lead the way,
I've found more clouds ofgrey

1317
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:32,406
~ Than any Russian play could guarantee

1318
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,367
~ I was a fool to fall and get that way

1319
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,289
~ Hi-ho alas

1320
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,529
~ And also lackaday

1321
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:47,885
~ Although I can't dismiss
the memory ofher kiss

1322
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,083
~ I guess she's not for me

1323
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,646
~ It had to be you

1324
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,048
~ It had to be you

1325
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,008
~ For nobody else gave me a thrill

1326
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,125
~ With all your faults, I love you still

1327
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,691
~ It had to be you, wonderful you

1328
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,167
~ It had to be you
