00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:55,055
<i>In October 1957,
the Soviet Union launched</i>

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,435
<i>the world's first artificial satellite,
Sputnik 1, into orbit.</i>

5
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:04,565
<i>Their achievement fueled a space race
between the United States and the Soviets.</i>

6
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,401
<i>There has been some debate
about what followed,</i>

7
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:12,364
<i>but I was there,
and this is the real story. Mostly.</i>

8
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,741
<i>Until two days ago,</i>

9
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,076
<i>that sound had never been heard
on this earth.</i>

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,830
<i>♪ Oh, the moon belongs to everyone ♪</i>

11
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,792
<i>♪ The best things in life, they're free ♪</i>

12
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,295
<i>America attempted
to launch her satellite</i>

13
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,255
<i>with disastrous results.</i>

14
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,970
<i>The Soviet Union
has sent a man into space</i>

15
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,096
<i>and brought him back alive.</i>

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,057
{\an8}<i>The Soviets made the most of the flight</i>

17
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,602
{\an8}<i>in their worldwide propaganda.
Naturally, there was jubilation in Russia.</i>

18
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,565
{\an8}<i>Recognizing the head start obtained
by the Soviets,</i>

19
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,986
{\an8}<i>I believe that this nation should
commit itself to achieving the goal,</i>

20
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,113
<i>before this decade is out,</i>

21
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,992
<i>of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the earth.</i>

22
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,959
{\an8}<i>♪ The best, best things in life ♪</i>

23
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:12,007
{\an8}<i>♪ They are free ♪</i>

24
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,052
<i>We choose to go to
the moon in this decade</i>

25
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,264
<i>and do the other things,
not because they are easy,</i>

26
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,974
<i>but because they are hard.</i>

27
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:23,519
<i>Because that challenge is one
that we are willing to accept,</i>

28
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,313
<i>one we are unwilling to postpone,
and one we intend to win.</i>

29
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,482
<i>Command Pilot.
One, two, three, four, five.</i>

30
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,109
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

31
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,653
<i>Flame!</i>

32
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,864
<i>We've got a fire
in the cockpit.</i>

33
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:37,950
<i>Let's get out! We're burning up!</i>

34
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,121
<i>Astronauts Virgil Grissom, Edward White
and Roger Chaffee have been killed.</i>

35
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,206
<i>Press officials say
because of the tragedy,</i>

36
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,626
<i>the Apollo 1 flight has now
been postponed indefinitely.</i>

37
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,420
<i>I-- It's, uh--</i>
<i>It's a groovy trip,</i>

38
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,090
<i>but there are a lot more important things
to do first in the United States.</i>

39
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,926
<i>Maybe when all that's taken care of,
we can afford to go to the moon.</i>

40
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,555
<i>We find ourselves
rich in goods but ragged in spirit.</i>

41
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,308
<i>Reaching with magnificent precision
for the moon</i>

42
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,560
<i>but falling into raucous discord on earth.</i>

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,687
<i>We are caught at war wanting peace.</i>

44
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,189
<i>We're torn by division wanting unity.</i>

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,108
<i>This giant Saturn rocket</i>

46
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,945
<i>and the rest of the equipment here
began as part of a race</i>

47
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,197
<i>to beat the Russians
with the national goal</i>

48
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,825
<i>of putting a man on the moon
in this decade.</i>

49
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,203
<i>But their trip will cost
more than anyone thought it would.</i>

50
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:28,250
<i>And their chances of landing on the moon
in the 1960s are increasingly slim.</i>

51
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,857
{\an8}First week as manager, Stu.
Doesn't sound like it's going great.

52
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,902
{\an8}So either our meters are off
or there's a breach in one of the tanks.

53
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,863
{\an8}But there's no protocol for this.
And we can't source the leak

54
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,406
{\an8}- because it's liquid hyd--
- Liquid hydrogen.

55
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,825
{\an8}It's colorless and odorless.
Everybody out! Let's go!

56
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,410
{\an8}Reed, Kyle, pencils down.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,663
{\an8}It could be burning,
and we wouldn't know it. Find a door.

58
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,749
{\an8}Come on! Run, run! No walking.

59
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,508
{\an8}What's he doing? Is he cleaning?

60
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,469
{\an8}No, no. It's an--
It's an old-school leak detection process.

61
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,553
It's a broom.

62
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:25,599
Stu, you're better than this. Come on.
Straw plus liquid hydrogen equals...

63
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,567
All right, we're good!
Don't worry about it. Come on.

64
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,027
We got work to do. Let's go.

65
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,623
Uh, the new protocol is the broom method.

66
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:53,585
We need a new broom.

67
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,970
I for sure thought he was dead.

68
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,388
Come on.

69
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,142
- It's still broke

70
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,395
- from the last time you were in a mood.
- Yeah, I can see that.

71
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,398
- Boeing called again.
- Call Congress, Henry, not me.

72
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,775
I don't have their number.

73
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,279
Every day, every day,
something is breaking around here.

74
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,408
{\an8}Or blowing up.
We're underfunded, under-- understaffed.

75
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,744
{\an8}But yeah, we're still expected
to beat the pants off the Russians.

76
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,246
{\an8}You mind telling me how the hell
we're supposed to do that?

77
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,707
{\an8}Could start by being a little nicer
to the vending machines.

78
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,375
Ooh! There it is!

79
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,919
- What?
- There's a cat.

80
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,797
So what?
- It's a black cat, Henry. It's bad luck.

81
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,342
{\an8}- Okay, it's gone.

82
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,472
{\an8}- All right. Thank God.
- Okay. Let's go.

83
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,724
- Call security.
- I won't.

84
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,059
- I will not. It--
- Yes, you will.

85
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:53,729
{\an8}The last thing that we need around here
is a black cat.

86
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,689
They don't deal
with things like this.

87
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,399
Yes, they do. They do now.

88
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,944
- Y-You're overreacting.
- No, you're not overreacting enough.

89
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,781
Call 'em right now. Right now.

90
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,129
How do I look?

91
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,131
You're glowing. Good luck.

92
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,592
- Good afternoon, boys.

93
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,470
Wrong room, sweetheart.
We don't need dictation.

94
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,430
I'm Kelly Jones.
I'll be running the meeting today.

95
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,390
You must be Phil Hunley, Neil Brown and--

96
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,311
Ooh. [chuckles] Zack Tanner.
You don't mind if I sit down, do you?

97
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,439
Uh, all due respect, Mrs. Jones,
we're a progressive company.

98
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,150
We employ 16 women in our steno pool.

99
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,238
We're selling sports cars to men.
We're selling a 300 horsepower--

100
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:48,283
355, 428 cubic inch V-8 beast
is what you're selling.

101
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,370
You want to focus on the car's speed.
Something like this.

102
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:58,085
{\an8}Look familiar? Chevy Camaro.
Pontiac Firebird. And Oldsmobile.

103
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,461
{\an8}All from last month.

104
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,965
Thankfully, you have something
that your competition doesn't have.

105
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:09,221
The Mustang Fastback. "355 horses for him.
Seat belts for the family."

106
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:13,350
The seat belts? We only put them in
because they might be mandatory next year.

107
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,768
Let's play a game.

108
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,647
Now I'm gonna guess what kind of car
each one of you gentlemen drive.

109
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:28,699
Zack, Ford Mustang '66 convertible.
It's poppy red.

110
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:35,289
Oh, no Mustangs for you husbands though.
A Lincoln Continental for Neil.

111
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:43,422
A station wagon for poor Phil. Oh, Phil.
You know what the best part of my day is?

112
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,926
When my husband Charlie
comes home at night.

113
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:55,267
I can't even imagine what it would be like
if-if one night he-- he didn't.

114
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,187
- Now imagine the conversation

115
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:02,441
if someone told your wife that this car,

116
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,152
its 355 horses and 105 top speed,

117
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:10,824
this car is what brings her husband home
safe to her family every night.

118
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,827
Now she wants you to have it.

119
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,539
She says the words every married man
dreams of hearing...

120
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,126
"I'd feel so much better

121
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,880
if you bought yourself
that Mustang, sweetheart."

122
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,931
How did you guess what kind of cars
they drive?

123
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,016
What, bribe their secretaries
or something?

124
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,143
Kelly, seriously?

125
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,687
Two packs of Virginia Slims
and a bottle of Paco Rabanne.

126
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,606
- Everyone has their price.

127
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,525
I'm just lucky that my water didn't break
in there. Oh, God.

128
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,527
Hi, Ron. How's the wife?

129
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,075
Now, the baby bump, dry-clean only.

130
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,578
Yes, I have that noted.
A-Also, Omega confirmed for next week,

131
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,788
I finished the Baskin-Robbins artwork,

132
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,499
and that guy from Palmex asked
for your address to send roses,

133
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,708
but I gave him mine because I know

134
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,877
- how you feel about roses.
- You know how I feel about roses.

135
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:08,257
Also, John called. Again.
He wants to take you to dinner Tuesday.

136
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,968
Tell him I moved to LA.
And call Bruce from Dow Chemical.

137
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,387
I hear they're looking
for a new agency for Ziploc.

138
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,806
People should be boycotting Dow.
They make napalm.

139
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,518
People say they're boycotting,
but they're still buying sandwich bags.

140
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,395
They also sell Saran Wrap and Styrofoam.

141
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,398
Think people are going to stop using
Styrofoam? What's your coffee in?

142
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,109
Now, I know you and your friends want
to save the world,

143
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,653
and by the time
you're running this place in 1984,

144
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,488
there's gonna be no nukes
and equal rights for all.

145
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,573
But until then, we've got a job to do.

146
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:39,413
Kelly! Kelly! Kelly. Kelly.
We've got a big problem.

147
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:43,041
I just stormed off set,
and, yes, it was justified.

148
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,627
I cannot work with these Hoover people.

149
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:50,132
Apparently, they have issues with the way
that I am shooting their commercial.

150
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,342
They actually said that.
"Their." It's my commercial.

151
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,012
They make vacuums. I make art.

152
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,888
- Sorry, did we have a meeting set?
- No. No.

153
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,807
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I had to set a time

154
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,309
to speak to one of my dearest friends.

155
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,728
The last time we spoke, you fired me.
And I don't work for you.

156
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,022
You know what, Kelly,
I didn't come in here to be berated.

157
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,106
I came in to be agreed with!

158
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,818
You have that Nestlé pitch in ten.
Very important.

159
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,695
- That is a lie. Goodbye.

160
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,739
Lance, getting you this directing gig

161
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,449
- was a Christmas miracle.

162
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,035
It took me three weeks to convince them
that you were stable

163
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,830
- after your Jell-O shoot from hell.
Jell-O was not my fault.

164
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,458
- Ugh. That actor wa--
- Was five. You made him cry.

165
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,918
Well, I did that child a favor.
Hollywood is no cakewalk.

166
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,464
What about the Heinz commercial? You went
40,000 over budget. It was about ketchup.

167
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,343
It was not about ketchup.
It was about the promise of ketchup.

168
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,720
No one sees what I'm doing
for their products.

169
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,971
I am elevating them.

170
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,349
I should be in film by now.

171
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,018
I passed on directing <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>.

172
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,146
- That is on me, but still.
- Now, what do we call you, right?

173
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,940
- The Kubrick of commercials. All right.
- Oh, my God. Stanley is a hack.

174
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,984
He does one good movie,
and suddenly he's a genius.

175
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,529
You are a legend, right? Creative genius.

176
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,115
You're also hotheaded, mercurial
and can't stick to a budget for shit.

177
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,992
- Oh, thank you.
- That wasn't a compliment.

178
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,537
- It is when you stop listening.
- If you quit Hoover, you'll be unhirable.

179
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,249
- Okay.

180
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,835
Lance, why don't you march your ass
back to set,

181
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,587
and you apologize
for whatever fit you threw, okay?

182
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,423
Buy your boyfriend something nice
for Christmas for putting up with you.

183
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,800
Get something for me too, okay?

184
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,344
Merry Christmas, Lance.
- Merry Christmas.

185
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,679
Can you get me a decent job, please?

186
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,187
<i>Apollo 8
launched successfully this morning.</i>

187
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:32,025
{\an8}<i>A much needed win for NASA.
In Vietnam, more men were lost today.</i>

188
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,860
<i>...and 15 million miles...</i>

189
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,446
I'll have another round, please,
and a look at the dinner menu.

190
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,739
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks.

191
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,538
Two specials tonight. Chicken potpie
and Oysters Rockefeller.

192
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,875
We'll do the chicken.
She's allergic to oysters.

193
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,380
And I'll take a shot of Macallan, a lemon
and a cutting board.

194
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,508
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Do I know you?

195
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,638
Seat belts in a sports car.
I mean, that's a great angle.

196
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,391
Unfortunately, they're about
to kill the account.

197
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,601
Why would they do that?

198
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:11,314
Because someone told them that
you don't really have a bun in the oven.

199
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,488
Phil. [chuckles] Let me explain.

200
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,532
That's the last time I trust a woman.

201
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,243
- I actually sent you a baby gift.

202
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,162
Which was so sweet, by the way.
Let me just--

203
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,205
Neil, let-let me explain. If you--

204
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,291
What is this? Who do you work for, Ogilvy?

205
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,168
Huh? You can't outsell me,
so you got me fired?

206
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,421
Just the opposite. I wanna hire you.

207
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,050
Name's Moe Berkus.
I work for the president's office.

208
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,177
Of what company?

209
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,932
The president.

210
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:54,274
We need a, uh, marketing specialist,
and word has it you are the very best.

211
00:12:55,358 --> 00:13:00,655
So I did a little digging,
and, uh--

212
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,450
You have quite a colorful past, Kelly.

213
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,328
Or should I call you Jane?
Stewardess from Chicago.

214
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:11,249
Or perhaps you would prefer Amy,
the nurse from Ohio.

215
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,169
Face like that,
who's gonna check references?

216
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,048
Page you're looking for isn't in there.

217
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,721
I don't know what you're talking about.

218
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,224
Oh, sure you don't. And I get it.

219
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:32,187
Hey, I have dozens of IDs,
and my real name's not Moe.

220
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,148
With all the names
you could've picked, you landed on Moe?

221
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,691
You have singular talent.

222
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:41,404
Why waste it selling cars
when you can think bigger?

223
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,284
Well, Moe, what's bigger than Ford?

224
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,832
You ever been to Florida?

225
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,965
{\an8}- They want you to sell the moon?
- The moon. The Apollo mission.

226
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,550
{\an8}The whole thing.

227
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,885
{\an8}And this Moe guy works for NASA?

228
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:08,431
{\an8}Yeah. I mean, y-- Well, no. Um, kind of.
He-He-He works for the government.

229
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,516
Oh, which part?

230
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,270
Kelly?

231
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:19,276
Does this guy-- Are we working
for Richard Nixon?

232
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,778
Because, Kelly, I will not work
for Richard Nixon.

233
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,823
I'm a card-carrying feminist.
I actually have a card.

234
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,700
I can't even believe he's going
to be president.

235
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,286
I had no idea I disagreed
with this much of the country.

236
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:33,915
We are working for NASA to sell the moon.
Nobody disagrees about the moon.

237
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,709
- No. You and I both know

238
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,878
that everywhere around us every day
something terrible is happening.

239
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,046
- Everywhere.

240
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,548
Except in space.

241
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,593
- I hate that this is working on me.
- They definitely need our help.

242
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:48,847
Did you know of NASA's first 29 missions,
only 48% have been successful?

243
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,849
That can't be. That's crazy.

244
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:56,938
Did you know the ratio of men to women
in Cocoa Beach is 5-to-1? [chuckles] Wow.

245
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,567
As long as you got us a quiet place
that's not on Frat Row.

No, this thing's seen worse.

287
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,404
- Been through worse.
- Let me buy a drink for your troubles.

00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,076
Oh, really? An astronaut
who doesn't drink. That's very intriguing.

291
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,163
What makes you think I'm an astronaut?

292
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:21,207
Because you have an Apollo pin,
and only astronauts get those.

I'm Kelly Jones.

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,561
{\an8}Now, today's tour will take approximately
two and a half to three hours.

327
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,897
So let's get comfy-cozy.

328
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,942
Now on the right is our testing facility.

329
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,068
State-of-the-art.

330
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,696
It's on fire.
- It is often on fire.

331
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:01,409
Up ahead, we have
the vehicle assembly building.

332
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,203
That's where they assemble the rockets.

333
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:10,877
That is the tallest single-story building
in the world.

334
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,923
You can fit four Statue of Liberties
inside that building.

335
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,050
Wow. <i>Life Magazine</i> really doesn't
do it justice.

336
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,718
This is so gre-- I'd love to go inside.

337
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,721
- It's highly restricted. I'm sorry.
- Come on, let's get a closer look.

338
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,973
Oh, no, no. No.
There's no entry here.

339
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,434
You need a special access badge to enter.

340
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,186
Oh, like-- like this one?

341
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:31,981
Yeah. That's, uh-- Oh, no, no, no,
that's-- that's my badge.

342
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,734
- Uh, hey-- Oh.
- Look at this place. It's enormous!

343
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,945
- It seems like it's much bigger--
- They took my badge!

344
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,363
I mean, look at this building.

345
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,865
- Hello? That's-That's my badge.
- Hello, sir. Hi.

346
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,326
Kelly Jones from NASA Public Affairs.

347
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,703
Here's our all-access pass for both of us.
Thank you.

348
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,538
Thank you.
- Wait, wait. My card.

349
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:53,962
Now, this I can sell.

350
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,886
Yoo-hoo!

351
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,056
Hello. Boys, boys!

352
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,766
Hi. Kelly Jones.

353
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,143
I'm from the new NASA Public Affairs team.

354
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,020
Can I ask you two a few questions?

355
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,730
Name, age, and what's your job here?

356
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:19,028
Uh, I'm Stu Bryce. One of the, uh,
head engineers, and I'm 24.

357
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,613
- We'll say 35.
- Yeah.

358
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,614
And you?

359
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,450
I'm Don Harper. I-I work for him,
and I'm 23.

360
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,202
You guys are babies.

361
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,997
The average age at NASA is 26.

362
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,499
But w-we do know some old people
that work here as well.

363
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,918
- Yeah, like, 32, 33.
- Yeah.

364
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,212
I'll try not to kill both of you
for saying that.

365
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,340
So, tell us, Stu, what brings you to join
this great American mission?

366
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,760
Well, I s-- saw a, uh, flyer
in my college dorm.

367
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,680
-"A childhood love of the stars."
- That's good.

368
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,056
- That's very moving.
- That's very good.

369
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,433
- And you?
Excuse me?

370
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,854
What are you doing here?

371
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:56,149
Well, I-- I tracked you down to give you
my phone number,

372
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,650
'cause I felt we had a connection.

373
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,987
- What?
- Relax. I'm joking.

374
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,532
I work here now. Moe Berkus brought me on
to revamp NASA Public Affairs.

375
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,577
So you're the killer from Manhattan.

376
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:11,164
And you must be the launch director.
This is my associate, Ruby Martin.

377
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,042
Yeah, I don't care. Look.
This building is completely off-limits.

378
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,044
Everything in here can burn you,
freeze you, fry you,

379
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,046
poison you and crush you.

380
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,506
- So let's go. Out.
<i>How long have you worked here?</i>

381
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,051
- A substantial amount of time.
- Hmm.

382
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,219
- What are you writing?
- Your quote.

383
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,764
That's not a quote.
It was just a thing that I said.

384
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,224
I'll punch it up. Do you have time today
for an interview?

385
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,351
And also, I need to sit down
with your senior officers.

386
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,854
- The photogenic types first.
- I can help with the selection process.

387
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,898
Look, my guys are too weird
for interviews,

388
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,775
and they're actually busy
doing life-and-death work.

389
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,487
Well, you know,
I don't need your permission.

390
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,531
The Americans are over their long
and expensive honeymoon in space,

391
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,367
and I'm here to remind them
why they fell in love in the first place.

392
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,913
Is that right?
Well, Americans should be very grateful

393
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,665
that these men are putting their lives
on the line for the mission.

394
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:58,461
Well, you don't know much
about American people, do you?

395
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:02,256
You don't know very much about
your office I'm about to show you, do you?

396
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,015
Is this a storage closet?

397
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,684
Nope. Storage closet has a window.

398
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,521
Okay, so, instant coffee...
...is in the break room.

399
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,107
Just run the tap for a minute
to flush out the rust.

400
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:23,361
Do either of you know
how to work a fire extinguisher?

401
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,615
No? Mkay. PASS method's pretty simple.

402
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,952
Just, uh, pull the pin, aim,
squeeze, sweep.

403
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,204
If you need anything else,

404
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,374
uh, maybe just go back to New York
and get it. Have a good day.

405
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:41,587
- Well, at least he's easy on the eyes.
- He's hard on the ears though.

406
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,173
Not a great welcome wagon.
I thought you said they wanted our help.

407
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,677
Oh, no. I said they needed our help.
And I do believe that now more than ever.

408
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,054
How are we supposed to do that
if we can't talk to anyone

409
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,515
or look at anything?

410
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,476
Aw, it's a cat. It's a cat.

411
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,769
It's a cat!
- It's a cat.

412
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,771
You know what they say about black cats?

413
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,691
If they cross your path,
they're probably going someplace else.

414
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,319
Okay, time to dig out the old Rolodex.

415
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,364
Let's get creative.

416
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:34,473
Apollo 11 will land our men on the moon,

417
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,226
and that makes us first.

418
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,730
If we do our jobs,
we will launch right from there,

419
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,940
July 16, bright and early.

420
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,609
Between now and then,

421
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:47,486
we will piece together
the biggest jigsaw puzzle

422
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,530
in the history of mankind.

423
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,450
Six million parts spread out
around the country,

424
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,661
and we will assemble, test,
and retest every single one

425
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,206
until we are certain
that Apollo 11 will take off

426
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:01,125
without a hitch and head to the moon in--

427
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:02,710
Henry, sing it.

428
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,630
Seven months. Huh?

429
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,923
Seven months.

430
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:10,426
Please help me congratulate
the astronauts of Apollo 11.

431
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,597
Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins.

432
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:29,320
Hey, hey! How'd you like
the White House, boys? Huh?

433
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,490
Yeah, it was all right, except
Neil wouldn't let me steal the china.

434
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:39,538
All right. Because in eight months,
when this is all over,

435
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,209
and they need new history books to cover
what we've accomplished here,

436
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,170
each and every single one of you
will be able to say that

437
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,092
"I did the hardest thing
that has ever been done." Yeah?

438
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,134
Yeah!

439
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,053
Let's do it.
- Let's get to it!

440
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,852
- Beautiful. Perfect.
Thank you.

441
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,771
- Yeah.
- Sir,

442
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,983
you said to tell you when the new lady
did anything you wouldn't like.

443
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,777
{\an8}<i>I'm here at the Kennedy Space Center</i>

444
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,988
{\an8}<i>with Deputy Launch Director, Henry Smalls.</i>

445
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,907
What's going on? That's my name.
He's got my name and my job!

446
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,077
{\an8}<i>It's been a great time for all of us.
You know, for me, this is very personal.</i>

447
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,412
{\an8}<i>My father was an airman...</i>

448
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,496
Who is that?

449
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,873
- It's not me.
- <i>...he died in the line of duty</i>

450
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,834
{\an8}- <i>when I was a child...</i>
- I'm not that handsome.

451
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,002
{\an8}<i>...so this is for you, Dad.</i>

452
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,878
- Oh, that's it.
- <i>So sorry to hear that.</i>

453
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,548
- <i>Thanks for sharing. That must've been...</i>
- My dad's still alive.

454
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,679
Right. What is it that we can do
to sort of make 6:00 p.m.? Yeah.

455
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,682
NASA Public Affairs, this is Kelly Jones.

456
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,143
Kelly, ABC wants next week's press reel.

457
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,395
They also want the best photo we have
from the Apollo 8.

458
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,897
Tell them they can have it
if they give us their 6:00 p.m. time slot.

459
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,442
- Got it.
- If you air an animated segment,

460
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,736
- I can offer you an exclusive--
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

461
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:54,530
<i>Your father was a hero. You are a hero.
We so appreciate you working at...</i>

462
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,408
- That was the head of NBC News.
- Yeah, I don't care. Who is that?

463
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,535
{\an8}<i>Thank you. See you on the moon.</i>

464
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,579
{\an8}To the world, that's Henry Smalls.

465
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,788
That's not Henry Smalls.

466
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,832
No, but you told me
that your guys don't do interviews,

467
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,167
so I had to hire new guys.

468
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,797
You have two of the best engineers
on the planet installing a window.

469
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,467
Phil, if you hammer one more time, I swear
to God I'm gonna lose my mind.

470
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,427
Put down the hammer,
take your stupid belts off

471
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:17,636
and get back to testing.

472
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:20,681
On the move. Here we go.

473
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,266
Can you believe that view?

474
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,643
- We got the first photos from Apollo 8.
- It's better than mine.

475
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,562
The first shot of the earth from the moon.

476
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,981
Isn't that the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

477
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,109
- How'd you get this before me?
- They're calling it "Earthrise."

478
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,236
It's going to be at the top
of every news segment tonight.

479
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,988
I mean, '68 has been such a terrible year.

480
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:39,158
Assassinations, this heinous war,
we've seen the worst of humanity.

481
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,411
Now NASA gives us this?
A whole new way to see the world.

482
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,374
And I'm gonna make sure everybody sees it.

483
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,212
You can't just fake people!

484
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,006
- Hey, I'm here for the casting.
- Oh!

485
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,886
- Who's he?
- You. You're a juicy part.

486
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,263
So, here's the scenes
and the character bio.

487
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,766
This is the man that you're playing,
so you wanna up the charisma a bit.

488
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,142
- Can do. I'll up the--
- Okay? Okay.

489
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,520
- Sixty missions in Korea?
- Yeah.

490
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,773
It's an honor.
- I flew 52 missions in Korea.

491
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:11,857
I rounded up.

492
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:17,029
"I flew 52 missions in Korea."
How was that?

493
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,740
- What?
- I'll work on it.

494
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,246
She has a fake me now.

495
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:28,082
- She got a fake me.
- She got a fake me and a fake you.

496
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,708
- You can't fake me and you.
- There's nothing here.

497
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,670
There's no Moe Berkus.
I checked every spelling.

498
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,339
I have a Moe Berkus on the line.

499
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,220
- Do you want me to talk?
- Oh, no, no. I'm gonna enjoy this.

500
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,889
This is gonna be the fastest firing
in NASA's history.

501
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,268
- Hey, Moe.
- Cole, I hear you're looking for me.

502
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,688
I am. Kelly Jones hired actors
to play NASA engineers.

503
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,108
It is unacceptable.
I want her desk cleared today.

504
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:57,278
Calm, calm, calm down, okay?

505
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,323
Washington watches TV.
Apollo is now on TV.

506
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,576
Every channel, every day.

507
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,246
So, you want to get to the moon?

508
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,540
<i>I suggest, focus on your job.</i>

509
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,916
<i>Let Kelly do hers.</i>

510
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,003
If she's made you the belle of the ball,

511
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:18,382
why don't you just slip on your tutu
and do some dancing?

512
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,683
- She fired?
- Mm-mmm.

513
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,562
Are we fired?

514
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,360
<i>Apollo 8, carrying astronauts
Borman, Lovell and Anders</i>

515
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,821
<i>was launched into space by a Saturn V.</i>

516
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,575
Every single network is airing
the Earthrise shot.

517
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,535
I mean, it's-- it's gonna be everywhere.

518
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,455
You know, I tried
a little something on it,

519
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,374
- but I just don't think it's working yet.
- It's not enough. We need a hook,

520
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,044
a way to weave the moon landing
into people's everyday lives

521
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,545
without them realizing it.

522
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,632
Uh, hi. Do you have anything
close to a salad?

523
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,258
Pickles come on a burger.

524
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,845
It's gonna be a minute, though.
Apollo news has business picking up.

525
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,723
All the tourists love to come in
and see little pieces of history.

526
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:11,393
- Pieces of history?
- Yeah, like-- like that pen.

527
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,605
John Glenn ate here every night in '61.

528
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,358
He would work on his flight manuals,
and he'd use one of our pens.

529
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,777
That one ended up on Mercury 6.

530
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:23,280
You're at the only restaurant in the world
whose name's been in space.

531
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,408
That's cool.

532
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,166
And right up ahead,

533
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,919
it's the famous Mercury rockets.

534
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,922
Be sure to get a picture here,
but don't stand too close.

535
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,340
They might go off.

536
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,678
He recovered after that weekend.

537
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,476
Does it bother you that a room dies
every time you walk into it?

538
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,228
You're supposed to stay on your side.

539
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,021
- I missed you.
- Hmm.

540
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,773
I'd like you to approve
our new ad campaigns.

541
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,692
Why don't you just sidestep me
like you did last time?

542
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,695
I wanna apologize for blindsiding you
with the interviews.

543
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,405
I have a fix for our money problems.

544
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:09,201
Well, your apology is rejected,
and so is whatever this is.

545
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,663
- Omega.
- Look, this isn't Madison Avenue.

546
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,832
- We don't pay for this stuff.
- No, it's cost-free.

547
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,792
The brands get a tie-in money can't buy,

548
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,670
and NASA works its way
into the minds of everyday people.

549
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,172
A watch ad? That's-That's your big idea?

550
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,717
Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:25,801
Toothpaste.

552
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,348
Tang. "The energy breakfast drink
chosen for Apollo astronauts

553
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,642
- on their trip to the moon."
- Moon coupons?

554
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,645
But, my personal favorite,

555
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,732
Fruit of the Loom. Right?

556
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,276
The guys gotta wear something
under those big suits, don't they?

557
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,944
Nothing says NASA like Fruit of the Loom.

558
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,448
Look, I am not turning this ship
into a flying billboard

559
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,366
no matter how much you want it to happen.

560
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,119
And by the way, we don't have time
to test all this before liftoff.

561
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,705
We don't have to send any of this up
into space as long as we say it went.

562
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,123
Oh, so you're gonna lie?

563
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,083
It's called selling.
We're not lying to the customer.

564
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,294
- We're changing the way they think.
- No, it's called lying.

565
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,213
Everyone is just a customer to you, huh?

566
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,759
Look, I know that you're a big old fancy
ad shark and everything,

567
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,970
but NASA's not something that you sell
with a jingle and a slogan.

568
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,389
You do not know who we are.

569
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,933
Yeah, okay. Who's Margaret Hamilton?

570
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,977
- Who?
- She works here for you.

571
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,396
There are 400,000 people
that are affiliated

572
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,899
- with this space program, Ms. Jones.
- She's one of your engineers.

573
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,109
- Who's JoAnn Morgan?
- She works in the firing room.

574
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,154
Did you ever ask her why she took this job
in the first place? I have.

575
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,324
She says it's because she has rocket fuel
in her blood.

576
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,493
And NASA's not just a logo, it's people.

577
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,994
People who wake up every morning

578
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,580
and commit to accomplishing
the impossible.

579
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,583
And all while wearing the same underwear
as the rest of us.

580
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,170
Ella, can I help you with anything at all?

581
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,254
Mm-mmm.

582
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,053
Thank you.

583
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,307
So I ran the projections,
and this is what you stand to make

584
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,184
if you accept key sponsorships.

585
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,481
We-We can't take private money.

586
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,358
It doesn't matter, okay?

587
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,151
I'm about to make NASA so popular

588
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,987
that Congress will finally
turn the taps back on around here.

589
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,616
And all I have to do is just let Armstrong
put on an Omega watch?

590
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,160
No. If we get the money flowing,

591
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,663
then you've gotta prove to me

592
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,957
that Cocoa Beach has a decent place
to get dinner.

593
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,586
Um...

594
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,007
- Deal. I--
- Yes! Deal! Yes! Whoo!

595
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:33,721
Uh, no, wait. I'm drawing the line
at toilet paper though,

596
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:36,682
because the world does not get to know
what our guys wipe their ass with.

597
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,559
Well, shit.

598
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,441
Would you like to go for
a vacation when you come back to earth?

599
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:48,110
The situation being what it is now,

600
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,529
the place I would most like to go, uh--

601
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,031
Lose the table next time, Walter.

602
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,784
Neil looks like he's giving
GE's quarterly profit report.

603
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,536
That's always been our table--

604
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,413
TV brings them in
to people's living rooms.

605
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,998
They should look like they belong there.

606
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:03,500
- It'd mean that we succeeded.

607
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,670
You're still in charge, Walter.
Don't you worry.

608
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,714
When I'm done helping though,

609
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,841
those men are gonna be
bigger than The Beatles.

610
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:14,470
I'm getting to go 99.9% of the way there,
and that suits me just fine.

611
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:29,985
- What's the name of that VP at Kellogg's?
- I believe it's Harrison Driscoll.

612
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:31,737
All right, Harrison.

613
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:36,283
So instead of "Snap, Crackle, Pop,"
"Neil, Buzz and Mike." It's cute, right?

614
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,581
Cole!

615
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,920
- Make sure that doesn't rust, Henry.
- Can you mark these?

616
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,259
Hey, hey.
- Did you see that?

617
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,427
You didn't see the cat?

618
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,932
Go closer on the Tang bottle.

619
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,935
Make the font bigger
and put bacon with the eggs.

620
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,354
Let's not forget,
we're selling America, here.

621
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,317
{\an8}"Peter Pan Peanut Butter. Peanut butter
that's out-of-this-world smooth."

622
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,695
"Hasselblad.
See the world the way they do."

623
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,781
Larry, this is Omega's big chance.

624
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,659
On the back of every Speedmaster
till the end of time,

625
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,372
"The first watch worn on the moon." Right?

626
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,998
Now we just gotta stand her up.

627
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,292
It's all gonna be worth it.

628
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:39,471
- Hey. Hey! You're in my spot.
- We're setting up a shot for Kelly.

629
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,069
We've got three astronauts
on the Apollo 11 mission.

630
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,739
There they are in front of
three beautiful American cars.

631
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,991
Oh, this is great.

632
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,534
You gotta be
in the test facility right now.

633
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,493
Talk to Kelly.

634
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,370
Kelly said we could
take a Corvette home for a dollar.

635
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,413
- There you are.
- A dollar?

636
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,164
I'm gonna need them
for 15 minutes, but that's all.

637
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,250
I needed them 15 minutes ago, Kelly.

638
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,502
You know how expensive
those suits are?

639
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:14,923
Oh, don't worry.
It's just the launch director.

640
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,968
<i>This strange looking bird,
the LEM, Mr. Kelly. How does it work?</i>

641
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,262
<i>Well, this is a spacecraft that's used</i>

642
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,222
<i>to take men down to the lunar surface.</i>

643
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,726
<i>And two of the three astronauts
in the LEM...</i>

644
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,483
Flight, we missed target
and are drifting into the vast abyss.

645
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:39,031
- And we're dead. Again.
Yeah.

646
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,199
Ran out of fuel 30 seconds
before touchdown.

647
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,492
Yeah, but the landing, though,

648
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,411
- it was smooth-- It was good.
- Great pitch. Forward.

649
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,871
You're both bad liars.

650
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,458
Neil, Mike, Buzz, if I can get
one more photo for Ms. Jones and Omega?

651
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,542
Who are you, man?

652
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,839
- All right, watches up, boys.

653
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,716
And smile for Omega.

654
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,476
- Davis.
- Am I interrupting?

655
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,772
- Always.
- There should be a box in front of you.

656
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:13,607
- <i>Why don't you open it?</i>

657
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,113
Omega thanks you for your service.

658
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,866
<i>Your boys are all over TV,</i>

659
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:28,872
the taps are flowing again. So... dinner?

660
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,835
Yeah. Canaveral Pier. Five o'clock.

661
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,420
Wear your watch.

662
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,342
3:00 p.m. is their best
and final time slot to air the interview.

663
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:43,679
For an exclusive with Armstrong?
3:00 p.m. is for children and deadbeats.

664
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,181
They said they have breaking news
from the war.

665
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,227
<i>Unknown size enemy force.</i>

666
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,604
<i>Enemy casualties are unknown,</i>

667
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,314
<i>but you've seen how it really was.</i>

668
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,441
So much for keeping Apollo back
in the news cycle.

669
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,902
<i>Heroism, danger, fear,
all rolled into one.</i>

670
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,654
<i>Words don't describe it.</i>

671
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:04,074
<i>Richard Threlkeld, CBS News.
Near the Cambodian border.</i>

672
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,288
Thank you, Captain Scotty. Appreciate you.

673
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,290
Okay.

674
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,209
Well, you spare no expense on a lady.

675
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,627
Just try it.

676
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,087
Shrimp, mayo, bun.

677
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,840
And that happens to be the best meal
in a hundred miles.

678
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,470
- Mmm.
- Told you.

679
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,724
How'd I not know about this place?

680
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,767
Not everybody likes to advertise.

681
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,145
Nice one. That's good.

682
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,194
That's where the rocket will launch
out of. Right there.

683
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,785
That watch looks great on you.
You wear it very well.

684
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,165
Thanks.

685
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,838
That night at the bar,
what I said to you--

686
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,465
That you couldn't take your eyes off me,

687
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,842
and I was the most beautiful woman
that you'd ever seen?

688
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,178
Y-Yeah, that part. That-- Yes. Mm-hmm.

689
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,472
It was impulsive.

690
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:11,433
It was meant for a stranger,
and we're working together now.

691
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,852
So, I just don't want you
to think that I was--

692
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,936
Interested?

693
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,648
I just wanted to clear the air.

694
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,151
Oh. Well, the air was clear.

695
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:22,819
Good.

696
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,119
I had a thought.

697
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,080
Yeah.
It was perfect for 30 seconds.

698
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,248
What are the networks covering
night and day?

699
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,334
You think I have time to watch TV?

700
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:41,171
Vietnam. They're broadcasting
straight from the action.

701
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,006
And people don't want
to just hear the news anymore.

702
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,966
They wanna see it in the making.

703
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:46,635
Okay.

704
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,269
{\an8}- Why not let 'em?

705
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,772
Oh, you want to put
a live television camera on the LEM?

706
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,023
Yes.

707
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,650
My guys are trying to survive up there.

708
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,610
They don't have time to figure out
how to film a movie.

709
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,113
We'll figure it out for 'em.
All they have to do is point and shoot.

710
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:08,490
You don't get it.
It's a logistical nightmare.

711
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,243
There's power issues, storage, weight.

712
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,161
There's not even a camera
that would work up there

713
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,665
'cause it's negative 200 degrees at night
and over 250 degrees during the daytime.

714
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,792
Can you imagine seeing it?

715
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,962
No. I just said it's impossible.

716
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,713
- Yes. That's the point.
- Mmm.

717
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,799
It would be
the greatest televised event ever.

718
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,467
Do you think this is a game show?

719
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,803
There is a very good reason

720
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:32,639
why the Soviets aren't broadcasting
their space walks.

721
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,683
Because they're
a tight-lipped dictatorship.

722
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:35,976
- Yeah, that's not us.
- Wow.

723
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,019
When we succeed, we do it as a nation.

724
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,397
- And when we fail, we grieve as a nation.
- Right.

725
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,190
That's what it means to be American.

726
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,734
Oh, stop telling me what it means
to be an American.

727
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,904
There's only one of us here that has
served their country their entire life.

728
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:53,785
I'm sorry. We're not putting
the camera on the LEM.

729
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,834
I mean it. We're not.

730
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,045
We are.

731
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,470
There's no way he can do it
without more fuel.

732
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,185
- Have him run it again.
- Yeah.

733
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,277
Okay. [sighs] I'm on a tight schedule.
What is it?

734
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:31,239
Kelly briefed me on the camera idea,
and we like it.

735
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,200
We like it a lot.

736
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,493
- She misspoke. We can't do it.

737
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,496
There is no such technology
that even exists.

738
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,081
Actually it does. You know?

739
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,877
The Department of Defense designed this

740
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:47,297
to find downed fighter pilots
in Vietnam at night.

741
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:51,927
Now, it's classified
but the DOD is going to let you use it

742
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,762
as long as nobody knows what it is.

743
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,931
There's absolutely no space
for equipment that heavy.

744
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,682
We are weighing screws for God's sake.

745
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,559
What-- I mean, what is this, 15 pounds?

746
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,436
Okay. So, just, like, lighter screws.

747
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,355
We're trying for another fuel cell.

748
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:08,151
So our men, when they get to the moon,
they still have enough fuel to lift off.

749
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,279
Out of all her bad ideas,
this one is the worst.

750
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,824
Actually, the president loves it.

751
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,410
So, now it's a great idea.

752
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,121
So, let me put it to you simply, Cole.

753
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,874
Find a way to put this on that.

754
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,794
This is an order. From the tippy top.

755
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,016
Don, Stu. Can you come in here, please?

756
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,523
Thank you. Let's not make
everything so hard.

757
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,153
Please help Miss Jones strip
this top secret camera down.

758
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,322
I don't want 'em to know it's top secret.

759
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,407
Well, now they do.

760
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,242
Please strip this top secret camera.

761
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,078
Mount it onto the LEM
for live broadcasting.

762
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,332
Cole. One last thing.

763
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:09,296
Last week, a CIA spy plane took
some surveillance photographs

764
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,090
of the new Russian N1 rocket.

765
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,800
And Congress saw it,

766
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,678
and some of the members
are having cold feet

767
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,347
- about the final round of funding.

768
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,266
We're months away from winning this thing.

769
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,018
I'm gonna send them down here,

770
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:25,228
and you're gonna convince them
to sit tight.

771
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,189
No. I'm-- I'm gonna write up
some talking points.

772
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,274
Huh.

773
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,743
Don't take it personally.

774
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:43,288
Pilots fight gravity.
It's part of their nature.

775
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:06,436
Henry?

776
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,647
Oh.

777
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,651
Well, I'm-- I'm glad you're not Cole.

778
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,736
- Oh?
- Yeah.

779
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,905
- He don't like me smoking.

780
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,907
What, are you worried
he's gonna ground you?

781
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:26,247
Uh, no. I, uh...
I had emergency bypass surgery last year.

782
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,793
Yeah. That son of a bitch.
He's hell-bent on keeping me alive.

783
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:31,503
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

784
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,421
Yeah. Nobody here does.

785
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,714
Just Cole.

786
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:40,095
Yeah. He came to the hospital
and held my wife's hand for three days.

787
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,808
Yeah. It's a long way from the day we met.

788
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,854
Kid had just got back from Korea.

789
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,233
The top pilot in the Air Force.

790
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,486
Silver Star. Flying Cross.

791
00:44:57,654 --> 00:45:01,282
He was first in line at Edwards
when they were looking for astronauts.

792
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:04,953
But, uh, he ended up not making the cut.

793
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:10,458
So, what got him? It was his temper.

794
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:14,462
No, no. His heart.

795
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,839
Doc found an A-fib.

796
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,135
A little thing but enough to keep him
out of the program.

797
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,639
Cole Davis is the best pilot
who will never get to space.

798
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:43,283
You know, I've been looking at this view
every day for the last 15 years.

799
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:48,121
But lately, it's like
I'm seeing it for the first time.

800
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:54,627
Apollo 1 cast a big shadow on this place.

801
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,675
It's nice to have some light back.

802
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,263
Okay.

803
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,145
Hey, I keep seeing Cole drive out there
every night.

804
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:15,565
What's he doing?

805
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:20,570
Gardening.

806
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,236
You ready?
- Yeah.

807
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,870
All right. Look, we just--
We give the senator a tour.

808
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,332
We play nice for 30 minutes.
We keep the lights on.

809
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,543
Okay. Fine.

810
00:47:58,543 --> 00:47:59,794
Oh.

811
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,588
What?
She's just there.

812
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,755
- Don't run.
- No, no.

813
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,716
- Just don't run. Don't--
- Wait. [shushing] Shut up.

814
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,759
No. See, you scared it.

815
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:07,844
I just ate.

816
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:16,102
Henry, come on! Come on!

817
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:22,650
I hate that cat.

818
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,069
I see what y-- you mean.

819
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:28,615
- That's an asshole cat.
- Did you see the look it gave me?

820
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:30,283
- It's just taunting me now.

821
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,828
- What is that?
That's cat food.

822
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,080
- Somebody's feeding that thing.
- Who's doing that?

823
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,958
Find them. [pants] Find them immediately,
and fire them immediately.

824
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,544
Mr. Davis. Sir, uh, Senator Hopp is here.

825
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,254
All right. What? You look fine.

826
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,339
Senator.

827
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,716
- Hello, Mr. Davis.
Senator. What an honor.

828
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:49,510
It's an honor and a pleasure.
- Very nice to see you.

829
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:54,349
Well, the Apollo 11 capsule
has arrived,

830
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:57,810
and next week, we will be attaching it
to the Saturn V rocket.

831
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,064
And that gets us off the ground
and out of Earth's atmosphere.

832
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:05,818
Well, that's all very impressive,
but I have to be up-front.

833
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:09,113
Georgia had some devastating floods
this year.

834
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:12,450
And I'm voting to put this money
toward our relief fund.

835
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,369
That seems a little selfish,
don't you think?

836
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,954
- Excuse me?
- Uh, that's a figure of speech.

837
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,582
- Here's what he means.
- My voters mostly think

838
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,210
we are overspending on the moon.

839
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,836
That's funny, because--
Yoo-hoo!

840
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,922
Excuse me. Senator Hopp.

841
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:28,341
Oh, you probably don't remember me,

842
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:31,511
but you spoke
at my sophomore year of college.

843
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,680
Georgia Tech. '55.

844
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,931
You're a Buzz?

845
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:37,058
Yes, sir.
- Of course I remember.

846
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,268
Your words inspired me that day.

847
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:43,189
You said, "Commitment means
staying loyal to a cause."

848
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:46,859
Two years later, I graduated with honors.
Now I run this department.

849
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:50,113
You know, in '62, you said
that you would fight

850
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:53,157
for Kennedy's dream no matter what.

851
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,202
I know that the moon mission
was more popular back then,

852
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:59,414
but it would be just a shame

853
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:03,918
if the man whose words inspired me
to work at NASA

854
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,754
didn't live by those very same words.

855
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:12,844
- It would be a shame, wouldn't it?
- Sir, you are just such a wonderful man.

856
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:14,011
- Thank you so much.
- Mmm.

857
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,388
You are a wonderful man.

858
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,473
Isn't she just
a wonderful Georgia peach here?

859
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,558
- Oh, my.
- Oh. Yes.

860
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:20,727
- You are so sweet.
- Yes, I am.

861
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:24,731
Let me take you on the special VIP tour
they didn't tell you about.

862
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,691
- Oh, I'd love that.
Wonderful.

863
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,693
Do you go on this tour with me?

864
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,236
I absolutely will.

865
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,863
That's so sweet.

866
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:33,781
She teared up. I mean, it's scary.

867
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,617
Wave and smile.

868
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:38,953
Bye-bye!

869
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,376
<i>The space program is not only
a bloated mess,</i>

870
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:49,380
{\an8}<i>but Apollo flies in the face
of our creator</i>

871
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,593
{\an8}<i>and the true father of this country.
I would remind you that we don't--</i>

872
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:58,556
We landed Hopp. We need two more votes.
Looks like it's not gonna be Vanning.

873
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,185
- Definitely not Vanning.
- Next, we have Senator Cook.

874
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:04,020
Cook's a little scary. I'm not gonna lie.

875
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,897
He's a Cold War conservative.

876
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:10,693
He's worried that our budget takes away
from weapons development at the DOD.

877
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,280
Now, Senator, with the N1 rocket,

878
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,699
the Russians still could land on the moon
before us.

879
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,743
What we're about to show you
is our most recent intel

880
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,745
on what they plan to build if they do.

881
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,294
- And these are photos?
No, sir.

882
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,380
Those are, uh, renderings
of a possible future.

883
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,924
Future photos?

884
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,136
Is that a laser?

885
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,013
It's going towards Earth, sir.

886
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,850
- What are they calling it?
-"Killer Lunar Laser Eliminator," sir.

887
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,978
-"Killer Lunar Laser Eliminator"?
Yes, sir.

888
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:48,689
Damn it. That's good.

889
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:51,150
And, finally, we have Senator Hedges.

890
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,402
Now, he's always been a fan of Apollo,

891
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:57,073
but he's getting pressure
from his state party not to fund.

892
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,326
He can't take in oxygen
without a camera pointed at him,

893
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:03,246
and we're about to have
a few of those around here.

894
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:04,997
Any questions?

895
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,082
No, ma'am.

896
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,334
Well, let's get him then.

897
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,672
- Hello, everyone!

898
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,301
Gentlemen.

899
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,596
It's-- It's-- It's great
to be back, everyone.

900
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,808
You know how much I love
the Apollo program.

901
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,690
Senator. Apollo 10 will just be
orbiting the moon.

902
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:34,318
But it's gonna get us information critical
for the touchdown of 11.

903
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,571
- Like landing conditions and location.
- Amazing.

904
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:39,073
And we've a special seat for you here,
Senator, amongst your fans.

905
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,449
- For me? Oh. Thank you.

906
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,952
<i>Apollo launch control,</i>

907
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,704
<i>and we are go on the countdown</i>

908
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:47,874
<i>for the Apollo 10 lunar mission
at this time.</i>

909
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,379
We have ignition sequence start.

910
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,258
Five, four, three, two...

911
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,177
All engines running.

912
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,605
Liftoff. We have liftoff.

913
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,732
Forty-nine minutes past the hour.

914
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,318
Tower clear. Tower clear.

915
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,194
Houston, she's all yours.

916
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:45,431
Glorious launch. Can't wait to be
right back here for Apollo 11.

917
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,017
We cannot thank you enough
for your support, Senator.

918
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:50,353
It's gonna cost you
more than a pair of binoculars.

919
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,898
I owe a favor
to the news fellas back home.

920
00:53:54,607 --> 00:53:57,610
I'd like you to give them
an on-camera interview.

921
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,988
Uh, Senator, I'm the very last person
that you want in front of a camera.

922
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,074
Uh, I d-- I don't do interviews.

923
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:06,369
Except for you, Senator Hedges.
We would be delighted.

924
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,621
Smart lady.

925
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,582
- Good night.
- Good night.

926
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:15,628
Kelly?

927
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,713
It's okay.

928
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,591
- Got it all under control.
- Mm-hmm.

You're entitled to a night off too,
you know.

936
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,293
If I am, it's to sleep.

937
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,421
Oh, you actually have a house?

938
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:00,131
I thought you slept at the office.

939
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:04,218
Well, yeah. Usually. But, uh... Well,
I mean, sometimes I sleep with Jenny.

940
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:08,014
Oh, yeah. Right. Oh. I'm sure she's great.

941
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:10,725
Jenny? Yeah. She-- She is.

942
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:15,146

- Kelly, meet Jenny.

948
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,208
She's just like the one I flew in the war.

949
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:40,171
Keep her here so I can get my flight hours
on the weekends. Saves time.

950
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:41,255
Oh.

951
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,258
She's quite a lady.

952
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,802
Yeah. She is.

953
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:51,557
- Wanna go up?
- No.

954
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:52,641

- Yeah.

955
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:55,394
Okay. Come on.

956
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:57,772

960
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:16,957
We call them the seas.

961
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,960
The gravity is stronger in the seas, so...

962
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,589
We've looked to land in, uh, pretty much
every single one of them.

963
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,674
You got the Sea of Serenity.

964
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:28,803
Sea of Crises. We crossed that one
off the list pretty quick.

965
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:30,513
- Yeah. That's bad PR.

966
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:34,642
And then we finally settled on,
uh, the Sea of Tranquility.

967
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:36,060
That's the sweet spot.

968
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:42,733
You know, come to think about it,
I-- I know a lot more about the moon

969
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,111
than I know about you by a long shot.

970
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,239
I don't even know where you're from.

971
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:51,617
Kansas.

972
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,287
Kelly from Kansas.

973
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,749
How'd you get into advertising,
Kelly from Kansas?

974
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:06,257
Uh, well, I was four when my dad left,
and my mom lost the house.

975
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:07,508
We lived in a car.

976
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:11,262
And...
...a church gave her a job

977
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:12,888
selling cookie tins.

978
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:19,061
So, she had this idea that we'd sell more
if it was me going door-to-door.

979
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,230
- Oh, yeah. Smart lady.

980
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:27,695
Cookie tins, then it was vacuums,
then beauty goods when I got older.

981
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:30,865
Yeah. Traveling the country,
me and my mom.

982
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:33,242
It's how we got back on our feet.

983
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,746
Well, I'm sorry you went through that.

984
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,335
Well, don't be. I...

985
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,506
Yeah. I learned early on how to survive.

986
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:54,138
Plus, we all have our share
of tough breaks.

987
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:01,228
Henry told me about the A-fib
and you getting kicked out of the program.

988
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:05,107
Hmm. I'm gonna have to have
a little conversation with Henry.

989
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,281
You know, I don't totally agree
with you though.

990
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:18,245
- How's that?
Well, I just don't--

991
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:22,208
I don't think that our sad stories
are supposed to

992
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,918
teach us how to survive the world.

993
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,671
I think they're supposed to
make us wanna change it.

994
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:31,008
- Hmm.
Cole!

995
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,303
Buzz is trying to hot-wire your Camaro!

996
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,847
- Come on, man.

997
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:38,807
Well...

998
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:41,268
You better go stop him.

999
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:44,230
Yeah.

1000
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,546
Jesus!

1001
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,173
- We need to talk.

1002
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:18,097
You have done outstanding work, Kel.

1003
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,474
Public interest is way up.

1004
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:25,271
You landed the senators
and secured the launch.

1005
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:27,982
And that's why you
broke into my motel room?

1006
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:29,233
As a thank-you?

1007
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,652
Now that we know
the whole world will be watching,

1008
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,779
we can't afford to lose.

1009
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:40,160
We need to be prepared
to present an alternate version

1010
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,704
of the moon landing.

1011
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,123
An alternate version?

1012
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:47,501
The... Artemis version.

1013
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:53,007
She was the twin sister of Apollo,
uh, you know, the backup.

1014
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:57,511
So we just need to be ready
to shoot a little picture.

1015
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:02,141
Something showing us, you know,
up there walking around,

1016
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,934
waving at the camera.

1017
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:07,146
- You mean, to fake it?
- All goes well, we never use it.

1018
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,356
But if not...

1019
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:12,526
Hmm.

1020
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,488
You know why I never went to prison?

1021
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:20,200
Probably, but humor me.

1022
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,785
'Cause I quit while I'm ahead.

1023
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,872
Can't keep a secret this big.
Thousands of people work here.

1024
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:31,837
Well, thousands of people work
at a classified location in the desert

1025
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:35,966
that experiments
on a fleet of extraterrestrial pods

1026
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,427
that we found at the bottom of the ocean.

1027
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,096
And you never heard about that, did ya?

1028
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:44,058
Come on, that's not true.

1029
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:48,270
Uh, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

1030
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,106
But the one thing you can be sure of

1031
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:57,196
is that the world will watch Americans
plant an American flag on the moon.

1032
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:01,158
And you are telling me
that President Nixon supports this?

1033
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:04,495
He probably would.
He doesn't know about it

1034
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:10,793
in the same way that Cole Davis
will never know about it.

1035
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,586
And that shouldn't be a problem

1036
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:16,256
considering what else
you haven't shared with him

1037
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:18,926
while you've grown closer.

1038
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,554
I mean, what would a clean-cut
guy like that think about--

1039
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,847
You made your point.

1040
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:27,184
No one can outrun their past.

1041
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:31,146
But I can make it go away. Forever.

1042
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:32,981
No more running.

1043
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,615
I'm gonna need my assistant.

1044
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:45,285
Of course.

1045
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:49,206
And we'll get you a team of secure agents.

1046
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:54,795
Now, who's the best director you've got
that no one's ever heard of?

1047
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:00,342
You're gonna love him.

1048
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,555
This is the most remote
hangar on the base.

1049
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:07,224
No one can go in or out
without my permission.

1050
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,726
Wait, no one? Not even Cole?

1051
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:12,354
Especially not Cole.

1052
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,068
Unbelievable, Kelly.

1053
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,446
You have me...
...forced onto a plane,

1054
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,197
and brought to godforsaken Florida!

1055
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,740
Do you mind?

1056
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,368
I'm a member of the DGA.

1057
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,787
I will not be treated this way.

1058
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:31,748
- I am calling my agent.
- You can't.

1059
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,833
Watch me.

1060
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:36,211
Remember we talked about this.
This is a high-security government job.

1061
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:39,381
- I'm doubling your quote.
- Okay.

1062
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,549
- With a bonus.
- Mmm.

1063
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:45,387
Yes. The only caveat being that
no one can ever know what we're doing.

1064
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,556
- I cannot accept that.
- They will shoot you.

1065
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,349
What is my budget?

1066
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:55,105
Your budget is whatever it costs
to turn this into the moon

1067
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,690
for two-and-a-half hours.

1068
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,609
It's shorter than <i>Ben-Hur</i>.

1069
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,611
<i>♪ I can't tell you ♪</i>

1070
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:02,070
<i>♪ Who to sock it to ♪</i>

1071
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,239
<i>♪ It's your thing ♪</i>

1072
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,325
<i>♪ Baby, do what you wanna do ♪</i>

1073
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,953

01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,039
<i>♪ Who to sock it to ♪</i>

1075
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,668
I will need a fridge
full of Tab over there.

1076
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:21,590
And an army of minions
who don't ask questions.

1077
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,343
<i>♪ It's your thing, now ♪</i>

1078
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:26,303

1080
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,183
<i>♪ Who to sock it to ♪</i>

1081
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:35,687
Kelly, these aren't real actors.

1082
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,898
- Well, this is the best you're gonna get.

1083
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,858
Neil's 5'11". Anybody 5'11"?

1084
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,277
Okay. The rest of you are dismissed.

1085
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,321
- Take your pick.
- Mmm. Hold on. You.

1086
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,656
You're gonna be my personal assistant.

1087
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:48,033
I'll just call you Joseph
so you can't take things personally.

1088
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,326
Go stand somewhere.

1089
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,620
All right. Can we
take these sunglasses off, please,

1090
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,581
so I can see your eyes
and believe your truth?

1091
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,375
Now, I want each of you to do a monologue.

1092
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:59,586
Preferably something classical,
and by God,

1093
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,213
don't make me watch seven Hamlets.

1094
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,298
You're not gonna see their faces.
They're wearing helmets.

1095
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:04,967
Wh--

1096
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,555
All right, how do I convey

1097
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:12,182
the gripping fear
of being on the moon for the first time

1098
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,351
if we can't show a human face?

1099
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,144
Acting is a sport, Kelly.

1100
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,480
- It is energy, body, bu--
Where do I set up?

1101
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:20,649
- Edvard?
- Ah.

1102
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,735
- How did you get in here?
- I just walked through the door.

1103
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:28,657
What part of "talking about this is gonna
get us killed" do you not understand?

1104
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:31,285
- And he's the slowest DP in New York.
- I pick the cinematographer.

1105
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:33,662
- It's in my contract.
- What? You don't have a contract.

1106
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,414
He's the best, and all DPs are slow.

1107
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:39,293
What we need to have
a serious conversation about, Kelly,

1108
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,587
is production design, hmm?

1109
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:44,798
What materials are we using
to recreate the lunar surface?

1110
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,383
It's just a big rock, right?

1111
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:56,602
I can't work like this, Kelly.

1112
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,980
You know this about me. Hmm?

1113
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,607
I need details.

1114
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:04,109
We need details. Specifics.

1115
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:08,322
Is it dusty, rocky, windy?
What is the light source? Hmm?

1116
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:12,284
- It's the sun. Big light.
- Do not smart-mouth me, Edvard.

1117
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:16,079
And what is the sun's position
in relation to the landing area?

1118
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,165
And are we building a replica?
Do we have a plan?

1119
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:21,710
Do we have suits,
and how do people move in those suits?

1120
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,254
And what, Kelly,
does space even look like?

1121
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,256
You know, I gotta--
I gotta lie down.

1122
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,800
Where is my trailer?

1123
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:34,681
We need to find a way to copy everything
in that simulation room.

1124
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,308
- Okay.
- ASAP.

1125
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,393
Wait a second. Do I even have a trailer?

1126
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,521
Your silence tells me what I already know.

1127
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,565
You haven't thought about
how to recreate the moon,

1128
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,610
- why would you think about a trailer?
- I think we should've gotten Kubrick.

1129
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,487
We've got to get
this new ship right.

1130
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,238
I mean, Armstrong, he was pissed off

1131
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,782
- and we can't have that again.
- Sorry.

1132
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:54,409
Buddy, buddy.

1133
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,453
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is sensitive material.

1134
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,372
- Henry. Henry.
- Uh-uh. You can't be here.

1135
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:01,166
These photos are for the archival book
that Penguin is doing.

1136
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,959
- What book?
- Yeah, didn't you get the memo?

1137
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,419
- No.
- What? You're writing the foreword.

1138
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:07,255
- I-- I'm writing the foreword?
- Yeah, absolutely.

1139
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,799
- Me?
- Yes, of course.

1140
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,176
- I've never written a foreword.
- The editor wants to hear from you.

1141
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,469
- We all do.
- He wants me to write it?

1142
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,805
Don't be so humble, all right?
Let's get a photo of you with the--

1143
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,390
- with the LEM.
- I mean, I can do it, but--

1144
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,599
Say, "we're going to the moon."

1145
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,559
- We're going to the moon.
- There you go!

1146
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:23,438
Aldrin and Armstrong will practice
every single movement that they make,

1147
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,315
um, right here for months.

1148
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,692
- That is incredible.
- Yeah.

1149
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,944
So, this is, like,
the surface of the moon?

1150
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:30,070
- Well, yeah. It's--
- Yeah.

1151
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:31,405
It's our best approximation.

1152
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:34,366
This just looks like a dirty beach.
I don't believe it. No.

1153
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:36,326
- It is-- It's based off sediment we got.
- Joseph.

1154
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:37,244
It's from NASA--

1155
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:40,122
Wait. I do not believe
this is what NASA uses

1156
01:06:40,122 --> 01:06:42,290
to go to the moon.
You cannot tell me-- No.

1157
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:46,378
Want you to walk as if you're
carrying your mother across the desert.

1158
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:49,631
She's frail but also heavy.

1159
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,258
Oh. Whoa. Hey.

1160
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:52,801
- So sorry. Hey. Sorry.
- Oh, no, no. No.

1161
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,594
- This is classified. You're not allow--
- Stu, we're good.

1162
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,430
- Very classified.
- We're good here. This is for the book.

1163
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,556
No, you'll hear about it.

1164
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:58,473
I'm doing the foreword,

1165
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,808
- so you'll hear about it soon.
- Okay.

1166
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:02,644
My Armstrong is a whiny, little bitch.
We have to recast.

1167
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,229
No-- We're not recasting.

1168
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:06,523
All right. Well, mediocre it is.

1169
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,984
Edvard! Where is my sun?

1170
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:10,819
- Nice!

1171
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:12,571
- Very nice.
- A countdown at least.

1172
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,322
Okay. Try it again.

1173
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:15,949
- Gonna try it again.
- Do a three, two, one!

1174
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,033
- Come on! Ah!
- Happy?

1175
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,327
J-- Joseph, bring me my Tab.

1176
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:21,580
You're gonna have to find me
'cause I can't see a thing.

1177
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,707
Come on. How long does it take
to give someone a Tab?

1178
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,292
My hand's right here.

1179
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,294
Uh, this will be great.
You guys should all come around

1180
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,463
- and we'll do a shot for the book.
- Great?

1181
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:32,007
Hey, how about this?
Everybody, "We're going to the moon!"

1182
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:34,968
We're going to the moon!

1183
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:38,013
My eyes might have been closed.
You wanna do one more?

1184
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:43,310
I haven't seen you around lately.

1185
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,353
Well, I can say the same thing about you.

1186
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:49,024
How do you do it on the first try?

1187
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:52,152
It's not rocket science.
Okay. You good?

1188
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:54,738
- About the questions, I--
- Yes.

1189
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:59,034
I went over them. Nothing about Apollo 1.
They promised me. Okay?

1190
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:02,245
You're gonna be great. Okay?

1191
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,497
- Mm-hmm.
- Go on.

1192
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,581
- Okay.
- Go.

1193
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,086
Mr. Davis.
You are what we call "a tough get."

1194
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,171
Ha! No. Thank you.

1195
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:14,466
Is there any legal importance
to what we'll be watching

1196
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:18,094
when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
walk on the lunar surface?

1197
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,140
Will the area they land on be considered
property of the United States?

1198
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,811
We're sending a plaque that says,
"We came in peace for all mankind."

1199
01:08:25,811 --> 01:08:27,395
And that is precisely what we mean.

1200
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,439
What else will NASA leave behind?

1201
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,275
Footprints, an American flag
and 12 bags of feces

1202
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,693
that I was told many times

1203
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,237
- that I should not bring up, but...

1204
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:37,197
Should've put him
in front of a camera sooner.

1205
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,782
You wear an Apollo pin.

1206
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,409
I do. Um,

1207
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,787
the wives of Apollo 1's men,

1208
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:47,082
after we lost them, they gave me this.

1209
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:50,043
You were launch director
on that tragic day.

1210
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,630
What went wrong with Apollo 1?

1211
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:59,886
- In your own words, what happened?

1212
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:02,472
Take me back.

1213
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,813
Okay. Here's some facts for you.

1214
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:10,981
<i>The New York Times</i> reported

1215
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:13,692
there were 20,000 safety reports
filed about that ship.

1216
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:17,362
So many, that Gus Grissom
hung a lemon outside it.

1217
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:22,951
<i>All right, crew.
To be confirmed. Location.</i>

1218
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:23,952
<i>Flame!</i>

1219
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:26,037
<i>We've got a fire in the cockpit.</i>

1220
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:26,955
<i>Let's get out!</i>

1221
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:29,958
Mr. Davis? Did you read those reports?

1222
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:32,043
<i>Pad leader,
get in there and help 'em.</i>

1223
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,504
{\an8}<i>Pad leader, stay on C3.</i>

1224
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:43,013
Mr. Davis?
Did you read those reports?

1225
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:49,436
- Did you read those reports?
- Of course I read the reports.

1226
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,438
I read every single one of them.

1227
01:09:52,147 --> 01:09:55,233
Overpressured oxygen
and a bad wire on a "plugs-out" test.

1228
01:09:56,151 --> 01:10:00,196
I was supposed to catch everything,
and I missed it. And I failed them.

1229
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,033
And I will live with that every single day
for the rest of my life.

1230
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:05,660
Is that the quote that you
were looking for, you piece of shit?

1231
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,204
Get me on the phone with your boss.
Now. Now!

1232
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,375
Oh, uh, wait. W-What are you doing?
We have another 20 minutes.

1233
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,460
Go to hell.

1234
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,421
Don't be angry with me. I'm not the reason
three astronauts are dead.

1235
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:22,969
- Say one more thing about the astronauts.
- Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1236
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,888
Get off me.
Let me hear you say one more thing--

1237
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,681
Let me hear you say
one more thing about them!

1238
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,850
You don't know those men!
You don't talk about those men!

1239
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,644
Get off me! Get off!

1240
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:31,728
Get off!

1241
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,396
Do you understand me?

1242
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:43,448
So, I spoke to the producers,
and they've agreed to seal the film

1243
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:47,160
if we give them the exclusive
with Armstrong after he lands.

1244
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:54,751
We lost Hedges though. He's voting no.

1245
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,923
- You said they wouldn't ask about it.
- Yeah. Well... they lied.

1246
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,549
You know, people do that sometimes, Cole.

1247
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,551
You could have done yourself
and this program a favor

1248
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:05,595
and maybe tried it yourself. Right?

1249
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,430
- Blame NASA.

1250
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,598
Blame the system.

1251
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:12,102
I mean, there was half a billion dollars
worth of funding on the line.

1252
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,437
Lying must be so easy for you
when you do it all the time.

1253
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,647
It's just always an option.

1254
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:18,191
- What you should try is the truth.
- What is this sanctimonious bullshit?

1255
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,860
I'm never going to lie
about those men or that day.

1256
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:21,945
Do you understand that?

1257
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,614
You think what you want about me,

1258
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:28,743
but I didn't cost the world a dream
because I lost my goddamn cool.

1259
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:02,485
This is Launch Complex 34,
where the Apollo 1 tragedy occurred.

1260
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,196
This is a tribute to our fallen heroes,

1261
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,783
the brave men
who paved the road to our success.

1262
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,579
Please, let's take a moment
of silence for them.

1263
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,175
Edvard, that looks incredible.

1264
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,010
I can't see the wires at all.
How did you do that?

1265
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,012
I just put a flag. It's very simple.

1266
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:29,929
- Old school.
- Huh.

1267
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,432
No. Again. From the top.

1268
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:35,101
And maybe let's get
some more bounce this time.

1269
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,394
You are on the moon.

1270
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:38,855
Good.

1271
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,863
Oh, my God.
- I-I can't. I can't with this day.

1272
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,784
- Oh, dear. Uh-- Okay, hold on.
Joseph, there's a fire.

1273
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:51,910
I got it.

1274
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:54,079
Don't forget to PASS.

1275
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,713
Okay. Can you bring them down?
Actually, leave them up.

1276
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:05,965
Let them think about what they did.

1277
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,928
I give up. I'm taking lunch.

1278
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:16,309
You see what you did?
You made her take lunch early.

1279
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:18,561

- Do you want Vanning or not?

1295
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:56,641
- Ugh. No. I don't--
- Come on. Let's go.

1296
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,810
I think we could just
take a commercial flight. If we left--

1297
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,728
Nope. No commercial flights
are flying right now.

Okay, well, take these.

All right.

1302
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,863
Hold on. Hold on.

1303
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,241

01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:50,445
Yeah. New Orleans or Baton Rouge?

1316
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:52,030
- Wherever his wife's from.
- Okay.

1317
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:55,992
Cole Davis.

1318
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,869
And you must be Miss Kelly Jones.

1319
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,287
- Please come in, y'all.
- Oh.

1320
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:00,872
Thank you so much
for having us for dinner.

1321
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:04,459
Oh, now-- now,
I was told you were a New York City type.

1322
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,920
Oh, God, no. I just work there.
I'm from Louisiana.

1323
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,296
Born and raised and, one day, buried.

1324
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:11,049
- I'm from Virginia.
- No? We're family.

1325
01:15:11,049 --> 01:15:14,636
You know, Tex Ritter always said
Virginia was the mother of Texas.

1326
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:17,889
Well, we never knew who the father was.
We always suspected it was Louisiana.

1327
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:19,891
- Oh!
- Huh? My mother loves that one.

1328
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:22,060
- She was the one that came up with it.
- Oh, just so colorful.

1329
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:25,188
You're fun.
- This is a beautiful home.

1330
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:31,110
So, h-how is the campaign going, Senator?

1331
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:35,323
Truth be told,
politics is more of a hobby to me.

1332
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:40,245
Serving Christ, that's my full-time job.

1333
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:44,958
You know, there's a war on religion
in this country.

1334
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,627
And some say science is to blame.

1335
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:50,546
Well, science is
what brought us to this table.

1336
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,174
You learned a little lesson
on the provocation of pride

1337
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,843
on Apollo 1, now, didn't you, Cole?

1338
01:15:56,928 --> 01:16:01,099
Science has actually
brought me closer to God, sir.

1339
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:05,520
Took the Lord six days to put forth
everything that we know as creation.

1340
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,897
And on that sixth day,
he gave us dominion over it.

1341
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,900
And, personally,
I take that as a responsibility.

1342
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:15,405
You sound like a man
who knows his way to church.

1343
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:18,825
Well, I can't think
of a greater act of faith

1344
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:20,326
than pursuing the stars.

1345
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:25,915
"The heavens declare the glory of God.
And the firmament shows us his handiwork."

1346
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:29,127
- That's one of Jolene's favorite Psalms.

1347
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,838
You see, our men,
when they come back from space,

1348
01:16:32,672 --> 01:16:34,590
they believe more in God, not less.

1349
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,468
But when we land on the moon,

1350
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:43,141
and thanks to Miss Jones here,
the world watches us do it.

1351
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:47,603
And it's my hope that people everywhere
feel the presence of that divine.

1352
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,483
Well...

1353
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:58,948
...you've, uh, certainly
given me a lot to think about, son.

1354
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,834
You really sold the hell out of that.

1355
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,336
I wasn't selling.

1356
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,966
For the record, you can win people over
just by being who you are.

1357
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,849
You know, we're not in a rush,
so we don't really have to fly home.

1358
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,684
Ooh. That wasn't flying.

1359
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,781
Come on. Open your eyes.

1360
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:51,751
You trust me?

1361
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:55,880
Hold tight.

1362
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,350
Now, this is the fun part. Just slide off.

1363
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,523
- Perfect.

1364
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,821
<i>I've had my disagreements</i>

1365
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:05,408
<i>with the NASA program in the past.</i>

1366
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:09,662
<i>But after a great deal of thought,
and prayer,</i>

1367
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,748
<i>I've decided to vote yes.</i>

1368
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,628
- Come on.

1369
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,883
I have something that you need to see.

1370
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:23,551
- What--
- Follow me.

1371
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:25,887
Whoo! I didn't know
which way it was gonna go,

1372
01:19:25,887 --> 01:19:28,097
'cause you can't tell with these guys.

1373
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:31,058
I never liked that guy before,
but...

1374
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:33,686
- ...I like him now.

1375
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:34,937
All right!

1376
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:37,106
It's so dark in here. You--
Almost there.

1377
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,817
I'm a little scared.
Yeah, it's right around here.

1378
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,489
We wanted to show you our appreciation.

1379
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,867
- Oh, my gosh. This is too much.
- Thank you.

1380
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,911
- I can't believe it.
- It was all Walter.

1381
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:51,954
Oh, Walter? I know that
you did all of this, didn't you?

1382
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,873
A little. That's all.
- Yeah, I know you did.

1383
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:55,458
- They all helped.
- Not too bad, huh?

1384
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,184
Before I forget. Here.

1385
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:16,479
It's a list of things for you to say
when you take your first step.

1386
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:19,398
I-- I know everybody's asking you.
I thought I'd give you some options.

1387
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:21,567
Well, I was just gonna say,

1388
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,653
"Look at all those cool rocks,"
or something.

1389
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:26,322
- I got this one, Kelly.
- Okay.

1390
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,533
And thank you, though.

1391
01:20:28,533 --> 01:20:32,036
And I mean it. For, uh-- For everything.

1392
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:38,584
You know, I don't think anyone cares
about this program more than Cole Davis.

1393
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:43,464
It's nice to see he's found
something else to care about.

1394
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:57,478
<i>♪ There's a light ♪</i>

1395
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,691
<i>♪ A certain kind of light ♪</i>

1396
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:06,404
I know I'm no, uh, astronaut,
but can I steal you for a dance?

1397
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,240
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah? Come on.

1398
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,869
<i>♪ I want my life to be lived with you ♪</i>

1399
01:21:14,662 --> 01:21:16,581
<i>♪ Lived with you ♪</i>

1400
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:22,086
So, you just counting down the days
until you, uh, can get back to Manhattan?

1401
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,963
Not really.

1402
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:25,131
Good.

1403
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:27,091

1404
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,555

1409
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:48,279
Up, up, up. Perfect.
Right, now, move the light in.

1410
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:50,323
All right, keep going. Don't be shy.

1411
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:53,409
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

1412
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:57,038
Milk it. Good. Mm-hmm.

1413
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,916
Ladies, what do we think?

1414
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,377
- Lance, it's incredible.
- It's great.

1415
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:07,256
I think it needs a little more dust
and better actors,

1416
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,133
but I lost that battle.

1417
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:10,968
I will let it go.

1418
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:14,388
And stop. Okay.

1419
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,140
We've got our sun.

1420
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:19,018
I always went along
with every web you spun

1421
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:23,064
because it was fun or, like,
we were pulling one over on the bad guys,

1422
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:25,107
but this feels--

1423
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:26,275
I know.

1424
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,070
We're almost done.

1425
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,743
This is from me.

1426
01:22:35,743 --> 01:22:37,495
It is for launch day.

1427
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:40,706
Promise you will wait until then.

1428
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,083
- I promise.
Okay.

1429
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,504
Remember, you're not monsters.

1430
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,799
Are they gonna be that high?

1431
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,677
Uh, I just need
to give them any length

1432
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:55,680
{\an8}that looks like they're on the moon.
But thank you for the note.

1433
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,181
{\an8}Buzz, take it down some.

1434
01:22:57,807 --> 01:22:59,975
{\an8}And, Armstrong, stop looking at me
for approval.

1435
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,646
- Just be on the moon. I'm not here.
He's having fun. He's having fun.

1436
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:06,649
He keeps locking eyes with me.
Stop flirting and be on the moon.

1437
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:18,828
<i>Yesterday's science fiction
is today's fact.</i>

1438
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:20,246
<i>The methods are different,</i>

1439
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:22,790
<i>but the important thing
is that tomorrow morning,</i>

1440
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:25,167
<i>man will lift off toward the moon.</i>

1441
01:23:37,805 --> 01:23:40,224
<i>Good evening. I'm Walter Cronkite.</i>

1442
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:44,228
<i>And on this eve of man's first flight
toward a landing on the moon,</i>

1443
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:46,772
<i>all preparations go smoothly.</i>

1444
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,190
<i>The weather prediction,</i>

1445
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:51,026
<i>along with the health

1446
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:21,307
Yes?

1447
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:34,361
Well, you know how to hurt a fella.

1448
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:36,530
No courtesy call?

1449
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,240
Well, I don't have your number.

1450
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,325
You ran.

1451
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,536
That's what you do best.

1452
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:46,081
Your alternate version is wrong.
I never should've been a part of it.

1453
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,208
I quit.

1454
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:48,959
Sit.

1455
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,553
So, who are we gonna be today?

1456
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:01,889
Let's see.

1457
01:25:04,058 --> 01:25:06,310
Ooh, Helen Parker.

1458
01:25:06,894 --> 01:25:09,188
I bet you do a killer British accent.

1459
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:13,442
You wanna take off and be Helen? Go ahead.

1460
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:18,489
Helen doesn't have
to look over her shoulder.

1461
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:20,449
No one is coming for you.

1462
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,285
Unless?

1463
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:28,123
Unless you ever tell anyone
that Project Artemis was real,

1464
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,043
and the moon landing was fake.

1465
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:34,880
Oh, on that score, change of plans.

1466
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,965
Um,

1467
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:39,593
we're going to air the alternate version.

1468
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:40,719
No matter what.

1469
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,888
Oh, you were never gonna broadcast
the real thing.

1470
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,890
This isn't just a race for the moon.

1471
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:50,062
It is a race for which ideology
gets to run things.

1472
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:55,359
I got one of my men to rig the LEM camera
so that it just beams back audio.

1473
01:25:55,359 --> 01:26:00,656
We're gonna sync with their sound
and, uh, use your fake stage broadcast,

1474
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,575
start to finish.

1475
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:07,663
Let me be the first to thank you
on behalf of America.

1476
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:15,129
Come on, don't feel bad.
Everybody gets what they want.

1477
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:19,758
You get a new life
with no past to run from.

1478
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:25,014
And the world doesn't have to sleep
under a communist moon.

1479
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,349
Mmm.

1480
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:30,895
- Okay. Panama beckons.

1481
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,355
You better hurry. You're going to...

1482
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,149
...miss your flight, Helen.

<i>Oatmeal, toast,</i>

<i>And more vitamin C than orange juice.</i>

What are you doing here?

1496
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:54,663
I need to show you something.

1497
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,752
It was supposed to be a contingency plan.

1498
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:02,254
That's how he sold it.
It was an insurance policy.

1499
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:03,464
In case we failed.

1500
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,092
It's good to know...

1501
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,386
...that you never believed in us.

1502
01:29:09,887 --> 01:29:10,971
I know you're upset.

1503
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,723
- I understand--
- Oh, what do you understand?

1504
01:29:12,723 --> 01:29:14,725
Please tell me what you understand.

1505
01:29:14,725 --> 01:29:16,602
'Cause you don't
understand shit about truth.

1506
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:18,645
If you fake this mission--
If you fake this mission,

1507
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:22,107
every single thing that we have sacrificed
will have been for nothing.

1508
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,486
I know I messed up. I know that.

1509
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,822
But you know you couldn't have made it
to this day without me.

1510
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,325
I could've walked away last night,
but I didn't.

1511
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:34,995
I came back to fix this.

1512
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:38,248
Fix what?

1513
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,919
Moe cut the LEM camera,
and if we don't fix this together,

1514
01:29:41,919 --> 01:29:43,962
then this is gonna be the version
that the world sees.

1515
01:29:48,801 --> 01:29:50,344
It's not a contingency.

1516
01:29:53,931 --> 01:29:56,058
God, you're so good
at leaving me no options.

1517
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:03,857
Fine, let's fix it.

1518
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:07,486
But when this is over,
I never wanna see your face again.

1519
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,253
This is what happens
when you work for Richard Nixon.

1520
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:28,715
I got your book, Ruby.

1521
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:30,509
You opened it early.

1522
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:32,719
It came at just the right time.

1523
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:43,480
<i>...proper atmosphere for launch</i>

1524
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:47,067
<i>which is a combination
of oxygen and nitrogen.</i>

1525
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:50,904
<i>Sixty percent oxygen

1526
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,782
<i>Of course, the astronauts themselves

1539
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:31,570
Guys!

1540
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,405
It's busted.

1541
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:35,324
The camera's video preamplifier.

1542
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:36,867
- It's destroyed.
- Okay, can you fix that?

1543
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:38,702
I could maybe repurpose
a part from a TV, but--

1544
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,621
Well, that's fine.
There's plenty of TVs around here.

1545
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:42,206
NASA's TVs-- They are all too old.

1546
01:31:42,206 --> 01:31:44,917
I mean a brand-new solid-state color TV.

1547
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,418
Well, how fast can you get one?

1548
01:31:47,044 --> 01:31:48,670
How fast can you get me
to an electronics store?

1549
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,672
- Me?
- In the worst traffic in Florida history.

1550
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:51,924
I can't. I have to prep the guys.

1551
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:53,342
Give me the keys.

1552
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:55,928
Fine, I'll stall.

1553
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:57,930

Yeah, okay.

Go.

1595
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,967
Okay, we need to initiate prelaunch,
or we lose the window.

1596
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:23,009

1609
01:35:57,878 --> 01:35:58,962
It's connected.

1610
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:01,214
At least I think I connected it.

1611
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:04,259
- Stu, what the hell does that mean?

1612
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:07,888
I only had a few seconds.
I didn't have time to stress test it. I--

Okay. Sit down.

1614

1619

So, let's keep it.

1620
01:36:42,047 --> 01:36:44,382
All right. Give me "Go/No go" for launch.

1621

<i>Ah, roger. All stations, stand by</i>

1622

<i>SCS.</i>
- This is the best part.

1629
01:36:56,269 --> 01:36:59,022
They go down the line and every single--

1630
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:02,150
every single technician has to say,
"Go," or, "No go," for launch.

1631
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,527
Any one of them can stop it.

1632

1633

<i>Apollo 11 is on the way.</i>

1647
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:04,541
<i>250,000 miles away,</i>

1648
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:08,837
{\an8}<i>where the moon is waiting
for man's first arrival.</i>

1649
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:11,047
<i>Flight to take, uh, three days.</i>

1650
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,509
<i>And, uh, the, uh, spacecraft
to reach there...</i>

1651
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,052
Kelly told me everything.

1652
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:18,513
<i>The landing to take place on Sunday.</i>

1653
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:19,764
<i>And Neil Armstrong to set...</i>

1654
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,349
<i>Bravissimo.</i>

1655
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:23,101
- Shove it.
- That was history.

1656
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:25,353
Hi, Helen. Uh, sorry, Kelly.

1657
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:28,773
I heard you came back, so I came back too.

1658
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:34,696
I-- I took a little peeky-poo
at the moon set,

1659
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:37,490
and it is perfection.

1660
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:38,992
Great job.

1661
01:40:38,992 --> 01:40:42,203
If you think that I'm gonna let you
broadcast some fake version of this,

1662
01:40:42,203 --> 01:40:43,705
I'll go to the press right now.

1663
01:40:43,705 --> 01:40:45,707
Cole.

1664
01:40:46,416 --> 01:40:48,168
Cole. Cole.

1665
01:40:52,172 --> 01:40:56,676
You, uh-- You go to the press.
Bring 'em by the moon set,

1666
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:02,515
but just know that no one will ever trust
the legitimacy of NASA again.

1667
01:41:02,515 --> 01:41:05,518
This is a matter of national security.

1668
01:41:05,518 --> 01:41:08,772
This broadcast must take place
in a controlled setting.

1669
01:41:08,772 --> 01:41:11,316
You of all people must understand that.

1670
01:41:12,192 --> 01:41:15,945
The mission isn't about landing
on the moon anymore.

1671
01:41:15,945 --> 01:41:21,493
It is about the world watching
America beat Russia on TV.

1672
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:29,209
I got a flight to catch.

1673
01:41:31,628 --> 01:41:36,132
I'll be back in time
for the lunar broadcast.

1674
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,634
I thought I'd watch it here.

1675
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:40,929
With you, Kelly. On the moon.

1676
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,773
Hey. We're making history.

1677
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:26,015
Everything you said about me is true.

1678
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:28,560
I'm a con artist, and I always have been.

1679
01:42:31,855 --> 01:42:33,439
My real name is not even Kelly.

1680
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:38,361
All those stories that I told you

1681
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:40,655
about my mom and I
selling products door-to-door,

1682
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:41,739
those were true.

1683
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:44,117
They were all scams.

1684
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:47,704
And we started out small,
and then they got bigger.

1685
01:42:48,413 --> 01:42:51,332
Like real estate and insurance.

1686
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:52,417
And...

1687
01:42:54,419 --> 01:42:58,840
when I was 16,
a guy in North Dakota pulled a gun

1688
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,843
and my mom pulled hers out first
and she killed him.

1689
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:04,888
And she told me to run and I did.

1690
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,724
And she went to prison
and I never saw her again.

1691
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:15,356
And I forged documents
and used fake names to get jobs.

1692
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:19,360
And when I went to New York,
I found advertising.

1693
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:23,907
And that was like the scams
that my mom taught me, but it was legal.

1694
01:43:27,368 --> 01:43:29,162
And I lied to so many people.

1695
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:32,457
The worst lies were
the ones I told myself.

1696
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:36,169
That everybody does it.
You know. It's just a big game.

1697
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:40,131
But then I came down here...

1698
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:44,552
I met you.

1699
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:52,810
I learned what it was like
to be a part of something real.

1700
01:43:56,648 --> 01:43:58,942
Moe offered me a way to erase my past.

1701
01:43:58,942 --> 01:44:00,777
I thought that's what I wanted, but...

1702
01:44:04,364 --> 01:44:05,865
I don't wanna run anymore.

1703
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:16,626
Moe is a worthy opponent,
but he has met his match.

1704
01:44:20,797 --> 01:44:24,759
I promise this is the last time I will
trick anyone into getting what I want.

1705
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,387
I promise.

1706
01:44:29,722 --> 01:44:31,599
Do you think you can do it without lying?

1707
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:35,603
- Absolutely not.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

1708
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:42,360
So, what's the plan?

1709
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,531
<i>Why are we meeting out here?</i>

1710
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:49,784
Because Moe bugs everything.
The guy's like Houdini. He's everywhere.

1711
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:52,704
Okay, so, Moe doesn't know
that we fixed the LEM camera.

1712
01:44:52,704 --> 01:44:54,163
We build a plan around that.

1713
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:57,875
All we have to do is convince him that
we are broadcasting the fake moon landing,

1714
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,961
when in reality,
we're broadcasting the real one.

1715
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:02,714
Is there a way that we could rig
the equipment

1716
01:45:02,714 --> 01:45:05,216
so that it actually sends out
the real LEM video feed?

1717
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:07,218
Come on, boys.

1718
01:45:07,218 --> 01:45:09,679
You figured out how to land on the moon.
Give me a hypothetical.

1719
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:13,558
Okay, um, hypothetically,
we could rewire it.

1720
01:45:13,558 --> 01:45:16,227
So that it only picks up
the broadcast signal from Mission Control.

1721
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,229
- Sure, then sync it with our feed.
Hmm. Right.

1722
01:45:24,152 --> 01:45:25,153
Hey, fellas.

1723
01:45:26,029 --> 01:45:28,614
Moe Berkus sent these guys
to test the broadcast feed.

1724
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:31,242
- Moe-- Moe Berk-- Yes.
Moe Berk-- Moe Berkus.

1725
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:34,412
Telling me none of you got the phone call?

1726
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:36,998
Great. All right, where's the camera?

1727
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:42,378
- Are you okay?
- Mmm.

1728
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:44,839
Can you guys hurry up, please?

1729
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:47,383
Don, maybe just take the cigarette out.

1730
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:50,887
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've just never smoked a cigarette before.

1731
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,097
I don't like it.

1732
01:45:55,433 --> 01:45:57,268
<i>...uh, 11, this is Houston.</i>

1733
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:58,478
<i>Uh, you are go for LOI. Over.</i>

1734
01:45:58,478 --> 01:46:00,229
<i>Confirmed. On track for the moon.</i>

1735
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:02,106
<i>Apollo 11, this is Houston.</i>

1736
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,567
<i>All your systems are looking good.
Going around the corner.</i>

1737
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:06,110
<i>We'll see you on the other side. Over.</i>

1738
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,029
<i>And we've had loss of signal</i>

1739
01:46:08,029 --> 01:46:10,490
<i>as Apollo 11 goes behind the moon.</i>

1740
01:46:11,157 --> 01:46:14,494
<i>It's now 3:30 Eastern Daylight Time.</i>

1741
01:46:14,494 --> 01:46:18,664
<i>At 3:46 we should be getting
the first signal from the Lunar Module.</i>

1742
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:21,292
<i>The estimated audience:
hundreds of millions.</i>

1743
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:23,961
<i>Perhaps 400 million persons
or so are watching</i>

1744
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:27,799
<i>this broadcast today of, uh,
the greatest event...</i>

1745
01:46:27,799 --> 01:46:28,841
Boys.

1746
01:46:30,343 --> 01:46:31,677
All right. Let's go.

1747
01:46:39,769 --> 01:46:42,563
A little bit more. Well done, guys.

1748
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:50,279
Boys, when you hear my voice,
you hear God.

1749
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:52,198
Now, this is a fake moon,

1750
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:54,075
- but to the world, it's real.
- It's showtime, folks.

1751
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:55,618
It needs to-- Remember where I left off.

1752
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:59,122
Your government thanks you
for the work you're about to do.

1753
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:01,624
Now, don't fuck it up.

1754
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,961
What is this nasty shit doing here?

1755
01:47:06,379 --> 01:47:08,381
- God.
- Excuse me.

1756
01:47:08,381 --> 01:47:10,883
This is a Tab set, and that is my chair.

1757
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:13,261
- Kelly, let's deal with this.
- Lance, thank you so much.

1758
01:47:13,261 --> 01:47:15,304
So, these screens-- This is our feed.

1759
01:47:15,304 --> 01:47:16,389
Yeah.

1760
01:47:16,389 --> 01:47:17,932
Okay. And then--

1761
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:20,434
{\an8}And the TV's a live broadcast. Okay.

1762
01:47:22,395 --> 01:47:23,396
Right.

1763
01:47:23,896 --> 01:47:25,314
Joseph, I'm sitting.

1764
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,024
Oh, my God. Are you real?

1765
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:29,068
I am the director, Lance Vespertine.

1766
01:47:31,904 --> 01:47:33,406
Stay out of my way, will you?

1767
01:47:33,406 --> 01:47:36,117
All right, I'd say it was nice
to meet you, but so far, it is not.

1768
01:47:36,117 --> 01:47:37,869
The pigeon's in the coop.

1769
01:47:37,869 --> 01:47:39,078
Copy that.

1770
01:47:42,373 --> 01:47:44,333
<i>Okay, you should have him now, Houston.</i>

1771
01:47:44,834 --> 01:47:47,336
<i>Eagle, we've
got you now. It's looking good. Over.</i>

1772
01:47:50,298 --> 01:47:53,342
<i>We've got the Earth
right out of our front window.</i>

1773
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:55,761
<i>Flight, we are go for landing.</i>

1774
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,431
<i>Roger. Understand.
Go for landing. 3,000 feet.</i>

1775
01:47:59,599 --> 01:48:01,475
<i>Eagle, looking great. You're go.</i>

1776
01:48:14,197 --> 01:48:17,950
<i>Position checks
downrange show us to be a little long.</i>

1777
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:20,286
<i>1,400 feet. Still looking very good.</i>

1778
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:21,370
<i>P30.</i>

1779
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:23,206
<i>Six plus two-five.</i>

1780
01:48:23,206 --> 01:48:24,790
<i>Looks like about 820.</i>

1781
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,292
<i>Throttle down.</i>

1782
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:30,588
<i>Flight, this is Eagle.</i>

1783
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:34,008
<i>Sea of Tranquility is rockier
than expected.</i>

1784
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:36,802
<i>We're gonna have to extend
another thousand feet.</i>

1785
01:48:36,802 --> 01:48:38,179
Hey, boys.

1786
01:48:40,473 --> 01:48:41,599
Where does that put us?

1787
01:48:41,599 --> 01:48:43,768
- It'll give 'em 15 seconds of fuel left.
- They're gonna wanna abort.

1788
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:46,103
Neil can do this,
they just gotta let him.

1789
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:48,397
<i>Stand by, Eagle.</i>

1790
01:48:48,397 --> 01:48:50,983
<i>We are calculating
what that will do to our fuel reserves.</i>

1791
01:48:50,983 --> 01:48:55,154
<i>EECOM puts that within 15 seconds.
Prepare for abort.</i>

1792
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:57,865
Flight...

1793
01:48:57,865 --> 01:49:01,202
...we have run successful
tests within that range. Let 'em land.

1794
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:05,498
<i>Thirty. Thirty seconds.</i>

1795
01:49:05,498 --> 01:49:07,166
- That's a lie.
- You lied.

1796
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:09,418
I've learned some new tricks. Sit down.

1797
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:12,088
<i>Okay, the only
callouts from now on will be fuel.</i>

1798
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:14,674
Come on.

1799
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,385
<i>Eagle, looking great. You're go.</i>

1800
01:49:17,969 --> 01:49:20,137
<i>1,400 feet.
Still looking very good.</i>

1801
01:49:22,515 --> 01:49:24,433
<i>350 feet, down at four.</i>

1802
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:27,061
<i>Thirty. Thirty seconds</i>.

1803
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:28,646
<i>Down two and a half.
Forward.</i>

1804
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:31,023
- <i>Forward. Good.</i>
<i>Roger that.</i>

1805
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:34,819
<i>Eleven forward.
Coming down nicely.</i>

1806
01:49:34,819 --> 01:49:36,570
<i>200 feet, four and a half down.</i>

1807
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:39,282
<i>Five and a half down.
Five and a half down, nine forward.</i>

1808
01:49:39,282 --> 01:49:40,366
<i>That's good.</i>

1809
01:49:54,005 --> 01:49:55,047
<i>Contact light.</i>

1810
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:00,469
<i>Engine stop.</i>

1811
01:50:12,857 --> 01:50:13,983
<i>Flight.</i>

1812
01:50:15,693 --> 01:50:17,320
<i>Tranquility Base here.</i>

1813
01:50:17,862 --> 01:50:19,363
<i>The Eagle has landed.</i>

1814
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:28,831
<i>Roger, Tranquility,
we copy on the ground.</i>

1815
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:31,000
<i>You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.</i>

1816
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,543
<i>We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.</i>

1817
01:50:39,342 --> 01:50:40,426
<i>Whew. Boy.</i>

1818
01:50:40,426 --> 01:50:42,178
<i>We're going to be busy for a minute.</i>

1819
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:47,933
All right, all right, all right. Come on.

1820
01:50:48,726 --> 01:50:51,312
Let's focus. We're only halfway there.

1821
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:54,607
Yeah, we've got it from here.
Thank you, guys.

1822
01:50:54,607 --> 01:50:57,693
Places. Places, everyone. Look sharp.

1823
01:50:57,693 --> 01:50:58,944
Let's look sharp!

1824
01:50:58,944 --> 01:51:01,238
Edvard, Edvard, off the stage.
You're killing me.

1825
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:05,159
Edvard, we are done. Uh-uh.
You're done. No more tweaking.

1826
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:07,495
- What are you, the repeater?
- No, I'm not the repeater.

1827
01:51:07,495 --> 01:51:09,580
This is the system we created
before you got here.

1828
01:51:16,796 --> 01:51:18,297
<i>Camera is coming down.</i>

1829
01:51:25,179 --> 01:51:29,767
Three, two, one, and action.

1830
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:35,106
<i>And we're getting a picture on the TV.</i>

1831
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:37,942
<i>You got a good picture, huh?</i>

1832
01:51:37,942 --> 01:51:40,820
<i>Uh, there's
a great deal of contrast in it.</i>

1833
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:42,947
<i>Roger,
TV circuit breaker's in,</i>

1834
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:45,866
<i>and read you loud and clear.</i>

1835
01:51:47,368 --> 01:51:48,577
<i>Roger.</i>

1836
01:51:53,833 --> 01:51:56,502
<i>Okay.
Will you verify the position, uh,</i>

1837
01:51:56,502 --> 01:51:58,546
<i>the, uh, opening I ought to have
on the camera?</i>

1838
01:51:58,546 --> 01:51:59,839
<i>Stand by.</i>

1839
01:51:59,839 --> 01:52:02,675
Armstrong, prepare to disembark.

1840
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:05,302
<i>Your visor.</i>

1841
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:11,225
<i>I am opening the door for egress.</i>

1842
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:33,998
<i>Okay, Neil,
we can see you coming down the ladder now.</i>

1843
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,877
Okay, left.

1844
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:41,380
And right.

1845
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:46,385
Left and right.

1846
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:49,054
Now, left foot off. Left foot off.

1847
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:52,349
Easy. Easy. Step down.

1848
01:52:53,184 --> 01:52:55,853
And land.

1849
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:58,314
How do you know what, uh,
he's gonna do ahead of time?

1850
01:52:58,314 --> 01:53:01,984
NASA rehearsed all of this,
and Kelly appropriated it.

1851
01:53:02,902 --> 01:53:04,195
Oh, stole it.

1852
01:53:04,904 --> 01:53:06,530
I knew I hired the right people.

1853
01:53:07,907 --> 01:53:09,283
Okay, here we go.

1854
01:53:12,786 --> 01:53:14,747
It's seamless. It's incredible.

1855
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:18,083
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

1856
01:53:18,584 --> 01:53:22,963
<i>The LEM footpads are only depressed
in the surface about one or two inches,</i>

1857
01:53:22,963 --> 01:53:28,594
<i>although the surface appears to be very,
very fine-grained as you get close to it.</i>

1858
01:53:28,594 --> 01:53:33,140
<i>It's almost like a powder.
Down there, it's very fine.</i>

1859
01:53:34,475 --> 01:53:36,227
<i>I'm gonna step off the LEM now.</i>

1860
01:53:42,191 --> 01:53:44,777
<i>That's one small step for man...</i>

1861
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:51,659
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

1862
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,458
We could have spent years coming up
with something that good.

1863
01:54:00,668 --> 01:54:02,169
- Yeah.

1864
01:54:02,878 --> 01:54:05,548
- Was that, uh, in the script?

1865
01:54:05,548 --> 01:54:06,966
No.

1866
01:54:08,342 --> 01:54:09,468
That's a good line.

1867
01:54:14,515 --> 01:54:17,893
<i>It's a very simple matter
to hop down from one step to the next.</i>

1868
01:54:18,394 --> 01:54:20,229
<i>Neil is now unveiling the plaque.</i>

1869
01:54:21,355 --> 01:54:23,315
<i>"Here man,
from the planet Earth,</i>

1870
01:54:23,315 --> 01:54:28,445
<i>first set foot upon the moon,
July 1969 AD.</i>

1871
01:54:28,445 --> 01:54:30,990
<i>We came in peace for all mankind."</i>

1872
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:35,869
<i>You ready for the camera?</i>

1873
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:39,290
<i>Uh, Neil, this is
Houston. The field of view is okay.</i>

1874
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:42,001
<i>We'd like you to aim it
a little bit more to the right. Over.</i>

1875
01:54:42,501 --> 01:54:43,586
<i>Okay.</i>

1876
01:54:44,545 --> 01:54:46,088
<i>Too much to the right.</i>

1877
01:54:46,088 --> 01:54:48,382
<i>Can you bring it back left about, uh,
four or five degrees?</i>

1878
01:54:53,596 --> 01:54:55,264
<i>Okay. That looks good, Neil.</i>

1879
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:59,393
<i>Columbia, Columbia,
this is Houston, AOS. Over.</i>

1880
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:01,895
<i>Neil Armstrong
has been on the lunar surface now</i>

1881
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:02,980
<i>almost 45 minutes.</i>

1882
01:55:03,564 --> 01:55:05,983
<i>Uh, Tranquility Base, this is Houston.</i>

1883
01:55:05,983 --> 01:55:08,444
<i>Could we get both of you on the camera
for a minute, please?</i>

1884
01:55:09,194 --> 01:55:13,240
{\an8}<i>The President of the United States would
like to say a few words to you. Over.</i>

1885
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,159
<i>That would be an honor.</i>

1886
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:17,661
<i>All right, go ahead, Mr. President.</i>

1887
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:18,746
<i>This is Houston. Out.</i>

1888
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:20,539
<i>Hello, Neil and Buzz.</i>

1889
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:25,544
<i>I am talking to you by telephone
from the Oval Room at the White House...</i>

1890
01:55:25,544 --> 01:55:27,713
They have Secret Service
all over this place.

1891
01:55:27,713 --> 01:55:31,967
<i>...and this certainly has to be the most
historic telephone call ever made.</i>

1892
01:55:33,302 --> 01:55:34,928
<i>And as you talk to us...</i>

1893
01:55:34,928 --> 01:55:37,431
He actually reminds me a lot of you.

1894
01:55:37,431 --> 01:55:40,100
Do not say that.
No, don't even joke about that.

1895
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:45,105
We're still holding while
the president drones on. Don't move.

1896
01:55:45,105 --> 01:55:46,815
Armstrong, I'm watching you the most.

1897
01:55:46,815 --> 01:55:51,153
<i>For one priceless moment
in the whole history of man...</i>

1898
01:55:51,153 --> 01:55:52,738
<i>Kennedy, let's go direct.</i>

1899
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:57,368
<i>Cole, are you receiving picture?</i>

1900
01:55:57,368 --> 01:55:59,161
<i>The video feed light isn't on up here.</i>

1901
01:55:59,161 --> 01:56:02,331
Uh, what do you mean, Neil?
It's not working?

1902
01:56:02,331 --> 01:56:04,375
<i>You tell me. Do you see picture?</i>

1903
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:07,294
<i>We're getting a power surge warning
on the camera.</i>

1904
01:56:07,294 --> 01:56:09,755
<i>I think it crapped out.
Can you still see us?</i>

1905
01:56:09,755 --> 01:56:11,715
Yeah, I can still see you.

1906
01:56:13,592 --> 01:56:14,760
Um, one second, Neil.

1907
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,137
Neil's saying the video feed light
isn't on up there.

1908
01:56:17,137 --> 01:56:18,472
Are you sure that camera's working?

1909
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:20,683
I installed the new part.
It should be working just fine but--

1910
01:56:20,683 --> 01:56:23,060
- But what?
- But I-- I was in a rush.

1911
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:25,688
Shit.

1912
01:56:29,483 --> 01:56:30,484
What's wrong?

1913
01:56:30,484 --> 01:56:33,862
We're not sure that the camera
on the LEM is working.

1914
01:56:33,862 --> 01:56:36,490
<i>I think that's your feed broadcasting.</i>

1915
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:40,119
<i>Does the feed on your TV
look like your set?</i>

1916
01:56:42,913 --> 01:56:44,790
I-- I can't tell if it's us.

1917
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:47,918
Test it. Have one of your agents give
a little wave or something.

1918
01:56:48,502 --> 01:56:51,380
I can't. Everyone is here.

1919
01:57:03,434 --> 01:57:04,560
Oh.

1920
01:57:08,605 --> 01:57:10,733
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1921
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:13,986
He is two inches away
from being on that screen.

1922
01:57:13,986 --> 01:57:15,070
It's-- It's one inch.

1923
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:16,822
Is that in your goddamn script?

1924
01:57:19,158 --> 01:57:20,659
Joseph, were there new pages?

1925
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:23,412
<i>...representing not only the United States</i>

1926
01:57:23,412 --> 01:57:25,664
<i>but men of peace of all nations...</i>

1927
01:57:28,917 --> 01:57:32,629
Oh, Mischief! Oh, God.
Kitty, kitty! Pss, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1928
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:33,839
Mischief! Mischief!

1929
01:57:33,839 --> 01:57:35,299
Where are you going?

1930
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:37,843
Mischief. Mischief.
- K-- Kelly.

1931
01:57:37,843 --> 01:57:39,386
Come here.
- The cat?

1932
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:40,763
Come here. Come here. Come here.

1933
01:57:49,313 --> 01:57:51,064
- Do you know this cat?

1934
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,026
Kitty, kitty, kitty!

1935
01:57:54,026 --> 01:57:56,862
Come here, you sweet--
Come here, you little bitch.

1936
01:57:56,862 --> 01:57:58,405
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

1937
01:57:58,405 --> 01:57:59,990
- Come here, you!
No!

1938
01:58:02,242 --> 01:58:05,162
Kelly, what the hell is going on
over there?

1939
01:58:05,162 --> 01:58:06,455
<i>Kelly? Kelly?</i>

1940
01:58:06,455 --> 01:58:08,999
Go round the back!

1941
01:58:08,999 --> 01:58:10,667
Mischief! Mischief!

1942
01:58:12,044 --> 01:58:13,086
Kitty, kitty, kitty!

1943
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:15,255
Catch him! Catch him! Oh! Go, go.

1944
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:16,507
Let's go! Come on.

1945
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:20,969
Come here. It's okay.

1946
01:58:20,969 --> 01:58:22,805
Mischief. Just come here.

1947
01:58:22,805 --> 01:58:24,223
Just shut up. Just shut up!

1948
01:58:24,223 --> 01:58:27,267
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, little baby. You know me.

1949
01:58:28,644 --> 01:58:29,895
No!

1950
01:58:44,243 --> 01:58:45,828
<i>And thank you very much</i>

1951
01:58:45,828 --> 01:58:47,746
<i>and I look forward,
all of us look forward,</i>

1952
01:58:47,746 --> 01:58:49,832
<i>to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.</i>

1953
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,462
<i>I look forward to that very much, sir.</i>

1954
01:58:58,715 --> 01:58:59,925
Those are your guys, Cole.

1955
01:59:00,509 --> 01:59:02,594
Yes! Those are our guys!

1956
01:59:06,682 --> 01:59:08,475
Yes. I know you know that.

1957
01:59:08,475 --> 01:59:10,727
Just reminding everybody
what we're doing here today.

1958
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:12,938
Those are our guys.

1959
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:15,023
Carry on.

1960
01:59:21,196 --> 01:59:22,865
What am I looking at here?

1961
01:59:22,865 --> 01:59:24,533
Oh, that's the moon.

1962
01:59:26,243 --> 01:59:27,786
<i>Neil, this is Houston.</i>

1963
01:59:27,786 --> 01:59:29,371
<i>Did you get the Hasselblad magazine...</i>

1964
01:59:29,371 --> 01:59:30,622
That's really the moon?

1965
01:59:30,622 --> 01:59:34,209
<i>Yes, I did. And we got about, uh...</i>

1966
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:36,920
- Jesus, it looks fake.
- <i>...I'd say 20 pounds of, uh...</i>

1967
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:40,507
<i>...carefully selected,
if not documented samples.</i>

1968
01:59:41,633 --> 01:59:43,051
<i>Houston.</i>

1969
01:59:43,051 --> 01:59:44,803
<i>Roger. Well done. Out.</i>

1970
01:59:44,803 --> 01:59:48,181
<i>Unofficial time
off the surface at 111:37:32.</i>

1971
01:59:54,021 --> 01:59:56,607
I never thought I would see
the moon up close.

1972
01:59:56,607 --> 01:59:57,691
Me neither, Walter.

1973
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:06,825
I didn't get it. Oh, my God.
Sorry.

1974
02:00:06,825 --> 02:00:08,911
Not like last time.
No. Don't point it at us.

1975
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:11,455
In Polish, we call it <i>"na zdrowie."</i>

1976
02:00:11,455 --> 02:00:14,082
All right. <i>Na zdrowie.</i>
- Okay, okay, okay. Kelly.

1977
02:00:14,082 --> 02:00:15,709
- Kelly. Kelly.
- It's getting a little better.

1978
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:18,962
- Yes? What?
- Christ, just say it. Just say it once.

1979
02:00:19,588 --> 02:00:21,048
You are the best director I know.

1980
02:00:21,048 --> 02:00:24,134
I am. [inhales sharply] Now, I know
we're not supposed to talk about this,

1981
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:26,678
but, Kelly, this would be so great
on my résumé if I-- Just feels--

1982
02:00:26,678 --> 02:00:29,139
Anyone mentions this to anyone,

1983
02:00:29,139 --> 02:00:32,643
you will spend the rest of your life
in a dark, dank prison cell

1984
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:34,311
on a nameless island.

1985
02:00:35,854 --> 02:00:38,774
Oh.
- Now, to wash down the bubbly,

1986
02:00:38,774 --> 02:00:42,611
on behalf of the US government,
have a little, uh, scotch.

1987
02:00:42,611 --> 02:00:43,987
Hmm.
- Edvard.

1988
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:45,197
I'll take one of those.

1989
02:00:45,197 --> 02:00:48,241
I had a billion-dollar TV show
for an audience of one.

1990
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:50,285
- Hope you enjoyed it.

1991
02:00:50,285 --> 02:00:53,038
Cheers.
- It was a perfect failure.

1992
02:00:53,038 --> 02:00:55,749
- That's right. Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers.

1993
02:00:55,749 --> 02:00:57,000
- Mmm.

1994
02:00:59,211 --> 02:01:01,254
Can I talk with you a moment?

1995
02:01:03,507 --> 02:01:06,551
Not many people have gone
against my orders

1996
02:01:06,551 --> 02:01:07,970
and lived to talk about it.

1997
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:11,682
Then again, not many people
have saved my ass.

1998
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:15,811
It would've been a real doozy to explain
how the cat ended up on the moon.

1999
02:01:16,812 --> 02:01:18,897
You're a goddamn American hero.

2000
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:21,441
Great job.

2001
02:01:23,652 --> 02:01:26,196
Now, this place is crawling with press.

2002
02:01:26,196 --> 02:01:30,492
So, uh, we can't really clear anything out
until after splashdown.

2003
02:01:30,492 --> 02:01:35,038
In the meantime, shred any documents
associated with the shoot.

2004
02:01:35,956 --> 02:01:38,667
Your name will be wiped
from the history books.

2005
02:01:38,667 --> 02:01:41,044
The story, rewritten.

2006
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:45,132
- Then I'm free to go.
- You are.

2007
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:52,014
Although, I could use someone like you
for an upcoming project.

2008
02:01:53,765 --> 02:01:54,891
No, thanks.

2009
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:57,561
Suit yourself. Hard to get, but okay.

2010
02:01:59,062 --> 02:02:05,110
If you ever need me... just holler.
I'm probably listening.

2011
02:02:10,615 --> 02:02:13,035
Oh. Moe.

2012
02:02:16,038 --> 02:02:17,873
Are there really aliens out there?

2013
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,169
They walk among us.

2014
02:02:26,214 --> 02:02:29,509
<i>Fly me to the moon</i>

2015
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:34,222
<i>Let's play among the stars</i>

2016
02:02:34,973 --> 02:02:40,479
<i>Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars...</i>

2017
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:42,397
<i>A quarter of a million miles.</i>

2018
02:02:42,397 --> 02:02:44,858
<i>Just think of it as,
uh, Neil Armstrong said,</i>

2019
02:02:44,858 --> 02:02:48,361
<i>the first words
as man stepped foot on the moon,</i>

2020
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:52,908
<i>"A small step for man,
a giant leap for mankind."</i>

2021
02:02:53,742 --> 02:02:55,911
<i>And a day that can never come again.</i>

2022
02:02:55,911 --> 02:02:59,247
<i>A day that shall forever live in history,
as will those words,</i>

2023
02:02:59,247 --> 02:03:01,291
<i>which will be memorized by schoolboys...</i>

2024
02:03:01,291 --> 02:03:04,920
Armstrong, you've got a future.
Not in acting. My God, no.

2025
02:03:06,088 --> 02:03:08,340
Well, Kelly, Patty-- Patty, right?

2026
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:10,008
- My name is Ruby.
Uh-huh.

2027
02:03:10,008 --> 02:03:11,760
- We did it.
No, we didn't.

2028
02:03:21,978 --> 02:03:23,438
<i>This is, uh, landward here.</i>

2029
02:03:23,438 --> 02:03:26,108
<i>Uh, Swim One has Apollo visual.</i>

2030
02:03:26,108 --> 02:03:28,568
<i>Well, if it's coming down nine miles away,</i>

2031
02:03:28,568 --> 02:03:31,947
<i>uh, that's just going to be at the,
uh, outer limit of, uh, visibility...</i>

2032
02:03:31,947 --> 02:03:33,698
Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

2033
02:03:49,923 --> 02:03:51,758
<i>They're back from the moon.</i>

2034
02:03:51,758 --> 02:03:54,386
<i>Astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins</i>

2035
02:03:54,386 --> 02:03:57,889
<i>landing in the Pacific Ocean,
southwest of Hawaii.</i>

2036
02:04:03,895 --> 02:04:06,148
I guess you deserve a cigarette.

2037
02:04:07,524 --> 02:04:10,485
- Aw, buddy.
- Yeah, yeah. I, uh...

2038
02:04:13,405 --> 02:04:17,117
I didn't wanna lose it
in there. You know?

2039
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:20,829
You know, I know you didn't want
the camera up there,

2040
02:04:20,829 --> 02:04:24,249
but, man, seeing that was, uh...

2041
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:28,003
It was life-changing.

2042
02:04:29,171 --> 02:04:31,548
- We did it.
- We did. We did, man.

2043
02:04:33,425 --> 02:04:36,219
Hey, it's 1969, right?
We got it in before the decade.

2044
02:04:36,219 --> 02:04:39,222
I know. Not a moment to spare.
- Oh. Yeah, we did.

2045
02:04:39,222 --> 02:04:40,974
Look who it is.
Hey.

2046
02:04:43,143 --> 02:04:45,228
- Go. Get out of here.
Yeah.

2047
02:04:47,272 --> 02:04:50,066
Listen, uh,
it's not too late for you either, kid.

2048
02:04:51,193 --> 02:04:52,569
- Thank you, Henry.
- All right.

2049
02:04:56,114 --> 02:04:57,073
Hey.

2050
02:04:59,409 --> 02:05:00,619
We did it.

2051
02:05:02,412 --> 02:05:03,788
Hey, guys, huh?

2052
02:05:03,788 --> 02:05:05,081
Sent a man to the moon.

2053
02:05:21,514 --> 02:05:22,515
You know...

2054
02:05:28,188 --> 02:05:29,481
I never did catch your name.

2055
02:05:37,113 --> 02:05:38,114
Winnie.

2056
02:05:40,951 --> 02:05:43,662
Winnie. Nice to meet you, Winnie.

2057
02:05:46,957 --> 02:05:49,000
You know, the Russians,
they-- they're saying

2058
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,378
that we shot the whole thing
on a soundstage.

2059
02:05:51,378 --> 02:05:53,755
I wonder where they got
a crazy idea like that.

2060
02:05:55,048 --> 02:05:56,424
Who cares what they think?

2061
02:05:57,968 --> 02:06:00,804
Truth is still the truth
even if nobody believes it.

2062
02:06:02,722 --> 02:06:05,308
Lie is still a lie
even if everybody believes it.

2063
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:09,646
You know, you really nailed this.

2064
02:06:11,898 --> 02:06:13,817
All the way down to the lunar dust.

2065
02:06:16,194 --> 02:06:17,612
Too bad it's all fake.

2066
02:06:24,494 --> 02:06:25,495
Was that fake?

2067
02:06:27,664 --> 02:06:29,499
No, that felt very real.
