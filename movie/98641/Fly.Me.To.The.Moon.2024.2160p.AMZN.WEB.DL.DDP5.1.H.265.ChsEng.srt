1
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,070
1957年10月 苏联将
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched

2
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,450
世界上第一颗人造卫星 斯普特尼克1号送入轨道
the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit.

3
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,580
这一成就加剧了美苏两国之间的太空竞赛
Their achievement fueled a space race between the United States and the Soviets.

4
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,410
之后发生了什么 人们说法不一
There has been some debate about what followed

5
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,380
但我亲身经历过 所以接下来讲的都是真事 基本上是吧
but I was there, and this is the real story. Mostly.

6
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,750
直到两天前
Until two days ago,

7
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,090
地球上的人才头一次听到这个声音
that sound had never been heard on this earth.

8
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,840
(苏联人将卫星送进太空)

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,810
(《生活》 太空竞赛)

10
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,310
(美国卫星一败涂地)

11
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,270
美国尝试发射自己的卫星 结果惨不忍睹

12
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,560
(美国火箭计划启动失败)

13
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,980
苏联成功地将一个人送入太空
The Soviet Union has sent a man into space

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,980
(第一个进入太空的人)

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,110
并把他活着带回地球
and brought him back alive.

16
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,070
苏联人在全世界范围内
The Soviets made the most of the flight

17
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,620
大肆宣传这次航天行动 其国内自然也是举国欢庆
in their worldwide propaganda. Naturally, there was jubilation in Russia.

18
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,580
在认识到苏联人取得领先后
Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets,

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,000
我认为我国应致力于实现一个目标
I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal,

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,130
即在这个十年内
before this decade is out,

21
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,010
把一个人送上月球并让他安全返回地球
of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,010
(美国宇航员环绕地球飞行)

23
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,070
我们选择在这个十年登月
We choose to go to the moon in this decade

24
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,280
并完成其他壮举 不是因为这个目标轻而易举
and do the other things, not because they are easy,

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,990
而是因为它困难重重
but because they are hard.

26
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,530
因为这个挑战是我们愿意接受
Because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,

27
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,330
不愿推迟 并准备大获全胜的
one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.

28
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,500
指挥飞行员 一 二 三 四 五
Command Pilot. One, two, three, four, five.

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,160
五 四 三 二 一
Five, four, three, two, one.

30
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,670
着火了
Flame!

31
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,880
驾驶舱里失火了
We've got a fire in the cockpit.

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,960
快出去 我们要烧死了
Let's get out! We're burning up!

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,130
宇航员维吉尔·格里森 爱德华·怀特 和罗杰·查菲不幸遇难
Astronauts Virgil Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee have been killed.

34
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,220
媒体官员称 因为此次悲剧事件
Press officials say because of the tragedy,

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,640
阿波罗1号飞行任务将被无限期推迟
the Apollo 1 flight has now been postponed indefinitely.

36
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,430
我... 登月之旅很有吸引力
I... It's, uh... It's a groovy trip,

37
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,100
但在美国 还有很多更重要的事情要先做
but there are a lot more important things to do first in the United States.

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,940
也许把这些事情都搞定了 我们才能登月
Maybe when all that's taken care of we can afford to go to the moon.

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,570
我们发现自己物质丰富 士气低下
We find ourselves rich in goods but ragged in spirit.

40
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,320
雄心勃勃地想要登月
Reaching with magnificent precision for the moon

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,570
却在地球上陷入一片混乱
but falling into raucous discord on earth.

42
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,700
我们想要和平 却被卷入战争
We are caught at war wanting peace.

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,200
我们想要团结 却四分五裂
We're torn by division wanting unity.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
这个巨大的土星号火箭
This giant Saturn rocket

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,960
以及这里的其他设备 最初都是这场竞赛的一部分
and the rest of the equipment here began as part of a race

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,960
(国家航空航天局预算削减)

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,210
为的是战胜苏联人 它们肩负着
to beat the Russians with the national goal

48
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,840
我国在这个十年内把人类送上月球的目标
of putting a man on the moon in this decade.

49
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,220
但登月之旅的花费将超出所有人的预期
But their trip will cost more than anyone thought it would.

50
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,260
而在1960年代成功登月的几率愈加渺茫
And their chances of landing on the moon in the 1960s are increasingly slim.

51
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,060
(国家航空航天局)

52
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,870
斯图 你当主管第一周 听着情况不妙啊
First week as manager, Stu. Doesn't sound like it's going great.

53
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,920
要么是计量表不准 要么是某个储存罐漏了
So either our meters are off or there's a breach in one of the tanks.

54
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,880
但这种情况没有规程 我们也找不到泄漏源头
But there's no protocol for this. And we can't source the leak

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,420
因为是液态... 液态氢
because it's liquid hyd... Liquid hydrogen.

56
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,840
它是无色无味的 所有人都出去 快
It's colorless and odorless. Everybody out! Let's go!

57
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,420
里德 凯尔 放下铅笔
Reed, Kyle, pencils down.

58
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,720
可能已经在燃烧了 我们却不知情 找门出去
It could be burning, and we wouldn't know it. Find a door.

59
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,760
快 跑起来 别慢吞吞的
Come on! Run, run! No walking.

60
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,520
他在干什么? 打扫吗?
What's he doing? Is he cleaning?

61
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,480
不... 这是... 一种检查泄漏的老办法
No, no. It's an... It's an old-school leak detection process.

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,570
他用的是把扫帚
It's a broom.

63
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,610
斯图 你很聪明的 再想想 干麦秆加上液态氢等于...
Stu, you're better than this. Come on. Straw plus liquid hydrogen equals...

64
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,580
好 没事了 别担心了 来吧
All right, we're good! Don't worry about it. Come on.

65
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,040
我们还有工作呢 快点
We got work to do. Let's go.

66
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,640
新的规程是用扫帚检查泄漏
Uh, the new protocol is the broom method.

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,640
我们需要一把新扫帚
We need a new broom.

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,980
我刚才真以为他死了
I for sure thought he was dead.

69
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,440
拜托
Come on.

70
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,160
这还是
It's still broke

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,410
你上次发脾气时弄坏的 是的 我能看出来
from the last time you were in a mood. Yeah, I can see that.

72
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,410
波音又来电话了 亨利 打给议会 别找我
Boeing called again. Call Congress, Henry, not me.

73
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,790
我没有他们的电话号码
I don't have their number.

74
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,290
每天... 这里都有东西坏掉
Every day, every day, something is breaking around here.

75
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,420
或者爆炸 我们资金不足 人手不足
Or blowing up. We're underfunded, under... understaffed.

76
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,760
但没错 他们还期望我们吊打苏联人
But yeah, we're still expected to beat the pants off the Russians.

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,260
你能告诉我到底该怎么做到吗?
You mind telling me how the hell we're supposed to do that?

78
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,720
就从善待自动售货机开始吧
Could start by being a little nicer to the vending machines.

79
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,430
快看 在那里
Ooh! There it is!

80
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,930
什么? 有一只猫
What? There's a cat.

81
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,810
那又怎么了? 是一只黑猫 亨利 代表霉运
So what? It's a black cat, Henry. It's bad luck.

82
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,360
好吧 不见了
Okay, it's gone.

83
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,490
好 谢天谢地 好吧 我们走
All right. Thank God. Okay. Let's go.

84
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,740
叫保安 不要
Call security. I won't.

85
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,070
我不叫 这... 你要去叫
I will not. It... Yes, you will.

86
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,740
我们这里最不该出现的就是一只黑猫
The last thing that we need around here is a black cat.

87
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,700
保安又不管这种事
They don't deal with things like this.

88
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,410
他们管的 现在管了
Yes, they do. They do now.

89
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,960
你反应过头了 不 是你反应迟钝
Y-You're overreacting. No, you're not overreacting enough.

90
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,800
立刻叫保安 马上去
Call 'em right now. Right now.

91
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,140
我看起来如何?
How do I look?

92
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
容光焕发 加油
You're glowing. Good luck.

93
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,610
下午好 小伙子们
Good afternoon, boys.

94
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,480
走错房间了 亲爱的 我们不需要笔录
Wrong room, sweetheart. We don't need dictation.

95
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,440
我叫凯莉·琼斯 今天的会议由我主持
I'm Kelly Jones. I'll be running the meeting today.

96
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,400
你们一定是菲尔·亨利 尼尔·布朗和...
You must be Phil Hunley, Neil Brown and...

97
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,320
扎克·坦纳 不介意我坐下吧?
Ooh. [chuckles] Zack Tanner. You don't mind if I sit down, do you?

98
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,450
恕我直言 琼斯太太 我们是一家进步的公司
Uh, all due respect, Mrs. Jones, we're a progressive company.

99
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,160
我们的速记员团队有16名女性
We employ 16 women in our steno pool.

100
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,250
我们向男人出售跑车 出售300马力...
We're selling sports cars to men. We're selling a 300 horsepower...

101
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,300
355马力 你们卖的是7014CC排量 V8引擎的猛兽
355, 428 cubic inch V-8 beast is what you're selling.

102
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,380
你们要着重推销车的速度 比如这个
You want to focus on the car's speed. Something like this.

103
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:58,100
眼熟吗? 雪佛兰科迈罗 庞蒂亚克火鸟 还有奥斯莫比尔
Look familiar? Chevy Camaro. Pontiac Firebird. And Oldsmobile.

104
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,470
都是上个月的
All from last month.

105
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,980
幸好你们有些竞争对手没有的东西
Thankfully, you have something that your competition doesn't have.

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,230
野马Fastback “给他355马力 给家人安全带”
The Mustang Fastback. "355 horses for him. Seat belts for the family."

107
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,360
安全带? 我们安装安全带 只是因为明年可能会有强制安装的规定
The seat belts? We only put them in because they might be mandatory next year.

108
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,780
我们来做个游戏吧
Let's play a game.

109
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,660
我来猜你们几位先生分别驾驶什么车
Now I'm gonna guess what kind of car each one of you gentlemen drive.

110
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,760
扎克 1966年款福特野马敞篷车 罂粟红色的
Zack, Ford Mustang '66 convertible. It's poppy red.

111
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,350
不过你们当了老公的人不会开野马 尼尔开林肯大陆
Oh, no Mustangs for you husbands though. A Lincoln Continental for Neil.

112
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,440
可怜的菲尔开客货两用车 菲尔 你知道我每天什么时候最开心吗?
A station wagon for poor Phil. Oh, Phil. You know what the best part of my day is?

113
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,940
是我老公查理晚上回家时
When my husband Charlie comes home at night.

114
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,280
我无法想像他有一天晚上不回家会怎样
I can't even imagine what it would be like if-if one night he... he didn't.

115
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,200
你来想像一下这段对话
Now imagine the conversation

116
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,450
如果有人跟你老婆说这辆车
if someone told your wife that this car,

117
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,170
拥有355马力和169公里的最高时速
its 355 horses and 105 top speed,

118
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:10,840
正是这辆车每天晚上 载着她老公安全回到家人身边
this car is what brings her husband home safe to her family every night.

119
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,840
她希望你拥有这辆车
Now she wants you to have it.

120
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,550
她说出每个已婚男士梦想听到的话
She says the words every married man dreams of hearing...

121
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,140
“如果你买下这辆野马
"I'd feel so much better

122
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,890
我会感觉比现在更幸福 亲爱的”
if you bought yourself that Mustang, sweetheart."

123
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,940
你怎么猜到他们开什么车的?
How did you guess what kind of cars they drive?

124
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,030
贿赂了他们的秘书还是怎样?
What, bribe their secretaries or something?

125
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
凯莉 真的假的
Kelly, seriously?

126
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,700
两包维珍妮牌女士香烟和一瓶帕科香水
Two packs of Virginia Slims and a bottle of Paco Rabanne.

127
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,620
每个人都是有价的
Everyone has their price.

128
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,540
幸好刚才我的羊水没破 天啊
I'm just lucky that my water didn't break in there. Oh, God.

129
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
嗨 罗恩 你老婆好吗?
Hi, Ron. How's the wife?

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,750
(创意总监 凯莉·琼斯)

131
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,090
听着 假肚子只能干洗
Now, the baby bump, dry-clean only.

132
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,590
好的 我记下了 还有 欧米茄确认了下周的安排
Yes, I have that noted. A-Also, Omega confirmed for next week,

133
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,800
我完成了芭斯·罗缤的画
I finished the Baskin-Robbins artwork,

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,510
Palmex那个人问你的地址 想给你送玫瑰
and that guy from Palmex asked for your address to send roses,

135
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,720
但我给了他我的 我知道
but I gave him mine because I know

136
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,890
你对玫瑰的看法 你知道我对玫瑰的看法
how you feel about roses. You know how I feel about roses.

137
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,270
还有 约翰又来电了 他想在星期二带你去吃晚餐
Also, John called. Again. He wants to take you to dinner Tuesday.

138
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,980
告诉他我搬到洛杉矶去了 给陶氏化学的布鲁斯打电话
Tell him I moved to LA. And call Bruce from Dow Chemical.

139
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,400
我听说他们在给密保诺密封袋找新代理
I hear they're looking for a new agency for Ziploc.

140
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,860
人们应该抵制陶氏化学 他们做凝固汽油弹
People should be boycotting Dow. They make napalm.

141
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,530
人们嘴上说着抵制 但还是在买装三文治的袋子
People say they're boycotting, but they're still buying sandwich bags.

142
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,410
他们还卖保鲜膜和泡沫塑料
They also sell Saran Wrap and Styrofoam.

143
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,410
你认为人们会停止使用泡沫塑料吗? 你的咖啡用什么装的?
Think people are going to stop using Styrofoam? What's your coffee in?

144
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,120
听着 我知道你和你的朋友们想拯救世界
Now, I know you and your friends want to save the world,

145
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,670
但等到你在1984年当上这里的主管
and by the time you're running this place in 1984,

146
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,500
世上已经没有核弹 全体人类平权了
there's gonna be no nukes and equal rights for all.

147
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,630
但在那之前 我们得干好本职工作
But until then, we've got a job to do.

148
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,430
凯莉... 我们有大麻烦了
Kelly! Kelly! Kelly. Kelly. We've got a big problem.

149
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,060
我刚刚愤怒地离开片场 对 我有充分的理由
I just stormed off set, and, yes, it was justified.

150
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,640
我没法跟胡佛这些人合作
I cannot work with these Hoover people.

151
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,150
显然他们对我给他们拍广告的方式有意见
Apparently, they have issues with the way that I am shooting their commercial.

152
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,360
他们真是这么说的 “他们的” 那可是我的广告
They actually said that. "Their." It's my commercial.

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,030
不就是做吸尘器的嘛 我可是搞艺术的
They make vacuums. I make art.

154
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,900
抱歉 我们约了见面吗? 没有...
Sorry, did we have a meeting set? No. No.

155
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,820
不好意思 我没意识到还得约时间
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I had to set a time

156
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,320
才能跟最亲爱的朋友说话
to speak to one of my dearest friends.

157
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,740
上次我们说话时你把我炒了 我现在不为你工作了
The last time we spoke, you fired me. And I don't work for you.

158
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,040
我跟你讲 凯莉 我不是来听你训斥的
You know what, Kelly, I didn't come in here to be berated.

159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,120
我是来找你支持我的
I came in to be agreed with!

160
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,830
你十分钟后要向雀巢推销 这很重要
You have that Nestle pitch in ten. Very important.

161
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,710
骗人的 再见
That is a lie. Goodbye.

162
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,460
兰斯 给你拿到这份导演工作 堪称圣诞奇迹
Lance, getting you this directing gig was a Christmas miracle.

163
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,050
你搞砸了那个果冻广告拍摄后 我用了三周时间
It took me three weeks to convince them that you were stable

164
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,840
才说服他们你并非喜怒无常 果冻广告那事不怪我
after your Jell-O shoot from hell. Jell-O was not my fault.

165
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,470
那个演员... 才五岁 你把他弄哭了
Ugh. That actor wa... Was five. You made him cry.

166
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,930
我是帮了那孩子一把 好莱坞可不好混
Well, I did that child a favor. Hollywood is no cakewalk.

167
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,520
那亨氏食品广告呢? 你超了预算四万块 只是个番茄酱广告而已
What about the Heinz commercial? You went 40,000 over budget. It was about ketchup.

168
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,360
才不是 重点是番茄酱带来的希望
It was not about ketchup. It was about the promise of ketchup.

169
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,730
没有人看到我在为他们的产品做什么
No one sees what I'm doing for their products.

170
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,990
我在提升产品价值
I am elevating them.

171
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,360
我现在应该在拍电影了
I should be in film by now.

172
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,030
我拒绝了执导《娃娃谷》的机会
I passed on directing Valley of the Dolls.

173
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,160
那事怪我 但我还是该拍电影 好了 我们是怎么称呼你的?
That is on me, but still. Now, what do we call you, right?

174
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,950
广告界的库布里克 好了 天啊 斯坦利是半吊子
The Kubrick of commercials. All right. Oh, my God. Stanley is a hack.

175
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,000
拍出一部好电影就突然成了天才
He does one good movie, and suddenly he's a genius.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,540
你是传奇 好吗? 创意天才
You are a legend, right? Creative genius.

177
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,130
但你也脾气暴躁 反覆无常 永远不能按预算拍摄
You're also hotheaded, mercurial and can't stick to a budget for shit.

178
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,010
谢谢 这不是夸你
Oh, thank you. That wasn't a compliment.

179
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,590
这时就该当耳旁风 你若不跟胡佛合作 以后就没人请你了
It is when you stop listening. If you quit Hoover, you'll be unhirable.

180
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,260
好吧
Okay.

181
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,850
兰斯 不如你回片场吧
Lance, why don't you march your ass back to set,

182
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,600
不管发什么脾气 都道个歉 好吗?
and you apologize for whatever fit you threw, okay?

183
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,440
给你男朋友买个棒棒的圣诞礼物 谢谢他容忍你
Buy your boyfriend something nice for Christmas for putting up with you.

184
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,810
也给我买个礼物 好吗?
Get something for me too, okay?

185
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,360
圣诞快乐 兰斯 圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas, Lance. Merry Christmas.

186
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,690
请你给我找份像样的工作 好吗?
Can you get me a decent job, please?

187

阿波罗8号于今早成功发射
Apollo 8 launched successfully this morning.

188

这场胜利是国家航空航天局的及时雨 在越南方面 今天有更多人牺牲
A much needed win for NASA. In Vietnam, more men were lost today.

189
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,040
(阿波罗8号发射录影)

190
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,870
二千五百万公里...
And 15 million miles...

191
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,460
麻烦再来一杯 另外把晚餐菜单拿给我

我们吃鸡好了 她对牡蛎过敏
We'll do the chicken. She's allergic to oysters.

195
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,390
给我来一杯麦卡伦 一个柠檬和一个砧板
And I'll take a shot of Macallan, a lemon and a cutting board.

Yes, sir. Oh, I'm sorry. Do I know you?

跑车上装安全带 这个点子很不错
Seat belts in a sports car. I mean, that's a great angle.

198
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,450
很不幸 他们即将停止跟你合作
Unfortunately, they're about to kill the account.

199
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,620
为什么?
Why would they do that?

200
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,330
因为有人告诉他们 你肚子里其实没孩子
Because someone told them that you don't really have a bun in the oven.

201
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,500
菲尔 让我解释一下

我以后再也不会相信女人了
That's the last time I trust a woman.

我还给你送了一份婴儿礼物
I actually sent you a baby gift.

204
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,180
你那么做非常贴心 请让我...

尼尔 让我解释一下 如果你们...
Neil, let-let me explain. If you...

206
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,300
怎么回事? 你为谁工作? 奥美广告?
What is this? Who do you work for, Ogilvy?

207
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,180
你业绩拼不过我 就害我被解雇?
Huh? You can't outsell me, so you got me fired?

208
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,440
恰恰相反 我想聘请你
Just the opposite. I wanna hire you.

209
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,060
我叫莫·伯克斯 在总统办公室工作

213
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,670

So I did a little digging, and, uh...

214
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,460
你的经历很有趣 凯莉
You have quite a colorful past, Kelly.

215
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,340
还是说我该叫你简? 来自芝加哥的空姐
Or should I call you Jane? Stewardess from Chicago.

216
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,260

Or perhaps you would prefer Amy, the nurse from Ohio.

217
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,230
有这么漂亮的脸蛋 谁还会看推荐信?
Face like that, who's gonna check references?

218

你找的那一页不在这里
Page you're looking for isn't in there.

219

我不知道你在说什么

嘿 我也有几十个身份证 我的真名也不叫莫
Hey, I have dozens of IDs, and my real name's not Moe.

222
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,160
有那么多名字可以选 你却挑了“莫”?
With all the names you could've picked, you landed on Moe?

223
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,710
你天赋出众
You have singular talent.

224
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,460
可以用来成就更伟大的事业 何必浪费在卖车上呢?
Why waste it selling cars when you can think bigger?

225
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,300
莫 有什么公司比福特更伟大?
Well, Moe, what's bigger than Ford?

226
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,850

他们想让你推销月球? 月球 阿波罗任务

一整套
The whole thing.

229
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,900
这个叫莫的家伙为国家航空航天局做事?
And this Moe guy works for NASA?

230
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,450
对 不 算是吧 他是政府的人
Yeah. I mean, y... Well, no. Um, kind of. He-He-He works for the government.

231
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,530
哪个部门?
Oh, which part?

232
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
凯莉
Kelly?

233
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,290
这个人... 我们在为理查德·尼克松工作?
Does this guy... Are we working for Richard Nixon?

234
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,790
因为我才不会为理查德·尼克松工作 凯莉
Because, Kelly, I will not work for Richard Nixon.

235
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,840
我是持证女权主义者 我真的有证
I'm a card-carrying feminist. I actually have a card.

236
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,710
我甚至不相信他要当总统了
I can't even believe he's going to be president.

237
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,300
我本来不知道自己对美国有这么多意见
I had no idea I disagreed with this much of the country.

238
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,930
我们为国家航空航天局工作 推销月球 没人对月球有意见
We are working for NASA to sell the moon. Nobody disagrees about the moon.

239
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,720
不是 你我都清楚
No. You and I both know

240
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,890
我们身边每天都有可怕的事发生
that everywhere around us every day something terrible is happening.

241
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,060
无所不在

除了太空
Except in space.

243
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,610
真讨厌 你说动我了 他们绝对需要我们的帮助
I hate that this is working on me. They definitely need our help.

244
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,860
你知道国家航空航天局的头29次任务 只有48%的成功率吗?
Did you know of NASA's first 29 missions, only 48% have been successful?

245
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,860
这不可能 太离谱了
That can't be. That's crazy.

246
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,950
你知道可可海滩市的 男女比例是五比一吗? 天啊
Did you know the ratio of men to women in Cocoa Beach is 5-to-1? [chuckles] Wow.

247
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,580
只要你给我们找的住处不在兄弟会街就行
As long as you got us a quiet place that's not on Frat Row.

248

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,720
你被炒鱿鱼了
You're fired.

251
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,770
这些都是什么人啊?
Who are all these people?

你怎么会认为我是宇航员?
What makes you think I'm an astronaut?

282
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,220
因为你戴着阿波罗胸针 只有宇航员才有

I didn't mean it for it to... Uh. That's okay. No. You were being honest.

290
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,540
你点的餐好了 科尔
Order up, Cole. Um...

291
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,230

I wasn't being honest. If I was being honest,

292
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,440
我会跟你说 你是我记忆中

All I really want to do is just buy you a drink and talk to you for hours,

296
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,540

379
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,420
你们有谁会用灭火器吗?
Do either of you know how to work a fire extinguisher?

380
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,630
不会? 好吧 四步口诀 很简单
No? Mkay. PASS method's pretty simple.

381
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,970
拔安全销 对准火焰 压下把手 喷向火焰
Just, uh, pull the pin, aim, squeeze, sweep.

382
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,220
如果你们有任何其他需要
If you need anything else,

383
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,390
可以回纽约去拿 祝你们愉快
uh, maybe just go back to New York and get it. Have a good day.

384
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,600
至少他还算养眼 但说话很刺耳
Well, at least he's easy on the eyes. He's hard on the ears though.

385
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,190
欢迎仪式很烂啊 我以为你说他们想要我们帮忙呢
Not a great welcome wagon. I thought you said they wanted our help.

386
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,690
不 我说他们需要我们帮忙 这一点现在已经实锤到不能再实锤
Oh, no. I said they needed our help. And I do believe that now more than ever.

387
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,070
如果我们谁都不能谈或什么都不能看
How are we supposed to do that if we can't talk to anyone

388
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,570
那要怎么帮忙?
or look at anything?

389
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,490
是一只猫...
Aw, it's a cat. It's a cat.

390
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,780
是一只猫 是一只猫
It's a cat! It's a cat.

391
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,790
你知道关于黑猫的说法吗?
You know what they say about black cats?

392
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,750
如果黑猫从你面前路过 可能是要去其他地方
If they cross your path, they're probably going someplace else.

393
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,340
好 该把旧名片夹翻出来了
Okay, time to dig out the old Rolodex.

394
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,420
创意时间到
Let's get creative.

395
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,490
阿波罗11号将把我们的人送上月球
Apollo 11 will land our men on the moon,

396
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,240
这会让我们成为世界第一
and that makes us first.

397
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,740
如果我们完成工作 将会在那里发射
If we do our jobs, we will launch right from there,

398
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,000
时间是7月16日一大早
July 16, bright and early.

399
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,620
在那之前
Between now and then,

400
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,500
我们要完成人类历史上
we will piece together the biggest jigsaw puzzle

401
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,590
最大的拼图
in the history of mankind.

402
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,460
六百万个零部件散落在全国各地
Six million parts spread out around the country,

403
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,680
我们要对每一个零件 进行组装 测试 再测试
and we will assemble, test, and retest every single one

404
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,220
直到我们确定阿波罗11号 可以万无一失地发射
until we are certain that Apollo 11 will take off

405
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,180
并飞向月球 就在...
without a hitch and head to the moon in...

406
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,770
亨利 你说
Henry, sing it.

407
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,640
在七个月后
Seven months. Huh?

408
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,940
七个月后
Seven months.

409
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,480
请帮我恭喜阿波罗11号的宇航员
Please help me congratulate the astronauts of Apollo 11.

阿姆斯特朗 奥尔德林和柯林斯
Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins.

411
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,330
嘿... 伙计们 你们觉得白宫怎么样?
Hey, hey! How'd you like the White House, boys? Huh?

412
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,920
(月球 我们来了)

413
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,510
还不错 只可惜尼尔不让我偷那里的瓷器
Yeah, it was all right, except Neil wouldn't let me steal the china.

414
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:39,550
好 因为在八个月后 等这一切都结束
All right. Because in eight months, when this is all over,

415
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,220
他们需要新历史书 来记载我们在这里取得的成就时
and they need new history books to cover what we've accomplished here,

416
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,180
你们每一个人都能说
each and every single one of you will be able to say that

417
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,110
“我做了有史以来最困难的事” 对吗?
"I did the hardest thing that has ever been done." Yeah?

418
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,150
对
Yeah!

419
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,070

你说新来的女士 只要做任何你不喜欢的事就通知你
you said to tell you when the new lady did anything you wouldn't like.

423
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,790
我身处肯尼迪航天中心
I'm here at the Kennedy Space Center

424
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,000
有幸采访到副发射主管亨利·斯莫尔斯
with Deputy Launch Director, Henry Smalls.

425
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,920

What's going on? That's my name. He's got my name and my job!

这段时间对我们所有人来说都很美好 对我来说更具个人感情
It's been a great time for all of us. You know, for me, this is very personal.

427

我父亲是一位空军士兵
My father was an airman...

428
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,510
这是谁啊?
Who is that?

429
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,890
反正不是我 他在服役时牺牲了
It's not me. he died in the line of duty

430
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,850
当时我还是个孩子 我没那么帅
when I was a child... I'm not that handsome.

431
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,020

真是够了 听到这个我很遗憾

Thanks for sharing. That must've been... My dad's still alive.

434
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,690

在公众眼里 他是亨利·斯莫尔斯
To the world, that's Henry Smalls.

445
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,800
他不是亨利·斯莫尔斯
That's not Henry Smalls.

446
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,850
对 但你跟我说你们不接受采访
No, but you told me that your guys don't do interviews,

447
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,180
所以我只能另请新人
so I had to hire new guys.

448
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,810
你让两位全球最顶尖的工程师装窗户
You have two of the best engineers on the planet installing a window.

Phil, if you hammer one more time, I swear to God I'm gonna lose my mind.

450
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,440
把锤子放下 摘掉该死的工具带
Put down the hammer, take your stupid belts off

451
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,650
回去测试
and get back to testing.

452
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,700
动起来 走了
On the move. Here we go.

453
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,280
这景色绝了吧?
Can you believe that view?

454
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,660
我们拿到了阿波罗8号的第一批照片 比我的好
We got the first photos from Apollo 8. It's better than mine.

455

The first shot of the earth from the moon.

456
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,000
这是不是你见过最美的东西?
Isn't that the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?

457
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,120
你怎么比我先拿到? 他们称之为“地出”
How'd you get this before me? They're calling it "Earthrise."

458
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,250
这张照片会登上今晚所有新闻的头条
It's going to be at the top of every news segment tonight.

459
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,000
1968年太糟糕了
I mean, '68 has been such a terrible year.

460
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,170
刺杀 可憎的战争 我们见证了人类最丑恶的一面
Assassinations, this heinous war, we've seen the worst of humanity.

461
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,430
这时国家航空航天局公布这张照片 一个看世界的全新视角
Now NASA gives us this? A whole new way to see the world.

462
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,390
我会确保所有人都看到
And I'm gonna make sure everybody sees it.

463
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,270

Who's he? You. You're a juicy part.

466
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,280
要拍这几场戏 这里是角色生平
So, here's the scenes and the character bio.

467
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,780
你要扮演的就是这位 所以最好提升一点魅力
This is the man that you're playing, so you wanna up the charisma a bit.

468
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,160
好 我会提升... 明白? 好
Can do. I'll up the... Okay? Okay.

470
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,790
我很荣幸 我在朝鲜飞过52次任务
It's an honor. I flew 52 missions in Korea.

471
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,870
我取了个整数
I rounded up.

472
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,090
“我在朝鲜飞过52次任务” 怎么样?
"I flew 52 missions in Korea." How was that?

473
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,760
什么? 我会练习一下的
What? I'll work on it.

474
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,260
她现在都找好人冒充我了

她已经有了个假的我 她有个假的我 假的你
She got a fake me. She got a fake me and a fake you.

476
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,720
不能冒充你和我 一无所获
You can't fake me and you. There's nothing here.

477
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,690
没有莫·伯克斯 我每个字都看过了
There's no Moe Berkus. I checked every spelling.

478
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,400
有个叫莫·伯克斯的打来电话
I have a Moe Berkus on the line.

479
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,230
要我来说吗? 不... 我会很享受的
Do you want me to talk? Oh, no, no. I'm gonna enjoy this.

480
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,900
这将是国家航空航天局史上最快速的解雇
This is gonna be the fastest firing in NASA's history.

481
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,280
嗨 莫 科尔 我听说你在找我
Hey, Moe. Cole, I hear you're looking for me.

482
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,700
是的 凯莉·琼斯 聘请了演员来假扮国家航空航天局工程师
I am. Kelly Jones hired actors to play NASA engineers.

483
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,120
这是不可接受的 我要她今天就走人
It is unacceptable. I want her desk cleared today.

484
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,290
冷静点... 好吗?
Calm, calm, calm down, okay?

485
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,340
华盛顿的政要们会看电视 阿波罗现在上电视了
Washington watches TV. Apollo is now on TV.

486
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,590
每个频道 每天都播
Every channel, every day.

487
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,260
你们想登月吗?
So, you want to get to the moon?

488
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,550
我建议你们专心做好本职工作
I suggest, focus on your job.

489
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,930
也让凯莉做好本职工作
Let Kelly do hers.

490
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,020
如果她把你打造成舞会上的焦点
If she's made you the belle of the ball,

491
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,400
你不妨穿上芭蕾舞裙来跳一段
why don't you just slip on your tutu and do some dancing?

492
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,700
炒掉她了?
She fired? Mm-mmm.

493
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,580
我们被炒了?
Are we fired?

494
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,380
阿波罗8号载着宇航员 博尔曼 洛弗尔和安德斯
Apollo 8, carrying astronauts Borman, Lovell and Anders

495
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,840
由土星5号送入了太空
was launched into space by a Saturn V.

496
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,590
每一个电视网都在播放地出照片
Every single network is airing the Earthrise shot.

497
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,550
会传遍世界各地
I mean, it's... it's gonna be everywhere.

498
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,470
我试着画了几笔
You know, I tried a little something on it,

499
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,390
但好像效果还不行 不够吸引人 我们需要一个关联
but I just don't think it's working yet. It's not enough. We need a hook,

500
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,060
一个把登月和人们日常生活挂钩的方法
a way to weave the moon landing into people's everyday lives

501
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,600
还得潜移默化
without them realizing it.

502
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,690
嗨 你们有类似沙拉的东西吗?
Uh, hi. Do you have anything close to a salad?

503
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,270
汉堡上的腌黄瓜
Pickles come on a burger.

504
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,860
不过要等一等 阿波罗的新闻一出 生意变好了
It's gonna be a minute, though. Apollo news has business picking up.

505
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,740
有很多游客想来亲眼见证历史
All the tourists love to come in and see little pieces of history.

506
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,410
见证历史? 对 比如那支笔
Pieces of history? Yeah, like... like that pen.

507
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,620
1961年 约翰·格伦每晚都来这里用餐
John Glenn ate here every night in '61.

508
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,620
(沃尔菲上太空了)

509
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,370
他用我们的一支笔来写飞行手册
He would work on his flight manuals, and he'd use one of our pens.

510
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,790
那支笔上过水星6号
That one ended up on Mercury 6.

511
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,300
这里是全世界唯一一家 名字上过太空的餐厅
You're at the only restaurant in the world whose name's been in space.

512
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,420
很酷
That's cool.

513
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,180
正前方
And right up ahead,

514
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,930
是著名的水星火箭
it's the famous Mercury rockets.

515
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,940
一定要在这里拍照 但别站太近
Be sure to get a picture here, but don't stand too close.

516
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,360
火箭可能会发射
They might go off.

517
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,740
那个周末过后 他就恢复了
He recovered after that weekend.

518
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,740
(你能准备好吗? 距离发射还有171天)

519
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,490
你每次进房间 大家都会安静下来 你感到困扰吗?
Does it bother you that a room dies every time you walk into it?

520
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,240
你该待在你那边的
You're supposed to stay on your side.

521
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,040
我想你了
I missed you. Hmm.

522
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,790
我希望你批准我们新的推广活动
I'd like you to approve our new ad campaigns.

523
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,710
你不如就像上次一样先斩后奏吧
Why don't you just sidestep me like you did last time?

524
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,710
我想为那些让你措手不及的采访道歉
I wanna apologize for blindsiding you with the interviews.

525
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,420
我有办法解决我们的资金问题
I have a fix for our money problems.

526
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,260
我不接受你的道歉 也不接受这些莫名奇妙的东西
Well, your apology is rejected, and so is whatever this is.

527
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,680
欧米茄 听着 这里不是麦迪逊大道
Omega. Look, this isn't Madison Avenue.

528
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,850
我们不会为这种东西买单 不 免费的
We don't pay for this stuff. No, it's cost-free.

529
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,810
品牌方能得到钱都买不到的合作机会
The brands get a tie-in money can't buy,

530
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,690
而国家航空航天局 可以潜移默化去影响普通人
and NASA works its way into the minds of everyday people.

531
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,230
手表广告? 这就是你的绝妙点子?
A watch ad? That's-That's your big idea?

532
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,730
准备好了?
Ready? Mm-hmm.

533
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,820
牙膏
Toothpaste.

534
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,360
果珍 “阿波罗宇航员选择的 能量早餐饮品
Tang. "The energy breakfast drink chosen for Apollo astronauts

535
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,660
专供登月之旅使用” 月球优惠券?
on their trip to the moon." Moon coupons?

536
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,660
但我个人最喜欢的要属这个
But, my personal favorite,

537
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,750
鲜果布衣 是吧?
Fruit of the Loom. Right?

538
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,290
宇航员在太空服里面总得穿点什么吧?
The guys gotta wear something under those big suits, don't they?

539
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,960
鲜果布衣真的太能代表航天局了
Nothing says NASA like Fruit of the Loom.

540
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,460
听着 我不会把飞船变成飞行广告牌
Look, I am not turning this ship into a flying billboard

541
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,380
无论你多么渴望都不行
no matter how much you want it to happen.

542
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,130
还有 我们没时间在发射前测试这些东西
And by the way, we don't have time to test all this before liftoff.

543
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,720
我们不必真的把这些送上太空 只要说说就好
We don't have to send any of this up into space as long as we say it went.

544
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,140
所以你打算撒谎?
Oh, so you're gonna lie?

545
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,100
这叫推销 我们不会欺骗顾客
It's called selling. We're not lying to the customer.

546
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,310
我们在改变他们的思维方式 不 这叫撒谎
We're changing the way they think. No, it's called lying.

547
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,230
所有人在你眼里都只是顾客吗?
Everyone is just a customer to you, huh?

548
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,770
听着 我知道你是个厉害的广告精英
Look, I know that you're a big old fancy ad shark and everything,

549
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,990
但国家航空航天局 不是能用广告曲和广告词推销的
but NASA's not something that you sell with a jingle and a slogan.

550
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,400
你不知道我们是谁
You do not know who we are.

551
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,950
行 好吧 玛格丽特·汉密尔顿是谁?
Yeah, okay. Who's Margaret Hamilton?

552
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,990
谁? 她是你的手下
Who? She works here for you.

553
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,410
有四十万人和太空计划有关
There are 400,000 people that are affiliated

554
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,910
琼斯女士 她是你的工程师之一
with this space program, Ms. Jones. She's one of your engineers.

555
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,120
乔安·摩根是谁? 她是点火室的
Who's JoAnn Morgan? She works in the firing room.

556
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,170
你问过她当初为什么接这份工作吗? 我就问过
Did you ever ask her why she took this job in the first place? I have.

557
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,340
她说因为她的血液里流的都是火箭燃料
She says it's because she has rocket fuel in her blood.

558
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,510
国家航空航天局不光是个标志 也代表着人民
And NASA's not just a logo, it's people.

559
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,010
那些每天早上醒来
People who wake up every morning

560
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,600
决心创造奇迹的人
and commit to accomplishing the impossible.

561
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,600
同时跟大家穿着一样的内衣
And all while wearing the same underwear as the rest of us.

562
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,190
艾拉 你有任何需要吗?
Ella, can I help you with anything at all?

563
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,070
谢谢
Thank you.

564
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,320
我预估了一下 如果你接受关键赞助
So I ran the projections, and this is what you stand to make

565
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,240
能赚到这个数
if you accept key sponsorships.

566
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,500
我们不能收私人的钱
We-We can't take private money.

567
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,370
无所谓的 明白吗?
It doesn't matter, okay?

568
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,170
我即将让航天局变得非常受欢迎
I'm about to make NASA so popular

569
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,000
国会终将重新提供资金
that Congress will finally turn the taps back on around here.

570
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,630
我只需让阿姆斯特朗 戴上一块欧米茄手表就行?
And all I have to do is just let Armstrong put on an Omega watch?

571
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,180
不 如果我们得到资金
No. If we get the money flowing,

572
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,680
那你必须向我证明
then you've gotta prove to me

573
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,010
可可海滩也有不错的地方可以吃晚餐
that Cocoa Beach has a decent place to get dinner.

574
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,070
成交 我... 好 成交 太好了 呜呼
Deal. I... Yes! Deal! Yes! Whoo!

575
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,740
不 等等 我得设置底线 手纸不行
Uh, no, wait. I'm drawing the line at toilet paper though,

576
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,700
因为世人不用知道我们的人用什么擦屁股
because the world does not get to know what our guys wipe their ass with.

577
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,570
真臭
Well, shit.

578
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,460
你返回地球后想去度假吗?
Would you like to go for a vacation when you come back to earth?

579
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,130
根据目前的情况看
The situation being what it is now,

580
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,550
我最可能去的地方...
the place I would most like to go, uh...

581
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,050
下次把桌子撤掉 沃尔特
Lose the table next time, Walter.

582
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,800
尼尔看起来 像在做通用电气的季度盈利报告
Neil looks like he's giving GE's quarterly profit report.

583
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,550
我们一直用这张桌...
That's always been our table...

584
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,430
电视让他们走进人们的起居室
TV brings them in to people's living rooms.

585
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,010
他们应该看起来像家中的客人
They should look like they belong there.

586
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,560
那意味着我们成功了
It'd mean that we succeeded.

587
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,690
你还是负责人 沃尔特 别担心
You're still in charge, Walter. Don't you worry.

588
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,730
不过等我帮完忙后
When I'm done helping though,

589
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,860
这些人会比披头士乐队还火
those men are gonna be bigger than The Beatles.

590
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,490
我可以完成99.9%的登月之旅 我很满意
I'm getting to go 99.9% of the way there, and that suits me just fine.

591
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,990
(下一站 月球)

592
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,530
(阿波罗11号 最危险的航行)

593
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,000
家乐氏的那个副总叫什么? 应该是哈里森·德里斯科尔
What's the name of that VP at Kellogg's? I believe it's Harrison Driscoll.

594
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
(阿波罗登月在即)

595
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,750
好 哈里森
All right, Harrison.

596
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,300
不要用“辟啪 笑笑 泡泡” 改用“尼尔 巴兹和迈克” 不错吧?
So instead of "Snap, Crackle, Pop," "Neil, Buzz and Mike." It's cute, right?

597
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,600
科尔
Cole!

598
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,050
确保那个不会生锈 亨利 能签一下这些吗?
Make sure that doesn't rust, Henry. Can you mark these?

599
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,270
嘿... 你看见了吗?
Hey, hey. Did you see that?

600
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,440
你没看见那只猫?
You didn't see the cat?

601
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,950
果珍的瓶子再推近些
Go closer on the Tang bottle.

602
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,950
字体再大些 放上培根和鸡蛋
Make the font bigger and put bacon with the eggs.

603
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,370
别忘了 我们推销的是美国
Let's not forget, we're selling America, here.

604
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,330
“彼得潘花生酱 丝滑到飞起 此酱只应天上有”
"Peter Pan Peanut Butter. Peanut butter that's out-of-this-world smooth."

拉里 这是欧米茄的好机会
Larry, this is Omega's big chance.

607
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,680
在每一块超霸的背面 直到永远
On the back of every Speedmaster till the end of time,

608
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,470
(宇航员登上月球时将佩戴欧米茄手表)

609
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,390
“第一块被戴上月球的手表” 对吧?
"The first watch worn on the moon." Right?

610
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,060
现在我们得把它立起来
Now we just gotta stand her up.

611
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,310
一切都将是值得的
It's all gonna be worth it.

612
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,190
(美国靠阿波罗11号取得领先)

613
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,530
嘿... 你占了我的车位 我们在为凯莉布景
Hey. Hey! You're in my spot. We're setting up a shot for Kelly.

614
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,080
我们的阿波罗11号任务有三位宇航员
We've got three astronauts on the Apollo 11 mission.

615
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,750
他们站在三辆漂亮的美国汽车前
There they are in front of three beautiful American cars.

616
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,010
真棒
Oh, this is great.

617
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,550
你们必须立刻前往测试楼
You gotta be in the test facility right now.

618
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,510
跟凯莉说
Talk to Kelly.

619
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,390
凯莉说我们花1块就能开走科尔维特
Kelly said we could take a Corvette home for a dollar.

620
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,430
你来啦 1美元?
There you are. A dollar?

621
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,180
我需要占用他们15分钟而已
I'm gonna need them for 15 minutes, but that's all.

622
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,270
我15分钟前就需要他们了 凯莉
I needed them 15 minutes ago, Kelly.

623
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,560
你知道他们穿的宇航服有多贵吗?
You know how expensive those suits are?

624
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,940
别担心 他只是发射主管
Oh, don't worry. It's just the launch director.

625
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,980
登月舱的样子很怪 凯利先生 它的原理是什么?
This strange looking bird, the LEM, Mr. Kelly. How does it work?

626
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,280
这是让人
Well, this is a spacecraft that's used

627
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,240
着陆到月球表面的飞船
to take men down to the lunar surface.

628
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,740
登月舱里三位宇航员中的两位...
And two of the three astronauts in the LEM...

629
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,500
飞行指挥 我们错过了目标 正飘向广袤的虚空
Flight, we missed target and are drifting into the vast abyss.

630
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,050
我们死了 再来 是
And we're dead. Again. Yeah.

631
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,210
着陆前30秒耗尽了燃料
Ran out of fuel 30 seconds before touchdown.

632
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,510
是 但是着陆本身不错
Yeah, but the landing, though,

633
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,430
很顺利 很好 俯仰角度很好 继续
it was smooth... It was good. Great pitch. Forward.

634
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,890
你们俩撒谎的技术真烂
You're both bad liars.

635
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,470
尼尔 迈克 巴兹 能再为琼斯女士 和欧米茄多拍一张照片吗?
Neil, Mike, Buzz, if I can get one more photo for Ms. Jones and Omega?

636
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,560
哥们 你谁啊?
Who are you, man?

637
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,850
好 举起手表 小伙子们
All right, watches up, boys.

638
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,770
给欧米茄来个微笑
And smile for Omega.

639
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,530
我是戴维斯 我打扰到你了吗?
Davis. Am I interrupting?

640
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,790
一直在打扰 你面前应该有个盒子
Always. There should be a box in front of you.

641
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,620
不如打开看看?
Why don't you open it?

642
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,130
欧米茄感谢你的服务
Omega thanks you for your service.

643
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,880
你的宇航员们在电视上大出风头
Your boys are all over TV,

644
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,890
资金又开始流入了 所以... 共进晚餐?
the taps are flowing again. So... dinner?

645
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,890
好 卡纳维拉尔码头 5点
Yeah. Canaveral Pier. Five o'clock.

646
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
戴着手表来
Wear your watch.

647
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,360
下午3点是他们播放采访的 最佳时段 也是最后一个
3:00 p.m. is their best and final time slot to air the interview.

648
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,690
播阿姆斯特朗的独家采访? 下午3点是给小孩和闲人看的
For an exclusive with Armstrong? 3:00 p.m. is for children and deadbeats.

649
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,200
他们说有战争方面的突发新闻
They said they have breaking news from the war.

650
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,240
敌军规模未知
Unknown size enemy force.

651
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,620
敌军伤亡人数不详
Enemy casualties are unknown,

652
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,330
但大家都看到过到底是怎么回事
but you've seen how it really was.

653
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,460
让阿波罗任务一直有新闻的努力失败了
So much for keeping Apollo back in the news cycle.

654
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,920
英雄主义 危险 恐惧 全部融为一体
Heroism, danger, fear, all rolled into one.

655
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,670
无法用语言形容
Words don't describe it.

656
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,090
我是哥伦比亚广播公司新闻台的 理查德·思雷尔克德 柬埔寨边境附近报道
Richard Threlkeld, CBS News. Near the Cambodian border.

657
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,350
谢谢你 斯科蒂船长 感谢
Thank you, Captain Scotty. Appreciate you.

658
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,310
好
Okay.

659
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,220
你对女士可真是一毛不拔
Well, you spare no expense on a lady.

660
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,640
尝尝看嘛
Just try it.

661
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,100
虾 蛋黄酱 面包
Shrimp, mayo, bun.

662
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,860
这恰好是方圆百里之内最美味的一餐
And that happens to be the best meal in a hundred miles.

663
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,490
我没说错吧
Mmm. Told you.

664
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,740
我怎么不知道这地方?
How'd I not know about this place?

665
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,780
不是所有人都喜欢打广告
Not everybody likes to advertise.

666
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,200
说得妙 有两下子嘛
Nice one. That's good.

667
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,410
那是火箭发射的地方 就是那里
That's where the rocket will launch out of. Right there.

668
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,800
你戴那块手表戴可真好看 你戴着很合适
That watch looks great on you. You wear it very well.

669
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,180
谢谢
Thanks.

670
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,850
那天晚上我在酒吧里跟你说...
That night at the bar, what I said to you...

671
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,480
你的目光无法从我身上挪开
That you couldn't take your eyes off me,

672
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,860
我是你见过最美的女人
and I was the most beautiful woman that you'd ever seen?

673
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,240
对 就是这句 这... 对
Y-Yeah, that part. That... Yes. Mm-hmm.

674
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,490
是我冲动了
It was impulsive.

675
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,450
那是对陌生人说的话 可我们现在共事了
It was meant for a stranger, and we're working together now.

676
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,870
我只是不希望你认为我...
So, I just don't want you to think that I was...

677
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,950
对我有意思?
Interested?

678
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,670
我只是想把话说清楚
I just wanted to clear the air.

679
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,170
好的 说得很清楚
Oh. Well, the air was clear.

680
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,840
很好
Good.

681
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,100
我有个想法 对 那话只适用30秒
I had a thought. Yeah. It was perfect for 30 seconds.

682
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,260
有哪个电视网是全天候报道的?
What are the networks covering night and day?

683
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,390
你觉得我有时间看电视吗?
You think I have time to watch TV?

684
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,190
越南 他们直接从前线报道
Vietnam. They're broadcasting straight from the action.

685
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,020
人们已经不想只听新闻了
And people don't want to just hear the news anymore.

686
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,980
他们想直击新闻现场
They wanna see it in the making.

687
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,650
好吧
Okay.

688
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,280
不妨就让他们看
Why not let 'em?

689
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,280
(登月现场直播 阿波罗11号)

690
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,790
你想在登月舱里放个电视直播摄像机?
Oh, you want to put a live television camera on the LEM?

691
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,040
是的
Yes.

692
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,670
我的人在太空里努力活命
My guys are trying to survive up there.

693
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,630
没时间学如何拍电影
They don't have time to figure out how to film a movie.

694
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,130
我们替他们学 他们只需对准目标拍摄即可
We'll figure it out for 'em. All they have to do is point and shoot.

695
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,510
你不明白 这是后勤方面的噩梦
You don't get it. It's a logistical nightmare.

696
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,260
问题涉及电力 储存空间 重量
There's power issues, storage, weight.

697
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,180
甚至没有摄像机能在太空里工作
There's not even a camera that would work up there

698
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,720
因为夜晚温度是零下129摄氏度 白天超过121摄氏度
'cause it's negative 200 degrees at night and over 250 degrees during the daytime.

699
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,810
你能想像看直播的情景吗?
Can you imagine seeing it?

700
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,980
不能 我刚说了这不可能
No. I just said it's impossible.

701
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,730
对 这就是重点
Yes. That's the point. Mmm.

702
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,810
这将是有史以来最伟大的电视节目
It would be the greatest televised event ever.

703
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,530
你认为这是个综艺节目吗?
Do you think this is a game show?

704
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,820
苏联人没有播出
There is a very good reason

705
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,650
他们在太空行走是有充分理由的
why the Soviets aren't broadcasting their space walks.

706
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,700
因为苏联是守口如瓶的独裁政权国
Because they're a tight-lipped dictatorship.

707
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,990
对 我们不是 天啊
Yeah, that's not us. Wow.

708
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,040
我们取得成功 是举国成功
When we succeed, we do it as a nation.

709
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,410
我们遭遇失败 是举国悲痛 对
And when we fail, we grieve as a nation. Right.

710
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,210
这就是作为美国人的意义所在
That's what it means to be American.

711
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,750
别跟我说作为美国人意味着什么
Oh, stop telling me what it means to be an American.

712
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,960
我们当中只有一个人一辈子在报效祖国
There's only one of us here that has served their country their entire life.

713
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,800
抱歉 登月舱里不会放摄像机的
I'm sorry. We're not putting the camera on the LEM.

714
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,850
我是认真的 不放
I mean it. We're not.

715
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,060
我们会放的
We are.

716
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,940
(压力点)

717
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,490
没有更多燃料 他不可能成功
There's no way he can do it without more fuel.

718
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,200
让他再测一次 好
Have him run it again. Yeah.

719
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,290
好 我时间很紧 什么事?
Okay. [sighs] I'm on a tight schedule. What is it?

720
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:31,250
凯莉跟我说了摄像机的点子 我们很喜欢
Kelly briefed me on the camera idea, and we like it.

721
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,220
非常喜欢
We like it a lot.

722
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,550
她说错了 我们做不到
She misspoke. We can't do it.

723
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,510
根本没有这种科技
There is no such technology that even exists.

724
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,140
其实有 你知道吗?
Actually it does. You know?

725
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,890
这是国防部设计的
The Department of Defense designed this

726
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,310
为了夜间寻找在越南被击落的飞行员
to find downed fighter pilots in Vietnam at night.

727
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,940
听着 这是机密 但国防部会给你使用
Now, it's classified but the DOD is going to let you use it

728
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,780
只要没人知道它是什么即可
as long as nobody knows what it is.

729
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,950
绝对没有空间装这么重的设备
There's absolutely no space for equipment that heavy.

730
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,700
老天 我们连螺丝钉都称重
We are weighing screws for God's sake.

731
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,570
什么... 这也就7公斤吧
What... I mean, what is this, 15 pounds?

732
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,450
好吧 那就用轻一些的螺丝钉
Okay. So, just, like, lighter screws.

733
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,370
我们在试用另一个燃料单元
We're trying for another fuel cell.

734
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:08,170
好让我们的人登月后 依然有足够的燃料发射
So our men, when they get to the moon, they still have enough fuel to lift off.

735
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,340
她所有的馊主意当中 这个是最糟糕的
Out of all her bad ideas, this one is the worst.

736
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,840
其实总统很喜欢这个点子
Actually, the president loves it.

737
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,430
所以现在这就是个好主意
So, now it's a great idea.

738
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,140
我跟你用简单的话说吧 科尔
So, let me put it to you simply, Cole.

739
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,890
找个办法把这东西放进那东西
Find a way to put this on that.

740
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,810
这是命令 顶头老大下达的
This is an order. From the tippy top.

741
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,030
唐 斯图 请到这里来
Don, Stu. Can you come in here, please?

742
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,580
谢谢 别什么事都闹别扭
Thank you. Let's not make everything so hard.

743
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,170
请帮琼斯小姐把这个绝密摄像机拆出来
Please help Miss Jones strip this top secret camera down.

744
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,340
我不希望他们知道这是绝密
I don't want 'em to know it's top secret.

745
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,420
现在他们知道了
Well, now they do.

746
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,260
请把这个绝密摄像机拆出来
Please strip this top secret camera.

747
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,090
装在登月舱上 以备直播
Mount it onto the LEM for live broadcasting.

748
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,350
科尔 还有一件事
Cole. One last thing.

749
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:09,310
上周 一架中情局的间谍飞机拍到几张
Last week, a CIA spy plane took some surveillance photographs

750
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,110
苏联新型N1火箭的照片
of the new Russian N1 rocket.

751
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,820
国会看到了
And Congress saw it,

752
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,690
有些议员对最后一轮拨款
and some of the members are having cold feet

753
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,360
产生了疑虑
about the final round of funding.

754
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,280
我们还有好几个月才能赢下登月竞赛
We're months away from winning this thing.

755
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,030
我会让他们来这里参观
I'm gonna send them down here,

756
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,290
你要说服他们稍安勿躁
and you're gonna convince them to sit tight.

757
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,210
不 我... 来写几个和他们谈话的要点
No. I'm... I'm gonna write up some talking points.

758
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,760
别往心里去
Don't take it personally.

759
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,300
飞行员和重力对抗 这是他们的天性
Pilots fight gravity. It's part of their nature.

760
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,450
亨利?
Henry?

761
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,670
我... 很高兴你不是科尔
Well, I'm... I'm glad you're not Cole.

762
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,750
是
Oh? Yeah.

763
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,920
他不喜欢我吸烟
He don't like me smoking.

764
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,920
怎么 你怕他会给你下禁足令?
What, are you worried he's gonna ground you?

765
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,260
不 我... 去年做了紧急搭桥手术
Uh, no. I, uh... I had emergency bypass surgery last year.

766
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,810
对 那个混蛋非常顽固 非要我活下去
Yeah. That son of a bitch. He's hell-bent on keeping me alive.

767
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,520
抱歉 我不知道
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

768
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,440
是 这里没人知道
Yeah. Nobody here does.

769
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,730
除了科尔
Just Cole.

770
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,110
对 他到医院来 安慰了我太太三天
Yeah. He came to the hospital and held my wife's hand for three days.

771
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,820
是的 我们认识很久了
Yeah. It's a long way from the day we met.

772
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,870
当时那小子刚从朝鲜回来
Kid had just got back from Korea.

773
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,250
是空军最优秀的飞行员
The top pilot in the Air Force.

774
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,500
银星勋章 飞行十字勋章
Silver Star. Flying Cross.

775
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,300
他们当时选宇航员时 他在爱德华兹空军基地是头号人选
He was first in line at Edwards when they were looking for astronauts.

776
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,970
但他最后没能入选
But, uh, he ended up not making the cut.

777
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,480
为什么? 是他的脾气吧
So, what got him? It was his temper.

778
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,480
不... 是他的心脏
No, no. His heart.

779
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,850
医生发现他有心房颤动
Doc found an A-fib.

780
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,150
这个小毛病足以让他无法参加太空计划
A little thing but enough to keep him out of the program.

781
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,660
最优秀的飞行员科尔·戴维斯 却永远无法上太空
Cole Davis is the best pilot who will never get to space.

782
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:43,300
我在过去15年里天天看这个景色
You know, I've been looking at this view every day for the last 15 years.

783
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,180
但最近我有种第一次看到的感觉
But lately, it's like I'm seeing it for the first time.

784
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:54,640
阿波罗1号给这里留下了巨大的阴影
Apollo 1 cast a big shadow on this place.

785
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,690
重新看到一些光明真好
It's nice to have some light back.

786
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
好了
Okay.

787
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,200
嘿 我总看到科尔每天晚上开车去那边
Hey, I keep seeing Cole drive out there every night.

788
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,580
他在做什么?
What's he doing?

789
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,590
做园艺
Gardening.

790
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,190
(34号发射场)

791
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,280
(阿波罗1号乘组的精神永垂不朽)

792
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,290
准备好了吗? 好了
You ready? Yeah.

793
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,890
好 听着 我们... 带参议员参观一下
All right. Look, we just... We give the senator a tour.

794
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,350
我们好好哄他30分钟 把这个地方运营下去
We play nice for 30 minutes. We keep the lights on.

795
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,560
好 行吧
Okay. Fine.

796
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,600
怎么了? 它在那里
What? She's just there.

797
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,770
别... 跑 不...
Don't run. No, no.

798
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,890
千万别跑 别... 等等 闭嘴
Just don't run. Don't... Wait. [shushing] Shut up.

799
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,780
不 你看 你把它吓跑了
No. See, you scared it.

800
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,860
我刚吃过东西
I just ate.

801
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,160
亨利 快...
Henry, come on! Come on!

802
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,670
我讨厌那只猫
I hate that cat.

803
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,090
我懂你的意思
I see what y... you mean.

804
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,630
这... 猫真讨厌 你看到它看我的眼神了吗?
That's an asshole cat. Did you see the look it gave me?

805
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,340
它在嘲讽我
It's just taunting me now.

806
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,840
这是什么? 是猫食
What is that? That's cat food.

807
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,100
有人在喂它 是谁?
Somebody's feeding that thing. Who's doing that?

808
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,970
找出来 立刻查出是谁 立刻炒掉
Find them. [pants] Find them immediately, and fire them immediately.

809
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,560
戴维斯先生 长官 霍普参议员来了
Mr. Davis. Sir, uh, Senator Hopp is here.

810
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,270
好 怎么了? 你看起来很帅
All right. What? You look fine.

811
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,360
参议员
Senator.

812
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,730
你好 戴维斯先生 参议员 我很荣幸
Hello, Mr. Davis. Senator. What an honor.

813
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:49,570
我很荣幸 幸会 先生 幸会
It's an honor and a pleasure. Very nice to see you.

814
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
阿波罗11号太空舱已经运达
Well, the Apollo 11 capsule has arrived,

815
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,830
下周 我们会把它装在土星5号火箭上
and next week, we will be attaching it to the Saturn V rocket.

816
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:01,080
也就是发射升空 带我们离开地球大气层的那个火箭
And that gets us off the ground and out of earth's atmosphere.

817
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,830
这些都很了不起 但我得直说
Well, that's all very impressive, but I have to be up-front.

818
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,130
佐治亚州今年洪水泛滥
Georgia had some devastating floods this year.

819
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,470
我要投票把这笔钱用于赈灾
And I'm voting to put this money toward our relief fund.

820
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,430
这似乎有点自私 不是吗?
That seems a little selfish, don't you think?

821
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,970
你说什么? 就是一种说法
Excuse me? Uh, that's a figure of speech.

822
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,600
他是这个意思 我的大多数投票人认为
Here's what he means. My voters mostly think

823
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,230
我们在登月计划上花费过多
we are overspending on the moon.

824
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,850
有意思 因为当我... 哟呼
That's funny, because... Yoo-hoo!

825
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,940
不好意思 霍普参议员
Excuse me. Senator Hopp.

826
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,360
你可能不记得我了
Oh, you probably don't remember me,

827
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,530
但你在我大二时来我学校做过演讲
but you spoke at my sophomore year of college.

828
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,700
佐治亚理工学院 1955级
Georgia Tech. '55.

829
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,950
你是个大黄蜂校友?
You're a Buzz?

830
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,070
是的 先生 我当然记得
Yes, sir. Of course I remember.

831
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,280
那天 你的话激励了我
Your words inspired me that day.

832
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:43,210
你说“承诺意味着忠于一项事业”
You said, "Commitment means staying loyal to a cause."

833
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:46,880
两年后 我以优异的成绩毕业 现在我负责这个部门
Two years later, I graduated with honors. Now I run this department.

834
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,130
1962年 你曾说过 你无论如何
You know, in '62 you said that you would fight

835
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,170
都会为肯尼迪的梦想而奋斗
for Kennedy's dream no matter what.

836
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,220
我知道登月任务在当时比现在受欢迎
I know that the moon mission was more popular back then,

837
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,430
但如果那个激励我 在国家航空航天局工作的人
but it would be just a shame

838
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,940
没能照当年的那些话去做
if the man whose words inspired me to work at NASA

839
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,770
就太可惜了
didn't live by those very same words.

840
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:12,860
那就太可惜了 不是吗? 先生 你真是个了不起的人
It would be a shame, wouldn't it? Sir, you are just such a wonderful man.

841
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,030
非常感谢
Thank you so much. Mmm.

842
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:15,400
你真了不起
You are a wonderful man.

843
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,490
她可真是个佐治亚州甜心美女
Isn't she just a wonderful Georgia peach here?

844
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:18,570
天啊 是
Oh, my. Oh. Yes.

845
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,740
你嘴真甜 是的
You are so sweet. Yes, I am.

846
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,750
我带你来一次贵宾级的参观吧 这是他们的保密项目
Let me take you on the special VIP tour they didn't tell you about.

847
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,710
好啊 太好了
Oh, I'd love that. Wonderful.

848
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:28,710
你会陪我一起参观吗?
Do you go on this tour with me?

849
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,250
当然会
I absolutely will.

850
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,880
你真好
That's so sweet.

851
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,800
她都热泪盈眶了 真吓人
She teared up. I mean, it's scary.

852
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,630
挥手微笑
Wave and smile.

853
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,010
拜拜
Bye-bye!

854
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,390
太空计划不光臃肿又混乱
The space program is not only a bloated mess,

855
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:49,400
阿波罗号还是对上帝
but Apollo flies in the face of our creator

856
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,610
和我国国父的不敬 我想提醒大家 我们不...
and the true father of this country. I would remind you that we don't...

857
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:58,570
我们搞定了霍普 还需要两票 看起来不会是范宁了
We landed Hopp. We need two more votes. Looks like it's not gonna be Vanning.

858
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:02,200
绝对不是范宁 接下来是库克参议员
Definitely not Vanning. Next, we have Senator Cook.

859
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,040
库克有点吓人 我实话实说
Cook's a little scary. I'm not gonna lie.

860
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,910
他是冷战时期的保守派
He's a Cold War conservative.

861
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:10,710
他担心我们的预算 会从国防部的武器研发经费里出
He's worried that our budget takes away from weapons development at the DOD.

862
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,300
好 参议员 有了N1火箭
Now, Senator, with the N1 rocket,

863
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,720
苏联人还是有可能抢在我们前面登月
the Russians still could land on the moon before us.

864
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,760
我们接下来要向你展示的最新情报
What we're about to show you is our most recent intel

865
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,760
是他们登月后计划建造的东西
on what they plan to build if they do.

866
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,310
这些是照片? 不是 先生
And these are photos? No, sir.

867
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,400
是概念画 描绘可能的未来
Those are, uh, renderings of a possible future.

868
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,940
未来的照片?
Future photos?

869
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,150
那是个激光炮?
Is that a laser?

870
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,030
它正对着地球开火 先生
It's going towards earth, sir.

871
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,870
它叫什么? “要你命月球激光大杀器” 先生
What are they calling it? "Killer Lunar Laser Eliminator," sir.

872
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,000
“要你命月球激光大杀器”? 是 先生
"Killer Lunar Laser Eliminator"? Yes, sir.

873
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,710
见鬼 厉害了
Damn it. That's good.

874
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,170
最后还有赫奇斯参议员
And, finally, we have Senator Hedges.

875
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,420
他一直是阿波罗的粉丝
Now, he's always been a fan of Apollo,

876
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,130
但州政党给他施压 叫他不得拨款
but he's getting pressure from his state party not to fund.

877
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,340
他连呼吸都要对着媒体的镜头
He can't take in oxygen without a camera pointed at him,

878
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,260
那我们就去请点扛摄像机的朋友来
and we're about to have a few of those around here.

879
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,010
有什么问题吗?
Any questions?

880
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:06,100
没有 女士
No, ma'am.

881
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,390
那我们去搞定他吧
Well, let's get him then.

882
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:12,730
大家好
Hello, everyone!

883
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,480
先生们
Gentlemen.

884
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,610
我... 很高兴能故地重游 各位
It's... It's... It's great to be back, everyone.

885
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,830
你们知道我有多喜欢阿波罗计划
You know how much I love the Apollo program.

886
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,710
参议员 阿波罗10号只会绕月飞行
Senator. Apollo 10 will just be orbiting the moon.

887
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:34,290
但能给我们带来 11号在月球着陆的关键信息
But it's gonna get us information critical for the touchdown of 11.

888
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,590
比如着陆条件和地点 了不起
Like landing conditions and location. Amazing.

889
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,090
我们为你准备了专座 参议员 在你的支持者中间
And we've a special seat for you here, Senator, amongst your fans.

890
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,680
为我吗? 谢谢
For me? Oh. Thank you.

891
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,720
阿波罗发射控制中心 现在可以开始
Apollo launch control, and we are go on the countdown

892
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,890
阿波罗10号登月任务的倒计时了
for the Apollo 10 lunar mission at this time.

893
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,400
点火程序启动
We have ignition sequence start.

894
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,280
五 四 三 二...
Five, four, three, two...

895
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,240
所有引擎启动
All engines running.

896
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,620
发射 火箭升空
Liftoff. We have liftoff.

897
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,750
现在是整点后49分
Forty-nine minutes past the hour.

898
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,340
发射塔已分离...
Tower clear. Tower clear.

899
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,210
休斯敦 交给你了
Houston, she's all yours.

900
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,450
壮观的发射 我都等不及回来看阿波罗11号了
Glorious launch. Can't wait to be right back here for Apollo 11.

901
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,030
我们非常感谢你的支持 参议员
We cannot thank you enough for your support, Senator.

902
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,370
有件事会麻烦你们一下
It's gonna cost you more than a pair of binoculars.

903
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,920
我欠老家做新闻的人一个人情
I owe a favor to the news fellas back home.

904
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,630
我希望你能接受他们的出镜采访
I'd like you to give them an on-camera interview.

905
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:01,000
参议员 我是最不适合出镜的人了
Uh, Senator, I'm the very last person that you want in front of a camera.

906
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,090
我... 不接受采访的
Uh, I d... I don't do interviews.

907
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:06,390
但为你可以破例 赫奇斯参议员 我们很乐意
Except for you, Senator Hedges. We would be delighted.

908
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,640
这女士很机智
Smart lady.

909
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,600
晚安 晚安
Good night. Good night.

910
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,650
凯莉
Kelly?

911
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,730
没事的
It's okay.

912
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,610
一切尽在掌握
Got it all under control. Mm-hmm.

913
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,320
(好样的 阿波罗)

914
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,930
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey.

915
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,810
你也可以休息一晚的
You're entitled to a night off too, you know.

916
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,310
我若休息 那就是睡觉
If I am, it's to sleep.

917
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,440
你真的有家吗?
Oh, you actually have a house?

918
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,150
我还以为你在办公室睡呢
I thought you slept at the office.

919
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:04,240
对 通常是 但... 我有时和珍妮一起睡
Well, yeah. Usually. But, uh... Well, I mean, sometimes I sleep with Jenny.

920
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,030
好吧 是 她一定很棒
Oh, yeah. Right. Oh. I'm sure she's great.

921
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,740
珍妮吗? 对 确实
Jenny? Yeah. She... She is.

922
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,160
想认识一下吗?
You wanna meet her?

923
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,580
好啊 好 珍妮会喜欢你的 来
Yeah. Yeah. She'll love you. Come on.

924
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,680
珍妮 这是凯莉
Jenny. Jenny, uh, this is Kelly.

925
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,100
凯莉 这就是珍妮
Kelly, meet Jenny.

926
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,220
跟我战争中开的那架一样
She's just like the one I flew in the war.

927
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:40,190
我把它放在这里 方便在周末开出去兜兜风 省时间
Keep her here so I can get my flight hours on the weekends. Saves time.

928
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,320
很漂亮
She's quite a lady.

929
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,820
是的
Yeah. She is.

930
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,570
想飞一圈吗? 不了
Wanna go up? No.

931
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,660
你确定? 确定
You sure? Yeah.

932
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:55,410
好 来吧
Okay. Come on.

933
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,790
我带你看第二美的景色
Show you the second-best view.

934
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,180
看见那些深色的部分了吗? 看见了
You see those dark parts there? Yeah.

935
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,980
我们称之为“月海”
We call them the seas.

936
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,980
月海里的重力更强一些 所以...
The gravity is stronger in the seas, so...

937
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,610
我们研究过在每一片月海里着陆的情况
We've looked to land in, uh, pretty much every single one of them.

938
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:25,690
有澄海
You got the Sea of Serenity.

939
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:28,820
危海 我们很快便排除了这个
Sea of Crises. We crossed that one off the list pretty quick.

940
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,530
对 这个名字不利于宣传
Yeah. That's bad PR.

941
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:34,660
我们最后决定在宁静海着陆
And then we finally settled on, uh, the Sea of Tranquility.

942
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,080
那是最佳地点
That's the sweet spot.

943
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:42,750
这么一想 我... 对月球的了解
You know, come to think about it, I... I know a lot more about the moon

944
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,130
远远超过我对你的了解
than I know about you by a long shot.

945
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,260
我甚至不知道你是哪里人
I don't even know where you're from.

946
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,630
堪萨斯
Kansas.

947
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,310
来自堪萨斯的凯莉
Kelly from Kansas.

948
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,770
堪萨斯的凯莉 你是怎么进入广告这一行的?
How'd you get into advertising, Kelly from Kansas?

949
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:06,270
我爸爸离开时我四岁 妈妈失去了房子
Uh, well, I was four when my dad left, and my mom lost the house.

950
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:07,570
我们住在汽车里
We lived in a car.

951
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:12,900
一个教堂给了她一份卖曲奇罐的工作
And... a church gave her a job selling cookie tins.

952
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:19,080
所以她想了个点子 如果由我挨家挨户推销就能卖出更多
So, she had this idea that we'd sell more if it was me going door-to-door.

953
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,250
是啊 聪明的女士
Oh, yeah. Smart lady.

954
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:27,710
曲奇罐 然后卖吸尘器 我长大些就转而卖美容用品
Cookie tins, then it was vacuums, then beauty goods when I got older.

955
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,880
是的 我和我妈周游全国
Yeah. Traveling the country, me and my mom.

956
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,260
我们的生活就是这样重回正轨的
It's how we got back on our feet.

957
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,760
我很遗憾你不得不经历这些
Well, I'm sorry you went through that.

958
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:43,350
不必 我...
Well, don't be. I...

959
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,520
对 我很小就学会了如何生存
Yeah. I learned early on how to survive.

960
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:54,160
而且家家都有本难念的经
Plus, we all have our share of tough breaks.

961
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,250
亨利跟我说了 心房颤动和你被计划除名的事
Henry told me about the A-fib and you getting kicked out of the program.

962
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,120
我得去跟亨利聊聊
Hmm. I'm gonna have to have a little conversation with Henry.

963
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,300
不过我并不完全赞同你的说法
You know, I don't totally agree with you though.

964
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,260
怎么讲? 我就是不...
How's that? Well, I just don't...

965
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,220
我不认为我们的悲伤故事
I don't think that our sad stories are supposed to

966
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,940
就该教会我们如何在世上生存
teach us how to survive the world.

967
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,690
我认为它们应该激励我们去改变世界
I think they're supposed to make us wanna change it.

968
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,030
科尔
Hmm. Cole!

969
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:34,320
巴兹正在试图短路发动你的科迈罗
Buzz is trying to hot-wire your Camaro!

970
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,860
拜托 天啊
Come on, man.

971
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,830
那么...
Well...

972
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:41,330
你最好去阻止他
You better go stop him.

973
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,250
是的
Yeah.

974
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,770
(卫星汽车旅馆)

975
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,560
老天
Jesus!

976
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,190
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

977
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:18,110
阿凯 你的工作做得十分出色
You have done outstanding work, Kel.

978
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,530
公众的兴趣大大提高了
Public interest is way up.

979
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:25,330
你搞定了参议员们 确保发射能顺利进行
You landed the senators and secured the launch.

980
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,000
所以你就闯进我的旅店房间?
And that's why you broke into my motel room?

981
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,250
作为感谢吗?
As a thank you?

982
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,670
现在我们知道全世界都会盯着我们看
Now that we know the whole world will be watching,

983
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,840
我们不容有失
we can't afford to lose.

984
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:40,180
我们必须准备好呈献一个备用版本的
We need to be prepared to present an alternate version

985
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,760
登月任务
of the moon landing.

986
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,140
一个备用版本?
An alternate version?

987
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,520
阿尔忒弥斯版本
The... Artemis version.

988
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:53,020
她是阿波罗的孪生姐姐 也就是“备胎”
She was the twin sister of Apollo, uh, you know, the backup.

989
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:53,020
(绝密 阿尔忒弥斯计划)

990
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,530
我们必须准备好拍一个小短片
So we just need to be ready to shoot a little picture.

991
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:02,160
向人们展示宇航员在月球上行走
Something showing us, you know, up there walking around,

992
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,950
朝镜头挥手
waving at the camera.

993
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,160
你是说作假? 如果一切顺利 短片永远也用不上
You mean, to fake it? All goes well, we never use it.

994
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:09,420
但万一...
But if not...

995
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,510
你知道我为什么从没坐过牢吗?
You know why I never went to prison?

996
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:20,220
大概知道 但你说吧
Probably, but humor me.

997
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,800
因为我见好就收
'Cause I quit while I'm ahead.

998
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,930
这么大的事没法保密 这里有成千上万的员工
Can't keep a secret this big. Thousands of people work here.

999
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,850
也有成千上万人 在一个沙漠中的保密地点工作
Well, thousands of people work at a classified location in the desert

1000
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:35,980
他们在对一个外星飞行器舰队做实验
that experiments on a fleet of extraterrestrial pods

1001
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,440
是我们从海底捞上来的
that we found at the bottom of the ocean.

1002
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,110
你从来没听说过吧?
And you never heard about that, did ya?

1003
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:44,070
拜托 没这回事
Come on, that's not true.

1004
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:48,290
也许没有 也许有
Uh, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

1005
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,120
但有一件事是可以肯定的
But the one thing you can be sure of

1006
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:57,260
全世界都将看到美国人 在月球上插上美国国旗
is that the world will watch Americans plant an American flag on the moon.

1007
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:01,170
你是说尼克松总统支持这么干?
And you are telling me that President Nixon supports this?

1008
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,510
可能会 他还不知情
He probably would. He doesn't know about it

1009
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,810
同样 科尔·戴维斯也会永远蒙在鼓里
in the same way that Cole Davis will never know about it.

1010
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,600
这应该不是个问题
And that shouldn't be a problem

1011
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,270
毕竟虽然你们越走越近
considering what else you haven't shared with him

1012
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,990
但你还是有些事瞒着他
while you've grown closer.

1013
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,570
那么帅气的一个人会怎么想...
I mean, what would a clean-cut guy like that think about...

1014
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:23,870
你已经说得很清楚了
You made your point.

1015
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,200
谁也摆脱不了自己的过往
No one can outrun their past.

1016
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,160
但我可以永远抹除一个人的黑历史
But I can make it go away. Forever.

1017
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,040
不必再逃亡
No more running.

1018
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,630
我得需要助理帮忙
I'm gonna need my assistant.

1019
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:45,300
当然
Of course.

1020
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,220
我们会给你配一个安全特工团队
And we'll get you a team of secure agents.

1021
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:54,850
好了 你手里最厉害 但却没人听说过的导演是谁?
Now, who's the best director you've got that no one's ever heard of?

1022
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,400
你会喜欢他的
You're gonna love him.

1023
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,530
(政府财产 非请莫入)

1024
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:04,570
这是基地里最偏远的飞机库
This is the most remote hangar on the base.

1025
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:07,240
没有我的允许 任何人不得出入
No one can go in or out without my permission.

1026
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,740
等等 任何人? 连科尔都不行?
Wait, no one? Not even Cole?

1027
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,410
科尔尤其不行
Especially not Cole.

1028
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,090
难以置信 凯莉
Unbelievable, Kelly.

1029
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,460
你找人强行把我拖上飞机
You have me... forced onto a plane,

1030
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,210
把我带到这该死的佛罗里达
and brought to godforsaken Florida!

1031
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,760
能松手吗?
Do you mind?

1032
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,430
我是美国导演工会成员
I'm a member of the DGA.

1033
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:28,810
不能被这样粗暴对待
I will not be treated this way.

1034
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,770
我要给经纪人打电话 不行
I am calling my agent. You can't.

1035
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:32,850
我这就打给你看
Watch me.

1036
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,270
记住 我们谈过的 这是安保级别很高的政府项目
Remember we talked about this. This is a high-security government job.

1037
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,400
我给你的报价翻倍 好吧
I'm doubling your quote. Okay.

1038
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,570
还有奖金
With a bonus. Mmm.

1039
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:45,400
对 唯一的条件是不能让任何人知道 我们在干什么
Yes. The only caveat being that no one can ever know what we're doing.

1040
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:47,570
这我无法接受 他们会枪毙你
I cannot accept that. They will shoot you.

1041
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:49,370
预算是多少?
What is my budget?

1042
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:55,120
你花多少钱都行 只要把这里变成月球
Your budget is whatever it costs to turn this into the moon

1043
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,710
拍出两个半小时的片子来
for two-and-a-half hours.

1044
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:58,630
比《宾虚》短
It's shorter than Ben-Hur.

1045
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,690
我需要在那边摆一台装满汽水的冰箱
I will need a fridge full of Tab over there.

1046
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,610
和一大群不会提问的手下
And an army of minions who don't ask questions.

1047
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,700
凯莉 这些都不是真正的演员
Kelly, these aren't real actors.

1048
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:37,910
你只能用他们 这是最好的情况了
Well, this is the best you're gonna get.

1049
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,920
尼尔身高1.8米 谁是1.8米高?
Neil's 5'11 ". Anybody 5'11"?

1050
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,290
好 其他人散了吧
Okay. The rest of you are dismissed.

1051
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,340
选吧 等等 你
Take your pick. Mmm. Hold on. You.

1052
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,670
你来做我的私人助理
You're gonna be my personal assistant.

1053
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,050
我就叫你约瑟夫 这样有什么事你不会往心里去
I'll just call you Joseph so you can't take things personally.

1054
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:49,340
随便站一边去吧
Go stand somewhere.

1055
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,640
好 能把墨镜都摘了吗?
All right. Can we take these sunglasses off, please,

1056
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,600
好让我看到你们的眼睛 相信你们的话
so I can see your eyes and believe your truth?

1057
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,390
好 我要每个人来一段独白
Now, I want each of you to do a monologue.

1058
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:59,600
最好是经典桥段 但是老天啊
Preferably something classical, and by God,

1059
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,230
千万别给我来七遍《哈姆雷特》
don't make me watch seven Hamlets.

1060
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:03,320
你到时候看不见他们的脸 都戴着头盔呢
You're not gonna see their faces. They're wearing helmets.

1061
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,980
什...
Wh...

1062
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,570
好吧 那我如何
All right, how do I convey

1063
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:12,200
在不让观众看到人脸的情况下
the gripping fear of being on the moon for the first time

1064
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,370
展示第一次登月那揪心的恐惧?
if we can't show a human face?

1065
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,160
表演是一种运动 凯莉
Acting is a sport, Kelly.

1066
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,540
需要能量 身体... 我把设备放哪?
It is energy, body, bu... Where do I set up?

1067
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:20,710
爱德华?
Edvard? Ah.

1068
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:23,750
你怎么进来的? 从门口走进来的
How did you get in here? I just walked through the door.

1069
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:28,670
“此事说出去会害我们被杀” 这句话你哪儿不明白?
What part of "talking about this is gonna get us killed" do you not understand?

1070
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,300
而且他是纽约动作最慢的摄影指导 我来选摄影师
And he's the slowest DP in New York. I pick the cinematographer.

1071
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,680
写在合同里呢 什么? 你没有合同
It's in my contract. What? You don't have a contract.

1072
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,430
他最棒 所有的摄影指导动作都慢
He's the best, and all DPs are slow.

1073
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:39,310
凯莉 我们最需要的
What we need to have a serious conversation about, Kelly,

1074
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:41,600
就是美术指导
is production design, hmm?

1075
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,820
我们用什么材料来仿造月球表面?
What materials are we using to recreate the lunar surface?

1076
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,400
月球就是块大石头 对吧?
It's just a big rock, right?

1077
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,620
我没法这样工作 凯莉
I can't work like this, Kelly.

1078
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,000
你是了解我这一点的
You know this about me. Hmm?

1079
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,620
我需要细节
I need details.

1080
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,170
我们需要细节 具体细节
We need details. Specifics.

1081
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:08,340
是多尘 多石还是有风? 光源是怎样的?
Is it dusty, rocky, windy? What is the light source? Hmm?

1082
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:12,340
就是太阳咯 大灯 别自作聪明 爱德华
It's the sun. Big light. Do not smart-mouth me, Edvard.

1083
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,100
太阳和着陆区的位置关系是怎样的?
And what is the sun's position in relation to the landing area?

1084
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,180
我们要建一个仿制版吗? 我们有计划吗?
And are we building a replica? Do we have a plan?

1085
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,730
我们有宇航服吗? 演员穿上宇航服如何行动?
Do we have suits, and how do people move in those suits?

1086
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:24,270
还有 凯莉 太空里到底什么样子?
And what, Kelly, does space even look like?

1087
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:26,270
我... 得躺一下
You know, I gotta... I gotta lie down.

1088
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:28,820
我的拖车呢?
Where is my trailer?

1089
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,700
我们得想办法 把那个模拟室里的一切都照搬过来
We need to find a way to copy everything in that simulation room.

1090
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,330
好的 尽快
Okay. ASAP.

1091
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:38,410
等等 我有拖车吗?
Wait a second. Do I even have a trailer?

1092
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,540
你不说话我也知道
Your silence tells me what I already know.

1093
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,580
你还没想过怎样复刻月球
You haven't thought about how to recreate the moon,

1094
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,630
怎么会想拖车的事? 我觉得我们该找库布里克了
why would you think about a trailer? I think we should've gotten Kubrick.

1095
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:48,500
我们必须把新的飞船做对了
We've got to get this new ship right.

1096
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,260
阿姆斯特朗很生气
I mean, Armstrong, he was pissed off

1097
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,820
我们不能再惹他了 抱歉
and we can't have that again. Sorry.

1098
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:54,430
伙计...
Buddy, buddy.

1099
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,470
等等... 这些都是敏感材料
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is sensitive material.

1100
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,390
亨利... 不行 你不能待在这里
Henry. Henry. Uh-uh. You can't be here.

1101
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,180
这些照片是为了企鹅出版社的档案书拍的
These photos are for the archival book that Penguin is doing.

1102
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,980
什么书? 对 你没收到备忘录?
What book? Yeah, didn't you get the memo?

1103
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,440
没有 什么? 你要写前言
No. What? You're writing the foreword.

1104
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,270
我... 写前言? 对 是啊
I... I'm writing the foreword? Yeah, absolutely.

1105
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:08,820
我? 没错
Me? Yes, of course.

1106
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,190
我从没写过前言 编辑想听听你的话
I've never written a foreword. The editor wants to hear from you.

1107
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,490
我们都想 他要我写?
We all do. He wants me to write it?

1108
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,820
别这么谦虚好吗? 我们给你拍一张和...
Don't be so humble, all right? Let's get a photo of you with the...

1109
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,410
登月舱的合影 我可以写 但...
with the LEM. I mean, I can do it, but...

1110
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:17,620
说“我们要登月了”
Say, "we're going to the moon."

1111
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,620
我们要登月了 真不错
We're going to the moon. There you go!

1112
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,460
奥尔德林和阿姆斯特朗 每一个动作都要练习
Aldrin and Armstrong will practice every single movement that they make,

1113
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,330
在这里练好几个月
um, right here for months.

1114
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:26,710
真了不起 是
That is incredible. Yeah.

1115
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,960
这就是月球表面?
So, this is, like, the surface of the moon?

1116
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,090
是 这... 对
Well, yeah. It's... Yeah.

1117
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,420
是我们最接近的模拟
It's our best approximation.

1118
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:34,380
这看起来就像个肮脏的海滩 我不信 不可能
This just looks like a dirty beach. I don't believe it. No.

1119
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:36,340
是按... 我们得到的沉积物做的 约瑟夫
It is... It's based off sediment we got. Joseph.

1120
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,260
来自航天局
It's from NASA...

1121
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,140
等等 我不相信这就是国家航空航天局
Wait. I do not believe this is what NASA uses

1122
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,310
用来登月的装备 你别告诉我... 不行
to go to the moon. You cannot tell me... No.

1123
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:46,400
我要你们假装抱着母亲在沙漠里行走
Want you to walk as if you're carrying your mother across the desert.

1124
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,610
她很脆弱 但也很重
She's frail but also heavy.

1125
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:51,270
等等 嘿
Oh. Whoa. Hey.

1126
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,820
真抱歉 嘿 对不起 不能拍...
So sorry. Hey. Sorry. Oh, no, no. No.

1127
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,610
这是机密 你不能... 斯图 没事
This is classified. You're not allow... Stu, we're good.

1128
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,450
是机密 没事 这是为那本书拍的
Very classified. We're good here. This is for the book.

1129
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:57,570
你会听说的
No, you'll hear about it.

1130
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:58,490
我要写前言
I'm doing the foreword,

1131
01:06:58,490 --> 01:06:59,830
你很快会听说的 好吧
so you'll hear about it soon. Okay.

1132
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:02,660
我这个阿姆斯特朗是个总爱抱怨的烂人 我们得重新选角
My Armstrong is a whiny, little bitch. We have to recast.

1133
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:04,290
不 我们不重新选角
No... We're not recasting.

1134
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:06,540
好吧 那就平庸着拍吧
All right. Well, mediocre it is.

1135
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,000
爱德华 我的太阳呢?
Edvard! Where is my sun?

1136
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,840
很好
Nice!

1137
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,590
非常好 至少来个倒数啊
Very nice. A countdown at least.

1138
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,340
好 再开一次
Okay. Try it again.

1139
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,970
我再开一次 从三倒数
Gonna try it again. Do a three, two, one!

1140
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,050
拜托 满意吗?
Come on! Ah! Happy?

1141
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:19,340
约瑟夫 给我拿汽水来
J... Joseph, bring me my Tab.

1142
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,600
你得来找我 因为我眼都瞎了
You're gonna have to find me 'cause I can't see a thing.

1143
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,720
拜托 拿个汽水要多久?
Come on. How long does it take to give someone a Tab?

1144
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:25,310
我的手就在这里
My hand's right here.

1145
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,310
一定会很棒的 你们都该聚过来
Uh, this will be great. You guys should all come around

1146
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,480
我们来给那本书拍一张 很好吧?
and we'll do a shot for the book. Great?

1147
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,020
嘿 各位 这么说如何? “我们要登月了”
Hey, how about this? Everybody, "We're going to the moon!"

1148
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:35,030
我们要登月了
We're going to the moon!

1149
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,030
我好像眨眼了 再拍一张?
My eyes might have been closed. You wanna do one more?

1150
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,330
最近没看到你
I haven't seen you around lately.

1151
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,370
彼此彼此
Well, I can say the same thing about you.

1152
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,040
你怎么一次就系好了?
How do you do it on the first try?

1153
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,210
这又不是多复杂的事 好 准备好了吗?
It's not rocket science. Okay. You good?

1154
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:54,760
那些问题 我... 是的
About the questions, I... Yes.

1155
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:59,050
我都看过了 没有关于阿波罗1号的 他们答应过我 好吗?
I went over them. Nothing about Apollo 1. They promised me. Okay?

1156
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,260
你会表现得很好的 明白吗?
You're gonna be great. Okay?

1157
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,510
去吧
Mm-hmm. Go on.

1158
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:04,600
好 上
Okay. Go.

1159
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:10,100
戴维斯先生 你是我们口中的“采访困难户”
Mr. Davis. You are what we call "a tough get."

1160
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,190
哪有 谢谢
Ha! No. Thank you.

1161
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:14,480
我们将看到尼尔阿姆斯特朗 和巴兹奥尔德林走上月球表面
Is there any legal importance to what we'll be watching

1162
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,110
这有什么法律方面的重要意义吗?
when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the lunar surface?

1163
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:22,160
他们着陆的区域会被视为归美国所有吗?
Will the area they land on be considered property of the United States?

1164
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,830
我们要送一块匾上去 写着“我们为全人类的和平而来”
We're sending a plaque that says, "We came in peace for all mankind."

1165
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:27,410
那正是我们的意思
And that is precisely what we mean.

1166
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:29,460
国家航空航天局还会留下其他什么东西?
What else will NASA leave behind?

1167
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,290
足迹 一面美国国旗和12袋粪便
Footprints, an American flag and 12 bags of feces

1168
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:35,250
他们跟我说了很多次不要提 但是...
that I was told many times that I should not bring up, but...

1169
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,210
我们真该早点让他接受采访
Should've put him in front of a camera sooner.

1170
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,800
你戴着一枚阿波罗胸针
You wear an Apollo pin.

1171
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,430
是的
I do. Um,

1172
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:43,810
是阿波罗1号乘组的太太们
the wives of Apollo 1's men,

1173
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:47,100
在丈夫们牺牲后送我的
after we lost them, they gave me this.

1174
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,100
在那悲剧的一天 你是发射主管
You were launch director on that tragic day.

1175
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,690
阿波罗1号出了什么故障?
What went wrong with Apollo 1?

1176
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:59,900
用你自己的话说 发生了什么?
In your own words, what happened?

1177
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,530
帮我回顾一下
Take me back.

1178
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:09,830
好 我来给你列举一些事实
Okay. Here's some facts for you.

1179
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:11,000
《纽约时报》报道
The New York Times reported

1180
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,710
那艘飞船曾有两万份安全事件报告
there were 20,000 safety reports filed about that ship.

1181
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:17,420
实在太多 以至于加斯·格里森 用一个柠檬表示自己的不满
So many, that Gus Grissom hung a lemon outside it.

1182
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:22,970
好了 乘组 待确认 位置
All right, crew. To be confirmed. Location.

1183
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:23,970
着火了
Flame!

1184
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:26,050
驾驶舱里失火了
We've got a fire in the cockpit.

1185
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:26,970
快出去
Let's get out!

1186
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:29,980
戴维斯先生 你读过那些报告吗?
Mr. Davis? Did you read those reports?

1187
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:32,100
发射台主管 快进去救他们
Pad leader, get in there and help 'em.

1188
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:34,560
发射台主管 盯着C3
Pad leader, stay on C3.

1189
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,070
戴维斯先生 你读过那些报告吗?
Mr. Davis? Did you read those reports?

1190
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:49,450
你读过那些报告吗? 我当然读过那些报告
Did you read those reports? Of course I read the reports.

1191
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,460
每一份都读过
I read every single one of them.

1192
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,250
独立供电测试期间 氧气压力过高的同时遇到了线路故障
Overpressured oxygen and a bad wire on a "plugs-out" test.

1193
01:09:56,170 --> 01:10:00,210
我本该查出一切问题的 我看漏了 辜负了他们
I was supposed to catch everything, and I missed it. And I failed them.

1194
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:03,050
我余生中的每一天都会为此感到愧疚
And I will live with that every single day for the rest of my life.

1195
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:05,680
人渣 这是你想引述的原话吗?
Is that the quote that you were looking for, you piece of shit?

1196
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,220
让我跟你的老板通话 立刻 马上
Get me on the phone with your boss. Now. Now!

1197
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:12,390
等等 你干什么? 采访还有20分钟
Oh, uh, wait. W-What are you doing? We have another 20 minutes.

1198
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,480
去死吧
Go to hell.

1199
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,440
别生我的气 害死三个宇航员的人不是我
Don't be angry with me. I'm not the reason three astronauts are dead.

1200
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,990
你再提一句那些宇航员试试 嘿... 别冲动
Say one more thing about the astronauts. Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1201
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,910
放开我 你再说一句试试
Get off me. Let me hear you say one more thing...

1202
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,700
你再提他们一句试试
Let me hear you say one more thing about them!

1203
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,870
你不认识他们 你不准再提他们
You don't know those men! You don't talk about those men!

1204
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,660
放开我 放开
Get off me! Get off!

1205
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,750
放开
Get off!

1206
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,410
听懂了吗?
Do you understand me?

1207
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,470
我跟制作人们谈过了 他们同意不播出这段采访
So, I spoke to the producers, and they've agreed to seal the film

1208
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:47,180
条件是阿姆斯特朗着陆后 给他们独家采访
if we give them the exclusive with Armstrong after he lands.

1209
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,770
不过我们失去了赫奇斯的支持 他要投反对票了
We lost Hedges though. He's voting no.

1210
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,940
你说过他们不会问的 是的 他们撒谎了
You said they wouldn't ask about it. Yeah. Well... they lied.

1211
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,570
人们有时是会撒谎的 科尔
You know, people do that sometimes, Cole.

1212
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:03,570
你也许可以说点假话 那也算为自己
You could have done yourself and this program a favor

1213
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:05,610
和这登月计划帮了个忙 对吗?
and maybe tried it yourself. Right?

1214
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:07,450
责怪国家航空航天局
Blame NASA.

1215
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:08,620
责怪这个体系
Blame the system.

1216
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:12,120
事关价值五亿美元的资金啊
I mean, there was half a billion dollars worth of funding on the line.

1217
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,450
撒谎对你来说一定轻而易举吧 毕竟你总在撒谎
Lying must be so easy for you when you do it all the time.

1218
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,660
撒谎总是一个可选项
It's just always an option.

1219
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:18,210
你该试试说真话 你装什么清高呢?
What you should try is the truth. What is this sanctimonious bullshit?

1220
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,880
我永远不会就那些人或那一天的事撒谎
I'm never going to lie about those men or that day.

1221
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,010
你明白吗?
Do you understand that?

1222
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,630
随便你怎么看我
You think what you want about me,

1223
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,760
但因为不冷静 而让全人类登月梦破碎的人不是我
but I didn't cost the world a dream because I lost my goddamn cool.

1224
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:02,500
这是34号发射场 发生阿波罗1号悲剧的地方
This is Launch Complex 34, where the Apollo 1 tragedy occurred.

1225
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,210
这是牺牲英雄的纪念碑
This is a tribute to our fallen heroes,

1226
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:08,800
这些勇敢的人为我们的成功铺平了道路
the brave men who paved the road to our success.

1227
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,600
请大家为他们默哀片刻
Please, let's take a moment of silence for them.

1228
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,190
爱德华 真令人称奇
Edvard, that looks incredible.

1229
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,030
我完全看不到线缆 你怎么做到的?
I can't see the wires at all. How did you do that?

1230
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:29,030
我只是用了一块遮光板 很简单
I just put a flag. It's very simple.

1231
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,950
老办法了
Old school. Huh.

1232
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:32,450
不行 从头再来
No. Again. From the top.

1233
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:35,120
这次多加一些跳跃
And maybe let's get some more bounce this time.

1234
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,450
你们可是在月球上啊
You are on the moon.

1235
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,870
好
Good.

1236
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:46,880
天啊 我看不下去了 今天不行
Oh, my God. I-I can't. I can't with this day.

1237
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,800
天啊 好 坚持住 约瑟夫 失火了
Oh, dear. Uh... Okay, hold on. Joseph, there's a fire.

1238
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,970
我来
I got it.

1239
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,100
别忘记四步口诀
Don't forget to PASS.

1240
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,730
好 能放他们下来吗? 算了 挂着吧
Okay. Can you bring them down? Actually, leave them up.

1241
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:05,980
让他们反思一下自己都干了什么
Let them think about what they did.

1242
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,950
我放弃了 我去吃午饭
I give up. I'm taking lunch.

1243
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,330
你们明白自己干了什么吗? 你们让她提早去吃午饭了
You see what you did? You made her take lunch early.

1244
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:18,620
这都怪你们
That's on you.

1245
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:32,470
我跟你赌5美元 你不擅长道歉
I'll bet you $5 you're bad at apologies.

1246
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:33,760
我到处找你
I've been looking all over for you.

1247
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,350
你欠我5块 我有个想法
You owe me five bucks. I got an idea.

1248
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:36,430
什么?
What?

1249
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:38,270
来 去路易斯安那州的路上告诉你
Come on. I'll tell you on the way to Louisiana.

1250
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:41,140
不 你想尝试获得范宁的投票?
No. You wanna take a shot at Vanning?

1251
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:44,940
我给咱们弄到了晚餐邀请 就是今晚 走吧
I got us a dinner invite, for tonight. Come on.

1252
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,980
今晚? 我们不可能赶得上 有800公里呢
Tonight? We're never gonna make it. It's 500 miles away.

1253
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,070
我们能赶上 来 你得相信我
We're gonna make it. Come on. You gotta trust me.

1254
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:50,990
等等 不
Oh, wait. No.

1255
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:52,320
不行... 什么叫“不行”?
No, no, no. What do you mean, "no"?

1256
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,700
我们不能... 有其他... 我们可以... 你想不想要范宁支持?
We don't... There's other... We could... Do you want Vanning or not?

1257
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,660
我不... 来 我们走
Ugh. No. I don't... Come on. Let's go.

1258
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,830
我觉得我们可以乘民航 如果我们出发...
I think we could just take a commercial flight. If we left...

1259
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:00,750
不行 现在没有民航航班
Nope. No commercial flights are flying right now.

1260
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:02,410
来 跳上来
Come on. Just hop on in.

1261
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:05,130
就是这样 你只管上来就行 你可以跳上来的 你行的
This is it. This is all you gotta do. You can hop up, you can get in.

1262
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,920
脚踩那里 好吧 拿着我的鞋
Put your foot there. Okay, well, take these.

1263
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,380
听着 我们得走了 好
Look, we gotta go. All right.

1264
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,880
等等...
Hold on. Hold on.

1265
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,260
完美
Perfect.

1266
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,680
等等 没问题
Hold on. We're good.

1267
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,270
风景不错吧?
You enjoying the view?

1268
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:28,690
天啊 太美了
Wow! It's stunning!

1269
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:31,240
我打赌你闭着眼呢
I bet your eyes are closed.

1270
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,240
没有
No.

1271
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,960
我猜你还会些其他南方口音
So, I'm betting you have some other Southern accents

1272
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,920
毕竟你“多才多艺” 会路易斯安那的吗?
in that bag of tricks of yours. Can you do Louisiana?

1273
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,460
会 新奥尔良还是巴吞鲁日?
Yeah. New Orleans or Baton Rouge?

1274
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,050
用他老婆家乡的 好
Wherever his wife's from. Okay.

1275
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,010
科尔·戴维斯
Cole Davis.

1276
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:57,890
你一定是凯莉·琼斯小姐
And you must be Miss Kelly Jones.

1277
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:59,300
两位请进
Please come in, y'all. Oh.

1278
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:00,890
非常感谢你们邀请我们吃晚餐
Thank you so much for having us for dinner.

1279
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:04,480
好... 我听说你是纽约城里人
Oh, now... now, I was told you were a New York City type.

1280
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,940
天啊 不是 我只是在那里工作 我是路易斯安那人
Oh, God, no. I just work there. I'm from Louisiana.

1281
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,310
土生土长的 也会落叶归根
Born and raised and, one day, buried.

1282
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:11,070
我老家在弗吉尼亚 不会吧? 我们是亲人啊
I'm from Virginia. No? We're family.

1283
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:14,650
特克·斯里特尔总说 弗吉尼亚是得克萨斯的母亲
You know, Tex Ritter always said Virginia was the mother of Texas.

1284
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:17,910
我们一直不知道父亲是谁 总怀疑是路易斯安那
Well, we never knew who the father was. We always suspected it was Louisiana.

1285
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:19,910
我妈可喜欢这个笑话了
Oh! Huh? My mother loves that one.

1286
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:22,080
是她想出来的 太有意思了
She was the one that came up with it. Oh, just so colorful.

1287
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,210
你真有趣 你家可真漂亮
You're fun. This is a beautiful home.

1288
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:31,130
参议员 竞选活动怎么样?
So, h-how is the campaign going, Senator?

1289
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:35,340
说实话 政治更像是我的一项爱好
Truth be told, politics is more of a hobby to me.

1290
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:40,310
服事基督才是我的全职工作
Serving Christ, that's my full-time job.

1291
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:44,980
现在美国正有一场针对宗教的战争
You know, there's a war on religion in this country.

1292
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,650
有人说要怪科学
And some say science is to blame.

1293
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,560
是科学让我们今天齐聚一堂
Well, science is what brought us to this table.

1294
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:53,190
你从阿波罗1号的事上学到了
You learned a little lesson on the provocation of pride

1295
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:55,860
关于骄傲的一课 科尔 不是吗?
on Apollo 1, now, didn't you, Cole?

1296
01:15:56,950 --> 01:16:01,120
其实科学让我离上帝更近了 先生
Science has actually brought me closer to God, sir.

1297
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:05,540
上帝用了六天创造了我们所知的一切
Took the Lord six days to put forth everything that we know as creation.

1298
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,910
第六天 他把这些交给我们管理
And on that sixth day he gave us dominion over it.

1299
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,920
我个人认为这是一种责任
And, personally, I take that as a responsibility.

1300
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,420
你听起来很虔诚
You sound like a man who knows his way to church.

1301
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,840
我觉得最能体现虔诚的方法
Well, I can't think of a greater act of faith

1302
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,350
莫过于追逐星辰
than pursuing the stars.

1303
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,980
“诸天述说上帝的荣耀 穹苍传扬他的作为”
"The heavens declare the glory of God. And the firmament shows us his handiwork."

1304
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,140
这是乔琳娜最喜欢的诗篇句子之一
That's one of Jolene's favorite Psalms.

1305
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:31,860
是这样 等我们的人从太空归来
You see, our men, when they come back from space,

1306
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,610
他们对上帝的信仰会更多 不会减少
they believe more in God, not less.

1307
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,490
但我们登月时
But when we land on the moon,

1308
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:43,160
多亏了这位琼斯小姐 全球都能看到
and thanks to Miss Jones here, the world watches us do it.

1309
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:47,620
我希望世界各地的人都能感受到 那种圣神的存在
And it's my hope that people everywhere feel the presence of that divine.

1310
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:52,500
好吧
Well...

1311
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:58,970
你的话确实得让我好好想想 小伙子
you've, uh, certainly given me a lot to think about, son.

1312
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,850
你这推销还真有说服力啊
You really sold the hell out of that.

1313
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:11,350
我没在推销
I wasn't selling.

1314
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:16,990
郑重声明 做真实的自己也能赢得人心
For the record, you can win people over just by being who you are.

1315
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,870
我们现在不赶时间了 所以不必飞回去
You know, we're not in a rush, so we don't really have to fly home.

1316
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:26,700
那可不算飞
Ooh. That wasn't flying.

1317
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:39,800
拜托 睁开眼睛
Come on. Open your eyes.

1318
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,770
相信我吗?
You trust me?

1319
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,900
坐稳了
Hold tight.

1320
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,370
现在才是最好玩的 滑下来就行
Now, this is the fun part. Just slide off.

1321
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:13,540
完美
Perfect.

1322
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:05,430
我过去对国家航空航天局的计划 有过诸多意见不一致的地方
I've had my disagreements with the NASA program in the past.

1323
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:09,680
但经过深思熟虑和反覆祈祷后
But after a great deal of thought, and prayer,

1324
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:12,770
我决定投赞成票
I've decided to vote yes.

1325
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,650
好样的
Come on.

1326
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:21,940
我有样东西 你一定得看看
I have something that you need to see.

1327
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:23,570
什么... 跟我来
What... Follow me.

1328
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:25,900
我之前不知道结果会如何
Whoo! I didn't know which way it was gonna go,

1329
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:28,120
因为你根本看不透政客
'cause you can't tell with these guys.

1330
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,080
我之前向来不喜欢这家伙
I never liked that guy before, but...

1331
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,700
但我现在喜欢他了
I like him now.

1332
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:34,960
太好了
All right!

1333
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,120
这里好黑啊 你... 快到了
It's so dark in here. You... Almost there.

1334
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:39,840
我有点害怕 好了 就在这里
I'm a little scared. Yeah, it's right around here.

1335
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,920
(对你的感谢有如登月往返)

1336
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,510
我们想对你表达谢意
We wanted to show you our appreciation.

1337
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,880
天啊 这也太隆重了 谢谢
Oh, my gosh. This is too much. Thank you.

1338
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,930
不敢相信 都是沃尔特的功劳
I can't believe it. It was all Walter.

1339
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:51,970
沃尔特? 我知道这都是你操办的 对吧?
Oh, Walter? I know that you did all of this, didn't you?

1340
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:53,890
出了点力而已 是 我知道是你
A little. That's all. Yeah, I know you did.

1341
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,480
大家都帮忙了 还不错吧?
They all helped. Not too bad, huh?

1342
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,200
趁我还没忘 给
Before I forget. Here.

1343
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,500
这上面列出了 登月后你迈出第一步时可以说的话
It's a list of things for you to say when you take your first step.

1344
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,460
我... 知道所有人都在问你 就是想给你些点子
I... I know everybody's asking you. I thought I'd give you some options.

1345
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,590
我本来想说
Well, I was just gonna say,

1346
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,710
“看这些酷酷的石头”之类的话
"Look at all those cool rocks," or something.

1347
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,340
我能搞定的 凯莉 好
I got this one, Kelly. Okay.

1348
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:28,550
不过谢谢你
And thank you, though.

1349
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:32,060
真心的 谢谢... 你所做的一切
And I mean it. For, uh... For everything.

1350
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:38,600
我觉得没有人比科尔·戴维斯 更在乎这个计划
You know, I don't think anyone cares about this program more than Cole Davis.

1351
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:43,480
很高兴看见他有其他在乎的东西了
It's nice to see he's found something else to care about.

1352
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:06,420
我知道我不是宇航员 但我能请你跳一支舞吗?
I know I'm no, uh, astronaut, but can I steal you for a dance?

1353
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:09,260
可以 可以? 来
Yes. Yes. Yeah? Come on.

1354
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,150
你在数着日子 等待回到曼哈顿的那一天吗?
So, you just counting down the days until you, uh, can get back to Manhattan?

1355
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:23,980
并没有
Not really.

1356
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,150
很好
Good.

1357
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,300
往上... 很好 好了 把灯搬过来
Up, up, up. Perfect. Right, now, move the light in.

1358
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,340
好 继续 别害羞
All right, keep going. Don't be shy.

1359
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,430
继续...
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

1360
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:57,060
充分利用 很好
Milk it. Good. Mm-hmm.

1361
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,930
女士们 觉得如何?
Ladies, what do we think?

1362
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,400
兰斯 太惊人了 很棒
Lance, it's incredible. It's great.

1363
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,270
我觉得还需要再来点尘土和更好的演员
I think it needs a little more dust and better actors,

1364
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,150
但我的要求被拒了
but I lost that battle.

1365
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:10,990
我也就不纠结了
I will let it go.

1366
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:14,450
停 好
And, stop. Okay.

1367
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:16,160
我们有太阳了
We've got our sun.

1368
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,040
我总是配合你编造的那些谎言
I always went along with every web you spun

1369
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:23,080
要么是因为它们很有趣 要么我们是在骗坏人
because it was fun or, like, we were pulling one over on the bad guys,

1370
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,130
但这次的感觉...
but this feels...

1371
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:26,290
我知道
I know.

1372
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,090
就快完工了
We're almost done.

1373
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:35,760
这是我送你的
This is from me.

1374
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,510
发射日礼物
It is for launch day.

1375
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:40,720
答应我 到时候再拆
Promise you will wait until then.

1376
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:42,140
我答应 好
I promise. Okay.

1377
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:46,520
记住 你们不是怪兽
Remember, you're not monsters.

1378
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:49,820
会跳那么高吗?
Are they gonna be that high?

1379
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,690
我只需要让他们的跳跃距离
Uh, I just need to give them any length

1380
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,700
看起来像在月球上即可 但谢谢你的意见
that looks like they're on the moon. But thank you for the note.

1381
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,200
巴兹 动作幅度小一点
Buzz, take it down some.

1382
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:59,990
阿姆斯特朗 不要看我寻求肯定
And, Armstrong, stop looking at me for approval.

1383
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:03,660
专心演好身处月球 把我当空气 他排练得很开心...
Just be on the moon. I'm not here. He's having fun. He's having fun.

1384
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:06,670
他总是和我四目相交 别暗送秋波了 专心演身处月球
He keeps locking eyes with me. Stop flirting and be on the moon.

1385
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,850
昨天的科幻小说成为了今天的现实
Yesterday's science fiction is today's fact.

1386
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:20,260
方法虽然不同
The methods are different,

1387
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:22,810
但重要的是明天一早
but the important thing is that tomorrow morning,

1388
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,230
人类将飞向月球
man will lift off toward the moon.

1389
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,240
晚上好 我是沃尔特·克朗凯特
Good evening. I'm Walter Cronkite.

1390
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:44,250
在人类首次登月之旅的前夕
And on this eve of man's first flight toward a landing on the moon,

1391
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,790
所有的准备工作都很顺利
all preparations go smoothly.

1392
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:48,210
天气预报状况良好
The weather prediction,

1393
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:51,050
还有宇航员们的帮助 尼尔 阿姆...
along with the health of astronauts, Neil Arm...

1394
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,370
怎么了?
Yes?

1395
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:34,380
你很会伤人心啊
Well, you know how to hurt a fella.

1396
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:36,550
礼貌性的电话都不打一个?
No courtesy call?

1397
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:38,260
我没有你的电话号码
Well, I don't have your number.

1398
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:39,390
你逃跑了
You ran.

1399
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:42,560
这是你最擅长的事
That's what you do best.

1400
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:46,100
你这个备用版本的登月是个错误 我原本就不该参与
Your alternate version is wrong. I never should've been a part of it.

1401
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,230
我不干了
I quit.

1402
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:48,980
坐
Sit.

1403
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,570
今天你要扮演谁呢?
So, who are we gonna be today?

1404
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:01,910
我来看看
Let's see.

1405
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,990
(目的地 希思罗机场)

1406
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,370
海伦·帕克
Ooh, Helen Parker.

1407
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:09,210
我打赌 你的英国口音一定很纯正
I bet you do a killer British accent.

1408
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:13,460
你想一走了之 去当海伦? 请便
You wanna take off and be Helen? Go ahead.

1409
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:18,510
海伦不必提心吊胆地生活
Helen doesn't have to look over her shoulder.

1410
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:20,470
没有人会来找你的
No one is coming for you.

1411
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,300
除非呢?
Unless?

1412
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:28,140
除非你向任何人透露 阿尔忒弥斯计划真实存在
Unless you ever tell anyone that Project Artemis was real,

1413
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:31,060
登月是虚假拍摄的
and the moon landing was fake.

1414
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:34,900
说到这个 计划有变
Oh, on that score, change of plans.

1415
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,610
我们会播出备用版本的登月
we're going to air the alternate version.

1416
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:40,740
无论如何都播
No matter what.

1417
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,910
你们从来没打算播出真实的登月
Oh, you were never gonna broadcast the real thing.

1418
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,910
这不光是登月竞赛
This isn't just a race for the moon.

1419
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:50,120
而是哪一种意识形态说了算的竞赛
It is a race for which ideology gets to run things.

1420
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:55,380
我让一个手下改装了登月舱摄像机 让它只传回声音
I got one of my men to rig the LEM camera so that it just beams back audio.

1421
01:25:55,380 --> 01:26:00,670
我们会把他们的声音同步到你的假舞台上
We're gonna sync with their sound and, uh, use your fake stage broadcast,

1422
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,590
从头到尾播出
start to finish.

1423
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:07,720
让我第一个代表美国感谢你
Let me be the first to thank you on behalf of America.

1424
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:15,150
好了 别难过 人人都能得到想要的结果
Come on, don't feel bad. Everybody gets what they want.

1425
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:19,780
你可以展开新生活 不必再逃避过往
You get a new life with no past to run from.

1426
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:25,030
全世界也不必在共产主义的月光下入眠
And the world doesn't have to sleep under a communist moon.

1427
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,910
好了 巴拿马在召唤
Okay. Panama beckons.

1428
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:35,210
你最好快点 要赶不上飞机了 海伦
You better hurry. You're going to... miss your flight, Helen.

1429
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:42,260
这是为阿波罗号太空飞船上宇航员
This is a typical meal served to astronauts

1430
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,130
提供的典型餐点
aboard Apollo space flights.

1431
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,470
燕麦片 吐司
Oatmeal, toast,

1432
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:51,270
和一个特制的零重力饮品袋 装的是能量早餐饮品“果珍”
and a special zero-gravity pouch. Tang, the energy breakfast drink.

1433
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:53,730
其维生素C含量超过橙汁
And more vitamin C than orange juice.

1434
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:58,270
能量果珍 太空人和地球家庭的选择
Energy Tang, for spacemen and Earth families.

1444
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:49,800
你怎么来了?
What are you doing here?

1445
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:54,680
我得给你看一样东西
I need to show you something.

1446
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:59,770
这本来是个应急计划
It was supposed to be a contingency plan.

1447
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:02,270
他是这样说服我的 就是个保险措施
That's how he sold it. It was an insurance policy.

1448
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,480
以防我们失败
In case we failed.

1449
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:07,150
知道了也好
It's good to know...

1450
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,410
你从来没相信过我们
that you never believed in us.

1451
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:10,990
我知道你很难过
I know you're upset.

1452
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:12,740
我理解 你理解什么?
I understand... Oh, what do you understand?

1453
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:14,740
请告诉我你理解什么
Please tell me what you understand.

1454
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,620
因为你对真相一点都不理解
'Cause you don't understand shit about truth.

1455
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,660
如果你伪造这次任务...
If you fake this mission... If you fake this mission,

1456
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,170
那我们之前做出的每一次牺牲全都白费了
every single thing that we have sacrificed will have been for nothing.

1457
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,510
我知道我搞砸了 我知道
I know I messed up. I know that.

1458
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:28,840
但你心里清楚 如果没有我 你们根本走不到今天
But you know you couldn't have made it to this day without me.

1459
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,340
我昨晚大可一走了之 但我没有
I could've walked away last night, but I didn't.

1460
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:35,060
我回来是为了弥补这个错误
I came back to fix this.

1461
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:38,310
弥补什么?
Fix what?

1462
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:41,940
莫切断了登月舱的画面 如果我们不一起修好它
Moe cut the LEM camera, and if we don't fix this together

1463
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:44,060
那全世界看到的将会是这个版本
then this is gonna be the version that the world sees.

1464
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:50,410
这不是应急计划
It's not a contingency.

1465
01:29:53,950 --> 01:29:56,080
天啊 你总能让我别无选择
God, you're so good at leaving me no options.

1466
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:03,880
好吧 我们去修好它
Fine, let's fix it.

1467
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,510
但等这事结束 我再也不想看到你
But when this is over, I never wanna see your face again.

1468
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:24,310
为理查德·尼克松做事就是这种下场
This is what happens when you work for Richard Nixon.

1469
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:28,780
我看了你的素描本 露比
I got your book, Ruby.

1470
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:30,570
你提早拆开了
You opened it early.

1471
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,740
拆得正是时候
It came at just the right time.

1472
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,500
适合发射的大气层
Proper atmosphere for launch

1473
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:47,090
是氧气和氮气的混合物
which is a combination of oxygen and nitrogen.

60%的氧气和40%氮气的大气层
Sixty percent oxygen and 40% nitrogen atmosphere.

1475
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,800
当然 宇航员们呼吸的是
Of course, the astronauts themselves are breathing pure oxygen

through their space suits.

Guys!

1489
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:33,420

坏掉了 好吧 你能修好吗?
It's destroyed. Okay, can you fix that?

1492
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:38,720
我也许能从电视上拆一个改装 但...
I could maybe repurpose a part from a TV, but...

1493
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,640
好啊 这里有很多电视
Well, that's fine. There's plenty of TVs around here.

1494
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,220
航天局的电视都太老旧了
NASA's TVs... They are all too old.

1495
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:44,940
我要一台全新的晶体管彩色电视
I mean a brand-new solid-state color TV.

1496
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:46,480
你多快能弄到一台?
Well, how fast can you get one?

1497
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,690
你送我去电器商店最快要多久?
How fast can you get me to an electronics store?

1498
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:50,690
我? 现在佛罗里达交通空前拥堵
Me? In the worst traffic in Florida history.

1499
01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:51,940
走不开 得给大家做准备
I can't. I have to prep the guys.

1500
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,400
把钥匙给我
Give me the keys.

1501

Oh, my God. I can't go to jail.

1523
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,280
交给我
Let me handle this.

1524
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,280
(警察)

She's good.

1526

是啊
Yeah.

1527
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:16,170
一路顺风 兄弟们
Have a good ride, boys.

1528
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:23,550
大约五分钟后
In a matter of, uh, five minutes or so

1529
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:26,430
我们将看到飞船指挥官尼尔·阿姆斯特朗
we'll be ready for the spacecraft commander, Neil Armstrong,

1530
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:29,730
跨过位于98米高空的舷门门槛
to come across the sill at the 320-foot level.

1531
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:47,370
搭乘穿梭面包车... 快啊
The trip in the transfer van... Come on!

1532
01:34:47,370 --> 01:34:50,330
大约要15分钟才能抵达发射平台
Could take some 15 minutes or so to reach the pad.

1533
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:54,460
届时 宇航员将搭乘 两部电梯中先来的那部
At which time the astronauts will board, uh, the first of two elevators

1534
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:58,800
前往发射平台所在的98米高空
for the trip to the 320-foot level at the launchpad,

1535
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,380
然后进入飞船
uh, where they will then proceed to ingress the spacecraft.

1536
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:07,970
站住 已经准备就绪了 小伙子
Whoa. We are locked and loaded, kid.

1537
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,810
不... 飞行部要把这个放进飞船
No, no. Flight Deck wants this on the ship.

1538
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,440
这里飞行部 放他过去 好
This is Flight Deck. Let him through. Got it.

1539
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,440
去吧
Go.

1540
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,990
好 我们必须启动发射前的程序了 否则会错过窗口期
Okay, we need to initiate prelaunch, or we lose the window.

1541
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:23,030
给他一分钟就好
Just give him one minute.

1542
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:24,610
... 98米的高空
320-foot level,

1543
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:27,450
三位宇航员都已登上飞船
all three astronauts now aboard the spacecraft.

1544
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:30,870
几分钟前 宇航员巴兹·奥尔德林 进来坐在了中间的位置
A few minutes ago, Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, uh, came in and took the center seat...

1545
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:35,460
我听说船舱已经封闭 倒计时开始了
I'm hearing the cabin's now being sealed. Countdown has begun.

1546
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:38,540
这是他们发射时的姿态
These are the positions they will fly at liftoff.

1547
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:41,210
指挥官 这里是飞船测试员 听得清楚吗?
CDR, STC, how do you read?

1548
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:43,090
飞船测试员 听得很清楚
STC, loud and clear.

1549
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:45,340
早上好 尼尔 发射架已撤开
Good morning, Neil. Gantry is cleared.

1550
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:46,510
欢迎登船
Welcome aboard.

1551
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:49,890
阿波罗11号准备发射 倒计时十分钟
Apollo 11 is a go for launch in T-minus ten minutes.

1552
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:51,720
好
Okay.

1553
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:56,810
他回来了
He's here.

1554
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:58,980
接上了
It's connected.

1555
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:01,280
至少我认为接上了
At least I think I connected it.

1556
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:04,320
斯图 什么意思?
Stu, what the hell does that mean?

1557
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,950
我只有几秒钟时间 没来得及进行压力测试 我...
I only had a few seconds. I didn't have time to stress test it. I...

1558
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,330
好 坐下吧
Okay. Sit down.

1559
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:18,790
好 都听着
All right, listen up!

1560
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:26,430
无论今天这里发生什么
Whatever happens here today,

1561
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:29,430
我都会支持你们做出的每一个决定
I will stand by every decision that you make.

1562
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:34,020
近十年来 超过四十万人参与了这项计划
Over 400,000 people have worked on this program for nearly ten years.

1563
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,270
就为了实现一个人对全世界的承诺
All to keep one man's promise to the world.

1564
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:38,860
让我们坚守这个承诺吧
So, let's keep it.

1565
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:44,400
好了 告诉我发射是否就绪吧
All right. Give me, "Go/No go" for launch.

1566
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:47,150
收到 所有岗位 准备进行最后的就绪核查
Ah, roger. All stations, stand by for final "Go/No go."

1572
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:56,290
航天器控制系统 这里最精彩了
SCS. This is the best part.

1573
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:59,040
他们依次问下去 每一个...
They go down the line and every single...

1574
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,170
每一个技术员都必须说 发射“就绪”或“未就绪”
every single technician has to say, "Go," or, "No go," for launch.

1575
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:03,590
任何一人都能阻止发射
Any one of them can stop it.

1576
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,050
CFAT CSE 现在能回答“就绪”了吗?
CFAT. CSE, can you give me a "go" now?

1577
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:08,130
CSE就绪
CSE is go.

1578
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,350
好 鹰号就绪
Okay. Uh, Eagle is go.

1579
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,780
CBTS 这里是CSA9号
CBTS, this is CSA 9.

1580
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,740
倒计时20秒
Twenty seconds and counting.

1581

1583
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,170
点火程序启动
Ignition sequence starts.

1584
01:37:55,350 --> 01:38:00,100
五 四 三 二 一
Five, four, three, two, one.

1585
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,600
所有引擎启动
All engines running.

1586
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:32,260
发射 火箭升空
Liftoff. We have liftoff.

1587
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:41,390
发射塔已分离
Tower clear.

1588
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,270
休斯敦 交给你了
Houston, she's all yours.

1589
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,890
莫·伯克斯来了 要找你们俩
Moe Berkus is here. For both of you.

1590
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,470
阿波罗11号已经升空
Apollo 11 is on the way.

1591
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,560
四十万公里之外
250,000 miles away,

1592
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,860
月球在等待人类的首次到来
where the moon is waiting for man's first arrival.

1593
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:11,070
整个航程要用三天时间
Flight to take, uh, three days.

1594
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:14,530
飞船要抵达...
And, uh, the, uh, spacecraft to reach there...

1595
01:40:14,530 --> 01:40:16,070
凯莉全都告诉我了
Kelly told me everything.

1596
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,370
好极了
Bravissimo.

1597
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:23,120
省省吧 这是创造历史
Shove it. That was history.

1598
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,370
嗨 海伦 抱歉 是凯莉
Hi, Helen. Uh, sorry, Kelly.

1599
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:28,790
我听说你回来了 所以我也回来了
I heard you came back, so I came back too.

1600
01:40:30,670 --> 01:40:34,720
我... 去月球片场看了一眼
I... I took a little peeky-poo at the moon set,

1601
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,510
真是完美
and it is perfection.

1602
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:39,010
干得好
Great job.

1603
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:42,220
如果你认为我会让你播出 这次任务的造假版本
If you think that I'm gonna let you broadcast some fake version of this,

1604
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:43,720
那我现在就去找媒体
I'll go to the press right now.

1605
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:45,730
科尔
Cole.

1606
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,190
科尔...
Cole. Cole.

1607
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:56,700
你... 去找媒体吧 带他们看看月球片场
You, uh... You go to the press. Bring 'em by the moon set,

1608
01:40:57,570 --> 01:41:02,530
但你要知道 今后再也不会有人相信国家航空航天局了
but just know that no one will ever trust the legitimacy of NASA again.

1609
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:05,540
这是国家安全问题
This is a matter of national security.

1610
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:08,790
本次直播必须在可控的情况下进行
This broadcast must take place in a controlled setting.

1611
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:11,380
你应该最明白了
You of all people must understand that.

1612
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:15,960
任务的重点已经不再是登月了
The mission isn't about landing on the moon anymore.

1613
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:21,550
而是全世界在电视上观看美国战胜苏联
It is about the world watching America beat Russia on TV.

1614
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:29,270
我得赶飞机
I got a flight to catch.

1615
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:36,150
我会及时赶回来看登月直播的
I'll be back in time for the lunar broadcast.

1616
01:41:36,150 --> 01:41:37,650
我想在这里看
I thought I'd watch it here.

1617
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:40,990
凯莉 和你一起在月球片场看
With you, Kelly. On the moon.

1618
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,790
嘿 我们正在创造历史
Hey. We're making history.

1619
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:26,040
你说我的那些话全都没错
Everything you said about me is true.

1620
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,580
我是个骗子 一直都是
I'm a con artist, and I always have been.

1621
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:33,460
我的真名甚至不是凯莉
My real name is not even Kelly.

1622
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,380
那些我跟你讲的故事
All those stories that I told you

1623
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,670
说我和我妈挨家挨户推销
about my mom and I selling products door-to-door,

1624
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:41,800
那是真事
those were true.

1625
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:44,140
但都是骗局
They were all scams.

1626
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:47,720
我们开始只是小打小闹 之后越做越大
And we started out small, and then they got bigger.

1627
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:51,350
大到涉及地产和保险什么的
Like real estate and insurance.

1628
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:52,440
然后...
And...

1629
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:58,860
我16岁那年 在北达科他州 有个人掏枪了
when I was 16, a guy in North Dakota pulled a gun

1630
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:01,860
我妈比他更快掏出枪 把他打死了
and my mom pulled hers out first and she killed him.

1631
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:04,910
她叫我逃跑 我照做了
And she told me to run and I did.

1632
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:07,790
她进了监狱 我再也没见过她
And she went to prison and I never saw her again.

1633
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:15,380
我伪造文件 用假名来找工作
And I forged documents and used fake names to get jobs.

1634
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:19,380
我去纽约后发现了广告业
And when I went to New York, I found advertising.

1635
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:23,970
就像我妈教我的骗局 但却合法
And that was like the scams that my mom taught me, but it was legal.

1636
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:29,180
我骗了很多人
And I lied to so many people.

1637
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:32,480
最糟糕的谎言是我对自己说的那些
The worst lies were the ones I told myself.

1638
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:36,190
说所有人都在骗人 这只是一场大型游戏而已
That everybody does it. You know. It's just a big game.

1639
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,150
但后来我来了这里
But then I came down here...

1640
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:44,570
认识了你
I met you.

1641
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,830
我了解到参与到真实事件中是什么感受
I learned what it was like to be a part of something real.

1642
01:43:56,670 --> 01:43:58,960
莫提出的条件是抹去我的黑历史
Moe offered me a way to erase my past.

1643
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,800
我原以为那就是我想要的 但...
I thought that's what I wanted, but...

1644
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:05,890
我不想再逃亡了
I don't wanna run anymore.

1645
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:16,650
莫是个值得尊敬的对手 但他遇到旗鼓相当的人了
Moe is a worthy opponent, but he has met his match.

1646
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:24,780
我保证这是我最后一次 用欺骗的手段来获取我想要的东西
I promise this is the last time I will trick anyone into getting what I want.

1647
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,410
我保证
I promise.

1648
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,620
你觉得不撒谎也能做到吗?
Do you think you can do it without lying?

1649
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:35,620
绝对不行 好吧 我想也是
Absolutely not. Yeah, I didn't think so.

1650
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:42,380
那你有什么计划?
So, what's the plan?

1651
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:46,590
我们为什么在这里碰头?
Why are we meeting out here?

1652
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,800
因为莫监听一切对话 这人就像个魔术师 无处不在
Because Moe bugs everything. The guy's like Houdini. He's everywhere.

1653
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,720
好 莫不知道我们修好了登月舱摄像机
Okay, so, Moe doesn't know that we fixed the LEM camera.

1654
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,180
我们就此来制定计划
We build a plan around that.

1655
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:57,890
我们只需让他相信我们在直播假登月
All we have to do is convince him that we are broadcasting the fake moon landing,

1656
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,020
而实际上我们在播真的
when in reality we're broadcasting the real one.

1657
01:45:00,690 --> 01:45:02,730
我们有没有办法给设备动手脚
Is there a way that we could rig the equipment

1658
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:05,240
来播出真实的登月舱视频?
so that it actually sends out the real LEM video feed?

1659
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:07,240
拜托 两位
Come on, boys.

1660
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,700
你们连登月都搞定了 给我个假设理论啊
You figured out how to land on the moon. Give me a hypothetical.

1661
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:13,580
好 假设的话 我们可以重新接线
Okay, um, hypothetically, we could rewire it.

1662
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:16,250
让设备只接收任务控制中心的播出信号
So that it only picks up the broadcast signal from Mission Control.

1663
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:18,250
好 然后和我们的信号同步 对
Sure, then sync it with our feed. Hmm. Right.

1664
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,210
嘿 各位
Hey, fellas.

1665
01:45:26,050 --> 01:45:28,630
莫·伯克斯派这两位来测试播出信号
Moe Berkus sent these guys to test the broadcast feed.

1666
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,300
莫... 伯克斯 对 莫·伯克斯...
Moe... Moe Berk... Yes. Moe Berk... Moe Berkus.

1667
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:34,430
你们谁都没接到电话?
Telling me none of you got the phone call?

1668
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,060
好极了 摄像机在哪?
Great. All right, where's the camera?

1669
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:42,400
你还好吗?
Are you okay? Mmm.

1670
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,860
请你们快点好吗?
Can you guys hurry up, please?

1671
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,500
唐 你把烟掐了吧
Don, maybe just take the cigarette out.

1672

The LEM footpads are only depressed in the surface about one or two inches,

1802
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:28,610
不过靠近了看 月表的尘土似乎非常细腻
although the surface appears to be very, very fine-grained as you get close to it.

1803
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:33,160

I'm gonna step off the LEM now.

1805
01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:44,800
这是个人的一小步
That's one small step for man...

1806
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:51,720
却是人类的一大步
one giant leap for mankind.

1807
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:59,540
这么精彩的话 我们可能得花好几年才想得出
We could have spent years coming up with something that good.

1808
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:02,190
是的
Yeah.

1809
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:05,570
这是剧本里的吗?
Was that, uh, in the script?

1810
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:07,030
不是
No.

1811
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,530
这句台词不错
That's a good line.

1812
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:17,910
一级一级舷梯跳下来是很简单的
It's a very simple matter to hop down from one step to the next.

1813
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:20,250

Okay.

1821
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:46,110
太往右了
Too much to the right.

1822
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:48,440
能往左4 5度吗?
Can you bring it back left about, uh, four or five degrees?

1823
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,280
好 看起来不错 尼尔
Okay. That looks good, Neil.

1827
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:06,000
宁静海基地 这里是休斯敦

That would be an honor.

1831
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:17,680

I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House...

1835
01:55:25,570 --> 01:55:27,730
这地方到处都是特勤局的人
They have Secret Service all over this place.

1836
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:31,990
这绝对是有史以来最重要的一次通话
And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.

1837
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:34,950
你们跟我们通话的同时...
And as you talk to us...

1838
01:55:34,950 --> 01:55:37,450
我觉得你跟他真的很像
He actually reminds me a lot of you.

1839
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:40,120
别这么说 真的 连玩笑都别开
Do not say that. No, don't even joke about that.

1840
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:45,130
总统发表无聊讲话时我们要待命 别动
We're still holding while the president drones on. Don't move.

1841
01:55:45,130 --> 01:55:46,840
阿姆斯特朗 我主要盯着你
Armstrong, I'm watching you the most.

1842
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:51,170
在这全人类史上无比珍贵的时刻...
For one priceless moment in the whole history of man...

1843
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:52,760
肯尼迪航天中心 我们直接通话吧

1844
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:57,390
科尔 你收到画面了吗?
Cole, are you receiving picture?

1845
01:55:57,390 --> 01:55:59,180
这边的视频信号灯没亮
The video feed light isn't on up here.

1846
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:02,350
尼尔 什么意思? 坏掉了?
Uh, what do you mean, Neil? It's not working?

1847
01:56:02,350 --> 01:56:04,400
那得你来告诉我 你能看到画面吗?
You tell me. Do you see picture?

1848
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:07,310
我们的摄像机发出了电力过载警报
We're getting a power surge warning on the camera.

1849
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:09,780
好像坏了 你还能看到我们吗?
I think it crapped out. Can you still see us?

1850
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:11,780
能 还能看见
Yeah, I can still see you.

1851
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:14,780
稍等 尼尔
Um, one second, Neil.

1852
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,160
尼尔说月球上的视频信号灯没有亮
Neil's saying the video feed light isn't on up there.

1853
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,490
你确定那台摄像机能用?
Are you sure that camera's working?

1854
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:20,700
我安装了新零件 应该没问题的 但...
I installed the new part. It should be working just fine but...

1855
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:23,120
但什么? 但我... 当时赶时间
But what? But I... I was in a rush.

1856
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:25,710
见鬼
Shit.

1857
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:30,500
怎么了?
What's wrong?

1858
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:33,880
我们不确定登月舱上的 摄像机是否运作正常
We're not sure that the camera on the LEM is working.

1859
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:36,510
我觉得播出的画面是你们的
I think that's your feed broadcasting.

1860
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:40,140
电视上的画面和片场一样吗?
Does the feed on your TV look like your set?

1861
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:44,810
我... 看不出是不是我们
I... I can't tell if it's us.

1862
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:47,980
测试一下 让一个特工挥挥手什么的
Test it. Have one of your agents give a little wave or something.

1863
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:51,440
不行 所有人都在这里
I can't. Everyone is here.

1864
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:10,750
这是什么鬼? 我不知道
What the hell is that? I don't know.

1865
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:14,010
他差5厘米就进镜头了
He is two inches away from being on that screen.

1866
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:15,090
是... 2厘米
It's... It's one inch.

1867
01:57:15,090 --> 01:57:16,840
这也是你那该死的剧本里的情节?
Is that in your goddamn script?

1868
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:20,680
约瑟夫 有新加的戏?
Joseph, were there new pages?

1869
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:23,430
不仅代表美国
Representing not only the United States

1870
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:25,690
也代表所有国家热爱和平的人

任何人把此事透露出去
Anyone mentions this to anyone,

1926
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:32,660
就会在一个无名岛上阴暗的牢房里
you will spend the rest of your life in a dark, dank prison cell

Can I talk with you a moment?

1937
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:06,570
没有多少人违抗了我的命令
Not many people have gone against my orders

1938
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:07,990
还能活命的
and lived to talk about it.

1939
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:11,700
不过话说回来 也没有多少人救过我
Then again, not many people have saved my ass.

1940
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:15,830
要解释月球上为什么有只猫 那可太难了
It would've been a real doozy to explain how the cat ended up on the moon.

1941
02:01:16,830 --> 02:01:18,920
你真是个美国英雄
You're a goddamn American hero.

1942
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,460
干得好
Great job.

1943
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:26,220
好了 现在这里到处都是媒体
Now, this place is crawling with press.

1944
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:30,510
溅落之前 我们无法清理这里
So, uh, we can't really clear anything out until after splashdown.

1945
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:35,100
在这期间呢 把一切和拍摄有关的文件全部销毁
In the meantime, shred any documents associated with the shoot.

1946
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:38,690
你的名字会从史册中抹去
Your name will be wiped from the history books.

1947
02:01:38,690 --> 02:01:41,110
过往将被重写
The story, rewritten.

1948
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:45,150
那我可以走了 是的
Then I'm free to go. You are.

1949
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:52,080
不过呢 有个未来的项目 我需要你这样的人帮忙
Although, I could use someone like you for an upcoming project.

1950
02:01:53,790 --> 02:01:54,910
不 谢了
No, thanks.

1951
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:57,580
你随意吧 我不理解 但没问题
Suit yourself. Hard to get, but okay.

1952
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:05,130
如果需要我 喊一声就行 我可能会听见
If you ever need me... just holler. I'm probably listening.

1953
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:13,060
莫
Oh. Moe.

1954
02:02:16,060 --> 02:02:17,940
真有外星人吗?
Are there really aliens out there?

1955
02:02:20,690 --> 02:02:22,190
外星人就生活在我们中间
They walk among us.

1956
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:29,570
带我飞向月球
Fly me to the moon

1957
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:34,240
让我们在群星中嬉戏
Let's play among the stars

1958
02:02:34,990 --> 02:02:40,500
让我看看木星和火星上春天的样子
Let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars...

1959
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:42,420
四十万公里
A quarter of a million miles.

1960
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:44,880
想想尼尔·阿姆斯特朗的话
Just think of it as, uh, Neil Armstrong said,

1961
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:48,380
人类踏上月球时的第一句话
the first words as man stepped foot on the moon,

1962
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:52,930
“这是个人的一小步 却是人类的一大步”
"A small step for man, a giant leap for mankind."

1963
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:55,930
这一天不会再有了
And a day that can never come again.

1964
02:02:55,930 --> 02:02:59,270
这一天和这一句话将永远载入史册
A day that shall forever live in history, as will those words,

1965
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:01,310
会被学生们记住
which will be memorized by schoolboys...

1966
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:04,940
阿姆斯特朗 你很有前途 不过不是演戏 天啊 绝对不是
Armstrong, you've got a future. Not in acting. My God, no.

1967
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:08,360
凯莉 帕蒂... 是叫帕蒂吧?
Well, Kelly, Patty... Patty, right?

1968
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:10,030
我叫露比 好
My name is Ruby. Uh-huh.

1969
02:03:10,030 --> 02:03:11,780
我们成功了 不 我们没成功
We did it. No, we didn't.

1970
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,460
这里是近陆地单位
This is, uh, landward here.

1971
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:26,130
游泳1号看到阿波罗号了
Uh, Swim One has Apollo visual.

1972
02:03:26,130 --> 02:03:28,590
如果它正在14.5公里外下降
Well, if it's coming down nine miles away,

1973
02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:31,970
那将会刚好落在能见度极限范围内
uh, that's just going to be at the, uh, outer limit of, uh, visibility...

1974
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:33,760
加油... 宝贝...
Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

1975
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:51,780
他们从月球返回了
They're back from the moon.

1976
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:54,410
宇航员阿姆斯特朗 奥尔德林和柯林斯
Astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins

1977
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:57,910
降落在太平洋 夏威夷的西南方
landing in the Pacific Ocean, southwest of Hawaii.

1978
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,170
我想你应该抽一支烟
I guess you deserve a cigarette.

1979
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:10,510
朋友 是... 我...
Aw, buddy. Yeah, yeah. I, uh...

1980
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:17,180
我不想在里面失控
I didn't wanna lose it in there. You know?

1981
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:20,850
我知道你不希望带摄像机登月
You know, I know you didn't want the camera up there,

1982
02:04:20,850 --> 02:04:24,270
但是 天啊 看到那画面...
but, man, seeing that was, uh...

1983
02:04:25,770 --> 02:04:28,070
足以改变人生
It was life-changing.

1984
02:04:29,190 --> 02:04:31,570
我们成功了 是的... 哥们
We did it. We did. We did, man.

1985
02:04:33,450 --> 02:04:36,240
嘿 现在1969年 对吧? 我们在这个十年内做到了
Hey, it's 1969, right? We got it in before the decade.

1986
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:39,240
是啊 踩着时间线呢 是的 我们成功了
I know. Not a moment to spare. Oh. Yeah, we did.

1987
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:41,000
瞧 那是谁 嘿
Look who it is. Hey.

1988
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,250
去吧 走吧 好
Go. Get out of here. Yeah.

1989
02:04:47,290 --> 02:04:50,130
听着 你也不晚 小子
Listen, uh, it's not too late for you either, kid.

1993
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:03,810
嗨 孩子们

把人送上了月球
Sent a man to the moon.

I never did catch your name.

苏联人说
You know, the Russians, they... they're saying

2000
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:51,400
整个登月过程是我们在摄影棚里拍的
that we shot the whole thing on a soundstage.

2001
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,820
真不知道这种疯狂的想法是从哪来的
I wonder where they got a crazy idea like that.

2002
02:05:55,070 --> 02:05:56,450
谁在乎他们怎么想啊?
Who cares what they think?

2003
02:05:57,990 --> 02:06:00,830
就算没人相信 真相依然是真相
Truth is still the truth even if nobody believes it.

2004
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:05,330
就算所有人都信 谎言依然是谎言
Lie is still a lie even if everybody believes it.

2005
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:09,670
你这次做得真完美
You know, you really nailed this.

2006
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:13,840
连月尘都如此逼真
All the way down to the lunar dust.

2007
02:06:16,220 --> 02:06:17,630
可惜都是假的
Too bad it's all fake.

2008
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:25,520
这是假的吗?
Was that fake?

2009
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:29,520
不是 感觉非常真实
No, that felt very real.
