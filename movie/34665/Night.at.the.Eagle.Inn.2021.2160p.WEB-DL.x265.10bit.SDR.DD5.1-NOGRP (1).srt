1
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:19,175
You good?

2
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:21,319
I felt that one

3
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:22,946
Why didn't you wake me up?

4
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,582
I tried

5
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:26,050
Not hard enough

6
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:28,785
And here I was thinking you'd say thank you

7
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:29,818
For what?

8
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:33,290
I've been pinching myself the last 10 minutes

9
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:34,425
Oh, Jesus

10
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:36,327
- What?
- Spence

11
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,061
That shits not real

12
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:39,229
Worked, didn't it?

13
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:40,507
Yeah, keep telling yourself that

14
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,565
Look, I wasn't going to pinch your face

15
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:43,942
Anyway, you're like wearing four layers

16
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:45,101
- Wanna take your clothes off?
-Ewe

17
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:46,135
Exactly

18
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:53,344
So what was it this time?

19
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,311
Sarah?

20
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,415
Silent treatment, really?

21
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,124
We're four

22
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,041
I don't remember

23
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,573
Of course you don't

24
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,493
I remember how it felt

25
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:13,569
Vintage

26
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:18,304
Oh yeah, we got turned around at that murdery, down in brattleboro
but

27
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:22,639
We're close, I think

28
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,042
Shit, did we not have

29
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:26,276
The last 20 miles

30
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:30,513
What do you think I'm using a map by choice?

31
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,547
Come on

32
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:40,056
You know what you need?

33
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,826
- Chocolate
- Chocolate

34
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,461
I also need beer

35
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,064
Of course you do

36
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:49,266
Of course you do

37
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:51,043
I hope my balls wont shrivel up in this cold

38
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,669
Don't tell me about your balls

39
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,291
Hello?

40
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,689
Yep

41
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:48,225
My dick shrunk like six inches

42
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:49,159
Gross

43
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:50,528
There was no one in there

44
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:52,463
Its free, baby

45
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,930
Lets go

46
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:23,086
It's bigger than I thought it would be

47
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,387
- That's what
- Don't

48
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,156
That's what I was gonna say too

49
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:28,324
Perv

50
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,469
357 miles outside of Philadelphia

51
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,971
29 degrees fahrenheit

52
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,909
And one car in the lot

53
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:47,365
Ours

54
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,828
Seriously?

55
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:49,812
Don't be jealous

56
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:52,850
I got you one too

57
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,361
It's always good to have individual recordings

58
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:58,554
God, your confidence in pilgrimage is

59
00:05:58,587 --> 00:05:59,587
Contagious?

60
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:01,623
Admirable

61
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:05,226
Thank you

62
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,599
Look, its not that I think that

63
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:10,796
It's fine, every duo need a skeptic

64
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,569
That's not what I mean

65
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:13,770
I'm glad you're here

66
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:16,137
Obviously

67
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:22,045
Look Spence
I think we'll find something, I do

68
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:25,215
Its just Don't want you to be disappointed if its not

69
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,022
Its not what?

70
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:36,827
Let's get inside

71
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,329
The colds getting worse

72
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:11,695
And there is no bell

73
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:13,163
Ding, ding, bitch

74
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,865
Do we have a reservation or?

75
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,269
No, their website strucking like 2003

76
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,971
And they're obviously not on Expedia, either

77
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,874
How do we know this place is still running?

78
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:24,942
I called ahead

79
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:26,142
They old guy on the other end

80
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:27,678
Said that they We're walk-in only

81
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,046
Afternoon, folks

82
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:33,050
Well, you look exactly like I thought you would

83
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:35,185
Searching for a place to rest your head?

84
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,255
Wow, you're really horny for this vibe

85
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,925
He's quite the comedian, isn't he?

86
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:50,118
Please excuse my brother, yes

87
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:52,168
Two rooms, one night

88
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:54,571
Ah, ah

89
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:56,707
Unfortunately we've only got the one

90
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,593
But I'm happy to say its a suite

91
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:02,512
And I'll certainly give you the upgrade free of charge

92
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,014
So does that mean?

93
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:06,149
Like breakfast in bed?

94
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:08,060
Aha!

95
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:10,488
We offer all the amenities

96
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:35,878
Here you, up, almost forgot

97
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:40,083
Before the transaction is complete,

98
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,185
Oh, watch that there

99
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,943
will you both be so kind to sign the guest-book?

100
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:49,123
Eagle inn tradition

101
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,363
- Sure
- Cool

102
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:53,667
Got a pen?

103
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,923
Oh, yes

104
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:59,016
Its a bit formal, but do the trick

105
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,939
Hold on a minute, if I can find it

106
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:02,972
There we are

107
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,250
Its a fountain pen

108
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:08,782
I don't super care

109
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:19,341
Good to feel connected to those who came before you

110
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:20,257
Not totally

111
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,290
Don't you think?

112
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:25,526
Spencer

113
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,098
How do you?

114
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,411
I heard you two talking outside

115
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:32,435
Scared you though, didn't I?

116
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:47,088
Excellent

117
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:51,607
will you two care for a stroll around the property before it gets dark?

118
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:53,656
- Er
- Sure

119
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,861
We didn't pay you

120
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,930
Okay

121
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,642
Hope you're warm enough

122
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,635
I Don't think I brought enough warm stuff for this

123
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:08,971
Back when we opened in 87

124
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,640
This was quite the hideaway

125
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,476
When did the shift happen?

126
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:14,710
Ah

127
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,279
You mean when did people stop coming?

128
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:19,675
It was back in 94

129
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:23,806
New interstate about destroyed on walk in market

130
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:26,323
How have you managed to stay afloat?

131
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:28,624
Struck a deal with a developer

132
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:31,927
Quite, quite fortuitous actually

133
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,296
Teal estates crazy, huh?

134
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:37,733
Must've been beautiful back then

135
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,603
It still is in its own way

136
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:42,921
Speaking of beautiful, snack attack

137
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:45,241
Hows it going today, Dean?

138
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:53,883
Shut up

139
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:54,850
No, no, no
I think I get the appeal

140
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,220
Jack of all trades, that boy

141
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:00,095
He like to keep up appearances around here

142
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,758
Well, he is doing just fine with that

143
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,495
Sometimes feels like he's the one running the place

144
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:07,664
- Oh yeah
- Jesus

145
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:09,365
Much warmer inside

146
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,435
Spence, give me the keys

147
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,546
I left something in the car

148
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,871
More luggage?

149
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:16,138
Just something personal

150
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:17,650
I've got pillows and blankets and towels

151
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:18,842
She said it personal

152
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,381
You better hurry, dark soon

153
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,550
- I'll see you in there
- Okay

154
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:23,673
So you said you're all booked up tonight?

155
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:25,007
Uh huh

156
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,977
So where is everyone?

157
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:28,944
Early to bed, early to rise

158
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:31,680
God it's like Norman Rockwell fucked the crypt keeper

159
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:32,815
It sounds like you're type

160
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,225
The oldest I ever dated was forty-five

161
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:35,393
And that's only because he has really good skin

162
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,621
Your accommodations, follow in

163
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:39,823
Thanks

164
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,228
Place is really cute

165
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:51,000
You didn't mention anything about there only be one bed

166
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,835
Is there any way that we can have

167
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,580
There's absolutely no one else staying in this hotel

168
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:56,906
No way in hell

169
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,783
I mean there's literally no one else in the parking lot

170
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:01,010
So where do you think hes keeping the bodies?

171
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:02,279
I Don't think its that

172
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:05,356
I think he just has like a weird fetish
for nostalgia or something

173
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:06,990
Makes sense

174
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,821
Listen, if you end up feeling weird
and want to go or something

175
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:14,557
I'll let you know

176
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:17,392
Great

177
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:19,429
The documents in order?

178
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:20,494
Yeah, they're over here

179
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,464
Great

180
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:22,699
Lets do this

181
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:23,732
So

182
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:27,927
The medical report said that dad was gone

183
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:30,040
By the time the ambulance showed up

184
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:34,144
Mom had been dead two hours

185
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:36,044
and blood was cold

186
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:39,215
Shit, I should be recording this

187
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,026
You know a phone can do that these days
Right?

188
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,452
Thank you so much for the feedback

189
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:43,484
Ignoring it

190
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:47,858
December 20th, 1994

191
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:51,664
Joseph and Mary Elizabeth moss enjoy a quiet retreat

192
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,396
Near the Canadian border

193
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,591
A final romantic getaway

194
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,975
Before the birth of their firstborn child

195
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:00,569
Spoiler alert

196
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:02,271
It's twins

197
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,247
You got your number of turn

198
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,864
Gross

199
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,348
On their long journey home,

200
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:13,949
an unexpected blizzard

201
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:14,983
Nor-easter

202
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:16,887
Who's telling the story?

203
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,320
Facts are facts, sis

204
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:19,998
Okay, and how many liberties have you taken?

205
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:21,190
I'm dramatizing

206
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,626
But if the informations out there

207
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,694
Okay, an unexpected nor-easter and a wrong turn

208
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:28,698
Send them on a winding path down the mountain

209
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,001
Where they happen upon the eagle inn

210
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:36,105
Seeking refuge from the wind and snow

211
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,138
They check in

212
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:42,513
Pausing

213
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:43,880
No, no, no

214
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:44,912
Keep it going

215
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,551
Hello?

216
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,460
Mr Moss, pardon the interruption

217
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,933
But I neglected to mention that We're serving cocktails

218
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,119
and other assorted libations in the library

219
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,844
A happy hour of sorts

220
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:01,046
Cool!

221
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:03,327
- We do hope you and your lovely sister
- What is it?

222
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:04,785
- Can join us
- More booze

223
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,223
Once again, once again

224
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:08,073
All amenities are included

225
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,614
will you be there?

226
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,573
Yes?

227
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:13,742
Ah, yeah, sure

228
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:15,311
Sounds good, cant wait

229
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:17,314
Excellent

230
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,040
Its done

231
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:52,748
So weird

232
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:53,816
Continue

233
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:54,750
That night,

234
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:56,251
A month before shes due,

235
00:15:56,285 --> 00:16:02,480
Mary Elizabeth suddenly goes into labor at the stroke of midnight

236
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,693
Duh duh duh

237
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,026
Ooh

238
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,564
And after shock from the storm perhaps

239
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:09,833
Or something far more sinister

240
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,201
See, that's traumatizing

241
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:14,204
After an excruciating night,

242
00:16:14,237 --> 00:16:16,164
The twins are born safely

243
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:18,010
But Mary Elizabeth is not so lucky

244
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:21,088
Taken by sepsis at dawn

245
00:16:23,311 --> 00:16:25,268
The night manager phones the local authorities

246
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:27,117
But its days before they can reach them

247
00:16:27,142 --> 00:16:29,753
Or, whats left of them

248
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:34,024
God, how could you be so morbid about this?

249
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:35,281
Tragedy plus time

250
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,928
When the authorities finally arrive

251
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:42,712
Joseph was nowhere to be found

252
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:47,003
Impossible, but true

253
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:52,442
We're here tonight to see if we can find anything

254
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,344
That speaks to this disappearance

255
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,879
And perhaps

256
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:03,176
Find some form of closure for the tragedy that
has haunted the moss family for decades

257
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:06,386
And scene

258
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,777
There's a remote under the pillow

259
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:23,895
Of course

260
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:14,623
- Drinks?
- Yeah

261
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:16,393
Yeah, yeah

262
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:23,165
You first

263
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:23,999
Yeah, right

264
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,076
Oh, come on

265
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,158
What are the odds that if we both take a drink
Oh, nothings stopping you, go right ahead

266
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:30,840
Drink up, buddy, its your funeral

267
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:32,174
Listen, I Don't think

268
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,786
He didn't roofie it or anything
if that's what you're worried about

269
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:36,745
Oh yeah

270
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:37,579
No

271
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:38,815
Sorry

272
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:39,757
I wasn't trying to insinuate that

273
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:40,883
Yeah, you We're

274
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:43,202
Look, I get it

275
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,055
Weird fucking dude

276
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:48,324
But, the stuffs all top shelf

277
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:50,926
Well aged

278
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:54,164
By product of nobody staying here anymore

279
00:18:55,597 --> 00:18:58,631
So we are the only ones here

280
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:00,969
Obviously

281
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:04,406
Why say that there's only one room then?

282
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Maintenance

283
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:08,745
Right, he,

284
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:11,079
he said that

285
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:12,414
Sorry

286
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:13,949
What did you say your name was?

287
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,152
Dean

288
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:18,188
- Spencer
- Sarah

289
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:24,058
You,

290
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:26,700
you We're born second

291
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,334
Well?

292
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:34,736
- Actually
- We Don't know

293
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,006
Really?

294
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:39,350
Isn't that like a sense of pride with you guys or something?

295
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:40,609
How did you know that we We're?

296
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,042
Well, you're obviously not a couple

297
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:45,121
Drink anybody?

298
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:57,418
So Dean, how long have you been working here?

299
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,629
I'm in and out

300
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:00,563
It depends on the season

301
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:01,964
Do people still go missing?

302
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:05,602
Sure

303
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,836
Weird things happen here, but

304
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,439
its nothing like what you've heard

305
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:12,741
Wanna talk about it?

306
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,177
Wow

307
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,411
You're giving me mad Anderson Cooper vibes right now

308
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:17,446
Thank you

309
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:21,684
You guys aren't reporters, are you?

310
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:22,717
No, this is,

311
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:25,322
its more of a personal project

312
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,860
Eh, why not

313
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:31,892
- Come on
- Great

314
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,267
91

315
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:39,635
92

316
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,799
93

317
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,963
94
hahahahaha

318
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,222
95

319
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:45,975
Keith and Kayla

320
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:47,443
They We're a good couple

321
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,879
Why do I have to do this

322
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:56,318
96

323
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:57,352
97

324
00:20:58,062 --> 00:20:59,070
I'm so close
98

325
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:00,173
I'm so close

326
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:03,837
So close

327
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:31,226
Hahahahahahahahahahaha

328
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,358
I Don't what to freak you guys out

329
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,125
This place is safe

330
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,895
they're just stories

331
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:40,296
I'm not worried about it

332
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:42,832
1994

333
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:43,665
Shit

334
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:44,499
Sorry

335
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:45,334
Sorry

336
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,301
Ah

337
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:47,303
Still figuring this thing out

338
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:48,738
Canadian border

339
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,106
The final romantic

340
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,775
Okay

341
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:53,807
Ready

342
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:55,809
Yeah

343
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:00,449
You're the kids

344
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:04,887
I didn't know we had a reputation,

345
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,456
Let alone one that preceded us

346
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:09,859
What do you know?

347
00:22:11,293 --> 00:22:13,596
Well, not as much as you,

348
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:15,798
If that's the reason why you're here

349
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:17,734
Everything we know comes from ancestry

350
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:18,843
Comes from microfilm newspaper clippings,

351
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:20,342
And that medical report

352
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,047
We bribed the guy at the county coroners office for on the way up here

353
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:23,071
So

354
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:26,287
Your voice will be a welcome addition to the conversation

355
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,375
Hmm

356
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:31,480
What do you want to know?

357
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:33,291
Something you cant just read about it online

358
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,351
My brothers looking for ghost stuff

359
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,193
I Don't believe in ghosts

360
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,757
Okay, not just ghost stuff

361
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:41,789
Okay, what then?

362
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:43,935
You Don't believe in ghosts?

363
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,395
Souls, energy, sure

364
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:47,429
That's different

365
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:49,931
Enlighten me later

366
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:50,991
I'm just saying that

367
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,676
I know what you're saying and
I'm here to help you find it

368
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,079
Well, it's not just about me, Sarah

369
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:55,132
Its about us

370
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:56,616
- Both of us together, being here
- I know its about both of us

371
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,686
Obviously, its why I'm here

372
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,866
Do you guys want to take a tour?

373
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:00,954
Thanks, Norman Bates already showed us around

374
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,189
No

375
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:05,633
I mean the real tour

376
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:11,988
I got a couple more chores

377
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,855
I got to finish up before I'm off

378
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:15,492
You can tag along if you'd like

379
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:19,533
I

380
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:23,432
I have to take care of something back at the room

381
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:24,417
You go ahead

382
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:25,425
I'll meet up with you later

383
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,366
Are you sure?

384
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:28,236
Yeah

385
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:31,014
Hey, not to be high maintenance,

386
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,409
But Jack Torrance did say assorted libations

387
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:37,780
Not a single bottle of apple Brandy

388
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:39,847
So

389
00:23:40,682 --> 00:23:42,151
Think we can make a pit stop?

390
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:44,687
That can be arranged

391
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,719
Good

392
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:47,423
I'm thirsty

393
00:26:06,996 --> 00:26:09,666
Who's going to be a debutante?

394
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:17,890
Who's going to be the prettiest

395
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:21,476
You are

396
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:26,548
Yes, you're the one

397
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:29,419
You're

398
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:38,227
You will

399
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:39,417
Yeah

400
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:43,132
You will be the one

401
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:48,969
Yes

402
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,241
You'll see

403
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:58,281
You're gonna be the most desirable debutante

404
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:06,167
Sarah

405
00:27:10,104 --> 00:27:11,960
And desirable

406
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:13,763
And just

407
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:17,733
You'll wait, and you'll be great

408
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,773
You'll be perfect

409
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:40,984
I'm so sorry

410
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,933
I'm so sorry

411
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:50,298
Used to be reservation only

412
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:52,010
Saturday nights, you couldn't find a seat in here
if you tried

413
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:54,836
No shit

414
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,127
Yeah

415
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:00,009
That was before my time though

416
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:03,413
So what are you in the market for?

417
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,649
Vodka cran, splash of lime

418
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,601
Preferably in a chilled glass
but I'm flexible

419
00:28:11,652 --> 00:28:13,655
Or just vodka

420
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:15,257
Vodkas fine

421
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:17,492
Actually, you're in luck

422
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,598
You sneaky devil

423
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:26,033
So

424
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:29,438
Your parents,

425
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,141
They stayed here 20 years ago?

426
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:33,776
24

427
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:34,609
Right

428
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:35,642
Yeah

429
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:37,844
Yeah

430
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,816
Not to be a downer, but

431
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:45,719
Not so sure you're going to find something of theirs in the lost and found

432
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:47,989
If that's the missing piece of the puzzle you're looking for

433
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:50,007
Not exactly

434
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,929
We grew up in the foster care system

435
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:58,901
So nobody knew or talked about anything really

436
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,169
This is

437
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,974
I don't know, sometimes just occupying a space

438
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:08,177
Is enough to put you in the right frame of mind

439
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:12,546
To what?

440
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:15,616
See things differently

441
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:18,652
Hmm

442
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:23,658
Let me know

443
00:29:27,563 --> 00:29:28,633
Stronger?

444
00:29:30,465 --> 00:29:31,500
It's stronger

445
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,202
Oh no, no, no, no, it's good

446
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:34,536
Nah, that's all right

447
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:35,569
I already am

448
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,911
So you live here?

449
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:43,777
Mostly

450
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,748
Kind of part of the deal

451
00:29:48,182 --> 00:29:50,051
Must get pretty lonely

452
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:51,084
Eh,

453
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,589
As soon as things quiet down a bit

454
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:54,990
Something else pops up

455
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:56,923
Like clockwork

456
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:01,863
Oof, shes a squirter

457
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:07,570
Try that one out for size

458
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:15,977
Better?

459
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:17,880
Much

460
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:18,912
Hmm

461
00:30:19,882 --> 00:30:22,294
I'm going to go get out of this monkey suit

462
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,319
I'll be back

463
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:25,019
Do you want me to?

464
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:26,856
You just take a seat,

465
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:28,457
Relax

466
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:30,692
You're on vacation

467
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:41,303
First one was better

468
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:56,451
Nothing too suspicious yet,

469
00:30:56,485 --> 00:31:01,223
But something in the atmosphere definitely seems off

470
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:05,628
Some kind of nondescript gloom

471
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:06,698
Hanging over the place

472
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:07,723
It's

473
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:12,334
Oh, shit

474
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,729
Oh

475
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,369
He did make it stronger, wow

476
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:16,721
God

477
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:19,699
Okay

478
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,471
My name is Sarah moss

479
00:32:22,504 --> 00:32:24,972
My brother is Spencer moss

480
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:29,342
We're at the eagle inn

481
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:32,597
We drove here

482
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,750
From Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

483
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,723
None of this is real

484
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,799
This isn't real

485
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:45,920
This can't be real

486
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:21,036
Dean?

487
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,962
I'll be there in a minute

488
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:32,374
Man enters

489
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,567
He puts on what seems to be peanut butter

490
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:49,792
Childs voice somewhere in the distance

491
00:33:56,565 --> 00:33:59,301
Spreads the peanut butter across the bread

492
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:07,772
I don't know what hes doing here
I don't

493
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,451
Pulls a paper out of his pocket and takes

494
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:18,220
Takes out a pill

495
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:19,588
I'm so sorry

496
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:24,433
Don't know what this powder is
that he's

497
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,458
I'm so sorry

498
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,564
I'm so sorry

499
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:40,175
I'm coming

500
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,876
I'll be right there

501
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,149
He leaves

502
00:34:47,182 --> 00:34:48,681
I'll be there in a minute

503
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,621
This is room number

504
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:57,439
Three

505
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:09,149
It's not real

506
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:10,416
It's not real

507
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,027
None of this is real

508
00:37:13,061 --> 00:37:14,029
Wake up

509
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:24,459
I'm sorry

510
00:37:24,484 --> 00:37:26,216
I'm so sorry

511
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:27,657
I'm sorry

512
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,732
I'm coming

513
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:31,221
I'll be right there

514
00:38:00,164 --> 00:38:01,626
Down here

515
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:05,311
Dean?

516
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,724
You can do this, you can do this

517
00:39:34,793 --> 00:39:36,128
Do it

518
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,170
Do it

519
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:58,054
What the fuck!

520
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,401
Dammit!

521
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:31,148
- Spencer!
- Sarah!

522
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:32,820
Sarah!

523
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:34,486
- Spencer!
- Sarah!

524
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:36,438
- Oh my god
- Oh my god, are you okay?

525
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:37,707
I'm so sorry I brought you here

526
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:38,975
Sarah, I'm so sorry I brought you here

527
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:42,231
Dean ditched me
And I saw the guy at the front desk and he was cutting his wrist with a box cutter!

528
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:43,537
Shh, shh, shh

529
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,605
Listen, listen

530
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,639
Listen, listen, listen

531
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:48,452
What?

532
00:40:48,477 --> 00:40:49,429
Sarah, what is it?

533
00:40:49,454 --> 00:40:50,272
No, no, no

534
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:51,186
Listen, listen, listen

535
00:40:54,682 --> 00:40:56,189
They are other people in this hotel?

536
00:40:56,214 --> 00:40:57,205
Sort of

537
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,508
They're, they're
Its like they're in the

538
00:40:58,533 --> 00:41:00,174
They're in the tvs

539
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,623
And they're in the tvs

540
00:41:01,648 --> 00:41:02,456
Fuck, the tvs

541
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,409
Sarah, Sarah,

542
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:04,543
- We gotta get out of here Come on
- Okay

543
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:05,559
We gotta

544
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:06,817
Sarah, I'm so sorry I brought you here

545
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,771
Sarah, I'm so sorry I brought you here

546
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,629
It's like they We're,

547
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:11,832
They We're trapped or something

548
00:41:11,857 --> 00:41:13,126
There wasn't anything they could do

549
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:14,182
I may not be the skeptic here,

550
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:15,740
But I did not plan for this shit

551
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:17,738
Shit, keys?

552
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:19,297
- Oh
- Shit, shit

553
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:21,580
- Over here, over here
- Shit, shit, shit

554
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,077
Wait

555
00:41:27,046 --> 00:41:28,149
Just hold my hand

556
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:31,393
It'll be over and it'll be fine

557
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,757
I Don't think I can do it

558
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:39,960
Stop, stop

559
00:41:39,994 --> 00:41:43,231
They're getting faster

560
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:44,260
Oh my god

561
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:45,370
Joseph

562
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:46,331
You shouldn't have come

563
00:41:47,774 --> 00:41:48,942
Dude

564
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,568
How the hell did you get in here?

565
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:53,909
You can't leave

566
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:54,941
No one can

567
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:57,654
What do you mean we can't leave?

568
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,079
The hotel, it does something to people

569
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:02,849
Does what?

570
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:05,686
You're going to need these

571
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,505
Come on, Spence, lets go

572
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:11,881
You're not going to make it very far before you find yourself right back here

573
00:42:13,494 --> 00:42:14,392
Believe me

574
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:15,259
I've tried

575
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,103
Thanks

576
00:42:16,128 --> 00:42:17,264
Well take our chances

577
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,456
- Mother
- Fucker

578
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:28,442
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know

579
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:29,276
Cell phones don't work

580
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:30,136
Just landline

581
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:32,323
No, it doesn't dial out

582
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:33,148
Plus we got Manny Wilkes playing operator on the other end

583
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,182
Oh, dammit

584
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,952
What if we just ran?

585
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:37,786
Ran where?

586
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:39,176
I don't really, down the road somewhere

587
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:40,520
I don't know, there's gotta be a place, right

588
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:41,456
It's freezing outside

589
00:42:41,488 --> 00:42:42,923
Yeah, so run fast

590
00:42:42,956 --> 00:42:45,368
Well, where are we even going to go?
We're in the middle of nowhere

591
00:42:45,392 --> 00:42:46,360
What about the gas station?

592
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:47,604
That's like 20 miles from here

593
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:48,764
Again, running

594
00:42:50,231 --> 00:42:52,237
Okay, fine
Sure, whatever, lets go

595
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:54,068
Wait, Sarah

596
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:55,101
Sarah

597
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,551
- We're just gonna leave all our shits in the car?
- Yep

598
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:58,535
Okay

599
00:42:58,654 --> 00:43:00,576
- Fuck
- Its freezing

600
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:09,553
Shit

601
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:11,386
- Shit Shit
- No, no, no, no

602
00:43:11,418 --> 00:43:12,219
Shit

603
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:13,253
God dammit

604
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:16,227
What the hell?

605
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:23,759
Fuck

606
00:43:24,865 --> 00:43:26,604
Twilight zone beat you too it, asshole

607
00:43:26,629 --> 00:43:27,683
What?

608
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,747
The inescapable loop back to hell

609
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:30,905
Season five, episode 30

610
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:32,116
They did it better

611
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:33,023
Yeah

612
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:34,070
Sorry about that

613
00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:35,617
Dean, what the hell is this place?

614
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:38,045
If I told you something supernatural, would you

615
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,214
Believe you?

616
00:43:39,246 --> 00:43:40,648
- Yeah
- Obviously

617
00:43:40,674 --> 00:43:44,852
I don't know if you remember a 30 minutes ago

618
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:47,102
All right, all right, all right

619
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:48,990
Glad We're on the same page

620
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:51,983
Why didn't you tell us any of this?

621
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:52,858
Its against the rules

622
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:53,834
Oh, great

623
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:54,717
Well, none of you're breaking them,

624
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:57,569
If you could, please continue
so at least I know how I'm going to die before it actually happens

625
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:58,437
Easy

626
00:43:58,462 --> 00:44:01,978
The inn attracts the wayward, those who have lost their way

627
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:03,280
Or searching for something

628
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:04,209
Great, great

629
00:44:04,234 --> 00:44:05,704
We love a spiritual death trap

630
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:09,257
- Whose side are you on?
- Don't answer that

631
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:13,620
Hello?

632
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:14,847
And he fucking answered it

633
00:44:14,872 --> 00:44:17,620
Good evening, Mr. Moss, just checking in to see if there's anything I can do for ya

634
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:19,987
Bubble bath, midnight snack, bedtime story

635
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:21,856
As I said, we have all the amenities

636
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,325
You see the amount of books we have here

637
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:27,074
I hit all the inflections, whatever you want me to read, I'll read for you

638
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,809
That sounds great, yes, that too, uh huh

639
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,473
I'm quite the reader, Mr. Moss

640
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:31,674
Don't underestimate me

641
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:34,004
You like drama, comedy, fiction, non-fiction?

642
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:35,269
I can do it all

643
00:44:35,302 --> 00:44:38,246
And feel like a dip in the pool for your last night
for ah, yeah

644
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,373
I think you'll enjoy it

645
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:40,647
I have hiking cream by the way,

646
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:41,676
Gets in between the toes

647
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,643
Yeah, yeah, yeah

648
00:44:42,677 --> 00:44:44,497
- That all sounds
- And how about the misses Sarah she do??

649
00:44:44,522 --> 00:44:46,411
Is there anything I can do for her?
No?

650
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,414
Shes shes asleep,

651
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:49,328
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right, you're right
It is your sister

652
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,718
Oh, you know what? That actually sounds, that sounds really awesome right now,

653
00:44:51,743 --> 00:44:52,737
But we have kind of a

654
00:44:52,762 --> 00:44:55,066
A killer schedule this evening, kind of wall to wall

655
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:55,989
You know, We're really booked up

656
00:44:56,014 --> 00:44:58,317
So if anything comes up, we'll be sure to let you know

657
00:44:58,342 --> 00:44:59,661
Your generosity is very much appreciated, thank you

658
00:44:59,872 --> 00:45:00,856
What does he want?

659
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:02,450
- He wanted to know if we needed anything
- What?

660
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,143
Hes toying with us, like I'm fricking demented, pepperidge farm spokesperson

661
00:45:06,168 --> 00:45:07,284
What are we gonna do?

662
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:10,287
Hey kids

663
00:45:11,204 --> 00:45:12,235
Dad?

664
00:45:14,084 --> 00:45:16,945
I want you to know how hard its been

665
00:45:16,978 --> 00:45:18,818
Not being able to watch you grow up

666
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:22,099
Every day,

667
00:45:23,684 --> 00:45:26,865
Every single day

668
00:45:29,923 --> 00:45:30,923
Spence,

669
00:45:32,726 --> 00:45:35,796
I hope you've grown up to be a better man than me

670
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,628
Now, you know what?
I...

671
00:45:40,144 --> 00:45:41,316
I know you have

672
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,531
And Sarah bear, I

673
00:45:57,818 --> 00:45:59,989
I cant forgive you for killing her

674
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,090
Your mother

675
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:08,074
My wife

676
00:46:10,798 --> 00:46:12,660
Making me do

677
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:14,731
What I did

678
00:46:19,807 --> 00:46:21,642
It should've been you

679
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:25,049
And you know it

680
00:46:26,546 --> 00:46:27,546
Don't you?

681
00:46:29,749 --> 00:46:31,205
Spencer, yeah,

682
00:46:32,385 --> 00:46:34,555
He came out easy, but you

683
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:38,225
You just had to fight

684
00:46:39,126 --> 00:46:43,072
Had to suck her dry like the parasite you are

685
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:47,635
Wanna know a secret?

686
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:51,491
I will make sure

687
00:46:52,072 --> 00:46:55,874
You end up just like her

688
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:00,341
Run little bitch

689
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:01,366
Hi kids

690
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:04,184
Dean, what is this?

691
00:47:04,217 --> 00:47:05,560
I want you to know how hard its been

692
00:47:05,585 --> 00:47:08,717
This place, emm, they

693
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:11,860
It changes people

694
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:12,534
Every day

695
00:47:13,971 --> 00:47:16,399
Every single

696
00:47:16,424 --> 00:47:18,498
Pushes them to their most vulnerable

697
00:47:18,532 --> 00:47:19,580
Spence

698
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:21,486
Perform the ultimate sin

699
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:23,884
I hope you've grown up to be a better man than me

700
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:28,108
- Hes in his own personal hell
- And Sarah here, I

701
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:29,141
They all are

702
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:32,430
Turn it off

703
00:47:32,455 --> 00:47:34,257
I cant forgive you for killing her

704
00:47:34,282 --> 00:47:35,233
Turn it off

705
00:47:35,258 --> 00:47:36,640
It's already unplugged, Sarah

706
00:47:38,475 --> 00:47:39,533
What I've done

707
00:47:39,558 --> 00:47:40,741
Sarah

708
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:48,862
Come with me

709
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:50,963
I have a place

710
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:01,579
It was Autumn of 96

711
00:48:01,907 --> 00:48:03,610
Just before your parents got here

712
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:08,154
The inn, it was going under big time

713
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:12,519
The owner, and this was his whole life

714
00:48:12,552 --> 00:48:13,965
His entire existence

715
00:48:17,366 --> 00:48:20,201
One night
when all felt lost

716
00:48:21,061 --> 00:48:24,732
He tied a weight to his ankles
was about to jump into the pool

717
00:48:26,066 --> 00:48:28,103
When the bell at the reception desk rang,

718
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,139
Somebody needed a room

719
00:48:33,907 --> 00:48:36,610
Turns out he was a property developer

720
00:48:37,744 --> 00:48:39,642
And the two of them got to chatting

721
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:41,939
And struck up a deal

722
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:43,790
Reverse mortgage, if you will

723
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:46,353
A line of credit to keep the inn afloat

724
00:48:47,621 --> 00:48:49,909
Now for the owner, hes thinking like

725
00:48:50,049 --> 00:48:52,315
What a godsend, a miracle

726
00:48:52,525 --> 00:48:55,393
But there was a catch

727
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:56,695
What?

728
00:48:58,231 --> 00:48:59,231
Tell us

729
00:49:02,603 --> 00:49:04,838
He'd have to fill the hotel

730
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:06,550
Harvest 100 souls

731
00:49:06,575 --> 00:49:07,709
One in each room

732
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:08,929
I'm sorry, harvest?

733
00:49:08,954 --> 00:49:10,689
What the hell does that mean?

734
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:14,748
Your rooms last on the list

735
00:49:14,782 --> 00:49:16,117
The final vacancy

736
00:49:16,368 --> 00:49:17,860
Dude, who the hell are you?

737
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:18,885
Why are you here?

738
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:22,109
Its complicated

739
00:49:22,456 --> 00:49:23,720
So you are a ghost

740
00:49:24,385 --> 00:49:25,798
I knew it

741
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,088
No

742
00:49:29,752 --> 00:49:30,864
Prove it

743
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,584
Warm

744
00:49:41,022 --> 00:49:42,123
Tactile

745
00:49:43,756 --> 00:49:44,920
Thank you

746
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:50,178
So then why are you helping him?

747
00:49:50,713 --> 00:49:52,256
I signed a contract too,

748
00:49:53,586 --> 00:49:55,842
Kind of like the one you two signed

749
00:49:56,423 --> 00:49:57,858
- We didn't
- Wait

750
00:49:57,891 --> 00:49:59,493
Sarah, we signed the guest book

751
00:50:00,312 --> 00:50:01,350
Does that mean that We're?

752
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,729
Listen, the ink may be dry,

753
00:50:02,754 --> 00:50:04,344
But the nights not over yet

754
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:06,024
Destroy the book,

755
00:50:06,265 --> 00:50:07,844
- Maybe you have a chance
- Maybe?

756
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:09,125
Well nobody's ever done it before

757
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,438
You seem to know an awful lot about this

758
00:50:11,472 --> 00:50:13,740
How many people have you helped him kill?

759
00:50:13,773 --> 00:50:15,308
Look, I'm trying to help you here

760
00:50:15,342 --> 00:50:17,110
Do you have any idea what he would do to me

761
00:50:17,144 --> 00:50:18,266
If he knew I was talking right now?

762
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:21,720
That's probably not as bad as what hes going to do to us come what
sunrise

763
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:25,860
Its more like what you're going to do to yourself

764
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,598
Burn the book

765
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:47,549
Hello?

766
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,693
Mr Moss,

767
00:50:51,088 --> 00:50:53,190
I thought you'd
be asleep by now

768
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:55,021
What can I do for ya?

769
00:50:55,892 --> 00:50:57,230
Uh huh

770
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,581
Uh huh

771
00:50:58,606 --> 00:51:00,147
Yeah, yeah, we have extra towels

772
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:01,172
How many you need?

773
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:03,934
My, my, We're feeling luxurious tonight

774
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,200
Aren't we, Mr Moss?

775
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:07,394
Not a problem

776
00:51:07,427 --> 00:51:08,996
I'll bring them right over

777
00:51:09,028 --> 00:51:10,028
In a jiff

778
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,859
Mr Moss?

779
00:52:14,094 --> 00:52:15,444
Mr Moss!

780
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,563
Oh, shit

781
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:17,177
No

782
00:53:17,202 --> 00:53:18,491
No, no, no

783
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:19,774
No, no, no, no

784
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:21,937
Whats wrong?

785
00:53:23,377 --> 00:53:25,116
Shes in trouble

786
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:51,676
Poor kids

787
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:00,534
I'll be right there

788
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:28,028
My my

789
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:29,697
Gracious me

790
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:33,066
Ms Moss, what you
doing in the office?

791
00:54:39,155 --> 00:54:42,983
What are you doing with that?

792
00:54:50,044 --> 00:54:51,130
Answer me

793
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:53,146
Now!

794
00:54:55,255 --> 00:54:57,124
I

795
00:54:57,157 --> 00:54:59,360
That isn't yours

796
00:55:01,188 --> 00:55:05,422
Now why would you take something that doesn't belong to you?

797
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:09,532
I asked you a question

798
00:55:12,472 --> 00:55:15,166
I asked you a question

799
00:55:16,744 --> 00:55:18,009
You must understand

800
00:55:18,945 --> 00:55:23,077
The enormous value that book holds for me

801
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,429
So do you want it back?

802
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:30,289
I would

803
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:34,594
Good girl

804
00:55:36,697 --> 00:55:38,332
Good girl

805
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:40,867
Run!

806
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:43,804
I'm gonna get you

807
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:49,876
Get back here!

808
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:51,144
I need it back!

809
00:55:55,249 --> 00:55:56,484
What the fuck?

810
00:55:56,516 --> 00:55:57,917
Come on, come on, lets go, come on

811
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:58,753
Run!

812
00:55:58,786 --> 00:55:59,753
Lets go, come on

813
00:55:59,787 --> 00:56:01,172
You're gonna let him catch you

814
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:03,949
High step, high step, run

815
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:04,754
Go, go

816
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:05,722
Come on, please

817
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:06,861
We can do this

818
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:07,911
Hurry!

819
00:56:09,629 --> 00:56:10,563
Come on, come on

820
00:56:10,597 --> 00:56:11,665
Lets go, lets go

821
00:56:11,697 --> 00:56:12,726
Move, move

822
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:13,789
Ah, shit!

823
00:56:14,843 --> 00:56:16,425
- Did you get it?
- Spencer, what happened back there?

824
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,185
I Don't know, it was like I was there with you

825
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,017
- I could feel what you We're feeling
- Just do it, come on

826
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:20,758
Let me in

827
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:22,447
Let me in!

828
00:56:23,103 --> 00:56:26,092
- Wait, how do we know this is even gonna work?
- Of course it'll fucking work

829
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:28,045
How do you know? You've never done this before

830
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:30,063
- What if it, what if it like kills us or something?
- kills us?

831
00:56:30,088 --> 00:56:31,753
I Don't know, I'm not an expert in this scenario

832
00:56:31,778 --> 00:56:35,362
You're gonna be sorry!

833
00:56:37,236 --> 00:56:39,993
Okay, hes clearly got a hard-on for this thing, right?
What if we bargain with him?

834
00:56:40,018 --> 00:56:40,751
Right?

835
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:42,990
Give him the book back, have him take our names out
That might work, right?

836
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:43,826
Don't be stupid

837
00:56:43,851 --> 00:56:45,920
He will do anything to get it back
Just put the book in the fire!

838
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:48,151
I'll kill you

839
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:49,140
I'll kill you

840
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:50,193
No, I wont

841
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:51,957
I'll be your friend if you give me the book

842
00:56:52,294 --> 00:56:53,407
Spence

843
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,699
Wait, Spence

844
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,442
- We Don't have time
- What about dad?

845
00:56:57,467 --> 00:56:58,512
Sarah,

846
00:56:58,545 --> 00:56:59,447
Sarah, listen to me

847
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:02,623
Sarah, that wasn't him, okay

848
00:57:02,648 --> 00:57:03,949
It wasn't him

849
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:07,054
We have to do this

850
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:08,555
I'm gonna huff

851
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:09,791
I'm gonna puff

852
00:57:10,023 --> 00:57:12,927
And I'm gonna blow the door down

853
00:57:14,373 --> 00:57:15,833
Sarah, we've gotta

854
00:57:15,858 --> 00:57:16,943
Let's go

855
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:18,030
Come on

856
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:21,099
Lets go

857
00:57:21,834 --> 00:57:22,936
Come on

858
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,110
Okay, Sarah

859
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:36,625
Its gonna work, okay

860
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,853
Two
Three

861
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,530
No!

862
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:55,639
Why?

863
00:57:55,664 --> 00:57:57,922
My baby, why?

864
00:58:03,874 --> 00:58:05,287
What's so funny?

865
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:09,449
God, you're pathetic

866
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:13,420
I mean really pathetic

867
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:14,454
Please

868
00:58:14,487 --> 00:58:15,722
Please

869
00:58:15,755 --> 00:58:17,423
I did what you asked

870
00:58:17,571 --> 00:58:18,858
Almost

871
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:20,226
Almost?

872
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,328
Almost?

873
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,896
Not almost

874
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:24,030
all of it

875
00:58:24,063 --> 00:58:25,431
All of it!

876
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:28,049
I did it all, everything you asked for

877
00:58:28,074 --> 00:58:29,569
I did it

878
00:58:29,603 --> 00:58:31,204
Dean, whats he talking about?

879
00:58:32,972 --> 00:58:34,208
Arrangements like these

880
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,699
They just have very clear deliverables

881
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:37,167
Oh no, no, no

882
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:38,916
- No!
- Yes, yes

883
00:58:38,941 --> 00:58:40,540
Don't pull that crap with me

884
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:42,073
- No
- Yes

885
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:44,393
Yes, they do
And you knew that when you signed

886
00:58:44,418 --> 00:58:46,717
- Sarah, we gotta get out of here
- Sit

887
00:58:51,525 --> 00:58:52,525
Thank you

888
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:55,115
Where We're we?

889
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:55,981
Let me go

890
00:58:56,006 --> 00:58:56,894
- Yeah
- Let me go

891
00:58:56,919 --> 00:59:00,060
Yeah
Sorry, that part of the contract is now null and void

892
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:02,074
You promised me a ledger, baby

893
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:02,802
Oh, no, no, no

894
00:59:02,836 --> 00:59:03,879
You promised a ledger

895
00:59:03,904 --> 00:59:05,636
- Those We're not the rules, no
- Oh, great

896
00:59:05,661 --> 00:59:06,374
You know that

897
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:07,507
Now listen, those We're not the rules, no

898
00:59:07,532 --> 00:59:09,226
Let me rebuild it, this is what I can do

899
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:10,766
I have a great memory and you know that

900
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:11,852
I remember all the names

901
00:59:11,877 --> 00:59:12,938
Wow~~~

902
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:14,642
I know all the names and you know it

903
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:15,608
Come on, give em to me

904
00:59:15,633 --> 00:59:16,937
- Megan Franklin, Anita Sanchez
- Keep it go

905
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:18,669
- Keep it go
- William Sawyer, Bradford Lawson

906
00:59:18,694 --> 00:59:20,226
I remember them all, let me rebuild it and I guess

907
00:59:20,251 --> 00:59:21,905
It cant be in your hand, remember?

908
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,023
That is crap

909
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:23,864
That's nonsense

910
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:24,826
That's not the rules

911
00:59:24,851 --> 00:59:26,601
- Oh?
- No?

912
00:59:26,626 --> 00:59:29,074
No
No, no, no

913
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,606
You, you,

914
00:59:30,631 --> 00:59:32,349
You are making up new rules right now

915
00:59:33,849 --> 00:59:35,302
Fuck~

916
00:59:35,326 --> 00:59:37,004
No, fuck the book
You have to

917
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:38,379
Screw the book
You have

918
00:59:38,404 --> 00:59:39,449
You have to have the souls

919
00:59:39,474 --> 00:59:41,379
- The souls
- Yeah yeah yeah

920
00:59:41,404 --> 00:59:43,386
Are you
You're fucking me over

921
00:59:43,411 --> 00:59:45,214
You have to think about the administrative burden

922
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:47,581
Oh what crap is that?

923
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:49,871
You gotta think about the administrative burden

924
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:51,051
That's crap

925
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:53,019
What shit is that?

926
00:59:53,052 --> 00:59:54,434
I'm sorry

927
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:57,621
I am so, so, sorry

928
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:00,908
He really is

929
01:00:00,933 --> 01:00:03,447
The past couple of decades have been particularly rough

930
01:00:03,863 --> 01:00:05,953
But what a trooper hes been, huh?

931
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:12,373
I really did want you to have a memorable stay,

932
01:00:12,405 --> 01:00:15,236
all the amenities for your final night

933
01:00:23,365 --> 01:00:24,885
Why did you do this?

934
01:00:24,918 --> 01:00:26,061
What do you want?

935
01:00:29,537 --> 01:00:30,498
Everything

936
01:00:32,335 --> 01:00:34,795
Now listen to me, mister

937
01:00:34,827 --> 01:00:36,362
You said

938
01:00:36,396 --> 01:00:40,267
You said if I got you 100 souls

939
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,589
I could have mine back

940
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:44,284
Easy now

941
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,964
Give me my soul

942
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:50,730
Release me!

943
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:54,775
You know what

944
01:00:54,956 --> 01:00:56,940
You've always been more trouble

945
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:58,462
Oh

946
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,268
Than your worth

947
01:01:09,862 --> 01:01:12,065
Shit, that feels good

948
01:01:12,099 --> 01:01:14,169
Down, down, down he goes

949
01:01:15,856 --> 01:01:16,797
Fuck, it's hot in here

950
01:01:16,822 --> 01:01:17,890
God damn

951
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:37,293
Hi

952
01:01:38,604 --> 01:01:39,683
You're?

953
01:01:47,262 --> 01:01:49,019
Why couldn't you just do it yourself?

954
01:01:49,537 --> 01:01:51,284
There's a clause he requested

955
01:01:51,972 --> 01:01:52,906
He didn't trust me

956
01:01:52,938 --> 01:01:54,050
Can't Imagine why

957
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:58,304
But I'm a man that always abides by the terms of a contract

958
01:01:58,718 --> 01:02:00,802
So here's the deal

959
01:02:00,827 --> 01:02:01,827
No

960
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:03,382
No deal

961
01:02:04,249 --> 01:02:05,579
But you haven't even heard my proposition

962
01:02:05,604 --> 01:02:06,718
I don't need to

963
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:10,679
There's no escaping this

964
01:02:10,923 --> 01:02:12,525
You signed the book

965
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,113
You said we had until sunrise

966
01:02:14,138 --> 01:02:17,027
It's a little more complicated than that

967
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,832
Man, I'm just getting a little thirsty, huh?

968
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,596
Drink anybody?

969
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:25,416
No?
Right

970
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:26,299
Just me?
Come

971
01:02:31,577 --> 01:02:35,114
So you cant leave the hotel

972
01:02:35,148 --> 01:02:36,784
You already figured that out, right?

973
01:02:36,816 --> 01:02:38,026
Wander the property little bit

974
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,585
Explore the grounds

975
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:41,321
There's a stream up that hill

976
01:02:41,354 --> 01:02:43,290
In autumn, its fucking beautiful

977
01:02:46,592 --> 01:02:47,592
But

978
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:50,396
You cant escape the darkness

979
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:53,592
The shadows will follow you

980
01:02:55,182 --> 01:02:58,091
What you saw in the pool and your television

981
01:02:58,637 --> 01:03:01,746
Is nothing compared to what will come in the coming hours

982
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:04,210
Only they won't feel like hours

983
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:06,279
They'll feel like years

984
01:03:10,282 --> 01:03:12,375
You said you needed a hundred souls

985
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:15,818
Leave her and take mine

986
01:03:15,843 --> 01:03:16,828
My main man, Spence
Spence, no

987
01:03:16,828 --> 01:03:18,592
My main man, Spence

988
01:03:18,617 --> 01:03:19,939
That's what I'm talking about

989
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,425
I admire the nobility, but

990
01:03:21,777 --> 01:03:23,530
The unique circumstances of your birth

991
01:03:23,563 --> 01:03:25,265
Have provided me with a kind of,

992
01:03:25,298 --> 01:03:27,272
How do you say buy one, get one

993
01:03:27,297 --> 01:03:28,194
Please?

994
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:29,200
However

995
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,896
It seems as though

996
01:03:32,171 --> 01:03:34,420
We're up for new management here at the eagle inn

997
01:03:34,907 --> 01:03:37,210
Someone to replace this fucking guy, you know

998
01:03:39,112 --> 01:03:40,347
It's easy stuff

999
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,682
Check people in and trap their souls, no biggie

1000
01:03:42,715 --> 01:03:44,355
You think that's something you two could handle?

1001
01:03:44,674 --> 01:03:46,175
How can we trust you?

1002
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:48,027
We saw what you did to him

1003
01:03:48,554 --> 01:03:50,550
Okay, I like you guys

1004
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,761
I really do

1005
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:54,177
Strong cheekbones

1006
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,865
Strong-will

1007
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:57,449
Nothing like your father

1008
01:03:57,957 --> 01:04:00,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa

1009
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:01,686
Okay

1010
01:04:07,332 --> 01:04:08,858
Your mine now

1011
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,327
Remember that

1012
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:12,330
What if we say no?

1013
01:04:17,141 --> 01:04:18,543
Then I'll see you in hell

1014
01:04:21,086 --> 01:04:22,488
Why are you doing this?

1015
01:04:26,646 --> 01:04:27,622
Why?

1016
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,695
Why?

1017
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:34,778
Well, I've got a growing empire here

1018
01:04:36,403 --> 01:04:38,630
I need more aggregators, you know?

1019
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:41,848
Do you think this haunted hotel is the only one
I have in my portfolio?

1020
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:45,152
I have holdings in every state, every country

1021
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:46,506
All over the world

1022
01:04:47,713 --> 01:04:50,002
Your little friend, Maine
booked and busy

1023
01:04:50,027 --> 01:04:52,517
But Vermont, yeah
it's a little under par

1024
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:54,539
So what'd you say?

1025
01:04:54,564 --> 01:04:56,226
It might take you a while, but

1026
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,724
But a hundred souls

1027
01:04:57,757 --> 01:04:59,191
I'll give you yours back

1028
01:04:59,224 --> 01:05:01,345
200 souls, shit

1029
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,704
I'll even return the twin that I take

1030
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,859
Provided you can supply all the necessary deliverables

1031
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,139
I'll write something up

1032
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:14,561
But in the interim

1033
01:05:17,177 --> 01:05:18,577
Works just as good

1034
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:25,178
Who's it gonna be?

1035
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:36,503
Ooh

1036
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:49,941
Hello?

1037
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:05,416
Can I help you?

1038
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:06,692
Oh, hi

1039
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:08,718
I, I need a room

1040
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,101
Of course

1041
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:12,311
What brings you out this way?

1042
01:06:12,508 --> 01:06:13,826
Oh, en

1043
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:15,572
Sorry

1044
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,205
I'm just trying to get away from a few things for a while

1045
01:06:18,704 --> 01:06:19,908
Clear my head a bit

1046
01:06:21,212 --> 01:06:22,883
I've been driving all day

1047
01:06:22,908 --> 01:06:24,875
This morning I just got in the car and drove

1048
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,017
And here I am, I guess

1049
01:06:27,447 --> 01:06:29,484
Well, lucky for you we have a room available

1050
01:06:29,509 --> 01:06:30,690
Oh, great

1051
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,352
This should do it

1052
01:06:47,448 --> 01:06:48,867
Perfect

1053
01:06:48,892 --> 01:06:50,962
Ah, if you wouldn't mind

1054
01:06:51,595 --> 01:06:52,697
Almost forgot

1055
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:56,822
- Bit of an eagle inn tradition
- Sure, sure

1056
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:17,630
Care for a stroll
around the property?
