1
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,060
There was nothing special
about Somerset County.

2
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:17,771
It was a deeply ordinary place.

3
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,106
No astonishing thing
ever happened there.

4
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:25,145
The people who lived there
were just regular people.

5
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:29,410
And the animals...
Well, they were just plain old animals.

6
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:33,286
They didn't question the order of things.

7
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:38,156
So, the days passed,
one very much like the other.

8
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:43,624
But, one spring, on a small farm,

9
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,560
a little girl did something,

10
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:50,970
something that
would change everything.

11
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,503
What are you doing?

12
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,276
Fern, go back to bed.

13
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,346
You're not going to kill it, are you?

14
00:03:38,446 --> 00:03:40,471
It's a runt. Now, go back to bed.

15
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:44,314
No, it's not fair!
It can't help being born small.

16
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:45,386
Careful.

17
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,384
If I'd been born small,
would you have killed me?

18
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:49,817
Of course not.

19
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:54,761
A little girl is one thing.
A runty pig is another.

20
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,327
There's no difference!
This is unfair and unjust.

21
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,496
How could you be so heartless?

22
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:04,868
Come here.
I want to show you something.

23
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:07,134
You see that? You see?

24
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:10,537
There's 11 pigs and only 10 teats.

25
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,674
Sow can't feed it, honey.

26
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:15,514
Then I will.

27
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:26,387
I'll feed you and take care of you and...

28
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,931
...absolutely will not let you kill him.

29
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:51,117
- Hey! When did Fern get a pig?
- Avery, it's rude to point. Give me that.

30
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:54,484
Come, sit, eat your breakfast.
The bus will be here any minute.

31
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,284
Good morning.

32
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:58,656
Hey, Pop, can I have a pig, too?

33
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,228
No. I only give pigs to early risers.

34
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,824
Fern was up before dawn,
ridding the world of injustice.

35
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:09,563
Fern, put that pig down
and get to school.

36
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:10,797
Avery.

37
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,005
- See ya.
- Bye, Pop.

38
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,800
Have a good one, buddy.

39
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:19,439
Says here we're gonna get
a lot of rain this month.

40
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:28,015
Fern! Your books!

41
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,649
Bye.

42
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:35,689
Class, these are some of the questions

43
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:40,131
that you're likely to be asked
in the exam this week.

44
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,867
So, please take particular note
of every one.

45
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:51,139
You got to be quiet, okay?
You're gonna get me in trouble.

46
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:52,645
Drink that.

47
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,777
So, it's just a matter of
following these questions

48
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,855
and learning the answers.

49
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:06,284
Fern, what's going on?

50
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:07,955
Nothing.

51
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,761
Fern, what's in your desk?

52
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:14,562
- Nothing.
- Open it.

53
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:30,876
Thank you, Mrs. Arable.

54
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:34,144
Fern, you know better.

55
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:38,157
It's a pig, okay?
It's not a toy, not a doll, not a baby.

56
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,453
A pig.

57
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:42,419
And you need to start
treating it like one.

58
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:51,596
This is going too far.

59
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:01,413
I know she loves animals,
but you have to tell her.

60
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:04,212
- I know. She's just so happy with it.
- I know.

61
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,951
Doesrt that feel good?

62
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:18,191
Fern, I'm really sorry, honey,
but it's been long enough.

63
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,592
What?

64
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,396
Look, he's not a baby anymore.

65
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,734
I can't have you keeping what will soon
be a 300-pound pet around the house.

66
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,897
No.

67
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,908
Can't he stay in the barn? Please, Dad?

68
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:31,842
- No.
- Please?

69
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,005
No. Fern, look.
You know I've been selling the animals

70
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:36,276
to get the new harvesting equipment.

71
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,610
Pretty soon there's gonna be
no place in the barn for a pig.

72
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:42,153
I promised I'd take care of him.

73
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:44,691
Well, I'm letting you
out of your promise.

74
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:47,987
I didn't promise you. I promised Wilbur.

75
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,697
What about Homer?

76
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,900
He has animals.

77
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,032
Uncle Homer?

78
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:58,537
I'm sure he could make room for a pig.

79
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,603
Yeah.

80
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,814
He'd be right across the road.

81
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:26,322
Go to sleep, my little one

82
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:32,066
The sun has said goodbye for now

83
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:38,040
The moon shines on your beautiful face

84
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:44,409
My mom used to sing that to me
to make me feel safe.

85
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,114
Good night,

86
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:50,954
Wilbur.

87
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:03,568
Fern had walked across the road to her
uncle's barn hundreds of times before,

88
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:06,630
but it had never felt so far away.

89
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:10,109
It was just a big red barn
full of typical stuff.

90
00:09:14,849 --> 00:09:18,148
Come to think of it,
it couldn't have been more ordinary.

91
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:21,713
But sometimes,
when you take two ordinary things

92
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:24,314
and put them together
at just the right time,

93
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,753
there's a chance they'll become
two less ordinary things.

94
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:32,997
That runty pig, for instance,
and that big old smelly barn.

95
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:37,068
One sniff, and you knew it was a place
full of living things.

96
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,974
But that didn't necessarily mean
it was full of life.

97
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:42,474
It's okay. It's okay.

98
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:45,171
Nope. For that, this barn needed a pig.

99
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,645
This isn't so bad.

100
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:49,073
Only no one knew it yet.

101
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:50,514
Don't be afraid.

102
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,152
You'll be okay.

103
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:04,194
I'll come see you every day.

104
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,157
I'll be around so much
you'll be sick of me.

105
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,606
I love you.

106
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:29,989
Avery, the bus is here!

107
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:35,389
- Did you remember your sister's lunch?
- Got it!

108
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:03,781
What the hay?

109
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:06,689
- What's he doing?
- Probably-obably something smart.

110
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:09,285
- Pigs are smart.
- Pigs are not smart!

111
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:12,059
Apparently, they're as intelligent
as dolphins.

112
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,663
Advantage dolphin.

113
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:17,397
- He's going to knock himself out.
- Yeah! That's using your head!

114
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:19,837
How many times is he going to try that?

115
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,837
- Pig's out!
- I told you pigs are smart.

116
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,810
That's going to leave a mark.

117
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:29,850
- Oh, look, Bits. Pig's out.
- Sure is out.

118
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:31,145
Out of his mind!

119
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,858
Homer!

120
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,054
Lurvy!

121
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:42,593
- Pig's out!
- Pig's out, pig's out, pig's out!

122
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:45,632
- How about you walk a little faster?
- Wait your turn!

123
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,463
Wait! Wait! Fern, come back!

124
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:50,798
Just run!

125
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:54,397
Run, pig! Be free! I would if I could.

126
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:55,533
Retreat!

127
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:57,907
- Retreat!
- Don't retreat, pig! Giddyup!

128
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:00,810
- Oh, no! Not the smokehouse!
- No! Not the smokehouse!

129
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:07,081
- Is he looking?
- Yeah, he's seen it.

130
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:08,917
- Think he knows what it is?
- Of course not.

131
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:11,651
He's a spring pig.
He doesn't know anything.

132
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:16,462
Here, pig, pig, pig!

133
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,769
Don't fall for it. You're out.

134
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,195
And you're back in.

135
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:25,932
Here you go, piggy.

136
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:28,571
Attaboy. Eat it up.

137
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:32,772
Sold out for slop.
I'd have been to the county line by now.

138
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,905
He'd have made it
if you'd have just let me talk.

139
00:12:35,016 --> 00:12:37,484
- Made it to where? He's a pig!
- He's a pig.

140
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:42,012
Sorry I made such a fuss.
Your suggestions were really good,

141
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:45,854
but I think I'd better stay here.
Ferrs going to be back soon, anyway.

142
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,451
He's just stupid as a stick, poor thing.

143
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:50,656
- Should we speak to him?
- Certainly not!

144
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:51,789
Certainly not.

145
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,595
Sweetheart, it sounded-ounded
almost like you said

146
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:56,533
you'd run and be free if you could.

147
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:59,162
I meant if I were a pig.

148
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:01,400
You know what happens to pigs
around here.

149
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:04,808
Yes, I do.
And it should never, ever be spoken of.

150
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,187
I'm gonna miss you today.

151
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,493
See you when I get back, okay?

152
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:25,962
All right, I gotta go, okay? See you later.

153
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:34,742
Bye.

154
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:53,193
Goodbye, Fern. Hurry back.

155
00:13:57,698 --> 00:13:59,165
Hi.

156
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:00,632
My name's Wilbur.

157
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:02,962
Anyone want to play?

158
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:04,932
Anyone?

159
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:09,366
It's raining, you know.
And you know what you get with rain?

160
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:11,074
- Lightning.
- Typhoons.

161
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,476
- Cholera.
- Dysentery.

162
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,207
- Frizzy hair.
- That sad feeling.

163
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:15,612
No, mud!

164
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,775
What the heck is he doing now?

165
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,480
Hey, come on. You wanna join me?
Come on! Let's go!

166
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:22,146
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

167
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:25,384
Let's not.
How many times must I tell you?

168
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:29,259
Just because we're sheep,
it doesn't mean we have to follow.

169
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,122
Think for yourselves.

170
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,199
- Yourselves. Quite right!
- Look at me!

171
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,564
- No, no, no. Yourselves.
- Myself?

172
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:39,465
Hey, kid, this is a barn.
We don't play, we work.

173
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,542
- Some of us, anyway.
- "Some of us"?

174
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:44,611
Are you implying, lke,
that we don't work?

175
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:48,341
Because we work bloody hard,
thank you!

176
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:50,508
Hard? You grow hair!

177
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,683
"Grow hair." Good one!

178
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,445
Excuse me.

179
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:59,492
And is that your contribution to society,
you gassy rib eyes?

180
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:01,084
Filthy hairball!

181
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:03,356
- Rib eyes!
- Dirty lintball!

182
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:04,522
Zip it.

183
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:05,724
- They're at it again.
- Rib eyes! Rib eyes!

184
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,529
It's really slippery. That's the fun part!

185
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:11,503
Little itty-bitty pig,
could you come here, please?

186
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:15,333
You said your name is Wilbur, right?

187
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:17,206
That's right. What's your name?

188
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:18,835
- Gussy.
- Gussy?

189
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:21,176
- Great name!
- Thank you, Wilbur.

190
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:24,911
Now, you're so cute and pink,
but you're wasting your time.

191
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,247
These animals won't play.

192
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:28,015
- What about you?
- Me?

193
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:30,590
Well, I have to stay on my eggs.

194
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:32,784
Oh, wow! Look at that!

195
00:15:33,094 --> 00:15:35,460
Otherwise, of course, I'd love to play.

196
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,497
So, why can't you play?

197
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:41,193
Because what's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

198
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:43,998
What about the rest of you?
Don't any of you like to play?

199
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:46,073
Can't play on three empty stomachs.

200
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:50,735
Well, for us there's this whole
smell-of-wet-wool business. Ghastly!

201
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:54,042
See? I'm afraid
it's just not a play kind of place.

202
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:55,806
But you're all friends, right?

203
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:58,442
Sure. We've been here together
our whole lives.

204
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:02,716
I'm not so sure being in the same place
is the same as being friends.

205
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,887
I'm not hungry.
I just wanted someone to play with me.

206
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,630
What's that?

207
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:15,599
What is...

208
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:19,265
Could it be?

209
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:22,307
Slops!

210
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,676
Oh, joy. It seems the pig slop
has brought out the rodent.

211
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:28,772
Moldy cheese. Oh, yeah.

212
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:34,312
Did I have salami last night?

213
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:38,415
Yep. I guess I did.

214
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:41,256
- Oh, charming.
- Disgusting creature!

215
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:42,659
Hi, there.

216
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,597
Oh, you're a pig.

217
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,628
You're a pig.

218
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,628
Pig equals slop.

219
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:54,633
The rat is happy.

220
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,103
My name's Wilbur.

221
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,906
Do you have a name?
Or is it just "the rat"?

222
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:06,212
Did you say "just the rat"?

223
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:10,287
For your information, pig, the rat rules.

224
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:14,487
We were here long before your kind,
and we'll be here long after.

225
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:16,153
So, you just keep that in mind

226
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:19,596
next time you feel like
reducing me to "just the rat."

227
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,497
You called yourself "the rat."

228
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,602
I can call me that. You can't.

229
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:27,074
So you don't have a name?

230
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,910
Of course I do. It's Templeton.

231
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:33,043
Templeton? Great name!

232
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:36,344
- Oh, gee, thanks.
- Hey! You want to play, Templeton?

233
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,817
For so many reasons, no.

234
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,780
See, I don't play.

235
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:46,824
I gnaw, I spy, I eat, I hide.
Me in a nutshell.

236
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:48,758
Couldrt you just stay and chat?

237
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:50,831
Chat? Let me see.

238
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:54,226
Gnaw, spy, eat, hide.

239
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:56,735
Nope, "chat" ain't on the list.

240
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:06,313
The rat is handsome.

241
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,309
Tonight I dream of slop!

242
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:44,013
Fern, you are not going to see
that pig again. It's too late.

243
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:45,676
But he's expecting me!

244
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:49,118
And I'm expecting you to finish
your homework and go straight to bed.

245
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:51,748
But, Mom, I always tell him good night!

246
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,623
- Not tonight.
- He can't sleep if I don't.

247
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:58,793
Good night.

248
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,862
Good night.

249
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:03,696
Good night!

250
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:05,101
Good night.

251
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,805
Huh? Who said that?

252
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,577
Who are you?

253
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:13,579
Where are you? Are you invisible?

254
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,410
No, I'm nocturnal,

255
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:18,644
which means I work at night,
when you should be sleeping.

256
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,377
Now, I need to concentrate,
so, good night.

257
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:26,317
But I can't sleep now!
Please, tell me who you are.

258
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:29,022
I'm just really lonely.

259
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,795
So I've seen.

260
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:34,766
Look, you seem like a very nice pig,
so I'll tell you what.

261
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:37,703
If you go to sleep right now
and let me work,

262
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:39,705
we can converse tomorrow.

263
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:43,332
- Converse?
- I think your word was "chat."

264
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:45,978
Oh. Great! All right.

265
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,841
Good night. Good night. Good night.

266
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,481
Good night.

267
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:06,292
Okay, he still hasn't moved.

268
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,229
We've been here one, wait, two...

269
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:14,330
We've been here a long time, Elwyn,
and that guy ain't moving!

270
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:16,405
He's like a freak of nature.

271
00:20:16,977 --> 00:20:19,673
I'm dying, man.
I've got to get some corn!

272
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,112
I know, Brooksie. Just be patient.

273
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,613
Come on.

274
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,656
Come on.

275
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:32,819
Just a little further.

276
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:37,721
Okay, it's morning!

277
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:41,192
- Hey, Bits, I wasrt drooling, was I?
- Suck it up, Bets.

278
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:44,533
Would whoever addressed me last night
kindly make yourself known?

279
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:48,938
What luck! An early riser,
and he has things he needs to say.

280
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:50,943
Yeah, loud things.

281
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:53,911
I'm speaking to whoever spoke to me
last night.

282
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:55,845
I suppose that would be me.

283
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:57,441
Okay.

284
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:59,644
- I can't see you.
- Up here, in the corner.

285
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,355
The other corner.

286
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:07,693
I'm sorry. I still can't see you.

287
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:10,191
Move a little closer. I'll come down.

288
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,971
Hi. You're a...

289
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,411
Look, I've got a long day ahead of me
and I'm trying to get a little...

290
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:30,278
Spider! Spider! Get it away from me!

291
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:32,681
Get it away! Get it away!

292
00:21:33,353 --> 00:21:34,877
All right, keep your distance there.

293
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:38,822
- That thing is creepy.
- Golly! You're not being rude, are you?

294
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:43,157
No, no, no. I meant "creepy"
in a nice way. You know, creepy good.

295
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:44,355
Disgusting!

296
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:46,727
- They eat their menfolk, you know.
- I know!

297
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,030
Well? Still want to chat,
or are you gonna join them?

298
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:52,400
I've never met a spider before.

299
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,136
Did you make that?

300
00:21:55,341 --> 00:21:57,741
Is that what you were concentrating on
last night?

301
00:21:57,844 --> 00:22:00,472
- Yes.
- It's amazing.

302
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:03,872
Think you could teach me
how to make one of those?

303
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:09,382
Hold that thought, please.

304
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:14,555
- What are you doing?
- Making breakfast.

305
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:16,557
- Oh, boy.
- Relax.

306
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,163
First, I give him a little nip
to anesthetize him,

307
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:21,824
so he'll be more comfortable.

308
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:23,698
It's a little service I throw in.

309
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,532
Then I wrap him up.

310
00:22:25,772 --> 00:22:29,731
Then I just say grace because,
well, that's always nice,

311
00:22:29,843 --> 00:22:31,401
and he'll make a
perfectly delicious meal.

312
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:34,275
So, you eat flies?

313
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:36,071
No, no, no.

314
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:38,684
I drink their blood.

315
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:43,814
- Lying down on the job, eh?
- Fainted like a girl.

316
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:45,288
That's disgusting.

317
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:47,958
Well, that's easy for you to say.

318
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:51,155
You have all your meals
brought to you in a pail.

319
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:53,198
I don't get that kind of royal treatment.

320
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,732
I am a trapper.

321
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:58,634
I have to catch my food.
Which is why I make my home near you.

322
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:02,139
- Please don't hurt me.
- Well, since you said "please."

323
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:07,102
And just imagine how many bugs
there would be in this barn,

324
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:09,511
no, actually, in the world,

325
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:11,345
if spiders didn't catch them.

326
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,214
Insects would take over the planet!

327
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,844
The way I see it,
I'm doing everyone a favor.

328
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:17,680
Except for the fly.

329
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,387
Yes. Except for the fly.

330
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:29,229
I think now is the time
for me to say salutations.

331
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:30,929
What?

332
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:32,298
Salutations.

333
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,801
Okay. I'll leave.

334
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:37,342
No, Wilbur.

335
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:41,505
"Salutations" is just a fancy way
of saying hello.

336
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:43,749
Oh! Hello.

337
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:47,749
Hey, you know my name! What's yours?

338
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:49,482
My name?

339
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:53,088
My name is Charlotte.
Charlotte A. Cavatica.

340
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:56,087
Charlotte. Great name!

341
00:23:56,796 --> 00:23:59,128
Thank you. I've always thought so.

342
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,167
Hey, since you've said...

343
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:04,667
You know, that word,

344
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,636
does that mean we're friends?

345
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:09,702
I suppose it does.

346
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:11,276
Yeah!

347
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:17,274
Golly, go see what's going-oing on
over there.

348
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:21,410
What's going-oing...
Hey, kid, what's going on over here?

349
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:24,752
Oh, sorry.
I just made a new friend, that's all.

350
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:28,449
The spider. Oh, yeah. Good choice.

351
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,185
Yeah, perfect.

352
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:34,366
You picked someone
even more despised than me.

353
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,192
Why would anyone despise Charlotte?

354
00:24:37,503 --> 00:24:41,200
She made that amazing web,
and she keeps bugs out of the barn.

355
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:44,101
Look at her.
I mean, don't you think she's a little...

356
00:24:44,878 --> 00:24:46,675
What's the word?

357
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:50,946
I think she's beautiful.

358
00:24:52,452 --> 00:24:55,250
I beg your pardon. She is hideous!

359
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:58,290
Are we even seeing
the same ruddy creature?

360
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:00,355
I guess not.

361
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:05,590
Hopeless.

362
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:10,331
What a sorry little friendship
that's going to be.

363
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,468
There's an old expression that says
that ignorance is bliss,

364
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,208
and I'm inclined to believe it's true,

365
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:21,776
because, on that late spring day,

366
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,247
Wilbur was as happy as a pig could be.

367
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:28,314
And those spring days
rolled into summer days,

368
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:31,889
days filled with endless conversation

369
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,721
between the two unlikeliest of friends.

370
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:37,125
Charlotte, what's a spring pig?

371
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,130
A pig who was born in the spring.

372
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:41,632
Oh. And I thought it meant bouncy.

373
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,964
That would be a springy pig.

374
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:48,169
"After Mrs. Mallard had laid eight eggs
in the nest,

375
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:50,367
"she couldn't go to visit
Michael anymore,

376
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:53,138
"because she had to sit on the eggs
to keep them warm.

377
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:57,307
"She moved off the nest only to get
a drink of water, or to have her lunch,

378
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:00,511
"or to count the eggs
and make sure they were all there.

379
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,280
"One day, the ducklings hatched out.
First came Jack, then Kack..."

380
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:07,120
Yeah! Yeah! This is going to be great!

381
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:10,286
- Wilbur, what on earth are you doing?
- You'll see.

382
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:13,432
That feels marvelous!

383
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,058
Yes, over to the left a bit. Ah, yes.

384
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:19,935
Is that a breeze I feel?
I'm 10 pounds lighter!

385
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,131
- I'm next!
- I'm next!

386
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,798
- I'm next!
- I'm next, too!

387
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:25,537
- Looking pretty good, huh?
- Sure is.

388
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:29,303
Hi, there. Are you new to the barn?
I'm Wilbur.

389
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,007
Wilbur, it's me.

390
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:32,812
Me? Great name!

391
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:36,250
No, me. Me! Samuel! The sheep!

392
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:39,454
Wow! What happened to you?

393
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:47,800
The world's first pig web! Ta-da!

394
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:51,735
I think you'd better
leave the web-spinning to me.

395
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:53,635
After weeks and weeks,

396
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,541
and I'm talking about some long weeks
of waiting and expecting,

397
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:02,273
all the hard work has finally paid off.

398
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:06,316
Wow! Look at them! They were eggs,

399
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,546
and now they're... They're just...
Look at them!

400
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:11,446
Wow, Gussy,
you did a really terrific job!

401
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:13,525
They don't call me Mother Goose
for nothing.

402
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:14,923
Congratulations.

403
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,153
Would you look at that!

404
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:20,125
Yes, thank you, thank you!

405
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,133
It wasrt easy, but I managed.

406
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:23,702
You managed?

407
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:26,569
I'm kidding, honey. We managed.

408
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:30,872
Six, seven. Werert there eight eggs?

409
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:33,840
Could this be a dud?

410
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,777
Golly! Golly!

411
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:37,281
- Golly!
- Whoa!

412
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:40,910
Whoa, there, Father Goose!
I'm just trying to help the happy couple.

413
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,113
What do you want
with a rotten egg, anyway?

414
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:45,986
I want a rotten egg

415
00:27:46,092 --> 00:27:49,186
for the simple reason that...
You never know.

416
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:50,853
This one didn't make it.

417
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,828
I think we have to let it go.

418
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:55,834
Oh, take it!

419
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:59,029
And add it
to that nasty-asty collection of yours.

420
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,870
Last one out is a rotten egg!

421
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:05,904
- Well, I thought it was funny.
- I should have pecked him!

422
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:07,570
Don't you break that egg, rat.

423
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,342
A broken rotten egg would make
this barn stink to high heaven.

424
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,315
That would be a change.

425
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:15,652
Why are you laughing, Bits?
He just said we stink.

426
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:18,451
Oh, yeah. This is good.
This will come in handy.

427
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,790
You really are a handsome devil.

428
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,331
Oh, boy.

429
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,219
Egg-xactly!

430
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:04,365
Saw a big old spider in the doorway!
Gonna go catch it!

431
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,404
No, Avery! Come back here!

432
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:08,872
- Here, spidey-spidey.
- You can't do that!

433
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:11,969
Stop!

434
00:29:15,615 --> 00:29:17,549
- Gotcha!
- No, no, Avery!

435
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:21,284
Wilbur, no! Come on, Wilbur, get off!

436
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:24,419
Wilbur, Wilbur, why did you do that?

437
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:28,283
Avery! No!

438
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,901
That stinks!

439
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:41,974
Oh, that is gross.

440
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:48,811
Man, is that you?

441
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:51,907
No. I smell a smell, though.
Think it's scary guy?

442
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:54,714
- He's trying to stink us away from the...
- Corn!

443
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:01,690
Guess the yolk's on me.

444
00:30:02,962 --> 00:30:04,623
That is one ripe egg.

445
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:10,232
That stinks good!

446
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:12,128
That is disgusting!

447
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:17,374
- We told you not to break that egg.
- Now look what you've done, rat!

448
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:19,239
It saved Charlotte, didn't it?

449
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:22,837
Yeah, ingrates.
I saved the leggy lady's life.

450
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,010
- You mean that as a good thing, right?
- Of course.

451
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,018
I do have a few eyes, you know,

452
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,247
and I think
Wilbur did most of the saving.

453
00:30:30,356 --> 00:30:32,381
I know. Ironic, isn't it?

454
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:36,587
He's saving you,
and they're saving him for Christmas.

455
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:37,754
Templeton!

456
00:30:37,863 --> 00:30:39,194
What's Christmas?

457
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,859
The day you'll be cured.

458
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,534
But I'm not sick.

459
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:46,831
I didn't say you were sick.

460
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:50,102
- Uh-oh. That was a mistake.
- Yep. Typical rat.

461
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:54,236
What? You're going to lie
to the future football here? Okay.

462
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,580
But it's a sad statement when
I'm the most honest guy in the place.

463
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,015
Templeton, what are you talking about?

464
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,484
Come winter,
the farmer will be checking you

465
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:05,819
into the old smokehouse hotel.

466
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:11,888
And the only checking out that happens
is when people gather around and say,

467
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,665
"Check out that yummy sausage.

468
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:17,329
"Check out that sizzling bacon."

469
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,606
So, that's what that is for.

470
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,171
Ain't for roasting chestnuts.

471
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:31,605
He wouldn't. Humans love pigs.

472
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:34,782
Well, they love pork.

473
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:38,847
Well, this is awkward, isn't it?

474
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,655
Charlotte!

475
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,255
Charlotte, is it true?

476
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:47,128
Wilbur, few spring pigs get to see
the snows of winter.

477
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,997
No! I can't believe this. I won't believe it.

478
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:51,865
- Oh, Wilbur.
- It isn't fair!

479
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:55,901
- I want to live! I want to see the snow!
- And you will.

480
00:31:56,676 --> 00:32:00,737
I'm making you a promise right now.
I am not going to let them kill you.

481
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:03,642
You're a spider. You're little.
They're huge!

482
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:05,683
How are you going to stop them?

483
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:07,980
I have no idea. But it's a promise,

484
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:11,021
and promises are something
I never break.

485
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:13,788
Just don't you worry about it, Wilbur.

486
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:16,360
Besides, it's a long time
until Christmas.

487
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,559
Okay, Charlotte. If you say so.

488
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:33,544
- Dad?
- Yeah.

489
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:36,171
Can I walk home? I promised Wilbur
I'd be there right away.

490
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:38,079
- Sure. That's fine with me.
- Thanks.

491
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:39,446
Fern, wait!

492
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:44,553
Why don't you go to the Whites'
or the Sergeants' today and play?

493
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:46,955
- Or you could have someone over.
- Why?

494
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:49,793
Because you're spending too much time
in that barn.

495
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:52,090
It isn't good for you
to be alone so much.

496
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:55,366
Alone? All my best friends are there.

497
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:57,430
- Except the rat.
- The rat?

498
00:32:57,536 --> 00:33:00,004
I wouldn't call him my friend,
but the rest of them are.

499
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:02,267
They tell the greatest stories.
They make me laugh.

500
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,742
And I promised them I'd read 'em
this book, so I got to go. Bye!

501
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:10,481
Dr. Dorian, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

502
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,942
To think that animals can actually talk?

503
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:17,888
I don't know. Maybe an animal said
something to me and I didn't hear it

504
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,117
because I wasrt paying attention.

505
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:24,856
Maybe children are just better listeners
than we are.

506
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:28,562
Well, it worries me to no end.

507
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:33,294
What's got you worried is that her only
friends are pigs, sheep, geese and rats.

508
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:35,234
Well, not rats.

509
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:37,476
No.

510
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:39,672
- Does she look well?
- Yes.

511
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:41,542
Appetite's good?

512
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:44,038
- Does she sleep well at night?
- Yes.

513
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,118
I mean, she's right as rain in that way.

514
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:50,347
Well, there is a name for her condition.

515
00:33:51,624 --> 00:33:53,956
It's called a childhood phase.

516
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:58,587
And, sadly,
it's something she'll grow out of.

517
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:08,440
Charlotte, what are you doing?

518
00:34:08,874 --> 00:34:09,932
Thinking.

519
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:12,200
I do my best thinking upside down.

520
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,541
Blood goes to my head
and perks me up.

521
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:18,508
I've been thinking, too, you know,
about Christmas.

522
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:22,114
Don't worry, Wilbur.
We'll figure something out.

523
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:29,724
Come on, lke. Come on.

524
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:41,238
Not to be too much trouble,

525
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,900
but have you figured something out?

526
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:47,105
Not yet, but it's like a web.

527
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:51,741
You make it, you wait,
and something always comes.

528
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:53,584
Good night, Charlotte.

529
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:55,384
Good night, Wilbur.

530
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,086
And swing.

531
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,992
And stick.

532
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,164
And loop.

533
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:26,840
And back up, stick, and...

534
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:47,559
Mr. Zuckerman!

535
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:52,532
Okay, you gotta come see this.

536
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:02,046
Come on, Homer!

537
00:37:02,748 --> 00:37:03,840
Come on!

538
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:51,824
- What's a "so me pig"?
- It's "some pig."

539
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:54,296
It's a miracle.

540
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,267
It's nothing short of a bona fide miracle.

541
00:38:04,843 --> 00:38:06,242
Minister Beecher?

542
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:09,480
Homer. Edith.

543
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:11,611
What brings you here?

544
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:13,241
Divinity?

545
00:38:15,621 --> 00:38:16,986
We think so.

546
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:36,367
We'd better keep this quiet
until I address it in my sermon.

547
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:38,471
You can't tell a soul,
but you gotta come up to the barn.

548
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:39,544
Keep it between me and you.

549
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:42,078
- Swing by the farm.
- Okay. Goodbye.

550
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:52,584
Now, don't tell nobody.
Shouldrt get around.

551
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:57,660
There's a word in a spider web
at Zuckermars barn.

552
00:39:18,217 --> 00:39:22,153
Charlotte, what does a "some pig" do?

553
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:25,052
This isn't for what you do.
It's for what you are.

554
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:27,221
Some pigs might smile a bit.

555
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,568
The lifting of the head, nice touch!

556
00:39:58,323 --> 00:40:02,157
As ugly as that spider is,
we should have known she was smart.

557
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:05,230
So, you don't believe that someone
might be smart and pretty?

558
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,527
No. Yes! I mean, yes, because you are.

559
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:10,602
Clever little spider, isn't she?

560
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,761
Where's the spider who did this?

561
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:17,164
Well, we looked all over
and couldn't find one.

562
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:24,209
Looks pretty good.

563
00:40:24,316 --> 00:40:26,910
Still ain't gonna change anything.
He's a goner.

564
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:29,544
Yeah. Glad nobody eats cows.

565
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:34,115
- Got to admit, that's a fine-looking pig.
- Yep, that's some pig, all right.

566
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,967
After a few weeks,
the phenomenon of the web wore off.

567
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:48,529
Nobody cared anymore,

568
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:54,038
and what was amazing yesterday
was suddenly ordinary again today.

569
00:40:55,814 --> 00:40:58,783
It looked like
Wilbur might not see snow after all.

570
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:05,982
Excuse me, but why are we here?

571
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:09,527
I mean, yes, barn meeting and so on
and so forth. I understand that.

572
00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:14,156
But must this concern us?
And at such an ungodly hour!

573
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:16,029
You know, Wilbur's not the only one

574
00:41:16,134 --> 00:41:19,763
who could end up being Christmas
dinner with an apple in his mouth.

575
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:22,434
Good point. Yes. Carry on, then.

576
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:25,169
Ike, this involves every one of us.

577
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:29,509
I just have trouble looking at you.
That's all.

578
00:41:29,715 --> 00:41:31,683
This isn't about me. It's about Wilbur.

579
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:35,344
And, for the record, my view of you
is not exactly a treat, either.

580
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:40,019
As we have all seen,
humans have very short attention spans,

581
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,559
and there's just too much time
between now and Christmas.

582
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:45,425
Certainly enough time for
Zuckerman to find his affection for a pig

583
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,122
losing out to his hunger for ham.

584
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:49,200
- That spider can talk!
- Yeah.

585
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:51,101
What did she say, exactly?

586
00:41:51,203 --> 00:41:54,639
She said the farmer might possibly
still slaughter the pig.

587
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:58,834
Sorry, old chap,
but it is a common fate for your ilk.

588
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,535
I could just
bust through the fence again.

589
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:02,477
No. Once was enough for that.

590
00:42:02,581 --> 00:42:04,640
I just have to get the right word written.

591
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,843
Something that makes Wilbur
so special

592
00:42:06,952 --> 00:42:09,386
that Zuckerman will never
think about killing him again.

593
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:12,582
You need something snappy,
like "pig supreme."

594
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:14,090
That sounds like a dessert.

595
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:16,319
So, what's the point, anyway?
It won't work.

596
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:20,524
Could you please, just once,
say something-omething positive?

597
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:22,862
Okay. I'm positive it won't work.

598
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:26,269
How about
"harmoniously proportioned"?

599
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:30,068
- Harmoniously proportioned, yes!
- Stop that! You're following again.

600
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:33,667
Please, all of you!
What's the perfect word for Wilbur?

601
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:35,337
How about "delicious"?

602
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:38,775
Or "nutritious"? Or "extra crispy"?

603
00:42:39,251 --> 00:42:40,377
How about...

604
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:44,053
- Did you get him?
- Yep. Bull's-eye.

605
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:46,556
How about "terrific, terrific, terrific"?

606
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:49,957
Good. Much too long, though.
I've only got so much web.

607
00:42:50,062 --> 00:42:52,292
But one "terrific" might work.

608
00:42:52,397 --> 00:42:56,094
It simply isn't true.
The pig is not terrific.

609
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:59,364
Look at him! He's absolutely average.

610
00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:03,602
If you wish to be truthful,
then that is the word you should write.

611
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:04,937
"Average."

612
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,841
Wilbur, this only works
if the word I write is true.

613
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:11,882
And only you can tell us
which word that is.

614
00:43:11,984 --> 00:43:13,281
So look around.

615
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:16,817
We've all gathered around to help you.

616
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:19,421
Now tell everyone how you feel.

617
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:30,097
Look, there's a red one! And a blue one!

618
00:43:31,036 --> 00:43:33,163
Avery! You'll never catch me!

619
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:35,337
I'm going to get you!

620
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:39,439
Look at the fireworks, Mom!

621
00:43:40,312 --> 00:43:42,940
Avery, come on
if you ever want to catch me!

622
00:43:58,463 --> 00:44:00,397
This web thing is really paying off.

623
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:02,534
Mr. Zuckerman!

624
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:09,233
There it is, side to side,
right in the same place. "Terrific."

625
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:11,440
It was the most amazing thing!

626
00:44:11,543 --> 00:44:15,138
Last time we had hundreds of people.
This time it's going to be thousands!

627
00:44:15,247 --> 00:44:17,772
It says "terrific" just as clear as day.

628
00:44:17,883 --> 00:44:19,544
T-E-double-R-l-F-l-C.

629
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:22,085
I mean, can you imagine a spider
being able to spell that word?

630
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:24,451
I don't think I could spell that word
till the 10th grade.

631
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:38,361
- Fifty cents.
- Do you like that one, sir?

632
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,767
That's going to be $1.

633
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:43,102
- Wow!
- Gather 'round, folks!

634
00:44:44,242 --> 00:44:47,370
Remember, you saw it right here
at Zuckermars.

635
00:44:48,547 --> 00:44:52,176
And, before you leave, don't forget to
take some of our berries home with you!

636
00:44:52,284 --> 00:44:54,548
- So, you think this might work?
- Nope.

637
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:57,087
Dare I say it? He looks "terrific."

638
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:58,156
Look at them all!

639
00:44:58,256 --> 00:45:01,384
Yeah. Smile pretty.
I wish geese had teeth.

640
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:07,962
Been down here since dawn...

641
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,636
What are you suggesting? That Fern
has something to do with all this?

642
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,905
How else could those words
have gotten into that web?

643
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:18,643
I know everyone is saying
it's some kind of miracle, but...

644
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:21,439
But what? You don't think it is?

645
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,540
Do you?

646
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:27,244
The web itself is a miracle.

647
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:29,586
Wouldrt you agree?

648
00:45:30,956 --> 00:45:32,583
Well, can you spin one?

649
00:45:33,158 --> 00:45:36,616
- I can crochet a doily.
- Because someone taught you how.

650
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:40,429
Nobody teaches a spider.
They just know how to spin a web.

651
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,329
Don't you think that's a miracle?

652
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,576
As summer ended,
so did the excitement about the web.

653
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,843
Charlotte needed to
think of something special.

654
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,951
Special enough to change the way
people saw the world,

655
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:01,088
or at least one pig in the world, anyway.

656
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:06,561
The truth is, Charlotte feared she would
never find a word that could do all that.

657
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:11,060
And she had to hurry.
Time was running out for her.

658
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:15,737
But once a promise is made,
it needs to be kept.

659
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:19,370
- Still no web, huh?
- Nope.

660
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,540
I haven't seen one in, I'd say,
at least a month.

661
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:27,374
Funny how you get used to
all those people being around the place.

662
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:29,713
Kind of quiet without them, isn't it?

663
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,555
I noticed the hinge pirs busted
on the damper in the smokehouse.

664
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:37,216
Want me to order a new one?

665
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:39,995
Suppose you better.
That's a special order.

666
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,296
Better get a jump on that if we're going
to smoke any ham before the holidays.

667
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,630
We may need another
cord of wood, too.

668
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,930
I'm just going to throw this out here
one more time. "Pig supreme."

669
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,635
Oh, Golly!
Now you're just beating a dead horse.

670
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:56,405
- Hey!
- Sorry.

671
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:59,413
Look, I don't come across
many words in the field,

672
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:01,949
other than "Hyah!" or "Giddyup!"

673
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,187
But that rat's always dragging in trash
with writing on it.

674
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,346
I agree.

675
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,050
It's about time Templeton started
pulling his weight around here

676
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:10,648
instead of just eating it.

677
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,523
I bet he could bring us
some choice words.

678
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:16,622
I've got a choice word for you.
A little word called, "Uh-uh."

679
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:17,893
Well, that's two words.

680
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,869
And here's a few more.
Negative. No way. Nothing doing.

681
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:24,872
I ain't breaking my back
to try and save "some pig,"

682
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:28,239
no matter how "terrific"
you think the little lunch meat is.

683
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,782
You'll sing a different tune
when he's gone

684
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:40,117
and nobody brings around those
scrumptious buckets of slop.

685
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:43,457
And three, two...

686
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:45,186
Cue the rat!

687
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,160
Let's get one thing straight.

688
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,096
I don't care about the pig.

689
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:54,092
- What I care about is the slop.
- Of course.

690
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:58,196
And since I'll be at the dump anyway,
and it won't take any extra effort,

691
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,504
maybe, maybe I'll pick something up.

692
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:04,810
You're very kind.

693
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,480
Don't go spreading it around.

694
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:11,486
What? What do you want?

695
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,223
You'll need your strength.

696
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:26,394
Thanks.

697
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,602
But, Dad, I heard them.

698
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,403
I heard them talking
about the smokehouse!

699
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:35,067
He's not your pig anymore.

700
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,975
Well, I wouldn't have sold him
in the first place

701
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,411
if I knew this is what
they were gonna do to him.

702
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:41,039
That's what happens
to a pig on a farm, Fern.

703
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:43,916
You know that.

704
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:47,689
I'll see about that.

705
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:54,891
I've got maybe two, three years
before she can out-argue me.

706
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:56,662
Then I'm doomed.

707
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,931
And members of our own 4-H Club

708
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:03,199
will have the opportunity to enter
livestock and poultry in the competition.

709
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:05,968
So, in addition to the rides and games,

710
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:08,600
make sure you show them your support,
as well.

711
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:10,770
Any questions? Rita.

712
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,541
Miss Lewis, can I bring my chickens?

713
00:49:12,648 --> 00:49:16,049
Your chickens, I'm sure.
Pigs, chickens, horses and cows.

714
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,586
You certainly can,
and I hope you win first prize.

715
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:35,065
How can he be in every cornfield?

716
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,502
It can't be the same guy. It can't be!

717
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:39,573
He's wearing the same hat.

718
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:42,166
I'm telling you, he is following us!

719
00:49:42,278 --> 00:49:44,041
I hate that guy.

720
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,506
I have got to get some corn, Elwyn!

721
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,414
All right! All right! All right!
This is crazy.

722
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,510
- There's two of us, right?
- Yeah.

723
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:54,247
Trust me, there's two of us,
and there's only one of him.

724
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:57,053
I don't know, man. He scares me.
He really does.

725
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,720
- Just think about that corn. Corn.
- Yeah.

726
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:00,818
- The corn.
- Corn.

727
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,331
- All right, let's do it!
- Let's do it! Let's do it!

728
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:11,771
- Abort! Abort! Abort!
- Abort! Abort! Abort!

729
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,936
Man, he is good!
I bet he's laughing at us.

730
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:20,777
Don't look at him!
Don't even give him the satisfaction.

731
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:22,350
Just think about something else.

732
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,249
- Think about something else.
- Anything.

733
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:26,844
I think I see a rat.

734
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:29,618
- That's good.
- No, really, I see a rat.

735
00:50:29,725 --> 00:50:34,424
The rat is stealthy. The rat is nimble.
The rat is on the... whoa!

736
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:43,472
The rat is losing his touch.

737
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,904
- You want to go mess with him?
- Oh, yeah! I've got to peck something.

738
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,671
Rat on three.

739
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:51,940
One, two, three!

740
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:57,947
The rat has been spotted!

741
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:05,917
The rat is not

742
00:51:06,395 --> 00:51:07,953
enjoying this!

743
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,194
All this for slop?

744
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:19,172
The rat is desperate. The rat is trapped.

745
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:22,136
The rat needs to stop calling himself
"the rat."

746
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:25,975
"Find some words." Yeah, right,
the rat will never find words!

747
00:51:26,381 --> 00:51:28,178
Hey, look. Words.

748
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:33,544
- Hey, is he still in the can?
- He's in the can?

749
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:36,453
Maybe we should give him
some privacy. Always helps me out.

750
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:38,583
No, no, genius, not that can.

751
00:51:38,694 --> 00:51:40,753
Where did he go? I can't see him.

752
00:51:41,096 --> 00:51:43,030
All I see is that fruit moving.

753
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:45,656
- What fruit?
- The fruit with the tail!

754
00:51:46,034 --> 00:51:47,729
They'll never get me now.

755
00:51:48,036 --> 00:51:51,733
- Let's go get him!
- Go get him!

756
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,987
The rat rules!

757
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:14,825
- We're pink!
- Hey, what the... Pink?

758
00:52:14,963 --> 00:52:19,093
But that's all right, isn't it? I mean,
black pretty much goes with everything.

759
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:22,602
No, it's not all right.
That rat is going to pay!

760
00:52:26,908 --> 00:52:28,102
"Radiant."

761
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,075
- This might just work.
- Might?

762
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:32,646
Oh, for the love of Lucy!

763
00:52:34,616 --> 00:52:37,244
Here it comes. It did this yesterday.

764
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,511
Look that way, everyone!
Right towards that cloud!

765
00:52:40,622 --> 00:52:43,022
Good gracious.
Has it always done that?

766
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,615
No, it can't have.

767
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:48,184
- Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!
- Wow!

768
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,090
Oh, yes.

769
00:52:50,198 --> 00:52:52,393
This word will work quite nicely.

770
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:54,731
Then my work is done.

771
00:52:55,537 --> 00:52:57,562
And now for the fruits of my labor.

772
00:52:57,673 --> 00:53:00,403
And the vegetables! And the gravy!

773
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:27,268
All right, now.

774
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:31,932
"R."

775
00:53:35,177 --> 00:53:37,407
And stick.

776
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:45,283
And loop.

777
00:53:50,192 --> 00:53:51,216
And...

778
00:53:52,894 --> 00:53:55,055
Come on, Charlotte, you can do this.

779
00:53:56,765 --> 00:53:58,130
Don't slow down yet.

780
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:26,522
Welcome to Zuckermars!
Thank you all for coming.

781
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:29,490
Well, the web says it
better than I ever could.

782
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:33,927
That is some terrific, radiant pig!

783
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:40,364
And for that reason, I've decided
to enter Wilbur into the county fair.

784
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:48,046
Did you hear what they said, Charlotte?
I'm going to the fair!

785
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,610
Going to the fair!

786
00:54:49,718 --> 00:54:51,879
Wilbur might just see Christmas
after all.

787
00:54:51,987 --> 00:54:53,318
Is it good? Did we do it?

788
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:55,413
Yes, Wilbur. It's very good.

789
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:57,147
Now, smile.

790
00:54:57,259 --> 00:55:00,285
The fair, Homer?
What's gotten into you?

791
00:55:00,395 --> 00:55:02,158
I don't know, Sis. It just come to me.

792
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:04,789
He's a runt, Homer.
He doesn't stand a chance.

793
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,458
Well done! Never had a doubt!

794
00:55:06,568 --> 00:55:09,901
That spider did a heck of a job.
She's a hard worker.

795
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:12,872
Thank you, Charlotte.
You should take a little bow.

796
00:55:12,974 --> 00:55:15,033
And have my beauty steal the show?

797
00:55:15,143 --> 00:55:18,112
Now, go on and show them
what a radiant pig can do.

798
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,025
What do you mean
you're not going to the fair?

799
00:55:32,127 --> 00:55:35,358
I'm going to get a prize.
Don't you want to be there?

800
00:55:35,464 --> 00:55:37,864
Of course I do, Wilbur, very much.

801
00:55:37,966 --> 00:55:40,161
I'm just not up to traveling
at the moment.

802
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:43,726
- Why not?
- Because I'm expecting.

803
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:45,673
Expecting what?

804
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:47,374
"Expecting" means...

805
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,938
I'm expecting you to do fine without me.

806
00:55:51,112 --> 00:55:54,843
You're getting to be a big pig,
and you'll do just great on your own.

807
00:55:55,183 --> 00:55:56,878
Okay. I'll miss you.

808
00:56:05,093 --> 00:56:06,993
Come on, Homer, up and at 'em.

809
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:08,726
It's the big day.

810
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:14,601
- Fern?
- Mom!

811
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:17,638
I'm not wearing that.

812
00:56:24,746 --> 00:56:26,543
What the heck is she doing?

813
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:36,387
Bathed in buttermilk.

814
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:45,593
I've had this dream.

815
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:54,200
I've got to say he really is some pig.

816
00:56:54,576 --> 00:56:56,544
That's my buttermilk working.

817
00:56:56,845 --> 00:56:58,836
You sure you want to
go through with this, Homer?

818
00:56:58,947 --> 00:57:01,245
If you lose, you're out your entry fee.

819
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:02,646
He could win, though.

820
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:04,981
Stranger things
have been happening around here.

821
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:06,519
If he doesn't win, though?

822
00:57:06,621 --> 00:57:09,249
Well, the way I figure it,
even if he does lose,

823
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:11,791
I can make it all back
on the bacon alone.

824
00:57:14,896 --> 00:57:16,591
Wilbur! Wilbur!

825
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:18,054
Do something, Homer.

826
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,157
- What happened?
- I don't know. He just fainted.

827
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:22,034
It's all right, hon.

828
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:23,627
- Lurvy, get some water!
- It's okay, Wilbur.

829
00:57:23,738 --> 00:57:26,969
Charlotte, are you feeling-eeling okay?

830
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:31,803
Why is it so hard for that farmer to see
what is right in front of his face?

831
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,381
Look what Wilbur has done
for this farm. Isn't that better than ham?

832
00:57:35,483 --> 00:57:38,077
Well, there's only one thing to do,
and I have to be there to do it.

833
00:57:38,186 --> 00:57:41,155
Charlotte, you have your babies
to think about now.

834
00:57:41,256 --> 00:57:44,248
Yes, I know.
But I made a promise to my friend.

835
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,824
A big blue ribbon ought to finally get
the point through that farmer's head.

836
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:50,397
- Easy, Lurvy. Easy.
- Coming through! Coming through!

837
00:57:50,498 --> 00:57:51,760
Here we go!

838
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:55,260
- There we go.
- He's up.

839
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:57,361
Okay, let's see if he'll get in the crate.

840
00:57:57,472 --> 00:57:59,599
- Buttermilk.
- Templeton?

841
00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:03,310
I need you to go with me.
We'll have to find another word,

842
00:58:03,411 --> 00:58:04,969
a really good one.

843
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,206
Sorry, lady.

844
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:09,845
Comes a time when the rat's got to ask
himself, "What's in it for the rat?"

845
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:12,283
- He's right. We've been to the fair.
- We have?

846
00:58:12,387 --> 00:58:15,015
Remember? All that garbage there?

847
00:58:15,123 --> 00:58:18,559
Oh, yeah! It's littered with hunks
of chewed-on funnel cakes...

848
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,649
How's that?

849
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:22,821
And dribs of ice cream
going sour in the sun.

850
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:27,529
And spitty little cotton candy bits
ground into the mud.

851
00:58:27,636 --> 00:58:30,127
Popcorn, moldy cheese,
half-eaten sandwiches

852
00:58:30,238 --> 00:58:32,263
and sticky-icky-icky candy apples.

853
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:35,138
Wait!
Go back to the moldy cheese thing.

854
00:58:35,243 --> 00:58:37,268
I've never seen
so much disgusting trash!

855
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:39,244
Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

856
00:58:39,347 --> 00:58:40,644
Don't hurt him, Dad!

857
00:58:40,749 --> 00:58:43,809
Nearly made me gag, the stink of it,
especially that deviled egg.

858
00:58:43,918 --> 00:58:45,112
You better hurry up, rat.
They're gonna leave you!

859
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,187
Wait for me!

860
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:47,777
- Nice and easy.
- Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

861
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:50,858
More food than you'll see in a lifetime!

862
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,550
- Bye, Aunt Edith!
- Bye.

863
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:56,426
Bye, Fern! Bye, Avery!
See you at the fair, guys!

864
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:58,565
Hey, it worked!

865
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:01,961
I think we milked it a little there
at the end, though.

866
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:04,595
All right. All right, John,
I'll see you over there!

867
00:59:04,706 --> 00:59:06,765
Charlotte, you're coming with me!

868
00:59:07,008 --> 00:59:08,873
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

869
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:10,569
Thank you for coming.

870
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,479
- Good luck, Wilbur! Win that ribbon!
- Go get 'em, Wilbur!

871
00:59:16,484 --> 00:59:17,951
We're going to the fair!

872
00:59:23,558 --> 00:59:26,220
Going to the fair! Going to the fair!

873
00:59:26,327 --> 00:59:28,295
- I'm going on the bumper cars.
- So fun!

874
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,679
The sign looks good, Homer.
Nice and even.

875
00:59:44,979 --> 00:59:46,844
All right, there we go.

876
00:59:50,285 --> 00:59:51,912
There you go, Wilbur.

877
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:56,181
Okay, where's the filth?

878
00:59:56,891 --> 00:59:59,291
Have you heard that good things come
to those who wait?

879
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:03,160
No, good things come to those
who find it and shove it in their mouth.

880
01:00:09,871 --> 01:00:11,771
Don't think I don't know, Fern,

881
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:16,108
that we're all here
because a determined little girl

882
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:17,972
made a promise to a pig.

883
01:00:19,848 --> 01:00:21,440
- Wilbur.
- Sorry.

884
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,550
I mean Wilbur.

885
01:00:26,187 --> 01:00:27,848
I'm proud of you, honey.

886
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,057
Thanks.

887
01:00:35,497 --> 01:00:37,260
Fern? Avery?

888
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:44,166
I'm going to give you each 10 tickets
to do as you like out there.

889
01:00:44,272 --> 01:00:45,637
And you have to make them last all day,

890
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,605
so don't go spending them all at once.
Okay?

891
01:00:47,709 --> 01:00:48,937
- Wow!
- All right!

892
01:00:50,245 --> 01:00:52,372
- I'll be right back. Okay.
- Come on!

893
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,948
You're going to win the prize tomorrow.
I know it.

894
01:00:55,049 --> 01:00:57,040
- Everything will be all right.
- Fern, let's go!

895
01:00:57,152 --> 01:00:58,119
Okay.

896
01:01:03,424 --> 01:01:04,721
Oh, my.

897
01:01:05,326 --> 01:01:07,226
Is that what we're up against?

898
01:01:16,504 --> 01:01:19,234
Excuse me. What is your name?

899
01:01:22,043 --> 01:01:24,705
When someone wants to get
your attention,

900
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:26,940
what is it they call out?

901
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:28,441
Uncle.

902
01:01:29,517 --> 01:01:32,315
Tell me, Uncle,
what is the date of your birth?

903
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:36,886
Your birthday?

904
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:43,824
For heavers sake, all I want to know
is if you're a spring pig.

905
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:48,329
Of course. What did you think I was?
A spring chicken?

906
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:53,732
Huge and humorous. Arert we talented!

907
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:56,101
Spring chicken.

908
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:05,742
Charlotte, who are you talking to?

909
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:09,153
- The pig next door.
- Should I be worried?

910
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:11,989
Of course not.
What good would that do?

911
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,523
Whoa!
Have you seen the beast next door?

912
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:18,098
I think his mama was part hippo.

913
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:20,497
If I had to name five of the fattest pigs
I've ever seen,

914
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:23,162
he'd be three of them. He's a shoo-in.

915
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:26,434
Please. That pig is not nearly
as handsome as Wilbur,

916
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:29,209
or as harmoniously proportioned,

917
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,938
- and not nearly as clean.
- There's a real tiebreaker.

918
01:02:32,046 --> 01:02:36,073
We just have to prove that the finest pig
is not necessarily the fattest.

919
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:39,080
And you can do your part, Wilbur,
by getting some rest.

920
01:02:39,187 --> 01:02:41,678
- I'm not tired, Charlotte.
- Okay.

921
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,157
Well, could you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

922
01:02:47,095 --> 01:02:50,792
All right, Templeton, you're right.
That pig over there is a shoo-in.

923
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:53,993
So, I need words that are even better
than that pig is fat.

924
01:02:54,102 --> 01:02:56,195
Special words, and lots of them.

925
01:02:56,304 --> 01:02:58,499
How about "pushy" and "demanding"?

926
01:02:58,606 --> 01:03:00,096
Templeton, please!

927
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:02,699
This is our last chance
to save Wilbur's life.

928
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,370
You do realize
I'm just here for the food, right?

929
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,777
Of course.

930
01:03:22,797 --> 01:03:24,230
Enjoy the ride.

931
01:03:25,266 --> 01:03:26,460
One, please.

932
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,531
Must be in the other pocket. Sorry.

933
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:30,228
- One second.
- All right.

934
01:03:34,676 --> 01:03:35,973
Two, please.

935
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,225
Is that Fern up there?

936
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:04,937
Well, I'll be.

937
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,872
- She's with a boy.
- She is! She's with a boy!

938
01:04:11,012 --> 01:04:12,070
Oh, no.

939
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:15,181
She's with a boy.

940
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:18,579
Manna from heaven!

941
01:04:25,293 --> 01:04:27,921
I don't know what this is, but I love it!

942
01:04:43,511 --> 01:04:45,103
One-stop slopping.

943
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:52,412
All right.
Let's go get the spider off my back.

944
01:04:53,554 --> 01:04:55,545
How come I'm not in a cornfield, Elwyn?
How come?

945
01:04:55,656 --> 01:04:59,057
Hey, hey.
They got all kinds of corn right here.

946
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,857
You got your popcorn,
caramel corn, candy corn.

947
01:05:02,964 --> 01:05:04,295
Stop torturing me!

948
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:08,028
I'm starving here, and now I'm
cross-eyed because of this pink stuff.

949
01:05:08,136 --> 01:05:10,104
If I ever see that rat again...

950
01:05:10,438 --> 01:05:13,066
Words, words, words.

951
01:05:13,808 --> 01:05:15,571
"Pork rinds."

952
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:17,567
That'll draw a crowd.

953
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:22,477
This looks promising.

954
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:28,748
Hey! That rat!

955
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:31,551
I'm going to get me some rat!

956
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:33,917
Oh, not these birdbrains.

957
01:05:34,028 --> 01:05:35,689
Let's get rid of them once and for all.

958
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:38,994
...and everything. Rat on three! Three!

959
01:05:39,967 --> 01:05:42,435
Wait up, Brooksie! I'm coming with you!

960
01:05:46,741 --> 01:05:48,572
Little flamingoes!

961
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:51,442
Come and get me!

962
01:05:52,346 --> 01:05:56,214
- It's scary guy!
- Abort! Abort!

963
01:05:57,785 --> 01:05:59,412
Peck him! Peck him, Elwyn!

964
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:05,952
Wait a minute. His eyes are buttons,
and his hair is straw.

965
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,084
This guy ain't real!

966
01:06:07,195 --> 01:06:08,389
- He's not?
- No!

967
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:11,932
Oh, yeah! The rat rules! Take that!

968
01:06:12,033 --> 01:06:13,364
Do you know what this means?

969
01:06:13,468 --> 01:06:14,560
- Yeah.
- What?

970
01:06:14,669 --> 01:06:16,796
We could've had corn!

971
01:06:20,074 --> 01:06:21,974
Well, Your Highness,
you satisfied or what?

972
01:06:22,076 --> 01:06:24,408
'Cause I've got a spitty hunk of
pineapple upside-down cake out there

973
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:25,604
with my name on it.

974
01:06:25,713 --> 01:06:27,510
Yes, very satisfied.

975
01:06:28,082 --> 01:06:31,848
Be careful. If you keep this up,
someone might think you care.

976
01:06:32,186 --> 01:06:33,915
Gee, I'm all choked up.

977
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:36,948
Charlotte?

978
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:40,690
If I don't win the prize tomorrow, they're
gonna send me to the smokehouse.

979
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:42,422
You're going to win, Wilbur.

980
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:44,760
And you're going to see
the snows of winter.

981
01:06:44,866 --> 01:06:47,562
I told you, I never break a promise.

982
01:07:05,953 --> 01:07:07,284
Mom?

983
01:07:07,688 --> 01:07:09,553
Will you put these in for me?

984
01:07:12,927 --> 01:07:14,724
You look like a girl!

985
01:07:15,396 --> 01:07:17,091
And I still hit like one.

986
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,635
Well, what do you think?

987
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,798
It's a great word. It's just...

988
01:07:26,941 --> 01:07:28,067
Just what?

989
01:07:28,209 --> 01:07:31,007
Is it the right word? Is it true?

990
01:07:31,479 --> 01:07:32,810
Because I don't really feel like

991
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:35,849
I deserve any of the things
you've written about me.

992
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:39,953
Then it is the perfect word.

993
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:45,990
The web!

994
01:07:48,996 --> 01:07:50,463
Hey, Wilbur!

995
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,294
"Humble."

996
01:07:57,405 --> 01:07:58,838
Hey, Wilbur.

997
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,534
If that's not a prize-winner,
I don't know what is.

998
01:08:01,642 --> 01:08:03,405
He's going to win this thing, isn't he?

999
01:08:03,511 --> 01:08:06,537
Oh, Homer, I can't go up to that
grandstand looking like this.

1000
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:16,513
Homer.

1001
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,723
It's not fair.

1002
01:08:31,372 --> 01:08:34,364
Why didn't they tell us
the judging was going to be so early?

1003
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:37,477
We did our best.

1004
01:08:41,682 --> 01:08:44,310
I'll get the truck and take him home.

1005
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:46,920
I really thought we had a shot.

1006
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:56,360
It's okay. It'll be okay.

1007
01:08:59,867 --> 01:09:02,461
I told you. There it is! The web!

1008
01:09:03,704 --> 01:09:05,137
Mom...

1009
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:09,206
What's going on?

1010
01:09:18,352 --> 01:09:21,583
It looks like it's "humble."

1011
01:09:33,534 --> 01:09:36,731
Excuse me. Thank you.
Coming through. Excuse me.

1012
01:09:37,571 --> 01:09:40,506
Mr. Zuckerman!
Could you come with me, please?

1013
01:09:41,142 --> 01:09:43,337
Oh, and bring the pig, too.

1014
01:09:45,313 --> 01:09:46,280
Homer.

1015
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:20,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of the state of Maine,

1016
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:23,248
it gives us great pleasure to present

1017
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:26,184
Zuckermars famous pig!

1018
01:10:31,859 --> 01:10:33,554
Folks! Folks!

1019
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:36,762
I think we all remember
the start of summer,

1020
01:10:36,864 --> 01:10:41,164
when the writing appeared on the web
in Mr. Zuckermars barn.

1021
01:10:41,535 --> 01:10:44,561
And now it has happened yet again!

1022
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:47,834
Which is why the governors of the fair

1023
01:10:47,942 --> 01:10:49,739
are honored to present

1024
01:10:51,045 --> 01:10:53,013
this handsome medal.

1025
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:57,574
A token of our amazement
and our appreciation.

1026
01:11:06,327 --> 01:11:07,760
I love you, Wilbur.

1027
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,561
Well, what can I say about this pig
that hasn't already been said?

1028
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:21,006
I know a lot of you folks
have come out to the farm,

1029
01:11:21,108 --> 01:11:22,973
and you've seen the words.

1030
01:11:23,077 --> 01:11:26,774
A lot of you have asked me,
"How could this have happened?"

1031
01:11:27,882 --> 01:11:29,281
I don't know.

1032
01:11:29,683 --> 01:11:31,082
But it has happened

1033
01:11:32,453 --> 01:11:36,787
in a time when we really don't see
many miraculous things.

1034
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:39,288
Or maybe we do.

1035
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:43,556
Maybe they're all right there around us,
every day,

1036
01:11:44,298 --> 01:11:46,528
and we just don't know where to look.

1037
01:11:48,803 --> 01:11:52,432
There's no denying
that our own little Wilbur,

1038
01:11:53,207 --> 01:11:56,301
he's part of something
that's bigger than all of us.

1039
01:12:00,414 --> 01:12:02,314
And life on that farm

1040
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:05,818
is just a whole lot better with him in it.

1041
01:12:06,954 --> 01:12:09,821
He really is some pig.

1042
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:11,916
Way to go, Wilbur!

1043
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:33,070
Charlotte, look how happy she is!

1044
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,943
Isn't that great?

1045
01:12:35,049 --> 01:12:36,949
Yes, it's wonderful.

1046
01:12:37,751 --> 01:12:39,218
Hey, what's that?

1047
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:42,719
This is my magnum opus.

1048
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:44,680
What's a magnet opus?

1049
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:48,052
Magnum opus.

1050
01:12:48,562 --> 01:12:52,498
It means "great work."
It's a nutrient-filled, waterproof egg sac.

1051
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,968
Really? There's eggs in there?

1052
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:58,436
My babies, 514 of them.

1053
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:02,635
Wow! With 514 baby spiders
all over the place,

1054
01:13:02,743 --> 01:13:05,075
it's going to be really radiant
in the barn!

1055
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:09,513
Wilbur, I'm afraid they're not going to
make it back to the barn.

1056
01:13:09,617 --> 01:13:10,584
What?

1057
01:13:10,718 --> 01:13:12,242
What are you talking about?

1058
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,651
You're not going to
leave them here alone, are you?

1059
01:13:14,755 --> 01:13:17,349
I have no choice. I'm languishing.

1060
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,425
What does that mean?

1061
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:21,327
It means I'm dying.

1062
01:13:21,795 --> 01:13:22,955
What?

1063
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:24,998
You can't die!

1064
01:13:25,165 --> 01:13:28,532
Wilbur, we're born, we live,

1065
01:13:28,636 --> 01:13:30,831
and, when our time comes, we die.

1066
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:33,602
It's just the natural cycle of life.

1067
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:36,468
No! No, just climb down.

1068
01:13:36,577 --> 01:13:38,807
I'll carry you the rest of the way.

1069
01:13:39,246 --> 01:13:42,443
We'll go back to the barn,
and I'll take care of you.

1070
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:43,949
No, Wilbur.

1071
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:46,576
I don't even have the strength
to climb down.

1072
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:48,115
You have to.

1073
01:13:48,789 --> 01:13:50,552
You've done so much for me!

1074
01:13:50,891 --> 01:13:53,121
And it was my great pleasure.

1075
01:13:53,561 --> 01:13:55,620
Please come down, Charlotte.

1076
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:58,197
Please. There must be
something I can do.

1077
01:13:58,299 --> 01:13:59,425
No, Wilbur.

1078
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:01,797
Don't you know
what you've already done?

1079
01:14:01,902 --> 01:14:03,563
You made me your friend,

1080
01:14:03,771 --> 01:14:07,867
and, in doing so, you made a spider
beautiful to everyone in that barn.

1081
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:13,174
I didn't do anything, Charlotte.
You did it all.

1082
01:14:13,647 --> 01:14:17,174
No. My webs were no miracle, Wilbur.

1083
01:14:17,551 --> 01:14:19,917
I was only describing what I saw.

1084
01:14:20,654 --> 01:14:23,350
The miracle is you.

1085
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:44,040
Templeton!

1086
01:14:44,545 --> 01:14:46,172
Charlotte is very sick.

1087
01:14:46,447 --> 01:14:48,244
Yeah, and twisted.

1088
01:14:48,782 --> 01:14:51,649
She's dying! She can't go home with us.

1089
01:14:51,752 --> 01:14:54,084
So, I need you to help me
take her egg sac with us.

1090
01:14:54,188 --> 01:14:55,416
Did you say eggs?

1091
01:14:55,522 --> 01:14:57,752
It's an egg sac. And it's right up there,

1092
01:14:57,858 --> 01:14:59,485
and it has her children in it.

1093
01:14:59,593 --> 01:15:02,824
And I can't just leave it here.
What if something happened to them?

1094
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:05,797
Now, I can't reach it,
so I need you to get it for me.

1095
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:07,628
And I need you to do it now.

1096
01:15:07,735 --> 01:15:09,202
I don't think I like your tone.

1097
01:15:09,303 --> 01:15:13,034
Can't you just once in your life think
of someone other than yourself?

1098
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,631
- A little further. Keep coming.
- Once? Once?

1099
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,302
Come on.

1100
01:15:17,411 --> 01:15:18,708
No, you come on!

1101
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:22,039
Who got his hindquarters pecked
to make you "radiant," huh?

1102
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:23,616
Templeton, that's who.

1103
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:27,551
And who interrupted the gorging
of a lifetime so you could be "humble"?

1104
01:15:27,655 --> 01:15:30,317
Why, I think it was Templeton!

1105
01:15:30,424 --> 01:15:33,916
Templeton! Templeton! Templeton!

1106
01:15:34,028 --> 01:15:35,655
And do I get thanked?

1107
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:38,422
No!

1108
01:15:38,532 --> 01:15:40,261
Well, has it ever occurred to you

1109
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:44,130
that even a rat
might like a little appreciation?

1110
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:47,264
A little, dare I say, love?

1111
01:15:47,374 --> 01:15:50,104
Do it and you'll get dibs on my slop
for the rest of my life.

1112
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,268
Done.

1113
01:15:51,412 --> 01:15:53,744
Hurry! Up in the corner on the ledge.

1114
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:08,623
Templeton!

1115
01:16:14,768 --> 01:16:15,894
Come on!

1116
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:26,669
Thank you, Templeton,

1117
01:16:28,348 --> 01:16:29,975
for everything.

1118
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,287
It's okay, just drop it. Hurry!

1119
01:16:46,633 --> 01:16:48,601
Here you go. Here's your medal.

1120
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:51,327
- In you go.
- Time to go home, Wilbur.

1121
01:16:51,638 --> 01:16:54,072
All right. Close her up, Lurvy.

1122
01:16:56,009 --> 01:16:57,636
Okay, easy now.

1123
01:17:11,325 --> 01:17:12,622
Goodbye,

1124
01:17:13,527 --> 01:17:15,552
my sweet, sweet Wilbur.

1125
01:17:18,999 --> 01:17:20,523
Goodbye, Charlotte.

1126
01:17:21,235 --> 01:17:22,793
I love you.

1127
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:12,746
Is that our lovely-ovely-ovely
little Wilbur?

1128
01:18:12,853 --> 01:18:15,413
- And he's got a medal!
- Strong work, kid.

1129
01:18:15,522 --> 01:18:16,887
He looks so grown up.

1130
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:19,550
- I always knew he could do it.
- Never had a doubt.

1131
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,218
Welcome home, Wilbur.

1132
01:18:23,797 --> 01:18:25,025
Wilbur?

1133
01:18:25,532 --> 01:18:26,897
Where's Charlotte?

1134
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,695
I got a bad feeling, Bits.

1135
01:18:29,169 --> 01:18:30,636
Me, too.

1136
01:19:28,395 --> 01:19:31,523
Now, that isn't to say
Charlotte was gone forever.

1137
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:34,425
She lived on
in the hearts of those that knew her,

1138
01:19:34,534 --> 01:19:36,900
and even those that didn't.

1139
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:40,400
Something had changed
in Somerset County.

1140
01:19:41,475 --> 01:19:44,967
It was as if people knew
they lived in a special place now.

1141
01:19:45,979 --> 01:19:49,676
And, in small ways,
they started being special people,

1142
01:19:50,584 --> 01:19:52,051
a little bit kinder,

1143
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:54,778
a bit more understanding.

1144
01:19:55,822 --> 01:19:58,188
And the animals felt different, too.

1145
01:19:58,659 --> 01:19:59,853
Closer.

1146
01:20:00,994 --> 01:20:04,953
The warmth of their friendship carried
them through the long, cold months.

1147
01:20:05,999 --> 01:20:08,593
They showed it
in little gestures of kindness,

1148
01:20:09,069 --> 01:20:10,400
unusual patience,

1149
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:12,838
and promises kept.

1150
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:19,104
Even the hardest of hearts found
themselves rising to the occasion.

1151
01:20:27,487 --> 01:20:30,854
And, finally, the greatest promise of all,

1152
01:20:31,725 --> 01:20:35,286
a spring pig saw his first snowfall.

1153
01:20:36,997 --> 01:20:40,489
It was as though Charlotte herself
had shaken it out of the sky.

1154
01:21:12,232 --> 01:21:16,498
The stillness of winter continued
to the first thaw, like it always does.

1155
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:20,604
And then, the first buds of spring.

1156
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:26,846
And, before you knew it,
life had come full circle.

1157
01:21:42,295 --> 01:21:44,263
They're here! They're here!

1158
01:21:44,364 --> 01:21:46,127
They're here, everybody!

1159
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,833
Hey, there. I'm Wilbur.
I'm a friend of your mom's.

1160
01:21:50,203 --> 01:21:52,831
Boy, are we glad to see you!

1161
01:21:57,344 --> 01:21:58,743
So creepy!

1162
01:21:58,845 --> 01:22:00,870
And cute! Just like their mother.

1163
01:22:00,981 --> 01:22:03,415
They're so, so beautiful.

1164
01:22:04,918 --> 01:22:07,785
I just want to scoop them up
and hug them all.

1165
01:22:08,155 --> 01:22:10,350
Wow, you can fly!

1166
01:22:10,724 --> 01:22:12,521
Look at you go!

1167
01:22:24,905 --> 01:22:28,534
Now that is something to follow.

1168
01:22:32,646 --> 01:22:36,207
Go, little spiders! Be free! I wish I could.

1169
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:40,141
I'm kidding, honey.
I think I got one inside my beak.

1170
01:22:41,354 --> 01:22:44,619
- Thanks, baby.
- That's my Golly-olly-olly.

1171
01:22:44,724 --> 01:22:45,986
Wow!

1172
01:22:46,593 --> 01:22:48,185
I can't believe they're really here.

1173
01:22:48,295 --> 01:22:51,492
- So pretty.
- Yeah, Bits.

1174
01:22:52,532 --> 01:22:54,397
You doing okay over there, lke?

1175
01:22:54,501 --> 01:22:57,299
I'm okay with it. I'm okay with it, Bets.

1176
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:59,129
I'm okay with it.

1177
01:23:00,073 --> 01:23:03,008
Spiders are nice. Spiders are my friend.

1178
01:23:03,944 --> 01:23:06,003
Spiders won't hurt me.

1179
01:23:13,987 --> 01:23:17,855
Wait! What's happening?
What are you doing?

1180
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:19,789
- Bye!
- Bye!

1181
01:23:19,993 --> 01:23:21,517
Please don't go.

1182
01:23:21,862 --> 01:23:23,727
- Goodbye! Bye!
- Wait! Wait!

1183
01:23:25,899 --> 01:23:27,196
Goodbye!

1184
01:23:28,902 --> 01:23:30,460
Where are you going?

1185
01:23:30,837 --> 01:23:32,134
We're setting forth.

1186
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,936
We take to the breeze.
We go as we please.

1187
01:23:36,376 --> 01:23:38,071
We take to the breeze!

1188
01:23:38,311 --> 01:23:39,369
Bye!

1189
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:41,208
But you can't go!

1190
01:23:41,882 --> 01:23:44,077
I had so much I wanted to tell you!

1191
01:23:45,919 --> 01:23:48,319
And someone I wanted to tell you about.

1192
01:23:55,962 --> 01:23:57,429
Salutations!

1193
01:23:58,732 --> 01:24:00,529
- Who said that?
- I'm up here.

1194
01:24:00,767 --> 01:24:02,735
- So am I.
- Me, too.

1195
01:24:02,836 --> 01:24:06,033
- We'd like to stay.
- We like it here.

1196
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,505
And we like you, too.

1197
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:13,238
You're staying? Oh, that's great!
That's really, really great!

1198
01:24:13,613 --> 01:24:16,377
Three friends! What are your names?

1199
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:20,083
I'll tell you my name if you'll tell me
why you're trembling.

1200
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,811
Well, I think I'm trembling with joy.

1201
01:24:22,923 --> 01:24:25,983
- Then my name is Joy.
- Joy? Perfect.

1202
01:24:26,092 --> 01:24:28,890
- What was my mom's middle initial?
- A.

1203
01:24:28,995 --> 01:24:31,589
Then my name is Aranea.

1204
01:24:31,698 --> 01:24:33,495
Wow! Great name!

1205
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,564
Why don't you pick my name for me?

1206
01:24:35,669 --> 01:24:39,070
Something sensible.
Not too long, not too fancy.

1207
01:24:39,873 --> 01:24:41,704
And not too dumb.

1208
01:24:41,808 --> 01:24:43,901
Tricky. How about

1209
01:24:45,312 --> 01:24:46,301
Nellie?

1210
01:24:46,413 --> 01:24:49,473
Nellie? I like it. Well done!

1211
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:52,145
Joy, Aranea, Nellie,

1212
01:24:52,552 --> 01:24:56,886
you have chosen a hallowed doorway
in which to spin your webs.

1213
01:24:57,424 --> 01:24:59,449
This was your mother's doorway.

1214
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:02,653
She was loyal, brilliant, beautiful,

1215
01:25:02,762 --> 01:25:04,389
and she was my friend.

1216
01:25:04,497 --> 01:25:07,057
I will treasure her memory forever.

1217
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:11,564
So, to you, her daughters,
I pledge my friendship.

1218
01:25:12,072 --> 01:25:13,437
I pledge mine!

1219
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,667
- I do, too!
- So do I!

1220
01:25:25,685 --> 01:25:28,711
Okay, I'd like to make
a couple of announcements.

1221
01:25:29,089 --> 01:25:30,113
First of all,

1222
01:25:30,223 --> 01:25:32,191
if you gals are word-lovers,

1223
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:34,886
and you need
a few scraps of paper for inspiration,

1224
01:25:35,328 --> 01:25:37,125
don't look at me.

1225
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:40,297
My word-fetching days are over.

1226
01:25:40,667 --> 01:25:44,763
I'm not the rat I used to be.
I'm at least twice that.

1227
01:25:45,805 --> 01:25:48,706
So, if you need something to write,
try this,

1228
01:25:49,075 --> 01:25:51,737
"Some rat." Some rat.

1229
01:25:52,178 --> 01:25:53,270
Think about it.

1230
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:56,543
Slops! Oh, yeah!

1231
01:26:01,187 --> 01:26:03,121
And, in an ordinary barn,

1232
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:07,590
an ordinary pig, a runt no less,

1233
01:26:08,628 --> 01:26:10,528
stood surrounded by friends,

1234
01:26:12,332 --> 01:26:14,960
welcoming his second spring.

1235
01:26:16,503 --> 01:26:19,734
And that spring was followed by many,
many more.

1236
01:26:21,308 --> 01:26:23,868
All because someone stopped to see
the grace

1237
01:26:24,377 --> 01:26:28,404
and beauty and nobility
of the humblest creature.

1238
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:33,219
That is the miracle of friendship.

1239
01:26:34,921 --> 01:26:36,684
It is not often
that someone comes along

1240
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:39,486
who is a true friend and a good writer.

1241
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:43,052
Charlotte was both.
