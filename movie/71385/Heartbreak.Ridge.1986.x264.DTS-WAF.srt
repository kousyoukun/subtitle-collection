1
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:55,259
- Here's that four-ten.
- Right.

2
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:07,438
I been pumping pussy
since Christ was a corporal.

3
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,235
<i>I can tell you, the best damned poontang
I ever paid for was in Da Nang.</i>

4
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,446
The girls were checked out daily.

5
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:19,575
<i>And we got ourselves laid in a safe,
orderly, proficient, military manner.</i>

6
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:23,579
That is until some suckhead
writes home to mama...

7
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:27,041
...and says he dipped his wick
in the Republic of South Vietnam.

8
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,586
Then the shit hits the fan.

9
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,382
<i>A committee of congressmen who,
asshole-to-asshole...</i>

10
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:36,884
...couldn't make a beer fart
in a whirlwind...

11
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:41,139
<i>...start telling your basic ass-in-the-grass
Marine, "No more shore time."</i>

12
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,934
We respond in true Marine Corps fashion.

13
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:49,397
<i>We salute, do an about face, double-time
back to the boom-boom garbage dump...</i>

14
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:53,735
<i>...where we get the clap,
and the drip, and the crabs...</i>

15
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:58,489
...and a generally poor attitude
towards the female of the species.

16
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:01,826
<i>War is hell, boy. That's a fact.</i>

17
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,121
I don't like soldier boys.

18
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,250
Say what?

19
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:14,172
<i>You want to pop that puppy's can, you
don't have to grease him so hard, jarhead.</i>

20
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,969
Sounds like you're a man of experience.

21
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:22,597
<i>What the fuck's that mean, grunt-shit?</i>

22
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:27,018
<i>It means be advised
that I'm mean, nasty and tired.</i>

23
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:29,479
I eat concertina wire and piss napalm...

24
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:33,107
...and I can put a round through a flea's ass
at two hundred meters.

25
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:37,278
<i>So go hump somebody else's leg,
mutt face, before I push yours in.</i>

26
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:41,783
<i>You aren't going to be so smart with
your balls stuffed in your mouth, jarhead.</i>

27
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,704
<i>Hang onto this, boy.</i>

28
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,499
I think war's just been declared.

29
00:05:57,048 --> 00:06:00,510
Just sit there and bleed for a while
before you taste some real pain.

30
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,518
Maybe first I carve me some faggot wings.

31
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:11,646
Kill him.

32
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:35,586
<i>Then again,
there was this dusky gal in Bangkok...</i>

33
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,214
<i>...a real crossway breezer, I swear.</i>

34
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:42,969
<i>Thank you for your testimony,
Officer Reese.</i>

35
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:50,184
Sergeant Highway.

36
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,937
Drunk and disorderly...

37
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:55,690
...fighting in a public establishment...

38
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,402
...urinating on a police vehicle.

39
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:08,161
<i>It seemed like the thing to do, sir.</i>

40
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:14,375
Just because there's no war going on...

41
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,004
...it doesn't give you the right
to start one every time you get drunk.

42
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:23,426
I'm taking into account
your excellent military record...

43
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,637
...and your commitment
to the security of this great nation...

44
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,934
...but this is your last chance.

45
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,023
$100 fine. Next.

46
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:48,910
<i>Your nightstick file for divorce, Reese?</i>

47
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,832
<i>Who do you think you are,
pissing on my squad car?</i>

48
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,794
You think you can break our rules
and just walk away?

49
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,964
We're supposed to wet our pants over
your goddamned colored ribbons?

50
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,300
<i>Read that file of yours sometime, hero.</i>

51
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,053
Check the dates.
It's ancient fucking history.

52
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:10,223
One night you're going to be
puking blood in some alley...

53
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:13,017
...and you'll see me standing there.
Then we'll see.

54
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,435
<i>Keep dreaming, shitball.</i>

55
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,605
You'll pay full price.
I don't give any serviceman's discount.

56
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,690
Too bad. Your old lady does.

57
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,413
Just about cleaned you out.

58
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,043
<i>Sure makes you feel good, doesn't it?
Helping Uncle Sam battle dirty drawers?</i>

59
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:44,048
<i>Just pump the neighbor's dog, Jake?
Or are you always that slack-eyed and silly?</i>

60
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:46,592
<i>Looks like you need a lift, Highway.</i>

61
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:51,806
<i>Suck on one of these, smooth as a prom
queen's thighs only not quite so risky.</i>

62
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:55,476
Havana cured.
Got a pal over in Guantanamo in Supply.

63
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:57,311
We do each other favors.

64
00:08:57,562 --> 00:09:01,149
<i>I've got lots of friends. Of course,
I could always use another friend.</i>

65
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:04,318
<i>- So we can do each other favors?
- Yes, sure.</i>

66
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:09,991
<i>If your pencil wasn't quite so sharp, and
your eyesight not so clear around here...</i>

67
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:15,288
...I could make your military life a lot
comfier and more rewarding.

68
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,834
<i>Sergeant, you get that contraband stogie
out of my face...</i>

69
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:24,464
<i>...before I shove it so far up your ass, you'll
have to set fire to your nose to light it.</i>

70
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,175
<i>Gunney Highway,
Major Devin wants to see you, ASAP.</i>

71
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:36,559
<i>- At ease. That'll be all, Sergeant Major.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

72
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,104
<i>Highway, relax.</i>

73
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:42,356
Stop being so gung-ho.

74
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,358
<i>That's what I am, sir.</i>

75
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:49,197
<i>What do you got now, about 24?</i>

76
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,115
<i>And then some, sir.</i>

77
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:55,536
Some men in your position
would look forward to retirement.

78
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:59,373
Take their wives on
an around-the-world cruise.

79
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,542
But that's not your way. Is it?

80
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:06,714
You choose to harangue my staff
with a request for transfer to...

81
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:09,258
...a Fleet Marine Force Unit.

82
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,765
<i>The very unit you got busted out of for
insubordination, conduct unbecoming.</i>

83
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,645
<i>That's true, Major. I have had
my differences with some limp dicks...</i>

84
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,105
Highway!

85
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:26,234
I don't know whether to admire you...

86
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,861
...or resent the living hell out of you.

87
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:33,241
<i>Either way, I guess it doesn't matter.
You're out of here, effective immediately.</i>

88
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,202
<i>Where to, sir?</i>

89
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:41,999
<i>2nd Recon Battalion, 2nd Marine Division.
You're going home.</i>

90
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:45,753
<i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

91
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,467
Gunney Highway?

92
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:53,886
Sir?

93
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,348
Be careful what you wish for.
You might just get it.

94
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:03,479
Halt!

95
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,524
About face!

96
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,044
<i>We're going to bring up
tonight's last victim.</i>

97
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:29,088
<i>He's a true blood, born in New Jersey.</i>

98
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:31,132
<i>He's the President of Punk.</i>

99
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,009
<i>The Earl of Funk.</i>

100
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:37,430
<i>The next king of rock and roll himself.
Ladies and gentlemen, Stitch Jones.</i>

101
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:56,157
<i>Do I bother you while you're
playing romance the sheep?</i>

102
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,952
<i>Why not bag the geeks
and keep America beautiful?</i>

103
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:02,747
<i>Put a 10-gallon bag
over their 10-gallon heads.</i>

104
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,332
Shall we take care of this?

105
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,002
You look like
the Twin Towers turned to cellulite.

106
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:12,340
I can play country-western.
Give me another chance.

107
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:13,466
Oh yeah?

108
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,053
<i>I know Merle Haggard, Hoss Cartwright,
The Beverly Hillbillies.</i>

109
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:19,514
Give me another chance.
I need the money!

110
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,019
- How far?
- About two stops.

111
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,893
- Are you the maid?
- No.

112
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:49,562
<i>I want the seat,
but it's not worth dying over.</i>

113
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:56,069
<i>Liz and Dick, Lennon and McCartney,
even Ali and Frazier...</i>

114
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,613
<i>...they worked it out. So can we, right?</i>

115
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:01,657
Stitch Jones is the name.
Rocking and rapping is the game.

116
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,701
<i>Pleased to meet you, too.</i>

117
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,871
<i>I banged up my Corvette,
but I figure, what the hell...</i>

118
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:09,999
...gives me a chance to get out
and meet the regular people.

119
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,919
People like yourself. People like my fans.

120
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,129
I'm a singer. You heard of me.

121
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:19,133
<i>Stitch Jones: Earl of Funk, Duke of Cool,
Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.</i>

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,885
<i>Shut your face, hippie.</i>

123
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,471
Did you say "hippie"?

124
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:27,016
Haven't been hippies
around here for centuries.

125
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,352
You been freeze-dried or doing hard time?

126
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,400
One of those would sure go down nice.

127

<i>I'd buy one from you,

Usually I get one of my lackeys
to do my business.

129
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:44,575
You can have one for free
if it will shut that hole under your nose.

130
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:45,952
<i>Thank you, my man.</i>

131

132
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:54,961
This doesn't mean you can blow in my ear.

133
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:57,755
These aren't your magazines.

<i>You want to talk tonight, I'll listen.</i>

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,821
Don't try to sell me on making love or
making music because I'm an authority.

152
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:07,408
Born to screw and bred to sing. That's me.

153
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,577
I must cut a few Z's myself.

154
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:13,081
So keep down the chatter
while I get my beauty sleep.

155
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,221
Yes. Groupies are fun
but you need your vitamins...

156
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:30,264
...because those babes'll wear you out.

157
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,725
<i>- Anything else, General?
- No. That's fine.</i>

158
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,437
What are all those medals?

159
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:40,274
<i>I'll never tell.
At least, not while the sun is shining.</i>

160
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:46,656
This babe is whacked.

161
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,951
She doesn't know what's
twelve inches long and white.

162
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:51,285
Nothing.

163
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,082
No offense. Just working on my routine.

164
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:59,419
<i>I'll tell you what's black and bleeding,
if it don't shut up.</i>

165
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:02,505
<i>Mellow, man. It's gonna be a nice day.</i>

166
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:08,136
<i>Tell the driver, I'll be right out.</i>

167
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:11,681
Don't worry. I'll use my plastic.
It's my treat for your hospitality.

168
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,975
<i>Thanks, I'll get the tip.</i>

169
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,653
My buddy will take care of that.

170
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:29,490
He asked me to tell you that
there's no sunshine in the men's john.

171
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:44,922
<i>I'm here, baby. Let's do some distance.</i>

172
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,352
Son of a bitch.

173
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:43,981
You're going to slurp my lifer's juice
out of my own cup?

174
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,653
Yes. I guess I should have
gotten shots beforehand.

175
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:53,658
<i>If your brain was as quick as your mouth,
you'd be a twenty-star general by now.</i>

176
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:57,286
<i>If I was half as ugly as you,
Sergeant Major...</i>

177
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:59,747
...I'd be a poster boy for a prophylactic.

178
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,500
Still a mean and nasty bastard.

179
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,797
<i>Goddamn! It's sure good to see you, Tom,
back where you belong.</i>

180
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,425
Take it easy.
Everybody will think I'm spoken for.

181
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:14,595
<i>'Morning, sir.</i>

182
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,556
Sergeant Major?

183
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:18,433
<i>Coffee, sir?</i>

184
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:21,144
Negative.

185
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,439
<i>Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway,
reporting for duty, sir.</i>

186
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:32,905
<i>That Operation Officer's farthole is sewed
so tight, he shits out of his mouth.</i>

187
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:34,157
Academy?

188
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,492
Big-time football hero.

189
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:39,287
When am I ever going to get a break?

190
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,663
Never.

191
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:43,040
- Sergeant Major?
- Sir!

192
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,042
Bring in Gunnery Sergeant Highway.

193
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,724
Been in a long time.

194
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,560
<i>I've felt a little heat, sir.</i>

195
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:06,814
Korea. Dominican in 1965.
Three tours of duty in Vietnam.

196
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:10,109
This old bulldog is carrying
so much shrapnel...

197
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:12,779
...he can't pass through
an airport metal detector.

198
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:16,491
I haven't yet had the privilege of combat.

199
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,497
I recently came over
from Supply and Logistics.

200
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,500
<i>An unappreciated field of endeavor, sir.</i>

201
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,127
Quite.

202
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:31,923
My record of achievement thus far
has been exemplary...

203
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,051
...and I fully intend for that to continue.

204
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:36,427
Sir.

205
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:40,515
I want this battalion to be
the class of the division.

206
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:44,143
I expect my noncommissioned officers
to lead by example.

207
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,855
Public fighting and insubordination
to civilian authority...

208
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:50,108
...are not what I call "good standards."

209
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,693
<i>It was a minor altercation, sir.</i>

210
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:54,654
<i>You make a habit of that, Gunney.</i>

211
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,490
A year ago you hit an officer.

212
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,826
I went to Annapolis with that man.

213
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:02,078
<i>You try that with me, Sergeant Highway...</i>

214
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:05,998
<i>...and you'll drag your butt in a sling
for a month, understand?</i>

215
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,126
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

216
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:14,173
<i>I don't know what strings you pulled to
get here, but I assure you, I don't like it.</i>

217
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,342
This is the new Marine Corps.

218
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,512
The new breed.

219
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:22,557
Characters like you are an anachronism.

220
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:28,354
<i>You should be sealed in a case that reads,
"Break Glass Only in the Event of War."</i>

221
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:35,987
I have no tolerance for you old-timers
who think you know better. Understand?

222
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:42,076
<i>I understand a lot of body bags get
filled if I don't do my job, sir.</i>

223
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,162
Major!

224
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,958
Division has assigned Gunney Highway
to our Reconnaissance Platoon.

225
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:55,923
<i>Yes, Recon.</i>

226
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,678
<i>Their last sergeant was
an old-time combat vet, too.</i>

227
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,556
But he went ROAD on me...

228
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:06,267
..."Retired On Active Duty."

229
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,145
<i>Had a few months to retirement,
figured he'd coast.</i>

230
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,065
Allowed the men to lapse into mediocrity.

231
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,071
<i>You're close to mandatory retirement
yourself. Aren't you, Highway?</i>

232
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,907
<i>That's right, Major.</i>

233
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:27,622
<i>I ask for Marines,
the division sends me relics.</i>

234
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:37,882
<i>The men in Recon Platoon are less than
highly motivated, to say the least.</i>

235
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:40,259
I want those men in shape.

236
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:44,764
<i>I'll make life-takers
and heartbreakers out of them, sir.</i>

237
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,102
Dismissed.

238
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:57,568
<i>Is he always like that,
or is he trying to make a good impression?</i>

239
00:22:57,652 --> 00:23:01,197
He even consults the Marine Corps manual
before he mounts his old lady...

240
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,826
<i>...just to insure he performs in an orderly,
proficient, military manner.</i>

241
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:07,829
Chow with Helen and me tonight.
She can't wait to see you.

242
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:10,957
<i>Later, we can stomp some brain cells
and tell some stories.</i>

243
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,961
<i>- I'd like to, but I'd better get organized.
- Sure. I understand.</i>

244
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,631
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

245
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:22,176
<i>I mean, Gunney. Sergeant Major.</i>

246
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:26,264
<i>Sir, this is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.
He's been assigned to Recon Platoon.</i>

247
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:28,015
Outstanding! Welcome aboard.

248
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,729
I have to hightail it.
I'm late for pre-scuba school.

249
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:37,150
His mama know he's playing Marine?

250
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,737
<i>By the way, he's Lieutenant Ring.
Your platoon leader.</i>

251
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:42,822
Thanks a lot.

252
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:46,909
You think you were just going to tilt nipple
to a bunch of no-rank fuzzbutts?

253
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,995
Want me to intro you to your troops?

254
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,581
- No. I'll take care of it.
- Take my pickup.

255
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:53,374
Thanks. Where is it?

256
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,878
<i>You just tell by the sign.
It says, "Sergeant Major."</i>

257
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,729
- Is this Recon Platoon?
- No speak English.

258
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,565
<i>- You?
- No habla.</i>

259
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:49,263
My name is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.

260
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:54,560
<i>I've drunk more beer, pissed more blood,
banged more quiff, busted more balls...</i>

261
00:24:56,312 --> 00:24:58,648
...than all you numbnuts put together.

262
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:01,859
Major Powers has put me in charge
of this Recon Platoon.

263
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,444
We take care of ourselves!

264
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:06,114
You couldn't take care of a wet dream.

265
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:08,658
- God loves you.
- I know that.

266
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,368
You men do not impress me!

267
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:13,788
Recon Platoon kicks butt!

268
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:21,129
You think you can slip and slide just
because your last sergeant was a pussy...

269
00:25:21,212 --> 00:25:23,631
...a short-timer just marking the days.

270
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:27,218
<i>You're going to start acting like Marines,
right now.</i>

271
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:28,886
Who invited you?

272
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,890
I'm not doing this because I want to take
long showers with you assholes.

273
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:36,894
And I don't want to get my head shot off
in some faraway land...

274
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:40,064
<i>...because you don't habla. Comprende?
- Right!</i>

275
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,024
<i>- You?
- Yes, Gunney!</i>

276
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:45,111
<i>"Girl, you know I think you're fine</i>

277
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:48,531
"and you've got that big behind"

278
00:25:57,582 --> 00:25:59,667
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

279
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,341
I'm here to tell you all
that life as you know it has ended.

280
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:11,137
You should all go to town tonight.

281
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:13,556
Laugh and make fools of yourselves.

282
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:18,186
<i>Rub your little peckers against your honey,
or stick it in a knothole in a fence...</i>

283
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:21,856
<i>...but whatever it is, just get rid of it.
Because at 0600 tomorrow...</i>

284
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,151
...your ass is mine.

285
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,402
Where's your bunk?

286
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,658
What's going on?

287
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:46,923
- Let's have it.
- What are you talking about?

288
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:49,675
- The money from my ticket.
- No need to use violence.

289
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:51,928
<i>I'm a Capricorn, a peace lover.</i>

290
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:54,764
I was just a little down on my luck.

291
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:58,684
I got some money right here. It's all I got.

292
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,228
And the meal.

293
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:01,646
- Meal?
- Yes. The meal.

294
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:06,275
- That's really all I've got. Right there.
- And the tip.

295
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,694
- No. That's really it!
- You owe me.

296
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:15,284
<i>It's my will against yours,
and you will lose.</i>

297
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,286
So 0600 tomorrow.

298
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:22,125
<i>That's 6:00 in the morning
for all you people who don't habla.</i>

299
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:26,170
Damn! He just tore off my ear!

300
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:29,382
He's lucky he had a chance to escape
before I kicked his ass...

301
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:32,135
<i>...big leatherneck, jarhead motherfucker!</i>

302
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:35,012
Something must be done
about this Gunney Highway.

303
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:36,848
Yes! But what are we going to do?

304
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:41,227
- Wait till the Swede gets out of the brig!
- That's it! The Swede!

305
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:44,772
- Yes! He'll rip his head off and dump in it!
- Then he'll eat it!

306
00:27:44,856 --> 00:27:47,525
<i>- Yes!
- The Swede! Goodbye, Highway!</i>

307
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,237
Swede! Swede! Swede!

308
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,793
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

309
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,211
I called his wife...

310
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:09,714
Do you fool around on the first date?

311
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:21,809
Damn you.
Don't you know how to write or call?

312
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:25,229
I didn't want to cause you any
sleepless nights thinking about me.

313
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:28,524
- I'll get you a beer.
- Great. I could use one.

314
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:35,323
<i>You look great. They don't make them
like you anymore, sweetheart.</i>

315
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,493
<i>Hell, sure they do.</i>

316
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:43,081
<i>But if you want a lot from a woman,
you have to give a lot.</i>

317
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:45,291
<i>No, not this kid.</i>

318
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:48,836
It seems marriage and the Marine Corps
weren't too compatible.

319
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:53,049
Panther piss. The best years of my life
were with a Marine.

320
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:57,470
<i>If I was a little younger, I'd make you
eat your words, and curl your toes.</i>

321
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,347
I'll bet you could.

322
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:02,642
Aggie always kept a smile on your face.

323
00:29:03,226 --> 00:29:04,727
That was pain.

324
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:06,979
<i>Tom, she's in town.</i>

325
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,777
I figured as much.

326
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:16,239
<i>If she wants more alimony,
she's in trouble.</i>

327
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:21,327
<i>I'm so broke, I couldn't leave if it
took a quarter to go around the world.</i>

328
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:24,080
She's cocktailing over at the Palace.

329
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:28,626
I figured she'd be married
to a general by now.

330
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:33,172
Can I get my old room back?

331
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:35,550
<i>Hell, yes. You going to see her?</i>

332
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:37,718
<i>Hell, no. Can I run a tab on this?</i>

333
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:39,011
<i>Hell, no.</i>

334
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:12,003
<i>And now,
back from an awesomely successful tour...</i>

335
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:15,465
<i>... the Earl of Funk, the Duke of Cool...</i>

336
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:20,636
<i>... the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a,
Stitch Jones!</i>

337
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:24,617
<i>Okay, what will it...</i>

338
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:28,121
Aggie.

339
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,583
- What do you want?
- A beer.

340
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:36,421
- What are you doing here?
- Ordering.

341
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:00,194
You even remembered the brand.

342
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:03,990
<i>Bad whiskey, bad sex and bad men,
I never forget.</i>

343
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:07,368
You didn't talk dirty
when we were married.

344
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:10,872
Always. Only you were
never there to hear it.

345
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,251
<i>Look, Tom, I'm working.</i>

346
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:18,588
- You look great.
- The lights are low.

347
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,258
I mean it.
I'd recognize you coming and going.

348
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:24,552
<i>Please, save the banter for your bimbos.</i>

349
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:28,181
It's late. I'm tired. My feet hurt.
What are you doing here?

350
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:30,641
I'm back with Recon.

351
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:34,353
And you just happened to wander in here?
Ain't life grand?

352
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:38,399
- I didn't come here to fight with you.
- You mean old dogs do learn new tricks?

353
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:42,278
I just came for a beer
and you're ragging my ass already.

354
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,156
<i>Aggie, is there a problem here?</i>

355
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,283
No.

356
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:52,330
I'd like you to meet one of my favorite
exes. This is Thomas Highway.

357
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,582
This is Roy Jennings. He owns the Palace.

358
00:32:58,127 --> 00:33:01,005
I've heard about you
and your bullshit heroics.

359
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:04,634
<i>Now, Roy, Tom is just going to leave.</i>

360
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,474
<i>Aggie, I'll take you home after we close...</i>

361
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,395
...as usual.

362
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:26,030
You sure can pick them.

363
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:28,825
Look who's talking.

364
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:52,724
I'm going to play something from NYC.
I want all of you to rock the house.

365
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:55,143
Fuck rock! Get your hair cut!

366
00:33:58,354 --> 00:34:01,941
<i>You're so ugly, you should be
at the airport, sniffing luggage!</i>

367
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,569
I guess you think you're funny?

368
00:34:05,737 --> 00:34:08,531
<i>All of you, cross your legs,
hold your noses, and fart.</i>

369
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:11,159
- I bet you could clear out your minds!
- Say what?

370
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:15,872
Don't start no S-H.
There won't be no l-T.

371
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:17,623
We have some pretty ladies here.

372
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:20,710
Come have a drink with the nation's finest.

373
00:34:21,836 --> 00:34:22,879
Chill out.

374
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:27,759
<i>Knock it off! Knock it off, goddamn it!</i>

375
00:34:28,176 --> 00:34:29,385
Sit down!

376
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,763
<i>Lay off them, they're not hurting anyone.</i>

377
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:34,974
- Why don't you stay out of this?
- This is none of your business.

378
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:36,893
Are you some kind of smart mouth?

379
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:39,437
I'm just trying to sing a song here.

380
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,230
You get off on rousting Marines?

381
00:34:41,564 --> 00:34:43,733
Leave it alone. It doesn't concern you.

382
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,818
I chew on jarheads and spit them out.

383
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:50,656
You do? Why don't I just bend you over
that table and nail you in the keister?

384
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:52,366
What are you talking about?

385
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:55,078
That's what your persuasion is.
You just said so.

386
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:58,456
I'll send you home with an
"l-just-pumped-the-neighbor's-cat"...

387
00:34:58,539 --> 00:34:59,582
...Iook on your face.

388
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:03,044
What kind of fag talk is that?

389
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:05,171
You have no right to do this!

390
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,632
He's just fucking with you.

391
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:09,509
These guys don't mean nothing.

392
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:13,096
Who'd have the bad sense to fuck with
you in your own place?

393
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,181
Welcome to Fantasy Disco.

394
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:17,850
To hell with both of you.

395
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,438
<i>You're out, Jones. Hit the road.</i>

396
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:25,024
<i>And you watch it, funny man.</i>

397
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:29,028
Get your tight little butt out of here.

398
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,995
I never want to see you here again.

399
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:41,374
<i>I have got a future here, damn it!</i>

400
00:35:41,457 --> 00:35:44,085
- Cocktailing?
- No! With Roy!

401
00:35:44,836 --> 00:35:48,131
I expect a hell of a lot better out of
an ex-wife of mine.

402
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:50,174
He's an improvement over you!

403
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,475
I don't believe this shit!

404
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:02,854
<i>I'd have kicked Jennings' ass,
if I wasn't trying to protect you.</i>

405
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:06,858
So you owe me one. I saved your life.

406
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:10,737
This doesn't mean we'll be
swapping spit in the shower.

407
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:15,074
Fucking big jarhead sucker.

408
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:19,162
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

409
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,914
Off your ass and on your feet. Get up!

410
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:24,417
Knees in the breeze in five minutes.

411
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:27,003
<i>It's 5:00 a.m.! You said, 6:00 a.m.</i>

412
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:28,921
So I can't tell time.

413
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:33,885
Maybe some commie bastard's coming to
pop you a new asshole in the forehead.

414
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,598
Move out! You're Marines now.
You improvise. You adapt. You overcome.

415
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:40,516
Four minutes. Fall out.

416
00:36:44,187 --> 00:36:47,273
We move swift. We move silent.
We move deadly.

417
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:48,941
Only one shake of the whangs.

418
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:52,570
<i>Any more than that constitutes pleasure,
and we're not in that business.</i>

419
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:54,113
<i>Sleep well, Mr. Jones?</i>

420
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:57,366
<i>It's a nightmare.
Wake me up, Mama, please!</i>

421
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,623
<i>- Gunney, platoon's formed for PT.
- Take your post.</i>

422
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:10,213
The Marines are looking
for a few good men.

423
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,924
<i>Unfortunately, you aren't it.</i>

424
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:18,638
We will blaze a path into battle
for others to follow.

425
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:21,307
Surrender is not in our creed.

426
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:22,767
Let's hear you say that.

427
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:24,894
Surrender is not in our creed.

428
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:30,483
<i>Louder, or next time you leave this base,
you'll be collecting pensions.</i>

429
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,486
- Surrender is not in our creed!
- Louder!

430
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:35,446
Surrender is not in our creed!

431
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:40,827
Strip off those t-shirts.

432
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,787
- What?
- What is he talking about?

433
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,832
<i>You'll all wear the same t-shirts,
or none at all.</i>

434
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,015
<i>What's your name, Marine?</i>

435
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,518
<i>Lance Corporal Fragetti, Gunney.</i>

436
00:38:14,777 --> 00:38:19,115
<i>You shouldn't litter, Fag-eddy.
It's ecologically unsound.</i>

437
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:24,912
- What's your name?
- Aponte.

438
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:26,497
- Yours?
- Profile.

439
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:27,749
- Yours?
- Quinones.

440
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,167
- Yours?
- Collins!

441
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:33,004
<i>All right, Colitis.</i>

442
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,881
Cajones.

443
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:37,383
Prophylactics. Ajax.

444
00:38:37,884 --> 00:38:39,552
You boys are handsome.

445
00:38:40,595 --> 00:38:42,013
You look like models.

446
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:45,099
<i>In fact, I want your hair high and tight
tomorrow morning.</i>

447
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:46,893
That's everybody.

448
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,646
<i>When you start looking like Marines,
you'll start feeling like Marines.</i>

449
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,691
<i>Then, goddamn it,
you'll start acting like Marines.</i>

450
00:38:53,775 --> 00:38:55,777
Right face! Forward march!

451
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:21,344
<i>When the Swede gets out of the brig,
this sucker is dead meat!</i>

452
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,596
- You got that right.

- Sure. Why not?

572
00:51:25,693 --> 00:51:28,613
Somebody just look outside

573
00:51:28,696 --> 00:51:32,366
It doesn't matter.
He'll just complain about something else.

574

Life was a lot easier

This is all a question of mind over matter.

We no longer mind

605
00:54:18,741 --> 00:54:21,869
<i>Sir, that's an AK-47 assault weapon.</i>

606
00:54:22,578 --> 00:54:24,414
The preferred weapon of our enemies.

607
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:27,834
<i>It makes a very distinctive sound
when fired at us, sir.</i>

608
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:30,837
<i>Yes, it does. Doesn't it?</i>

609
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:33,381
<i>Good night, Roy.</i>

610
00:54:35,508 --> 00:54:37,510
<i>Hold up, Aggie. I'll follow you home.</i>

611
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:39,971
No. You go ahead. I've got some pains.

612
00:54:42,515 --> 00:54:44,642
<i>- I got it.
- Not tonight, you don't.</i>

613
00:54:53,943 --> 00:54:56,738
<i>"The sensual communication,
meaningful..."</i>

614
00:54:57,572 --> 00:54:58,906
Panther piss.

615
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:03,870
Glad to know some things don't change.
Still know what a woman loves to hear.

616
00:55:06,164 --> 00:55:08,332
I just happened to be in the neighborhood.

617
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:11,794
I thought maybe you'd like to sit down
and we could talk.

618
00:55:11,878 --> 00:55:14,130
Are you reading those magazines?

619
00:55:14,964 --> 00:55:17,258
- What magazines?
- Those magazines.

620
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,639
Somebody must have left them here.

621
00:55:23,723 --> 00:55:24,724
Who?

622
00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:27,435
- Choozoo.
- He doesn't know how to read.

623
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,646
Quit being so stubborn.
Why don't you sit down so we can talk?

624
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,232
I am not one of your troops
that can be bullied.

625
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:38,196
Was being married to me that bad?

626
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:39,864
Yes.

627
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:48,372
Platoon. Attention!

628
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:52,752
<i>Thank you, Gunney!</i>

629
00:55:52,835 --> 00:55:55,296
What a fine morning for a military exercise.

630
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:56,923
Men...

631
00:55:57,215 --> 00:56:01,219
...today we will execute an ambush against
a numerically superior hostile force...

632
00:56:02,136 --> 00:56:06,432
<i>...by using cover, surprise,
interlocking fields of fire...</i>

633
00:56:06,724 --> 00:56:09,769
...and the natural aggressiveness
of the United States Marine.

634
00:56:09,852 --> 00:56:12,688
<i>Show me some poontang,
I'll show you an aggressive Marine!</i>

635
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:15,358
We'll provide Major Powers
and his elite force...

636
00:56:15,441 --> 00:56:18,403
...an accessible target
to sharpen their superior skills.

637
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:22,073
This will be facilitated by
the MILES Gear each team will wear.

638
00:56:22,156 --> 00:56:26,619
<i>When one of our men is shot, these
laser-sensitive vests emit a beeping noise.</i>

639
00:56:28,287 --> 00:56:32,125
<i>Excuse me, Lieutenant?
Are you hinting that we don't fight back?</i>

640
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:36,754
<i>Yes, Gunney. The Major likes to use
the Recon Platoon as a training tool.</i>

641
00:56:36,921 --> 00:56:40,299
What happens when these men go
into combat and they're not prepared?

642
00:56:40,383 --> 00:56:42,260
They just get dead.

643
00:56:43,386 --> 00:56:44,804
Yes. I see what you mean.

644
00:56:44,887 --> 00:56:47,140
Did you discuss this with Major Powers?

645
00:56:51,394 --> 00:56:54,647
<i>- Let's move them out, Gunney.
- Are you coming with us, Lieutenant?</i>

646
00:56:56,607 --> 00:56:59,444
<i>No, Gunney.
I have a doctor's appointment at 1100.</i>

647
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:02,488
I hope it's nothing that will keep you
out of the next war.

648
00:57:03,406 --> 00:57:05,658
<i>Platoon, right face.</i>

649
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,245
Sling arms.

650
00:57:10,037 --> 00:57:12,039
Forward march.

651
00:57:29,348 --> 00:57:31,726
Are you sure Highway's our man
to run the ambush?

652
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:34,312
He's the best I know at small unit tactics.

653
00:57:34,395 --> 00:57:35,730
I doubt that.

654
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:47,075
<i>Marines, today we're going to kick
some Recon ass.</i>

655
00:57:50,244 --> 00:57:53,539
Attention! About face!

656
00:57:54,207 --> 00:57:55,416
Forward march!

657
00:58:10,473 --> 00:58:12,558
When I first joined the Corps...

658
00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:16,687
<i>...I thought I'd be jumping out of planes,
and fighting the enemy.</i>

659
00:58:16,771 --> 00:58:20,691
<i>This is the new, modern, mechanized
Marine Corps. We'll jump out of our heads.</i>

660
00:58:20,775 --> 00:58:22,902
The only enemy we're fighting is boredom.

661
00:58:22,985 --> 00:58:25,446
<i>You hear that voice?
It's calling me, Hollywood.</i>

662
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:28,282
Stitch Jones is going be
a rock and roll star.

663
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:30,576
Don't forget us when you
make it to the top.

664
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,080
<i>Front row center seat, and all the girls
I can't eat for my homeboy.</i>

665
00:58:34,163 --> 00:58:35,832
I love leftovers.

666
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:39,168
Unsling your rifles.
You're making too much noise.

667
00:58:39,252 --> 00:58:43,256
Why? We're not supposed to win.
He watches too much prime time.

668
00:58:53,558 --> 00:58:55,601
<i>- What was that?
- You're dead, Marine.</i>

669
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:59,230
You tripped on four booby traps
that blew your legs off...

670
00:58:59,313 --> 00:59:03,401
...and we have to send out a search party
for your testicles. Where's your backup?

671
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:05,027
Profile.

672
00:59:06,446 --> 00:59:10,116
<i>What good are you back there?
Without any cover fire, I get shot.</i>

673
00:59:10,283 --> 00:59:14,328
<i>While you guys pump the dog,
we get everyone in this platoon killed.</i>

674
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:16,497
Chill out. That's what we're here for.

675
00:59:16,706 --> 00:59:17,874
Say what?

676
00:59:17,957 --> 00:59:21,085
<i>We've ambushed Major Powers
three times, and always right here.</i>

677
00:59:21,169 --> 00:59:22,587
We know what we're doing.

678
00:59:22,837 --> 00:59:26,007
Who says we're going to ambush
Major Powers right here?

679
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,800
Didn't you hear Lieutenant Ring?

680
00:59:27,884 --> 00:59:31,220
<i>Major Powers wants us to die in a loud,
grotesque, military manner.</i>

681
00:59:31,596 --> 00:59:33,598
I don't give a fuck about Major Powers.

682
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,350
My job is to keep you men alive.
Let's move on.

683
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:48,154
Coming to the ambush site
over the next hill.

684
00:59:48,237 --> 00:59:49,572
Roger that.

685
00:59:49,864 --> 00:59:52,950
<i>It helps, knowing when and where
you're going to be hit, sir.</i>

686
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:58,706
<i>Easy. Give them a few more yards,
then we'll nail the coffin shut.</i>

687
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,629
Chill out. Here they come.

688
01:00:05,213 --> 01:00:06,881
Hit them now!

689
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:08,966
Now!

690
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:21,437
Cease fire!

691
01:00:23,398 --> 01:00:25,817
You're in the wrong ambush site!

692
01:00:27,402 --> 01:00:28,903
Cease fire!

693
01:00:33,324 --> 01:00:35,827
They're in the wrong ambush site!

694
01:00:37,203 --> 01:00:39,789
Recon! Recon!

695
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,716
- Sergeant Major!
- Yes?

696
01:00:50,341 --> 01:00:52,343
Turn this damn thing off.

697
01:00:52,969 --> 01:00:55,638
<i>Makes a hell of a racket, doesn't it, sir?</i>

698
01:00:59,726 --> 01:01:03,104
<i>This man usurped authority,
disregarded procedures...</i>

699
01:01:03,187 --> 01:01:07,608
<i>...and ignored my personal directives
all week. Why, Lieutenant?</i>

700
01:01:07,775 --> 01:01:11,279
<i>- Sir, I thought the training...
- You think too much and act too little.</i>

701
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:14,907
You're supposed to be an officer.
Look it up in your leader's handbook.

702
01:01:16,951 --> 01:01:20,288
Who gave you permission to deviate
from the training schedule?

703
01:01:20,371 --> 01:01:22,540
<i>I needed to evaluate my men, sir.</i>

704
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:27,545
<i>They're not your men, you son of a bitch.
They're the U.S. Marine Corps' men.</i>

705
01:01:27,628 --> 01:01:30,882
The 2nd Division's men.
The 8th Marine Regiment's men.

706
01:01:30,965 --> 01:01:33,885
<i>In other words, they're my men.
And so are you. Get it?</i>

707
01:01:34,052 --> 01:01:38,973
I'll get my ass shot off if I'm in a hot
landing zone with an untrained platoon.

708
01:01:39,182 --> 01:01:42,351
You will follow my program to the letter.
No questions asked.

709
01:01:42,435 --> 01:01:45,772
<i>We go into combat tomorrow,
you'll plant half those men.</i>

710
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:52,737
<i>You did it on your own, didn't you?</i>

711
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,823
I can't fix it if I don't know what's broken.

712
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:57,992
You make it easy.

713
01:01:58,076 --> 01:01:59,118
Sir...

714
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:02,580
...I gave Gunney permission
to freelance his...

715
01:02:02,663 --> 01:02:04,999
<i>...I mean, the men, sir.</i>

716
01:02:09,837 --> 01:02:11,255
<i>Wait outside, Ring.</i>

717
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:12,632
<i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

718
01:02:16,844 --> 01:02:19,180
<i>I'm going to run you
out of the Corps, Highway.</i>

719
01:02:19,889 --> 01:02:23,226
<i>The funny thing is, you'll do all the work.</i>

720
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:26,270
<i>Sooner or later, you'll disobey orders...</i>

721
01:02:26,354 --> 01:02:30,274
<i>...circumvent procedures again,
or just get drunk.</i>

722
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:31,984
You can't help it.

723
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,322
<i>You're too old, too stupid and
too prideful to change.</i>

724
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:39,409
I'll enjoy watching you fall.

725
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:43,871
<i>Get out and send in that idiot, Ring.</i>

726
01:02:51,003 --> 01:02:53,089
<i>He wants to see you, Lieutenant.</i>

727
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:57,802
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

728
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,012
Lieutenant?

729
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,181
Recon.

730
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:12,900
You'll let anybody in here. Won't you?

731
01:03:14,026 --> 01:03:16,362
Have one on the house to ease your pain.

732
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:32,545
Want to get drunk and howl at the moon...

733
01:03:33,588 --> 01:03:37,091
<i>...get us both busted back to low-ass,
no-rank, mud-rolling PFC?</i>

734
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:38,926
I'm your man.

735
01:03:39,177 --> 01:03:40,678
<i>What are we, Chooz?</i>

736
01:03:41,888 --> 01:03:46,559
We're short-haired bastards with meat
cleavers for pricks and kerosene for blood.

737
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:49,437
Yes. We're all of that. That's for sure.

738
01:03:51,064 --> 01:03:52,148
We're 0-1-1.

739
01:03:53,441 --> 01:03:54,609
Say again?

740
01:03:55,735 --> 01:04:00,073
<i>Major Powers, one dark cloudy morning,
said to me, "Sergeant Major...</i>

741
01:04:01,157 --> 01:04:02,825
"...you're 0-1-1.

742
01:04:03,284 --> 01:04:06,829
<i>"No wins. One tie, Korea...</i>

743
01:04:07,455 --> 01:04:09,290
<i>"...and one loss, Vietnam."</i>

744
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:15,213
<i>Maybe we lost the war,
but we won the battles.</i>

745
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:21,219
I'm not going to lose the next one
because my men aren't ready.

746
01:04:22,095 --> 01:04:23,554
What are you going to do?

747
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:25,973
Make them Marines.

748
01:04:27,058 --> 01:04:28,559
Stoney Jackson...

749
01:04:28,935 --> 01:04:33,481
<i>...best goddamned platoon sergeant
two short-pricked, piss-ant...</i>

750
01:04:33,606 --> 01:04:36,317
<i>...baby soldier, little fuckers
ever went to war with.</i>

751
01:04:36,651 --> 01:04:39,153
- Yes. Heartbreak Ridge.
- Heartbreak Ridge.

752
01:04:39,404 --> 01:04:41,072
Your CO called.

753
01:04:41,739 --> 01:04:43,825
Your battalion just went on full alert.

754
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,171
God bless.

755
01:04:59,132 --> 01:05:02,093
- I can't find my tent.
- Where's my poncho liner?

756
01:05:02,176 --> 01:05:04,637
<i>Damn it, who's got my web gear?</i>

757
01:05:04,721 --> 01:05:06,889
<i>Profile, that's my canteen.</i>

758
01:05:07,223 --> 01:05:11,394
Aponte better get back here.
He'll do time for being AWOL.

759
01:05:12,562 --> 01:05:16,733
<i>People, let's have an equipment check.
Weapon?</i>

760
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:20,903
Let's keep it simple.

761
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:25,158
<i>You got boots on,
you can walk into combat. Let's go.</i>

762
01:05:29,454 --> 01:05:30,538
Where's Aponte?

763
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:33,833
He's sick. Must've been the chipped beef.
I'm sick myself.

764
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:37,253
- You've eaten worse.
- Only when I'm shit-faced.

765
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:50,266
These DD-13-48 request forms
are not filled out properly.

766
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:54,729
<i>We're going to approach this in an orderly,
proficient manner, Sergeant Major.</i>

767
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:55,855
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

768
01:05:57,148 --> 01:05:59,609
I want you to be sure
that each round of ammo...

769
01:05:59,692 --> 01:06:03,529
...is counted and returned
in the same way it was received.

770
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:08,576
- I'll personally dot the i's and cross the t's.
- Sloppiness breeds inefficiency.

771
01:06:09,577 --> 01:06:12,580
<i>Your outfit could use
some cleaning up, Gunney.</i>

772
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:16,501
<i>Sir, I want to issue my squad leader
some night vision glasses.</i>

773
01:06:16,876 --> 01:06:20,922
- I should've thought of that.
- That is not part of your TO&E.

774
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:22,423
I thought it might...

775
01:06:22,507 --> 01:06:26,177
Fill out the proper request forms
and send it through the chain of command.

776
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,512
Request forms?

777
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:33,309
Attention!

778
01:06:36,229 --> 01:06:38,064
<i>At ease, men.</i>

779
01:06:38,356 --> 01:06:41,984
<i>Major Malcolm Powers, sir.
Annapolis, Class of '71.</i>

780
01:06:43,236 --> 01:06:44,904
<i>How are your men doing, Major?</i>

781
01:06:45,488 --> 01:06:48,908
<i>My men are ready to fight to the death
to protect our country, sir.</i>

782
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,745
Let's hope that won't be necessary.

783
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:56,958
Have we ever served together?

784
01:06:57,542 --> 01:07:00,294
<i>I don't know, sir.
Sergeant Major Choozoo and I...</i>

785
01:07:00,378 --> 01:07:03,047
<i>...were in the 2nd Battalion
in the 7th in 1968.</i>

786
01:07:03,756 --> 01:07:06,592
<i>I had a rifle company in 1st Battalion, 7th.</i>

787
01:07:07,093 --> 01:07:10,096
<i>We sure as hell chewed
some of the same dirt, sir.</i>

788
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:14,475
That's for sure.
What's your assessment of this alert?

789
01:07:14,976 --> 01:07:16,561
It's a cluster fuck.

790
01:07:19,981 --> 01:07:21,065
Say again?

791
01:07:21,149 --> 01:07:24,819
<i>Marines are fighting men, sir,
they shouldn't be sitting on their asses...</i>

792
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:28,656
...filling out forms for equipment
they should already have.

793
01:07:29,574 --> 01:07:31,743
<i>Interesting observation, Gunney.</i>

794
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:34,579
<i>Carry on, Major.</i>

795
01:07:40,918 --> 01:07:43,254
<i>Now hear this. Now hear this.</i>

796
01:07:43,379 --> 01:07:45,465
This is it. We're going to war.

797
01:07:47,008 --> 01:07:51,262
<i>This has been an emergency deployment
readiness exercise.</i>

798
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:56,100
<i>We are standing down.
The alert is cancelled.</i>

799
01:07:56,684 --> 01:07:57,935
Damn it.

800
01:07:59,187 --> 01:08:01,189
<i>Maybe next time, sir.</i>

801
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:04,233
You heard him. Move it out.

802
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:14,702
Aponte.

803
01:08:15,578 --> 01:08:16,913
<i>Oh, him.</i>

804
01:08:17,246 --> 01:08:18,581
Where is he?

805
01:08:19,165 --> 01:08:20,833
What's wrong with you?

806
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,628
Nobody goes over the hill on me.

807
01:08:24,462 --> 01:08:28,633
<i>If you didn't have those stripes,
I'd kick your ass around the block!</i>

808
01:08:28,841 --> 01:08:30,968
<i>Yes, but since I'm not into violence...</i>

809
01:08:31,052 --> 01:08:34,555
...I'll refrain from kicking your ass
at this particular time.

810
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,682
I'll give you a rebate on your life.

811
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:39,685
<i>Besides, who the hell is Aponte?</i>

812
01:08:39,811 --> 01:08:42,814
He ain't heavy
and he sure the hell ain't my brother.

813
01:08:44,232 --> 01:08:45,274
Gunney Highway.

814
01:08:45,691 --> 01:08:47,693
That's right. Gunney Highway.

815
01:08:48,111 --> 01:08:49,362
Come in.

816
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:52,281
<i>I'm sorry, but I had to tell him.</i>

817
01:08:52,365 --> 01:08:55,493
<i>This is my wife, Sara.
Clean that up a little, honey.</i>

818
01:08:55,743 --> 01:08:58,413
<i>Gunney, I filled out all the forms there are.</i>

819
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,791
What the Corps could give
just isn't enough for the family.

820
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,292
So I took a job.

821
01:09:03,376 --> 01:09:05,420
- You got a job?
- Yes.

822
01:09:05,795 --> 01:09:08,881
- You want out of the Marines?
- No! No way.

823
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:12,969
<i>Then we're going to have to cut through
all the red tape B.S., aren't we?</i>

824
01:09:13,052 --> 01:09:14,637
<i>- Yes, we are.
- Knock it off.</i>

825
01:09:16,931 --> 01:09:19,767
Here. Here's a special fund.
Gunnery sergeants only.

826
01:09:23,187 --> 01:09:25,189
<i>Don't worry, you can pay it back.</i>

827
01:09:25,898 --> 01:09:29,110
- Here. You better take him. Jesus Christ.
- Thank you.

828
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:41,080
- What are you smiling at?
- I always knew you were Santa Claus.

829
01:09:41,164 --> 01:09:44,083
You pull another suckhead play like that...

830
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:47,420
...the only thing that will beat you
to the brig is an ambulance.

831
01:09:47,503 --> 01:09:49,756
<i>Yes, sir, Gunnery Sergeant Highway, sir.</i>

832
01:09:54,427 --> 01:09:56,763
You can't leave the Duke of Cool!

833
01:09:57,055 --> 01:09:58,890
This man has no social graces.

834
01:10:03,978 --> 01:10:05,146
So?

835
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:08,858
Lureen down at the Palace
said you had the night off.

836
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:11,235
Lureen talks too much.

837
01:10:11,736 --> 01:10:13,404
Can I buy you a beer?

838
01:10:16,949 --> 01:10:18,284
Jesus.

839
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:24,957
<i>You can't come back after all this time,
with no warning whatsoever.</i>

840
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:28,628
<i>Interfere at my place of work,
almost started a brawl...</i>

841
01:10:28,961 --> 01:10:31,798
...almost lost me the only crummy job
I could find.

842
01:10:32,131 --> 01:10:35,385
<i>Then you show up here,
expecting me to just smooth as silk...</i>

843
01:10:35,468 --> 01:10:37,804
...invite you in for a sit-down and a smile.

844
01:10:38,137 --> 01:10:40,973
<i>It's always the same, Highway.
All balls, no brains.</i>

845
01:10:42,642 --> 01:10:44,477
Is there something you're afraid of?

846
01:10:44,811 --> 01:10:48,940
Yes. I'm afraid I'll dent that
thick skull of yours with this frying pan.

847
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:56,030
<i>- It wouldn't be the first time, would it?
- No.</i>

848
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:01,327
Nice place you have here.

849
01:11:03,204 --> 01:11:05,748
Thanks. You want a glass?

850
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:21,764
- Feet still bothersome?
- I hawk booze five nights a week.

851
01:11:23,099 --> 01:11:26,102
There's no senior prom
looming on my horizon.

852
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:29,021
To the old times.

853
01:11:29,522 --> 01:11:31,858
Just as long as you don't say good times.

854
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:34,360
<i>We had our share of those, too, didn't we?</i>

855
01:11:35,111 --> 01:11:37,363
I don't know. I can't think that far back.

856
01:11:38,448 --> 01:11:40,032
How are you feeling?

857
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:41,784
Terrific.

858
01:11:42,034 --> 01:11:44,036
Absolutely couldn't feel better.

859
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:50,209
What brings you here?

860
01:11:51,377 --> 01:11:54,213
<i>I'm back with Recon, back where I belong.</i>

861
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,259
So?

862
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:00,553
It's different this time.

863
01:12:02,722 --> 01:12:03,806
How?

864
01:12:05,058 --> 01:12:09,228
I'm coming to the end of it.
I don't know where I go from here.

865
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:13,149
I just want it to end
as right as it was when I started.

866
01:12:16,736 --> 01:12:20,239
Do you want some chips? There's pretzels.

867
01:12:21,908 --> 01:12:22,950
<i>Yes, thanks.</i>

868
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,912
Fringe benefits of work.

869
01:12:26,746 --> 01:12:28,247
Tell me something.

870
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:32,251
Did we mutually nurture each other?

871
01:12:33,753 --> 01:12:35,171
I beg your pardon?

872
01:12:35,588 --> 01:12:38,800
Did we communicate in a meaningful way
in our relationship?

873
01:12:39,759 --> 01:12:41,594
Relationship?

874
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:47,600
<i>Hell, I thought we were married.</i>

875
01:12:49,268 --> 01:12:51,938
I've been thinking about the past lately.

876
01:12:54,107 --> 01:12:56,275
I was just wondering what went wrong.

877
01:12:57,276 --> 01:12:58,611
With what?

878
01:13:00,113 --> 01:13:01,447
With me.

879
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:04,117
The Corps. With us.

880
01:13:08,955 --> 01:13:11,124
That is so damn much like you.

881
01:13:11,332 --> 01:13:16,170
You never could see that things just don't
fit neatly into right and wrong.

882
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:18,381
What else is there?

883
01:13:20,466 --> 01:13:22,135
It isn't that simple.

884
01:13:25,805 --> 01:13:28,975
I went by those rooms that we rented
when we got married.

885
01:13:29,308 --> 01:13:30,977
<i>Damn, they're small.</i>

886
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:36,315
They say everything shrinks with age.

887
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:41,821
Tell me something.

888
01:13:43,489 --> 01:13:45,825
What did you want out of our marriage?

889
01:13:49,162 --> 01:13:52,331
We talked once about an avocado ranch...

890
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:55,251
...about buying a house
with a barbecue in the back.

891
01:13:55,668 --> 01:14:00,173
But then you'd volunteer for every damn
war that came down the pike.

892
01:14:04,677 --> 01:14:06,345
- Goddamn it!
- What's the matter?

893
01:14:06,846 --> 01:14:08,848
How could I be so stupid?

894
01:14:09,265 --> 01:14:10,767
What do you mean?

895
01:14:11,017 --> 01:14:15,396
- You changed tactics on me!
- What are you talking about?

896
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,149
<i>Gave up the old frontal assault,
tried to outflank me.</i>

897
01:14:18,232 --> 01:14:21,402
<i>I am onto you, Highway,
and I want you out of here, right now!</i>

898
01:14:21,694 --> 01:14:25,615
You're not acting very dignified
for a mature woman.

899
01:14:27,366 --> 01:14:32,205
<i>You old fucking Marine warhorse,
I'll show you dignified!</i>

900
01:14:32,622 --> 01:14:36,793
You get out of here! Go on!
Get the fuck out of here!

901
01:14:38,044 --> 01:14:40,922
You better get your tail out of here
or I'll get mad!

902
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:43,049
<i>Take that, you old fuck!</i>

903
01:14:43,383 --> 01:14:47,553
<i>I never want to see your craggy,
old face again, you hear?</i>

904
01:14:47,887 --> 01:14:51,057
Don't ever come back. Ever!

905
01:14:52,725 --> 01:14:55,728
<i>She's as crazy as she's always been,
for Christ's sake.</i>

906
01:14:57,397 --> 01:14:59,065
You asshole!

907
01:15:04,404 --> 01:15:06,572
<i>I hate you, Highway!</i>

908
01:15:08,825 --> 01:15:10,034
Fuck you!

909
01:15:23,339 --> 01:15:24,590
<i>Tonight's winner...</i>

910
01:15:25,758 --> 01:15:28,010
<i>... is Miss Sarita Dwayne!</i>

911
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:34,016
<i>Wait a minute, man. That's bullshit.</i>

912
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,768
You're trying to rip me off.

913
01:15:36,102 --> 01:15:37,520
Nobody likes a sore loser.

914
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:40,940
I'm an equal opportunity ass-kicker.
Let's vote.

915
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:42,859
You people have a right to vote.

916
01:15:42,942 --> 01:15:45,445
<i>Whoever voted for Miss Banana Titties,
say, "Yes."</i>

917
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,655
No!

918
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:50,867
<i>All who voted for me,
say, "Rock the house."</i>

919
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:53,786
Rock the house!

920
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:01,377
No man. You all the faggot Mod Squad?

921
01:16:01,794 --> 01:16:05,298
I don't play none of this jail
give-up-the-booty bullshit.

922
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:13,389
Don't ask for my autograph.

923
01:16:16,976 --> 01:16:19,312
You can rob me...

924
01:16:20,313 --> 01:16:23,691
<i>...you can starve me, you can beat me,
and you can kill me...</i>

925
01:16:24,984 --> 01:16:26,986
...just don't bore me.

926
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:36,746
- I'm really glad I could help.
- I owe you another dinner.

927
01:16:47,006 --> 01:16:51,177
Powers will thin-slice your prick
if he finds out about this!

928
01:16:51,427 --> 01:16:53,096
- Sergeant Major!
- Who are you?

929
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:55,598
<i>Jones, 2nd Battalion. Recon Platoon.</i>

930
01:16:57,975 --> 01:17:00,728
<i>Highway's platoon?
Snap to, Marine. Give me a hand.</i>

931
01:17:00,812 --> 01:17:03,523
Highway knows I'm innocent.
We're like brothers.

932
01:17:04,023 --> 01:17:05,691
I posted his bail.

933
01:17:06,025 --> 01:17:08,319
<i>- He needs you, Aggie.
- Until the next war.</i>

934
01:17:09,362 --> 01:17:10,905
Good thing we got him out.

935
01:17:12,115 --> 01:17:13,449
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

936
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,535
Coffee.

937
01:17:20,206 --> 01:17:23,042
I always wanted to check this place out.

938
01:17:23,876 --> 01:17:25,503
Look at all this history.

939
01:17:25,586 --> 01:17:27,922
Little Mary's served Marines
from three wars.

940
01:17:30,049 --> 01:17:31,384
How is he doing?

941
01:17:31,884 --> 01:17:35,054
<i>Aggie will put him back together again,
just like she always has.</i>

942
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:41,894
<i>Highway's something else.
High-speed, low drag.</i>

943
01:17:42,145 --> 01:17:44,814
No one better to be with
if you're in a hot LZ.

944
01:17:45,481 --> 01:17:47,066
Heartbreak Ridge.

945
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:48,818
It was the truth.

946
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,071
What's Heartbreak Ridge?

947
01:17:53,906 --> 01:17:57,577
<i>Listen, we have to understand each other...</i>

948
01:17:58,411 --> 01:18:00,079
...before we go any further.

949
01:18:00,913 --> 01:18:02,749
Are we going any further?

950
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:05,752
You'll be out of the Corps soon.

951
01:18:06,085 --> 01:18:10,089
<i>But you are gung-ho, through and through.
Always will be.</i>

952
01:18:10,423 --> 01:18:14,260
And there is no room in my future
for a Marine.

953
01:18:15,595 --> 01:18:18,097
I'm not sure I like how you say "Marine."

954
01:18:19,766 --> 01:18:23,102
I can say "Marine" any damn way I choose.

955
01:18:23,561 --> 01:18:25,563
I earned that right.

956
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:31,110
<i>- That's right, you did.
- I lived in a rathole...</i>

957
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:35,531
<i>...when they were bringing those boys
home in those flag-draped, metal coffins.</i>

958
01:18:35,615 --> 01:18:38,910
I don't think I got a wink's sleep in 1968.

959
01:18:39,202 --> 01:18:42,580
- Do you remember that year?
- Yes. I remember.

960
01:18:43,623 --> 01:18:48,252
<i>I'd turn on the TV in the morning,
I'd eat dinner in front of it every night...</i>

961
01:18:48,336 --> 01:18:52,090
<i>...eyes glued, hoping to catch
a glimpse of you on the news...</i>

962
01:18:52,173 --> 01:18:54,008
...and then praying I wouldn't.

963
01:18:55,468 --> 01:18:57,887
Then I'd crawl into bed and wonder...

964
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:02,725
...where were you? What were you doing?
Were you alive?

965
01:19:03,309 --> 01:19:05,436
And I had no way of knowing.

966
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:14,987
I guess there are things that work
harder on a woman than being shot at.

967
01:19:16,739 --> 01:19:20,284
I swear the not knowing was the worst.

968
01:19:26,582 --> 01:19:28,000
I'm sorry.

969
01:19:37,677 --> 01:19:39,512
<i>That's all right, baby.</i>

970
01:19:44,183 --> 01:19:45,768
That's all right.

971
01:19:51,274 --> 01:19:54,360
We went up and down that dirt pile
for six days and six nights.

972
01:19:54,444 --> 01:19:58,197
<i>Fixed bayonets, hand-to-hand.
Fought them something fierce.</i>

973
01:19:58,281 --> 01:20:01,200
They gave back as good as they got.
Lots of men died.

974
01:20:01,659 --> 01:20:03,536
We were the 23rd Infantry.

975
01:20:04,037 --> 01:20:05,663
We joined the Corps later.

976
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:08,041
We were younger than you are.

977
01:20:09,417 --> 01:20:11,878
I never heard of any Heartbreak Ridge.

978
01:20:13,087 --> 01:20:16,257
It's not in any of the history books.
It's a little piece of war.

979
01:20:16,674 --> 01:20:18,968
<i>The place didn't have a name,
just a number.</i>

980
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,929
<i>Stoney Jackson looked at it
and said, "Ladies...</i>

981
01:20:22,847 --> 01:20:25,516
<i>"...if this don't kill us, it'll break our hearts."</i>

982
01:20:25,767 --> 01:20:28,227
- Who's Stoney Jackson?
- Little Mary's husband.

983
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:31,147
He was our platoon sergeant.

984
01:20:31,272 --> 01:20:34,275
He recommended Highway
for his Congressional Medal of Honor.

985
01:20:35,943 --> 01:20:38,237
Gunney Highway won the CMH?

986
01:20:39,363 --> 01:20:42,200
He charged two machine gun nests
by himself.

987
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:44,410
He didn't sleep for three days.

988
01:20:44,535 --> 01:20:47,372
The final human wave he held off
almost single-handedly.

989
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:49,832
When it was over...

990
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:53,294
<i>...there was me, Stoney Jackson...</i>

991
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:55,505
...and Tom Highway.

992
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,091
We were the only ones still alive.

993
01:20:59,509 --> 01:21:01,552
What happened to Jackson?

994
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:04,138
He was killed at Khe Sahn in 1968.

995
01:21:04,305 --> 01:21:07,308
Can I get you something to eat?
I can fix it in no time.

996
01:21:10,019 --> 01:21:11,479
<i>No, thank you, ma'am.</i>

997
01:21:15,149 --> 01:21:18,069
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.
You don't happen to be up...</i>

998
01:21:18,194 --> 01:21:20,863
<i>...when Gunney Highway
leaves for the base, do you?</i>

999
01:21:20,947 --> 01:21:23,241
I pour his coffee and lay out his things.

1000
01:21:46,097 --> 01:21:47,473
<i>Platoon, attention!</i>

1001
01:21:50,184 --> 01:21:51,185
Right face!

1002
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,688
Forward march!

1003
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:07,160
Each platoon will proceed
to the objective...

1004
01:22:07,285 --> 01:22:09,746
...which in this case
is the Battalion Bear Pit.

1005
01:22:10,288 --> 01:22:13,207
<i>Whoever reaches it first
will get a 72- hour liberty.</i>

1006
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:17,170
<i>Sir, it would be an honor,
if you would accompany my platoon.</i>

1007
01:22:19,088 --> 01:22:20,798
<i>Thank you, Staff Sergeant.</i>

1008
01:22:27,096 --> 01:22:28,723
Get out of your seats.

1009
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:55,249
<i>Johanson, tighten up that harness.</i>

1010
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,337
<i>- Gunney, I'm afraid of heights.
- So am I.</i>

1011
01:22:59,587 --> 01:23:00,588
You are?

1012
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:04,092
Jumping out of a perfectly good airplane
is not a natural act...

1013
01:23:04,217 --> 01:23:06,886
...so let's do it right and enjoy the view.

1014
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,516
Let's move.

1015
01:23:54,642 --> 01:23:57,562
We made it. We're the first platoon
to reach the Bear Pit.

1016
01:23:57,979 --> 01:23:59,605
<i>Not so quick, sir.</i>

1017
01:24:02,483 --> 01:24:04,777
Darn. 1st Platoon.

1018
01:24:05,737 --> 01:24:06,946
Major. It's Highway.

1019
01:24:08,489 --> 01:24:09,657
Damn.

1020
01:24:09,907 --> 01:24:12,201
<i>Come on, let's smoke 'em.</i>

1021
01:24:13,161 --> 01:24:15,121
<i>1st Platoon, follow me!</i>

1022
01:24:37,894 --> 01:24:39,437
Recon wins.

1023
01:24:40,354 --> 01:24:44,484
<i>Gunney, you don't know your place.
1st Platoon is the victor!</i>

1024
01:24:45,443 --> 01:24:47,403
<i>I say we have ourselves a dilemma, sir.</i>

1025
01:24:48,613 --> 01:24:52,825
<i>Sergeant Major, as my umpire, I order you
to declare 1st Platoon the winner.</i>

1026
01:24:53,743 --> 01:24:55,953
<i>Sir, that wouldn't be fair.</i>

1027
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,540
What do you propose to resolve
this situation?

1028
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:00,958
Match-up.

1029
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:04,253
<i>Okay, men, get them off.</i>

1030
01:25:05,546 --> 01:25:07,340
Get your shit off.

1031
01:25:44,669 --> 01:25:46,546
Get them out!

1032
01:25:51,926 --> 01:25:53,720
Get them out!

1033
01:26:30,131 --> 01:26:31,591
Recon!

1034
01:26:36,137 --> 01:26:37,930
<i>Sergeant Major, 1st Platoon wins.</i>

1035
01:26:40,016 --> 01:26:41,726
<i>I don't see it that way, Major.</i>

1036
01:26:41,851 --> 01:26:44,937
<i>You're out of order, Gunney.
1st Platoon is king of the pit.</i>

1037
01:26:45,063 --> 01:26:47,607
- How do you figure?
- Your man cheated.

1038
01:26:47,732 --> 01:26:48,983
<i>I say, he improvised.</i>

1039
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,151
He cheated!

1040
01:26:50,401 --> 01:26:51,861
He adapted. He overcame.

1041
01:26:53,404 --> 01:26:55,281
There's only one way to settle this.

1042
01:26:55,865 --> 01:26:58,368
<i>Platoon sergeants, front and center.</i>

1043
01:27:00,411 --> 01:27:03,247
<i>Remember, Sergeant,
I'm leading your platoon today.</i>

1044
01:27:04,665 --> 01:27:07,668
<i>Old man, it's time somebody
put you in your place.</i>

1045
01:28:22,785 --> 01:28:26,039
It felt great beating
Major Powers' elite fighting unit!

1046
01:28:27,874 --> 01:28:30,418
I've been bitten by every bug
known to mankind.

1047
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:33,171
<i>With all these bumps,
you look like you got muscles.</i>

1048
01:28:34,505 --> 01:28:36,049
I bet I have poison ivy.

1049
01:28:36,174 --> 01:28:39,427
You can get permanent light duty
for all of the crud on your body.

1050
01:28:40,094 --> 01:28:44,098
Your dream come true. You won't
have to do this bullshit any more.

1051
01:28:44,265 --> 01:28:46,392
Fuck you. I'm getting pretty good at this.

1052
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:50,772
<i>This man must be sick,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1053
01:28:51,272 --> 01:28:52,732
I'll tell you who's sick...

1054
01:28:52,857 --> 01:28:57,570
...Gunney Highway is the sickest
individual I've ever come across.

1055
01:28:57,653 --> 01:29:01,157
That's right! Order today and get
this record set from Recon Records...

1056
01:29:01,282 --> 01:29:03,910
<i>...with songs like,
Highway's a Sick Individual...</i>

1057
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:06,746
<i>...Polish My Weapon and I'll Polish Yours.</i>

1058
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:08,664
That's my song! I like that one!

1059
01:29:08,956 --> 01:29:11,084
<i>Bionic Marine.</i>

1060
01:29:12,126 --> 01:29:14,587
<i>- That's it! Bionic Marine.
- Yes, do that one!</i>

1061
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:19,008
<i>"We kicked a lot of ass,
at a place called Heartbreak Ridge</i>

1062
01:29:19,133 --> 01:29:23,262
<i>"Don't fuck with Scarface Highway,
baddest jarhead there is</i>

1063
01:29:24,055 --> 01:29:27,308
<i>"He's a bad, psycho mother, bionic Marine</i>

1064
01:29:27,767 --> 01:29:31,437
<i>"A leatherneck lifer,
who likes the barracks clean</i>

1065
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:35,066
- "He kicked Powers in the ass
- "Whipped him upside the head

1066
01:29:35,191 --> 01:29:39,028
<i>"If you fuck with this sick mother,

or you'll end up in the brig"</i>

1071
01:29:59,132 --> 01:30:00,842
I'll tell you something else.

1072
01:30:00,925 --> 01:30:04,262
Highway won the Congressional
Medal of Honor at Heartbreak Ridge.

1073
01:30:04,387 --> 01:30:05,930
- Check that out.
- The CMH!

1074
01:30:06,055 --> 01:30:08,558
<i>I knew he was bad, but not that bad.</i>

1075
01:30:09,684 --> 01:30:12,520
Major Powers wants statements
from each and every of you.

1076
01:30:14,272 --> 01:30:16,065
What kind of statement?

1077
01:30:16,357 --> 01:30:19,026
Gunnery Sergeant Highway
used live ammunition...

1078
01:30:19,569 --> 01:30:22,739
...with unauthorized weapons
in the training exercise.

1079
01:30:24,532 --> 01:30:25,992
Says who?

1080
01:30:26,576 --> 01:30:28,703
I thought you guys didn't like Highway.

1081
01:30:29,954 --> 01:30:32,790
<i>I heard that AK-47 fire
coming from your AO.</i>

1082
01:30:34,751 --> 01:30:37,128
Don't you want to go back
to the way it was?

1083
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,048
Nobody fucking with you?

1084
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:46,304
Seems to me that no one is going
to fuck with us the way things are now.

1085
01:30:47,055 --> 01:30:49,891
There's weekend liberty in it for all of you.

1086
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:52,018
I'll start with you.

1087
01:30:53,311 --> 01:30:54,937
I got nothing to say.

1088
01:30:56,105 --> 01:30:58,232
<i>- You?
- No hablo ingles.</i>

1089
01:30:59,358 --> 01:31:03,196
This can go hard on you all
if you aren't going to cooperate.

1090
01:31:06,324 --> 01:31:08,618
<i>We don't have anything
to say to you, Webster.</i>

1091
01:31:10,453 --> 01:31:14,290
Why don't you take your ass back
to that 1st Platoon of yours...

1092
01:31:14,499 --> 01:31:17,919
...and don't go away mad. Just go away.

1093
01:31:18,836 --> 01:31:20,463
You've been told.

1094
01:31:35,937 --> 01:31:38,564
- I hate social functions.
- You're going to love it.

1095
01:31:39,148 --> 01:31:42,318
Your presence is requested
at the MAU Commander's open house.

1096
01:31:42,443 --> 01:31:44,570
- Full military dress.
- Piss on that.

1097
01:31:45,196 --> 01:31:47,657
<i>You'll be there,
Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway.</i>

1098
01:31:48,116 --> 01:31:50,785
<i>Stand tall, look sharp,
and wear all your ribbons...</i>

1099
01:31:50,868 --> 01:31:53,538
...so these people can see
a hero who isn't dead.

1100
01:31:53,996 --> 01:31:55,790
- Let's find the bar.
- Good idea.

1101
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:00,795
How are you this evening? Thank you.

1102
01:32:02,672 --> 01:32:05,133
I'm privileged to greet
a Medal of Honor winner.

1103
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:06,634
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

1104
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:10,388
Run into any cluster fucks lately?

1105
01:32:12,598 --> 01:32:14,392
<i>No. Not lately, sir.</i>

1106
01:32:14,559 --> 01:32:16,936
Thanks for stopping by. Enjoy the party.

1107
01:32:20,148 --> 01:32:24,610
I love to see the brass snap to attention
when they see that little ribbon.

1108
01:32:24,736 --> 01:32:27,989
<i>What do you do at a party like this,
stick out your little pinkie?</i>

1109
01:32:28,072 --> 01:32:30,908
Just don't unzip and stick Old Blue out.

1110
01:32:31,284 --> 01:32:34,454
Didn't J.J. Johnson do that at
a WAVE party in San Diego?

1111
01:32:34,579 --> 01:32:38,708
No! That was me. J.J. Mooned
the ARVN General at China Beach.

1112
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:44,881
Let's drink a toast to J.J. And
all of the pieces of him we couldn't find.

1113
01:32:45,006 --> 01:32:46,466
Funniest guy I ever met.

1114
01:32:47,967 --> 01:32:51,471
<i>One thing about a party like this,
the conversation is so adult.</i>

1115
01:32:55,266 --> 01:32:58,519
<i>Choozoo, I think I'm going to head
for the back door of this place.</i>

1116
01:32:58,644 --> 01:33:00,104
And lose all this joy?

1117
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:03,649
<i>You won't be upset if I cut in, will you?</i>

1118
01:33:03,775 --> 01:33:04,942
I'll get over it.

1119
01:33:05,526 --> 01:33:07,403
I'll go see what the chow's like.

1120
01:33:08,363 --> 01:33:10,073
Would you like to dance?

1121
01:33:12,367 --> 01:33:15,286
- What are you doing here?
- I'm still on the mailing list.

1122
01:33:16,704 --> 01:33:17,705
- Yes?
- Yes.

1123
01:33:42,063 --> 01:33:43,523
What's so funny?

1124
01:33:44,315 --> 01:33:47,819
<i>I was just thinking,
this reminds me of the Senior Prom...</i>

1125
01:33:47,902 --> 01:33:49,946
...and the chaperone with the ruler.

1126
01:33:50,071 --> 01:33:53,658
<i>"Now, Agnes Ann, you remember,
you keep eight inches of daylight...</i>

1127
01:33:53,783 --> 01:33:56,536
"...between you and that young man
you're dancing with."

1128
01:33:57,036 --> 01:33:58,746
Yes. I do remember that.

1129
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:02,834
Wasn't that the first night we ever...

1130
01:34:03,376 --> 01:34:05,670
<i>Yes. Yes, it was.</i>

1131
01:34:06,212 --> 01:34:09,549
<i>Agnes Ann,
you were a wild creature, I must say.</i>

1132
01:34:12,093 --> 01:34:14,137
What do your magazines say about that?

1133
01:34:14,846 --> 01:34:17,306
I don't know.
I haven't gotten to that part yet.

1134
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:18,850
Are you still reading them?

1135
01:34:19,058 --> 01:34:20,226
Affirmative.

1136
01:34:20,435 --> 01:34:22,395
What do they say about ex-wives?

1137
01:34:24,605 --> 01:34:28,109
Not too much.
Just that sex is great because...

1138
01:34:28,192 --> 01:34:32,030
...you don't have to establish
a relationship or be meaningful.

1139
01:34:35,033 --> 01:34:39,412
<i>- You really are trying to understand us.
- The best I can, yes.</i>

1140
01:34:39,954 --> 01:34:43,875
Is that because you can't be a Marine
anymore and you have no place to go?

1141
01:34:45,376 --> 01:34:47,420
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

1142
01:34:48,629 --> 01:34:49,839
That's all right.

1143
01:34:50,006 --> 01:34:52,300
We've known each other too long...

1144
01:34:52,383 --> 01:34:56,137
...to run away just over a little thing
like tearing each other's guts out.

1145
01:34:56,345 --> 01:34:58,890
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

1146
01:35:00,475 --> 01:35:02,769
It never seems to work out
between you and me.

1147
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:07,523
- With her husband.
- I see.

1148
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:11,319
- I'm having a great time.
- It's a whole family gathering.

1149
01:35:12,987 --> 01:35:17,450
I've been thinking about
that avocado ranch we talked about.

1150
01:35:17,575 --> 01:35:19,869
<i>Tom, Roy has asked me to marry him.</i>

1151
01:35:21,245 --> 01:35:22,622
What'd you say?

1152
01:35:26,209 --> 01:35:27,377
<i>Attention, please!</i>

1153
01:35:28,878 --> 01:35:32,548
<i>The 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit's alert
status has been upgraded.</i>

1154
01:35:33,216 --> 01:35:37,512
<i>All officers and staff NCOs
will return immediately to their units.</i>

1155
01:35:37,929 --> 01:35:38,930
<i>Thank you.</i>

1156
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:28,646
<i>This is another bullshit alert, right?</i>

1157
01:36:29,147 --> 01:36:30,440
<i>We're going to war, men.</i>

1158
01:36:32,942 --> 01:36:37,739
We're going to assist with the rescue of
American citizens on the island of Grenada.

1159
01:36:38,573 --> 01:36:39,782
The island of what?

1160
01:36:39,907 --> 01:36:43,244
Grenada. It's a Caribbean island
also known as "the Isle of Spice."

1161
01:36:43,369 --> 01:36:45,872
It's 86 nautical miles from Venezuela.

1162
01:36:45,997 --> 01:36:49,333
Our mission is to helo-cast
into a small bay...

1163
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:51,711
...and recon before
the Marine landing force.

1164
01:36:51,794 --> 01:36:54,630
<i>No, I can't do that. I forgot my suntan oil.</i>

1165
01:36:55,423 --> 01:36:57,550
It's time to earn your pay. Let's move.

1166
01:36:57,967 --> 01:36:59,302
Pick it up. Let's go.

1167
01:37:10,813 --> 01:37:15,443
<i>Now hear this! Now hear this!
Flight deck, prepare to launch helo.</i>

1168
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:11,100
Your glasses.

1169
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,227
Get ready.

1170
01:39:47,011 --> 01:39:48,554
<i>Choozoo, do you read me?</i>

1171
01:39:50,556 --> 01:39:53,142
<i>Choozoo, this is Highway.
Do you read me?</i>

1172
01:39:53,309 --> 01:39:56,396
Battalion wants your platoon to recon
toward the university.

1173
01:39:56,562 --> 01:39:58,189
You stay low around Powers.

1174
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:04,070
See you when it's over.

1175
01:40:30,054 --> 01:40:31,681
Spread out.

1176
01:40:35,852 --> 01:40:37,103
What was that?

1177
01:40:37,729 --> 01:40:42,442
<i>An AK-47. It has a distinctive sound.
Proceed swiftly and with caution, brothers.</i>

1178
01:40:42,608 --> 01:40:45,778
- Get that 60 going around the corner.
- All right.

1179
01:40:59,834 --> 01:41:01,294
Cover my ass.

1180
01:41:15,683 --> 01:41:16,934
<i>Highway's crazy, man.</i>

1181
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:43,252
<i>They've pulled out, Lieutenant.</i>

1182
01:41:43,795 --> 01:41:45,171
<i>All right, Aponte.</i>

1183
01:41:46,005 --> 01:41:47,340
Slowly.

1184
01:42:25,253 --> 01:42:26,546
Cubans.

1185
01:42:27,797 --> 01:42:29,924
Three-man recon team.

1186
01:42:30,925 --> 01:42:34,095
We better spread out.
I'm sure they've got buddies around here.

1187
01:42:35,012 --> 01:42:36,305
Let's go.

1188
01:42:37,223 --> 01:42:39,517
Spread the fuck out. Let's go.

1189
01:43:10,381 --> 01:43:11,549
Go ahead.

1190
01:43:18,056 --> 01:43:19,223
Go ahead.

1191
01:43:29,525 --> 01:43:33,446
We forgot the beer and the hotdogs.
I'll go back to New York and get them.

1192
01:43:33,571 --> 01:43:38,284
<i>- You run engines as good as your mouth?
- Jones is the name, hot wire is the game.</i>

1193
01:43:38,368 --> 01:43:40,328
<i>Fragetti, go with him.</i>

1194
01:43:48,461 --> 01:43:50,254
- You set? Let's go.
- Let's do it.

1195
01:43:50,671 --> 01:43:52,715
<i>Swede, get up there with that M-60.</i>

1196
01:44:16,864 --> 01:44:17,865
Yes!

1197
01:44:32,046 --> 01:44:34,799
Here comes
the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.

1198
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:42,014
<i>You stay right there, sucker.</i>

1199
01:45:23,347 --> 01:45:24,724
Stay low.

1200
01:46:13,022 --> 01:46:14,482
Jesus.

1201
01:46:15,483 --> 01:46:16,943
Please forgive me.

1202
01:46:23,074 --> 01:46:24,534
Let's go.

1203
01:46:44,887 --> 01:46:48,057
<i>Get in there. Tell them who you are,
so no friendlies get hurt.</i>

1204
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:51,394
<i>Hello, happening hostages.
I'm Stitch Jones, Mr. Funkadelic.</i>

1205
01:46:51,477 --> 01:46:53,104
<i>Try "U.S. Marine," shithead.</i>

1206
01:47:17,295 --> 01:47:18,504
All clear.

1207
01:47:34,645 --> 01:47:36,105
United States Marines!

1208
01:47:50,078 --> 01:47:51,454
You've improved.

1209
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:54,123
Goddamn it. Gunney!

1210
01:48:09,847 --> 01:48:11,808
<i>U.S. Marines, ma'am.</i>

1211
01:48:19,232 --> 01:48:21,693
- U.S. Marines!
- Is everybody all right?

1212
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:33,037
<i>You know what they say about college,
a behind is a terrible thing to waste.</i>

1213
01:48:33,121 --> 01:48:37,250
Delta Company said they will give us
surfboards and let us go to the beach.

1214
01:48:37,375 --> 01:48:40,712
One student kissed me four times.
I think I'm in love.

1215
01:48:40,878 --> 01:48:43,881
<i>- Was he good-Iooking, Profile?
- It was a girl, Gunney.</i>

1216
01:48:43,965 --> 01:48:46,092
Clean your weapons. Check your ammo.

1217
01:48:48,219 --> 01:48:51,222
<i>All secured, sir.
No casualties, no sign of enemy.</i>

1218
01:48:51,305 --> 01:48:54,726
Very good. I want to get some pictures
before we wrap this mission.

1219
01:48:55,017 --> 01:48:57,937
<i>We've encountered some heavy resistance
along the way, sir.</i>

1220
01:48:58,104 --> 01:49:00,398
- Probably local fanatics.
- Negative.

1221
01:49:00,481 --> 01:49:02,525
Cuban regulars with Russian rifles.

1222
01:49:02,775 --> 01:49:05,319
That data has already been factored in.

1223
01:49:05,445 --> 01:49:07,905
- Sergeant? It's Battalion.
- Go ahead.

1224
01:49:09,282 --> 01:49:13,286
<i>Big Daddy says, "Get off your ass
and get back in the war." His words, sir.</i>

1225
01:49:14,662 --> 01:49:16,539
He says he wants to recon that hill.

1226
01:49:16,831 --> 01:49:19,208
He says one of our fly-fly boys
saw some armor.

1227
01:49:19,292 --> 01:49:21,252
You're full of all kinds of good news.

1228
01:49:21,544 --> 01:49:23,254
You're too ugly to live forever.

1229
01:49:24,255 --> 01:49:25,715
<i>Gunney, recon that hill.</i>

1230
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:30,386
Wait for Foxtrot Company before
launching any assault. Stay in contact.

1231
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:34,640
<i>Shall I send back data, sir,
or is that already factored in?</i>

1232
01:49:35,266 --> 01:49:36,726
Move out.

1233
01:49:38,227 --> 01:49:42,148
I think Powers is hot for you.
You better watch your back.

1234
01:49:42,231 --> 01:49:44,692
<i>Let's move out, Recon. Form up.</i>

1235
01:50:02,001 --> 01:50:03,169
Keep moving.

1236
01:50:18,226 --> 01:50:19,685
Get down.

1237
01:51:27,462 --> 01:51:29,672
<i>Bad mistake, coming in here like this.</i>

1238
01:51:29,797 --> 01:51:33,551
<i>- It's my fault, Gunney. I led them up here.
- Apologize to their mothers.</i>

1239
01:51:33,676 --> 01:51:34,927
<i>Jesus, Gunney!</i>

1240
01:51:36,512 --> 01:51:38,723
Lay some steel on those targets there.

1241
01:51:39,557 --> 01:51:40,558
Aponte!

1242
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,354
Radio Battalion for air support.

1243
01:51:45,605 --> 01:51:47,482
<i>Gunney, I think Profile is dead.</i>

1244
01:52:01,996 --> 01:52:03,790
<i>Don't let him die, Gunney.</i>

1245
01:52:05,541 --> 01:52:07,168
That's not up to me.

1246
01:52:07,585 --> 01:52:10,338
<i>Come on. Stay down, everyone. Let's go.</i>

1247
01:52:16,344 --> 01:52:17,970
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

1248
01:52:18,221 --> 01:52:20,181
Doing better than Profile.

1249
01:52:20,473 --> 01:52:22,100
I can still fight.

1250
01:52:22,725 --> 01:52:24,185
We'll make it out of here?

1251
01:52:24,268 --> 01:52:26,562
<i>- You got a date, Collins?
- You never know.</i>

1252
01:52:30,566 --> 01:52:32,193
<i>Gunney, I got Profile killed.</i>

1253
01:52:32,276 --> 01:52:35,947
<i>It was his time.
And when it's your time, your time is up.</i>

1254
01:52:36,072 --> 01:52:37,865
I could have gotten them all killed.

1255
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:41,077
<i>Yes, but you didn't.
Just don't make the same mistake twice.</i>

1256
01:52:41,369 --> 01:52:42,370
Right.

1257
01:52:42,787 --> 01:52:45,456
I think I figured out a way to call
an air strike...

1258
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,834
...if we can find out where this line is cut.

1259
01:52:47,959 --> 01:52:48,960
Jones!

1260
01:52:49,961 --> 01:52:52,880
<i>- That's my name, loving's my game.
- Thanks for volunteering.</i>

1261
01:52:53,589 --> 01:52:54,590
Say what?

1262
01:52:54,799 --> 01:52:57,635
Get on the roof.
Find out where this line is cut.

1263
01:52:58,052 --> 01:53:00,263
<i>Come on, men. Don't stand there, damn it.</i>

1264
01:53:13,818 --> 01:53:17,155
<i>I wish I was back in New Jersey,
watching The Flintstones.</i>

1265
01:53:17,405 --> 01:53:19,198
This is bullshit.

1266
01:53:23,536 --> 01:53:26,122
Don't you motherfuckers know
who you're shooting at?

1267
01:53:26,247 --> 01:53:28,541
I'm the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.

1268
01:53:29,542 --> 01:53:34,005
<i>Big banana-eating, bean-farting
motherfuckers don't speak English.</i>

1269
01:53:34,714 --> 01:53:35,715
Hello?

1270
01:53:36,049 --> 01:53:37,050
Hello?

1271
01:53:38,426 --> 01:53:39,427
It works.

1272
01:53:39,844 --> 01:53:42,930
<i>Damn right, it works.
I almost got my ass shot off for Ma Bell.</i>

1273
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:45,516
Hello? Operator?

1274
01:53:45,975 --> 01:53:49,812
<i>Yes. I want to make an emergency,
long distance call...</i>

1275
01:53:49,937 --> 01:53:53,608
<i>...to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
Collect.</i>

1276
01:53:55,151 --> 01:53:56,152
What?

1277
01:53:57,904 --> 01:54:00,823
Anybody have a credit card?
They won't make collect calls.

1278
01:54:04,952 --> 01:54:08,623
<i>Have no fear. Stitch is here, and
I never go to combat without my plastic.</i>

1279
01:54:12,794 --> 01:54:13,795
Yes.

1280
01:54:14,379 --> 01:54:16,089
6-6-0...

1281
01:54:16,339 --> 01:54:18,049
...5- 5-8...

1282
01:54:18,633 --> 01:54:20,510
<i>...0- 7- 1-1...</i>

1283
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:23,638
Camp Lejeune?

1284
01:54:24,555 --> 01:54:26,182
Are you for real?

1285
01:54:27,558 --> 01:54:31,312
Grid 2-1-9...

1286
01:54:31,813 --> 01:54:36,526
...6- 3-2-1-8.

1287
01:54:38,861 --> 01:54:41,531
- Did they get it?
- I don't know. The phone went dead.

1288
01:54:43,282 --> 01:54:44,283
Give me that.

1289
01:54:47,161 --> 01:54:48,705
<i>Gunney, where are you going?</i>

1290
01:54:49,455 --> 01:54:52,125
<i>If they don't see our marker,
we'll be in real trouble.</i>

1291
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:54,210
But you don't know if we got through.

1292
01:54:54,377 --> 01:54:56,003
<i>We'll have to improvise, sir.</i>

1293
01:55:14,939 --> 01:55:16,232
Highway's been hit!

1294
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:24,574
<i>What are we going to do, sir?</i>

1295
01:55:29,746 --> 01:55:31,080
Let's go.

1296
01:56:04,238 --> 01:56:05,782
<i>Don't die, man.</i>

1297
01:56:08,826 --> 01:56:09,827
Gunney!

1298
01:56:12,413 --> 01:56:13,414
Jones.

1299
01:56:15,249 --> 01:56:18,836
Just because we are holding hands
doesn't mean we'll take warm showers...

1300
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:21,672
...until the wee hours of the morning.
You hear me?

1301
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:26,010
- I thought you were dead.
- Wishful thinking.

1302
01:56:31,099 --> 01:56:33,393
<i>Lieutenant, what are we waiting for?</i>

1303
01:56:34,602 --> 01:56:38,731
<i>All right, you devil dogs,
let's take that fucking hill!</i>

1304
01:58:58,121 --> 01:58:59,122
Go!

1305
01:59:10,133 --> 01:59:11,676
Get them out of there.

1306
01:59:13,219 --> 01:59:15,263
Move it! Get your hands up!

1307
01:59:36,868 --> 01:59:38,161
<i>All secure, sir!</i>

1308
01:59:38,995 --> 01:59:41,039
<i>- Corporal Jones!
- Yes, sir!</i>

1309
01:59:43,166 --> 01:59:44,417
Move them out.

1310
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,294
<i>You heard him, men! Move them out!</i>

1311
02:00:27,794 --> 02:00:30,797
Just what the hell do you think
you were doing?

1312
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:37,261
<i>Just enjoying the view, sir.</i>

1313
02:00:38,763 --> 02:00:40,390
You disobeyed a direct order.

1314
02:00:42,058 --> 02:00:45,728
I told you to stay in contact
and not take this hill without me.

1315
02:00:48,064 --> 02:00:50,024
<i>Get on your feet, Highway!</i>

1316
02:00:52,276 --> 02:00:56,489
<i>With all due respect, sir,
you're beginning to bore the hell out of me.</i>

1317
02:01:33,276 --> 02:01:36,112
<i>- Who's in charge here?
- I am, sir. Major Malcolm Powers.</i>

1318
02:01:36,696 --> 02:01:38,239
Did you lead this assault?

1319
02:01:39,365 --> 02:01:43,036
<i>Lieutenant Ring and Gunnery Sergeant
Highway disobeyed a direct order, sir.</i>

1320
02:01:43,953 --> 02:01:47,290
<i>I told them to wait for support,
but they still charged this hill.</i>

1321
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:48,624
Why?

1322
02:01:48,833 --> 02:01:51,753
<i>Because we're paid to improvise, sir.
To overcome, to adapt.</i>

1323
02:01:51,836 --> 02:01:53,963
<i>I gave the order to take this hill, sir.</i>

1324
02:01:54,255 --> 02:01:56,549
<i>Ring, this is going to ruin your career.</i>

1325
02:01:58,509 --> 02:02:02,013
<i>- Are you new to the infantry, Major?
- Yes, sir. I came over from Supply.</i>

1326
02:02:02,138 --> 02:02:03,931
<i>- Were you good at that?
- Yes, sir!</i>

1327
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:08,436
<i>Then stick to it, because you're
a cluster fuck as an infantry officer.</i>

1328
02:02:08,603 --> 02:02:10,730
<i>This is a Marine Amphibious Unit, Major.</i>

1329
02:02:10,855 --> 02:02:12,482
My men are hard chargers.

1330
02:02:12,565 --> 02:02:15,318
Ring and Highway
took a handful of young fire-pissers...

1331
02:02:15,443 --> 02:02:18,154
<i>...exercised some personal initiative,
and kicked ass!</i>

1332
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:22,533
<i>- Good work, Lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir!</i>

1333
02:02:23,076 --> 02:02:26,579
<i>Lieutenant, see that those students
are escorted back to Cherry Point.</i>

1334
02:02:29,082 --> 02:02:30,541
You're dismissed!

1335
02:02:51,354 --> 02:02:54,524
What are you two sorry-assed individuals
looking at?

1336
02:02:54,649 --> 02:02:56,275
Get out of my LZ.

1337
02:02:57,860 --> 02:02:59,404
<i>Semper Fi.</i>

1338
02:03:04,283 --> 02:03:07,537
<i>Chooz, I guess we're not 0-1-1 now.</i>

1339
02:03:47,410 --> 02:03:49,287
- There's my family.
- All right.

1340
02:03:49,912 --> 02:03:51,706
- Got anybody here?
- No.

1341
02:03:51,789 --> 02:03:55,543
But it's a beautiful day
and I'm ready to play.

1342
02:03:55,668 --> 02:03:58,671
<i>- Give them hell, man.
- Definitely.</i>

1343
02:04:11,309 --> 02:04:15,772
<i>Like I said, I'm ready to play.
You know what I mean?</i>

1344
02:04:16,314 --> 02:04:18,274
<i>Anytime, man.</i>

1345
02:04:18,775 --> 02:04:20,318
You'll be a civilian soon.

1346
02:04:20,401 --> 02:04:24,781
<i>Grow your hair long, sleep late,
become an asshole rock and roll star.</i>

1347
02:04:25,615 --> 02:04:28,618
Sergeant Major Choozoo
gave me re-up papers.

1348
02:04:28,868 --> 02:04:30,328
And you signed them?

1349
02:04:30,453 --> 02:04:33,456
<i>Yes, Gunney,
I'm a better Marine than I was a singer.</i>

1350
02:04:33,873 --> 02:04:36,626
<i>You're also a lot dumber
than I thought you were, too.</i>

1351
02:04:36,709 --> 02:04:37,960
What about you?

1352
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:43,049
<i>No, I've had it.
No room in this man's Corps for me now.</i>

1353
02:04:43,633 --> 02:04:45,593
<i>Besides, they've got you.</i>

1354
02:05:07,156 --> 02:05:11,160
I guess all of these marching bands
and parades are old stuff to you.

1355
02:05:12,286 --> 02:05:14,664
<i>To tell you the truth, this is the first time.</i>

1356
02:05:15,498 --> 02:05:18,000
There are my ladies.

1357
02:05:18,126 --> 02:05:20,253
<i>Gunney, duty calls.</i>
