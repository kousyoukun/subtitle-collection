- Yes, sir.

1526
01:57:04,161 --> 01:57:08,121
Then stick to it. You're a walking
clusterfuck as an infantry officer.

1527
01:57:08,321 --> 01:57:10,280
This is a Marine amphibious unit.

1528
01:57:10,441 --> 01:57:11,920
My men are hard-chargers.

1529
01:57:12,121 --> 01:57:14,760
Ring and Highway took a
handful of young fire-pissers...

1530
01:57:14,921 --> 01:57:17,879
...exercised some personal
initiative, and kicked ass!

1531
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:21,960
- Good work, lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir.

1532
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:24,719
See that some of those students
are escorted back to Cherry Point.

1533
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,119
Aye, aye, sir.

1534
01:57:27,961 --> 01:57:29,839
Well, you're dismissed.

1535
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:39,159
[ENGINE STARTS]

1536
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:54,118
What the hell are you two sorry-assed
individuals looking at? Get out of my LZ.

1537
01:57:55,479 --> 01:57:56,838
BOTH: Semper Fi.

1538
01:57:57,799 --> 01:57:59,399
Oorah.

1539
01:58:01,639 --> 01:58:05,638
Well, Chooz, I guess
we're not 0-1 -1 now, huh?
