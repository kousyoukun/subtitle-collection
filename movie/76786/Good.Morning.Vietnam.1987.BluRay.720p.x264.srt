59
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,290
我办不到 长官 你不明白的
I can't, sir. You don't understand.

60
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,880
希腊有个小岛上女人有如女神般
I've been on a Greek island with women who look like Zorba.

61
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,090
我以为再也找不到那样的小姐

她又出现了 她怎么到我们前面去了
There she is again. How did she get ahead of us?

65
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,100
那是另外一个人 长官
That's another person, sir.

66
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,940
她美丽又快速 加油门 试试她的体力
She's beautiful and quick. Speed up, check her stamina.

67
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,900
不可思议 噢 我的天 她们又快 又美又年轻
This is incredible. Oh, my God. They're quick, they're fast and small.

68
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,400
我觉得像是狐狸进了鸡窝了
I feel like a fox in a chicken coop.

69
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,200
我们来了一位新进人员

70
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,660
了解吗 迪克
Don't you understand, Dick?

71
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,370
不 长官 老实说 我不了解

72
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,540
请你把音调放低点 好吗
Would you kindly lower your tone, please?

73
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,420
是 长官 节目都是我在掌理的 将军
Yes, sir. I run this show, general.

74
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,800
如有差错的话 是我倒霉
If anything screws up, it's my ass in the mower.

75
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,300
如有任何变动应该通知我
I deserve to be notified of any changes that are made.

76
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,390
没有人和你争执
Nobody's arguing that with you.

77
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,060
我在克圭岛听过这小子的节目 他很风趣
Look, I caught his show on the Isle of Crete, and this guy is funny.

78
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,440
我差点笑死 军队 爱死他了
I damn near busted a gut laughing at him. And the troops, they love him.

79
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,900
这根本就是小题大作 无事生非
This is a tempest in a teacup. Much ado about nothing.

80
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,110
天呀 老兄 这不是脑部手术
For crying out loud, man, this isn't brain surgery.

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,910
别反应过度了 迪克 我们只是在谈一名该死的DJ而已
Don't get crazy over this, Dick. We're only talking about a damn deejay.

82
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,750
现在 在西贡 已没有"只有如此而已"的事了
There is no such thing as "only" anymore. Not now, not in Saigon.

83
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,670
史帝芬·哈克中尉是我们的直属长官
Lieutenant Steven Hauk is our immediate supervisor.

84
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,090
他有点古怪 但他人还不错
He's a little goofy, but he's okay.

85
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,050
迪克生士官长 哈 那则完全是另一回事
Sergeant Major Dickerson, ha, that's another story altogether.

86
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,800
他是精选特种部队的小队长
He was a commander of an elite special forces unit.

87
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,060
因神精质问题而调来这里...
He came to us because of prostrate problems...

88
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,930
某种社会影响性的问题无法解决
and some sort of social infection that doesn't go away.

89
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,480
外加 我认为他是屁股中弹 但我无法确认这件事
Plus, I think he got shot in the ass, but I can't confirm that.

90
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,230
总之 你最好不要去惹他
Anyway, he's the man that you don't want to aggravate.

91
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,860
你一向这么快乐吗
Are you always this happy?

92
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,570
- 康纳  - 长官
- Cronauer.  - Sir.

93
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,320
稍息 我是泰勒将军
At ease. I'm General Taylor.

94
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,620
- 你好 将军  - 幸会
- Hi, general.  - Real pleasure.

95
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,580
听着 你如果有问题的话只管来找我
Listen, if you have any problems here now, you come see me.

96
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,750
我是这里的最高长官
I'm the tallest hog in the trough around here.

97
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,330
- 加利 你又肥了吗  - 我想没有 长官
- Garlick, have you put on some weight?  - I don't think so, sir.

98
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,130
我的孩子 照你屁股的影子来看你好像重了二十磅
My son, the shadow of your ass would weigh 20 pounds.

99
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,050
我会努力 长官
I'll work on that, sir.

100
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,800
你不该对将军说你好
You're not supposed to address the general saying hi.

101
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,050
- 那又是新规定吗  - 不 老规定
- Is that a new rule?  - No, old rule.

102
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,810
- 里面那位就是哈克中尉  - 那个大耳朵的是谁
- That's Lieutenant Hauk in there.  - Who's the guy with the ears?

103
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,110
你好 他可以用那耳朵飞到关岛
How you doing? You could fly to Guam with those.

104
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,690
飞行员康纳 长官
Airman Cronauer, sir.

105
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,280
知道吗 偶而向我敬个礼不会害死你们的
You know, it wouldn't kill you people to salute me once in a while.

106
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,080
- 抱歉  - 谢谢
- Sorry.  - Thanks.

107
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,700
我知道你是位很风趣的DJ
I understand you're pretty funny as a deejay.

108
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,080
是的 嗯 说笑话是我的一种喜好
And, well, comedy is a kind of hobby of mine.

109
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,420
嗯 事实上 那不仅是一种喜好
Well, actually, it's a little more than just a hobby.

110
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,920
读者文摘考虑采用我的二则笑话
Reader's Digest is considering publishing two of my jokes.

111
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,550
- 真的  - 对
- Really?  - Yeah.

112
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,800
也许哪天晚上 我们可以...
And perhaps some night, we could maybe get together...

113
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,220
- 交换一下幽默的心得  - 好的
- and swap humourous stories for fun.  - Yeah.

114
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,930
有何不可 也许再放几张厄尼·福特的唱片
Why not? Maybe play a couple of Tennessee Ernie Ford records.

115
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,020
那才叫精采
That'd be a hoot.

116
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,730
- 那是笑话 对吧  - 也许是
- That's a joke, right?  - Maybe.

117
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,810
我听得出来
I get it.

118
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,530
这人的文件呢
Where's this man's paperwork?

119
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,660
- 在这里 士官长  - 谢谢 官长
- Right here, sergeant.  - Thank you, sir.

120
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,710
美国空军 由帽子上认出来的
United States Air Force. The hat does give you away.

121
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,800
这不是军中所发的衣服 这是那一种军服
This is not military issue, airman. What sort of uniform is that?

122
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,090
海岛服装
Cretan camouflage.

123
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,760
如果你想和一群希腊酒鬼打成一片 这个最适合
If you wanna blend into a crowd of drunken Greeks, there's nothing better.

124
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,640
那是幽默 我能认出来
That is humour. I recognise that.

125
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,560
我也认得出来你是位军人
I also recognise your species of soldier.

126
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,360
有次我在战场上也遇到位像你这样的人 他后来被炸成了碎片
I had a guy like you in the field one time. He blew himself to pieces.

127
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,530
在他还没幽默前 害死了三位好军人
But not before his humour cost the lives of three very fine individuals.

128
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,200
- 我希望...  - 你给我住嘴
- I hope...  - You shut your fucking hole.

129
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,450
你现在东南亚 你是在执行任务
You're in Southeast Asia now, pal. You got your cushy little assignment.

130
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,790
对这点我无能为力
There's nothing I can do about that.

131
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,830
到时候 你会使我忘了这件事
In time, you will make me forget it.

132
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,670
你别犯到我 就不会有问题
You stay out of my way, there'll be no problem.

133
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,340
但如你和我玩花样的话
But if you toy with me,

134
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,130
我会整到你希望在小孩时就死了
I'll burn you so bad you'll wish you died as a child.

135
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,930

是 迪克生士官长
Yes, Sergeant Major Dickerson.

140
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,570
他使我想起唐纳·里 尤其是眼睛那部份
He reminds me a lot of Donna Reed, especially around the eyes.

141
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,500
哈啰 哈啰 哈啰 这是你们的牧师 诺亚上尉
Hello, hello, hello. This is your chaplain, Captain Noel,

This great, godly miracle of radio really gives me the opportunity...

145
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,470
能在空中与你们讲话
to speak to you on the air.

146
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,430
长官 该起床了
Sir, it's time to rise.

147
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,470
天呀 这大麻真厉害 我还在飘
My God, it's Mardi gras, and I'm on the main float.

148
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,190
起床吧 长官 再过二周 就会习惯了
Come on, sir. In a couple of weeks, this'll be easy for you.

149
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,520
- 噢 让我再睡  - 该起床了 长官
- Oh, let me go back to bed.  - You gotta get up, sir.

- 老天 几点了 艾德华  - 5点半
- God, what time is it, Edward?  - It's 5:30.

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,570
5点半 这么早 再叫我要打你了
Five-thirty, it's very early. I may have to hurt you.

152
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,280
- 5分后叫我  - 不 你要马上起床
- Call me in five minutes.  - No, we have to get up right now.

153
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,160
你要去广播
And you have to get on the air.

154
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,120
- 拜托 长官  - 好吧
- Come on, sir.  - Fine.

155
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,790
就在走廊的尽头 对
It's just down the hall. Yeah.

156
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,460
- 你一定很紧张 长官  - 我甚至还没清醒
- You must be nervous, sir.  - I'm not even in my body.

157
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,880
放心 一切会很顺利 这边 长官
Don't worry, it'll go great. This way, sir.

158
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,780
离节目开始还有几分钟 长官
We still have a few minutes before your show begins, sir.

159
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,070
当要播新闻时 你就从机器上把它撕下来
When it's time to read the news, you just take it off these machines here.

160
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,030
但是对念的内容要注意 飞行员
But regardless of what you read, airman,

161
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,950
国防部要先过滤
the Department of Defence wants final say.

162
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,200
每条新闻都要经过这二位的检查
So every item's checked by these two guys in here.

163
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,040
二位 见见新DJ 艾德伦·康纳
Guys, I'd like you to meet our new deejay, Adrian Cronauer.

164
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,690
那是马帝·李·卓威兹
That's Marty Lee Dreiwitz.

165
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,400
他有洁癖
He's impeccably clean.

166
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,280
他用威斯康辛运来的清洁用品
This man has cleaning products shipped in from Wisconsin.

167
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,200
他也是你的室友 我是你的话 我会考虑去自杀
He's also one of your roommates, so if I were you, I'd think about suicide.

168
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,700
长官 我认为你别用那些唱片 长官
Sir, I really don't think that you wanna use any of those records, sir.

169
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,950
我们已挑选好了...
We have a selection right here that's prepared...

170
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,540
我一直期望见到你 能帮我个忙吗
I've been looking forward to meeting you. Listen, could you do me a favour?

171
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,540
能马上说笑话吗
Can you say something funny right this minute?

172
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,550
我怀疑
I doubt it.

173
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,420
我支持你 老兄 我和你同一频率
I'm with you, man. I'm on your frequency.

174
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,220
嗨 我问你一个问题 乔依·比许有什么专长
Hey, let me ask you a question. What is the appeal of Joey Bishop?

175
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,550
嗯 那人不风趣 我知什么是风趣可他不风趣
I mean, the man's not funny. I know funny and he's not funny.

176
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,600
别误会 他是好人
Don't get me wrong, he seems like a nice guy,

177
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,730
我父亲也是好人但他也不风趣
but my father's nice and he's not funny either.

178
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,230
乔依·比许 我真希望有人能说明一下
Joey Bishop. I wish someone would explain this one to me.

179
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,560
我说 你还有十秒就要上节目了
I incidentally, you're on the air in about ten seconds.

9 8 7 6...
Nine, eight, seven, six...

181
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,740
嗨 这是马帝·李的虚构与事实节目
Hey, this has been Fiction and Fact from Marty Lee's almanac.

182
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,700
现在直接从克利特岛来
And now direct from Crete,

183
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,870
欢迎飞行员艾德伦·康纳那平滑如丝绢般的声音
welcome the silky smooth sound of Airman Adrian Cronauer.

184
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,210
早安 越南
Good morning, Vietnam.

185
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,420
嗨 这不是试音 这是摇滚乐
Hey, this is not a test. This is rock 'n' roll.

186
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,260
由代尔它摇滚到DMZ
Time to rock it from the Delta to the DMZ.

187
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,640
像我的 还是像猫王的声音
Is that me, or does that sound like an Presley movie?

188
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,980
这么早是否太大声了 嗨 太迟了
Is it a little too early for being that loud? Hey, too late.

189
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,570
6点了 0代表什么 噢 我的天呀 好早呀
It's 0600. What's the O stand for? Oh, my God, it's early.

190
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,320
谈到早 克鲁马努人算早吗 马帝·卓威兹
Speaking of early, how about that Cro-Magnon, Marty Dreiwitz?

191
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,010
感谢你说我"平滑如丝绢般的声音" 使我的声音如派姬·李
Thank you for "silky smooth sound." Make me sound like Peggy Lee.

192
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,370
"早安 越南" 那是什么意思
"Good morning, Vietnam"? What the heck is that supposed to mean?

193
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,870
我不知道 中尉 我想就是早安 越南的意思
I don't know, lieutenant. I guess it means good morning, Vietnam.

194
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,710
谁允许他广播现代音乐的
And who gave anyone permission to program modern music?

195
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,130
佛烈帝和梦者
Freddie and the Dreamers.

196
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,800
转速错了 放错转速了
Wrong speed. We've got it on the wrong speed.

197
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,140
对那些由宿醉中醒来的人 这个声音最适合
For those of you recovering from a hangover, that's gonna sound just right.

198
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,480
转回去 试试快一点 这样才对
Let's pull her right back down. Let's try it faster, see if that picks it up.

199
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,140
试试17 18转...
Let's get it up on 17, 18...

200
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,730
那些家伙真赶 "我喜欢音乐 我喜欢音乐"
Those pilots are going,"I like the music, I like the music."

201
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,780
噢 仍旧不对 等等 试试这个
Oh, still a bad song. Hey, wait a minute. Let's try something.

202
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,240
我们倒着放看看会不会好一点
Let's play this backwards and see if it gets any better.

203
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,870
佛烈帝是魔鬼
Freddie is the devil.

204
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,120
想像一个人用...
Picture a man going on a journey...

205
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,330
影像和声音作旅行
beyond sight and sound.

206
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,830
他是左翼份子 他进入无武装区
He's left Crete. He's entered the demilitarised zone.

207
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,010
什么是无武装区
What is this demilitarised zone?

208
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,510
警方行动 是什么意思
What do they mean, police action?

209
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,800
听起来好像是布鲁克林的二名条子
Sounds like a couple of cops in Brooklyn,

210
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,220
"她看起来很美" 不论是什么 我喜欢...
"She looks pretty to me." Whatever it is, I like it...

211
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,350
因这要比用烈酒把你叫醒要好
because it gets you on your toes better than a strong cup of cappuccino.

212
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,650
什么是无武装区 好像是"绿野仙踪"中的话
What is a demilitarised zone? Sounds like something out of The Wizard of Oz.

213
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,730
噢 不 别进去
Oh, no, don't go in there.

214
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,570
胡志明...
Ho Chi Minh...

215
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,280
噢 看 你在西贡会学会的
Oh, look, you've landed in Saigon.

216
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,320
你现在身处于小人中了
You're among the little people now.

217
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,830
噢 不 沿着胡志明小径走
Oh, no, follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

218
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,040
噢 我会逮到你 小美人
Oh, I'll get you, my pretty.

219
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,500
天呀 是北方的鬼怪
It's the Wicked Witch of the North.

220
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,000
汉娜
It's Hanoi Hannah.

221
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,760
现在 小大兵 你和你的小岛
Now, little GI, you and your little Toto too.

222
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,140
噢 艾德伦 艾德伦 你在干什么 艾德伦
Oh, Adrian, Adrian. What are you doing, Adrian?

223
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,760
汉娜 你这烂货
Hannah, you slut.

224
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,520
你比铁达尼号还烂 马上停止
You've been down on everything but the Titanic. Stop it right now.

225
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,940
看 他真风趣 知道吗 他就像马克斯兄弟
You know, he's really funny. You know, he's like a Marx brother.

226
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,150
那会是哪个马克斯兄弟 下士 疯婆
And which Marx brother would that be, private? Zeppo?

227
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,200
- 我觉得他一点也不风趣  - 疯婆 是那戴帽子的女人
- I don't find him funny at all.  - Zeppo? Isn't he the one with the hat?

228
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,160
嗨 能帮我吗 你叫什么名字
Hey, hi, can you help me? What's your name?

内裤里更热
Hotter things is my shorts.

233
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,130
热到能在内裤里煮东西了 烤小鸟
I could cook things in it. Crotch-pot cooking.

234
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,210
- 能说说是何感受吗  - 笨蛋 我说过很热了
- Tell me what it feels like.  - Fool, it's hot.

就象看到个 穿桔红色睡袍的人 自己欲火焚身
I saw one of those guys, their orange robes, burst into flames.

238
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,560

- 你想今晚的情况会如何  - 又热又湿
- What's it gonna be like tonight?  - Hot and wet.

240
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,520
你是女的话还好 但身在丛林中就没有用了
That's nice if you're with a lady, ain't no good if you're in the jungle.

241
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,860
这有首歌献给你
Here's a song coming your way right now.

This is AFVN, rocking you from the Delta to the DMZ.

248
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,200
AFVN比AFVD好 那表示你要去打针了
AFVN better than AFVD, which means you have to get a quick shot.

249
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,790
我们继续进行
We're moving on right now.

250
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,960
有个谜语给你们猜
Here's a riddle for you.

251
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,880
童子军和军队有什么差别
What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts?

252
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,720
童子军没有大型炮兵
Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery.

253
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,110
嗨 我是艾德伦·康纳 16时再见
Hey, I'm Adrian Cronauer. I'm on again at 1600.

254
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,150
为什么 因为我必需是 军人呀
Why? Because I have to, it's the Army.

255
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,650
今天我们在战场中
Talking out in the field today.

256
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,740
- 嗨 你叫什么名字  - 我叫巴伯·佛利伯
- Hi, what's your name?  - Bob Fliber!

257
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,200
- 巴伯 你做什么的  - 我是炮兵
- Bob, what do you do?  - I'm in Artillery!

258
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,330
巴伯 要放什么歌吗
Bob, can we play anything for you?

259
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,250
随便 只要放大声的 好吗
Anything! Just play it loud, okay?

260
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,050
有些事我得向你坦白
I have to admit something to you.

261
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,510
我刚由希腊来那里女人如女神
I just came from Crete with women that look like Zorba.

262
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,220
谢谢你 那里...
Thank you. Those...

263
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,300
那里的女人好美
Those girls are just so pretty.

264
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,060
你在越南吗
Are you in Vietnam?

265
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,430
是 我在 意外呀 意外呀 意外呀
Yes, I am. Surprise, surprise, surprise.

266
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,940
你为何把你女儿取名为琳达·鸟
Why'd you name your daughter Linda Bird?

267
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,110
因为叫琳达·狗的话就太残忍了
Linda Dog would be too cruel.

268
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,610
汪 别紧张 女儿 别紧张
Arf! Easy, girl, easy.

269
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,230
如你抓他耳朵的话 比较不痛
Pick them up by their ears, it doesn't hurt them as much.

270
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,700
噢 这句话会使你下地狱
Oh, you're going to hell for that one.

271
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,240
这有个大巧合
Here's a coincidence:

272
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,870
胡志明 桑德士上校 是同一人吗
Ho Chi Minh, Colonel Sanders, actually the same person?

273
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,540
你来当裁判 线路是畅通的
You be the judge, our lines are open.

274
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,710
现在有胡志明小径的交通报告
We've got our traffic report up there on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

275
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,540
那边情况如何 艾德伦 情况不太好
How's it going up there? Adrian, it's not going exactly well.

276
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,840
有只水牛挡住路了
There's a water buffalo jackknifed up there.

277
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,380
画面不太美 到处都是号角声
It's not a very pretty picture. There's horns everywhere.

278
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,340
我不知道说什么了 丢了个炸弹过去吧...
I don't know what to say. We're gonna maybe drop in a little napalm...

279
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,510
把它给煮了 也许能来个烤肉会
and try and cook him down, maybe a little barbecue.

280
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,490
今天请到位贵宾来播音室 李欧先生
We've got a special man in the audience today, it's Mr.Leo.

281
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,330
他是军中时装顾问
He's a fashion consultant for the Army.

282
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,660
艾德伦 我很高兴来此
Adiran, I'm just very happy to be here.

283
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,000
我要告诉你一件事
I want to tell you something.

284
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,040
要知道 伪装这一套我实在不内行
You know, this whole camouflage thing for me doesn't work very well.

285
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,000
- 为何  - 嗯 看不见你
- Why is that?  - Well, I can't see you.

286
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,710
嗨 嗨 知道吗 这就像在铁笼里穿条子衣服
Heh, heh. You know, it's like wearing stripes and plaid.

287
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,670
对我来说 我想改变一下
For me, I want to do something different.

288
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,300
要去森林 就声明 如要去打仗 穿麻布袋
You go in the jungle, make a statement. If you're going to fight, clash.

289
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,310
明白吗
You know what I mean?

290
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,730
谢谢这美妙的音乐
Thank you for that lovely tune.

291
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,310
那热门乡村曲会陪我们到天明
That funky music will drive us till the dawn.

292
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,770
让我们跳舞到吐血为止
Let's go. Let's boogaloo till we puke.

293
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,280
艾德伦·康纳的时间快到了
That's it for the Adrian Cron-Hour.

294
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,360
我要去坐上驾驶座了
I'm gonna take myself out of the driver's seat,

295
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,990
我要转交给刺激先生
but I'm gonna turn you over right now to Mr.Excitement.

296
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,790
一位头发柔软 稀疏 但个性火爆的人
A man with limp, damaged hair, but nevertheless a fireball.

297
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,460
丹·拉文登
Dan Levitan.

298
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:57,420
这是西贡 AFRS电台 我是"最真实的"主持人 丹·拉文登
This is AFRS, Radio Saigon, and yours truly, Dan "The Man" Levitan.

299
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,300
向越南地区所有官员问好致敬...
Greetings and salutations to any and all servicemen in the area...

300
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,720
谢谢各位收听本台的节目
and thanks so much for joining us.

301
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,850
- 好  - 女士们先生们
- All right!  - Ladies and gentlemen!

302
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,520
嗯 他很风趣 我知道这小子很风趣
Yeah, he's funny. I know funny and this guy is funny.

303
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,520
非常好
Sensational.

304
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,320
- 稍息  - Hell 我们已经是了
- At ease.  - Hell, we already are.

305
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,820
少耍嘴皮子 飞行员
Just cool your tongue, airman,

306
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,410
因为我要讨论一下你的节目
because I intend to take issue with your performance.

307
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,120
首先 别开天气的玩笑
First of all, don't make fun of the weather here.

308
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,790
别说这里的天气都是一样的
And don't say that the weather is the same all the time here,

309
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,040
因为不是这样的
because it's not.

310
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,380
事实上 今天比昨天要低二度
I n fact, it's 2 degrees cooler today than yesterday.

311
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,210
低二度 我竟没穿皮大衣 老天
Two degrees cooler? Me without my muff, God.

312
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,630
- 我说过 这个人很风趣  - 我正在主持会议
- I tell you, this guy's funny.  - I'm trying to run a meeting here.

313
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,810
知道吗 我憎恨你们这些人从不对我敬礼
You know, I hate the fact that you people never salute me.

314
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,850
我是个中尉有时喜欢敬个礼
I am a lieutenant and I would like salutes occasionally.

315
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,900
军衔比较高就是这么回事
That's what being a higher rank is all about.

316
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,230
第二...
Second...

317
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,070
- 节目口味  - 节目口味
- Programming taste.  - Programming taste.

318
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,620
老实说 我觉得你的"我爱警方行动"有点太离谱了
Frankly, I found your "I love a police action" remark way out of line.

319
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,700
你怎能把越南的冲突...
How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in Vietnam...

320
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,250
和一杯咖啡并论呢
with a glass of cappuccino coffee?

321
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,250
嗯 我是... 就这样想出来 我只想风趣一下
Well, I was... It just comes up, I was just trying to be funny.

322
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,670
- 风趣很好  - 是的
- Funny is good.  - Yeah.

323
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,210
风趣很好
Funny is good.

324
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,090
但那是用在喜剧和幽默上的
But then do it by using comedy and humour.

325
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,970
不是用在警方行动和咖啡上
Not police action and coffee remarks.

326
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,140
更严重的是 你应该播放正常的音乐
Furthermore, you are to stick to playing normal modes of music.

327
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,010
而不是狂野的东西
Not wild stuff.

328
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,100
在这里能接受的...
Those we would find acceptable here...

329
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,100
包括劳伦斯·华克 吉母·纳伯 蒙特瓦尼
would include Lawrence Welk, Jim Nabors, Mantovani.

330
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,310
伯西·费斯
Percy Faith.

331
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,570
- 伯西·费斯 很好  - 谢谢
- Percy Faith, good.  - Thank you.

332
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,740
安迪·威廉 派瑞·科摩和法兰克·辛纳屈的一些曲子
Andy Williams, Perry Como and certain ballads by Mr.Frank Sinatra.

333
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,030
- 巴伯·迪伦也不行吗  - 绝 绝 绝对不行
- Would Bob Dylan be out of line?  - Way, way, way out of line.

334
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,160
前任副总统尼克森本周会来
Former VP Richard Nixon will arrive here this week.

335
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,210
卓威兹 我指派你负责PC
Dreiwitz, I've assigned you to cover the PC.

336
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,460
他喜欢把记者招待会说成PC
He likes to say PC instead of press conference.

337
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,710
- 中尉喜欢缩略语...  - 如果你...
- The lieutenant loves to abbreviate...  - And if you do...

338
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,760
如果你正好和他说话的话
And if you do happen to speak with him,

339
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,340
请随时都要注意礼貌
please be polite and to the point at all times.

340
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,720
一定 长官
Affirmative, sir.

341
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,520
一定 长官 好
Affirmative, sir. Good.

342
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,100
好 11月来劳军的是谁
Okay. Who do we have slated for live entertainment in November?

343
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,480
嗯 我们本来希望是鲍伯·贺伯 但是他不能来
Well, we originally wanted Bob Hope, but turns out he won't come.

344
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,530
- 为什么不能来  - 他不扮演警方行动 只有战争
- Why not?  - He doesn't play police actions, just wars.

345
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,820
鲍伯喜欢大空间 长官
Bob likes a big room, sir.

346
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,290
- 这不好笑  - 扩大如何
- That is not funny.  - How about if it escalated?

347
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,760
- 什么扩大如何  - 越南的冲突
- How about if what escalated?  - The Vietnam conflict.

348
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,800
越南的冲突
The Vietnam conflict?

349
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,260
我们不会为了要一位大牌的明星...
We are not going to escalate a whole war...

350
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,890
而将战争扩大
just so we can book a big-name comedian.

351
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,520
我们可以找汤尼·班奈或者崔尼·罗佩斯
We can get Tony Bennett or Trini Lopez.

352
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,400
我想到了 杰瑞 他18号结束表演
I got it. Jerry Vale. He closes the Copa on the 18th.

353
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,440
- 那日期确定吗  - 我姪女告诉我的
- Is that date firm?  - I got it from my niece.

354
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,110
拜托 这不是三脚猫的把戏
Come on, this is not the Catskills.

355
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,570
- 找谁好呢 海滩男孩吧  - 别胡来了
- Get somebody good, The Beach Boys.  - Don't dick around.

356
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,070
我们试过了 但经纪人说他们还在沙滩上...
We tried, but their agent says they're still on the beach...

357
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,120
要到11月才有空
and they won't be off the sand till November.

358
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,790
嗯 是不是有人穿了我的制服...
Well, didn't somebody wearing my uniform...

359
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,120
配上我的阶级代表我个人...
and bearing a striking resemblance to myself...

360
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,080
而说这种音乐不适当吗
just say that that kind of music was inappropriate?

361
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,710
抱歉 长官 我还没有睡觉
Sorry, sir. I haven't been to sleep.

362
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,300
前任副总统周五来此
The former VP will be here on Friday.

363
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,760
我期望副总统的记者招待会...
I expect every minute of the VP's PC...

364
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,970
将在他到达后12小时内播出
to be taped and broadcast within 12 hours of his arrival.

365
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,470
有什么好笑的吗 加利
Something funny, Garlick?

366
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,970
也许你能和大家分享一下
Perhaps you'd like to share it with the rest of us.

367
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,020
不 长官 前任副总统令人兴奋 长官
No, sir. The former vice president is a delight, sir.

368
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,520
对不起 长官
Excuse me, sir.

369
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,860
既然VP是VIP
Seeing as how the VP is such a VIP,

370
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,820
我们就不该将PC的事QT 因为如果泄露给VC
shouldn't we keep the PC on the q.t., because if it leaks to the VC,

371
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,240
就会变成MIA 那时我们就会变成KP
he could end up an MIA, and then we'd all be put on KP.

372
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,920
- 我要走了  - 噢 是 长官
- I would like to leave the room now.  - Oh, yes, sir.

373
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,390
噢 一个花花公子
Oh, what a dude.

374
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,560
如果你是的话...
And if you do...

375
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,980
如果你是的话...
And if you do...

376
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:27,730

I call it a jubilee. Actually, it's a Ray Conniff featurette.

This is the place where we like to hang out, sir.

381
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,690
很热闹 有点鸦片馆的样子
Real homey, in an opium kind of way.

382
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,650
- 厄尔 厄尔 厄尔  - 吉米 他是老板
- Earl, Earl, Earl.  - That's Jimmy Wah, he owns the place.

现在该你对我说你好 然后微笑
Now you say hi to me, then you smile.

386
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,130
- 我们为何叫做厄尔  - 大家都是厄尔
- Either of our names Earl?  - He calls everybody Earl.

387
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,170
吉米是不是有点娘娘腔
Is it me or is Jimmy light in the loafers?

388
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,390
我这样说好了 他听说了华特·布里门的事
Let me put it to you this way. He's got this thing for Walter Brennan.

389
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,390
他试图想买他的裸体照片
He says he wants to buy naked photographs of the actor.

390
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,270

- For three years, he's been trying.  - Walter Brennan?

391
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,850
你知道 华特·布里门参演的电视剧"真正的麦考"吗
You know, Walter Brennan from The Real McCoys, the TV show?

392
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,570
总之 第一团 第二步兵连有个人
Anyway, there's this guy from the 1 st Battalion, 2nd I nfantry,

393
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,070
他发誓能找到他的裸体照
who swore that he could get him naked photographs of the actor.

394
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,950
我一直告诉他那是办不到的 但他不肯听
I've been trying to tell him that it's no-go, but he won't listen.

395
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,030

华特·布里门的事有进展了吗
Any movement on the Walter Brennan thing?

399
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,920
- 没有 远景也不太好 吉米  - 我觉得他远景很好
- No, and it doesn't look good, Jimmy.  - He looks good to me.

400
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,300

402
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,430

甲醛
Formaldehyde.

404
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,610
我们为了香味而放了点甲醛
We put in just a touch of formaldehyde for flavour.

405
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,400
有的人会不舒服
Some people get sick, yeah.

406
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,860
如你要紧急送医的话

407
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,320

418
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,720
我请你喝杯咖啡补偿你吧
Let me make it up to you by buying a cup of coffee.

419
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,600

I'm... She's getting away. Edward, get the jeep, get the jeep.

424
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,370

Okay. It's blocked in by a truck.

- 自行车 我们买自行车吧  - 我们不买自行车
- Bikes, we'll buy bikes.  - We won't buy bikes.

427

这些轮胎上没有橡皮轮圈
There's actually no rubber on these tyres.

噢 真挑剔 走吧 艾德华 是的 大追逐
Oh, picky, picky. Let's go, Edward. Yeah, the chase.

429
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,060
长官 长官 我们要表现得有点尊严
Sir! Sir, we have to get some dignity here.

430
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,930
有点尊严
A little dignity!

431
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,730
长官 长官 我告诉你 这不安全
Sir! Sir, I tell you, this is not safe!

Sir!

433
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,950
长官 长官
Sir, sir!

Last time, in our last class, we read Chapter 3.

436
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,590
你说接受过自行车训练的 伙计
Should've gotten the one with the training wheels, pal.

437
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,220
我几乎被压死
I was almost killed.

438
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,140
卡车的保险杆离我鼻子只这么近
A truck's bumper was this far from my nose.

439
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,770
我的一生在眼前经过 并且一点也不精采
My whole life passed before my eyes, and it wasn't even interesting to me.

440
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,730
我要如何能认识这女孩
How am I gonna get to first base with this girl?

441

我想买些黄油和奶酪 谢谢
I want to buy some butter and some cheese, please.

442
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,070
全投射了 俗话说的好
It zoomed right by, just the way they say it does.

443
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,950
集邮 帮忙父亲做农务

Arranging rakes by sizes for my mom in the garage.

445
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,370
即使是回顾二秒钟 我的一生很无趣
Even encapsulated in two seconds, my life is dull.

446
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,790
- 我认为很危险  - 艾德华 帮我这件事
- I find that very alarming.  - Edward, stay with me on this.

447
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,880
要如何做才能使这女孩和我出去
How am I gonna get this girl to go out with me?

448
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,090
你不行 文化非常不同
You're not. This is a very different culture.

449
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,800
你需要非常明确 正式的介绍...
You would need very specific family-sanctioned introductions...

- 才能和这女孩交谈...  - 听

我从未听过这种美曲
I've never heard rhymes like that.

452
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,230
天哪 我一定要与她在一起 至少要让她记住我的名字
God, I've gotta be with her, at least till she learns my name.

453
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,190
你觉得教书的能和她约会吗
You think the teacher would be able to date her?

454
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,860

是的 我只剩2个月好活了 想在死前教教书
Yes, I have two months to live and I would like to teach before I die.

462
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,020
我想你不太了解我 聪明小子 啊咳
I don't think you understand me, Sparky. Ahem.

463
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,560
全是你的了 开始吧
It's all yours, you got it.

464
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,980
你们好 同学们 我叫艾德伦·康纳
Hello, class. My name is Adrian Cronauer.

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,360
为了让我能认识你们...
And I'd like to get to know all of you...

466
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,450
我要你们把名字 地址
by having you write down your name, address,

467
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,200
家和工作地点的电话写在纸上 向前传
your home and work phone on paper, and passing it forward.

468
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,120
史隆士官长是我们的老师 你不该在这
Sergeant Sloan our teacher. You're not supposed to be in here.

469
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,620
我是上校派来的
I was sent here on very strict orders from a colonel.

470
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,130
首先我想知道这是在教什么
First thing I'd like to know is what subject this is.

471
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,590
- 是否是英文  - 是的 没错
- Is it English?  - Yes, it is.

472
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,550
我真幸运 谢谢你的指教
And how lucky for me. Thank you very much for playing.

473
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,930
现在 英文是一种很奇妙的语言
Now, let's start off with the fact that English is a fantastic language.

474
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,220
让我们试试这个句子 嗯 我想说
Let's try a little phrase, uh, I like to call:

475
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,390
"我男友回来了会有麻烦
"My boyfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble.

476
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,400
嗨 嗨 我男友回来了" 能试试这个吗
Hey, nah, hey, nah, my boyfriend's back." Can we try that one?

477
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,860
能试试 "我男友回来了吗" 哪个来
Can we try,"My boyfriend's back"? Anybody?

478
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,110
她不适合你
She's not for you.

479
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,110
为何我觉得像是奇迹创造者
Why do I feel like the miracle worker up here?

480
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,540
- 这是场恶梦  - 我不知道
- This is a nightmare.  - I don't know.

481
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,500
甚至说我不认识迪克
Even saying that means I don't know dick.

482
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,960
我真的不能教英语
I can't really teach English.

483
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,790
他回来后才可以打电话
Didn't have to pick up the phones until he comes back.

484
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,470
我只能告诉你们在美国一般的说法
I can only tell you about how you can talk on maybe the real streets of America.

485
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,340
你在纽约的街上有人对你说
If you're walking on the streets of New York and someone says,

486
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,930
"嗨 对不起
"Hey, excuse me.

487
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,970
我想买些乳酪和牛油"
I would like to buy some cheese and some butter."

488
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,100
不 不 得了吧
No. No, come on.

489
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,230
基本上 我们这样说 "嗨 老兄 好吗
Basically, we talk, "Hey, man, what's happening?

490
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,810
你看来很正点 给我点皮"
You look hip today. Slip me some skin."

491
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,610
当美国人说
If someone in America comes up and says,

492
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,320
"给我点皮时" 不要怕
"Slip me some skin," don't be afraid.

493
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,320
他们不是麻疯病人 它们不会
They're not a leper, they're not gonna go:

494
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,950
不 那是说 "嗨 宝贝 给我点皮"
No, it means like, "Hey, baby, slip me some skin."

495
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,160
这是句问候语 就如 "你好吗 很高兴见到你 给我点皮"
It's a greeting. It's like, "How are you doing? Nice to meet you. Slip me some skin."

496
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,160
你要这么做 你说 "给我点皮" 手放上去
Here's how you do it, "Slip me some skin." Put your hand out there.

497
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,160
然后你就说 "是 那就是一点皮" 你也这样对我
Then you go. "Yeah, there's some skin." Now you do it to me.

498
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,290
对 现在 然后你说 "好棒"
Yeah, now, then you say, "Groovy, yeah."

499
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,670

很美好的事 就说好棒

I'm interested in the girl, not in you playing "Dear Abby."

You come into my class, so maybe we like you.

你是为女孩而来 得到她 你就离去
You come for the girl, you get her, you go.

- Come on, come on.  - You like me because of my sister.

527
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,080
不是 我是因你诚实才喜欢你 因你比我矮
No, I like you because you're honest. Because you're shorter than I am.

528
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,210
我们看起来像一个前后的照片 来吧 我请你喝酒
We look like a before and after picture. Come on, let me buy you a beer.

Sometimes your face look like a fish in the Gulf of Thailand.

That's true, it's very true. That's an insult, isn't it?

我了解美国人
I know Americans.

533
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:02,350
他们见到喜欢的胸部就用大车子载她
You see a girl with the type breasts they like and they put her in a fancy car,

534
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,140
请她吃很贵的食物 对钱的事说谎
and they buy her some expensive food, and then lie about money.

535
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,850
试图带她上床
And then try and take her into a bed.

536
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,320
- 这 这有什么不好  - 这里较诚心
- So, what's wrong with that?  - It's more devout here.

537

Who the hell gets laid as a young child? And stop calling them gals.

592
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,040
在瑞士的犹太科学家设计的

593
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,250
凡都区博士
Dr. Heimlich Feintush.

594
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,420
我们一直想认识他们 但想不出好的开场白
We're trying to meet them, but nobody can come up with any good lines.

595
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,470
等等 试试这个 试试这个
Wait a minute, try this one, try this one.

我说 我们不该和这种女孩胡来的
Say, we're not supposed to fraternise with these girls.

602
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,440

拉文登 知道我的名字了吗
My name is Levitan. Can you say that?

616
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,560
谁带你来这的

you have to kick out the Chinks, spics, spooks and kikes,

625
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,500
最后会只剩下一群脑残的乡下人
and all that's gonna be left in here are a couple of brain-dead rednecks,

626
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,040
那会有什么好玩的
and what fun would that be?

627
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,870
这下他们无言相对了
Now is when I stop talking.

628
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,340
拜托 我请你们喝酒 怎么样
Come on, let me buy you a couple of beers. How about it?

629
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,630
- 你疯了吗  - 也许...
- Are you crazy?  - I might...

630
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,840
- 住嘴  - 好

631
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,630
把他赶走
Get him out of here.

632
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,510

嗨 嗨 嗨 别这样子
Hey, hey, hey, come on now.

634
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,010
你想证明什么 为何要赶越南小孩
You gotta prove something, knocking around Vietnamese kids?

635
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,720
这里是美国大兵的酒吧 我们不喜欢越南佬 不想他们在这
This is a GI bar. We don't like gooks. We don't want him here.

636
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,850
你带他出去
You just get him out.

637
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,400
大家都在说"越南佬" 但是这没关系
Everybody say "gook," but it's all right.

638
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,110
- 一起来 好吗  - 我们支持你
- Jump in any time, okay?  - We're there.

639
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,280
我要告诉你一件事 知道吗
I gotta tell you something, you know.

640
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,110
我到过世界各地 见过很多地方的很多人
I've been all around the world, seen a lot of places and a lot of people.

641
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,570
我从未见过像你如此巨大的...
I have never ever, in my travels, come across a man as large as you...

642
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:15,830
拥有这种肌肉的 完全没有命根子的人
with as much muscles, who has absolutely no penis.

643
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,040
他的意思是夸奖
He mean that as compliment.

644
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,790
噢 该死的
Oh, shit.

645
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,590
这最适合你 混蛋
That's it for you, asshole.

646
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,130
报警 快
Call police, quick.

647
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,800
- 嗨 嗨 老兄 嗨  - 揍他
- Hey, hey, man, hey!  - Get him.

648
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,230
说
Talk.

649
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,690
这二人在侮辱越南政府
These two were physically abusing a Vietnamese national.

650
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,310
- 我起身辩护...  - 你就开始打架
- I thought since we were here to...  - So you start a brawl.

651
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,980
把那地方全毁了 真高明的方法
Turn the place upside down. Real intelligent solution.

652
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,280
你可知这使我多难堪...
Do you have any idea how ridiculous it makes me look...

653
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,780
我指挥下的人竟然在酒吧里打群架
to have a man under my command start a fucking bar brawl?

654
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,960
- 你在这里待不久 老兄  - 你可以调我回克里特岛
- You're not gonna last long here, pal.  - You can always send me back to Crete.

655
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,090
噢 你把这当作笑话
Oh, you think this is a joke?

656
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,260
我可以安排你到别的地方去
I can come up with alternatives other than Crete.

657
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,760
我对这种事很内行
I'm real good at stuff like that.

658
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,220
我调过的人到至今想不出脱身方法
I got people stuck in places they haven't even considered how to get out of yet.

659
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,640
你以为我想不出好主意
You don't think I can come up with something good?

660
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,060
你想像的出很悲惨的选择吗
Can you envision some fairly unattractive alternatives?

661
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,440
没有提示不行
Not without slides.

662
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,440
酒吧群架 就是其中之一 康纳
A bar brawl, that's one, Cronauer.

663
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,700
你最好安份点 你最好别再参予任何事
You better stay cool. You better not get involved in anything.

664
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,070
你最好别再出事
You better not even come within range of anything that happens,

665
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,620
否则你的屁股就是草 我是叉子
or your ass is grass and I'm a lawnmower.

666
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,500
- 我说的够清楚了吗  - 是的 长官
- Am I being fairly clear?  - Yes, sir.

667
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,420
长官 你看到这制服上的军衔了吗
Sir? Do you see anything on this uniform indicating an officer?

668
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,750
三上三下是什么意思
What does three up and three down mean to you, airman?

669
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,840
发展到极限
End of an inning.

670
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,550
士官长
Sergeant major.

671
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,180
现在你马上给我滚出去
Now, you get the hell out of here right now.

672
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,860
拜托 够了
Jesus, enough.

673
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,200
拜托 我会... 回击
Please, I'm... Bag it!

674
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,740
醒来 贪睡虫 你迟到了
Wake up, Mr.Sleepy Head. You are late.

675
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,970

Gentlemen, what can I say but hi.

676

噢 检查 检查 检查
Oh, censor, censor, censor.

679
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,100
加入军中就是来画圈圈
Join the Army and mark things.

680
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,560
嗨 你留给我什么新闻

"英国承认了新加坡岛国"
"Great Britain recognised the island state of Singapore."

692
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,410
你要如何去承认一个岛
How do you recognise an island?

693
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,580
去你的 "嗨 等等 不 别告诉我 等等

"密西西比小姐今天突破了女同性恋者的保护"
"The Mississippi River broke through a protective dike today."

701

什么是女同性恋者的保护
What is a protective dike?

702
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,100
那是一位巨大的女人站在河边说

"别走近那边"

00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,310
别走近那边 离河远一点 走开
Don't go near there. Get away from the river, stay away.

705

我知道不能用"女同性恋者"这个字 你甚至不能说"女同志"
I know we can't use "dyke. "You can't even say "lesbian."

706
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,150

我们只有找别人了
We'll go to someone else for the weather.

714
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,880
我想只有直接找华府中央气象局找华特·康凯
We have to go to Washington to Weather Central to Walter Cronkite.

715
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,380
华特 气候如何

716
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,590
我只想对罗斯福先生说
I want to begin by saying to Roosevelt E. Roosevelt,

717
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,720
过去如此 现在如此 今后也是如此
what it is, what it shall be, what it was.

明天有可能...
Tomorrow a chance of continued crappy...

721
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,810
因为北方的影响而变得很糟糕
with a pissy weather front coming down from the north.

722
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,570
基本上 会更热更狗屁
Basically, it's hotter than a snake's ass in a waggon round up.

723
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,150
我们现在为你们播放些歌曲
We're gonna hit some songs at you now.

724
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,950
用自己的方式
Coming your way.

725
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,950
这是什么 烂天气 狗屁天气
What the hell was that? Crappy weather, shitty weather?

726
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,660
- 笑话 长官  - 笑话

不 不 这不是笑话 笑话是好笑的
No, no. This is not comedy. Comedy is fun.

728
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,250
- 是滑稽 歇斯底里  - 是神经质  - 是歇斯底里神经质
- It's antics, hysterical  - type things.  - Hysterical-type things?

729

神经质的事你最专长
Airman Cronauer requesting you to elaborate.

730

滑稽 妈的 笑话是 就比如笨警察跌倒的事
Antics, damn it. Comedy of errors, like the Keystone Kops falling down.

- 大家喜欢这个  - 跌倒 是动作
- General wackiness like that.  - Falling down, that's a sight gag.

732
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,180
- 无线电中怎么看得见  - 不 不 不 不是真的跌倒
- How would anyone see you fall?  - No, no, no. Not literally falling down.

733

- 那在无线电中行不通 长官  - 你瞧 长官
- Wouldn't work on radio, sir.  - See, sir?

734
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:30,810
我是指那种精神
What I mean is in the spirit of the Keystone Kops.

735
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,480
行不通 长官 我不这么认为
Sir, it wouldn't work, I don't think.

736
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,690
我想没有人会听到你跌倒的声音 长官
I don't think anybody would see you fall through a radio, sir.

737
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,530
在无线电中...
If a field radio...

738
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,780
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

743
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,870

谢谢你这种建设性的批评
Thank you for that constructive criticism.

745
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,210
能得到仰慕者的评语是种荣幸
It's a privilege to take comedy notes from a man of your stature.

746
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,630

别让这种事再发生
Just don't let it happen again.

748
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,640
在字典中 "屁眼"一字中的说明 写道 "看他"
In the dictionary, under "asshole," it says,"See him."

749
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,230

Why am I here?

750

Shit.

770
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,020
如有人使你越来越生气

If you say that, hey, some people in a car, some gypsies, they cut you off.

775
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,110
突然间你...
All of a sudden you...

776
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,910
- 给他一记  - 一记

777
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,870
很好 假如 现在有个特殊情况
Very good. Okay, now we got a special situation right now.

778
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,380
有位波多黎各女侍

噢 她失手了 她失手把汤倒在你新裤子上...
Oh, she slips, she spills it on your brand-new gabardine pants...

781
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,880
那裤子比电视机还贵
that you paid more than a coloured TV for.

782
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,140
你有点生气 你对她说...
You're a little angry, so you say to her...

不 不 你看 你是胡说 满口胡说
No, no, you see, you step in shit, you can be full of crap.

789
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,240
你可以胡说 有次我在法国电影中看到
I'm pretty sure you can step on crap. I once saw it in a French movie.

790
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,030
一个人怎能看起来像粪

他们不会批准这个发布
They'd never approve of that being released.

That's right, the big Dick is here. Get ready.

907
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,840
我认为这是很不寻常的巧合
I think there's an incredible coincidence here.

908
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,130
我认为他的声音很像艾德先生 你来判断
I think he sounds exactly like Mister Ed. You be the judge.

909

不可思议的巧合 再来一些歌
An incredible coincidence, some more songs.

912
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:35,390
持续到天明 和天明精灵 是的

你能从那里打电话来
Where am I gonna take requests? Where can you call from?

00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,040
对 我在DMZ的电话亭 我现在就打电话给你
I'm in a phone booth out in the DMZ. I'm trying to call you right now.

Lock 'n' loll, baby. Lock 'n' loll.

917

接下去 这里有位来自军方情报处的朋友
Again, we've got our friend from military intelligence.

918
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:28,240
你能告诉我们从你来这里之后 你对敌人有何发现
Can you tell us what you've found out about the enemy since you've been here?

919
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,700
我们发现我们找不到他们 他们在外面
We found out that we can't find them. They're out there,

920
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:37,620
我们在找寻敌人方面非常的困难
and we're having a major difficulty in finding the enemy.

921
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,250
嗯 你是利用什么去找他们
Well, what do you use to look for them?

922
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,880
嗯 我们询问人民 "你是敌人吗"
Well, we ask people,"Are you the enemy?"

923
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,050
只要说是的人 我们就开枪打他
And whoever says yes, we shoot them.

924
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:54,680
很不容易找到叫查理的越南人
It's very difficult to find a Vietnamese man named Charlie.

925
00:55:54,850 --> 00:56:00,480
他们全叫诺南或者道诸如此类的 对我来说很困难
They're all named Nyugen or Doh or things like that. It's very difficult for me.

926
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,940
谢谢 是否属实
Thank you. Is it true that you've actually... ?

927
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:10,070
你真的离他们在实验的神经气体太近了
You're actually too close to some of the nerve agents they were testing?

928
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,900
神经毒气
Nerve gas?

929
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,910
是 你是否用过
Yes, have you used any?

930
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,910
嗯 一次 是的 对我自己 但没有...
Well, once, yes, on myself. And it had no...

931
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,910
对我没有奏效
No effect on me.

932
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,540
我说没有实际的...
I've had no actual...

933
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,920
哇 大狗 大狗帖在我脸上
Whoa, big dogs. Big dogs landing on my face.

934
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,670
我不知那是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

935
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,970
嘿 时间到了 艾德伦·康纳时间到了
Hey, that's it for me. That's the end of the Adrian Cron-Hour,

936
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:39,470
我现在交给丹·拉文登先生
but I'm gonna turn you over right now to Mr.Warmth, Dan "The Tan" Levitan.

937
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,390
哈 哈 非常感谢 艾德伦
Ha, ha. Thank you so much, Adrian.

938
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,190
艾德伦·康纳是本台 深受官兵喜爱的疯狂主持人...
Adrian Cronauer, Gls, a wacky and welcome addition...

939
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,110
尼克森的记者招待会
Nixon's press conference.

940
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:51,110
嗯 你听听看 他几乎快要真诚了
Well, wait till you hear it. He's this far from sincerity.

941
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,110
噢 不 朋友 听着 我去填点东西
Oh, no, man, listen. Let me just feed my face.

942
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,820
就一会 拜托
Just a moment, come on.

943
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:02,120
- 你要去那里  - 去吃点东西
- Where do you imagine you're going?  - Just gonna get a little something to eat.

944
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,370
你没有时间
You don't have time.

945
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,870
你在这里吃速食面吧
You'll stay here and drink instant beverage or something.

946
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,130
我们答应听众在下午4点时倾听尼克森的谈话
We promised our listening audience Nixon highlights by 4 p. m.

947
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,460
我已广播了4小时 有点饿了
I've been on the air for four hours. I'm hungry.

948
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,380
那是笑语 对不 我明白了
That's a joke, right? I get it.

949
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,640
不 我真的饿了
No, I'm actually hungry.

950
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,390
嗯 我真的命令你
Well, I'm actually giving you an order.

951
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:27,560
噢 是命令 这样的话 先生 策划吧
Oh, it's an order. In that case, gentlemen, let's edit.

952
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,610
谢谢
Thank you.

953
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,610
坎贝尔的面
Campbell's.

954
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,910
厄尔 噢 又是你 不再打架了 好吗
Earl, oh, you again. No more fighting, okay?

955
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,620
噢 你换衣服了 詹母士 不错 发亮的绿西装
Oh, you got it. James, nice, shiny green suit.

956
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,290
你看来像人妖
You look like an Oriental leprechaun.

957
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:50,590
你喜欢吗 我由香港弄来的 发亮绿西装之家
You like it? I got it in Hong Kong, home of the shiny green suit.

958
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,590
所以南越没中立的空间...
There is no place for neutrality...

959
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,760
也没有中立的妥协
or a neutralist sentiment in South Vietnam.

960
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:01,260
我在今日离开越南的同时 在我脑海中毫无疑问的...
As I leave Vietnam today there is no doubt, certainly, in my mind...

961
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,470
嗨 是尼克松
Hey. That's Nixon.

962
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,100
越共将会被击败
Whether the Vietcong will be defeated,

963
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,900
这场战争也会打赢
And that this war will be won.

964
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,190
这个题目尚包括了... 我觉得非常适当
Mission does involve... I think very appropriately.

965
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,940
正如你所建议的 赋予与夺取
As you have suggested, give and take.

966
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,940
嗯 我其实没有作此建议 长官 对不起
Well, I didn't make that suggestion, sir. I'm sorry.

967
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:18,490
美国政府没有权力赋予
The United States has no right to give.

968
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,120
康纳的声音为何出现在录音带中
Why would Cronauer's voice be on this tape?

969
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,410
不知道 中尉
I don't know, lieutenant.

970
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,120
领土上的共产党
Territory to the Communists.

971
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:26,710
谢谢你这番政治性发言
Thank you for that concise political commentary,

972
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,290
但我想谈一些较私人的话题...
but I'd like to delve into something slightly more personal...

973
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,670
为了那些在战场上的弟兄
for the men in the field.

974
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,750
你会如何形容你的生殖器
How would you describe your testicles?

975
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,550
软软的 浅薄的...
They're soft, they're shallow...

976
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,380
- 没有目的的  - 噢 我的天呀
- and they have no purpose.  - Oh, my God.

977
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,220
- 你是在说什么 长官  - 噢 我的天
- What, sir?  - Oh, my God.

978
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,390
它缺少体能上的冲劲
They lack the physical strength.

979
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,310
你会如何形容你的性生活 帕特
How would you describe your sex life with your wife, Pat?

980
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,390
有时候不太刺激
It is unexciting sometimes.

981
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,350
你是否考虑过变性
Have you considered a sex change?

982
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,690
通过一个手术...
There is an operation that...

983
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,850
求求你 别这样对待我 求求你
Please don't do this to me. Please don't do this.

984
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,690
一个非常雄性的吉娃娃
A very well-hung Chihuahua.

985
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,150
尼克森先生 既然你来到越南 谣传你抽大麻
Mr.Nixon, while you've been in Vietnam, it's rumoured that you smoked marijuana.

986
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,780
你计划带些大麻回美国的家中吗
Are you planning, sir, to take some of the marijuana back to the United States?

987
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,030
你要如何办到
How would you do that?

988
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,160
用飞机 直升机同时还用汽车
By plane, by helicopter and also by automobile.

989
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:09,160
我想知道你是否能那么对艾德先生 因为...
I was wondering if you could do your Mister Ed, because...

990
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:12,790
关掉 我说关掉
Cut that thing off. I said cut it off.

991
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,380
长官
Sir.

992
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,840
- 康纳呢  - 还在吃饭 长官
- Where is Cronauer?  - Still eating, sir.

993
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,380
我要ASAP见到他
I want to see him ASAP.

994
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,390
什么 长官
What, sir?

995
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:25,390
- 尽快  - VG 长官
- As soon as possible.  - VG, sir.

996
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,520
我们中断这段广播...
We interrupt to bring you an emergency selection...

997
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,810
因有紧急的选歌
of the Benny Goodman Orchestra.

998
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,350
我们需考虑不再让他广播
We simply need to consider taking him off the air.

999
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,980
中尉 我们每周都接到
Lieutenant, we get hundreds,

1000
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,570
上千封信和电话 歌迷信件
maybe thousands of calls and letters each week, fan mail.

1001
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,990
他是军中电台有史以来 第一位有歌迷邮件的人
He's the first man in the history of Armed Forces Radio to get fan mail.

1002
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:45,490
这个国家的每位大兵 每天都听他一天二次的节目...
Every GI in this country is glued to his radio twice a day...

1003
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,290
在6点和16点去收听那个疯子
at 0600 hours and 1600 hours to hear that lunatic.

1004
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,750
长官 那人有不敬的趋向
Sir, the man has got an irreverent tendency.

1005
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,630
他对前任副总统尼克森 作了十分讽刺的言论
He did a very off-colour parody of former VP Nixon.

1006
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,130
我以为这是哗众取宠
I thought it was hilarious.

1007
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:03,050
诚心尊重 长官 前任副总统是位好人和正直的人
Respectfully, sir, the former VP is a good man and a decent man.

1008
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,310
狗屁 我本人认识他
Bullshit. I know Nixon personally.

1009
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,930
他留下的狗屁事足可制造毒气了
He lugs a trainload of shit behind him that would fertilise the Sinai.

1010
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,060
我连苹果也不会向那王八蛋买
I wouldn't buy an apple from the son of a bitch,

1011
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:14,400
我还视他是位好朋友
and I consider him a good, close personal friend.

1012
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,230
我们谈谈正事吧 是怎么回事
Let's get down to business here, general. What is going on here?

1013
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,190
这件事情非同小可
We've got a mounting crisis in this country.

1014
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,150
有位深受弟兄们欢迎的DJ
We've got a deejay that the men dearly love.

1015
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,700
如你们有私人恩怨的话 去解决掉 好吗
If you two have personal problems, solve them, will you?

1016
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:32,460
谢谢你 中尉
Thank you, lieutenant.

1017
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,210
说出来吧 迪克
Speak your piece, Dick.

1018
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,670
不是不尊重你 长官
Due respect, sir.

1019
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,800
我在军中已有15年指挥经验
I have over 15 years command experience in this Army.

1020
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,010
你真的要我不说话也不做事...
Do you really expect me to run this radio station...

1021
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,100
来管理这个电台吗
with nothing to say and no way to do it?

1022
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,850
目前 是如此
Right now, yes.

1023
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,400
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1024
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,820
这件事还没结束
This is not over yet.

1025
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,200
你怎么还在这里
Why you still here?

1026
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,660
聪明小子 你说什么 我正放轻松的喝杯老酒
Sparky. Sitting back, having a cup of formaldehyde.

1027
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:13,710
你说我们要碰面 谈陈的事
You say after you go out with Trinh, you meet me to talk about her.

1028
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,250
- 没什么好谈的 她不喜欢我  - 不 她喜欢
- Nothing to discuss, she doesn't like me.  - Yes, she do.

1029
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,960
- 不 她不喜欢我  - 她确实喜欢你
- No, she don't.  - She do liking you.

1030
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:20,250
她今天要见你 离此不远
She want to meet you today. She's not far from here.

1031
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,260
- 我不能去 我4点还要回去广播...  - 今天去见她
- I can't, I gotta be back on the air...  - You have to meet her today.

1032
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,430
- 否则 错过机会  - 我可不想错过机会
- Otherwise, you miss your big chance.  - I don't wanna miss my big chance.

1033
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,640
对 来 我们走
Yes, come, we go.

1034
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,890
你好像跟印弟安人学的英文 "我们走"
Sound like you learned English from Tonto. "We go."

1035
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,220
- 来吧  - 好
- Come on.  - Okay.

1036
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,850
我仍不相信她真的要见我
I still can't believe she really wants to see me.

1037
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,100
是真的
Yeah.

1038
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:39,820
我想那海滩电影感动了她 是吗
I guess that beach movie really impressed her, huh?

1039
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,320
我要送她东西
I gotta get her something.

1040
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,320
- 香蕉如何  - 不
- What about bananas?  - No.

1041
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:48,030
不 这会导致误解 你是对的 你想...
No, that doesn't say the right thing. You're right. How about...

1042
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,510
噢 我的天
Oh, my God!

1043
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:16,350
老天
God!

1044
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,130
4207...
Four-twenty-seven as far as...

1045
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,260
噢 我的酒吧 为什么要这么做
Oh, my bar! Why? Who do that?

1046
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,270
退后
Get back.

1047
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,400
死了
Dead.

1048
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:12,950
- 你不能把他丢在这  - 他已死了 士兵
- You can't just leave them.  - This boy's gone, soldier.

1049
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,710
- 我们走吧  - 来吧 退后
- Let's go.  - Come on, get back.

1050
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,130
退后
Get back.

1051
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,890
消防4队 火正在蔓延过来...
Fire 4, there's a fire in the landing...

1052
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,810
就在大楼外面
on the outside of the building.

1053
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,530
嗨 他去那里
Hey, where's he going?

1054
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,280
你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

1055
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:57,290
你知道不能念没被检查过的新闻
You're forbidden to read anything not checked.

1056
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:59,620
- 什么 我在场  - 飞行员 你知道规定
- What? I was there.  - Airman, you know the rules.

1057
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,120
正当的新闻 要由适当管道播出
If this is legitimate, it must go through proper channels.

1058
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,920
听着 这是真的事件 你以为这那来的
Listen, it's an actual event. Where do you think this came from?

1059
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:07,590
我只想报导真相 来改变一下
I just wanna report the truth. It'd be a nice change of pace.

1060
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,510
- 怎么回事  - 长官 你听我说好吗
- What's going on here?  - Sir, will you listen to me?

1061
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,390
这不是官方新闻 就我所知 这没有发生
Not official news. Far as I'm concerned, it didn't happen.

1062
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,180
- 发生了  - 你闭嘴
- It did happen...  - You shut your mouth.

1063
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,810
你怕什么 怕人们发现有战争在进行
What are you afraid of? People might find out there's a war?

1064
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,480
这新闻不是官方的 飞行员
This news is not official, airman.

1065
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,690
你要人们相信此地很安全 但不是
You want everyone going under the assumption it's safe here. It's not.

1066
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,820
战斗不只在山上 城里也是...
The fighting's not in the hills. It's downtown...

1067
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,450
我说那不关你的事
I said it is none of your goddamn business.

1068
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,660
我明白你的意思了
I see your point.

1069
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,660
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1070
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,910
我想一进来 被冷气吹的 头昏了
I guess I get inside, hit these air conditioners. I get a little dizzy.

1071
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,130
谢谢你们纠正了我
Thanks for setting me straight.

1072
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,090
我没事了
It'll be okay.

1073
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:16,320
早安 越南
Good morning, Vietnam.

1074
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,950
嗨 我知道不是早上 这是我的招牌...
Hey, I know it's not the morning, but that's my trademark...

1075
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,790
"午安"听起来太消沉了
and "good evening" sounds too depressing.

1076
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,620
嗨 现在报新闻
Hey, we're going right now to the news.

1077
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:30,130

From England, today, Princess Margaret threw a shoe.

1078

1079
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,670
同时 伊莉莎白皇后...
Also Elizab... Queen Elizabeth, Liz...

1080
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,630
伊莉莎白·泰勒

1081
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:40,140
结婚6个月后还仍维持着 不错 伊莉 嗨
She's still married after six months. Way to go, Liz, hey.

1082
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:45,640
对 今日的西贡 根据官方的消息
All right, in Saigon today, according to official sources,

1083
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:47,560
是一切平安
nothing actually happened.

1084
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:51,320
一件非官方的事是一个炸弹并没有正式的爆炸在14:30时
One thing that didn't officially happen was a bomb didn't explode at 14:30 hours,

1085
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,860
非官方的摧毁了吉米咖啡厅
unofficially destroying Jimmy Wah's Cafe.

1086
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:57,160
- 把他赶出去  - 3人非官方的受了伤
- Get him out of there.  - Three men were unofficially wounded.

1087
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:01,120
有二人的身份至今仍不清楚非官方的被杀了
And two men whose identities are still not known were unofficially dead.

1088
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,620
- 把门撞开  - 警察 救护车...
- Break the goddamn door down.  - Police, ambulance...

1089
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,500
和消防队已据信是非官方的...
and fire department responded at what's believed to be unofficial...

1090
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:07,960
现在这种时候
at this present moment.

1091
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:10,130
把开关关掉
Turn the power off in that studio.

1092
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:11,920
- 这...  - 马上关掉
- It's...  - Turn it off now.

1093
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,420
我只是认为你们该...
I just wanted to think that you should...

1094
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,180
那人该送军法审判
The man should be court-martialled.

1095
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:05,600
你们认为这是本周我该处理的最严重事件吗 不是
You think this is the most serious set of affairs I have to address? It's not.

1096
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:08,850
我不相信你要放过此事 那人是颠复份子
I can't believe you're gonna pass on this. The man is a goddamn subversive.

1097
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,100
- 他犯了个错误  - 错误 长官
- He made a mistake.  - Mistake, sir?

1098
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,940
当他报导我们军队动向时我可不想在场
I don't wanna be around when he broadcasts U.S. Troop movements.

1099
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,320
我是严格遵守由军方情报处规定来管理电台的
I run the station according to strict guidelines set by military intelligence.

1100
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,240
军方情报处 这倒是种矛盾的语气
Military intelligence? There's a contradiction in terMs.

1101
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:22,410
长官 那人是个活动炸弹
Sir, the man is a walking keg of dynamite.

1102
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,580
在他广播中的8周里 将军
In the eight weeks he's been on the air, general,

1103
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,580
他以违背命令作为风格
he's disobeyed orders as to style and content.

1104
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,750
他报非官方的新闻 6个月后他会变成怎样
He's read unofficial news. What's he gonna be like in six months?

1105
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,080
他变成十倍受欢迎时该怎么办 将军
What's he gonna be like when he's ten times as popular, general?

1106
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,380
那时要他不广播会很容易吗
How easy is it gonna be to get him off the air then?

1107
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,840
谁来接康纳的节目呢
Who will do the Cronauer show?

1108
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,930
嗯 哈克能 长官 直到我找到接替人选
Well, Hauk can do it, sir, till I find a replacement.

1109
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,310
好 现在起停他职
Okay, for now, suspend him.

1110
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,350
长官 你做了正确的选择
Sir, you've made the correct choice.

1111
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:52,480
她来啦 Diana Ross和Suprawns
Here she is, Diana Ross and the Suprawns.

1112
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:55,860

Set me free. Why don't you babe?

1113
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:58,320
放开我吧 好吗 宝贝
Set me free. Why don't you babe?

1114
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:02,570
你并不需要我 就会惹我生气...
You don't really need me You just keep me steaming on...

1115
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,330
我来介绍乐队成员
Let me introduce the members of the band

1116
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:07,410
Larry Pisces 非常感谢
Larry Pisces Thank you very much

1117
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:12,120
- 他说什么  - 他说你已经喝得太多了
- What'd he say?  - He say you drink too much already.

1118
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,630
嗯 告诉他 我喝酒了 才能如此滑稽
Well, tell him I drink so I can be this funny.

1119
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,260
他说 一点也不好笑
It's not funny at all, he said.

1120
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,930
告诉他 说谢谢 谢谢炸了另一种语言
Tell him, thanks. It's nice to bomb in another language.

1121
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,600
你再喝的话会不舒服 走吧
You will sick if you drink some more. Come on.

1122
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:33,060
我的村子离此不远 你可以去休息一下
My village not too far from here. You could come there for resting.

1123
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,150
你可以看我们的生活方式
You could see how we live.

1124
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,560
听着 聪明小子
Listen, Sparky,

1125
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:39,900
我看你们的生活方式不会使我高兴
I don't think seeing your little production of Our Town is gonna cheer me up.

1126
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:43,150
- 你能看到陈  - 我开车
- You see Trinh there.  - I'll drive.

1127
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,370
红皮 黄皮 红皮
Red leather, yellow leather, red leather.

1128
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:47,870
红皮 黄皮 红皮...
Red leather, yellow leather. Red leather...

1129
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,870
长官 长官 报新闻是一回事
Sir, sir, reading the news is one thing,

1130
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,580
但你写的那东西 不好笑 很悲哀
but this stuff you wrote, it's not funny, sir. It's sad.

1131
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,460
长官 我求你
Sir, I'm begging you.

1132
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,580
别当滑稽客 你不是这块料
Don't try to do comedy. It's not in your blood.

1133
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,750
我会做的很好 喜剧是创造出来的
I'll do fine. Comedy is what you make it.

1134
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,340
我有好多页的上好题材
I've got pages and pages of great material.

1135
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:03,090
对不 艾伯
Right, Abersold?

1136
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,590
恐怕你会一败涂地 长官
I'm afraid you're gonna be hitting bottom, sir.

1137
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,640
如不好笑的话 为何你们在打字时我听见笑声
If it isn't funny, then why did I hear you laughing when you typed it?

1138
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,770
我在想别的事
I was thinking of something else.

1139
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:14,230
谢谢你的支持 我有节目要做了
Thank you for your support. Now I've got a show to do.

1140
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:18,400
- 长官 你不风趣 打听一下  - 问我
- Sir, you're not funny. Ask around.  - Ask me.

1141
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:20,610
长官 我们都很尊敬你 我认为你想...
Sir, with all due respect, I think you're gonna...

1142
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,400
你也许能下蛋 我的意思是 一个大蛋
You might lay an egg. I mean, a big egg.

1143
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:24,570
我的意思是 我了解风趣 我不认为你是
I mean, I know funny, and I don't think you're it.

1144
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:28,240
但是 嗨 就像 我 我对工具就不内行
But, hey, such is life. Me, I'm not much with power tools.

1145
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,910
嗨 那是派图·克拉的精彩歌曲
Hey, that was the great exciting sound of Petula Clark.

1146
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:35,420
- 海滩少年 是那些人才对  - 海滩少年
- Beach Boys. Those were guys.  - Of the Beach Boys.

1147
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,710
嗨 我的时间到了 马帝·李·卓威兹
Hey, that wraps it up for me, Marty Lee Dreiwitz.

1148
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,630
艾德伦·康纳外出执行短暂任务
Adrian Cronauer is on temporary assignment,

1149
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,300
但 伙计们 我有个大惊喜给你们
but, boy, do I have a surprise for you.

1150
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,170
别太捧他了 他会跌得很惨的
Don't build him up. You'll let them down.

1151
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,220
请欢迎终于出现在麦克风前 中尉笑匠
Please welcome to the microphone, the lieutenant of laughs,

1152
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,430
名嘴军官 西半球的名人
the officer of oral, the Westmoreland of wit,

1153
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,270
摇摆的哈克
swinging Steven Hauk.

1154
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,060
哈啰 越南 欢迎
Hello, Vietnam, and greetings.

1155
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:01,070
不久 就报新闻 然后...
Soon, the news. Then...

1156
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,280
史帝中尉
Lieutenant Steve?

1157
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,700
- 哪一位  - 你的老友法国人
- Who's that?  - It's your old pal Frenchy.

1158
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,660
法国人 我问你一件事
Frenchy, let me ask you,

1159
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,030
你喜欢美食吗
do you like good food?

1160
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,620
噢 当然 法国人热爱美食
Oh, but of course, the French love good food.

1161
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:18,290
嗯 那我想你就是美食主义者了
Well, then I guess that would make you an Eydie Gorme.

1162
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:22,050
噢 史帝中尉
Oh, Lieutenant Steve.

1163
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,130
噢 法国人
Oh, Frenchy.

1164
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,720
噢 史帝中尉
Oh, Lieutenant Steve.

1165
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,220
法国人... 我想 我其实不该取笑法国人
Frenchy... You know, I really shouldn't kid Frenchy,

1166
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,810
因为有时他会...
because sometimes he Stan Getz...

1167
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,730
生我的气 他就有可能伤害我
Mad at me, and he could Al Hirt me.

1168
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,100
史帝中尉 我们来点音乐吧
Lieutenant Steve, let's play some music.

1169
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,820
好 法国人 你想听什么
Okay, Frenchy, what would you like to hear?

1170
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,490
嗯 我喜欢波卡舞曲正如喜欢身旁人
Well, uh, I love a good polka as much as the next man.

1171
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:48,490
嗯 为我的好友法国人...
Well, a good polka it is...

1172
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,570
放波卡舞曲
for my good friend Frenchy.

1173
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,540
我想有人该道歉了吧
I think some apologies are in order.

1174
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:15,220
你不会还想继续广播下去吧 是吗 长官
You're not gonna continue this broadcast, are you, sir?

1175
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,850
- 他们在干什么  - 噢 他们是佛教徒
- What are they doing?  - Oh, they're Buddhists.

1176
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:02,190
他们打坐祈求和平 智慧和知识
They're sitting for peace, wisdom and knowledge.

1177
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,150
他们在等待启发
They're waiting for enlightenment.

1178
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,710
这人的儿子被美军地雷炸死
This man lose one son from blasting American mine.

1179
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:30,550
他父亲和哥哥在很久以前被法国人杀死
His father and brother was killed by French long ago.

1180
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,180
这对他很不公平
I think that's not fair to him.

1181
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,030
看
Look.

1182
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,660
他说这没什么 了不起 看
It's cool, no big deal. Look.

1183
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,920
看 那儿 放
Look, up there. Pull.

1184
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,760
放
Pull.

1185
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:17,820
你不了解 不了解
You not understand, you not.

1186
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:22,580
我们在一起没有结果 康纳
We no future together, Cronauer.

1187
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:26,710
我的国家也许没有未来
My country maybe no future.

1188
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,790
嗨 我喜欢你 我只想当你的朋友 好吗
Hey, I like you. I just wanna be your friend, okay?

1189
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:36,130
- 我知道不好听  - 我不能这么做 康纳
- I know it sounds dumb.  - I not can do this, Cronauer.

1190
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:40,090
不 不能当朋友 康纳
No. No friend, Cronauer.

1191
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,760
对我不好
Not comfort for me.

1192
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:51,190
我弟弟 是的可以当朋友 但是越南女人 不能当朋友
My brother, okay, friends, but Vietnam ladies, not friends.

1193
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,110
拜托 好吗
Please, okay?

1194
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,530
- 不能成为朋友  - 好吧
- Not friends.  - Of course.

1195
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,460
好棒的一周
Great week.

1196
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,240
出来 走
Move out. Go.

1197
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:49,660
下车 走 走 走
Get off. Go, go, go.

1198
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,750
这是你们所听到最好的波卡舞曲
That's about as good a polka as you'll ever hear.

1199
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,050
不 我想康纳不会再广播了 先生
No, I don't think that Cronauer is going to be back in the air, sir.

1200
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:04,050
- 你要康纳再广播  - 你想让他回来
- You want Cronauer back on the air.  - You want him back?

1201
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,810
我们想让康纳...
We want Cronauer...

1202
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,970
我们有二大袋的邮件...
We've gotten duffel bags filled with information...

1203
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,770
要求康纳再复职
asking for Cronauer's reinstatement.

1204
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,980
大家全恨哈克 他们要康纳回来
The men all hate Hauk. They want Cronauer back.

1205
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:17,020
他是位振奋精神的人 波卡舞曲是替代不了的
He's an exhilarating personality, and polkas are just no substitute.

1206
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,190
我想我要看个范例
I think that I see a pattern forming here.

1207
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,860
长官 这些信件太露骨了
Sir, these letters are unequivocal.

1208
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:23,780
比如 "哈克 去吃一袋粪 你真烂"
E. g. ,"Hey, Hauk, eat a bag of shit. You suck."

1209
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:26,950
这已表明重点了 长官 没什么好说
That's pretty much to the point, sir. Not much grey area in this one.

1210
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,290
我们只接到一通肯定的电话...
We got one call from some guy in Wichita...

1211
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:31,460
他认为哈克的笑语是空中阁楼
who thought Hauk was visionary and interesting.

1212
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:35,960
其他一千一百通电话说他根本不会说笑话要他省省吧
The other 1,100 calls said that the man can't do comedy to save his dick.

1213
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,670
这是直接引用的 长官
That's a direct quote, sir.

1214
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,590
我今早接了90通电话 他们不喜欢哈克
I've taken 90 calls this morning. They just don't like Hauk.

1215
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,130
一封来自迪南部队的信
From a Marine in Da Nang:

1216
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:45,930
"哈克中尉把死人的睾丸也吓干了"
"Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls."

1217
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:50,140
我不知那是什么意思 长官 但是我看来那非常的否定
I have no idea what that means, sir, but it seems very negative to me.

1218
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:53,480
我想部队是想告诉我们一件事 小伙子们
I think the troops are trying to tell us something, fellas.

1219
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:57,060
长官 如是我的节目内容地问题 我能改
Sir, if it is my programming choices, I can change.

1220
01:16:57,230 --> 01:16:58,650
我会播放波卡舞曲是...
I've been broadcasting the polkas...

1221
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,690
因为我认为部份...
because I thought a certain segment of the men...

1222
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:04,070
被康纳的摇滚乐所分裂的人不代表全体
weren't represented by Cronauer's broadcasts of rock 'n' roll.

1223
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,200
但我可以偶而放盖瑞·路易斯的歌
But I can easily play an occasional Gary Lewis record.

1224
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:10,200
你放不放波卡舞曲没多大差别
It doesn't make a damn whether you play polkas or don't play polkas.

1225
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:14,420
军中的政治 不是针对你个人 大家比较喜欢他不喜欢你
Military politics. Nothing personal. The men like him better than they do you.

1226
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,340
他故意播报非官方的新闻
He maliciously and with purposeful intent read unofficial news.

1227
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,170
不 不 不 他是犯了个错误 但我们全会犯错
No, no, no. He made a mistake. We all make mistakes.

1228
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,970
现在 是很敏感的平衡状况
Now, this thing is a delicate balance over here,

1229
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,800
我不想全依赖一位播音员
and I don't want it dependent on a disc jockey.

1230
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:30,890
弟兄们要他回来 我就要他回来
The men want him back. I want him back.

1231
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,480
长官 你只听到不喜欢我那种幽默的人
Sir, you heard from the men who don't like my humour,

1232
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,600
那些沉默大众喜欢我的人呢
but what about the silent masses who do?

1233
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:40,820
至于波卡舞曲 音乐品味较高
And as far as polkas, they are a much maligned musical taste.

1234
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,740
中尉 你是东南西北分不清
You don't know whether you're fucked, powder-burned or snake-bit.

1235
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:47,240
我才不在乎波卡舞曲 他们在大声叫喊
I don't care about polkas. They're rioting in Hue.

1236
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,990
我们每个月有上千部队来此
We're bringing in thousands of troops every month.

1237
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,410
西贡的恐怖活动增加了
Terrorism's on the uprise in Saigon.

1238
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:55,370
这是国家问题和你放不放波卡舞曲...
The problems of this country have not one goddamned thing to do...

1239
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,880
一点也没有关系
with whether you play polkas or don't play polkas.

1240
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,090
弟兄们要他回来 我要他回来
The men want him back. I want him back.

1241
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:03,340
让他复职
Reinstate the man.

1242
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:08,800
长官 在我内心里 我知我很风趣
Sir, in my heart, I know I'm funny.

1243
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,260
谢谢你 中尉
Thank you, lieutenant.

1244
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,030
- 你在这啊 长官  - 拜托 别叫我"长官"
- There you are, sir.  - Please, don't call me "sir."

1245
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:26,570
我刚由总部回来 你又要广播了 长官
It just came down the pike. You're back on the air, sir.

1246
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:30,160
- 我不做了  - 不做了 是什么意思
- I'm not going on.  - What do you mean, you're not going on?

1247
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,740
听不明白吗 也许该参加我的英文班
If you don't understand, you should take my English class.

1248
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:34,120
我不做了
I'm not going on.

1249
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,620
你很帅 艾伯 别以为我没注意
You're a very attractive man, Abersold. Don't think I haven't noticed.

1250
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,750
你会很无聊 你知道的
You'll be bored, you know.

1251
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,880
- 你要如何打发时间  - 不知道
- What are you gonna do?  - I don't know.

1252
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:47,680
也许去城中找位叫菲尔的越南人
I may go downtown, look for a Vietnamese man named Phil.

1253
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,760
或是留在这里听白藩的老唱片
Or I may just stay here and listen to old Pat Boone records.

1254
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,930
试着找寻它背后的意义
Try and find some hidden meaning.

1255
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,060
因为 基本来说 我认为那人是位被误解的天才
Because, basically, I believe that that man is a misunderstood genius.

1256
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,980
天才 你是在对我说什么
Genius? What are you saying to me?

1257
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:01,310
我说我不干了 艾德
I'm saying I'm through, Ed.

1258
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,860
我已厌倦别人对我说什么不能讲
I'm tired of people telling me what I can't say.

1259
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:07,190
"这段新闻不是官方的 那评论太讽刺"
"This news isn't official. That comment is too sarcastic."

1260
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,990
我连理查德·尼克森也不能开玩笑
I can't even make fun of Richard Nixon.

1261
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,530
那个人正大声叫喊着要被取笑
And there's a man who's screaming out to be made fun of.

1262
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,580
所以何苦呢
So fuck it.

1263
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:15,450
对不起
Sorry.

1264
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,790
- 他不要紧吗  - 不 菲尔 他不好
- Is he all right?  - No, Phil, he's not all right.

1265
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,170
如果事情顺利的话他也不会将白藩视为美丽的天才
A man does not refer to Pat Boone as a beautiful genius if things are all right.

1266
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,720
- 长官  - 加利
- Sir.  - Garlick.

1267
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,390
我要你校对一下这些优先新闻稿
I'd like you to collate these one-minute spots prior to broadcast.

1268
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,100
你对这个有问题吗 年轻人
You have a problem with that, young man?

1269
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:40,230
绝对没有
Absolutely not.

1270
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,060
- 我靠校对过活 长官  - 好
- I live to collate, sir.  - Good.

1271
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:45,820
我也是
So do I.

1272
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:52,110
- 找份工作  - 找份工作 再来一次
- Get a job.  - Get a job, again.

1273
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:56,120
"找到工作" 对 成了 你出师了
"Get a job." Right. We got it, you're cooking now.

1274
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,370
- 长官  - 艾德华
- Sir?  - Edward.

1275
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:00,660
我想要个解释
I'd like an explanation.

1276
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:04,790
- 有没有什么特别的事吗  - 很多人要你
- On anything in particular?  - A lot of people went to the mat for you.

1277
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,970
成千的人写信来 打电话 想让你复职
Thousands of guys wrote in, called in, trying to get you reinstated.

1278
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:12,260
我认为你亏欠他们全体...
And I literally think that you owe it to all of them...

1279
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,760
该再回去广播
to get your ass back on the air.

1280
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,770
天知道 军方不要我 艾德
If you haven't noticed, the Army doesn't really want me, Ed.

1281
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,350
从我下机那天起就在找我麻烦
Been harassing me since the day I got off the plane.

1282
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:22,190
那又怎样
So what?

1283
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,480
重要的是战场上那些人 记得吗
It's the guys in the field that matter, remember?

1284
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:26,070
死的是那些人
Those are the guys that are dying.

1285
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:29,440
艾德华 我试着说真相 他们却赶我走
Edward, I tried to tell the truth and they kicked me off the air.

1286
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,900
我会再犯错 迪克生会送我去打仗
I screw up once more, Dickerson sends me into the field.

1287
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:33,280
我则装在箱子里回来
I come home in a box.

1288
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:35,740
你所做的对很多人很重要
What you do is important to a lot of people.

1289
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:38,870
忘了吧 好吗 听着 我放弃了
Forget it, will you? Listen, I give up.

1290
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:42,750
废话说够了 好吗 够了 我要走了 再见
I'm gonna phone it in, okay? Enough bullshit. I'm out of here. See you.

1291
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,040
- 我请你吃中饭  - 不能让你这么做
- I'll buy you some lunch.  - Can't let you do that.

1292
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,670
如我不去上课
If I don't get to class,

1293
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,170
会有很多越南人说着残缺不全的英文
there's gonna be Vietnamese speaking in choppy sentences.

1294
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:52,420
- 我们必需谈 马上谈  - 不要现在 伙计 别这样
- Look, we gotta talk now.  - Not now, man, come on.

1295
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:54,340
我不相信你
I can't believe you.

1296
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,390
什么 不好意思
What? That's it?

1297
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,560
你把整个烂事情丢下了 把烂事情吊在半空
You're gonna leave the fucking thing. Leave everything fucking hanging.

1298
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,520
人们在依靠你
People are depending on you.

1299
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:05,980
艾德华 拜托 一年中竟说了二个脏字
Edward, please. That's two nasty words in one year.

1300
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:09,110
- 原谅我  - 嗨
- Forgive me.  - Hey.

1301
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,400
你要送我去学校 还是再买单车
You wanna give me a ride, or am I gonna have to buy another bike?

1302
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:13,650
你惹火我了
You're pissing me off.

1303
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:28,790
- 为何道路阻塞了  - 我看看
- What the hell's the holdup?  - Check it out.

1304
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:35,260
Garlick 你别说了好吗
Garlick, will you cut it out?

1305
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,890
你的口气渐渐像40年代电影中的爱尔兰神父
You're beginning to sound like a priest in a '40s movie.

1306
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:41,560
"当弟兄依靠你时我不会开除你"
"We are not firing you. The boys are depending on you."

1307
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:51,980
- 各位  - 你在干什么 艾德
- Gentlemen.  - What are you doing, Ed?

1308
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:53,690
嗨 大伙
Hey, guys.

1309
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,360
看看这位是谁
Guess who the hell I got in here.

1310
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:57,240
- 别做这种狗屁事  - Groucho Marx
- Don't do this.  - Groucho Marx!

1311
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:59,830
- 克肯参议员  - 卷毛狗
- Senator Dirksen!  - Hey, Curly!

1312
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,580
拜托 拜托 再猜
Come on. Come on. Guess again.

1313
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:03,370
噢 不必了 不必了 加利
Oh, bag it, bag it, Garlick.

1314

这位老兄是这里独一无二的君子
The fellow I got in here is the gentleman,

1315
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:11,420
- 广播界之王  - 你死定了
- the one and the only king of the airwaves,  - You're a dead man.

1316
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:13,090
艾德伦·康纳

Oh, give me a break, man. It's too hot for radio shit, okay?

1320
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,310
- 来吧  - 来一个吧
- Come on.  - Come on.

1321

1332
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,090
比意大利咖啡或是灌肠剂还要强烈

1337
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,520
为什么 因绿色比较相配 我...
Why? Because it matches with the green, I don't...

1338
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,230

I don't know where they are. I don't even know where am.

1506
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,750
什么也看不见
Can't see dick.

1507
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,590
好像和瞎子雷·查尔斯一起打猎
Like hunting with Ray Charles.

1508
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,470
没问题 你们可以出来了
It okay! You can come out now!

1509
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:01,560
听见了吗 不和我说话我找不到
Didn't you hear? I cannot find you unless you talk to me.

1510
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:03,390
待在这里太危险了
It's too dangerous staying here.

1511
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,810
你不相信是我吗
You don't believe it's me?

1512
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:07,360
好
Okay.

1513
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:10,030
给他一记
Flip them the bird.

1514
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,650
端
Tuan?

1515
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,610
嗨 你在这里呀 康纳
Hey, there you are, Cronauer.

1516
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:17,530
- 你如何找到我们的 聪明小子  - 你的吉普车
- How the hell you find us, Sparky?  - Your jeep.

1517
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:22,000
我们显然不是在高棉
We're obviously not in Cambodia.

1518
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:26,460
再试试
Try it again.

1519
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,880
- 该死的  - 再来一次
- Shit.  - One more time.

1520
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:36,300
天杀的
Goddamn it.

1521
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:38,930
我们的吉普被炸了 他的也发不动了
Our jeep gets blown off the road and his van won't start.

1522
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,890
真棒
That's great.

1523
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,810
你可知我们为何会再走回来吗
You know why we ended up in the same place?

1524
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:44,640
- 为什么  - 你向右跛
- Why?  - Your limp pulled us to the right,

1525
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:48,770
使我们绕圈子 紧跟我走 我不想再绕圈子了
we're going in circles. Stick with me, I don't wanna go around again.

1526
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,400
不再是在堪萨斯了 Toto
We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.

1527
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,580
听
Listen.

1528
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:10,550
在那边
Somewhere over there.

1529
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:16,010
在那里 老兄
There it is, man!

1530
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,260
出租
Taxi!

1531
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:25,270
噢 老天 哈啰 士兵 哈啰
Yo, GI! Hello, sailor, hello!

1532
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:27,850
嗨
Hey!

1533
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,270
避免刮胡子后的痛苦
To avoid razor-burn problems,

1534
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,770
只要用冷水刮胡子别用热水
always rinse you razor with cold water instead of hot.

1535
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:13,110
你的皮肤会感觉好多了
You skin will look and feel a whole lot better.

1536
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,650
闷热中的卫生到此为止 明天...
That's it for Hygiene in the Heat. Tomorrow we'll...

1537
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:17,150
欢迎你回来
Welcome back.

1538
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,070
嗯 谢谢你 士官长 我想念你
Well, thank you, sergeant. I've missed you.

1539
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:23,830
我通知你要离开此了
I'm informing you that you're out of here.

1540
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:26,620
我要你收拾好行李明天下午走
I want your bags packed and ready to go tomorrow afternoon.

1541
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,920
你没有这权力 我会向上级报告
You don't have the power. I'll take this to the authorities.

1542
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:31,830
我就是上级 你这低能儿
I am the authorities, you moron.

1543
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,470
噢 我抓到你的弱点了 康纳
Oh, I got your pansy-ass in a sling now, Cronauer.

1544
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,970
谁是端
Who's Tuan?

1545
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:43,100
由安勒接你们回来的人报告说...
The guys who flew you in radioed they picked up...

1546
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,140
他们载了你和加利及位越南少年
a South Vietnamese boy with you and Garlick.

1547
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:47,060
这位越南少年是谁
Who is this South Vietnamese boy?

1548
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:49,810
我班上的一位朋友冒险去救我
He's a friend from my class who risked his ass to save my life.

1549
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,060
朋友
A friend?

1550
01:39:51,230 --> 01:39:52,610
你朋友是位越共恐怖份子
Your friend is a VC terrorist.

1551
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,650
对 我母亲是狼人 对吗
Yeah, and my mother is a werewolf, right?

1552
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:58,110
端也是泛德多一份子
Tuan is also known as Phan Duc Tho.

1553
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,450
越南警方因...
He's currently wanted by the South Vietnamese police...

1554
01:40:00,610 --> 01:40:02,700
几起爆炸案而通缉他
in connection with several bombings in the area,

1555
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:05,660
包括吉米的店
including the one at Jimmy Wah's.

1556
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:08,790
当然 你对这件意外一定很熟
Surely, you're familiar with that incident.

1557
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:11,500
你是否奇怪一位越南少年...
Do you ever wonder how a young South Vietnamese boy...

1558
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:14,790
怎能进出越共占领的地区
gets into and out of VC-held territory?

1559
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,380
那边很危险
It's dangerous out there.

1560
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:18,630
事情突如其来
Things just jump out at you.

1561
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,970
而这男孩却能毫无损伤的进出
And yet this boy can get in and out without a scratch.

1562
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:23,430
吉米的店呢
And what about Jimmy Wah's?

1563
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,430
你不奇怪为何你...
Didn't you ever wonder why you were pulled out...

1564
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,100
在爆炸前被拉走
just moments before the whole place blew up?

1565
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:31,440
或是你平常不太爱追根究底
Or are you normally not that inquisitive?

1566
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:36,400
泛德多的朋友
Friends of Phan Duc Tho.

1567
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:41,280
这三位在这照片拍完后不久就被枪杀了
These three were executed shortly after this photo was taken.

1568
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,370
你的朋友是下一位
Your friend is next.

1569
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,870
我不期望对这件事你会赞成我
I don't recommend that you tangle with me on this one.

1570
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,710
高阶军官可不会...
There's not too many high-ranking officers...

1571
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,000
同情和恐怖份子有挂勾的人
who would be sympathetic to a serviceman with links to terrorists.

1572
01:40:57,170 --> 01:41:00,010
军方对这种事很不赞同
The Army is kind of quirky that way.

1573
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:02,680
对于背叛美国的罪刑是要...
A conviction on a charge of treason against the United States...

1574
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,680
二眼翻白的 如你明白我的意思
carries with it penalties on the stiff side, if you know what I mean.

1575
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:09,390
我已安排好荣誉退伍...
I have arranged for an honourable discharge...

1576
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:11,770
使你不发生事情而离去
provided you leave without incident.

1577
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:15,190
- 立正  - 稍息
- Ten  - At ease.

1578
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:20,740
康纳 我对这件事很抱歉
Cronauer, I'm sorry as hell about this thing.

1579
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:23,820
天杀的 我喜欢你 孩子 我喜欢你做的事
Goddamn it, I like you, son. I like what you do.

1580
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:26,950
最重要的是我喜欢你为弟兄们做的
Most of all, I like what you've done for the men.

1581
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,120
但事实就是事实
But facts are facts.

1582
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,080
这有可能使军方难堪
This could give the Army a black eye.

1583
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:35,120
这次我担保不了你了 孩子
I'm not gonna cover for you this time, son.

1584
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:39,130
长官 节目怎么办
Sir? What about the show?

1585
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,960
我们会处理它
We'll handle it.

1586
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,090
抱歉 孩子
I'm sorry, son.

1587
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:51,020
你为何要这么做
Why'd you do this?

1588
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:57,150
我不喜欢你的风格 你的政治或你的幽默
I don't like your style, your politics or your sense of humour.

1589
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:59,900
我不喜欢你说的话或说法
I don't like what you say or how you say it.

1590
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:01,690
从现在起 在越南作战的人...
From now on, the fighting men of Vietnam...

1591
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:03,820
将会听到他们该听到的
will hear exactly what they're supposed to hear.

1592
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:05,740
你明天下午6点半去机场...
You're on a DC-8 from Tan Son Nhat Airport...

1593
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:07,530
搭DC-8班机回家
tomorrow at 1830 hours.

1594
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,790
我建议你安静的收拾行李
I recommend you pack quietly.

1595
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:13,700
我对你只有这些话 飞行员
That's all I have for you, airman.

1596
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:26,380
你知道吗
You know,

1597
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:30,260
你比白人历史上最需要口交的人还悲惨
you're in more dire need of a blow job than any white man in history.

1598
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:38,270
哇 你来了 迪克 先别走
Whoa, there, Dick, put the brakes on.

1599
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:41,070
我要等飞行员走了再跟你谈谈
I wanted to wait until the airman left to talk with you.

1600
01:42:41,230 --> 01:42:43,570
嗯 迪克 我要把你调走
Uh, Dick, I'm transferring you.

1601
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:46,240
调我走 长官
Transferring me, sir?

1602
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,240
去那里 长官
Where to, sir?

1603
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:49,570
你去关岛
You're going to Guam.

1604
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,530
关岛 长官 那里什么事也没有
Guam, sir? There's nothing going on in Guam.

1605
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,790
为何选关岛
Why Guam?

1606
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:56,870
迪克 我忍了你很久了以前我以为你有点疯颠
Dick, I've covered for you a lot of times because I thought you was a little crazy,

1607
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,920
但你不是疯颠 你是恶毒
but you're not crazy, you're mean.

1608
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:01,630
而这里只是个电台而已
And this is just radio.

1609
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:14,720
"比白人历史上更需要口交的还悲惨"
"More dire need of a blow job than any white man in history."

1610
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:16,980
这真好笑
That's funny.

1611
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:27,950
嗨 老师
Hey, teacher.

1612
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:30,200
几时教我们打垒球
When are you gonna teach us to softball?

1613
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,780
听着 我要和你谈谈 现在 来
Listen, I gotta talk to you. Now. Come on.

1614
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:34,950
- 康纳先生 我必须...  - 噢 Minh 现在不行
- Mr.Cronauer, I must...  - Oh, Minh, not now.

1615
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,460
- 你必需告诉我你弟弟在哪里  - 不知道
- You gotta tell me where your brother is.  - I don't know.

1616
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:40,830
听着 他生命有危险 你必需告诉我他在哪里
Listen, his life is in danger. You gotta tell me where the hell he is.

1617
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,460
- 不 我不知道  - 胡说
- No, I don't know.  - Bullshit!

1618
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:46,300
听着 别再玩把戏了 好吗
Listen, no more games, okay?

1619
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,050
军方知道你弟弟的事
The Army knows about your brother.

1620
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:51,090
我也因为和他的关系而必需离开了
I have to leave the country because of my association with him.

1621
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:54,760
他们有他的照片 找到他的话 会杀了他
They have pictures of him. If they find him, they will shoot him.

1622
01:43:54,930 --> 01:43:57,560
如你还想要弟弟活着的话 现在就带我去
If you wanna continue to have a brother, you take me to him now!

1623
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:04,630
端
Tuan.

1624
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:12,590
泛德多
Phan Duc Tho!

1625
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:18,310
留在这
Get back here!

1626
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:22,370
爆炸的事我知道了 聪明小子
I know about the bombings, Sparky.

1627
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,910
难怪你能大难不死
No wonder you hauled ass.

1628
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:34,550
你是我的朋友
You were my friend.

1629
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:39,100
我信任你
I trusted you.

1630
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,680
你听见了吗
You hear me?

1631
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,310
你是位天真的人 康纳 你选了愚笨那边
You naive man, Cronauer. You take a stupid side.

1632
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:52,480
现在你要走了 这样也好
Now you have to go. It's better off.

1633
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:55,650
重点不在此
That's not the fucking point!

1634
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:58,200
你了解吗
You understand me?

1635
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:04,250
我为了你能进那酒吧而打架 你却把那酒吧给炸了
I fought to get you into that bar, and then you blow the fucking place up!

1636
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,960
听着
Listen.
