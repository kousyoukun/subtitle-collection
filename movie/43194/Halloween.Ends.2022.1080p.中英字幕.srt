你知道，明年春天，

16
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,210
你应该考虑一些常绿植物

21
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,300
我今年在攒钱，明年秋季班就能去了

44
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,700
去年万圣节，发生了那么多
Since last Halloween-- all the events and,

45
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,200
关于迈克尔·迈尔斯的头条
you know, the headlines of Michael Myers--

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,040
杰里米就一直怕黑
Jeremy's been afraid of the dark.

47

他晚上会尿床
He's been wetting the bed at night.

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,040
而且，睡眠困难
And, um, bedtime has been difficult.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,460
我能听见你在说我
I can hear you

50
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,170
我可以给他读个故事什么的
Uh, I can read him a story or something.

51
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,880
他有最喜欢的书吗?-他睡觉了以后
-Does he have a favorite book? -Then once he goes to bed,

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,470
会说梦话
he talks in his sleep.

53
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,930
他说他能听到某种声音
Says he hears voices.

54
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,720
他对那些可以引起做噩梦的事情
He's just really sensitive to things

55
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,550
特别敏感 -你说的听起来
-that give him bad dreams. -Right. All that just sounds

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,430
像绝大多数孩子想象出来的东西一样，对吧?
like normal kid imagination stuff, right?

57
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,270
不要看电视，不要给他吃糖
-No TV and no more candy.

58
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,110
你们可以玩到八点半或八点三刻
You guys can play till 8:30, 8:45.

59
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,440
然后就让他睡觉了
Then he should go to bed.

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,280
这钱好赚 -是的
-Easy money. -Yes.

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,360
你要不要跟我一起玩?
Gonna come play with me or what?

62
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,450
- 听着像吓我一样
-That sounds like a threat.

63
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,240
今天是万圣节
It's Halloween.

64
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,580
今晚我们会玩得很开心的
We're gonna have a good time tonight.

65
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,210
听着，小伙 -如果你害怕看怪物电影，
-Look, man, we can

66
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,420
我们可以把电视机关掉
shut it off if you're scared of monster movies.

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,630
不，不，你才害怕
No. No. You're scared.

68
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,010
我都21岁了 我才不会害怕
I'm 21 years old. I don't get scared.

69
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,220
你害怕是因为你知道迈克尔·迈尔斯
You're scared because you know Michael Myers is...

70
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,180
还活着
still out there.

71
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,560
他会抓到你的
Boogeyman's gonna get you.

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,770
他才不会
He's not gonna get me.

73
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,730
迈克尔·迈尔斯喜欢杀的是保姆，而不是孩子
Michael Myers kills babysitters, not kids.

74
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,950
好吧，这画面真的很恶心
Okay, that's actually pretty disgusting

75
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,950
不适合孩子
and probably not appropriate for kids.

76
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,620
为什么我们不关掉它，然后…
Why don't we shut this off, and...

77
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,040
我们可以在睡觉前玩捉迷藏
we can play hide-and-seek before bed.

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,620
你父母马上就回来了…
Your parents are gonna be home soon and...

79
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,620
我不想玩捉迷藏
I don't want to play no hide-and-seek.

80
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,000
捉迷藏好蠢的 我想看这部电影
It's stupid. I want to watch this movie.

81
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,500
我也不想假装和一个男保姆
And I don't really feel like pretending to be best friends

82
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,800
做好朋友
with an ugly-ass boy babysitter.

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,640
好吧，五分钟，然后你就去睡觉
Okay, five minutes, and then you're going to bed.

84
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,970
你还真不擅长照看孩子
You suck at babysitting.

85
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,520
我不是保姆
I'm not a babysitter.

86
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,300
杰里米
Jeremy

87
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,550
把那部电影关掉
Turn that movie off

88
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,060
杰里米?
Jeremy?

89
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,060
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

90
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,490
杰里米?
Jeremy?

91
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,310
杰里米
Jeremy

92
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,640
杰里米?
Jeremy?

93
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,190
出来吧，出来吧，不管你在哪里
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,080
这不好笑，杰里米
This isn't funny, Jeremy.

95
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,080
杰里米
Jeremy

96
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,690
杰里米?
Jeremy?

97
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,870
救命 科里,救命
Help  Corey, help

98
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,110
杰里米?
Jeremy?

99
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,620
杰里米?
Jeremy?

100
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,960
杰里米?
Jeremy?

101
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,760
他会抓到你的
He's gonna get you

102
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,260
他会在你最意想不到的时候抓住你
He's gonna get you when you least expect it.

103
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,520
-是你睡觉的时候了，科里? -好吧,杰里米……
- Is it your bedtime, Corey? -Okay, Jeremy...

104
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,570
“出来，出来，不管你在哪里”
"Come out, come out, wherever you are."

105
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,570
被你抓到了，伙计，好吧，放我出去
You got me, buddy. Okay, let me out.

106
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,030
-你害怕吗? -好吗?
- Are you scared? -Okay?

107
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,950
“我21岁我不害怕”
"I'm 21. I'm not scared."

108
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,320
杰里米，放我出去 让我出去
Jeremy, let me out. Let me out

109
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,620
你这个小混蛋 放我出去
You little shit  Let me out of here

110
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,120
迈克尔·迈尔斯
Michael Myers.

111
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,210
-杰里米，这不好笑，好吗?-
-Jeremy, it's not funny, okay? -

112
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,130
你会让我们都有麻烦的
Hey, you're gonna get us both in trouble.

113
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,800
让我出去 让我出去
Let me out Let me out Let me out

114
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
你这个小混蛋
You little shit

115
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,060
我要杀了你，杰里米
-I'm gonna kill you, Jeremy

116
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,600
-那是什么?
-What was that?

117
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,230
杰里米
Jeremy

118
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,320
-哦,不 哦,老天,不 杰里米
-Oh, no  Oh, God, no  Please  -Jeremy

119
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,780
-哦,不 -哦,老天 -杰里米
-Oh, no. Oh, God.  Jeremy

120
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,700
哦,我的老天 杰里米
Oh, my God  Jeremy

121
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,330
-杰里米-杰里米
- Jeremy. - Jeremy

122
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,120
老天,求求你,不
God, please, no

123
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,750
你做了什么?
What have you done?

124
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,190
哈顿菲尔德是一个宁静的小镇
Haddonfield was a peaceful town.

125
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,770
很多年前的一个万圣节之夜，
And then one Halloween night many years ago,

126
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,400
这一切都改变了
all of that was lost.

127
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,360
迈克尔·迈尔斯是个十足的恶魔
Michael Myers was pure evil.

128
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,700
他夺走了我们的梦想
He took our dreams

129
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,490
把它们变成了噩梦
and turned them into nightmares.

130
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,040
当他被关在监狱里的时候…
As he was locked away in his prison...

131
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,800
...我也消失在我的世界里
...I disappeared into mine.

132
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,310
然后，如我所料，
And then, as I predicted,

133
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,190
40年后，他逃了出来
40 years later, he escaped,

134
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,900
哈顿菲尔德再次被迫面对
and Haddonfield was once again forced to confront

135
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,980
这个戴面具的人
this man in a mask.

136
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,910
他毫无理性的暴行蹂躏了我们的社区
His senseless brutality ravaged my community...

137
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
...还杀了我女儿
...and killed my daughter.

138
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,300
然后他就消失了
And then he vanished.

139
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,840
不可能吗?
Impossible?

140
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,930
也许吧
Perhaps.

141
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,970
真相会演变成传说
Truth would evolve into legend

142
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,390
当人们寻找动机和意义的时候
as people searched for motive and meaning,

143
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,520
在暗处寻找这个恶魔
looking in the shadows for their boogeyman.

144
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,650
这是个意外
It was an accident.

145
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,280
在接下来的几年里，
In the years that followed,

146
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,240
哈顿菲尔德的人们陷入了瘟疫
the people of Haddonfield descended into a plague

147
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,660
悲伤，责备，偏执
of grief, of blame, of paranoia.

148
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,210
你认为他回来了吗?
Do you think he's come back?

149
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,040
迈克尔不用枪
Michael doesn't use guns.

150
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,710
迈克尔造成的痛苦
The suffering Michael caused

151
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,170
变成了传染给人类的传染病
became an infection passing on to people

152
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,220
从没见过他的人
who never even crossed his path.

153
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,800
当整个小镇都在自我封闭的时候，
And as the town turned in on itself,

154
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,890
我发誓不再让恐惧支配我的生活
I made a promise not to let fear rule my life anymore.

155
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,980
我买了一套房子
I bought a home.

156
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,480
一个充满爱和信任的地方
A place to live with love and trust.

157
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,900
没有陷阱
Not a trap.

158
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,110
不是藏身之处
Not a place to hide.

159
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,280
自从我最后一次见到那恶魔
It has been four years

160
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
已经过去四年了
since I last saw my monster.

161
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,790
所以我在此想以一个幸存者的视角分享我的故事
So here I am, a survivor attempting to share my story

162
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,290
并找到治愈
and find healing.

163
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,260
迈克尔·迈尔斯是恶魔的化身
Michael Myers was the personification of evil.

164
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,010
这是他们的
It's theirs.

165
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,270
他们的结婚戒指
It's their wedding rings.

166
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,650
这取决于我们每个人
It's up to each of us

167
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,860
不管我们锁不锁门
whether or not we lock the door

168
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,110
找到我们的决心…
and find our resolve...

169
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,530
...或者让他进来
...or let him inside.

170
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,420
让它进来
Let it inside.

171
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,510
让邪恶…
Let evil...

172
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,260
进来
inside.

173
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,890
阿廖沙 讨厌
Allyson  Darn it

174
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,650
-亲爱的，我很抱歉 -怎么回事?
-Honey, I'm so sorry  -What is it?

175
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,060
哦,
Oh, fuck

176
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,480
嗯，我的派，我把派放进烤箱
Um, it's my pie. I put a pie in the oven.

177
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,240
哦，妈蛋
Oh, shit

178
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,610
哦，我一定是忘记设置计时器了
Oh, I must have forgotten to set the timer.

179
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,320
该死的
Damn it

180
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,830
真讨厌 不，不，哦，不
Darn it  No, no, no, no, Oh, no.

181
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,490
我可以从店里买一个派
I can get a pie from the store.

182
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,080
不 我想给你烤个南瓜派
No  I wanted to bake you a pumpkin pie.

183
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,790
这是万圣节的传统
It's a Halloween tradition.

184
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,510
-你……-我得走了
-Are you... -I got to go.

185
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,090
-我上班要迟到了 -好的
-I'm late for work.  Okay.

186
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,050
你准备好参加派对的服装了吗?
But do you have your costume for the party?

187
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,100
我说了，我不想一个人去
I told you, I don't want to go alone.

188
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,930
所以我不去了
So I'm not going.

189
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,350
哦
Oh.

190
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,270
WURG 94.9
WURG 94.9.

191
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,280
给你鼓励 和威利小子一起
Giving you the Urge, with Willie the Kid.

192
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
哈顿菲尔德是摇滚者之家
Haddonfield's home for rock.

193
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,700
还有四天就是万圣节了
It is four days until Halloween.

194
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
-你能相信吗?
-Can you believe it?

195
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,450
是时候锁好你的门，拿起你的刀开始战斗了
It's time to lock your doors, grab your knife for the fight.

196
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,990
你准备好了吗? 你准备好和
You ready? You ready in case

197
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
恶魔出来玩了么?
the Boogeyman decides to come out and play?

198
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,670
我知道我准备好了
I know I am.

199
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,750
但我们还是来谈谈迈克尔·迈尔斯吧
But let's talk about that Michael Myers for a minute.

200
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,420
怎么会有一个人被枪击，被捅了之后
How does one man get shot at, stabbed up

201
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,260
从街上摔下来，然后又爬起来
and then he fall down the street and get back up

202
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,180
把哈顿菲尔德的人都吓尿了
to scare the piss out of everybody in Haddonfield?

203
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,800
我来告诉你是什么，因为它不是人
Let me tell you how-- 'cause this isn't a man.

204
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,680
不仅仅是人 他是野兽
This is more than a man. This is a beast.

205
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,520
一头不会流血的野兽...
One that doesn't bleed...

206
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,480
我确认更改订单
I'm pretty sure that was in the change order.

207
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,730
等一下，香侬
Hold-hold on a second, Shannon.

208
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,570
嘿，科里，你迟到了
Hey, Corey, you're late

209
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,530
你又迟到了
You're late again

210
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,570
已经四年了
It's been four years.

211
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,530
你们在哪里?
Where y'all at?

212
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,490
也许是在为这个大日子训练?
Training for the big day, perhaps?

213
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,570
进入状态了吗?
Getting yourself in the spirit?

214
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,620
这个恶魔一直在冬眠，
This Boogeyman been sitting in hibernation,

215
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,120
但相信我，他会回来的
but trust me, y'all, he'll be back.

216
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,040
我是威利小子，我要来真的
I'm Willie the Kid, and I'll be creeping it real

217
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,380
94.9 WUR…
on 94.9 WUR...

218
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,380
科里，你有空吗?
Corey, you got a second?

219
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,090
觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

220
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,760
不错
Yeah.

221
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,350
把它注册一下
Get it registered.

222
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,270
做新钣金
Get some new plates.

223
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,350
-我用不上了，送你 -真的吗?
-I got no use for it no more. -Are you serious?

224
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,520
有个好的引擎的推动下，你应该能
With a good engine pushing you, finally make it

225
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,690
准时上班了吧，你明白我的意思吗?
to work on time, you know what I mean?

226
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,190
还能开么?
Does it work?

227
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,320
当然可以，就是有点旧了
Yeah, it works, just kind of shitty.

228
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,950
嘿，罗纳德
Hey, uh, Ronald?

229
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,120
谢谢
Thanks.

230
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,870
不用谢，孩子
No problem, kid.

231
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,770
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

232
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,850
你是我认识的最漂亮的女孩
For being the prettiest girl I know.

233
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,190
真好,道格
That's nice, Doug.

234
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,570
所以你才让边停车吗?
Is that why you pulled me over?

235
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,070
不 我让你靠边停车 是因为我想你
No. I pulled you over 'cause I miss you.

236
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,530
你想我么?
You miss me?

237
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,070
只是开玩笑
Just kidding.

238
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,320
让你靠边停车，因为看起来
Pulled you over 'cause it looks like

239
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,740
你的引擎消音器坏了
your muffler's about to fall off.

240
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,240
最好在你遇到更大麻烦前
Better get that fixed before you have a bigger

241
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,540
把它修好
-problem on your hands.

242
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,330
你到底买不买?
You gonna buy something or what?

243
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,420
我本来可以开车来的
I could've drove here.

244
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,970
冷静，我可是代驾司机
Chill. I'm the designated driver.

245
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,340
-我知道怎么开车-请不要弄坏我的车
-I know how to drive. -Don't mess up my car, please.

246
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,800
-我不会弄坏你的车-对吗?
-I'm not gonna mess up your car. -All right?

247
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,640
-别搞砸了 别激动
-Don't mess it up. -Chill.

248
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,260
他的爸爸是……-我拿到驾照了
-His dad is... -I got my license.

249
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,350
这不是拉仇恨来的吧
It's no hating on. Come on.

250
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,640
比利 身份证呢? -计划是什么?

-I told you. -She's got the money.

254
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,820
-你没带身份证? -等一下 你什么?
-You don't have your I.D.? -Wait. You what?

255
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,030
等等 -等一下 -嘿,你 我失去了它
-Wait. Hold on. Hey, yo  -I lost it.

259
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,330
-听着，事情是这样的，伙计
-Look, here's the deal, man.

260
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,040
我们高三学生
We're seniors, okay?

261
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,330
我们一整年都在为今晚的比赛
We've been practicing for our show the whole year, you know.

262
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,330

我们是行军乐队的一员
Well, we're in the fucking marching band.

264
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,300
我们希望一个很酷的新朋友
We were just hoping you could be a cool new friend, you know.

265

-I know who you are. -You did something messy.

-哦,是的-想起来了
-Oh, yeah. -Yeah.

274
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,030
你就是那个变态保姆
You're that psycho babysitter.

275
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,320
他杀了那个孩子，是吗?
He killed that kid, didn't he?

276
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,990
是的 -杀了个孩子，娘炮
-Yep. -Killed a kid and too pussy

277
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,370
-给我们买点啤酒？ 伙计们，你们知道吗？
-to buy us some fucking beer?  Guys, you know what?

278
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,620
让我们忘了这事吧
Let's just fucking forget about it.

279
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,040
我们去看比赛吧，好吗?
Let's just go to the game, okay?

280
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,620
-你只是个小角色 -看看他
-You're just a little pedo. -Look at him.

281
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
-告诉他，特里 -你是什么东西
-Let him know, Terry. -That what you are?

282
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,910
一个微不足道的变态
A little fucking pedo creep?

283
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,370
-是 -到他面前去，特里
-That's right. -Get in his face, Terry.

284
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,960
你他妈算哪门子照顾孩子?
What kind of fucked-up kid are you?

285
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,750
-对 -对 -你下一个受害者是谁?
-That's right. -Right. -So where's your next victim?

286
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,840
-啊 什么?
-Whoa  -What the fuck?

287
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,840
你在开玩笑吗，伙计?
Are you kidding me, man?

288
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,210
-哦,妈蛋
- Oh, shit.

289
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,470
-看看你 什么鬼，特里?
-Look at you.  What the fuck, Terry?

290
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,890
到处都是牛奶
Got fucking milk everywhere.

291
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,600
-卧槽-看看你做了什么
Holy shit. -Look what you did.

292
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,140
嘿 混蛋
Hey  Assholes

293
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,730
住嘴
Knock it off

294
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,890
-我们什么都没做-我们只是谈谈，小姐
-We're not doing anything. -We're just talking, miss.

295
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,730
我们就是弄脏了这里 女士
-We're messing around. -Ma'am.

296
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,480
嘿,家伙
Hey, guys.

297
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,730
你能看看这个吗?
Would you look at this?

298
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,440
我是说，一个疯子遇上了畸形人
I mean, a psycho meets a freak show.

299
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,780
-哇 -不敢相信
-Wow. -Can't believe it.

300
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,400
你们真是天作之合
This is a match made in heaven.

301
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,150
-嘿,来吧 -看着我 -大大泡泡糖
-Hey, come on. Look at me. -Ta-ta for now.

302
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,610
我们走吧,你们
Let's go, y'all.

303
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,410
迈克尔·迈尔斯
Michael Myers.

304
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,080
你是疯子还是怪胎?
Are you the psycho or the freak show?

305
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,920
嘿，星期六你想去看学校的演出吗? ?
Hey, , do you want to go to the school play on Saturday?

306
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,750
是的,当然,特里-有趣
Yeah, sure, Terry. -Have fun.

307
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,930
所以，是你自己来，还是我来?
So, do you want to do it, or you want me to?

308
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,110
看一下
Look at it.

309
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,110
你在开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding?

310
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,320
你穿起来很好看
It looks great on you.

311
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,030
我知道，但我不会去的
I'm sure it does, but I'm not going.

312
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,950
你穿上整套衣服，你会喜欢的
Once you put the whole outfit on, you'll love it.

313
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,240
要我说穿得不性感就不算过万圣节了
I say if it's not sexy, it's not Halloween.

314
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,910
好吧 看来有人已经进了状态了
Well, someone's getting into the spirit of things.

315
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,790
这位先生出了点意外，需要看一下
This gentleman had an accident and needs a little fix-up.

316
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,920
你有严重的炎症
You have significant inflammation.

317
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,130
我要麻醉一下这里
Um, I'm gonna be nice and numb it here

318
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,300
我的助手会把它清理好，
so my assistant can clean it up really well,

319
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,680
然后我再回来缝合伤口
and then I will get back and close it with a suture.

320
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,520
你会觉得有点刺痛
You're gonna feel a little bit of a pinch here.

321
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,150
她很可爱,是吗?
Cute, isn't she?

322
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,480
我不是,噢
I don't-- Ow

323
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,320
老天 -对不起 -对不起
-Jesus Christ  - Sorry. Sorry.

324
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,900
我很抱歉 我很抱歉-艾莉森，你在干什么?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Allyson, what are you doing?

325
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,280
这是我的错 对不起 阿廖沙
It's my fault. Sorry. -Allyson

326
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,400
-不-对不起,对不起
-No. - Sorry, sorry.

327
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,150
不 不,我的错 这是我的错
No. No, my fault. It was my fault.

328
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,990
我很抱歉 -哦,天啊-真是一团糟
-I-I'm so sorry. Oh, geez. - What a mess.

329
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,450
把它清理干净，拿个该死的消毒包
Just clean it up and get a goddamn sterile kit.

330
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,040
给他打一针破伤风针
And give him a tetanus shot.

331
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,040
我马上就回来
I'll be back.

332
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,510
不该让那家伙那样跟你说话
You shouldn't let that guy talk to you like that.

333
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,760
这会让你难过的，即使你不这么认为
It's gonna make you sad, even if you don't think it does.

334
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,640
我处理过更糟糕的
I've dealt with much worse.

335
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,020
但是谢谢你
But thank you.

336
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,520
总之，我一直在处理这种事
Anyway, I've just been dealing with it.

337
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,770
我本该得到升职的
Well, I'm supposed to get this promotion.

338
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,570
-但不管怎样，这只是…-值得吗?
-But either way, it's just... -Is it worth it?

339
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,530
做什么了?
What'd you do?

340
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,240
-嗯……-你的手
-Uh... -To your hand?

341
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,740
我在工作，然后出了点小意外
Uh, I was at work, and then I had a little accident.

342
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,700
-所以 你的工作也很糟糕嗯?
-So your job sucks, too. -Hmm?

343
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,460
你在哪里工作?你做什么的?
Where do you work? What do you do?

344
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,870
修理店 -不要移动
Oh, a mechanic shop. -Don't move.

345
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,540
-不想被感染
-Don't want to get infected.

346
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,210
我的车一直响个不停
So my car's been rattling.

347
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,920
活泼的吗?-是的
-Rattling? -Yeah.

348
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,170
只是你的排气系统夹松了
Uh, it's just your exhaust system clamp's come loose.

349
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,970
这很容易解决大概需要五分钟
It's an easy fix. It takes like five minutes.

350
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,010
超级cinchy
Super cinchy.

351
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,770
你只需要一个升降机和两个螺丝
You just need a lift and two screws.

352
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,930
“Cinchy”?
"Cinchy"?

353
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,390
你不用现在就去修
You don't have to fix it right now.

354
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,770
是的，我没带我的东西，但是…
Yeah, I don't have my stuff, but...

355
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,980
我明天在商店
I am at the shop tomorrow.

356
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,190
那时我可以修好它
I can fix it then.

357
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,570
为什么自行车不能自己站起来?
Why can't the bicycle stand on its own?

358
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,070
不,不它可以
No, no. It can.

359
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,610
它有一个支架
It's got a kickstand.

360
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,410
因为它太累了
'Cause it was too tired.

361
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,040
是的
Yeah.

362
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,040
其实我要把自行车扔了，
Oh, I'm actually getting rid of the bike,

363
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
所以如果你想要，就给你
so if you want it, you can have it.

364
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,590
我有一辆摩托车
I got a motorcycle.

365
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,380
-哦,一辆摩托车吗?-是的
-Oh, a motorcycle? -Yeah.

366
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,630
教我骑?
Teach me to ride it?

367
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,300
是的
Yeah.

368
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,600
你背上有屎
You have shit on your back.

369
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,470
我将得到它
I'll get it.

370
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,270
我们应该找个时间出去做点什么
We should go out sometime and do something.

371
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,520
-我吗?-和我们两个一起
-With me? -With both of us.

372
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,940
我是说，我们两个都得去
I mean, we'd both have to be there.

373
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,440
否则，这不是一个很好的时间
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a very good time.

374
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,860
是啊，你不会想这么做的
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

375
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,080
我晚饭要迟到了
Uh, I'm gonna be late for dinner.

376
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,330
但是，我很感谢你的帮助
But, uh, I appreciate the hand.

377
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,580
感觉已经好多了
It feels better already.

378
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,460
所以你是故意的
So you did that on purpose.

379
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,460
什么?
What?

380
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,840
他受伤了,
He was injured,

381
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,630
他需要治疗，而马西斯医生
he needed medical attention, and Dr. Mathis

382
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,050
是城里最好的-你相信她吗?
-is the best in town. -Do you believe her?

383
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,760
-她说的话一个字也不要信-
-Do not believe a word she says. -

384
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,390
-你知道，她是个战略家-在,好,好
-You know, she's a strategist. -Fine, fine, fine.

385
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,640
她只是想扮演丘比特
She's just trying to play Cupid.

386
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,550
我觉得他很可爱似乎不错
Thought he was cute. Seemed nice.

387
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
你会给他打电话吗
Are you gonna call him

388
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
邀请他参加她的派对
and invite him to her party,

389
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,060
还是你要一个人去?
or you gonna just go alone?

390
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,730
现在选一张牌毫米
Now pick a card. Mm

391
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,190
哦,不我拿到死亡牌了
Oh, no. I got the death card.

392
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,980
-不，塔罗牌还不错-毫米毫米
-No, that's not bad in tarot. - Mm-mm.

393
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,860
不，那只是意味着一个重要阶段结束了
No, that just means a major phase is ending

394
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,280
新的一段就要开始了
and a new one is about to begin.

395
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,820
所以，这几乎是在棺材上钉了一颗钉子
So, that pretty much puts a nail in the coffin

396
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,990
和你约会的那个警官
with that police officer you were dating.

397
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,780
啊,道格
-Ugh, Doug.

398
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,290
你得找个能放手的人
You know, you need to find someone that can let go.

399
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,290
这让你想扯掉你的衬衫
That makes you want to rip off your shirt

400
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,750
露出你那该死的奶子，说，
and show grief your fucking tits and say,

401
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,750
“你知道吗?我们走吧”
"You know what? Let's go."

402
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,710
这是美味的
This is delicious.

403
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,170
科里它感染了吗?
Corey. Is it infected?

404
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,050
你的手感染了吗?医生怎么说?
Is your hand infected? What did the doctor say?

405
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,510
他说会没事的，妈妈
He said it's gonna be fine, Mama.

406
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,970
他说你不用担心，
He said that you don't need to worry,

407
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,680
他说会很棒的，这是他说的
and he said it would be terrific is what he said.

408
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,510
我可能得把他送回呼叫中心了
Well, I just might have to send him back to the call center

409
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,180
为戴文工作，如果你不能给他适当的监督
to work for DeVon if you can't give him proper supervision.

410

00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,690
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

551
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,110
你不好意思吗?哦
You're sorry? Oh.

552
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,280
抱歉?抱歉杀了我儿子?
Sorry? Sorry for killing my son?

553
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,450
我每天醒来，
I wake up every day,

554
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,620
我无法摆脱痛苦
and I can't get past the pain.

555
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,910
它杀死我你明白吗?
It kills me. Do you understand?

556
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,410
你以为你能来这里-
You think you can come here--

557
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,250
不，如果你认为你可以来这里，你就不明白
No, you don't understand if you think you can come here

558
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,620
把你的小面具摘下来
and take off your little mask

559
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,630
祝你和朋友们玩得愉快
and have a good time with your friends.

560
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,420
法官可能会说你是无辜的，但我了解你
A judge might have said you're innocent, but I know you.

561
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,090
我知道这不是意外
I know it was no accident.

562
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,420
这不是意外
It was no accident

563
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,550
你推我儿子是因为你生气了，
You pushed my little boy because you got mad,

564
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,430
你他妈疯了
and you lost your fucking mind

565
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,140
无辜的人不会这么做 不
Innocent people don't do that  No

566
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,640
邪恶的人
Evil people do.

567
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,060
邪恶的
Evil.

568
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,440
科里
Corey

569
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,570
科里,小心 科里
Corey, watch out  Corey

570
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,990
科里
Corey

571
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,450
停止跟我说话-你为什么带我进去?
-Stop. Talk to me. -Why'd you take me in there?

572
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,200
这就是我不出门的原因
It's why I don't go out.

573
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,330
-什么?你,你……
-What? -You just, you...

574
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,160
你把我扔到中间，然后你…
you threw me in the middle of it, and then you...

575
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,460
-我…我…-你是在哪里?
-I... I... -Where were you?

576
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,750
我不知道里面发生了什么
I didn't know what was happening in there.

577
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,210
我只是想，我只是想帮你…
I-I was just trying, I was just trying to help you to just...

578
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,380
我不是你的项目，艾莉森
I'm not your fucking project, Allyson

579
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,260
我只是科里，我知道
I just-- Corey, I know

580
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,470
好吧?我知道那是什么感觉
Okay? I know what it's like to have

581
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,470
每个人看着你，以为他们认识你，
everybody looking at you, thinking that they know you,

582
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,270
以为他们知道你经历了什么，
thinking that they know what you've been through,

583
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,600
但他们没有
but they don't.

584
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,940
但当我看着你，那天我看到你的时候，
But when I look at you-- when I saw you the other day,

585
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,480
我只看到一个人
I just saw a person.

586
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,940
只是一个想要搞清楚的人
Just a person just trying to figure it the fuck out.

587
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,320
试着每天醒来不再害怕，不再孤单
Trying to wake up every day not scared and alone.

588
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,410
但你我之间的区别，艾莉森
But the difference, Allyson, between me and you

589
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,910
人们看着我就像，
is that people look at me like,

590
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,250
“这家伙是谁?”这个怪物是谁?”
"Who is this guy? Who is this monster?"

591
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,420
他们看着你就像他们把你当成幸存者
And they look at you like-- They see you like a survivor.

592
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,840
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

593
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,590
我明白了你从迈克尔·迈尔斯那里逃了出来
I get it. You survived Michael Myers.

594
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,180
你是奋斗的英雄，去问别人吧
You're a hero with your struggles, and ask anyone.

595
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,970
我是那个神经病保姆我就是那个该死的孩子杀手
I'm the psycho babysitter. I'm the fucking kid killer.

596
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,600
你以为你能治好我，但你不能
And you think you can fix me, but you can't.

597
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,850
我不会让你心痛的
I'll spare you the heartache.

598
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,420
科里
Corey

599
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,880
嘿,很酷的孩子有什么事吗?
Hey, cool kid. What's up?

600
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,510
你要去哪里?
Where you going?

601
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,930
你在这啊，伙计我一直在找你
There you are, man. I've been looking for you.

602
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,390
特里-我想道歉，好吗?
Terry. -I want to apologize, okay?

603
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,720
呃,耶稣基督
Ugh, Jesus Christ.

604
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
科里，你怎么看?嗯?
So what do you say, Corey? Huh?

605
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,930
这个怎么样?握手和友谊
How about this? Handshakes and friendship.

606
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,020
别把他晾着，伙计
Don't leave him hanging, dude.

607
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,950
你对这孩子有什么意见?
What is your problem with this kid?

608
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,080
这家伙搞砸了勒巴伦地狱-是的
This guy fucked up the LeBaron. - Hell yeah.

609
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
-一元店设计师框架?
-Dollar store designer frames?

610
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,040
哦
Oops.

611
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,790
嘿，让我扶你起来来吧
Hey, let me help you up. Come on.

612
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,750
对不起你都好吗?
-Sorry. -Are you okay?

613
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,210
哇哇给我滚回去
Whoa. Whoa.  Get the fuck back

614
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,420
-嘿 嘿 -回来
-Hey  Hey  -Get back

615
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,760
-回来 -啊哇哇
-Get back  -Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

616
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,510
我只是想帮忙-回来
I'm just trying to help. -Get back

617
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,300
你要杀了我们?和你杀那孩子的方法一样吗?
You gonna murder us? Same way you killed that kid?

618
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,350
你这个小神经病
You little psycho bitch.

619
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,930
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about

620
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,810
-你不知道你在说什么-
-You don't know what you're talking about. -

621
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,440
你就像个混蛋
You just act like a goddamn asshole

622
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,940
因为你父亲把你当孩子看
because your father treats you like one.

623
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,940
这是会传染的,对吧?
It's contagious, right?

624
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,190
妈蛋
Shit.

625
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,780
-你刚才对我说什么?-是对的
-What did you just say to me? -That's right.

626
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,780
我知道有人恨你是什么样子
I know what it looks like when somebody hates you.

627
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,900
你爸爸讨厌你
And your father fucking hates you.

628
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,240
嗯?他讨厌我吗?
-Hmm? He hates me?

629
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,620
比利-他恨我，是吗?
Billy. -He hates me, huh?

630
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,700
-他讨厌我，对吧?-嘿
-He hates me, right? -Hey

631
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,620
比利，别吵了比利
Billy, knock it off. Billy

632
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,000
他讨厌我吗?
-He hates me?

633
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,750
特里，搞什么鬼?
Terry, what the fuck?

634
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,920
-哦,妈蛋
-Oh, shit

635
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,000
-哦,妈蛋哦,我的老天
- Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.

636
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,840
-哦,妈蛋-特里，你做了什么?
-Oh, shit. -Terry, what did you do?

637
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,130
他摔倒了-小混蛋把它弄坏了
-He fell. -Little dick busted it.

638
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,970
他死了吗?-下去看看
Is he dead? - Go down and look.

639
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,140
-不，你下去看看-?
-No, you go down and look. -What the fuck?

640
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,510
我没有推任何人他摔倒了
I didn't push nobody. He fell.

641
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,600
废话他了吗?
-Bullshit. -He fell?

642
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,140
是的，这就是我的故事
Yeah, that's my story.

643
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,140
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

644
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,440
现在谁是疯子，特里?谁是神经病?
Who's the psycho now, Terry? Who's the psycho?

645
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,650
小混蛋活该
Little prick deserved it.

646
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,980
快上车
Get in the car, .

647
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,270
我们杀了一个孩子
We killed a kid, man.

648
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,980
来吧
Come on.

649
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,850
嘿,发生了什么?
Hey, what's happening?

650
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,100
只是，这该死的东西我打不起来
Just-- I can't get this fucking thing to turn on.

651
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,770
好吧,好吧换气
Okay, okay. Take a breath.

652
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,690
-好的，深呼吸-让我生气吧
-Okay, take a deep breath. -Just let me be mad

653
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,690
为什么我不能生气?
Why can't I be mad?

654
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,440
你可以
-You can.

655
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,030
你可以生气
You can be mad.

656
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,740
-你会非常非常生气，-(微波炉哔哔声)
-You can be very, very mad, -(microwave beeping)

657
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,360
你可以打碎东西
and you can smash things.

658
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,370
只是小心些而已这是上瘾
Just be careful. It's addictive.

659
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,300
你是对的
You were right.

660
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,590
我喜欢他
I liked him.

661
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,380
是的
Yeah.

662
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,810
-你看到里面那个人了吗?-

663
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,730
他时不时带人进去
He take people in there now and then.

664
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,740
他为什么让你活着?
Why'd he let you live?

665
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,990
我建议你回去
I say you go back.

666
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,200
你回去把面具给我拿来
You go back in there, and you get me that mask.

667
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,490
我是迈克尔·迈尔斯
I'm Michael Myers.

668
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,960
-操吗?-
-The fuck? -

669
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,580
他还没完呢，你个小混蛋
He not done with you, you little fuck.

670
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,660
嘿
Hey

671
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,960
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

672
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,130
我担心死了
I have been worried sick

673
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,090
科里，我差点打给失踪人口处了
Corey, I almost called the missing persons.

674
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,970
-你怎么了?
-What is going on with you?

675
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,300
科里，我在跟你说话呢
Corey, I'm talking to you.

676
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,140
她一点都不好，该死的
She's no good, damn it.

677
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,720
开门
Open the door.

678
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,680
-开放的大门
-Open the door

679
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,100
你想杀了我吗?
Are you trying to kill me?

680
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,440
科里?科里?
Corey? Corey?

681
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,670
你对升职没什么不满吧?
No hard feelings about the promotion, right?

682
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,130
当然不是这是你应得的
Course not. You deserve it.

683
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,000
我以为马西斯医生没问题
I thought for sure Dr. Mathis

684
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,960
本打算让你当护士长
was gonna make you the charge nurse.

685
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,760
黛布，我能跟你说句话吗?
Deb, can I speak to you a minute?

686
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,140
好吧，黛比，我只告诉你一次…
Okay, Deb, I'm gonna tell you once...

687
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,730
人们创造自己的故事
People create their own stories

688
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,820
做出他们自己的选择
and make their own choices.

689
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,610
他们相信他们想相信的
They believe what they want to believe.

690
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,160
我满怀希望，有远见，
I'm hopeful, with perspective,

691
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,200
我的经历能帮助别人疗伤
that my experience will help others heal.

692
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,790
你得问问自己，我能控制吗，
You have to ask yourself, "Am I in control,

693
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,340
还是大自然控制了我?
"or do the elements control me?

694
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,090
“生命或死亡
"Life or death.

695
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,430
要么自杀，要么开樱花”
Suicide or cherry blossoms."

696
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,090
-你好-
-Hi. -

697
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,500
对不起，我不是故意吓你的
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

698
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,130
我在等艾莉森
I'm just waiting for Allyson.

699
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:23,470
科里?
Corey?

700
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,260
一切都好吗?
Everything okay?

701
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,600
我昨晚在回家的路上被袭击了
Uh, I got jumped on the way home last night.

702
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,850
这些家伙…
These guys...

703
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,240
加油站的那些孩子在耍我
Those kids from the gas station that were messing with me--

704
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,280
我试着为自己辩护，但他们…
I tried to stand up for myself, and they, um...

705
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,280
哦,我很抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

706
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,960
我来只是想和你谈谈
I just came 'cause I wanted to talk to you.

707
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,210
我想说我很抱歉，还有…
I wanted to say that I'm sorry and there's...

708
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,460
没有借口
no excuse.

709
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,590
但如果你能，求你了，如果你能
But if you could, please, if you could just

710
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,670
和我一起去散步
take a walk with me.

711
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,800
好吗?
Please?

712
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,990
我杀了一个人
I killed someone.

713
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,000
我们在做纸飞机，
We were making paper planes,

714
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,830
但他想看一部怪兽电影
but he wanted to watch a monster movie.

715
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,630
一切都发生得太快了
Everything happened so fast.

716
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,390
我只想过个有趣的夜晚
I just wanted it to be a fun night.

717
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,930
的,只是……一个晚安
That's all, just... a good night.

718
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,440
然后一切都变糟了
And then it all went bad.

719
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,610
我听说发生了什么事
I heard what happened.

720
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,240
我知道这听起来很疯狂，但是当…
I know it sounds crazy, but when...

721
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,950
人们会谈论它，就好像我认识你一样
people would talk about it, it was like I knew you.

722
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,330
就像我在找你一样
Like I was looking for you.

723
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,580
然后她带你来见我
And then she brought you to me.

724
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,130
(高音吹口哨)
(high-pitched whistling)

725
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,010
他做了什么坏事吗?
Has he done something bad?

726
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,470
我不明白你为什么在这里
I don't understand why you're here.

727
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,260
不,不他在看我的孙女
No, no. He's seeing my granddaughter.

728
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,060
其实是我介绍的
I introduced them, actually.

729
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,890
你的孙女应该很幸运
Your granddaughter should be so lucky

730
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,730
和科里这样的男孩在一起
as to be with a boy like Corey.

731
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,020
他很帅他是敏感的
He's handsome. He's sensitive.

732
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,070
我不喜欢他呆在外面
I don't like it when he stays out

733
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,940
夜夜笙歌，但他长大了
all night with girls, but he's grown.

734
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,280
他可以做他想做的事
He can do what he wants.

735
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,070
是的
Yes.

736
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,580
我知道他有他的困难
I know he's had his difficulties.

737
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,790
我的儿子
My son.

738
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,210
整个镇子都反对他
This town turned against him

739
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,920
在杰里米·艾伦出事之后
after the accident with Jeremy Allen.

740
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,340
他们会同情他的
They would've felt for him.

741
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,710
他们会帮助他痊愈的
They would've helped him heal.

742
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,590
但因为你的恶魔消失了
But because your boogeyman disappeared,

743
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,630
他们需要一个新的
they needed a new one.

744
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,640
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

745
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,690
我父母被杀后，
After my mom and dad were killed,

746
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,940
我只想把这一切都付之一炬
I just wanted to burn it all to the ground

747
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,440
离哈顿菲尔德远点-为什么不离开呢?
-and get away from Haddonfield. -Why not leave?

748
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,110
为什么留下来吗?
Why stay?

749
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,610
我所有的记忆都在这里
All my memories are here.

750
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,160
我觉得你父母都被杀了
I think both your parents got killed

751
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,950
你奶奶为此感到内疚，
and your grandma feels guilty about it,

752
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,410
所以她要让你成为她的孩子
so she's making you her child.

753
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,620
如果你能在治疗前见她一面，
If you could've seen her before therapy,

754
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,620
清醒了，而我…
sobering up, and me...

755
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,380
我只是害怕会发生什么事
I'm just terrified to think what would happen

756
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,130
如果她孤身一人如果我走了
if she were all alone if I left.

757
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,050
所以呢，你得留在这里，保护她
So, what, you got to stay here, protect her

758
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,630
从自己到永远吗?
from herself forever?

759
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,590
看起来……
Look...

760
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,010
很抱歉我在聚会上失去了理智
I'm sorry I lost my head at the party

761
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,140
我走开了
and I walked away.

762
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,100
这是一个错误
That was a mistake.

763
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,520
当我看着你，我…
When I look at you, I...

764
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,150
我知道我可以告诉你真相
I know I can tell you the truth.

765
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,320
我不怕这些人
I'm not afraid of these people.

766
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,490
我不再害怕了
I'm not afraid anymore.

767
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,660
你说你想把它烧了，
You tell me that you want to burn it down,

768
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,580
或者你告诉我你想把它烧为平地
or you tell me you want to burn it to the ground.

769
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,830
嘿一周两次

You were... you were gonna call, but you didn't call.

773
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,090
不，我欠你一个电话
No, I owe you a call.

774
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,300
我是……我做错什么了吗?
Did I... did I do something wrong or...

775
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,720
我与某人
I'm with someone.

776
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,380
哦哦
Oh. Oh.

777

对不起，打扰你了

Well, um, you know, it's, uh... it's Joe Grillo's, uh...

And Joe Ross, uh, he made a sponge cake.

783
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,730
你们俩想过来吃点东西吗
You two want to stop by, get a slice

784
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,110
-在你们做了什么之后?我们很好
-after whatever you guys are doing? -We're good.

785
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,940
哦好的,你很好

让我告诉你，这…

她说我们和好了

所以你打电话给故意杀人罪先生

晚上睡不着的时候?

795
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,310
当你在噩梦中看到恶魔的时候?

796
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,640
和他在一起你觉得安全吗?

00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,110
迈克尔·迈尔斯让你活下来了吗?
Did Michael Myers let you live?

830
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,030
还是你逃跑了?
Or did you escape?

831
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,660
(颤抖的呼吸)
(trembling breaths)

832
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,960
疼吗?
Does it hurt?

833
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,710
不不
No. No.

834
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,630
我妈妈救了我
My mother saved me.

835
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,890
你和他上床了，是吗?
You're fucking him, aren't you?

836
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,900
从某种程度上来说，这是哈顿菲尔德的完美故事
It's, like, the perfect story of Haddonfield in a way.

837
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,900
可爱的小女孩爱上了当地的流氓
Cute young girl falls for local creep.

838
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,270
想象一下，如果你的祖母有
Imagine if your grandmother had

839
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,280
爱上了迈克尔·迈尔斯
fallen in love with Michael Myers.

840
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,860
但她没有我听说她捅了他
But she didn't. I heard she stabbed him

841
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,400
脖子上被针织针扎了
in the neck with a fucking knitting needle.

842
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,740
你怎么了，黛布?
What's your problem, Deb?

843
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,200
你跟我说话就像我不存在一样
You talk to me like I'm not even here.

844
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,620
你就不能闭上你的臭嘴吗?
Do you ever just shut your goddamn mouth?

845
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,750
我知道,对吧?
I know, right?

846
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,410
我知道我说得太多了
I know I talk too much.

847
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,630
我只是对那些鬼东西太兴奋了
I just get so excited about all that Boogeyman bullshit.

848
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,090
嗯不我要否决这笔交易
Uh-uh. No. I-I'm vetoing that trade.

849
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,590
马克防守最后一名时的第二接球手
Your second receiver for Mark's last-place defense

850
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,090
勾结的味道
reeks of collusion.

851
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,510
这不是一个直接的交换
It's not a straight-up swap.

852
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,510
你想用水准赢得冠军吗?
You want to win the championship with class?

853
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:02,970
停止欺骗
Stop cheating.

854
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,850
停止欺骗
Stop cheating.

855
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,730
我一直看到他的眼睛
I keep seeing his eyes.

856
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,600
我们是在说迈克尔还是这孩子?
Are we talking about Michael or this kid?

857
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,690
迈克尔的眼睛盯着科里
Michael's eyes in Corey.

858
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:17,650
琳赛，我很确定
Lindsay, I was so sure.

859
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,860
就像第一次一样
Just like the first time.

860
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,660
嗨,罗杰
Hey, Roger.

861
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,910
我想让你见个人
There's someone I want you to meet.

862
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,620
我一直喜欢科里
I always liked Corey.

863
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,290
你知道，有些孩子，你能看出来他们很讨厌，
You know, some kids, you can tell they're a pain in the ass,

864
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,000
但科里是个好孩子
but Corey was a good kid.

865
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,090
我只是无法想象他会有这种能力
And I just couldn't imagine he'd be capable

866
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:38,340
故意伤害别人
of hurting anyone on purpose.

867
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,840
但这次审判，我…
But with the trial, I...

868
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,430
我刚开始琢磨各种理论，然后…
just started spinning with theories, and...

869
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,850
最后我想，
and eventually I thought,

870
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,310
“放弃它你永远都不会结束的
"Give it up. You're never gonna get closure.

871
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,890
根本就没有这回事”
There's no such thing."

872
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,980
几年过去了，我偶尔会看到他，
A couple of years go by, and I'd see him every now and then,

873
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,900
看看人们是怎么躲着他的
see the way people avoided him

874
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,270
或者他们在他背后做鬼脸，
or how they made faces behind his back,

875
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,480
说实话，这让我很生气
which, if I'm honest, pissed me off.

876
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,740
因为我觉得他们带走了我的痛苦…
Because I felt like they took my pain...

877
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,950
...我的绝望,
...my despair,

878
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,990
他们把它变成了关于他们的
and they made it about them.

879
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,710
然后，昨天，我在上班的路上
And then, yesterday, I'm on my way to work.

880
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,210
他就在这里
There he is.

881
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,670
我想"我要说点什么，
And I think, "I'm gonna say something,

882
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,090
“证明我妻子是错的
"prove my wife wrong.

883
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,470
让我们想办法原谅这个孩子吧”
Let's find a way to forgive this kid."

884
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:25,600
我把车停在他旁边，他看着我，
And I pull up next to him, and he looks at me,

885
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,060
那不是他
and it's not him.

886
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,190
至少不是在眼睛里
At least not in the eyes.

887
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,900
我不知道，伙计
And I don't know, man.

888
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,030
我脖子后面的汗毛都竖起来了
The hairs on the back of my neck stood up.

889
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,530
就在那时，我觉得我得到了答案
Right then, I felt like I got my answer.

890
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,740
以前给我们修剪草坪的那个孩子没有杀我儿子
The kid who used to mow our lawn didn't kill my son.

891
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:49,410
我知道
I know that.

892
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,750
但我在路边看到的那个人
But the guy I saw on the side of the road

893
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:55,460
走上了一条黑暗的道路
was down a dark path.

894
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,920
是镇上的人在事故后这么对他的吗?
Did the town do this to him after the accident?

895
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,260
还是一直都在?
Or was it always there?

896
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,060
我讲的笑话你都在笑，
You're just laughing at all my jokes,

897
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,640
-不你?-(Deb笑)
-aren't you? -(Deb laughs)

898
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,730
哦,我的老天
Oh, my God.

899
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,060
好吧,Alexa
All right, Alexa.

900
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,230
播放Rob Galbraith的《用你的眼睛告诉我》
Play "Tell Me With Your Eyes" by Rob Galbraith.

901
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,690
ALEXA:这是“用你的眼睛告诉我……”
ALEXA: Here's "Tell Me With Your Eyes..."

902
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:22,570
这房子太…
This house is so...

903
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:23,860
富有
rich.

904
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,580
宝贝，我等这一刻等了一整天了
Baby, I have been waiting all day for this.

905
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:35,330
我一直保存着这瓶法式香槟
I've been saving this bottle of Au Bon Climat.

906
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:37,960
你今天在办公室的样子真他妈性感
You looked so fucking hot at the office today.

907
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,630
介意我……
Mind if I...

908
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,470
卧室在走廊尽头
Bedroom's down the hall.

909
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,050
清理洗澡
Clean up. Take a shower.

910
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,510
事实上，我们在那里见
In fact, I'll meet you in there.

911
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,560
是的,是的
Yes, yes.

912
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,310
是的
Yes.

913
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,050
天呐(点击的舌头)
Holy shit. (clicks tongue)

914
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,180
家里有医生吗?
Is there a doctor in the house?

915
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,190
是的,宝贝好吧
Yeah, baby. All right.

916
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,850
得到了奶酪我们有饼干
Got the cheese. We got the crackers.

917
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,060
我们已经做好了准备
We're ready.

918
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,030
马修斯博士吗?
Dr. Mathis?

919
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,910
马修斯博士吗?
Dr. Mathis?

920
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,250
马修斯博士吗?
Dr. Mathis?

921
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,310
马修斯博士吗?
Dr. Mathis?

922
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,060
求你了，求你了，求你了求你了，求你了，求你了
Please, please, please, please. Please, please, please, please.

923
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,860
911年……
911...

924
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,460
事故发生后,
After the accident,

925
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,590
我会骑着自行车过来，坐在屋顶上
I'd ride my bike over here and I'd sit up on this roof.

926
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,180
我抬头看着那座塔
And I'd look up at that tower.

927
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,220
不知道我能不能爬到山顶
Wonder if I could climb to the top.

928
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,520
它在召唤我
It was summoning me.

929
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:06,770
就像瞭望塔或灯塔在召唤我回到过去的生活
Like a watchtower or beacon calling me to live my old life.

930
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:08,060
重新快乐起来
To be happy again.

931
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,740
我也有类似的东西
I have something like that, too.

932
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,570
它总是给我希望，你知道，事情会
It always gave me hope, you know, things would--

933
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,490
也许一切都能回到过去
well, maybe somehow things would go back

934
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:22,660
回到他们过去的样子
to the way they used to be.

935
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,750
之前一切都改变了
Before everything changed.

936
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,090
感染
Infected.

937
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,180
我得远离所有认识我的人
I got to get away from everybody who knows me.

938
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,720
但我不，我…
But I don't, I...

939
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,810
我不想一个人去
I don't want to go alone.

940
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,150
科里,来吧
Corey, come on.

941
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,860
停止
-Stop.

942
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,150
我觉得你是害怕没有足够的绷带
I think you're scared that you don't have enough bandages

943
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,990
让我振作起来
to keep me together.

944
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,110
科里，你在…?
Corey, what are you...?

945
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:05,200
你都好吗?
-Are you okay?

946
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,540
怎么，你疯了吗?
What, are you insane?

947
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:08,370
怎么，你想自杀吗?
What, are you trying to kill yourself?

948
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,460
我对永生不感兴趣
I'm not interested in immortality.

949
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,430
这到底是怎么回事?
The hell is going on out here?

950
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:22,390
这是私人领地
Yo, this is private property.

951
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,890
不管你做什么都不安全…
Not safe to be doing whatever the hell you do...

952
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:28,230
科里坎宁安
Corey Cunningham.

953
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,770
你在外面干什么，你个丑八怪?
What you doing out here, you ugly motherfucker?

954
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:32,060
-科里，别说了-你会吓到所有的孩子
- Corey, stop it. -You gonna scare all the kids.

955
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:33,440
你停止
You stop.

956
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,320
我不知道你在跟谁说话，
I don't know who the fuck you talking to,

957
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,820
但我知道你是谁
but, uh, I know who you are.

958
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,780
我知道劳里·斯特罗德的事
Yeah, I know the Laurie Strode story.

959
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:48,160
她取笑一个脑损伤的男人，然后他就崩溃了
She teased a man with brain damage, and then he snapped.

960
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,710
看看你
Look at you.

961
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,790
你现在想出名了吗?
You gonna make a little name for yourself now, huh?

962
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:54,090
和这个蠢婊子在一起
Walking around with this dumb bitch right here.

963
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,300
你从来不闭嘴
You never shut up.

964
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,420
到处都能听到他的声音
Hear his voice everywhere.

965
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,420
你他妈说对了
Oh, you're goddamn right you do.

966
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,970
一旦威利进入你的耳朵，
And once Willie get in your ear,

967
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:03,640
就像你最喜欢的歌在你脑海里挥之不去
it's like your favorite song stuck in your head.

968
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:09,230
你们都给我滚出去
Y'all get the hell up off my property

969
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,690
在我把你们都搞死之前
before I fuck y'all up.

970
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,150
-好的
-All right.

971
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,650
你是对的
You're right.

972
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:20,280
让我们做它
Let's do it.

973
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,990
我不想再待在哈顿菲尔德了
I don't want to be in Haddonfield anymore.

974
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,990
我想和你在一起
I want to be with you.

975
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,600
我能在你身上闻到她的味道
I can smell her on you.

976
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,310
她想把你从我身边夺走，是吗?
She's trying to take you away from me, isn't she?

977
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,020
你每天晚上都去那里
That's where you go every night.

978
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,770
好吧，我说去吧
Well, I say go.

979
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,900
你现在就去
You go right now

980
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,980
滚出我的房子
Get out of my house

981
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,780
哦,不不
Oh, no. No.

982
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,420
我希望你找到真爱
I hope you find love.

983
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:37,360
埃里森?
Allyson?

984
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:46,950
很高兴见到你
It's nice to see you.

985
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,750
你知道，有两种邪恶
You know, there are two kinds of evil.

986
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:03,590
一种是作为外部力量存在的邪恶
There's the evil that exists as an external force

987
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,470
这威胁到部落的福祉
that threatens the well-being of the tribe.

988
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:11,970
生存取决于理解和意识
Survival depends on understanding and awareness

989
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:16,560
以及对日常生活的身体威胁的恐惧
and fear of physical threat to our daily lives.

990
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,650
另一种邪恶存在于我们体内
The other kind of evil lives inside us.

991
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:24,490
比如疾病或感染
Like a sickness or an infection.

992
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:30,530
更危险的是我们可能不知道自己被感染了
It's more dangerous because we may not know we're infected.

993
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,920
我是个坏人吗?
Am I a bad person?

994
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,920
是吗?
Are you?

995
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,510
嗯…
Well...

996
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,470
...我们都是满不在乎的
...we're both fucked-up.

997
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:52,850
我想帮你，科里-
-I want to help you, Corey. -

998
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:54,140
让我来帮你
Let me help you.

999
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,310
或者让我帮你找帮手
Or let me find help for you.

1000
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:57,850
你不能拥有她
You can't have her.

1001
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,810
艾莉森不适合这段感情，
Allyson is not equipped for this relationship,

1002
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:03,110
我不会让她受到伤害的
and I will not let her get hurt.

1003
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,070
所以离我远点…
So stay the fuck away...

1004
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:06,950
你开始这个
You started this

1005
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,870
是你带我来的 你邀请我
You brought me in  You invited me

1006
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,370
但你才是罪魁祸首
But you're the one to blame.

1007
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,870
“你想做，还是你想让我做?”
"You want to do it, or you want me to?"

1008
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,380
如果我不能拥有她…
If I can't have her...

1009
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,890
...没有人会
...no one will.

1010
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:36,480
你想帮艾莉森吗?让她过她自己的生活
You want to help Allyson? Let her live her life.

1011
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,560
她现在有我了
She has me now.

1012
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:50,490
你应该让步
You should give in.

1013
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,540
你应该向你的那种感觉屈服
You should surrender to that feeling you had

1014
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,080
你第一次看着他的眼睛
the first time you ever looked into his eyes.

1015
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:04,630
你暗地里希望迈克尔回来找你
You secretly hope Michael comes back for you.

1016
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,090
我是神经病
I'm the psycho.

1017
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,430
你才是怪胎
You're the freak show.

1018
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:53,640
怎么了?
What's wrong?

1019
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:54,760
我们得走了
We need to leave.

1020
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,600
现在不行我的工作
I can't right now. I'm working.

1021
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,770
那么,今晚
Tonight, then.

1022
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:03,600
9点见好吗?
Will you meet me at 9:00?

1023
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:05,900
在74街的餐厅
At the diner off 74.

1024
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,150
我们得谈谈你祖母的事
We need to talk about your grandmother.

1025
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:12,110
她想杀了我
She wants to kill me.

1026
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:14,070
-什么?-是的
-What? -Yeah.

1027
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,120
我再也受不了了
I can't take it anymore.

1028
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,910
是时候和哈顿菲尔德说再见了
It's time to say goodbye to Haddonfield.

1029
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,800
你有我需要的东西
You got something I need.

1030
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,670
(的)
(both grunting)

1031
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,490
(科里大叫呻吟)
(Corey shouts, groans)

1032
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,860
你只是个戴着万圣节面具的人
You're just a man in a Halloween mask.

1033
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,660
你现在打算怎么办?
What are you gonna do now?

1034
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,330
(喘着粗气)
(both breathing heavily)

1035
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:21,600
上他后
-Call him after.

1036
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,890
我不想去你家，伙计
I don't want to go to your house, man.

1037
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,270
你爸总是对我们大吼大叫
Your dad always fucking yells at us.

1038
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,730
太坏你应该有你自己的
Too fucking bad. You should've got your own.

1039
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:27,350
反正也不应该有这些东西
Shouldn't have any of these anyway.

1040
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,020
为什么我们不能去她家?她才是那个有钱的人
Why can't we go to her house? She's the one that's rich.

1041
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,190
-哦,什么?是的开枪什么?
-Oh, what? Yeah. Shoot. What the fuck?

1042
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:32,030
什么?
What?

1043
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,110
他死了 进入
He's dead  Get in

1044
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,570
哦,妈蛋妈蛋
Oh, shit. Shit.

1045
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,260
你找到要找的东西了吗?
Did you find what you're looking for?

1046
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,590
我想你的旅行一定很愉快
I imagine you're going on a wonderful trip.

1047
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,470
-你打算告诉我吗?有什么区别吗?
-Were you gonna tell me? -What difference does it make?

1048
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:02,890
这很重要，艾莉森
It makes a big difference, Allyson.

1049
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,730
我觉得他有能力造成真正的伤害
I feel he is capable of real harm.

1050
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,980
这是困扰你的吗?
Is that what bothers you?

1051
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:11,900
是怀疑还是妄想?
Is it suspicion or paranoia?

1052
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,900
直觉吗?一个暗示吗?
Intuition? An inkling?

1053
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,150
你知道吗?
You got an inkling?

1054
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:17,610
我去了他家我见到了他的母亲
I went to his home. I met his mother.

1055
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,910
我知道他告诉我
I know. He told me.

1056
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,580
所以,你是什么?你现在跟踪他了?
So, you're what? You're stalking him now?

1057
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,160
-不-你在威胁他
-No. -And you're threatening him.

1058
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,620
-你对他说了什么?-我在他身上看到了同样的东西
-What did you say to him? -I-I see the same thing in him

1059
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,920
-我在迈克尔身上看到的迈克尔
-that I saw in Michael. -Michael.

1060
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,670
迈克尔·迈尔斯就是你
Michael Myers is who you are.

1061
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,540
你没听我说，艾莉森
You're not listening to me, Allyson.

1062
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,920
我是在保护你
I am trying to protect you.

1063
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,420
我不需要你的保护
I don't want your protection

1064
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,550
但你可以过上好日子，艾莉森
But you-you can have a good life, Allyson.

1065
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:40,890
一个好的生活
A good life.

1066
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,680
只是不是和他
Just not with him.

1067
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:45,770
你假装你已经向前看了，但这都是扯淡
You pretend like you moved on, but it's bullshit.

1068
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,480
你只是对死亡着迷
You're actually just obsessed with death,

1069
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,890
就像一场游戏
like it's some sort of game.

1070
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,600
不完成任务你是不会休息的
And you're not gonna rest until you've finished it

1071
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:53,230
或者直到所有人都像你一样痛苦
or until everybody else is as fucking miserable as you are

1072
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:55,940
我得在这镇子杀人之前离开这里
I need to get out of here before this town kills

1073
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:58,820
唯一一个让我有感觉的人
the one person that actually makes me feel something.

1074
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,950
-他走在一条黑暗的道路上
-He is on a dark path

1075
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,620
我不会让这种事发生在你身上
I'm not gonna let this happen to you

1076
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,160
你一定要相信我
You have to believe me

1077
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,910
相信你?
Believe you?

1078
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,960
你想让我相信你?
You want me to believe you?

1079
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,090
因为你引起的歇斯底里
Because of the hysteria that you caused

1080
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:17,760
当我信任你的时候，我的朋友们都死了
when I trusted you, my friends are dead.

1081
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,300
我的父母都死了
My parents are dead.

1082
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:23,260
你才是那个会伤害别人的人
You're the one that's capable of fucking harm

1083
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,720
(耳机里传来的枪声和刺耳的轮胎声)
(gunfire and tires screeching over headphones)

1084
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:37,400
你确定他在这里翻的吗，伙计?
You sure he turned in here, dude?

1085
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,030
是啊，好像是他的藏身处
Yeah, it's like his hideout or something.

1086
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:40,490
那是他工作的地方
It's where he works.

1087
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,120
-他的作品很烂-实际上是垃圾场
-His work is a dump. -It actually is a dump.

1088
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,950
好吧，但说真的，他在哪?
Okay, no, but seriously, where is he?

1089
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,290
有自行车-该死，哥们，靠边停车
There's the bike. -Shit, dude, pull over.

1090
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,910
这太疯狂了
This is gonna be so crazy.

1091
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,830
小的走了比利，你能快点吗?
-Let's go.  Billy, can you hurry up?

1092
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:53,460
科里 你是压扁我
-Corey  -You're squishing me.

1093
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,170
-老天-他去了?
-God. -Where'd he go?

1094
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:56,380
出来,科里
Come out, Corey

1095
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,260
科里，我只想吻你和好，伙计
Corey, I just want to kiss and make up, my man

1096
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,930
-来吧 -别当废物了
-Come on  -Stop being a punk

1097
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,840
科里 -你在哪儿，伙计?
Corey  -Where you at, man?

1098
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:06,100
我让你看看你弄坏我爸爸的车会有什么后果
I'll show you what happens when you mess with my dad's car

1099
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,970
-我们能快点吗?
- -Can we hurry this up, man?

1100
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,520
哦，我有个主意
Oh, I got an idea.

1101
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,150
比利，倒车
Billy, back the car up.

1102
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,110
的赌注
Bet.

1103
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,520
抓住链我们走吧

等一切都准备好了，

1163
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:56,740
我们去把奶油冻起来，然后打发……

...把这个容器放在冰箱里

1170
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,640
大概，半小时到一小时吧
for about, oh, half an hour to an hour

1171
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,970
所以它会变硬
so it'll firm up.

1172
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,470
现在我们要吃了它

1178

给我们点可以尖叫的东西?

1179
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,450
来电者，你正在广播中

威利，你应该这样

“你自己不会变成一个怪物，
"you yourself do not become a monster,

1185
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:48,800
"因为当你凝视深渊时，
"for when you gaze long into the abyss,

1186
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,260
深渊也向你凝视”
the abyss gazes also into you."

1187
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:55,260
尼采也说过:“没有音乐……”
Nietzsche also said, "Without music..."

1188
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,390
＂...生活将是一个错误”

我能为您效劳吗?

1190

伙计，你到底是谁?

你真以为我会自杀吗?

1200
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:45,490
-我已经很努力了…(呻吟)

1201
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:49,620
...要有怜悯之心，寻求怜悯
...to have compassion and find mercy.

1202
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:55,540
但这有什么意义呢?
But what's the point?

1203
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:07,130
你是来杀我的，动手吧
You came here to kill me, so do it.

1204

你真的以为
Did you really think

1207
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:45,750
艾莉森会和你在一起吗

1208
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,090
如果我不能拥有她…
If I can't have her...

1209
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:53,760
你个混蛋

1210
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,740
你做了什么?
What did you do?

阿廖沙,劳里在哪儿?

别挡道待在这里

01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:14,260
事情不是这样的
This is not how it works.

1246
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,840
这是今晚
It is tonight.

1247
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:18,850
无线电静默更强
Uh, stronger on radio silence.

1248
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:20,140
这一定是个命令
That's got to be a command.

1249
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,850
收到-副本
Copy that. - Copy.

1250
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:24,850
小的走了

1252
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:56,000
在午夜游行中被处理掉了

1253
01:42:56,050 --> 01:42:59,260
没有墓碑，没有纪念碑
There would be no tombstone, no memorial.

1254
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:01,760
谜团被解开了，
The mysteries were put to bed,

1255
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:05,470
我们所说的故事会随着时间的流逝而消失
and the story as we told it was to fade with time.

1256
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:12,640
科里的事你说得对
You were right about Corey.

1257
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,770
我知道他杀了那些人
I know he killed those people.

1258
01:43:21,450 --> 01:43:23,700
他被邪恶吞噬了
He was consumed by evil.

1259
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:30,700
哈顿菲尔德的事件
The events of Haddonfield

1260
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:33,540
造成了如此多的暴力和流血事件
that created so much violence and bloodshed

1261
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,960
终于解决
finally had resolve.

1262
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,550
有报道证实迈克尔·迈尔斯
Reports now confirm that Michael Myers

1263
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:48,260
在袭击未遂后被杀

1264
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:50,890
哈顿菲尔德居民劳里·斯特罗德的尸体
of Haddonfield resident Laurie Strode.

1265
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:53,890
多么难以置信的生存故事啊
What an incredible story of survival

1266
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:56,190
经过我们当地社区几十年的动乱
through decades of disturbances in our local community.

1267
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,610
最后……
Finally...

1268
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:06,780
新的开始在前面
New beginnings lay ahead.

1269
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:09,740
我们所有人都会感到恐惧，
Fear moves through all of us,

1270
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:12,450
我们决定何时投降
and we decide when to surrender.

1271
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,920
我已经和我的恶魔说了再见，
I've said goodbye to my boogeyman,

1272
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,750
但事实是邪恶不会消失
but the truth is evil doesn't die.

1273
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:22,720
它改变了形状
It changes shape.

1274
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:44,490
我想让你知道我在想你
I wanted you to know I was thinking about you.

1275
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:46,700
我想感谢你所做的一切
I want to thank you for what you did.

1276
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:51,370
享受
Enjoy.

1277
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,510
你说那些樱花是什么意思?
What was it you were saying about those cherry blossoms?
