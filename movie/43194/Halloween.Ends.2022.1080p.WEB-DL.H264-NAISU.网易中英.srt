但我们还是来谈谈迈克尔·迈尔斯吧。
But let's talk about that Michael Myers for a minute.

274
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,424
一个人怎么会被枪击，被捅死
How does one man get shot at, stabbed up

275
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,260
然后他从街上摔下来又爬起来
and then he fall down the street and get back up

276
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,180
把哈顿菲尔德的人都吓尿了
to scare the piss out of everybody in Haddonfield?

277
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,808
我来告诉你怎么做，因为这不是男人。
Let me tell you how-- 'cause this isn't a man.

278
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,687
这不仅仅是一个人。这是一头野兽。(咆哮)
This is more than a man. This is a beast. (growls)

279
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,522

我很确定这是在更改顺序里的。
I'm pretty sure that was in the change order.

嘿，科里，你迟到了!
Hey, Corey, you're late!

283

也许是在为这个大日子训练?
Training for the big day, perhaps?

287
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,579
进入精神状态了吗?
Getting yourself in the spirit?

288
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,623
这个恶魔一直在冬眠，
This Boogeyman been sitting in hibernation,

289
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,126
但相信我，他会回来的。
but trust me, y'all, he'll be back.

290
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,046
我是威利小子，我要来真的
I'm Willie the Kid, and I'll be creeping it real

291
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,381

科里，你有空吗?
Corey, you got a second?

293
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,099
你怎么看?
What do you think?

294
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,768
是的。

买些新盘子。

297
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,358
-我再也用不上了。你是认真的吗?
-I got no use for it no more. -Are you serious?

298
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,527
在一个好的引擎的推动下，你终于成功了
With a good engine pushing you, finally make it

299
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,696
准时上班，你明白我的意思吗?

300
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,197
它工作吗?
Does it work?

301
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,325
还行，就是有点烂。
Yeah, it works, just kind of shitty.

302
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,957
嘿,嗯,罗纳德?

你被捕了。

你是我认识的最漂亮的女孩。
For being the prettiest girl I know.

00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,194
这很好,道格。
That's nice, Doug.

311
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,571
所以你才让我靠边停车吗?
Is that why you pulled me over?

312
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,074
不。我让你靠边停车是因为我想你。
No. I pulled you over 'cause I miss you.

313
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,533
你想念我吗?
You miss me?

314
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,077
(呵呵):开玩笑的。
(chuckling): Just kidding.

315
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,328
让你靠边停车，因为看起来
Pulled you over 'cause it looks like

316
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,746
你的消音器快掉了。
your muffler's about to fall off.

317
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,247
最好在你有更大的之前把它修好

史黛西:寒冷。我是指定司机。

-我知道怎么开车。-请不要弄坏我的车。
-I know how to drive. -Don't mess up my car, please.

-I'm not gonna mess up your car. -All right?

335

这不是仇恨。来吧。
It's no hating on. Come on.

338
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,648
特里:比利。身份证吗?计划是什么?
-TERRY: Billy. I.D.? -STACY: So what's the plan?

-Give me the I.D. -I.D.? -(entry bell chimes)

340
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,235
-是的。-上周被没收了。
-Yeah. -It got confiscated last week.

341

我告诉过你。-她有钱。

-你没带身份证?等。你什么?
-You don't have your I.D.? -Wait. You what?

-Look, here's the deal, man. -(Billy wolf whistles)

348
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,041
我们老年人,好吗?
We're seniors, okay?

349
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,335
我们一整年都在为我们的演出练习。
We've been practicing for our show the whole year, you know.

350
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,337
准备今晚的比赛，还有

我们是行军乐队的一员。

我们只是希望你能成为一个很酷的新朋友。

(笑,普通员工)
(chuckles, grunts)

355
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,184
只给我和我的团队。来吧,男人。(笑)
Just-just for me and my crew. Come on, man. (chuckles)

356
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,977
哦,不。
Uh, no.

357
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,563
没有?
No?

358
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,106
禁忌,谢谢?什么?
No-no, thank you? What?

359
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,566
-不,我不能。史黛西:哦,等等。
-No, I can't. -STACY: Oh, wait.

360
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,735
-我知道你是谁。-你做了些乱七八糟的事。
-I know who you are. -You did something messy.

361
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,945
我不敢相信他们居然放了你。-他是谁?
-STACY: I can't believe they let you off. -Well, who is he?

362
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,489
-哦,是的。-是的。
-Oh, yeah. -Yeah.

363
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,033
你就是那个变态保姆。
You're that psycho babysitter.

364
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,326
他杀了那个孩子，是吗?
He killed that kid, didn't he?

365
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,994
是的。-杀了个孩子，太娘了
-Yep. -Killed a kid and too pussy

366
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,371
-给我们买点啤酒?伙计们，你们知道吗?
-to buy us some fucking beer? -MARGO: Guys, you know what?

367
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,622
让我们他妈的忘了这事吧。
Let's just fucking forget about it.

368
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,040
我们去看比赛吧，好吗?
Let's just go to the game, okay?

369
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,625
-你只是个小顽童。对他的文采。
-You're just a little pedo. -Look at him.

370
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,668
-告诉他，特里。-你是什么?
-Let him know, Terry. -That what you are?

371
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,919
一个变态的变态?
A little fucking pedo creep?

372
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,379
——是对的。-到他面前去，特里。
-That's right. -Get in his face, Terry.

373
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,963
你他妈算哪门子孩子?
What kind of fucked-up kid are you?

374
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:14,756
——是对的。-对。-下一个受害者是谁?
-That's right. -Right. -So where's your next victim?

375
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,841
-啊!什么他妈的? !
-Whoa! -What the fuck?!

376
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,842
你在开玩笑吗，伙计?
Are you kidding me, man?

377
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,219
-哦，该死。
-(pained shout) -STACY: Oh, shit.

378
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,595
——(笑声)——(科里呻吟)
-(laughter) -(Corey groans)

379
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,971
(喘气)
(panting)

380
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,473
看看你。-搞什么，Terry?
-BILLY: Look at you. -MARGO: What the fuck, Terry?

381
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,891
比利:到处都是该死的牛奶。
BILLY: Got fucking milk everywhere.

382
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,601
margo:天啊。看看你做了什么。
-MARGO: Holy shit. -BILLY: Look what you did.

383
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,145
劳丽:嘿!混蛋!
LAURIE: Hey! Assholes!

384
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,730
住嘴!
Knock it off!

385
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,898
-我们什么都没做。-我们只是谈谈，小姐。
-We're not doing anything. -We're just talking, miss.

386
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,733
我们是在捣乱。马女士。
-We're messing around. -Ma'am.

387
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,485
-(笑声)-特瑞:嘿，伙计们。
-(laughter) -TERRY: Hey, guys.

388
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,736
你能看看这个吗?
Would you look at this?

389
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,446
我是说，一个疯子遇上了畸形人。
I mean, a psycho meets a freak show.

390
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,781
-哇。真不敢相信。
-Wow. -BILLY: Can't believe it.

391
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,408
特瑞:这真是天作之合。
TERRY: This is a match made in heaven.

392
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,159
-嘿,来吧。看着我。现在大大泡泡糖。
-Hey, come on. Look at me. -Ta-ta for now.

393
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,619
我们走吧,你们。
Let's go, y'all.

394
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,413
(低声说):迈克尔·迈尔斯。
(whispers): Michael Myers.

395
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,914
(科里呼吸严重)
(Corey breathes heavily)

396
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,582
(Stacy笑)
(Stacy laughing)

397
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,001
(玻璃在地上叮当作响)
(glass clinks on ground)

398
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,086
罗芮:你是神经病还是怪胎?
LAURIE: Are you the psycho or the freak show?

399
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,922
嘿，玛戈，你想去看周六的学校演出吗?
Hey, Margo, do you want to go to the school play on Saturday?

400
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,757
是的，当然，Terry。——有趣。
-MARGO: Yeah, sure, Terry. -Have fun.

401
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,010
模糊喋喋不休(笑声)
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

402
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,931
所以，是你自己来，还是我来?
So, do you want to do it, or you want me to?

403
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,478
(空气发出嘶嘶声)(普通员工)
-(air hissing) -(grunts)

404
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,110
阿莉森:看它。
ALLYSON: Look at it.

405
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,111
黛布:你在开玩笑吗?
DEB: Are you kidding?

406
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,320
你穿起来很好看。
It looks great on you.

407
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,031
我知道，但我不会去的。
I'm sure it does, but I'm not going.

408
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,950
一旦你穿上整件衣服，你会喜欢的。
Once you put the whole outfit on, you'll love it.

409
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,245
我觉得不性感就不是万圣节。
I say if it's not sexy, it's not Halloween.

410
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,915
看来有人已经进入了这种精神状态。
Well, someone's getting into the spirit of things.

411
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,796
这位先生出了意外，需要修理一下。
This gentleman had an accident and needs a little fix-up.

412
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,923
马西斯医生:你有严重的炎症。
DR. MATHIS: You have significant inflammation.

413
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,135
我要好好麻醉一下这里
Um, I'm gonna be nice and numb it here

414
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,304
所以我的助手可以把它清理得很好，
so my assistant can clean it up really well,

415
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,682
然后我会回来用缝线缝合伤口。
and then I will get back and close it with a suture.

416
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,521
你会觉得这里有点刺痛。
You're gonna feel a little bit of a pinch here.

417
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,150
可爱,不是吗?
Cute, isn't she?

418
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,485
我不,噢!
I don't-- Ow!

419
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,320
耶稣基督!阿廖沙:对不起。对不起。
-Jesus Christ! -ALLYSON: Sorry. Sorry.

420
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,905
我很抱歉。我很抱歉。-艾莉森，你在干什么?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Allyson, what are you doing?

421
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,281
-是我的错。对不起。阿廖沙!
-COREY: It's my fault. Sorry. -Allyson!

422
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,407
-不。阿廖沙:对不起,对不起。
-No. -ALLYSON: Sorry, sorry.

423
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,159
不。不,我的错。这是我的错。
No. No, my fault. It was my fault.

424
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,994
我很抱歉。哦,天啊。是。马西斯:真是一团糟。
-I-I'm so sorry. Oh, geez. -DR. MATHIS: What a mess.

425
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,455
把它清理干净，拿个该死的消毒包。
Just clean it up and get a goddamn sterile kit.

426
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,040
给他打一针破伤风针。
And give him a tetanus shot.

427
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,042
我马上就回来。
I'll be back.

428
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,511
你不该让那家伙那样跟你说话。
You shouldn't let that guy talk to you like that.

429
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,766
会让你难过的，即使你不这么认为。
It's gonna make you sad, even if you don't think it does.

430
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,644
我处理过更糟糕的。
I've dealt with much worse.

431
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,022
但是谢谢你。
But thank you.

432
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,526
总之，我一直在处理这件事。
Anyway, I've just been dealing with it.

433
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,779
我本该得到这次晋升的。
Well, I'm supposed to get this promotion.

434
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,573
-但不管怎样，这只是…-值得吗?
-But either way, it's just... -Is it worth it?

435
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,536
你会做什么呢?
What'd you do?

436
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,246
-嗯……——你的手吗?
-Uh... -To your hand?

437
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,748
我在工作，然后出了点小意外。
Uh, I was at work, and then I had a little accident.

438
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,709
-所以你的工作也很糟糕。嗯?
-So your job sucks, too. -Hmm?

439
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,460
你在哪里工作?你会做什么?
Where do you work? What do you do?

440
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,879
-科里:哦，修理店。不要移动。
-COREY: Oh, a mechanic shop. -Don't move.

441
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,549
-不想被感染-(杯子在托盘中叮当作响)
-Don't want to get infected. -(glass clinks in tray)

442
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,217
我的车一直响个不停。
So my car's been rattling.

443
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,927
活泼的吗?-是的。
-Rattling? -Yeah.

444
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,179
只是你的排气系统夹松了。
Uh, it's just your exhaust system clamp's come loose.

445
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,973
这很容易解决。大概需要五分钟。
It's an easy fix. It takes like five minutes.

446
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,017
超级cinchy。
Super cinchy.

447
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,770
你只需要一个升降机和两个螺丝。
You just need a lift and two screws.

448
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:16,938
“Cinchy”?
"Cinchy"?

449
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,399
你不用现在就去修。
You don't have to fix it right now.

450
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,777
是的，我没带我的东西，但是…
Yeah, I don't have my stuff, but...

451
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,988
我明天在商店。
I am at the shop tomorrow.

452
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,197
那时我可以修好它。
I can fix it then.

453
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,575
为什么自行车不能自己站起来?
Why can't the bicycle stand on its own?

454
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,076
不,不。它可以。
No, no. It can.

455
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,619
它有一个支架。
It's got a kickstand.

456
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,414
因为它太累了。
'Cause it was too tired.

457
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,875
(笑着说)
(laughing)

458
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,043
是的。
Yeah.

459
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,046
其实我要把自行车扔了，
Oh, I'm actually getting rid of the bike,

460
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,089
所以如果你想要，就给你。
so if you want it, you can have it.

461
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,591
我有一辆摩托车。
I got a motorcycle.

462
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,384
-哦,一辆摩托车吗?-是的。
-Oh, a motorcycle? -Yeah.

463
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,636
教我骑?
Teach me to ride it?

464
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,306
是的。
Yeah.

465
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,600
你背上有屎。
You have shit on your back.

466
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,478
我将得到它。
I'll get it.

467
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,275
我们应该找个时间出去做点什么。
We should go out sometime and do something.

468
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,527
——我吗?-和我们两个一起。
-With me? -With both of us.

469
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,945
我是说，我们两个都得去。
I mean, we'd both have to be there.

470
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,448
否则，这不是一个很好的时间。
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a very good time.

471
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,700
(科里笑)
(Corey chuckles)

472
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,869
是啊，你不会想这么做的。
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

473
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,081
我晚饭要迟到了。
Uh, I'm gonna be late for dinner.

474
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,336
但是，我很感谢你的帮助。
But, uh, I appreciate the hand.

475
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,588
感觉已经好多了。
It feels better already.

476
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,465
阿廖森:所以你是故意的。
ALLYSON: So you did that on purpose.

477
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,466
劳丽:什么?
LAURIE: What?

478
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,842
他受伤了,
He was injured,

479
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,636
他需要治疗，而马西斯医生
he needed medical attention, and Dr. Mathis

480
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,054
是城里最好的。-你相信她吗?
-is the best in town. -Do you believe her?

481
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,764
-她说的话一个字也不要信。(笑)
-Do not believe a word she says. -(chuckles)

482
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,391
-你知道，她是个战略家。——在,好,好。
-You know, she's a strategist. -Fine, fine, fine.

483
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,642
她只是想扮演丘比特。
She's just trying to play Cupid.

484
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:36,559
我觉得他很可爱。似乎不错。
Thought he was cute. Seemed nice.

485
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,602
你会给他打电话吗
Are you gonna call him

486
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,645
邀请他参加她的派对
and invite him to her party,

487
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,063
还是你要一个人去?
or you gonna just go alone?

488
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,731
琳赛:现在选一张牌。嗯哼。
LINDSAY: Now pick a card. Mm-hmm.

489
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,191
哦,不。我拿到死亡牌了
Oh, no. I got the death card.

490
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,984
-不，塔罗牌还不错。劳丽:毫米毫米。
-No, that's not bad in tarot. -LAURIE: Mm-mm.

491
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,862
琳赛:不，那只是意味着一个主要阶段结束了
LINDSAY: No, that just means a major phase is ending

492
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,280
新的一段就要开始了。
and a new one is about to begin.

493
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,825
所以，这几乎是在棺材上钉了一颗钉子
So, that pretty much puts a nail in the coffin

494
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,993
和你约会的那个警官。
with that police officer you were dating.

495
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,788
啊,道格。——(Lindsay笑)
-Ugh, Doug. -(Lindsay chuckles)

496
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,290
你得找个能放手的人。
You know, you need to find someone that can let go.

497
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,292
这让你想扯掉你的衬衫
That makes you want to rip off your shirt

498
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,753
露出你那该死的奶子，说，
and show grief your fucking tits and say,

499
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,755
“你知道吗?我们走吧。”
"You know what? Let's go."

500
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,717
真好吃。(电视静静地玩)
-JOAN: This is delicious. -(TV playing quietly)

501
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,177
科里。它感染了吗?
Corey. Is it infected?

502
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,054
你的手感染了吗?医生怎么说?
Is your hand infected? What did the doctor say?

503
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,514
他说会没事的，妈妈。
He said it's gonna be fine, Mama.

504
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,974
他说你不用担心，
He said that you don't need to worry,

505
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,684
他说会很棒的，这是他说的。
and he said it would be terrific is what he said.

506
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,519
我可能得把他送回呼叫中心了
Well, I just might have to send him back to the call center

507
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,188
为戴文工作，如果你不能给他适当的监督
to work for DeVon if you can't give him proper supervision.

508
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,482
我无法专注于每一秒。
I can't keep my eyes on every second.

509
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,735
(电话嗡嗡声)
(phone buzzing)

510
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,030
琼:你到底在干什么?
JOAN: What the hell are you doing?

511
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,115
谁在餐桌底下叫你?
Who's that calling you under the dinner table?

512
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,409
科里:哦，没人，妈妈。
COREY: Uh, it's no one, Mama.

513
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,454
琼:你在给谁发短信?
JOAN: Who's that person you're texting?

514
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:38,663
(嗡嗡声)
(buzzing)

515
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,707
这是没有人。
It's no one.

516
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,293
(叹息)
(sighs)

517
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,796
保守秘密的男孩不会得到奶油蛋羹当甜点。
Boys who keep secrets don't get custard for dessert.

518
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,720
那就别告诉她摩托车的事。
Don't tell her about the motorcycle, then.

519
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,639
(引擎的转速)
(engine revving)

520
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,241
福特旅行车。
Ford station wagon.

521
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,536
-(发动机叮当声)-等一下。
-(engine rattling and clanking) -Hold on one second.

522
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,997
有什么我能帮忙的吗?
Something I can help you with?

523
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,125
科里说我应该把它带来。
Corey said I should bring it in.

524
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,091
(引擎关闭了)
(engine shuts off)

525
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,884
得到。
Get on.

526
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,305
好吧,所以…
Okay, so...

527
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,349
(科里咕哝声,嗅探)
(Corey grunts, sniffs)

528
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,767
好的。
Okay.

529
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,103
右手，煤气。左手是你的前——
Uh, right hand, gas. Left hand is your front--

530
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,354
他妈的。呃,抱歉。
Fuck. Uh, sorry.

531
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,982
右手是汽油，也是你的前刹车。
Right hand is gas, also your front brake.

532
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,610
左手是你的，离合器。
And then left hand is your, uh, clutch.

533
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,946
右脚是你的后刹。
Right foot is your back brake.

534
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,282
左脚是移位器什么的。
And, uh, left foot is the shifter thingy.

535
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,492
简单。
Simple.

536
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,703
听起来并不简单。
Doesn't sound simple.

537
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,371
罗纳德:哟,科里!
RONALD: Yo, Corey!

538
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,498
来帮我们一把。
Come give us a hand.

539
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,291
-嘿,罗恩。-嘿,特里。
-Hey, Ron. -Hey, Terry.

540
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,043
特瑞的父亲:我很抱歉用这种破事来打扰你。
TERRY'S FATHER: I'm sorry to bother you with this shit.

541
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,254
我儿子开着辆破车开了三英里
My goddamn son drove three miles on a fucking flat

542
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,964
因为他不知道怎么换轮胎
'cause he doesn't know how to change a tire

543
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,757
在一辆该死的车上。
on a goddamn automobile.

544
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,800
该死的天才。
Fucking genius.

545
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,594
嗯…我得到了它。
Uh... I got it.

546
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,888
特瑞的父亲:是啊，而且他妈的要聪明一点。
TERRY'S FATHER: Yeah, and fucking smarten up.

547
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,348
(模糊喋喋不休持续)
(indistinct chatter continues)

548
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,852
我去帮罗纳德，然后把拨浪鼓修好。
I'm gonna go help Ronald and then fix the rattle.

549
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,437
你的喋喋不休。你的车的,嗯…
Your rattle. Your car's, uh...

550
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,982
我不关心拨浪鼓。我是来看你的。
I don't care about the rattle. I came to see you.

551
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,650
我们会照顾她的。
RONALD: We'll take care of her.

552
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,360
你得聪明点，孩子。
Just got to be a little smarter, kid.

553
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:36,072
三磅的地面吸盘，就在上面。(叹息)
Three pounds of ground chuck, right here on the top. (sighs)

554
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,074
弗兰克:谢谢。-马上回来。
-FRANK: Thank you. -Be right back with the lean.

555
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,827
天啊，弗兰克，你听说过蔬菜吗?
Jesus, Frank, have you ever heard of a vegetable?

556
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,412
看看是谁来了。
Well, look who it is.

557
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,165
(咕哝,笑)
(grunts, laughs)

558
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,833
-它们对你有好处。-嗯，我喜欢
-They're good for you. -Well, I like to

559
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,002
把肉混在一起给局里的人做炸丸子。
mix meats and make croquettes for the guys at the station.

560
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:52,213
(笑):好吧，这听起来真恶心。
(laughs): Okay, that just sounds disgusting.

561
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,092
我喜欢你的头发。
I like your hair.

562
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,927
谢谢。
Thanks.

563
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,847
谢谢。我,嗯…
Thanks. I, uh...

564
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,391
有一天我把它切了。
I just sort of chopped it one day.

565
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:06,603
只是感觉像是时间到了。
It just was-- It felt like time.

566
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,021
哇。
Wow.

567
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,314
是别人修的。
Somebody else fixed it.

568
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,690
-。-是的。
-Help. -Yeah.

569
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,025
你的瘦不见了。
There goes your lean.

570
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,735
——啊。谢谢你,特拉维斯。-祝你今天愉快。
-Ah. Thank you, Travis. -Have a good day.

571
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,612
-好的。—看丫。
-Okay. -See ya.

572
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,865
但我跟你说，我觉得我赢得了一条额外的生命。
But I tell you, I-I feel like I won an extra life.

573
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,326
毫米。我真的。
-Mm. -I really do.

574
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,203
我在当铺买了把吉他，
I got myself a guitar at the pawnshop,

575
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,913
我一直在摆弄它
and I've been fiddling around with that,

576
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,207
我侄女给了我一块罗塞塔石碑
and my niece gave me a Rosetta Stone,

577
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,001
-现在我正在学习日语。毫米。
-and now I'm learning Japanese. -Mm.

578
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,671
(日语)
(speaks Japanese)

579
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,256

我很抱歉?——“对不起?”

因为你，她不能说话!
She cannot speak because of you!

你连她的名字都不知道，对吧?

不是那个杀了所有人的人。

真正的迈克尔·迈尔斯那晚被谋杀了，

他毒死了教皇约翰·保罗一世

00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,169
你把我扔到中间，然后你…
you threw me in the middle of it, and then you...

-我…我…-你是在哪里?

733
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,757
我不知道里面发生了什么。
I didn't know what was happening in there.

734
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,218
我只是想，我只是想帮你…
I-I was just trying, I was just trying to help you to just...

735
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,386
我不是你的项目，艾莉森!
I'm not your fucking project, Allyson!

736
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,264
我只是科里，我知道!
I just-- Corey, I know!

737
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:42,475
好吧?我知道那是什么感觉
Okay? I know what it's like to have

738
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,477
每个人看着你，以为他们认识你，
everybody looking at you, thinking that they know you,

739
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,271
以为他们知道你经历了什么，
thinking that they know what you've been through,

740
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,605
但他们没有。
but they don't.

741
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:52,944
但当我看着你，那天我看到你的时候，
But when I look at you-- when I saw you the other day,

742
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,487
我只看到一个人。
I just saw a person.

743
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:57,949
只是一个想要搞清楚的人。
Just a person just trying to figure it the fuck out.

744
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,327
试着每天醒来不再害怕，不再孤单。
Trying to wake up every day not scared and alone.

745
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,415
但你我之间的区别，艾莉森
But the difference, Allyson, between me and you

746
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,917
人们看着我就像，

747
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,253
“这家伙是谁?”这个怪物是谁?”
"Who is this guy? Who is this monster?"

748
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,423
他们看着你就像他们把你当成幸存者。
And they look at you like-- They see you like a survivor.

749
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:14,841
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

750
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,594
我明白了。你从迈克尔·迈尔斯那里逃了出来。
I get it. You survived Michael Myers.

751
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,180
你是奋斗的英雄，去问别人吧。
You're a hero with your struggles, and ask anyone.

752
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,974
我是那个神经病保姆。我就是那个该死的孩子杀手。
I'm the psycho babysitter. I'm the fucking kid killer.

753
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,604
你以为你能治好我，但你不能。
And you think you can fix me, but you can't.

754
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,857
我不会让你心痛的。
I'll spare you the heartache.

科里，我在跟你说话呢。

开门。
Open the door.

——开放的大门!——(叩响门)

你想杀了我吗?
Are you trying to kill me?

科里?科里?
Corey? Corey?

黛布:对升职没有什么不满，对吧?
DEB: No hard feelings about the promotion, right?

889
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,131
当然不是。这是你应得的。
Course not. You deserve it.

890
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,008
(笑)我想肯定是马西斯医生
(chuckles) I thought for sure Dr. Mathis

891

本打算让你当护士长。

黛布，我能跟你说句话吗?
Deb, can I speak to you a minute?

罗芮:人们创造他们自己的故事

做出他们自己的选择。

00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,619
他们相信他们想相信的。
They believe what they want to believe.

我满怀希望，有远见，

(发动机转速)
(engine revs)

901
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,797
你得问问自己，我能控制吗，
You have to ask yourself, "Am I in control,

902
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,342
还是大自然控制了我?

对不起，我不是故意吓你的。
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

909
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,135
我在等艾莉森。
I'm just waiting for Allyson.

910
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,472
阿廖沙:科里?
ALLYSON: Corey?

911
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,269

我昨晚在回家的路上被袭击了。

加油站的那些孩子在耍我

我试着为自己辩护，但他们…

我来只是想和你谈谈。

我想说我很抱歉，还有…

但如果你能，求你了，如果你能

我们在做纸飞机，
We were making paper planes,

但他想看一部怪兽电影。

一切都发生得太快了。

我只想过个有趣的夜晚。
I just wanted it to be a fun night.

的,只是……一个晚安。
That's all, just... a good night.

934
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,444
然后一切都变糟了。
And then it all went bad.

935
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,617
艾莉森:我听说发生了什么事。
ALLYSON: I heard what happened.

936
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,246
我知道这听起来很疯狂，但是当…
I know it sounds crazy, but when...

937
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,958
人们会谈论它，就好像我认识你一样。
people would talk about it, it was like I knew you.

938
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,336
就像我在找你一样。
Like I was looking for you.

939
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:00,588
然后她带你来见我。
And then she brought you to me.

940
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:06,136
(高音吹口哨)
(high-pitched whistling)

941
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:10,015
他做了什么坏事吗?
Has he done something bad?

942
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,474
我不明白你为什么在这里。
I don't understand why you're here.

943
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:14,269
不,不。他在看我的孙女。

944
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,062
其实是我介绍的。
I introduced them, actually.

945

你的孙女应该很幸运
Your granddaughter should be so lucky

946
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:19,733
和科里这样的男孩在一起
as to be with a boy like Corey.

947
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,027
他很帅。他是敏感的。
He's handsome. He's sensitive.

948
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,070
(叹气)我不喜欢他呆在外面
(sighs) I don't like it when he stays out

949
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,948
夜夜笙歌，但他长大了。
all night with girls, but he's grown.

950
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,284
他可以做他想做的事。
He can do what he wants.

951
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,079
是的。
Yes.

952
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,585
我知道他有他的困难。
I know he's had his difficulties.

953
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:40,795
我的儿子。
My son.

954
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,213
整个镇子都反对他
This town turned against him

955
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:43,923
在杰里米·艾伦出事之后
after the accident with Jeremy Allen.

956
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:45,342
他们会同情他的。
They would've felt for him.

957
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:46,718
他们会帮助他痊愈的。
They would've helped him heal.

958
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,596
但因为你的恶魔消失了
But because your boogeyman disappeared,

959
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:51,639
他们需要一个新的。
they needed a new one.

960
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,645
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

961
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,691
我爸妈被杀后，
ALLYSON: After my mom and dad were killed,

962
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,943
我只想把这一切都付之一炬
I just wanted to burn it all to the ground

963
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:06,446
离哈顿菲尔德远点。-为什么不离开呢?
-and get away from Haddonfield. -Why not leave?

964
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,114
为什么留下来吗?
Why stay?

965
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,617
我所有的记忆都在这里。
All my memories are here.

966
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,162
我觉得你父母都被杀了
I think both your parents got killed

967
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,955
你奶奶为此感到内疚，
and your grandma feels guilty about it,

968
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,415
所以她要让你成为她的孩子。
so she's making you her child.

969
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,626
如果你能在治疗前见她一面，
If you could've seen her before therapy,

970
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,628
清醒了，而我…
sobering up, and me...

971
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,380
我只是害怕会发生什么事
I'm just terrified to think what would happen

972
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:25,131
如果她孤身一人如果我走了
if she were all alone if I left.

973
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:27,050
所以呢，你得留在这里，保护她
So, what, you got to stay here, protect her

974
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,635
从自己到永远吗?
from herself forever?

975
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:33,598
看起来……
Look...

976
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,017
很抱歉我在聚会上失去了理智
I'm sorry I lost my head at the party

977
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,144
我走开了。
and I walked away.

978
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,105
这是一个错误。
That was a mistake.

979
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,525
当我看着你，我…
When I look at you, I...

980
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:48,154
我知道我可以告诉你真相。
I know I can tell you the truth.

981
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:50,323
我不怕这些人。
I'm not afraid of these people.

982
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:52,492
我不再害怕了。
I'm not afraid anymore.

983
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,662
你说你想把它烧了，
You tell me that you want to burn it down,

984
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:57,580
或者你告诉我你想把它烧为平地。
or you tell me you want to burn it to the ground.

985
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,834
(呵呵):嘿。一周两次。

You were... you were gonna call, but you didn't call.

989
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,092
不，我欠你一个电话。
No, I owe you a call.

990
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,302
我是……我做错什么了吗?
Did I... did I do something wrong or...

991
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:12,721
我与某人。

1138

1144
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,489
说实话，这让我很生气。
which, if I'm honest, pissed me off.

1145
01:00:56,531 --> 01:00:59,743
因为我觉得他们带走了我的痛苦…
Because I felt like they took my pain...

1146

.．.我的绝望,
...my despair,

01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,711
然后，昨天，我在上班的路上。
And then, yesterday, I'm on my way to work.

他就在这里。
There he is.

我才不在乎你的社交地位

1191

你所需要的只是你脸上的表情

你为什么不用你的眼睛告诉我呢

Holy shit. (clicks tongue)

1200
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,184
家里有医生吗?
Is there a doctor in the house?

1201
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:33,813
*如果你想要一次，就和我一次，妈妈*
* If you wanna one time, one time with me, mama *

1202
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:35,190
是的,宝贝。好吧。

得到了奶酪。我们有饼干。

科里:事故发生后，
COREY: After the accident,

1238
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:51,594
我会骑着自行车过来，坐在屋顶上。
I'd ride my bike over here and I'd sit up on this roof.

1239
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:56,182
我抬头看着那座塔。
And I'd look up at that tower.

1240
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:58,226
不知道我能不能爬到山顶。
Wonder if I could climb to the top.

1241
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:01,521
它在召唤我。
It was summoning me.

1242
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:05,775
就像瞭望塔或灯塔在召唤我回到过去的生活。
Like a watchtower or beacon calling me to live my old life.

1243
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,068
重新快乐起来。
To be happy again.

1244
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,196
把它烧了
* Burn it down *

1245
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:13,742
我也有类似的东西。
I have something like that, too.

1246
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:17,579
它总是给我希望，你知道，事情会
It always gave me hope, you know, things would--

1247
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,497
也许一切都能回到过去
well, maybe somehow things would go back

1248
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:21,666
回到他们过去的样子。
to the way they used to be.

Before everything changed.

我得远离所有认识我的人。

我不想一个人去。
I don't want to go alone.

科里,来吧。
Corey, come on.

-(chuckles) -Stop.

1257
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:54,157
我觉得你是害怕没有足够的绷带
I think you're scared that you don't have enough bandages

1258
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:55,992
让我振作起来。
to keep me together.

1259
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,118
科里，你在…?!
Corey, what are you...?!

-(laughing) -Are you okay?

1262
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,543
怎么，你疯了吗?
What, are you insane?

1263
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,379
怎么，你想自杀吗?
What, are you trying to kill yourself?

1264
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,464
我对永生不感兴趣。
I'm not interested in immortality.

这到底是怎么回事?
The hell is going on out here?

1269
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:21,393
这是私人领地。
Yo, this is private property.

1270
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:23,895
不管你做什么都不安全…
Not safe to be doing whatever the hell you do...

科里坎宁安。

你在外面干什么，你个丑八怪?
What you doing out here, you ugly motherfucker?

1273

Corey，别说了。-你会吓到所有的孩子。
-ALLYSON: Corey, stop it. -You gonna scare all the kids.

1274
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:32,445
你停止。
You stop.

1275
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:36,324
我不知道你在跟谁说话，
I don't know who the fuck you talking to,

1276
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:39,828
但我知道你是谁
but, uh, I know who you are.

1277
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:42,789
我知道劳里·斯特罗德的事。
Yeah, I know the Laurie Strode story.

1278
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:47,168
她取笑一个脑损伤的男人，然后他就崩溃了。
She teased a man with brain damage, and then he snapped.

1279
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,712
看看你。
Look at you.

01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:50,797
你现在想出名了吗?

和这个蠢婊子在一起。
Walking around with this dumb bitch right here.

爱莉森:你从来不闭嘴。

到处都能听到他的声音。
Hear his voice everywhere.

01:08:55,468 --> 01:08:57,429
你他妈说对了。
Oh, you're goddamn right you do.

一旦威利进入你的耳朵，
And once Willie get in your ear,

1286

就像你最喜欢的歌在你脑海里挥之不去。

1292
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:16,656
你是对的。
You're right.

1293
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:19,284
让我们做它。
Let's do it.

1294
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,995
我不想再待在哈顿菲尔德了。
I don't want to be in Haddonfield anymore.

1295
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:23,997

JOAN: (sniffs) I can smell her on you.

1298
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:46,311
她想把你从我身边夺走，是吗?
She's trying to take you away from me, isn't she?

1299
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,021
你每天晚上都去那里。
That's where you go every night.

1300
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:50,774
好吧，我说去吧。
Well, I say go.

滚出我的房子!
Get out of my house!

1303
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:01,785
哦,不。不。
Oh, no. No.

1304
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:13,421
我希望你找到真爱。
I hope you find love.

罗芮:很高兴见到你。
LAURIE: It's nice to see you.

1311
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:57,757
你知道，有两种邪恶。
You know, there are two kinds of evil.

1312
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,595
一种是作为外部力量存在的邪恶
There's the evil that exists as an external force

1313
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:05,473
这威胁到部落的福祉。
that threatens the well-being of the tribe.

1314
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:10,979
生存取决于理解和意识
Survival depends on understanding and awareness

1315
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:15,567
以及对日常生活的身体威胁的恐惧。
and fear of physical threat to our daily lives.

1316
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:18,653
另一种邪恶存在于我们体内。
The other kind of evil lives inside us.

1317
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:23,491
比如疾病或感染。
Like a sickness or an infection.

1318
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:29,539
更危险的是我们可能不知道自己被感染了
It's more dangerous because we may not know we're infected.

1319
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,501
(又慢又有节奏的敲击声继续)
(slow, rhythmic knocking continues)

1320
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:37,922
我是个坏人吗?
Am I a bad person?

1321
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:39,966
(笑)
(laughs)

1322
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:41,926
是吗?
Are you?

1323
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:43,511
嗯…
Well...

1324
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:47,474
.．.我们都是满不在乎的。
...we're both fucked-up.

1325
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:51,853
我想帮你，科里。(笑)
-I want to help you, Corey. -(chuckles)

1326
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:53,146
让我来帮你。
Let me help you.

1327
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,315
或者让我帮你找帮手。
Or let me find help for you.

1328
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:56,858
你不能拥有她。
You can't have her.

1329
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,819
艾莉森不适合这段感情，
Allyson is not equipped for this relationship,

1330
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:02,113
我不会让她受到伤害的
and I will not let her get hurt.

1331
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:04,074
所以离我远点…
So stay the fuck away...

1332
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:05,950
你开始这个!
You started this!

1333
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:08,870
是你带我来的!你邀请我!
You brought me in! You invited me!

1334
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:13,375
但你才是罪魁祸首。
But you're the one to blame.

1335
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:17,879
“你想做，还是你想让我做?”
"You want to do it, or you want me to?"

1336
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,964
* *

1337
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,388
如果我不能拥有她…
If I can't have her...

1338
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,891
.．.没有人会。
...no one will.

1339
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:35,480
你想帮艾莉森吗?让她过她自己的生活。
You want to help Allyson? Let her live her life.

1340
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:40,568
她现在有我了。
She has me now.

1341
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:49,494
你应该让步。
You should give in.

1342
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,540
你应该向你的那种感觉屈服
You should surrender to that feeling you had

1343
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,084
你第一次看着他的眼睛。
the first time you ever looked into his eyes.

1344
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,633
你暗地里希望迈克尔回来找你。
You secretly hope Michael comes back for you.

1345
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:09,139
(笑)
(chuckles)

1346
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,099
我是神经病。
I'm the psycho.

1347
01:13:12,183 --> 01:13:14,436
你才是怪胎。
You're the freak show.

1348
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:17,063

1349
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,130
(玩断然指出)
(notes play flatly)

1350
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,640
怎么了?
What's wrong?

1351
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:53,767
科里(在电话里):我们得走了。
COREY (over phone): We need to leave.

1352
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:56,603
现在不行。我的工作。
I can't right now. I'm working.

1353
01:13:56,644 --> 01:13:58,772
科里:今晚,然后。
COREY: Tonight, then.

1354
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:02,609
9点见好吗?
Will you meet me at 9:00?

1355
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:04,903
在74街的餐厅。
At the diner off 74.

1356
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,155
我们得谈谈你祖母的事。
We need to talk about your grandmother.

1357
01:14:08,656 --> 01:14:11,117
她想杀了我。
She wants to kill me.

1358
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,078
-什么?-是的。
-What? -Yeah.

1359
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,121
我再也受不了了。
I can't take it anymore.

1360
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:17,916
是时候和哈顿菲尔德说再见了。
It's time to say goodbye to Haddonfield.

1361
01:14:20,293 --> 01:14:23,046
(科里喘气)
(Corey panting)

1362
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:26,800
你有我需要的东西。
You got something I need.

1363
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:30,679
(的)
(both grunting)

1364
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:50,490
(科里大叫呻吟)
(Corey shouts, groans)

1365
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:53,868
你只是个戴着万圣节面具的人。
You're just a man in a Halloween mask.

1366
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:55,662
你现在打算怎么办?
What are you gonna do now?

1367
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:58,331
(喘着粗气)
(both breathing heavily)

1368

-(嬉戏的闲聊)-(蟋蟀的唧唧声)
-(playful chatter) -(crickets chirping)

1371
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,603
比利:稍后给他打电话。
-(entry bell chimes) -BILLY: Call him after.

1372
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:21,896
我不想去你家，伙计。
I don't want to go to your house, man.

1373
01:15:21,938 --> 01:15:23,273
你爸总是对我们大吼大叫。
Your dad always fucking yells at us.

1374
01:15:23,314 --> 01:15:24,733
太他妈的坏。你应该有你自己的。
Too fucking bad. You should've got your own.

1375
01:15:24,774 --> 01:15:26,359
反正也不应该有这些东西。
Shouldn't have any of these anyway.

1376
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:28,028
为什么我们不能去她家?她才是那个有钱的人。
Why can't we go to her house? She's the one that's rich.

1377
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:29,195
-哦,什么?是的。开枪。什么鬼?
-Oh, what? Yeah. Shoot. -TERRY: What the fuck?

1378
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:31,031
什么?
What?

1379
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:32,282
(引擎的转速)
(engine revving)

1380
01:15:34,242 --> 01:15:36,119
他死了!进入!
He's dead! Get in!

1381
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,579
哦,狗屎。大便。
Oh, shit. Shit.

1382
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:54,262
你找到要找的东西了吗?
Did you find what you're looking for?

1383
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:56,598
我想你的旅行一定很愉快。
I imagine you're going on a wonderful trip.

1384
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,477
-你打算告诉我吗?有什么区别吗?
-Were you gonna tell me? -What difference does it make?

1385
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:01,895
这很重要，艾莉森。
It makes a big difference, Allyson.

1386
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:04,731
我觉得他有能力造成真正的伤害。
I feel he is capable of real harm.

1387
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,983
这是困扰你的吗?
Is that what bothers you?

1388
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:10,904
是怀疑还是妄想?
Is it suspicion or paranoia?

1389
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:12,906
直觉吗?一个暗示吗?
Intuition? An inkling?

1390
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:14,157
你知道吗?
You got an inkling?

1391
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,618
我去了他家。我见到了他的母亲。
I went to his home. I met his mother.

1392
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,912
我知道。他告诉我。
I know. He told me.

1393
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:21,581
所以,你是什么?你现在跟踪他了?
So, you're what? You're stalking him now?

1394
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,166
-不。-你在威胁他。
-No. -And you're threatening him.

1395
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:25,627
-你对他说了什么?-我在他身上看到了同样的东西
-What did you say to him? -I-I see the same thing in him

1396
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,921
-我在迈克尔身上看到的。迈克尔。
-that I saw in Michael. -Michael.

1397
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:29,673
迈克尔·迈尔斯就是你。
Michael Myers is who you are.

1398
01:16:29,714 --> 01:16:31,549
你没听我说，艾莉森
You're not listening to me, Allyson.

1399
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:32,926
我是在保护你。
I am trying to protect you.

1400
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,427
我不需要你的保护!
I don't want your protection!

1401
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:38,556
但你可以过上好日子，艾莉森。
But you-you can have a good life, Allyson.

1402
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:39,891
一个好的生活。
A good life.

1403
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:41,685
只是不是和他。
Just not with him.

1404
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:44,771
你假装你已经向前看了，但这都是扯淡。
You pretend like you moved on, but it's bullshit.

1405
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,481
你只是对死亡着迷
You're actually just obsessed with death,

1406
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:47,899
就像一场游戏。
like it's some sort of game.

1407
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:49,609
不完成任务你是不会休息的
And you're not gonna rest until you've finished it

1408
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,237
或者直到所有人都像你一样痛苦!
or until everybody else is as fucking miserable as you are!

1409
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:54,948
我得在这镇子杀人之前离开这里
I need to get out of here before this town kills

1410
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:57,826
唯一一个让我有感觉的人。
the one person that actually makes me feel something.

1411
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,955
-他走在一条黑暗的道路上!(叹息)
-He is on a dark path! -(sighs)

1412
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:03,623
我不会让这种事发生在你身上!
I'm not gonna let this happen to you!

1413
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:05,166
你一定要相信我!
You have to believe me!

1414
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:07,919
相信你?
Believe you?

1415
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,963
你想让我相信你?
You want me to believe you?

1416
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,091
因为你引起的歇斯底里
Because of the hysteria that you caused

1417
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:16,761
当我信任你的时候，我的朋友们都死了。
when I trusted you, my friends are dead.

1418
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:18,304
我的父母都死了。
My parents are dead.

1419
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:22,267
你才是那个会伤害别人的人!
You're the one that's capable of fucking harm!

1423
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,406
比利:你确定他是在这里转过来的吗，伙计?
BILLY: You sure he turned in here, dude?

1424
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:38,033
特瑞:是啊，好像是他的藏身处。
TERRY: Yeah, it's like his hideout or something.

1425
01:17:38,074 --> 01:17:39,492
那是他工作的地方。
It's where he works.

1426
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:42,120
-他的作品很烂。-实际上是垃圾场。
-His work is a dump. -It actually is a dump.

1427
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:43,955
史黛西:(咯咯地笑)好吧，不，说真的，他在哪儿?
STACY: (chuckles) Okay, no, but seriously, where is he?

1428
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,290
-特瑞:那是自行车。-该死，哥们，靠边停车。
-TERRY: There's the bike. -Shit, dude, pull over.

1429
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:47,917
史黛西:这太疯狂了。
STACY: This is gonna be so crazy.

1430
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,837
小的走了。比利，你能快点吗?
-Let's go. -MARGO: Billy, can you hurry up?

1431
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,464
科里!你是压扁我。
-Corey! -You're squishing me.

1432
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,174
-上帝。——他去了?
-God. -Where'd he go?

1433
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:55,383
出来,科里!
Come out, Corey!

1434
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,262
科里，我只想吻你和好，伙计!
Corey, I just want to kiss and make up, my man!

1435
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:00,930
-来吧!-别当废物了!
-Come on! -Stop being a punk!

1436
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:02,849
——(singsongy):科里!-你在哪儿，伙计?
-(singsongy): Corey! -Where you at, man?

1437
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:05,101
我让你看看你弄坏我爸爸的车会有什么后果!
I'll show you what happens when you mess with my dad's car!

1438
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:06,978
-我们能快点吗，伙计?
-(laughs) -Can we hurry this up, man?

1439
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,524
哦，我有个主意。
Oh, I got an idea.

1440
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:14,152
比利，倒车。
Billy, back the car up.

1441
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:15,111

抓住链。我们走吧。
Grab that chain. Let's go.

1443
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:19,366
特里，办公室里有人。
MARGO: Terry, there's somebody in the office.

1444
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:20,867
别犯贱了。
Stop being a chickenshit.

1445
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,452
把它放在轮子上。好吧?
Run it through the wheel. All right?

1446
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:24,454
我们要把它绑在车后面，
We're gonna tie it to the back of the car,

1447
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,498
然后拖它，直到什么都不剩。
and then we'll drag it till there's nothing left.

1448
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,084
Dusty-ass自行车。
Dusty-ass bike.

1449
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:32,003
——(笑)大便。
-(laughs) -Shit.

1450
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:34,756
小的,比利。比利!头里,特里。快点,伙计。
-Let's go, Billy. Billy! -Come on, Terry. Hurry up, man.

1451
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,758
曾经有人在这里。比利!
-Someone's here. -Billy!

1452
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:41,096
来吧,比利!让我们抓住这个混蛋!
Come on, Billy! Let's get this punk!

1453
01:18:41,137 --> 01:18:42,055
我们走吧!
Let's go!

1454

哦,我的上帝。比利。
Oh, my God. Billy.

1455
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:46,226
比利，你想干什么，伙计?吸自己的……
Billy, what are you trying to do, man? Suck your own...

1456
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:47,811
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

-你在说什么?(引擎开始)
-What are you talking about?! -(engine starts)

1463
