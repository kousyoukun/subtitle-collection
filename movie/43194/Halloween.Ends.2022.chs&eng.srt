你应该考虑一些常绿植物。

好，我会试试看的，小家伙。
Yeah, I'll sure give it a shot, little dude.

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,500
你会乖乖听科里先生的话吗？
 You gonna be good for Mr. Corey?

56
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,110
科里 我能和你聊几句？-当然。
-Corey. Could I talk to you for a sec? -Yeah.

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,940
雷霆轰炸机来了!
Here comes the Thunder Bomber!

58
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,010
我去把糖果放在门口走廊上。

她做了西葫芦面包。挺好吃的。

-你有我手机号码。
 -You have my number.

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,860
-嗯。-如果有急事就打给我
-Okay. -If there's an emergency,

64
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,650
但我们其实就在街尾那边。
but we'll just be right down the street.

65
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,480
坠机了！
Crash!

66
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,860
我还得再叮嘱你一句。
And there is one thing I need to tell you.

67
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,700
自从上个万圣节，迈克尔·迈尔斯做的那些事，
Since last Halloween-- all the events and,

68
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,200
你知道，还有那些报道
you know, the headlines of Michael Myers--

69
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
杰里米很怕黑。
Jeremy's been afraid of the dark.

70
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,460
他晚上会尿床。
He's been wetting the bed at night.

71
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,040
所以，额，他还挺难入眠的
And, um, bedtime has been difficult.

72
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,460
我能听见你们说话！
 I can hear you!

73
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,170
我可以给他读点睡前故事啥的。
Uh, I can read him a story or something.

74
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,880
他有什么喜欢的书吗？-然后等他睡觉了
-Does he have a favorite book? -Then once he goes to bed,

75
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,250
他会说梦话。
he talks in his sleep.

76
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,140
他说他能听到某种声音。
Says he hears voices.

77
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,720
他只是对那些让他做噩梦的事
He's just really sensitive to things

78
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,550
特别敏感。-好吧，这些听起来
-that give him bad dreams. -Right. All that just sounds

79
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,430
就像是小孩子自己胡思乱想的玩意，对吧？
like normal kid imagination stuff, right?

80
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,270
不要看电视，不要给他吃糖。
-No TV and no more candy.

81
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,110
你们可以玩到八点半或八点四十五的样子。
You guys can play till 8:30, 8:45.

82
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,440
然后他就该上床睡觉了。
Then he should go to bed.

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
这钱好赚。-是的。
-Easy money. -Yes.

84
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,360
你要不要跟我一起玩？
 Gonna come play with me or what?

85
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,450
-这听起来像是在威胁我。
-That sounds like a threat.

86
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,240
万圣节嘛。
It's Halloween.

87
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,580
今晚我们会玩得很开心的。
We're gonna have a good time tonight.

88
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,750
哦。
 Oh.

89
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,210
听着，伙计，如果你
Look, man, we can

90
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,420
害怕看怪兽电影，我们可以关掉不看。
shut it off if you're scared of monster movies.

91
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,630
我才不 害怕的是你。
No. No. You're scared.

92
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,210
我都21岁了。我可不怕。
I'm 21 years old. I don't get scared.

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,900
你害怕 因为你知道迈克尔·迈尔斯...
You're scared because you know Michael Myers is...

94
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,850
还逍遥法外

95
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,560
恶魔人要来抓你了哦。
Boogeyman's gonna get you.

96
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,380
他抓不到我的。
 He's not gonna get me.

97
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,730
迈克尔·迈尔斯只杀保姆，不杀孩子。
Michael Myers kills babysitters, not kids.

98
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,950
好了，这画面也挺恶心的
Okay, that's actually pretty disgusting

99
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,950
小孩不该看这些。
and probably not appropriate for kids.

100
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,620
要不我们还是把电视关了 然后…
Why don't we shut this off, and...

101
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,040
上床前可以玩玩捉迷藏。
we can play hide-and-seek before bed.

102
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,620
你爸妈就快回家了…
Your parents are gonna be home soon and...

103
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,610
我才不想玩捉迷藏。
I don't want to play no hide-and-seek.

104
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,380
太蠢了。我想继续看这部电影。
It's stupid. I want to watch this movie.

105
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,120
我也不想和一个丑不拉几的男保姆
 And I don't really feel like pretending to be best friends 。

106
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,980
 装作是好朋友
with an ugly-ass boy babysitter.

107
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,640
好吧，再看五分钟，然后你就得上床了。
Okay, five minutes, and then you're going to bed.

108
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,870
你这保姆真差劲。
You suck at babysitting.

109
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,720
我又不是保姆。
I'm not a babysitter.

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,300
杰里米！
Jeremy!

111
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,550
关掉电影！
Turn that movie off!

112
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,640
杰里米？
Jeremy?

113
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,060
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

114
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,800
杰里米？
Jeremy?

115
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,310
杰里米！
Jeremy!

116
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,350
杰里米？
Jeremy?

117
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,190
快出来，不管你在哪里，快出来吧。
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

118
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,510
这不好玩，杰里米。
This isn't funny, Jeremy.

119
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,290
杰里米！
Jeremy!

120
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,930
杰里米？
Jeremy?

121
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,220
快救我！科里，救我！
 Help! Corey, help!

122
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,530
杰里米？
 Jeremy?

123
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,460
杰里米？
 Jeremy?

124
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,250
杰里米？
Jeremy?

125
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,540
他会抓到你的！
 He's gonna get you!

126
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,650
他会趁你不备时抓到你的。
He's gonna get you when you least expect it.

127
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,520
-你是不是该睡觉了，科里？-别闹了,杰里米…
Is it your bedtime, Corey? -Okay, Jeremy...

128
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,570
“不管你在哪，你快出来吧，出来吧。”
"Come out, come out, wherever you are."

129
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,570
你赢了兄弟，别闹了，放我出来
You got me, buddy. Okay, let me out.

130
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,030
你怕了吗？-开门好吗？
Are you scared? -Okay?

131
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,950
“我都21岁了。我才不怕。”
 "I'm 21. I'm not scared."

132
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,320
杰里米，快开门，放我出去！
Jeremy, let me out. Let me out!

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,130
你个小杂种！快放我出去！
You little shit! Let me out of here!

134
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,510
迈克尔·迈尔斯。
 Michael Myers.

135
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,600
-杰里米，这不好玩，别闹了好吗？
-Jeremy, it's not funny, okay?

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,210
你会给咱俩都惹上麻烦的。
 you're gonna get us both in trouble.

137
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,800
放我出去！放我出去！放我出去！快放我出去！
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!

138
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,840
小杂种！
You little shit!

139
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,210
我会杀了你的，杰里米！
-I'm gonna kill you, Jeremy!

140
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,730
这是怎么回事？
What was that?

141
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,800
杰里米！
Jeremy!

142
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,410
-哦,不！哦,天呐！拜托！-杰里米！
-Oh, no! Oh, God! Please! -Jeremy!

143
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,770
-哦,不。哦,天呐。-杰里米!
-Oh, no. Oh, God. - Jeremy!

144
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,070
天呐！杰里米！
Oh, my God! Jeremy!

145
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,760
-杰里米。杰里米!
-Jeremy. -Jeremy!

146
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,810
天呐，不要啊！
God, please, no!

147
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,000
你都干了些什么？
What have you done?

148
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,180
哈顿菲尔德是一座祥和的小镇。
 Haddonfield was a peaceful town.

149
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,770
但在许多年前的一个万圣节夜晚，
And then one Halloween night many years ago,

150
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,090
这片祥和就此打破。
all of that was lost.

151
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,140
迈克尔·迈尔斯是邪恶得到化身。
Michael Myers was pure evil.

152
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,830
他夺走了我们的梦想
He took our dreams

153
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,490
将其化为梦魇。
and turned them into nightmares.

154
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,040
在他身陷牢狱时…
As he was locked away in his prison...

155
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,630
...我也隐归他处。
...I disappeared into mine.

156
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,770
之后，正如我所料，
And then, as I predicted,

157
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,630
40年后，他成功越狱
40 years later, he escaped,

158
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,900
哈顿菲尔德不得不再一次对抗
and Haddonfield was once again forced to confront

159
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,980
这个戴着面具的恶魔。
this man in a mask.

160
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,910
他冷血无情地摧残了我的社区...
His senseless brutality ravaged my community...

161
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,120
...还杀了我的女儿。
...and killed my daughter.

162
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,300
在那之后 他便查无踪迹了。
And then he vanished.

163
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,190
觉得不可能吗？
Impossible?

164
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,610
或许如此。
Perhaps.

165
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,250
当人们找寻其杀人动机和意义时
Truth would evolve into legend

166
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,390
真相往往逐渐变为传说，
as people searched for motive and meaning,

167
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,520
人们只得在阴暗之中找寻恶魔人的踪影。
looking in the shadows for their boogeyman.

168
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,650
这是场意外。
It was an accident.

169
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,640
在接下来的几年里，
In the years that followed,

170
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:14,010
悲痛，责备，猜疑如瘟疫一般席卷登菲尔德，让镇里居民人心惶惶。
the people of Haddonfield descended into a plague  of grief, of blame, of paranoia.

171
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,210
你觉得他还会回来吗?
Do you think he's come back?

172
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,700
迈克尔从不用枪。
Michael doesn't use guns.

173
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,700
迈克尔造成的苦难
The suffering Michael caused

174
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,920
哪怕是从未招惹过他的人
became an infection passing on to people

175
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,660
都会闻之色变
who never even crossed his path.

176
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,980
当小镇自顾不暇时，
And as the town turned in on itself,

177
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,580
我暗自发誓不再屈从于恐惧。
I made a promise not to let fear rule my life anymore.

178
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,980
我购置了一处房产。
I bought a home.

179
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,250
搭筑起充满爱与信任的家。
A place to live with love and trust.

180
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,790
这里既不是陷阱。
Not a trap.

181
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,110
更不是藏身之所。
Not a place to hide.

182
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,610
嘿。
Hey.

183
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,040
自我上次见那恶魔起，已经过去四年了
It has been four years, since I last saw my monster.

184
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,420
如今我在这里，以幸存者的身份分享我的经历
So here I am, a survivor attempting to share my story

185
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,600
并寻得慰藉。
and find healing.

186
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,260
迈克尔·迈尔斯就是恶魔的化身。
Michael Myers was the personification of evil.

187
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,400
这是他们的。
It's theirs.

188
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,270
这是他们的婚戒。
It's their wedding rings.

189
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,650
一切都取决于我们
It's up to each of us

190
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,680
无论是现在锁上门
whether or not we lock the door

191
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,110
去找解决对策…
and find our resolve...

192
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,820
...还是让他进门。
...or let him inside.

193
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,420
让“它”进门。
Let it inside.

194
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,660
让恶魔…
Let evil...

195
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,260
进门。
inside.

196
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,610
艾莉森！该死的！
Allyson! Darn it!

197
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,320
-亲爱的，非常抱歉！-那是什么声音？
-Honey, I'm so sorry! -What is it?

198
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,420
哦,该死！
Oh, fuck!

199
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,480
呃，是我做的派。我把派放进烤箱了。
Um, it's my pie. I put a pie in the oven.

200
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,240
哦,该死！
Oh, shit!

201
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,610
我肯定是忘记定时了。
Oh, I must have forgotten to set the timer.

202
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,320
真该死！
Damn it!

203
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,830
该死！不，不，不，不，哦，不。
Darn it! No, no, no, no, Oh, no.

204
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,510
我可以从商店买一个派回来。
I can get a pie from the store.

205
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,080
不行！我想亲手给你烤个南瓜派。
No! I wanted to bake you a pumpkin pie.

206
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,790
这是万圣节的传统。
It's a Halloween tradition.

207
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
-你是不是… -我得走了。
-Are you... -I got to go.

208
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,090
-上班要迟到了。-好吧。
-I'm late for work. -Okay.

209
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,050
你带了去派对要穿的服装没？
But do you have your costume for the party?

210
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,100
我告诉过你，我自己一个人的话就不去了。
I told you, I don't want to go alone.

211
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,930
所以我不去了。
So I'm not going.

212
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,630
哦。
Oh.

213
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,160
这里是W.U.R.G 94.9
 WURG 94.9.

214
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,880
现在为您带来威利小子的【冲动】。
Giving you the Urge, with Willie the Kid.

215
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,440
哈顿菲尔德是摇滚之家。
Haddonfield's home for rock.

216
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,920
还有四天就是万圣节了。
 It is four days until Halloween.

217
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,660
-你能相信吗？
-Can you believe it?

218
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,450
是时候锁好你的门，拿起刀准备战斗了。
It's time to lock your doors, grab your knife for the fight.

219
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,980
准备好了吗？要是恶魔人
You ready? You ready in case

220
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,610
决定出来寻欢作恶 你准备好了吗？
the Boogeyman decides to come out and play?

221
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,110
反正我准备好了。
I know I am.

222
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,810
不过我们得先谈谈迈克尔·迈尔斯。
But let's talk about that Michael Myers for a minute.

223
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,420
这个人是怎么中枪，中刀的
How does one man get shot at, stabbed up

224
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,260
摔落街头后 还能卷土重来
and then he fall down the street and get back up

225
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,180
让哈顿菲尔德内每个人都闻风丧胆呢？
to scare the piss out of everybody in Haddonfield?

226
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,800
让我来为你揭晓答案--‘因为它根本不是人’。
Let me tell you how-- 'cause this isn't a man'.

227
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,680
它远超与人。他就是一头野兽。
This is more than a man. This is a beast.

228
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,520
一头不会流血的野兽…
One that doesn't bleed...

229
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,480
我很确定变更订单里写了。
I'm pretty sure that was in the change order.

230
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,730
稍等一下，香农。
Hold-hold on a second, Shannon.

231
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,570
嘿，科里，你迟到了！
Hey, Corey, you're late!

232
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,530
你又迟到了！
You're late again!

233
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,570
已经四年了。
It's been four years.

234
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,530
你们又在哪里？
Where y'all at?

235
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,490
是不是在为这个大日子做准备
Training for the big day, perhaps?

236
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,570
打起十二分精神？
Getting yourself in the spirit?

237
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,620
恶魔人只不过还在蛰伏中，
This Boogeyman been sitting in hibernation,

238
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,630
相信我，他会回来的。
but trust me, y'all, he'll be back.

239
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,040
我是威利小子，无限恐怖尽在
I'm Willie the Kid, and I'll be creeping it real

240
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,020
W.U.R.G电台94.9频道…
on 94.9 WUR...

241
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,380
科里，有空来一下吗?
Corey, you got a second?

242
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

243
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,550
还行。
Yeah.

244
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,130
给它上个牌照。
Get it registered.

245
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,210
换点新零件。
Get some new plates.

246
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,670
-我已经不需要它了。-你是认真的吗？
-I got no use for it no more. -Are you serious?

247
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,110
有这么好的引擎带着你，
With a good engine pushing you,

248
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,170
你就能按时上班了，你你懂我意思吧？
finally make it to work on time, you know what I mean?

249
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,850
它还能开动吗？
Does it work?

250
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,320
能啊，就是状态烂了些。
Yeah, it works, just kind of shitty.

251
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,380
嘿，罗纳德？
Hey, uh, Ronald?

252
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,150
谢了。
Thanks.

253
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,870
不客气，孩子。
No problem, kid.

254
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,770
你被捕了。
You're under arrest.

255
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,970
你是我见过最漂亮的女孩。
For being the prettiest girl I know.

256
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,430
谢谢你,道格。
That's nice, Doug.

257
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,670
这就是你让我靠边停的原因吗？
Is that why you pulled me over?

258
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,910
不是。我叫你停车是因为我想你了。
No. I pulled you over 'cause I miss you.

259
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,870
你想我吗？
You miss me?

260
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,160
开个玩笑。
Just kidding.

261
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,570
让你停车是因为
Pulled you over 'cause it looks like

262
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,740
你车上的消音器看起来快掉了
your muffler's about to fall off.

263
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,450
你最好去修一下
Better get that fixed before you have a bigger

264
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,540
-免得以后碰到更大的麻烦
-problem on your hands.

265
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,460
* 海中的怪物啊*

我们是高中生
We're seniors, okay?

292
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,520
我们为了这场演出 练习了一整年了。
We've been practicing for our show the whole year, you know.

293

We were just hoping you could be a cool new friend, you know.

296

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,160
不行吗？
No?

300
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,410
你是说“不 谢了”那种不吗？

你就是那个疯子保姆。
You're that psycho babysitter.

306

他杀了那个孩子，是不是？

307
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,990
-没错。-有胆杀孩子

308
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,370
-却没胆帮我们买酒吗？-伙伴们
-to buy us some fucking beer? - Guys, you know what?

309
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,620
要不咱们还是算了吧。
Let's just fucking forget about it.

310
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,300
就直接去参加活动吧，好吗？
Let's just go to the game, okay?

311
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,620
-你就是个可悲的恋童癖。-看看他。
-You're just a little pedo. -Look at him.

312
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,660
-让他知道知道厉害，泰瑞。-你算个什么东西？
-Let him know, Terry. -That what you are?

313
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,910
不他妈就是一个小变态 恋童癖吗?
A little fucking pedo creep?

314
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,370
-没错。给他点颜色看看，泰瑞。
-That's right. -Get in his face, Terry.

315
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,960
你算个什么变态小子啊？
What kind of fucked-up kid are you?

316
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,180
-说得对。-没错。-你接下来准备杀谁啊？
-That's right. -Right. -So where's your next victim?

317
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,840
-哇哦！-什么鬼？!
-Whoa! -What the fuck?

318
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,970
你在跟我开玩笑吗，老兄?
Are you kidding me, man?

319
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,250
-该死。
- Oh, shit.

320
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,470
-看看你。-什么鬼啊，泰瑞？

把牛奶洒了一地。
Got fucking milk everywhere.

322
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,600
- 该死。- 看看你干了什么。
- Holy shit. - Look what you did.

323
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,060
嘿！混蛋！
Hey! Assholes!

324
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,740
住手！
Knock it off!

325
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,160
- 我们什么都没做。- 我们就是聊聊天，女士。
-We're not doing anything. -We're just talking, miss.

326
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,150
- 我们闹着玩呢。- 女士。
-We're messing around. -Ma'am.

327
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,690
- 嘿，伙计们。
-Hey, guys.

328
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,730
瞧一瞧 看一看?
Would you look at this?

329
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,440
一个疯子遇上一个怪胎。
I mean, a psycho meets a freak show.

330
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,780
- 哇。- 简直不敢相信啊。
-Wow. -Can't believe it.

331
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,400
你们俩简直事天作之合的一对。
This is a match made in heaven.

332
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,450
- 嘿,拜托。看着我。- 就先这样吧。
-Hey, come on. Look at me. -Ta-ta for now.

333
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,610
走吧，伙伴们。
Let's go, y'all.

334
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,500
迈克尔·迈尔斯。
Michael Myers.

335
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,460
你是疯子还是怪胎啊？
Are you the psycho or the freak show?

336
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,180
嘿，玛戈，你想去看周六的学校演出吗?
Hey, Margo, do you want to go to the school play on Saturday?

337
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,210
- 当然 泰瑞。- 玩得开心啊。
-Yeah, sure, Terry. -Have fun.

338
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,720
你想亲自动手 还是让我来？
So, do you want to do it, or you want me to?

339
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,460
你看看
Look at it.

340
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,460
你在开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding?

341
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,610
你戴起来超级好看的。
It looks great on you.

342
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,030
我知道，但我不准备去啊。
I'm sure it does, but I'm not going.

343
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,950
把整套都穿上，你肯定喜欢。
Once you put the whole outfit on, you'll love it.

344
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,240
要我说啊 无性感不万圣
I say if it's not sexy, it's not Halloween.

345
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,380
看起来某个人已经准备好要过节啦
Well, someone's getting into the spirit of things.

346
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,790
这位先生刚刚出了点意外 需要包扎一下
This gentleman had an accident and needs a little fix-up.

347
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,500
你的伤口有点发炎
You have significant inflammation.

348
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,130
我会问轻一些 给你伤口打点麻药
Um, I'm gonna be nice and numb it here

349
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,070
我的助手就能好好给你清理
so my assistant can clean it up really well,

350
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,680
然后再回来 把伤口缝合起来
and then I will get back and close it with a suture.

351
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,520
你可能会感觉有点刺痛
You're gonna feel a little bit of a pinch here.

352
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,710
好看吧？
Cute, isn't she?

353
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,070
我没有...啊
I don't-- Ow!

354
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,320
不好意思 不好意思
Sorry. Sorry.

355
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,900
- 我很抱歉 太对不起了 - 艾莉森，你在搞什么鬼？
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Allyson, what are you doing?

356
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,280
-是我的错。对不起 - 艾莉森
- It's my fault. Sorry. -Allyson!

357
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,400
- 别 - 对不起 对不起。
-No.  -Sorry, sorry.

358
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,150
不 不 是我的错 是我的问题
No. No, my fault. It was my fault.

359
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
-我很抱歉 天啊 - 乱七八糟的
-I-I'm so sorry. Oh, geez. - What a mess.

360
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,450
赶快收拾干净 拿一套无菌工具来
Just clean it up and get a goddamn sterile kit.

361
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,270
然后给他打一针破伤风
And give him a tetanus shot.

362
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,180
我过会再来
I'll be back.

363
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,510
你不能让他这么跟你说话
You shouldn't let that guy talk to you like that.

364
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,870
即使你自己不这么觉得 但这会让你很难受的
It's gonna make you sad, even if you don't think it does.

365
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,640
我曾和更过分的人相处过
I've dealt with much worse.

366
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,580
但是多谢你了
But thank you.

367
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,520
不过 我已经习惯了
Anyway, I've just been dealing with it.

368
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,750
而且我应该要升职了
Well, I'm supposed to get this promotion.

369
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,030
- 但不管怎样，这… - 这么做值得吗？
-But either way, it's just... -Is it worth it?

370
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,180
你做什么了？
What'd you do?

371
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,070
- 呃… - 你的手怎么了？
-Uh... -To your hand?

372
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,870
我本来再上班 然后发生了点小意外
Uh, I was at work, and then I had a little accident.

373
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,700
-所以你的工作也好不到哪儿去 - 嗯?
-So your job sucks, too. -Hmm?

374
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,940
你在哪工作？你是做什么的？
Where do you work? What do you do?

375
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,420
- 我在汽车修理店上班 - 别动
-Oh, a mechanic shop. -Don't move.

376
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,090
别感染了
Don't want to get infected.

377
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,610
我的车一直发出噪音。
So my car's been rattling.

378
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,010
- 发出噪音？ - 对
-Rattling? -Yeah.

379
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,170
是你车里面的排气系统夹子松了
Uh, it's just your exhaust system clamp's come loose.

380
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,590
很好修 五分钟就能修好
It's an easy fix. It takes like five minutes.

381
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,010
简直是易如反掌
Super cinchy.

382
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,090
你只需要一个千斤顶和两个螺丝
You just need a lift and two screws.

383
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,930
“易如反掌”？
"Cinchy"?

384
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,840
你不用现在就去修的
You don't have to fix it right now.

385
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,320
我没带我的工具 但是…
Yeah, I don't have my stuff, but...

386
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,600
我明天回去店里
I am at the shop tomorrow.

387
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,790
到时候再给你修
I can fix it then.

388
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,570
为什么自行车不能自己立住呢？
Why can't the bicycle stand on its own?

389
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,280
不 它可以
No, no. It can.

390
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,360
它有脚架
It's got a kickstand.

391
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,640
因为自行车太累了
'Cause it was too tired.

392
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,040
有道理
Yeah.

393
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,950
我已经不需要自行车了
Oh, I'm actually getting rid of the bike,

394
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,080
如果你想要 你就拿走吧
so if you want it, you can have it.

395
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,680
我有一辆摩托车。
I got a motorcycle.

396
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,380
- 摩托车？ - 对
-Oh, a motorcycle? -Yeah.

397
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,050
可以教我怎么骑吗？
Teach me to ride it?

398
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,880
可以啊
Yeah.

399
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,800
你背上脏了
You have shit on your back.

400
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,470
我来弄吧
I'll get it.

401
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,270
我们应该出去玩玩 一起做点什么
We should go out sometime and do something.

402
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,510
- 和我吗？ - 和我们两个
-With me? -With both of us.

403
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,940
我是说 我们都得到那儿
I mean, we'd both have to be there.

404
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,440
否则就不好玩了
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a very good time.

405
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,740
你不会想这样的
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

406
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,080
我晚饭要迟到了
Uh, I'm gonna be late for dinner.

407
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,000
不过 谢谢你帮我包扎伤口
But, uh, I appreciate the hand.

408
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,930
已经感觉好多了
It feels better already.

409
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,120
所以你就是故意的
So you did that on purpose.

410
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,800
什么啊？
 What?

411
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,970
他受伤了
He was injured,

412
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,780
他需要医护处理 而且麦丝医生
he needed medical attention, and Dr. Mathis

413
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,070
- 是咱们这里最棒的医生 - 你信它吗？
-is the best in town. -Do you believe her?

414
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,760
千万别信她说的话
Do not believe a word she says.

415
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,390
-她满脑子都是心机 - 好吧 好吧 好吧
-You know, she's a strategist. -Fine, fine, fine.

416
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,640
她就是想扮演爱神丘比特
She's just trying to play Cupid.

417
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,570
觉得他很帅 人也很好
Thought he was cute. Seemed nice.

418
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,610
你是准备给他打电话
Are you gonna call him

419
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,250
然后邀请他去她的派对
and invite him to her party,

420
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,520
还是准备一个人去？
or you gonna just go alone?

421
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,730
现在选一张牌。嗯哼。
Now pick a card. Mm-hmm.

422
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,490
不是吧 我选到死亡牌了
Oh, no. I got the death card.

423
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,340
别这么想 塔罗牌里面这可不是死亡
No, that's not bad in tarot.

424
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,870
这意味着一个重要阶段结束
that just means a major phase is ending

425
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,570
和新阶段的到来
and a new one is about to begin.

426
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,820
所以就是说 和你约会的那个警察
So, that pretty much puts a nail in the coffin

427
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,280
要成为过去式了
with that police officer you were dating.

428
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,420
哦 道格
Ugh, Doug.

429
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,740
你需要找个新对象才能走出过去
You know, you need to find someone that can let go.

430
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,810
这个人能让你想宽衣解带
That makes you want to rip off your shirt

431
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,080
展示出你光鲜亮丽的酮体 然后说
and show grief your fucking tits and say,

432
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,100
“让我们开干吧”
"You know what? Let's go."

433
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,420
太好吃了
This is delicious.

434
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,650
科里 你的手感染了吗？
Corey. Is it infected?

435
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,260
你的手感染了吗？ 医生怎么说？
Is your hand infected? What did the doctor say?

436
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,720
他说不会有事的 妈妈
He said it's gonna be fine, Mama.

437
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,980
他说你不用担心
He said that you don't need to worry,

438
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,680
他说这只手会恢复得特别好
and he said it would be terrific is what he said.

439
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,510
如果你不能好好监督他的话
Well, I just might have to send him back to the call center

440
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,200
我就把他送到呼叫中心去给德文打工
to work for DeVon if you can't give him proper supervision.

441
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,980
我又不能时时刻刻盯着他
I can't keep my eyes on every second.

442
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,760
你在干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

443
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,540
你在桌子下面偷偷摸摸跟谁打电话呢？
Who's that calling you under the dinner table?

444
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,850
没谁 妈妈。
 it's no one, Mama.

445
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,450
你给谁发消息呢？
Who's that person you're texting?

446
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,520
没谁
It's no one.

447
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,790
藏秘密的孩子是吃不到奶油蛋糕的
Boys who keep secrets don't get custard for dessert.

448
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,720
别告诉她摩托车的事情
Don't tell her about the motorcycle, then.

449
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,240
福特旅行车。
Ford station wagon.

450
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,520
等一下
Hold on one second.

451
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,990
有什么需要帮忙的吗？
Something I can help you with?

452
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,860
科里说我应该把车带来这儿修修
Corey said I should bring it in.

453
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,460
上车
Get on.

454
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,490
好 然后…
Okay, so...

455
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,400
这样
Okay.

456
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,100
右手握的是油门 左手握的是你的前...
Uh, right hand, gas. Left hand is your front...

457
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,750
操了 不好意思

458
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,980
右手握的是油门和你的前刹
Right hand is gas, also your front brake.

459
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,250
左手握的是离合
And then left hand is your, uh, clutch.

460
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,940
右脚踩的是后刹
Right foot is your back brake.

461
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,010
左脚换挡
And, uh, left foot is the shifter thingy.

462
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,500
简单吧
Simple.

463
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,300
听起来不简单。
Doesn't sound simple.

464
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,370
哟 科里
Yo, Corey!

465
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,750

- 嘿 罗纳德 - 嘿 泰瑞
-Hey, Ron. -Hey, Terry.

467
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,330
不好意思拿这破事麻烦你
I'm sorry to bother you with this shit.

468
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,250
我的傻儿子 车胎都他妈瘪了 还开了三英里
My goddamn son drove three miles on a fucking flat

469
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,970
就因为他不知道要怎么
'cause he doesn't know how to change a tire

470
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,020
给该死的汽车换轮胎
on a goddamn automobile.

471
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,990
真他妈是个天才
Fucking genius.

472
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,070
嗯…我来吧。

顺便再他妈给车修整修整
Yeah, and fucking smarten up.

我先去给罗纳德搭把手 等会就来处理你车噪音问题
I'm gonna go help Ronald and then fix the rattle.

475
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,430
你车的噪音 你车上的...
Your rattle. Your car's, uh...

476
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,390
我不关心车的噪音 我是来见你的
I don't care about the rattle. I came to see you.

477

哇哦 看看谁来了

-They're good for you. -Well, I like to

484
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,610
各种肉搅在一起 给加油站的人做可乐饼
mix meats and make croquettes for the guys at the station.

485
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,210
好吧 听起来真恶心
Okay, that just sounds disgusting.

486

497
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,190
但我跟你说，我感觉重获了新生
But I tell you, I-I feel like I won an extra life.

498
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,320

最近一直再摆弄它
and I've been fiddling around with that,

501
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,940
我侄女给我下了一个叫罗塞塔石碑的软件
and my niece gave me a Rosetta Stone,

502
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,400
我正在上面学日语

503
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,250
- 这句是什么意思？ - 意思是我的衬衫丢了
-What does that mean? -It means I lost my shirt.

504
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,030
大概是的 要不就是我的帽子丢了
I think. Or I lost my hat.

505
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,060
我也不确定 我...
I don't know. I...

You still got your nose in that, uh, book you're writing?

511
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,050
这可是你的问题 你给我出的主意
Your fault. It was your idea.

512
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,260
是吗？
It was?

513
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760

就因为你 她再也不能说话了

540
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,710
你诱惑了那个男人 还惹恼了他
You tempted and you provoked that man

541
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,300
你就应该离他远远的
when you should've left him alone.

542
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,930
劳里
Laurie.

543
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,790
嘿
Hey.

544
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,490
你还好吗？
You okay?

545
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,840
嗯
Yeah.

546
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,740
我想去看看樱花
I would like to see those cherry blossoms.

547
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,240
我觉得你也会喜欢的
And I think you'd like 'em, too.

548
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,240
哇唔 谁知道该信什么？
Whoo! Who knows what to believe?

549
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,670
我觉得那个1978年从史密斯森林精神病院逃出来的男人
I think the man who escaped Smith's Grove in 1978

550
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,550
不是杀了那些人的凶手
was not the same man who killed all those people.

551
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,540
真正的迈克尔·迈尔斯那天晚上就被杀了
The real Michael Myers was murdered that night,

552
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,660
那个戴着面具的变态
and the heavy breather with the mask was the same man

553
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,870
就是毒死若望·保禄一世的真凶
who poisoned Pope John Paul I.

554
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,920
*我今天毫无魅力 没人想看到我*
* I'm not attractive today, I'm not a sight for sore eyes *

555
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,950
*我不是亚当也不是夏娃 我只是一个焦虑的年轻人*
* I'm not an Adam or Eve, I'm just a nervous young thing... *

556
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,850
- 你在这啊！- 你好
-There you are! -Hi.

557
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,990
我好想你
I thought I missed you.

558
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,460
面具下面的是谁呀？
Who's under the mask?

559
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,280
我是一个稻草人。
I'm a scarecrow.

560
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,220
什么？
What?

561
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,620
我说我是个稻草人
I said I'm a scarecrow.

562
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,820
你很吓人吗？
Are you supposed to be scary?

563
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,830
我一会儿回来
I'll be right there.

564
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,940
我一会儿回来 好吗？
I'll be right back, okay?

565
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,730
我去拿杯喝的
I'm gonna get us a drink.

566
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,060
*花了点时间 但我最终学会了*
* It took a while, but I learned *

567
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,240
*它经历了一个转折 但我转过身来*
* It took a twist, but I turned *

568
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,980
快看
Watch it!

569
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,040
嘿 稻草人
Hey, scarecrow.

570
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,770
喜欢吗？
See anything you like?

571
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,640
嘿 林赛。
Hey, Lindsay.

572
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,930
- 两杯伏特加苏打酒 - 两杯伏特加苏打酒
-Two vodka sodas. -Two vodka sodas.

573
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,530
琳赛 猜猜艾莉森的稻草人是谁
Lindsay, guess who Allyson's scarecrow is.

574
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,610
就是那个睡了疗养院老太太的男的
The guy that fucked the old lady at the nursing home.

575
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,920
小黛 闭嘴
Deb, drop it.

576
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,820
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

577
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,340
其实是科里·坎宁安
It's actually Corey Cunningham,

578
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,920
杀了小孩的那个男的
the guy that killed that kid.

579
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,660
别听她瞎说 艾莉森
Don't listen to her, Allyson.

580
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,310
你想和谁在一起都可以
You can be with whoever you want to be with.

581
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,070
没错
Yeah.

582
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,500
那么现在
And right now,

583
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,270
我要和他一起
I'm with him.

584
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,130
嘿 哥们 给我来杯啤酒
Hey, man. Can I get a beer?

585
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,690
嘿
Hey.

586
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,610
你刚刚在那儿跳舞跳得很开心吗？
You're just here dancing and having a good time?

587
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,690
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,110
你很抱歉？
You're sorry?

589
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,310
抱歉？ 为杀我儿子抱歉吗？
Sorry? Sorry for killing my son?

590
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,840
我每天早上一睁眼
I wake up every day,

591
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,740
痛苦就向我袭来
and I can't get past the pain.

592
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,910
我难受得不得了 你懂吗？
It kills me. Do you understand?

593
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,620
你觉得你配来这里...
You think you can come here...

594
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,250
不 你根本不懂我的感受 你觉得你能来这里
No, you don't understand if you think you can come here

595
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,980
摘下面具
and take off your little mask

596
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,770
和朋友们大肆玩乐
and have a good time with your friends.

597
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,420
法官可能觉得你是无辜的 但我了解你
A judge might have said you're innocent, but I know you.

598
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,330
我知道这绝不是意外
I know it was no accident.

599
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,130
绝不是意外
It was no accident!

600
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,550
你疯了 所以推了我儿子
You pushed my little boy because you got mad,

601
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,890
你他妈的疯了
and you lost your fucking mind!

602
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,500
无辜的人绝不会那样做 不会
Innocent people don't do that! No!

603
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,840
只有坏人才会
Evil people do.

604
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,010
魔鬼才会
Evil.

605
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,710
科里
Corey!

606
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,790
科里 小心 科里
Corey, watch out! Corey!

607
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,990
科里
Corey!

608
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,450
- 停下 跟我说说话 - 你为什么要带我来酒吧？
-Stop. Talk to me. -Why'd you take me in there?

609
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,390
就是因为这样我才不出门
It's why I don't go out.

610
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,180
- 什么？ 你刚刚…
-What? -You just, you...

611
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,270
把我丢在一大堆人中间 然后...
you threw me in the middle of it, and then you...

612
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,460
你在哪？
Where were you?

613
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,160
我不知道刚刚发生了什么
I didn't know what was happening in there.

614
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,600
我就是想试着 我就是想试着帮你...
I-I was just trying, I was just trying to help you to just...

615
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,530
我他妈不是你的实验品 艾莉森
I'm not your fucking project, Allyson!

616
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,260
我就是...科里 我知道
I just-- Corey, I know!

617
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,840
好吧？我明白那种感觉
Okay? I know what it's like to have

618
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,140
每个人都盯着你 自以为他们了解你
everybody looking at you, thinking that they know you,

619
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,270
明白你经历过什么
thinking that they know what you've been through,

620
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,600
但其实不是
but they don't.

621
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,970
但是那天 我看见你的时候
But when I look at you-- when I saw you the other day,

622
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,730
我只是看见了一个
I just saw a person.

623
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,940
努力想理清这些破事的人
Just a person just trying to figure it the fuck out.

624
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,720
一个想每天起床不再害怕和孤单的人
Trying to wake up every day not scared and alone.

625
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,570
但是 艾莉森 我们俩的不同在于
But the difference, Allyson, between me and you

626
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,400
人们看我好像在想
is that people look at me like,

627
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,690
“这个人是谁？这个怪物是谁？”
"Who is this guy? Who is this monster?"

628
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,770
但他们看到你 会把你当成一个幸存者
And they look at you like-- They see you like a survivor.

629
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,240
你什么意思？
What are you talking about?

630
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,590
我明白了 你从迈克尔·迈尔斯手里逃出来了
I get it. You survived Michael Myers.

631
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,570
你是个勇敢反抗的英雄 但是问问别人
You're a hero with your struggles, and ask anyone.

632
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,480
我是个变态的临时保姆 我是专杀小孩的杀手
I'm the psycho babysitter. I'm the fucking kid killer.

633
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,420
你以为你能拯救我 但你不能
And you think you can fix me, but you can't.

634
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,490
我还是不浪费你的时间了
I'll spare you the heartache.

635
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,290
科里
Corey!

636
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,880
嘿 酷小子 最近怎么样？
Hey, cool kid. What's up?

637
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,510
你要去哪里？
Where you going?

638
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,860
你在这里啊 我一直在找你
There you are, man. I've been looking for you.

639
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,070
- 泰瑞- 我想道歉 好吗?
- Terry. -I want to apologize, okay?

640
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
我的老天
Jesus Christ.

641
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,230
你说呢 科里？
So what do you say, Corey? Huh?

642
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,610
这样吧？握个手 交个朋友
How about this? Handshakes and friendship.

643
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,600
别让他等久了 兄弟
Don't leave him hanging, dude.

644
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,050
你怎么总跟这个孩子过不去？
What is your problem with this kid?

645
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,370
- 这人怪坏了我的雷巴戎 - 就是
-This guy fucked up the LeBaron. -Hell yeah.

646
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,950
一元店买的眼镜？
Dollar store designer frames?

647
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,870
哎呀
Oops.

648
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,620
嘿 让我帮帮你 来吧
Hey, let me help you up. Come on.

649
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,970
- 对不起 - 你还好吗？
-Sorry. -Are you okay?

650
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,710
- 哇 哇 - 都他妈的退后
- Whoa. Whoa. - Get the fuck back!

651
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,660
- 嘿 嘿 - 退后
-Hey! Hey! -Get back!

652
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,990
- 退后 - 哇 哇 哇 
-Get back! -Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

653
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,520
- 我只是想帮忙 - 退后
- I'm just trying to help. - Get back!

654
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,360
你也要杀了我们吗？就像你杀了那小孩那样？
You gonna murder us? Same way you killed that kid?

655
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,530
你这个小婊子
You little psycho bitch.

656
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,040
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about!

657
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,030
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

658
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,710
你从头到脚都是个混蛋
You just act like a goddamn asshole

659
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,630
因为你父亲就是这么对你的
because your father treats you like one.

660
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,940
这会传染的 不是吗？
It's contagious, right?

661
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,250
妈的
Shit.

662
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,550
- 你刚才对我说什么？- 没错
-What did you just say to me? -That's right.

663
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,940
我知道被别人讨厌是什么感受
I know what it looks like when somebody hates you.

664
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,300
你爸就他妈的恨你
And your father fucking hates you.

665
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,430
嗯？他恨我？
Hmm? He hates me?

666
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,990
- 比利 - 他恨我 是吗？
 -He hates me, huh?

667
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,200
-他很我对吗？ - 嘿
-He hates me, right? -Hey!

668
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,410
比利 停下 比利
Billy, knock it off. Billy!

669
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,640
他恨我？
He hates me?

670
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,360
泰瑞 怎么回事？
Terry, what the fuck?!

671
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,920
哦 该死
Oh, shit!

672
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,730
- 妈的 - 我的老天
- Oh, shit. - Oh, my God.

673
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,700
- 该死 - 泰瑞 你干了什么？
-Oh, shit. -Terry, what did you do?!

674
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,770
- 他摔下去了 - 那个混蛋自找的
-He fell. -Little dick busted it.

675
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,490
- 他死了吗？ - 下去看看
- she dead? - Go down and look.

676
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,790
- 不，你下去看看 - 他妈的
-No, you go down and look. -What the fuck?

677
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,830
我没有推人 他自己摔下去的。
I didn't push nobody. He fell.

678
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,110
- 胡说八道 - 他自己摔下去的？
-Bullshit. -He fell?

679
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
是的 就是这样的
Yeah, that's my story.

680
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,420
我们快走吧
Let's get out of here.

681
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,050
到底谁是疯子 泰瑞？ 谁是疯子？ 
Who's the psycho now, Terry? Who's the psycho?

682
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,150
这个小混蛋活该
Little prick deserved it.

683
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,060
玛戈尔 上车
Get in the car, Margo.

684
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,270
我们杀人了 哥们
We killed a kid, man.

685
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,390
快点
Come on.

686
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,860
嘿 出什么事了？
Hey, what's happening?

687
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,220
我他妈打不开这个玩意儿
Just-- I can't get this fucking thing to turn on.

688
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,770
好了 好了 深呼吸
Okay, okay. Take a breath.

689
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,850
-好的 深吸一口气 - 你就让我发疯吧
-Okay, take a deep breath. -Just let me be mad!

690
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,010
我为什么不能发疯？
Why can't I be mad?!

691
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,440
你可以
You can.

692
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,640
你可以发疯
You can be mad.

693
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,400
你可以尽情发疯
You can be very, very mad

694
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,690
你可以摔东西
and you can smash things.

695
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,700
但是要小心 这样做很容易上瘾的
Just be careful. It's addictive.

696
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,950
你说得对
You were right.

697
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,590
我很喜欢他
I liked him.

698
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,210
嗯
Yeah.

699
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,810
你看到里面那个男人了吗？
You see that man in there?

700
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,390
他时不时地把人带进去
He take people in there now and then.

701
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,740
他为什么没有杀你？
Why'd he let you live?

702
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,990
你马上回去
I say you go back.

703
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,040
回去把面具带给我
You go back in there, and you get me that mask.

704
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,790
我是迈克尔·迈尔斯
I'm Michael Myers.

705
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,210
你他妈的干什么？
The fuck?

706
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,950
小混蛋 他跟你没完了
He not done with you, you little fuck.

707
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,660
嘿
Hey!

708
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,960
你去哪儿了？
Where have you been?

709
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,570
我都要担心死了
I have been worried sick!

710
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,090
科里 我差一点就报警了
Corey, I almost called the missing persons.

711
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,430
你到底怎么回事？
What is going on with you?

712
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,660
科里 我和你说话呢
Corey, I'm talking to you.

713
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,360
她可不是什么好人 该死的
She's no good, damn it.

714
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,620
开门
Open the door.

715
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,120
开门
Open the door!

716
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,100
你要让我担心死吗？
Are you trying to kill me?

717
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,440
科里？ 科里？
Corey? Corey?

718
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,420
不要因为升职的事情难过 好吗？
No hard feelings about the promotion, right?

719
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,650
当然不会 这是你应得的
Course not. You deserve it.

720
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,520
我觉得麦丝医生
I thought for sure Dr. Mathis

721
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,270
肯定会让你当护士长的
was gonna make you the charge nurse.

722
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,760
小黛 我能和你说两句话吗？
Deb, can I speak to you a minute?

723
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,920
小黛 我只说一遍…
Deb, I'm gonna tell you once...

724
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:15,880
人们叙写自己的故事
People create their own stories

725
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,410
做出他们自己的选择
and make their own choices.

726
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,460
他们只相信他们愿意相信的事情
They believe what they want to believe.

727
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,780
我希望通过我的方式
I'm hopeful, with perspective,

728
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,580
用我的经历慰藉他人
that my experience will help others heal.

729
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,760
你得扪心自问 “我能否自控”
You have to ask yourself, "Am I in control,

730
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,090
“还是被环境所控制？”
"or do the elements control me?"

731
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,090
“生还是死“
"Life or death."

732
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,480
”自杀还是像樱花一样盛开“
"Suicide or cherry blossoms."

733
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,350
你好
Hi.

734
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,940
抱歉 我不是故意要吓你的
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

735
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,130
我在等艾莉森
I'm just waiting for Allyson.

736
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,920
科里？
Corey?

737
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,980
没事吧？
Everything okay?

738
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,870
我昨晚在回家的时候被偷袭了
I got jumped on the way home last night.

739
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,160
那些人…
These guys...

740
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,190
那些加油站的孩子在找我茬
Those kids from the gas station that were messing with me

741
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,090
我努力反抗 但是他们…
I tried to stand up for myself, and they, um...

742
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,280
我很抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

743
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,750
我来找你 因为我想和你谈谈
I just came 'cause I wanted to talk to you.

744
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,040
我想说我很抱歉，还有…
I wanted to say that I'm sorry and there's...

745
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:56,780
我不想找借口
no excuse.

746
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,590
但是拜托 拜托你
But if you could, please, if you could just

747
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,980
和我谈谈
take a walk with me.

748
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,420
好吗？
Please?

749
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,570
我杀人了
I killed someone.

750
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,580
我们当时在做纸飞机
We were making paper planes,

751
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,830
可他想看怪兽电影
but he wanted to watch a monster movie.

752
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,630
然后都是一瞬间的事
Everything happened so fast.

753
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,390
我那晚只是希望我们能好好玩
I just wanted it to be a fun night.

754
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,930
享受美好时光…仅此而已
That's all, just... a good night.

755
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,580
但是后来全都失控了
And then it all went bad.

756
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:47,610
我听说过是怎么回事
I heard what happened.

757
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,240
我知道这听起来很不可思议 但是当…
I know it sounds crazy, but when...

758
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,950
可是人们谈起这件事的时候 我感觉我好像认识你
people would talk about it, it was like I knew you.

759
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,870
好像我一直在寻找你
Like I was looking for you.

760
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:00,690
然后她带你来到了我身边
And then she brought you to me.

761
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,010
他做错了什么吗？
Has he done something bad?

762
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,110
我不明白你为什么来这里
I don't understand why you're here.

763
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,550
不是 他在和我孙女约会
No, no. He's seeing my granddaughter.

764
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,510
其实是我介绍他们认识的
I introduced them, actually.

765
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,160
你孙女和科里这样的男孩子在一起
Your granddaughter should be so lucky

766
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,730
真是太幸运了
as to be with a boy like Corey.

767
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,200
他很帅 也很善解人意
He's handsome. He's sensitive.

768
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,320
我不太喜欢他和女孩在外面过夜
I don't like it when he stays out

769
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,410
但是他已经长大了
all night with girls, but he's grown.

770
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,060
他可以做自己想做的事了
He can do what he wants.

771
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:32,550
是的
Yes.

772
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,860
我知道他有自己的难处
I know he's had his difficulties.

773
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,790
我儿子
My son.

774
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:44,300
在杰里米·艾伦出事之后 整个镇子都针对他
This town turned against him after the accident with Jeremy Allen.

775
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:45,920
他们本应该同情他
They would've felt for him.

776
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,310
帮助他走出阴影
They would've helped him heal.

777
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,920
可你的恶魔人消失了
But because your boogeyman disappeared,

778
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,710
所以他们需要一个新的怪物
they needed a new one.

779
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,640
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

780
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,390
我父母被杀以后
After my mom and dad were killed,

781
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,710
我想把一切都一把火烧了
I just wanted to burn it all to the ground

782
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,680
- 离开哈顿菲尔德 - 为什么不离开呢？
-and get away from Haddonfield. -Why not leave?

783
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,110
为什么要留下来？
Why stay?

784
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,760
这个地方有我所有的记忆
All my memories are here.

785
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,680
我觉得你父母都被杀后
I think both your parents got killed

786
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,150
你外婆因此感到内疚
and your grandma feels guilty about it,

787
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,630
所以她把你当成了她的孩子
so she's making you her child.

788
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,900
你应该看看她治疗前是什么样子
If you could've seen her before therapy,

789
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,440
她现在已经好很多了 而我…
sobering up, and me...

790
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,730
我只是不敢想象 如果我走后
I'm just terrified to think what would happen

791
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,440
只剩她孤身一人 会发生什么事
if she were all alone if I left.

792
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,980
所以 你是说 你得一直留在这
So, what, you got to stay here, protect her

793
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,360
保护她？
from herself forever?

794
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,220
听着…
Look...

795
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,010
对不起 我在聚会上昏头了
I'm sorry I lost my head at the party

796
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,140
我一走了之
and I walked away.

797
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,100
那是我的错
That was a mistake.

798
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,660
当时我看着你时 我…
When I look at you, I...

799
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,650
我知道我可以告诉你真相
I know I can tell you the truth.

800
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,320
我不怕这些人了
I'm not afraid of these people.

801
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,490
再也不怕了
I'm not afraid anymore.

802
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,660
告诉我 你想要把房子付之一炬
You tell me that you want to burn it down,

803
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,210
还是想把它烧个干净
or you tell me you want to burn it to the ground.

804
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,130
嘿 一周里碰到两次
Hey. Twice in one week.

805
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,180
太酷了 难以置信
Pretty cool. Hot diggity.

806
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,720
嘿 你之前说你...会打给我
Hey, you said you, uh... you were gonna call.

807
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,390
你说…你会打给我 但你没有打
You were... you were gonna call, but you didn't call.

808
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:09,390
对 我还没有打给你
No, I owe you a call.

809
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,500
我……我做错什么了 还是...
Did I... did I do something wrong or...

810
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:12,900
我有约了
I'm with someone.

811
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,750
哦 哦
Oh. Oh.

812
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,390
哦 真对不起
Oops. Uh, sorry for that.

813
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,780
很抱歉打扰你们
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

814
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,730
好吧 呃 今天...是乔·格里洛的...
Well, um, you know, it's, uh... it's Joe Grillo's, uh...

815
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,980
嘿 乔 嘿
Hey, Joe! Hey.

816
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,900
今天是乔·格里洛的生日
Joe Grillo's birthday today.

817
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,290
乔·罗斯做了个海绵蛋糕
And Joe Ross, uh, he made a sponge cake.

818
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,720
你们俩结束后
You two want to stop by, get a slice

819
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,300
-可以来尝尝 - 我们不用了
-after whatever you guys are doing? -We're good.

820
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,250
好吧 你们不想吃
Oh. Okay, you're good.

821
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,140
听我说 就是…
Let me tell you, it's, uh...

822
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,150
如果你改变主意了，还有…
If you change your mind, there's...

823
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,530
她说了我们不用了
She said we're good!

824
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,160
嘿 哥们 你有意见？
Hey, buddy, you got a problem?

825
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,170
我没有
We're good.

826
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,220
哦 该死
Oh, shit.

827
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,220
埃里森
Allyson.

828
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,530
所以你晚上睡不着
So you call Mr. Aggravated Manslaughter

829
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,060
就打给了暴虐杀人狂先生？
at night when you can't sleep?

830
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,320
当你在噩梦看见了恶魔人后
When you see the Boogeyman in your nightmares?

831
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,720
你还觉得跟这个家伙在一起更有安全感？
You feel safe with this guy?

832
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,200
嘿 哥们
Hey, man.

833
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,660
随便说说罢了
Messing around.

834
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,500
埃里森
Allyson.

835
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,190
不 不 不
Nah, nah, nah.

836
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,950
-神经病 - 你没事吧 慕兰尼？
-Psycho. -You good, Mulaney?

837
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,420
没事 我很好
It's all good. It's all good.

838
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,430
需要我们教训某人吗？
We need to go kick somebody's ass?

839
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,710
不 不用 我搞得定
No, no. I got this.

840
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,300
我只是想烧个干净
Just burn it all to the ground.

841
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,100
我来帮你点火
I'll light the match.

842
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,740
想进来坐坐吗？
Do you want to come in?

843
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,590
改天吧
Another night.

844
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,410
啊 操
Ah, fuck!

845
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,900
嘿
Hey!

846
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,530
别惹道格·慕兰尼
You don't fuck with Doug Mulaney!

847
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,040
你在哪？嗯？
Where are you? Huh?

848
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,470
你还说这是个事故
You say it was an accident.

849
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,570
但我知道你做了什么
But I know what you did.

850
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,780
我要打爆你的脸 你这混蛋
I'm gonna fuck your face up, you little shit.

851
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:33,870
那他妈的是什么？
The fuck is that?

852
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:03,570
来啊
Help.

853
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,740
给我看看你的能耐
Show me how to do it.

854
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,650
起来 起来 起来呀
Get up, get up, get up.

855
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:10,980
快起来
Get up!

856
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,080
是谁呀？
Who is it?

857
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,410
是我。
It's me.

858
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:42,850
天呐 你没事吧？
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

859
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,420
我不知道我怎么了
I don't know what's happening to me.

860
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,130
发生了什么事？
What's going on?

861
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:56,880
看着我
Look at me.

862
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,310
谁伤的你？
Who did this to you?

863
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,110
嘿
Hey.

864
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:08,530
看着我
Look at me.

865
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,730
迈克尔·迈尔斯没杀你？
Did Michael Myers let you live?

866
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,730
还是你逃出来了？
Or did you escape?

867
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,960
疼吗？
Does it hurt?

868
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,710
不 不疼
No. No.

869
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,410
我妈妈救了我
My mother saved me.

870
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,340
你俩睡了 对吗？
You're fucking him, aren't you?

871
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:28,160
这种程度上算是哈登菲尔德的完美故事了
It's, like, the perfect story of Haddonfield in a way.

872
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,500
年轻貌美的女孩爱上了本地的怪胎
Cute young girl falls for local creep.

873
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,310
想象一下 如果你外婆
Imagine if your grandmother had

874
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,740
爱上了迈克尔·迈尔斯
fallen in love with Michael Myers.

875
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,640
但她没有 我听说她用该死的毛衣棒针
But she didn't. I heard she stabbed him

876
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:36,700
捅进了他的脖子
in the neck with a fucking knitting needle.

877
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,840
你有什么毛病 小黛？
What's your problem, Deb?

878
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,400
你当我不存在似的 对着我说一大通
You talk to me like I'm not even here.

879
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:41,060
你那张臭嘴一直这么唠叨吗？
Do you ever just shut your goddamn mouth?

880
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:44,510
我知道 好吗？
I know, right?

881
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:45,730
我知道我话多
I know I talk too much.

882
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,780
我只是对于恶魔人这档子事很感兴趣
I just get so excited about all that Boogeyman bullshit.

883
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,090
不 我可不认那笔交易
No. I-I'm vetoing that trade.

884
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,650
你的第二接球手在面对马克的最终防守时
Your second receiver for Mark's last-place defense

885
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:56,750
明显是串通好的
reeks of collusion.

886
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,790
这不是平等的交易
It's not a straight-up swap.

887
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,960
你想带你们团队夺冠吗？
You want to win the championship with class?

888
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,160
别耍小把戏
Stop cheating.

889
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,510
别耍小把戏
Stop cheating.

890
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,220
我一直看着他的眼睛
I keep seeing his eyes.

891
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,080
我们在说迈克尔还是这孩子？
Are we talking about Michael or this kid?

892
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,690
科里有着迈克尔的眼神
Michael's eyes in Corey.

893
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:16,360
我很确定 琳赛
Lindsay, I was so sure.

894
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,600
就跟一开始第一次一样
Just like the first time.

895
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,760
嗨 罗杰
Hey, Roger.

896
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:25,730
有个人我想让你见见
There's someone I want you to meet.

897
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,620
我一直挺喜欢科里的
I always liked Corey.

898
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,690
有些小孩你一看就知道他们事混球
You know, some kids, you can tell they're a pain in the ass,

899
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,240
但科里是个好孩子
but Corey was a good kid.

900
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,340
我不相信他会做出
And I just couldn't imagine he'd be capable

901
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,050
故意伤人的事
of hurting anyone on purpose.

902
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:38,980
但经过庭审以后 我...
But with the trial, I...

903
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,430
我脑海里就萦绕着一些念头
just started spinning with theories, and...

904
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,000
最后我想 
and eventually I thought,

905
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,610
“放弃它 你永远都不可能解脱
"Give it up. You're never gonna get closure.

906
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,890
没有解脱可言”
There's no such thing."

907
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,630
几年过去了 我时不时遇到他
A couple of years go by, and I'd see him every now and then,

908
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,310
看到大家都躲着他
see the way people avoided him

909
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,600
在他背后做鬼脸
or how they made faces behind his back,

910
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,220
说实话 我很生气
which, if I'm honest, pissed me off.

911
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,580
因为我觉得他们夺走了我的痛苦…
Because I felt like they took my pain...

912
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,950
...我的绝望
...my despair,

913
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,090
把我失去的偷走 变成他们的故事
and they made it about them.

914
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,100
昨天，我在上班的路上
And then, yesterday, I'm on my way to work.

915
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:10,990
看到他在路上走
There he is.

916
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,670
我想"我得说点什么
And I think, "I'm gonna say something,

917
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:16,400
证明我老婆是错的
"prove my wife wrong.

918
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,470
想个办法原谅这孩子吧”
Let's find a way to forgive this kid."

919
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,720
于是我在他边上停下车 他看向我
And I pull up next to him, and he looks at me,

920
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,340
但这不是他本人
and it's not him.

921
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,190
至少眼神不像
At least not in the eyes.

922
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:33,570
我不知道怎么回事
And I don't know, man.

923
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,030
他看得我毛骨悚然
The hairs on the back of my neck stood up.

924
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,430
当时我明白了
Right then, I felt like I got my answer.

925
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:47,010
杀我儿子的凶手 不是当年那个给我家除草的孩子
The kid who used to mow our lawn didn't kill my son.

926
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,880
我清楚这一点
I know that.

927
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,600
我在路边看到的那个人
But the guy I saw on the side of the road

928
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,110
他已弃明投暗
was down a dark path.

929
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,600
是那场意外之后 镇上的人让他变成这样的
Did the town do this to him after the accident?

930
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,020
还是他的黑暗面一直都在呢？
Or was it always there?

931
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,270
你再给我的笑话捧场呢
You're just laughing at all my jokes,

932
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,490
是吧？
aren't you?

933
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,840
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

934
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,500
好吧 阿利克 
All right, Alexa.

935
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,460
播放罗伯·加尔布雷思的【用你的眼睛告诉我】。
Play "Tell Me With Your Eyes" by Rob Galbraith.

936
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,380
开始播放【用你的眼睛告诉我……】
Here's "Tell Me With Your Eyes..."

937
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,960
你家房子…
This house is so...

938
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:22,960
可真富丽堂皇
rich.

939
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:31,370
宝贝 我等了一整天了
Baby, I have been waiting all day for this.

940
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,760
我一直保存着这瓶奥邦没喝
I've been saving this bottle of Au Bon Climat.

941
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,490
你今天上班的时候实在太性感了
You looked so fucking hot at the office today.

942
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,270
介意我去……
Mind if I...

943
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,470
卧室在走廊尽头
Bedroom's down the hall.

944
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,280
去洗个澡
Clean up. Take a shower.

945
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,850
我们卧室见
In fact, I'll meet you in there.

946
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,070
真好 真好
Yes, yes.

947
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,310
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

948
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,910
真棒
Yes.

949
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,050
我的天
Holy shit.

950
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,180
这里有医生吗？
Is there a doctor in the house?

951
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,460
好了 宝贝儿
Yeah, baby. All right.

952
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:36,910
奶酪有了 饼干有了
Got the cheese. We got the crackers.

953
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,640
准备好了
We're ready.

954
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,860
麦丝医生？
Dr. Mathis?

955
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:50,910
麦丝医生？
Dr. Mathis?

956
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,250
麦丝医生？
Dr. Mathis?

957
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,310
麦丝医生？
Dr. Mathis?

958
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,060
救命 救命 救命 救命
Please, please, please, please.

959
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,950
在那次意外事故以后
After the accident,

960
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:51,730
我有时候骑自行车过来 坐在楼顶上
I'd ride my bike over here and I'd sit up on this roof.

961
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,880
抬头看着那座塔
And I'd look up at that tower.

962
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,920
想着我能不能爬到塔顶
Wonder if I could climb to the top.

963
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,450
它召唤着我
It was summoning me.

964
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,530
像灯塔一样召唤我回到以前的生活
Like a watchtower or beacon calling me to live my old life.

965
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,280
继续快乐地生活
To be happy again.

966
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,610
我也有那种感觉
I have something like that, too.

967
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,230
它总会给我希望 你知道，事情会
It always gave me hope, you know, things would--

968
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:19,940
或许一切都能回到
well, maybe somehow things would go back

969
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,660
最初的样子
to the way they used to be.

970
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,750
回到生活翻天覆地之前
Before everything changed.

971
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,090
变得一塌糊涂之前
Infected.

972
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,840
我应该离开所有认识我的人
I got to get away from everybody who knows me.

973
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,660
但是我 我…
But I don't, I...

974
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,970
不想一个人离开
I don't want to go alone.

975
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,980
科里 好了
Corey, come on.

976
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,030
别笑
Stop.

977
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,520
你怕绷带不够
I think you're scared that you don't have enough bandages

978
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,660
不能把我绑住
to keep me together.

979
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:58,440
科里 你在干什么...？
Corey, what are you...?!

980
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,820
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

981
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,430
你疯了吗？
What, are you insane?

982
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,550
怎么，你想自杀吗？
What, are you trying to kill yourself?

983
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,570
我对永生可没有兴趣
I'm not interested in immortality.

984
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,830
谁在外面搞鬼？
The hell is going on out here?

985
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,270
喂 这是私人领地
Yo, this is private property.

986
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,470
不管你做什么都不安全…
Not safe to be doing whatever the hell you do...

987
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,230
科里·坎宁安
Corey Cunningham.

988
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,060
你在搞什么？ 你个丑瘪三
What you doing out here, you ugly motherfucker?

989
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,480
- 科里 别管他 - 你会吓到孩子们的
-ALLYSON: Corey, stop it. -You gonna scare all the kids.

990
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,240
你别说了
You stop.

991
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:36,980
我不知道你他妈的跟谁讲话
I don't know who the fuck you talking to,

992
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,570
但我可知道你是谁
but, uh, I know who you are.

993
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,020
没错 我知道劳里·斯特罗德那些事
Yeah, I know the Laurie Strode story.

994
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,790
捉弄一个脑子不正常的人 结果那人成了杀人狂
She teased a man with brain damage, and then he snapped.

995
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:48,710
你看看你
Look at you.

996
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,260
你也想搞出点名声是吗？
You gonna make a little name for yourself now, huh?

997
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,530
和这个蠢婊子在一起。
Walking around with this dumb bitch right here.

998
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,560
你没有闭嘴的时候
You never shut up.

999
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,220
到处都能听到你的声音
Hear his voice everywhere.

1000
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,490
你说得太他妈对了
Oh, you're goddamn right you do.

1001
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,570
听威力说话就像听最喜欢的歌
And once Willie get in your ear,

1002
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,850
在你脑海里挥之不去。
it's like your favorite song stuck in your head.

1003
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,720
给我快滚
Y'all get the hell up off my property

1004
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,050
不然我收拾你们
before I fuck y'all up.

1005
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,150
好
All right.

1006
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:15,850
你说得对
You're right.

1007
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,510
我们走吧
Let's do it.

1008
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,530
我不想待在哈顿菲尔德了
I don't want to be in Haddonfield anymore.

1009
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,840
我就要和你在一起
I want to be with you.

1010
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,000
你身上有那女人的气味
I can smell her on you.

1011
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:46,370
她想把你从我身边抢走 是吧？
She's trying to take you away from me, isn't she?

1012
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,020
原来你每晚都是去找她
That's where you go every night.

1013
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,770
好吧 你走
Well, I say go.

1014
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,760
现在就走
You go right now!

1015
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,720
从我家滚出去
Get out of my house!

1016
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,100
哦 不 不
Oh, no. No.

1017
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,520
希望你幸福
I hope you find love.

1018
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:35,770
埃里森
Allyson?

1019
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:45,550
很高兴见到你
It's nice to see you.

1020
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,520
恶魔有两种
You know, there are two kinds of evil.

1021
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,140
一种是外界的恶魔
There's the evil that exists as an external force

1022
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,270
威胁人们的安全
that threatens the well-being of the tribe.

1023
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:11,550
为了生存 人们要对自己可能受到的伤害
Survival depends on understanding and awareness

1024
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:15,530
有所理解 察觉和畏惧
and fear of physical threat to our daily lives.

1025
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:18,280
另一种恶魔就在我们之中
The other kind of evil lives inside us.

1026
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,830
就像疾病或感染
Like a sickness or an infection.

1027
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,540
这总恶魔更危险 因为人们可能不知道它的存在
It's more dangerous because we may not know we're infected.

1028
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:37,920
我是坏人吗？
Am I a bad person?

1029
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,320
你说吗？
Are you?

1030
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:42,980
呃…
Well...

1031
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:46,990
...我们都是满不在乎的
...we're both fucked-up.

1032
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,360
我想帮你 科里
I want to help you, Corey.

1033
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,060
让我来帮你
Let me help you.

1034
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,450
或者让我找人帮你
Or let me find help for you.

1035
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,330
你不能和艾莉森在一起
You can't have her.

1036
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:59,890
她不合适你
Allyson is not equipped for this relationship,

1037
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,210
我不会让她受伤的
and I will not let her get hurt.

1038
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:04,230
所以你给我离远点…
So stay the fuck away...

1039
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,730
这都是你造成的
You started this!

1040
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,600
是你当初接纳我
You brought me in! You invited me!

1041
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:12,990
你才是罪魁祸首
But you're the one to blame.

1042
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,870
“你想动手 还是想让我来？”
"You want to do it, or you want me to?"

1043
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,270
如果我不能得到艾莉森…
If I can't have her...

1044
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,590
其他人也别想
...no one will.

1045
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:35,000
你想帮艾莉森是吗？ 让她自己做主
You want to help Allyson? Let her live her life.

1046
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:39,980
她现在和我在一起了
She has me now.

1047
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,140
你放弃吧
You should give in.

1048
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,910
你第一次直视他的双眼时
You should surrender to that feeling you had

1049
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:56,080
就不该在内心挣扎
the first time you ever looked into his eyes.

1050
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,350
其实你期盼迈克尔回来找你
You secretly hope Michael comes back for you.

1051
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:10,520
我是精神病
I'm the psycho.

1052
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,770
你是怪人
You're the freak show.

1053
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:52,750
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1054
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:54,170
我们得走了
We need to leave.

1055
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,750
现在不行 我的上班
I can't right now. I'm working.

1056
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,770
那就晚上
Tonight, then.

1057
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:01,900
晚上九点见面好吗？
Will you meet me at 9:00?

1058
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:04,900
在七十四号公路的餐厅
At the diner off 74.

1059
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,470
我们得谈谈你外婆
We need to talk about your grandmother.

1060
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,870
她想杀了我
She wants to kill me.

1061
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,250
- 什么？- 你没听错
- What?  - Yeah.

1062
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,050
我受不了了
I can't take it anymore.

1063
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,920
是时候离开哈顿菲尔德了
It's time to say goodbye to Haddonfield.

1064
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:26,890
我需要你的一样东西
You got something I need.

1065
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,880
你只不过戴着一个万圣节面具
You're just a man in a Halloween mask.

1066
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,940
我看你还有什么本事
What are you gonna do now?

1067
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:20,840
完事给他打电话
Call him after.

1068
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,330
我不想去你家 伙计
I don't want to go to your house, man.

1069
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,780
你爸爸总他妈吼我们
Your dad always fucking yells at us.

1070
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,030
真他妈遗憾 你家买不起房
Too fucking bad. You should've got your own.

1071
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:26,300
你不应该吃这个
Shouldn't have any of these anyway.

1072
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:27,790
为什么我们不能去她家？ 她家才有钱
Why can't we go to her house? She's the one that's rich.

1073
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:29,630
- 什么？ 哦对 - 这他妈谁干的？
-Oh, what? Yeah. Shoot. - What the fuck?

1074
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,030
怎么了？
What?

1075
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,480
他死定了 上车
He's dead! Get in!

1076
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:37,750
操 操
Oh, shit. Shit.

1077
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,010
找到你要找的额东西了吗？
Did you find what you're looking for?

1078
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:56,530
我猜你打算开启一段美好的旅程
I imagine you're going on a wonderful trip.

1079
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,500
- 你打算瞒着我吗？ - 有什么区别吗？
-Were you gonna tell me? -What difference does it make?

1080
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:02,360
区别很大 艾莉森
It makes a big difference, Allyson.

1081
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:05,420
我觉得他不对劲 会伤害到你
I feel he is capable of real harm.

1082
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,690
你就担心这个？
Is that what bothers you?

1083
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:11,330
你是怀疑还是妄想？
Is it suspicion or paranoia?

1084
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,370
直觉？ 还是有什么头绪？
Intuition? An inkling?

1085
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:14,470
你有头绪吗？
You got an inkling?

1086
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:17,050
我去了他家 见到了他母亲
I went to his home. I met his mother.

1087
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:19,120
我知道 他告诉我了
I know. He told me.

1088
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,970
所以 你开始跟踪他了？
So, you're what? You're stalking him now?

1089
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:23,550
- 没有 - 而且你在威胁他
-No. -And you're threatening him.

1090
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,890
- 你对他说了什么？ - 我在他眼里看到另一个人
-What did you say to him? -I-I see the same thing in him

1091
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:28,190
- 看到了迈克尔 - 迈克尔。
- that I saw in Michael. - Michael.

1092
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,210
你才是迈克尔·迈尔斯
Michael Myers is who you are.

1093
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:31,850
你没明白我的意思 艾莉森
You're not listening to me, Allyson.

1094
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,150
我是想保护你
I am trying to protect you.

1095
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,760
我不想要你保护
I don't want your protection!

1096
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,550
但你...你可以生活的很幸福 艾莉森
But you-you can have a good life, Allyson.

1097
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,230
快乐的生活
A good life.

1098
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:41,540
但不要和他在一起
Just not with him.

1099
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,460
你假装走出阴影了 但根本就没有
You pretend like you moved on, but it's bullshit.

1100
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:46,920
其实你是对死亡着迷
You're actually just obsessed with death,

1101
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,130
你把这一切视为游戏
like it's some sort of game.

1102
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,100
不玩完你不会罢休
And you're not gonna rest until you've finished it

1103
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:52,810
或者等所有人都像你一样悲惨 你才会收手
or until everybody else is as fucking miserable as you are!

1104
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:55,460
科里是唯一让我有感觉的人
I need to get out of here before this town kills

1105
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,820
在他被这个小镇逼死之前 我一定要离开
the one person that actually makes me feel something.

1106
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,580
他已经误入歧途了
He is on a dark path!

1107
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,960
我不想让你陷入其中
I'm not gonna let this happen to you!

1108
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:05,290
你必须要相信我
You have to believe me!

1109
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,030
相信你？
Believe you?

1110
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:09,710
你想让我相信你？
You want me to believe you?

1111
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:13,490
这些混乱都是你引起的
Because of the hysteria that you caused

1112
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:16,500
就是因为信你 我朋友都死了
when I trusted you, my friends are dead.

1113
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,300
我父母也死了
My parents are dead.

1114
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,800
你才是一切的罪魁祸首
You're the one that's capable of fucking harm!

1115
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,760
你确定他现在在这儿吗？
You sure he turned in here, dude?

1116
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:38,450
是的 他就躲在这儿的
 Yeah, it's like his hideout or something.

1117
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,900
在这儿工作
It's where he works.

1118
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,120
- 工作个鬼哦 - 确实 工作了个鬼
-His work is a dump. -It actually is a dump.

1119
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,720
好了将真的 他在哪啊？
Okay, no, but seriously, where is he?

1120
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,040
- 看 车还停在那的 - 操 快停车
- There's the bike. - Shit, dude, pull over.

1121
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,830
太疯狂了
This is gonna be so crazy.

1122
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,830
- 走走走 - 比利 你能快点吗？
- Let's go. -  Billy, can you hurry up?

1123
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,420
- 科里 - 别挤我
- Corey! - You're squishing me.

1124
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,420
- 老天爷 - 那他去了？
- God.  - Where'd he go?

1125
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:55,640

Come out, Corey!

1126
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:59,320

Corey, I just want to kiss and make up, my man!

1127
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:01,260
- 出来吧 - 别那么讨人厌
-Come on! -Stop being a punk!

1128
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,260
- 科里 - 你在哪儿？
- Corey! - Where you at, man?

1129
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,100
你待会就会知道划我老爹的车会怎么样
I'll show you what happens when you mess with my dad's car!

1130
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,280
你可以快点吗 兄弟？
Can we hurry this up, man?

1131
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,200

Oh, I got an idea.

1132
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,340
比利 你会车上
Billy, back the car up.

1133
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,500

01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,060
你真的以为我会自杀？
Did you really think I'd kill myself?

1233
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,390
我那么努力…
I have tried so hard...

1234
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:48,220
想获得同情心和怜悯
...to have compassion and find mercy.

1235
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,990
但又有什么意义呢？
But what's the point?

1236
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:06,620
你是来杀我的 那就动手吧
You came here to kill me, so do it.

1237
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:33,350
我们都最终会
You know, we all learn the truth

1238
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:34,910
看清对方是什么样的人
about each other eventually.

1239
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,270
你真的觉得
Did you really think

1240
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:44,750
艾莉森会和你在一起吗？
that Allyson was gonna be with you?

1241
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,920
如果我不能拥有她…
If I can't have her...

1242
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,050
你个狗娘养的。
You son of a bitch.

1243
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,590
你做了什么？
What did you do?

1244
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:15,740
你对他做了什么？
What did you do to him?

1245
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:18,210
不 不 
No, no.

1246
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:24,620
不 不啊
No. No.

1247
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,760
你为什么要这么做？
Why did you do this?

1248
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:30,900
-不 - 科里 别死 回来
-No. -Corey, come back. Come back.

1249
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,350
不 不
 No, no.

1250
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,480
是你
You!

1251
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,860
艾莉森 劳里去哪儿了？
Allyson, where's Laurie?

1252
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,560
我们正在处理一通电话 报告了一起自杀案件
We're responding to a call. She called in a suicide.

1253
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,190
不
No!

1254
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,740
我逃离过你
I've run from you.

1255
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:07,980
也寻找过你
I have chased you.

1256
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:13,090
我曾试着控制你
I have tried to contain you.

1257
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,210
也试着原谅你
I have tried to forgive you.

1258
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:27,010
我本以为你是恶魔人
I thought maybe you were the Boogeyman.

1259
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:28,690
但
No.

1260
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:34,220
你只是一个将死之人罢了
You're just a man who's about to stop breathing.

1261
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:58,760
来吧
Do it.

1262
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,350
来啊
Do it!

1263
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:14,530
动手吧
Do it.

1264
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:17,700
不
No!

1265
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:26,170
我不会让你经历这样的事的
I'm not gonna let this happen to you.

1266
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:50,790
没关系。
It's okay.

1267
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,490
别挡路 就呆在这儿
Get out of the way. Stay here.

1268
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:11,910
别往前
Just stay back.

1269
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:16,450
劳里
Laurie!

1270
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:48,190
迈克尔
Michael.

1271
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:50,670
他死了
He's dead.

1272
01:39:54,690 --> 01:39:55,840
还没死透呢
Not dead enough.

1273
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,630
我们不该这样
This isn't how we do it.

1274
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:01,850
- 你真是疯了 - 你在干什么？
- You're all crazy. -  What are you doing?

1275
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,430
你要带他去哪儿？
Where are you taking him?

1276
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:05,780
哈顿菲尔德是时候从伤痛中走出来了
Time for Haddonfield to start healing.

1277
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:07,250
让大家都看看吧
Let's show them all.

1278
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:13,340
事情不该这样
This is not how it works.

1279
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:15,860
就是今晚
It is tonight.

1280
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,940
呃，加强无线电静默。
Uh, stronger on radio silence.

1281
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,430
这是新的指令
That's got to be a command.

1282
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:21,130
- 收到 - 收到
-Copy that. - Copy.

1283
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:22,280
走吧
Let's go.

1284
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,010
迈克尔·迈尔斯的尸体
The body of Michael Myers

1285
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:55,380
已在一次午夜游行中被处置
was disposed of in a midnight procession.

1286
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,720
没有任何的墓碑和纪念碑
There would be no tombstone, no memorial.

1287
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:01,020
所有的谜已经解开
The mysteries were put to bed,

1288
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:04,390
我们讲述的故事也将消逝在时间之中
and the story as we told it was to fade with time.

1289
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,220
你对科里的怀疑是对的
You were right about Corey.

1290
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,760
我知道是他杀了那些人
I know he killed those people.

1291
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,750
他被邪恶吞噬了
He was consumed by evil.

1292
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:29,540
哈顿菲尔德的事件
The events of Haddonfield

1293
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:32,550
曾带来了如此多的暴力和鲜血
that created so much violence and bloodshed

1294
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:34,960
现在终于结束了
finally had resolve.

1295
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,890
报告中确当 迈克尔·迈尔斯
 Reports now confirm that Michael Myers

1296
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,280
是在一起袭击未遂的事件中被反杀的
has indeed been killed dead after an attempted assault

1297
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:49,990
被袭击对象是哈登菲尔德居民劳里·斯特罗德
of Haddonfield resident Laurie Strode.

1298
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,890
一个奇迹般的生存故事
What an incredible story of survival

1299
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:56,210
在我们的社区经历了几十年的动荡后
through decades of disturbances in our local community.

1300
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,020
终于…
Finally...

1301
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,260
新的开始就在眼前
New beginnings lay ahead.

1302
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,620
我们都禁受了恐惧
Fear moves through all of us,

1303
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:11,230
但我们可以自己决定 何时投降
and we decide when to surrender.

1304
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:15,360
我已经与自己的恶魔人告别
I've said goodbye to my boogeyman,

1305
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,680
但邪恶永远不会消亡
but the truth is evil doesn't die.

1306
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:21,540
只是以另一种形式出现
It changes shape.

1307
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:42,910
我希望你知道 我一直想着你
I wanted you to know I was thinking about you.

1308
01:44:44,110 --> 01:44:45,840
我想感谢你的壮举
I want to thank you for what you did.

1309
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:50,060
送给你的
Enjoy.

1310
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:05,510
再给我讲讲你之前说的樱花的故事吧
What was it you were saying about those cherry blossoms?
