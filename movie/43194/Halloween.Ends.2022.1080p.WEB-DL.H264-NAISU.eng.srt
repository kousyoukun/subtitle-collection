MRS. ALLEN:
Roger! Corey's here!

36
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,909
Sorry this is last-minute,
but Andrea got a stomach bug

37
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,120
-and literally just called me.
-Oh, it's okay.

38
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,788
It's Roger's company
Halloween party,

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,457
and I could care less, but...
Roger!

40
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,918
Hope he's better at childcare
than he is at yard work.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,128
You know, next spring,

42
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,212
you should consider
some perennials.

43
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,839
Hydrangeas could really

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,590
-balance out that dogwood.
-Saving for college?

45
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,384
-Where did you say
you're going? -Oh, I'm applying

to a few different
engineering programs.

47
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,304
Just saving money this year
so I can go next fall.

48

I'm gonna get you.

a Thunder Bomber?

Number one of all time.

60
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,964
-My dad can do the best.
-No pressure.

61
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,924
Yeah, I'll sure give it
a shot, little dude.

62
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,509
MR. ALLEN: You gonna be good
for Mr. Corey?

63
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,762
-Corey. Could I talk
to you for a sec? -Yeah.

JEREMY:
Here comes the Thunder Bomber!

65
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,016
I'm gonna put the candy
on the porch.

66
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,602
Trick-or-treat kids
can help themselves.

67
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,896
Help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

68
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,315
MR. ALLEN: She made zucchini
bread. It's actually good.

-(chuckling)
-You have my number.

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,860
-Okay.
-If there's an emergency,

71
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,653
but we'll just be
right down the street.

72
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,489
-JEREMY: Crash! -(door closes)
-(inhales deeply)

73
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,866
And there is one thing
I need to tell you.

74
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,702
Since last Halloween--
all the events and,

75
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,206
you know, the headlines
of Michael Myers--

76
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,041
Jeremy's been afraid
of the dark.

77
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,460
(whispering): He's been
wetting the bed at night.

78
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,047
And, um, bedtime has been
difficult. (chuckles)

79
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,465
JEREMY:
I can hear you!

80
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,175
Uh, I can read him a story
or something.

81
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,886
-Does he have a favorite book?
-Then once he goes to bed,

82
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,471
he talks in his sleep.

83
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,931
Says he hears voices.

84
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,724
He's just really
sensitive to things

85
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,559
-that give him bad dreams.
-Right. All that just sounds

86
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,436
like normal kid
imagination stuff, right?

87
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,938
-(Jeremy yelling playfully)
-(door opens)

88
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,274
-No TV and no more candy.
-(door closes)

89
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,112
You guys can play
till 8:30, 8:45.

90
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,447
Then he should go to bed.

91
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,282
-Easy money.
-Yes.

92
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,368
JEREMY:
Gonna come play with me or what?

93
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,453
-(chuckling)
-That sounds like a threat.

94
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,247
It's Halloween.

95
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,582
We're gonna have
a good time tonight.

96
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,084
-(crickets chirping)
-(dog barking in distance)

97
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,837
(man screaming on TV)

98
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,757
JEREMY:
Oh.

99
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,217
-Ugh.
-COREY: Look, man, we can

100
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,428
shut it off if you're scared
of monster movies.

101
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,638
No. No. You're scared.

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,016
(chuckling): I'm 21 years old.
I don't get scared.

103
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,226
You're scared because you know
Michael Myers is...

104
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,186
(whispers):
still out there.

105
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,564
Boogeyman's gonna get you.

106
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,774
JEREMY:
He's not gonna get me.

107
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,736
Michael Myers kills
babysitters, not kids.

108
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,699
(screaming)

109
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,952
Okay, that's actually
pretty disgusting

110
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,954
and probably not appropriate
for kids.

111
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,622
Why don't we
shut this off, and...

112
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,041
we can play hide-and-seek
before bed.

113
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,625
Your parents are gonna
be home soon and...

114
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,627
I don't want to play
no hide-and-seek.

115
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,005
It's stupid.
I want to watch this movie.

116
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,507
And I don't really feel like
pretending to be best friends

117
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,801
with an ugly-ass
boy babysitter.

118
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,641
Okay, five minutes,
and then you're going to bed.

119
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,977
You suck at babysitting.

120
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,521
I'm not a babysitter.

121
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,888

123
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,559
Turn that movie off!

124
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,064
Jeremy?

125
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,069
(mutters):
What are you doing?

126
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,036

Jeremy?

133
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,193
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

134
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,034
Boo!

135
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,080
This isn't funny, Jeremy.

-(grunts)

137

JEREMY:
He's gonna get you!

He's gonna get you
when you least expect it.

Corey? -Okay, Jeremy...

JEREMY (mocking): "Come out,
come out, wherever you are."

You got me, buddy.
Okay, let me out.

Jeremy, let me out. Let me out!

159

You little shit!
Let me out of here!

JEREMY (chuckling):
Michael Myers.

161
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,210
-Jeremy, it's not funny, okay?
-(Jeremy laughing)

162

163
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,133
COREY: Hey, you're gonna
get us both in trouble.

164
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,468
(keys jingling)

165
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,805
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!

166
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,849
You little shit!

167
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,060
-I'm gonna kill you, Jeremy!
-(banging)

168
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,853
-(grunts)
-JEREMY: Boo!

169
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,606
-What was that?
-(Jeremy screams)

170
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,400
(gasps)

171
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,235
MR. ALLEN:
Jeremy!

172
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,322
-Oh, no! Oh, God, no! Please!
-Jeremy!

173
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,783
-Oh, no. Oh, God.
-(whimpers) Jeremy!

174
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,701
Oh, my God! Jeremy!

175
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,204
(Mrs. Allen whimpering,
sobbing)

176
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,331
-MR. ALLEN: Jeremy.
-MRS. ALLEN: Jeremy!

177
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,125
God, please, no!

178
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,754
What have you done?!

179
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,049

(school bell ringing)

185
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,191
LAURIE: Haddonfield was
a peaceful town.

186
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,778
And then one Halloween night
many years ago,

187
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,405
all of that was lost.

188
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,369
Michael Myers was pure evil.

189
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,495
(sobbing)

190
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,704
He took our dreams

191
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,498
and turned them into nightmares.

192
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:56,049
As he was locked away
in his prison...

193
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,803
...I disappeared into mine.

194
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,097
(gunshots)

195
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,313
And then, as I predicted,

196
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,191
40 years later, he escaped,

197
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,902
and Haddonfield was once again
forced to confront

198
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,987
this man in a mask.

199
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,991
(muffled, distorted screaming)

200
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,916
His senseless brutality
ravaged my community...

201
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,918
(muffled, distorted whimpering)

202
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,962
...and killed my daughter.

203
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,965
* *

204
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,301
And then he vanished.

205
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,847
Impossible?

206
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,932
Perhaps.

207
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,978
Truth would evolve into legend

208
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,398
as people searched
for motive and meaning,

209
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,526
looking in the shadows
for their boogeyman.

210
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,653
(thunder crashes)

211
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,321
(muffled, distorted sobbing)

212
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,659
It was an accident.

213
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,287
LAURIE:
In the years that followed,

214
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,248
the people of Haddonfield
descended into a plague

215
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,668
of grief, of blame, of paranoia.

216
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,212
OFFICER:
Do you think he's come back?

217
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,049
Michael doesn't use guns.

218
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,718
LAURIE:
The suffering Michael caused

219
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,179
became an infection
passing on to people

220
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,222
who never even
crossed his path.

221
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,809
And as the town
turned in on itself,

222
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:33,897
I made a promise not to let
fear rule my life anymore.

223
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,523
(birds chirping)

224
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,983
I bought a home.

225
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,487
A place to live
with love and trust.

226
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,905
Not a trap.

227
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,115
Not a place to hide.

228
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,619
Hey.

229
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,287
It has been four years

230
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,040
since I last saw my monster.

231
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,797
So here I am, a survivor
attempting to share my story

232
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,299
and find healing.

233
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,263
Michael Myers was
the personification of evil.

234
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,019
It's theirs.

235
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,271
It's their wedding rings.

236
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,652
It's up to each of us

237
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,862
whether or not we lock the door

238
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,115
and find our resolve...

239
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,535
...or let him inside.

240
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,423
Let it inside.

241
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,515
Let evil...

242
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,267
inside.

243
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,813
-(wind whistling)
-(alarm beeping)

244
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,898
Allyson! Darn it!

245
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,651
-Honey, I'm so sorry!
-What is it?

246
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,069
Oh, fuck!

247
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,489
Um, it's my pie.
I put a pie in the oven.

248
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,241
Oh, shit!

249
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,618
Oh, I must have forgotten
to set the timer.

250
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,328
Damn it!

251
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,831
Darn it!
No, no, no, no, Oh, no.

252
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,499
I can get a pie from the store.

253
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,086
No! I wanted to bake you
a pumpkin pie.

254
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,796
It's a Halloween tradition.

255
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,506
-(alarm stops)
-(sighs)

256
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,508
(groans)

257
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,511
-Are you...
-I got to go.

258
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,096
-I'm late for work.
-(sighs): Okay.

259
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,057
But do you have your costume
for the party?

260
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,100
I told you,
I don't want to go alone.

261
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,935
So I'm not going.

262
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,771
(sighs)

263
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,356
Oh.

Giving you the Urge,

266
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,324
Haddonfield's home for rock.

WILLIE THE KID: It is
four days until Halloween.

268
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,745
-Can you believe it?
-(horn honks)

269
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,456
It's time to lock your doors,
grab your knife for the fight.

270
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,999
You ready? You ready in case

271
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,126
the Boogeyman decides
to come out and play?

272
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,670
(over radio):
I know I am.

273
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,755
But let's talk about that
Michael Myers for a minute.

274
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,424
How does one man get shot at,
stabbed up

275
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,260
and then he fall
down the street and get back up

276
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,180
to scare the piss out of
everybody in Haddonfield?

277
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,808
Let me tell you how--
'cause this isn't a man.

278
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,687
This is more than a man.
This is a beast. (growls)

279
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,522
One that doesn't bleed...

280
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,483
I'm pretty sure
that was in the change order.

281
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,735
Hold-hold on a second, Shannon.

282
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,570
Hey, Corey, you're late!

283
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,531
You're late again!

284
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,574
WILLIE THE KID (over radio):
It's been four years.

285
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,534
Where y'all at?

286
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,494
Training for the big day,
perhaps?

287
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,579
Getting yourself in the spirit?

288
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,623
This Boogeyman been sitting
in hibernation,

289
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,126
but trust me, y'all,
he'll be back.

290
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,046
I'm Willie the Kid,
and I'll be creeping it real

291
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,381
on 94.9 WUR...

292
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,383
Corey, you got a second?

293
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,099
What do you think?

294
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,768
Yeah.

295
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,353
Get it registered.

296
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,272
Get some new plates.

297
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,358
-I got no use for it no more.
-Are you serious?

298
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,527
With a good engine pushing you,
finally make it

299
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,696
to work on time,
you know what I mean?

300
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,197
Does it work?

301
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,325
Yeah, it works,
just kind of shitty.

302
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,957
Hey, uh, Ronald?

303
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,126
Thanks.

304
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,878
No problem, kid.

305
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,922
(metallic rattling)

306
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,091

(engine shuts off)

308
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,774
You're under arrest.

309
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,859
For being the prettiest girl
I know.

310
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,194
That's nice, Doug.

311
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,571
Is that why you pulled me over?

312
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,074
No. I pulled you over
'cause I miss you.

313
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,533
You miss me?

314
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,077
(chuckling):
Just kidding.

315
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,328
Pulled you over
'cause it looks like

316
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,746
your muffler's about
to fall off.

317
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,247
Better get that fixed
before you have a bigger

318
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,541
-problem on your hands.
-(engine starts)

319

00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,019
* Stop the water climbing *

324
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,021
* Get to the shore *

325
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,315
* There's a hole in the boat *

326
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,693
* And it won't stay afloat *

327
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,820
(fades in distance):
* Oilliphéist... *

328
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,625
(entry bell chimes)

329
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,961
(rock music playing low
through speakers)

330
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,338
PROPRIETOR: You gonna buy
something or what?

331
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,427
BILLY:
I could've drove here.

332
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,970
STACY: Chill.
I'm the designated driver.

333
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,347
-I know how to drive.
-Don't mess up my car, please.

334
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,807
-I'm not gonna mess up your car.
-All right?

335
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,642
-Don't mess it up.
-Chill. (chuckles)

336
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,269
-His dad is...
-I got my license.

337
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,354
It's no hating on. Come on.

338
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,648
-TERRY: Billy. I.D.?
-STACY: So what's the plan?

339
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,775
-Give me the I.D. -I.D.?
-(entry bell chimes)

340
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,235
-Yeah.
-It got confiscated last week.

341
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,570
-I told you.
-She's got the money.

342
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,821
-You don't have your I.D.?
-Wait. You what?

343
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,031
-Wait. Hold on. Hey, yo!
-I lost it.

344
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,241
Wait. (chuckles) New friend.

345
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,702
What, drinking a little milk.
(chuckles)

346
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,454
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I like milk, too.

347
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,330
-Look, here's the deal, man.
-(Billy wolf whistles)

348
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,041
We're seniors, okay?

349
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,335
We've been practicing for our
show the whole year, you know.

350
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,337
Loading up for,
uh, tonight's game and--

351
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,630
Well, we're in
the fucking marching band.

352
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,300
We were just hoping you could
be a cool new friend, you know.

353
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,843
Just buy us
a couple of six-packs.

354
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,805
(chuckles, grunts)

355
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,184
Just-just for me and my crew.
Come on, man. (chuckles)

356
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,977
Uh, no.

357
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,563
No?

358
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,106
No-no, thank you? What?

359
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,566
-No, I can't.
-STACY: Oh, wait.

360
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,735
-I know who you are.
-You did something messy.

361
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,945
-STACY: I can't believe they
let you off. -Well, who is he?

362
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,489
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

363
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,033
You're that psycho babysitter.

364
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,326
He killed that kid, didn't he?

365
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,994
-Yep.
-Killed a kid and too pussy

366
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,371
-to buy us some fucking beer?
-MARGO: Guys, you know what?

367
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,622
Let's just fucking
forget about it.

368
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's just go
to the game, okay?

369
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,625
-You're just a little pedo.
-Look at him.

370
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,668
-Let him know, Terry.
-That what you are?

371
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,919
A little fucking pedo creep?

372
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,379
-That's right.
-Get in his face, Terry.

373
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,963
What kind of
fucked-up kid are you?

374
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:14,756
-That's right. -Right.
-So where's your next victim?

375
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,841
-Whoa!
-What the fuck?!

376
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,842
Are you kidding me, man?

377
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,219
-(pained shout)
-STACY: Oh, shit.

378
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,595
-(laughter)
-(Corey groans)

379
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,971
(panting)

380
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,473
-BILLY: Look at you.
-MARGO: What the fuck, Terry?

381
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,891
BILLY:
Got fucking milk everywhere.

382
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,601
-MARGO: Holy shit.
-BILLY: Look what you did.

383
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,145
LAURIE:
Hey! Assholes!

384
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,730
Knock it off!

385
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,898
-We're not doing anything.
-We're just talking, miss.

386
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,733
-We're messing around.
-Ma'am.

387
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,485
-(laughter)
-TERRY: Hey, guys.

388
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,736
Would you look at this?

389
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,446
I mean, a psycho
meets a freak show.

390
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,781
-Wow.
-BILLY: Can't believe it.

391
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,408
TERRY:
This is a match made in heaven.

392
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,159
-Hey, come on. Look at me.
-Ta-ta for now.

393
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,619
Let's go, y'all.

394
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,413
(whispers):
Michael Myers.

395
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,914
(Corey breathes heavily)

396
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,582
(Stacy laughing)

397
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,001
(glass clinks on ground)

398
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,086
LAURIE: Are you the psycho
or the freak show?

399
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,922
Hey, Margo, do you want to go
to the school play on Saturday?

400
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,757
-MARGO: Yeah, sure, Terry.
-Have fun.

401
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,010
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

402
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,931
So, do you want to do it,
or you want me to?

403
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,478
-(air hissing)
-(grunts)

404
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,110
ALLYSON:
Look at it.

405
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,111
DEB:
Are you kidding?

406
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,320
It looks great on you.

407
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,031
I'm sure it does,
but I'm not going.

408
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,950
Once you put the whole outfit
on, you'll love it.

409
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,245
I say if it's not sexy,
it's not Halloween.

410
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,915
Well, someone's getting into
the spirit of things.

411
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,796
This gentleman had an accident
and needs a little fix-up.

412
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,923
DR. MATHIS: You have
significant inflammation.

413
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,135
Um, I'm gonna be nice
and numb it here

414
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,304
so my assistant can
clean it up really well,

415
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,682
and then I will get back
and close it with a suture.

416
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,521
You're gonna feel
a little bit of a pinch here.

417
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,150
Cute, isn't she?

418
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,485
I don't-- Ow!

419
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,320
-Jesus Christ!
-ALLYSON: Sorry. Sorry.

420
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,905
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Allyson, what are you doing?

421
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,281
-COREY: It's my fault. Sorry.
-Allyson!

422
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,407
-No.
-ALLYSON: Sorry, sorry.

423
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,159
No. No, my fault.
It was my fault.

424
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,994
-I-I'm so sorry. Oh, geez.
-DR. MATHIS: What a mess.

425
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,455
Just clean it up
and get a goddamn sterile kit.

426
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,040
And give him a tetanus shot.

427
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,042
I'll be back.

428
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,511
You shouldn't let that guy
talk to you like that.

429
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,766
It's gonna make you sad, even
if you don't think it does.

430
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,644
I've dealt with much worse.

431
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,022
But thank you.

432
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,526
Anyway, I've just been
dealing with it.

433
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,779
Well, I'm supposed to
get this promotion.

434
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,573
-But either way, it's just...
-Is it worth it?

435
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,536
What'd you do?

436
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,246
-Uh...
-To your hand?

437
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,748
Uh, I was at work, and then
I had a little accident.

438
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,709
-So your job sucks, too.
-Hmm?

439
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,460
Where do you work?
What do you do?

440
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,879
-COREY: Oh, a mechanic shop.
-Don't move.

441
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,549
-Don't want to get infected.
-(glass clinks in tray)

442
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,217
So my car's been rattling.

443
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,927
-Rattling?
-Yeah.

444
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,179
Uh, it's just your exhaust
system clamp's come loose.

445
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,973
It's an easy fix.
It takes like five minutes.

446
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,017
Super cinchy.

447
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,770
You just need a lift
and two screws.

448
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:16,938
"Cinchy"?

449
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,399
You don't
have to fix it right now.

450
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,777
Yeah, I don't have
my stuff, but...

451
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,988
I am at the shop tomorrow.

452
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,197
I can fix it then.

453
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,575
Why can't the bicycle
stand on its own?

454
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,076
No, no. It can.

455
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,619
It's got a kickstand.

456
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,414
'Cause it was too tired.

457
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,875
(laughing)

458
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,043
Yeah.

459
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,046
Oh, I'm actually
getting rid of the bike,

460
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,089
so if you want it,
you can have it.

461
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,591
I got a motorcycle.

462
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,384
-Oh, a motorcycle?
-Yeah.

463
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,636
Teach me to ride it?

464
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,306
Yeah.

465
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,600
You have shit on your back.

466
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,478
I'll get it.

467
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,275
We should go out sometime
and do something.

468
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,527
-With me?
-With both of us.

469
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,945
I mean,
we'd both have to be there.

470
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,448
Otherwise, it wouldn't be
a very good time.

471
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,700
(Corey chuckles)

472
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,869
Yeah, you don't want
to do that.

473
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,081
Uh, I'm gonna be late
for dinner.

474
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,336
But, uh, I appreciate the hand.

475
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,588
It feels better already.

476
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,465
ALLYSON:
So you did that on purpose.

477
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,466
LAURIE:
What?

478
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,842
He was injured,

479
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,636
he needed medical attention,
and Dr. Mathis

480
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,054
-is the best in town.
-Do you believe her?

481
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,764
-Do not believe a word she says.
-(chuckles)

482
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,391
-You know, she's a strategist.
-Fine, fine, fine.

483
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,642
She's just trying
to play Cupid.

484
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:36,559
Thought he was cute.
Seemed nice.

485
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,602
Are you gonna call him

486
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,645
and invite him to her party,

487
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,063
or you gonna just go alone?

488
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,731
LINDSAY:
Now pick a card. Mm-hmm.

489
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,191
Oh, no. I got the death card.

490
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,984
-No, that's not bad in tarot.
-LAURIE: Mm-mm.

491
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,862
LINDSAY: No, that just means
a major phase is ending

492
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,280
and a new one
is about to begin.

493
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,825
So, that pretty much puts
a nail in the coffin

494
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,993
with that police officer
you were dating.

495
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,788
-Ugh, Doug.
-(Lindsay chuckles)

496
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,290
You know, you need to find
someone that can let go.

497
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,292
That makes you want
to rip off your shirt

498
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,753
and show grief
your fucking tits and say,

499
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,755
"You know what? Let's go."

500
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,717
-JOAN: This is delicious.
-(TV playing quietly)

501
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,177
Corey. Is it infected?

502
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,054
Is your hand infected?
What did the doctor say?

503
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,514
He said
it's gonna be fine, Mama.

504
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,974
He said that
you don't need to worry,

505
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,684
and he said it would be
terrific is what he said.

506
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,519
Well, I just might have to send
him back to the call center

507
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,188
to work for DeVon if you can't
give him proper supervision.

508
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,482
I can't keep my eyes
on every second.

509
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,735
(phone buzzing)

510
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,030
JOAN:
What the hell are you doing?

511
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,115
Who's that calling you
under the dinner table?

512
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,409
COREY:
Uh, it's no one, Mama.

513
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,454
JOAN: Who's that person
you're texting?

514
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:38,663
(buzzing)

515
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,707
It's no one.

516
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,293
(sighs)

517
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,796
Boys who keep secrets
don't get custard for dessert.

518
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,720
Don't tell her about
the motorcycle, then.

519
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,639
(engine revving)

520
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,241
Ford station wagon.

521
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,536
-(engine rattling and clanking)
-Hold on one second.

522
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,997
Something I can help you with?

523
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,125
Corey said
I should bring it in.

524
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,091
(engine shuts off)

525
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,884
Get on.

526
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,305
Okay, so...

527
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,349
(Corey grunts, sniffs)

528
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,767
Okay.

529
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,103
Uh, right hand, gas.
Left hand is your front--

530
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,354
Fuck. Uh, sorry.

531
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,982
Right hand is gas,
also your front brake.

532
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,610
And then left hand
is your, uh, clutch.

533
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,946
Right foot is your back brake.

534
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,282
And, uh, left foot is
the shifter thingy.

535
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,492
Simple.

536
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,703
Doesn't sound simple.

537
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,371
RONALD:
Yo, Corey!

538
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,498
Come give us a hand.

539
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,291
-Hey, Ron.
-Hey, Terry.

540
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,043
TERRY'S FATHER: I'm sorry
to bother you with this shit.

541
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,254
My goddamn son drove
three miles on a fucking flat

542
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,964
'cause he doesn't know
how to change a tire

543
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,757
on a goddamn automobile.

544
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,800
Fucking genius.

545
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,594
Uh... I got it.

546
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,888
TERRY'S FATHER:
Yeah, and fucking smarten up.

547
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,348
(indistinct chatter continues)

548
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,852
I'm gonna go help Ronald
and then fix the rattle.

549
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,437
Your rattle. Your car's, uh...

550
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,982
I don't care about the rattle.
I came to see you.

551
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,650
RONALD:
We'll take care of her.

552
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,360
Just got to be
a little smarter, kid.

553
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:36,072
Three pounds of ground chuck,
right here on the top. (sighs)

554
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,074
-FRANK: Thank you.
-Be right back with the lean.

555
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,827
Jesus, Frank, have you ever
heard of a vegetable?

556
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,412
Well, look who it is.

557
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,165
(grunts, laughs)

558
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,833
-They're good for you.
-Well, I like to

559
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,002
mix meats and make croquettes
for the guys at the station.

560
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:52,213
(laughs): Okay,
that just sounds disgusting.

561
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,092
I like your hair.

562
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,927
Thanks.

563
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,847
Thanks. I, uh...

564
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,391
I just sort of
chopped it one day.

565
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:06,603
It just was--
It felt like time.

566
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,021
Wow.

567
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,314
Somebody else fixed it.

568
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,690
-Help.
-Yeah.

569
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,025
There goes your lean.

570
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,735
-Ah. Thank you, Travis.
-Have a good day.

571
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,612
-Okay.
-See ya.

572
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,865
But I tell you, I-I feel like
I won an extra life.

573
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,326
-Mm.
-I really do.

574
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,203
I got myself a guitar
at the pawnshop,

575
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,913
and I've been
fiddling around with that,

576
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,207
and my niece gave me
a Rosetta Stone,

577
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,001
-and now I'm learning Japanese.
-Mm.

578
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,671
(speaks Japanese)

579
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,256
-What does that mean?
-It means I lost my shirt.

580
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,717
-I think. Or I lost my hat.
-(laughs)

581
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,761
I don't know. I... (laughs)

582
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,429
Uh... (stammers)

583
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,681
Thanks.

584
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,058
Uh, (clears throat) who knows?

585
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,060
Maybe I'll fly over
for the cherry blossoms.

586
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:49,437
Test it out on the locals.

587
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,317
You still got your nose in
that, uh, book you're writing?

588
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,904
Your fault. It was your idea.

589
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,198
-It was?
-(register beeping)

590
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,533
-No, I'm...
-Got a title?

591
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:02,784
Just set up my office.

592
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,369
You know, I have a house
with Allyson.

593
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,830
We're living together.
It's nice.

594
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,040
Uh...

595
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,669
You know, she's been
talking to this guy.

596
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,380
You probably know him.

597
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,589
Corey Cunningham.

598
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,009
Oh, yeah. I do know.

599
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,678
He's a good kid.
Had a tough break.

600
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,765
It's nice to know somebody's
out there looking out for him.

601
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,225
I like your face.

602
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,310
I mean, I like
seeing your face.

603
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,311
So do you.

604
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,272
I mean...

605
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,066
I do, too.
I like seeing you, too.

606
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,827
Hi.

607
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,584
WOMAN:
Hey.

608
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,960
What you smiling about?

609
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:56,212
What did you buy at the store?

610
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,342
-I'm sorry?
-"I'm sorry?"

611
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,428
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

612
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,305
Do you see what he did
to my sister?

613
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,975
He killed her husband,
and he stabbed her.

614
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,143
Took her voice!

615
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:13,938
She cannot speak because of you!

616
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,523
You were her neighbor,

617
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,400
and you don't even know
her name, do you?

618
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:21,196
You tempted
and you provoked that man

619
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,657
when you should've
left him alone.

620
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,409

621
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,372
Laurie.

622
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,505
Hey.

623
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,676
You okay?

624
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,094
Yeah.

625
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:47,222
I would like to see
those cherry blossoms.

626
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,100
And I think
you'd like 'em, too.

627
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,397
WILLIE THE KID: Whoo!
Who knows what to believe?

628
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,816
I think the man who escaped
Smith's Grove in 1978

629
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,276
was not the same man
who killed all those people.

630
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:01,903
The real Michael Myers
was murdered that night,

631
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,364
and the heavy breather
with the mask was the same man

632
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,990
who poisoned Pope John Paul I.

633
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,450

634

I know what it's like to have

thinking that they know you,

But when I look at you--
when I saw you the other day,

742
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,487
I just saw a person.

743
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:57,949

But the difference, Allyson,
between me and you

746
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,917
is that people look at me like,

"Who is this guy?
Who is this monster?"

748

They see you like a survivor.

-He hates me, right?
-Hey!

795
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,624
Billy, knock it off. Billy!

796
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,001
-(Stacy laughing)
-He hates me?

797
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,753
-MARGO: Terry, what the fuck?!
-(Corey screams)

798
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,921
-BILLY: Oh, shit!
-(Corey grunts, body thuds)

799
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,007
-STACY: Oh, shit.
-MARGO: Oh, my God.

800
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,842
-Oh, shit.
-Terry, what did you do?!

801
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,136
-He fell.
-Little dick busted it.

802
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:24,971
-MARGO: Is he dead?
-STACY: Go down and look.

803
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,140
-No, you go down and look.
-What the fuck?

804
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:29,517
I didn't push nobody. He fell.

805
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,602
-Bullshit.
-He fell?

806
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,145
Yeah, that's my story.

807
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,147
Let's get out of here.

808
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,441
STACY: Who's the psycho now,
Terry? Who's the psycho?

809
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,650
BILLY:
Little prick deserved it.

810
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:38,985
TERRY:
Get in the car, Margo.

811
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,278
MARGO (crying):
We killed a kid, man.

812
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,988
BILLY:
Come on.

813
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,156
(car door closes)

814
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,658
(car drives off)

815
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,496
MAN (quietly):
* There's a hole in the boat *

816
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,706
* And it won't stay afloat *

817
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,544
* Oilliphéist in the sea *

818
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:58,838
(body dragging)

819
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,551
* Nail my hands to the door *

820
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:05,887
* And my knees to the floor *

821
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:11,559
* To stop the water
till we reach the shore. *

822
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,188
(loud banging)

823
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,856
Hey, what's happening?

824
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,108
ALLYSON: Just-- I can't get
this fucking thing to turn on.

825
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,776
LAURIE:
Okay, okay. Take a breath.

826
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:20,694
-Okay, take a deep breath.
-Just let me be mad!

827
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,696
Why can't I be mad?!

828
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,447
-You can.
-(sighs)

829
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,032
You can be mad.

830
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,742
-You can be very, very mad,
-(microwave beeping)

831
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,369
and you can smash things.

832
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,371
Just be careful.
It's addictive.

833
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,623
(microwave whirring)

834
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,300
ALLYSON:
You were right.

835
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:45,593
I liked him.

836
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:47,387
LAURIE:
Yeah.

837
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:48,888
(food pops)

838
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,517
(squeaking)

839
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,604
(breathing heavily)

840
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:58,898
* *

841
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,697
(soft, shuddering breaths)

842
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,128
* *

843
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,891
(water dripping)

844
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,523
(gasping)

845
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,987
(thudding)

846
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,699
(yelping, gasping)

847
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,451
(breathing heavily)

848
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,703

851
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:24,192
(screams)

852
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:37,288
(grunting, gasping)

853
00:41:57,892 --> 00:42:00,103
(slow, heavy breathing)

854
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,817
-You see that man in there?
-(gasps)

855
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,738
He take people in there
now and then.

856
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,742
Why'd he let you live?

857
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:15,994
I say you go back.

858
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:19,205
You go back in there,
and you get me that mask.

859
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:21,499
I'm Michael Myers.

860
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,960
-The fuck?
-(laughing)

861
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:27,589
He not done with you,
you little fuck.

862
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,299
(grunting)

863
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,259
(knife squishes)

864
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:33,720
(whimpering)

865
00:42:34,554 --> 00:42:35,930
-(knife squishes)
-(grunts)

866
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:38,725
-(knife squishes)
-(grunts)

867
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,270
(grunts, gasps)

868
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:44,356
(panting)

869
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:54,532
(grunts)

870
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:56,284
(panting)

871
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,704
* *

872
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:03,416
(dog barking in distance)

873
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,668
JOAN:
Hey!

874
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,961
Where have you been?

875
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,131
I have been worried sick!

876
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:14,094
Corey, I almost called
the missing persons.

877
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:15,970
-What is going on with you?
-(banging at door)

878
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:18,306
Corey, I'm talking to you.

879
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:21,142
She's no good, damn it.

880
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,727
Open the door.

881
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,689
-Open the door!
-(banging at door)

882
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,108
Are you trying to kill me?

883
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,444
Corey? Corey?

884
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:33,738
(faucet running)

885
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:40,161
(glass squeaks)

886
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:43,123
(breathing heavily)

887
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:45,166
* *

888
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,671
DEB: No hard feelings
about the promotion, right?

889
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,131
Course not. You deserve it.

890
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,008
(chuckles)
I thought for sure Dr. Mathis

891
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,968
was gonna make you
the charge nurse.

892
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,762
Deb, can I speak to you
a minute?

893
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:05,145
Okay, Deb, I'm gonna
tell you once...

894
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:07,939
-(door closes)
-(indistinct conversation)

895
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,739
LAURIE:
People create their own stories

896
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,824
and make their own choices.

897
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,619
They believe
what they want to believe.

898
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:24,164
I'm hopeful, with perspective,

899
00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:27,208
that my experience
will help others heal.

900
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,294
(engine revs)

901
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,797
You have to ask yourself,
"Am I in control,

902
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,342
"or do the elements control me?

903
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:37,093
"Life or death.

904
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:41,431
Suicide or cherry blossoms."

905
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:44,476
(motorcycle engine
buzzing outside)

906
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:57,739
* *

907
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,091
-Hi.
-(gasps)

908
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,509
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

909
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,135
I'm just waiting for Allyson.

910
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,472
ALLYSON:
Corey?

911
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,269
Everything okay?

912
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:32,607
Uh, I got jumped
on the way home last night.

913
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,859
These guys...

914
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:41,241
Those kids from the gas station
that were messing with me--

915
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:44,285
I tried to stand up for myself,
and they, um...

916
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,289
Oh, I'm sorry.

917
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:53,962
I just came 'cause
I wanted to talk to you.

918
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,214
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
and there's...

919
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,465
no excuse.

920
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,592
But if you could, please,
if you could just

921
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:01,678
take a walk with me.

922
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,805
Please?

923
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,943
* *

924
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,993
I killed someone.

925
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:37,172
* *

926
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:53,605
(clattering)

927
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:10,121
(notes play flatly)

928
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,000
We were making paper planes,

929
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:16,836
but he wanted to watch
a monster movie.

930
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:18,963
* *

931
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,633
Everything happened so fast.

932
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:28,390
I just wanted it
to be a fun night.

933
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,937
That's all, just...
a good night.

934
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,444
And then it all went bad.

935
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,617
ALLYSON:
I heard what happened.

936
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,246
I know it sounds crazy,
but when...

937
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,958
people would talk about it,
it was like I knew you.

938
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,336
Like I was looking for you.

939
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:00,588
And then she brought you to me.

940
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:06,136
(high-pitched whistling)

941
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:10,015
Has he done something bad?

942
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,474
I don't understand
why you're here.

943
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:14,269
No, no. He's seeing
my granddaughter.

944
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,062
I introduced them, actually.

945
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:17,897
Your granddaughter
should be so lucky

946
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:19,733
as to be with a boy like Corey.

947
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,027
He's handsome. He's sensitive.

948
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,070
(sighs) I don't like it
when he stays out

949
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,948
all night with girls,
but he's grown.

950
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,284
He can do what he wants.

951
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,079
Yes.

952
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,585
I know he's had
his difficulties.

953
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:40,795
My son.

954
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,213
This town turned against him

955
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:43,923
after the accident
with Jeremy Allen.

956
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:45,342
They would've felt for him.

957
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:46,718
They would've helped him heal.

958
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,596
But because your boogeyman
disappeared,

959
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:51,639
they needed a new one.

960
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,645
I'm sorry.

ALLYSON: After my mom
and dad were killed,

962
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,943
I just wanted
to burn it all to the ground

963
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:06,446
-and get away from Haddonfield.
-Why not leave?

964
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,114
Why stay?

965
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,617
All my memories are here.

966
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,162
I think both your parents
got killed

967
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,955
and your grandma
feels guilty about it,

968
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,415
so she's making you her child.

969
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,626
If you could've seen her
before therapy,

970
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,628
sobering up, and me...

971
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,380
I'm just terrified to think
what would happen

972
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:25,131
if she were all alone
if I left.

973
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:27,050
So, what, you got to stay here,
protect her

974
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,635
from herself forever?

975
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:33,598
Look...

976
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,017
I'm sorry I lost my head
at the party

977
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,144
and I walked away.

978
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,105
That was a mistake.

979
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,525
When I look at you, I...

980
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:48,154
I know I can tell you
the truth.

981
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:50,323
I'm not afraid of these people.

982
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:52,492
I'm not afraid anymore.

983
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,662
You tell me that you want
to burn it down,

984
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:57,580
or you tell me you want
to burn it to the ground.

985
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,834

Hey. Twice in one week.

Pretty cool. Hot diggity.

987

Hey, you said you, uh...
you were gonna call.

988

You were... you were gonna call,
but you didn't call.

989
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,092
No, I owe you a call.

990
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,302
Did I... did I do
something wrong or...

991
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:12,721
I'm with someone.

992
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:14,389
Oh. Oh.

993
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,391
Oops. Uh, sorry for that.

994
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:17,976
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

995
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,270
Well, um, you know, it's, uh...
it's Joe Grillo's, uh...

996
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:21,980
Hey, Joe! Hey.

997
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:23,690
Joe Grillo's birthday today.

998
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,608
And Joe Ross, uh,
he made a sponge cake.

are doing? -We're good.

Oh. Okay, you're good.

1002

Let me tell you, it's, uh...

If you change your mind,
there's...

1004

She said we're good!

No, no. I got this.

Just burn it all to the ground.

00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:00,517
You want to win
the championship with class?

1122
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:01,976
Stop cheating.

1123
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,854
Stop cheating.

1124
01:00:05,438 --> 01:00:07,732
I keep seeing his eyes.

1125
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:09,609
Are we talking about Michael
or this kid?

1126
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,696
Michael's eyes in Corey.

1127
01:00:12,737 --> 01:00:16,658
Lindsay, I was so sure.

1128
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:19,869
Just like the first time.

1129
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:21,663
Hey, Roger.

1130
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:25,917
There's someone
I want you to meet.

1131
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,628
MR. ALLEN:
I always liked Corey.

1132
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,297
You know, some kids, you can
tell they're a pain in the ass,

1133
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:33,008
but Corey was a good kid.

1134
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:35,093
And I just couldn't imagine
he'd be capable

1135
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:37,345
of hurting anyone on purpose.

1136
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:38,847
But with the trial, I...

1137
01:00:38,888 --> 01:00:42,434
just started spinning
with theories, and...

1138
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:43,852
and eventually I thought,

1139
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:45,311
"Give it up.
You're never gonna get closure.

1140
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:46,896
There's no such thing."

1141
01:00:46,938 --> 01:00:49,983
A couple of years go by, and
I'd see him every now and then,

1142
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:51,901
see the way people avoided him

1143
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:54,279
or how they made faces
behind his back,

1144
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,489
which, if I'm honest,
pissed me off.

1145
01:00:56,531 --> 01:00:59,743
Because I felt like
they took my pain...

1146
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:03,955
...my despair,

1147
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,999
and they made it about them.

1148
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,711
And then, yesterday,
I'm on my way to work.

1149
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,212
There he is.

1150
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:14,674
And I think,
"I'm gonna say something,

1151
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:16,092
"prove my wife wrong.

1152
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:19,471
Let's find a way
to forgive this kid."

1153
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:24,601
And I pull up next to him,
and he looks at me,

1154
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,062
and it's not him.

1155
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,190
At least not in the eyes.

1156
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:33,902
And I don't know, man.

1157
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:37,030
The hairs on the back
of my neck stood up.

1158
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,535
Right then, I felt like
I got my answer.

1159
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:46,748
The kid who used to mow
our lawn didn't kill my son.

1160
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,416
I know that.

1161
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,753
But the guy I saw
on the side of the road

1162
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:54,464
was down a dark path.

1163
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:57,926
Did the town do this to him
after the accident?

1164
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:00,261
Or was it always there?

1165
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:07,060
DR. MATHIS: You're just
laughing at all my jokes,

1166
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:09,646
-aren't you?
-(Deb laughs)

1167
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,731
(sighs):
Oh, my God.

1168
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:14,067
All right, Alexa.

1169
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:17,237
Play "Tell Me With Your Eyes"
by Rob Galbraith.

1170
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:18,697
ALEXA: Here's
"Tell Me With Your Eyes..."

1171
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:21,574
This house is so...

1172
01:02:21,616 --> 01:02:22,867
rich.

1173
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:24,077
-(Dr. Mathis sighs)
-(music begins)

1174
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:26,746
(fingers snapping)

1175
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:30,583
Baby, I have been waiting
all day for this.

1176
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:34,337
I've been saving this bottle
of Au Bon Climat.

1177
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:36,965
You looked so fucking hot
at the office today.

1178
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:39,467
-Hmm.
-(sighs)

1179
01:02:39,509 --> 01:02:40,635
Mind if I...

1180
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,470
Bedroom's down the hall.

1181
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:44,055
Clean up. Take a shower.

1182
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,516
In fact,
I'll meet you in there.

1183
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:48,476
(both laugh)

1184
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:50,562
Yes, yes.

1185
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:52,647
* And you wanna love me *

1186
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:53,773
* Say you wanna love me... *

1187
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:55,316
Mm-hmm.

1188
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:57,318
Yes.

1189
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,405
(music continues in distance)

1190
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:03,908
* I don't care about
your social place *

1191
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,787
* All you need is
a look on your face *

1192
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:10,290
* When you wanna love me,
yeah *

1193
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:12,292
* Say you wanna love me *

1194
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:14,753
* If you wanna love me *

1195
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:16,338
* Say you wanna love me *

1196
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:21,176
* Why don't you tell me
with your eyes *

1197
01:03:21,217 --> 01:03:23,303
* If you wanna love me *

1198
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:24,971
* Say you wanna love me... *

1199
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:27,057
Holy shit. (clicks tongue)

1200
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,184
Is there a doctor in the house?

1201
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:33,813
* If you wanna one time,
one time with me, mama *

1202
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:35,190
Yeah, baby. All right.

1203
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:36,858
Got the cheese.
We got the crackers.

1204
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,068
We're ready.

1205
01:03:38,109 --> 01:03:39,361

-(Dr. Mathis grunts)

1207
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,033
Dr. Mathis?

1208
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,454
-(thumping)
-(music stops)

1209
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:50,914
Dr. Mathis?

-(knob creaks)

1211

Dr. Mathis?

1212
01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:10,558
(crickets chirping)

1213
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,310
Dr. Mathis?

1214
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,706

COREY:
After the accident,

1238
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:51,594
I'd ride my bike over here
and I'd sit up on this roof.

1239
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:56,182
And I'd look up at that tower.

1240
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:58,226
Wonder if I could climb
to the top.

1241
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:01,521
It was summoning me.

1242
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:05,775
Like a watchtower or beacon
calling me to live my old life.

1243
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,068
To be happy again.

1244

* Burn it down *

1245
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:13,742
I have something like that, too.

1246
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:17,579
It always gave me hope,
you know, things would--

1247
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,497
well, maybe somehow
things would go back

1248
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:21,666
to the way they used to be.

1249
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:25,754

Infected.

1252

I got to get away from
everybody who knows me.

1253
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:38,725
But I don't, I...

1254
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:41,811
I don't want to go alone.

1255
01:07:48,276 --> 01:07:50,153
Corey, come on.

1256
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,863
-(chuckles)
-Stop.

1257

I think you're scared that
you don't have enough bandages

01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,543
What, are you insane?

01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,379
What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

1264

I'm not interested
in immortality.

Yo, this is private property.

You stop.

I don't know
who the fuck you talking to,

1276
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:39,828
but, uh, I know who you are.

1277
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:42,789
Yeah, I know
the Laurie Strode story.

1278
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:47,168
She teased a man with brain
damage, and then he snapped.

1279
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,712
Look at you.

1280
01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:50,797
You gonna make a little name
for yourself now, huh?

1281
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,091
Walking around with
this dumb bitch right here.

1282
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:54,300
ALLYSON:
You never shut up.

1283
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:55,427
Hear his voice everywhere.

1284
01:08:55,468 --> 01:08:57,429
Oh, you're goddamn right you do.

1285
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,972
And once Willie
get in your ear,

1286
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:02,642
it's like your favorite song
stuck in your head.

1287
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,352
(chuckles)

1288
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,231
Y'all get the hell
up off my property

1289
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,691
before I fuck y'all up.

1290
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:12,277
(door opens)

1291
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:14,154
-All right.
-(door closes)

1292
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:16,656
You're right.

1293
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:19,284
Let's do it.

1294
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,995
I don't want to be
in Haddonfield anymore.

1295
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:23,997
I want to be with you.

1296
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:26,291
* *

1297
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,600
JOAN:
(sniffs) I can smell her on you.

1298
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:46,311
She's trying to take you
away from me, isn't she?

1299
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,021
That's where you go
every night.

1300
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:50,774
Well, I say go.

1301
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:54,903
You go right now!

1302
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:56,988
Get out of my house!

1303
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:01,785
Oh, no. No.

1304
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:13,421
I hope you find love.

1305
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:19,344
(slow, rhythmic knocking)

1306
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,349
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1307
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:29,604
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1308
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,361
Allyson?

1309
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:40,365
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1310
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:45,954
LAURIE:
It's nice to see you.

1311
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:57,757
You know,
there are two kinds of evil.

1312
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,595
There's the evil that exists
as an external force

1313
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:05,473
that threatens the well-being
of the tribe.

1314
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:10,979
Survival depends on
understanding and awareness

1315
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:15,567
and fear of physical threat
to our daily lives.

1316
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:18,653
The other kind of evil
lives inside us.

1317
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:23,491
Like a sickness or an infection.

1318
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:29,539
It's more dangerous because
we may not know we're infected.

1319
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,501
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1320
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:37,922
Am I a bad person?

1321
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:39,966
(laughs)

1322
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:41,926
Are you?

1323
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:43,511
Well...

1324
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:47,474
...we're both fucked-up.

1325
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:51,853
-I want to help you, Corey.
-(chuckles)

1326
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:53,146
Let me help you.

1327
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,315
Or let me find help for you.

1328
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:56,858
You can't have her.

1329
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,819
Allyson is not equipped
for this relationship,

1330
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:02,113
and I will not
let her get hurt.

1331
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:04,074
So stay the fuck away...

1332
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:05,950
You started this!

1333
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:08,870
You brought me in!
You invited me!

1334
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:13,375
But you're the one to blame.

1335
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:17,879
"You want to do it,
or you want me to?"

1336
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,964
* *

1337
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,388
If I can't have her...

1338
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,891
...no one will.

1339
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:35,480
You want to help Allyson?
Let her live her life.

1340
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:40,568
She has me now.

1341
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:49,494
You should give in.

1342
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,540
You should surrender
to that feeling you had

1343
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,084
the first time
you ever looked into his eyes.

1344
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,633
You secretly hope
Michael comes back for you.

1345
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:09,139
(chuckles)

1346
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,099
I'm the psycho.

1347
01:13:12,183 --> 01:13:14,436
You're the freak show.

1348
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:17,063
* *

1349
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,130
(notes play flatly)

1350
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,640
What's wrong?

1351
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:53,767
COREY (over phone):
We need to leave.

1352
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:56,603
I can't right now. I'm working.

1353
01:13:56,644 --> 01:13:58,772
COREY:
Tonight, then.

1354
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:02,609
Will you meet me at 9:00?

1355
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:04,903
At the diner off 74.

1356
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,155
We need to talk about
your grandmother.

1357
01:14:08,656 --> 01:14:11,117
She wants to kill me.

1358
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,078
-What?
-Yeah.

1359
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,121
I can't take it anymore.

1360
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:17,916
It's time to say goodbye
to Haddonfield.

1361
01:14:20,293 --> 01:14:23,046
(Corey panting)

1362
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:26,800
You got something I need.

1363
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:30,679
(both grunting)

1364
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:50,490
(Corey shouts, groans)

1365
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:53,868
You're just a man
in a Halloween mask.

1366
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:55,662
What are you gonna do now?

1367
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:58,331
(both breathing heavily)

1368
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,583
* *

1369
01:15:09,884 --> 01:15:12,095
(breathing heavily)

1370
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:15,807
-(playful chatter)
-(crickets chirping)

1371
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,603
-(entry bell chimes)
-BILLY: Call him after.

1372
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:21,896
I don't want
to go to your house, man.

1373
01:15:21,938 --> 01:15:23,273
Your dad always
fucking yells at us.

1374
01:15:23,314 --> 01:15:24,733
Too fucking bad.
You should've got your own.

1375
01:15:24,774 --> 01:15:26,359
Shouldn't have
any of these anyway.

1376
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:28,028
Why can't we go to her house?
She's the one that's rich.

1377
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:29,195
-Oh, what? Yeah. Shoot.
-TERRY: What the fuck?

1378
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:31,031
What?

1379
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:32,282
(engine revving)

1380
01:15:34,242 --> 01:15:36,119
He's dead! Get in!

1381
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,579
Oh, shit. Shit.

1382
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:54,262
Did you find
what you're looking for?

1383
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:56,598
I imagine you're going
on a wonderful trip.

1384
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,477
-Were you gonna tell me?
-What difference does it make?

1385
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:01,895
It makes a big difference,
Allyson.

1386
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:04,731
I feel he is capable
of real harm.

1387
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,983
Is that what bothers you?

1388
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:10,904
Is it suspicion or paranoia?

1389
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:12,906
Intuition? An inkling?

1390
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:14,157
You got an inkling?

1391
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,618
I went to his home.
I met his mother.

1392
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,912
I know. He told me.

1393
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:21,581
So, you're what?
You're stalking him now?

1394
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,166
-No.
-And you're threatening him.

1395
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:25,627
-What did you say to him?
-I-I see the same thing in him

1396
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,921
-that I saw in Michael.
-Michael.

1397
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:29,673
Michael Myers is who you are.

1398
01:16:29,714 --> 01:16:31,549
You're not listening to me,
Allyson.

1399
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:32,926
I am trying to protect you.

1400
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,427
I don't want your protection!

1401
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:38,556
But you-you can have
a good life, Allyson.

1402
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:39,891
A good life.

1403
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:41,685
Just not with him.

1404
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:44,771
You pretend like you moved on,
but it's bullshit.

1405
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,481
You're actually just obsessed
with death,

1406
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:47,899
like it's some sort of game.

1407
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:49,609
And you're not gonna rest
until you've finished it

1408
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,237
or until everybody else is as
fucking miserable as you are!

1409
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:54,948
I need to get out of here
before this town kills

1410
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:57,826
the one person that actually
makes me feel something.

1411
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,955
-He is on a dark path!
-(sighs)

1412
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:03,623
I'm not gonna
let this happen to you!

1413
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:05,166
You have to believe me!

1414
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:07,919
Believe you?

1415
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,963
You want me to believe you?

1416
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,091
Because of the hysteria
that you caused

1417
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:16,761
when I trusted you,
my friends are dead.

1418
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:18,304
My parents are dead.

1419
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:22,267
You're the one
that's capable of fucking harm!

1420
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:24,728
(gunfire and tires screeching
over headphones)

1421
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:29,149
(cat meows)

1422
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:33,236
(crickets chirping)

1423
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,406
BILLY: You sure
he turned in here, dude?

1424
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:38,033
TERRY: Yeah, it's like
his hideout or something.

1425
01:17:38,074 --> 01:17:39,492
It's where he works.

1426
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:42,120
-His work is a dump.
-It actually is a dump.

1427
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:43,955
STACY: (chuckles) Okay, no,
but seriously, where is he?

1428
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,290
-TERRY: There's the bike.
-Shit, dude, pull over.

1429
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:47,917
STACY:
This is gonna be so crazy.

1430
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,837
-Let's go.
-MARGO: Billy, can you hurry up?

1431
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,464
-Corey!
-You're squishing me.

1432
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,174
-God.
-Where'd he go?

1433
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:55,383
Come out, Corey!

1434
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,262
Corey, I just want to kiss
and make up, my man!

1435
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:00,930
-Come on!
-Stop being a punk!

1436
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:02,849
-(singsongy): Corey!
-Where you at, man?

1437
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:05,101
I'll show you what happens when
you mess with my dad's car!

MARGO: Terry, there's somebody
in the office.

Run it through the wheel.
All right?

1446
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:24,454
We're gonna tie it
to the back of the car,

1447
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,498
and then we'll drag it
till there's nothing left.

that Allyson
was gonna be with you?

The body of Michael Myers

was disposed of
in a midnight procession.

There would be no tombstone,
no memorial.

The mysteries were put to bed,

was to fade with time.

of Haddonfield resident
Laurie Strode.

New beginnings lay ahead.

when to surrender.

I've said goodbye
to my boogeyman,

evil doesn't die.
